Context and Key issues. Antigua and Barbuda’s tourism-dependent economy has been severely impacted
by the global economic and financial crisis. Falling tourism and FDI-related construction activities have
triggered the worst recession in decades and contributed to a sharp decline in government revenue. This
has aggravated an already unsustainable fiscal position resulting from longstanding fiscal imbalances and
accumulation of a large stock of arrears to domestic and external creditors.
Policy framework. The authorities’ main objectives are to restore debt sustainability and set the stage for
a sustained recovery. They initiated a major fiscal adjustment in mid 2009, which has been intensified in
the context of the 2010 budget and will entail a 14½ percent of GDP improvement in the primary balance.
The authorities have also outlined a structural reform agenda to help strengthen the fiscal position and
address vulnerabilities in the financial sector. As fiscal adjustment and structural reforms alone would not
be sufficient to restore debt sustainability, a comprehensive restructuring of the public debt will be
necessary to bring back sustainability.
Request for a SBA. In support of their macroeconomic and structural reform program, the authorities are
requesting a three-year SBA in the amount of SDR 81 million (600 percent of quota). The program entails
considerable risks given the magnitude of the targeted fiscal adjustment and remaining weaknesses in
implementation capacity. However, these are mitigated by signs of strong policy ownership and by the fact
that strong measures have already been implemented in the fiscal area.
Previous Article IV Consultation: The last Article IV Consultation was concluded on
January 18, 2008. The staff report and summing up of the Executive Directors’ discussions and policy
recommendations are available at: http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/cat/longres.cfm?sk=22161.0
Exchange system: Antigua and Barbuda has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3 and 4,
and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current
international transactions.
Data provision is adequate for surveillance and for program monitoring, although significant areas for
improvement remain.
Discussions. Staff teams visited St. Johns during October 12–16, 2009 and March 2–16, 2010. The staff
representatives comprised Messrs W. Samuel (head), A. Brousseau, K. Nassar, and R. Perrelli (all WHD);
Ms. A. Stuart and Mr. H. Sasaki (SPR); and Ms. J. Deslauriers (EXR). The missions met with the
prime minister, the finance minister, other senior government officials, the leader of the opposition, and
representatives of the private sector and labor unions. Mr. Purves (OED) participated in key policy
meetings.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY


Antigua and Barbuda’s economy contracted 7 percent last year, experiencing its
worst recession in decades. The global slowdown has severely affected Antigua and
Barbuda’s economy through its impact on tourist arrivals, FDI inflows and remittances,
and fiscal revenue. The recession and associated fiscal crisis coincides with already
weak public finances and mounting problems in the financial sector, including the
collapse of the Stanford Group and the Trinidad-based CL Financial Group.



Following many years of accumulation of arrears to domestic and external
creditors, the fiscal situation turned critical in 2009 as the recession led to a
20 percent decline in tax revenue. The overall fiscal deficit widened from 6 percent of
GDP in 2008 to about 19 percent in 2009, public debt increased to 115 percent and the
total stock of arrears rose to about 53 percent of GDP, or 45 percent of the outstanding
public debt.



The authorities have taken decisive action to address the fiscal crisis and set the
stage for a sustained recovery. In mid-2009, they implemented strong measures,
including a 20 percent increase in petroleum product prices. Subsequently, with the 2010
budget, they implemented revenue measures amounting to about 4½ percent of GDP,
including an expansion in the VAT base, an increase in import duties, and excise tax on
alcohol and tobacco. On the expenditure side, the budget implies savings of 8 percent of
GDP in relation to the 2009 outturn. The budget targets a 14½ percentage points of GDP
turnaround in the 2010 primary fiscal balance, to a surplus of 3 percent of GDP. In
2011–12, the primary surplus would be strengthened by a further one percent of GDP.



Nonetheless, in the absence of a comprehensive debt restructuring, the public debt
would remain at a very high level as a ratio of GDP. Accordingly, and also to resolve
the large stock of arrears, the authorities have begun discussions with their creditors on a
comprehensive restructuring of both domestic and external debt with the aim of
achieving interest savings of about 4½ percent of GDP in 2010.



Over the medium term, the fiscal structural reforms planned by the authorities will
play a central role in their efforts to further strengthen the fiscal position and
address financial sector vulnerabilities. In the fiscal area, these comprise tax
administration, public financial management, social security, and civil service reforms.
In the financial sector, onsite inspection of banks by the ECCB will be stepped up and
the regulatory and prudential framework will be strengthened.



Given their strong and comprehensive policy framework for restoring debt
sustainability, and despite considerable risks, the authorities’ proposed program
merits the Fund support through the requested SBA. The proposed access level
reflects the large financing needs and takes into account the strong upfront adjustment
effort and reform agenda. The staff is of the view that the authorities are in compliance
with the Fund’s policy on arrears, based on their good faith efforts to engage with their
external creditors and commitment to clear all arrears to multilateral institutions.

I. ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CONTEXT
1.
Antigua and Barbuda’s economy is experiencing its worst recession in decades.
The global slowdown has severely affected Antigua and Barbuda’s economy through its
impact on tourist arrivals, FDI inflows and remittances, and fiscal revenue. Real GDP
contracted by 7 percent in 2009 after expanding on average by about 6 percent during the
previous 5 years (Figure 1 and Table 1). Following a spike in 2008, inflation has remained in
the low single digits despite a 20 percent increase in fuel prices and higher consumption
taxes. The recession and associated fiscal crisis coincides with mounting problems in the
financial sector—the collapse of the Stanford Group (the largest private conglomerate) and of
the Trinidad-based CL Financial Group. Locally incorporated banks with large exposure to
the government have experienced a decline in deposits, which stabilized toward the end of
the year.
2.
Following many years of accumulation of arrears to domestic and external
creditors, the fiscal situation turned critical in 2009 as the recession led to a 20 percent
decline in tax revenue.1 Meanwhile, recorded primary expenditure rose by 4½ percent of
GDP due to higher-than-budgeted current outlays as well as improved coverage of
outstanding payments (Figure 2 and Tables 2 and 3). The overall fiscal deficit widened from
6 percent of GDP in 2008 to about 19 percent in 2009.2 With limited financing options, the
government accumulated arrears amounting to about 9 percent of GDP to domestic and
external creditors, bringing the total stock of arrears to about 53 percent of GDP, or
45 percent of the outstanding public debt. To begin to address the deterioration in the fiscal
position, the authorities implemented revenue measures in mid-2009 amounting to about
1½ percent of GDP on an annualized basis. These included raising petroleum product prices
in August, by an average of 20 percent (about 1½ percent of GDP), while introducing a
flexible and market-based
petroleum-product pricing
mechanism.

5.
Since its independence in 1981, Antigua and Barbuda has enjoyed a stable
political environment in the context of a parliamentary democracy. Following many
years of delays in the adoption of measures recommended by the Fund, important and broadbased tax reforms were implemented prior to the onset of the global crisis, including the
introduction of a personal income tax, the adoption of the Antigua and Barbuda Sales Tax
(ABST) in January 2007, and the (unsuccessful) attempt to reduce the wage bill through
voluntary separation. Meanwhile, outlays on infrastructure for the cricket World Cup pushed
up expenditures. At the conclusion of 2007 Article IV Consultation, Directors recommended
additional measures to strengthen the fiscal position, but in the face of a spike in food and
fuel prices in 2008, followed by a sharp contraction in economic activity, expenditure
increased while revenue fell sharply. Progress on implementing recommendations to reduce
vulnerabilities in the financial sector and to strengthen competiveness was also curtailed by
the global financial crisis. Following tightly contested elections in April 2009, political
tensions remained relatively high, reflecting the difficult economic situation and the
government’s announcements of a number of adjustment measures. However, the economic
team, under the leadership of the recently appointed finance minister, seemed to have
succeeded in their outreach efforts, which have strengthened domestic support for the
government’s economic program and decision to approach the Fund for financial support.

6

Box 1: Antigua and Barbuda—Banking Sector
Antigua and Barbuda’s banking sector is the second largest among ECCU members,
accounting for about one fifth of the region’s deposits, assets, and loans. It comprises
eight financial institutions: four locally incorporated (“indigenous”) and four branches of
foreign-owned banks. These two groups have broadly equal shares of assets, deposits, and
loans, but their exposures to the public sector are strikingly different: as of end-2009, more
than 90 percent of the total credit to the public sector was provided by indigenous banks,
while the public sector credit accounted for about one third of indigenous banks’ loans.
The collapse of the Stanford Group in February last year led to a significant
withdrawal of deposits from its locally incorporated subsidiary. The Bank of Antigua
suffered a classic bank run following allegations that the offshore institution was involved
in an international Ponzi scheme. The failure of the Bank of Antigua threatened the stability
of the domestic banking and financial system, and by extension that of the ECCU because
of its participation in the clearing and settlement system of the currency union. To prevent
the systemic threat, the ECCB assumed control of the Bank of Antigua, which remains
under management by a consortium of regional banks and the Government of Antigua
and Barbuda (GoAB). To cover the deposit outflow, the ECCB provided a 3-year loan to
the GoAB (amounting to three percent of GDP), which represents Antigua’s contribution
to the recapitalization of the bank.
The scope for restructuring public debt with domestic banks is limited, and financial
sector reform is paramount. The authorities have reported progress on bilateral
discussions with indigenous banks towards agreements that would enhance the liquidity in
the system while providing savings to the government. The authorities are also committed
to strengthening bank supervision through on-site examination of domestic banks, and to
enhance the regulation of domestic nonbanks and offshore financial institutions, with the
support of the ECCB and CARTAC.

7

II. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
6.
The discussions focused on policies aimed at eliminating the arrears on the
public debt, restoring fiscal and external sustainability, and reducing financial sector
vulnerabilities. There was agreement that, to place the public debt on a steady downward
trajectory, the adjustment effort initiated in 2009 would have to be complemented by
additional measures aimed at sharply reducing the budget deficit in 2010 and moving to a
broadly balanced fiscal position in 2011–12. As additional fiscal measures alone cannot
realistically achieve this outcome, it will be necessary for Antigua and Barbuda to seek debt
relief from its domestic and external creditors. In parallel, the authorities indicated that they
would undertake structural reforms with a view to supporting the fiscal adjustment effort and
addressing vulnerabilities in the financial sector. In support of their policy framework, they
are requesting Fund financial assistance in the context of a three-year Stand-By Arrangement
(Section IV and Attachment I).
A. Fiscal Adjustment
7.
In the 2010 budget approved last December, the authorities have continued to
move decisively to reverse the sharp deterioration in the fiscal position. Further to the
measures adopted in mid 2009 described above, they implemented revenue measures
amounting to about 4½ percent of GDP, which would return the tax to GDP ratio close to the
level achieved in the pre-crisis period. These include broadening of the base of the Antigua
and Barbuda Sales Tax (VAT), increasing import duties, and introducing an excise tax on
alcoholic beverages and tobacco (text table). On the expenditure side, the adopted measures
comprise mainly a better prioritization of capital expenditure, implying savings of 8 percent
of GDP in relation to the 2009 outturn. These measures, together with a 2 percent of GDP
increase in grants (from Japan and the European Union), are expected to lead to a sharp
turnaround in the primary fiscal balance, by about 14½ percentage points of GDP in 2010,
implying a primary surplus of 3 percent of GDP this year.

8.
In 2011–12, the primary surplus would be strengthened by a further one percent
of GDP, through improved tax administration and further efficiencies on the
expenditure side of the budget, including through civil service reform. The authorities
envisage a 10 percent reduction in the government’s wage bill by 2012 in relation to the
budgeted 2010 level, which would reflect a freeze in wages and improvements in efficiency
of the civil service as its employment and wage structure are rationalized. The authorities are
also contemplating a broad-based public expenditure reform in line with FAD
recommendations.3
B. Debt Restructuring
9.
There was agreement between the authorities and staff that Antigua and
Barbuda’s public debt would likely remain unsustainable even in the presence of strong
fiscal adjustment measures being implemented. In the absence of a comprehensive debt
restructuring, the public debt-to-GDP ratio would remain at a very high level, leaving the
economy extremely vulnerable to external shocks (Box 2 and Tables 6 and 7). Moreover,
very high levels of arrears would still need to be regularized. Accordingly, the authorities
have begun discussions with their creditors on a comprehensive restructuring of both
domestic and external debt, aimed at placing the public debt on a firmly declining trajectory.
10.
The goal of the debt restructuring is to reduce the government’s interest bill to
4½ percent of GDP in 2010, from a passive projection of 9 percent. The government has
already negotiated a voluntary restructuring of a significant portion of the domestic debt held
by commercial banks, lengthening maturity to 20 years (from an average of 5 years) and
cutting interest rates to 8 percent (from an average of 13 percent). Meanwhile, the
restructuring of debt to statutory corporations is expected to deliver substantial savings—the
authorities’ proposal is to issue a long-term instrument to the statutory bodies, with step-up
interest rates starting at zero during the first 5 years and rising to 5 percent over the life of the
bond. On the external debt front, the authorities have also negotiated a lengthening of the
maturity and a small reduction in interest rates with a major commercial creditor. These
operations have been incorporated in the baseline. The authorities are also seeking relief from
bilateral official creditors within the context of the Paris Club, while arrears with multilateral
financial institutions have either been cleared or agreement on their clearance has been
reached.

An in depth FAD public expenditure TA mission, which visited Antigua in April 2010, has made
recommendations for improving the efficiency of outlays on education, health, and social safety nets.

9

Box 2. Antigua and Barbuda: Debt Sustainability Analysis
Debt sustainability analysis (DSA) indicates that Antigua and Barbuda’s public debt totaling
115 percent of GDP would remain unsustainable even in the presence of the strong fiscal
adjustment measures included in the authorities’ program. The comprehensive debt restructuring
currently underway is therefore necessary to achieve a sustainable fiscal position.


The point of departure for the analysis is the target in the 2010 budget of a primary
surplus of 3 percent of GDP, which implies an overall fiscal deficit of 2½ percent of GDP
in 2010. It is further assumed that, over the medium term, public sector reforms, and in
particular civil service reform would further raise the primary surplus to 4 percent of GDP by
2012. Real GDP would decline by a further 2 percent in 2010, but then would begin to recover
slowly, reaching 4 over the medium term—reflecting inter alia, a recovery in tourism and
benefits from structural reform. While exports of goods would remain flat as a percentage of
GDP, tourism receipts would rise in the context of an increase in tourism-related FDI inflows.
Regarding new financing for the public sector, the analysis assumes a mix of domestic and
external disbursements, both in the form of six-year bonds, at an initial interest rate of
7½ percent, with increments of 50 basis points each year over the medium term. However, even
with these fiscal measures and structural reforms, the debt-to-GDP ratio would not decline
from currently high levels without a comprehensive debt restructuring.



The authorities’ debt restructuring strategy is aimed at regularizing the extremely high
level of external and domestic arrears, and achieving interest savings of about 4½ percent
of GDP. This, in combination with the fiscal adjustment measures, would balance the budget
by 2012 and place the public debt on a firmly declining path.



The domestic debt restructuring will fall heavily on the social security scheme. Being a
relatively new pay-as-you-go scheme the social security system still presents a favorable
dependency ratio, but recent actuarial analysis indicates that it could exhaust its reserves by
2030. The authorities are already considering reforms to the system, including extending the
retirement age and raising the threshold for contributions to ensure its long-term sustainability.



While divestment proceeds are not incorporated into the analysis due to high uncertainty,
the authorities plan to privatize a number of public enterprises. This could contribute to
further debt reduction as well as guard against potential failure to achieve the envisaged debt
relief and/or fiscal costs related to resolution of insurance companies.



Significant vulnerabilities will persist given the still high public debt ratio. Antigua and
Barbuda is susceptible to external shocks and natural disasters. Commodity price shocks,
coupled with the global downturn and problems in the domestic financial sector have reduced
growth and worsened the fiscal position during the last two years. Possible contingent liabilities
from the CL Financial subsidiaries could also raise the path of public debt-to-GDP ratio. These
vulnerabilities strengthen the case for strong upfront fiscal adjustment and substantial savings
from the debt restructuring.

10

C. Structural and Social Policies
11.
The authorities’ policy framework incorporates structural reforms aimed at
strengthening the budget and addressing financial sector vulnerabilities. The highlights
are:


Strengthening revenue agencies. On the revenue front, the authorities are working
with CARTAC to develop a DFID-financed reform program for strengthening
capacity at the Customs and Inland Revenue Department.



Expenditure reforms. Regarding expenditure, the authorities have approached the
World Bank to begin the design of a civil service reform.



Social security reform. In addition, social security reforms are underway (including
raising the retirement age, and increasing the threshold for contributions), which
would help ensure its long-run sustainability.



Public financial management. To prevent further accumulation of expenditure
arrears, the authorities implemented in January 2010 a system for controlling the
expenditure commitments by line ministries, which requires approval by the
Ministry of Finance for all expenditures. Further reforms include improving financial
reporting and auditing by line ministries ahead of the 2011 budget year, as well as
establishing a single treasury account over the medium term.

12.
Strengthening the banking system remains an urgent priority. The authorities
will, in collaboration with the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB), strengthen bank
supervision through on-site examination of domestic banks. In this connection, the
indigenous banks are highly exposed to the government (see Figure 3), and it is therefore
important to ensure that they remain liquid and profitable following the voluntary debt
restructuring agreed with the government. The authorities and the ECCB will continue to
monitor banking system indicators closely.
13.
The authorities are receiving assistance from CARTAC to strengthen the
Financial Sector Regulatory Commission (FSRC), which is responsible for the offshore
financial sector and domestic nonbanks. This would help to avoid the regulatory arbitrage
that created recent problems with the Stanford International Bank and in the insurance sector.
Specifically, the authorities will expedite pending legislation to transform the FSRC into a
single regulatory unit for offshore banks and nonbanks, in line with regional agreements and
international best practice, while providing adequate resources to staff the institution
effectively. In the offshore sector, the government will pass the remaining amendments
needed to effectively combat money laundering and the financing of terrorism. In this
connection, Antigua and Barbuda has signed 13 tax information exchange agreements
(TIEA), one more than the required 12. The authorities are also hosting a regional conference
in June 2010, to reassess the costs and benefits of offshore financial sector activities.

11
14.
The authorities are also committed to resolving the CL Financial insurance
subsidiaries and the Bank of Antigua. The authorities intend to continue to participate
actively in regional efforts to develop a strategy for resolving the problems in the insurance
sector that avoids systemic contagion, minimizes the fiscal costs, and is equitable to all
stakeholders. Antigua’s share of the possible resolution of the British American Insurance
Company (BAICO) is estimated at EC$55 million (1¾ percent of GDP) (text table). The
recapitalization of the Bank of Antigua, over which the ECCB assumed control pursuant to
the 1993 Banking Act, will be completed by June 2010. The government’s contribution
(EC$89 million), which corresponds to the amount borrowed from the ECCB to stem the
outflow of deposits last year, is already incorporated in the public debt.

Regarding social policies, the authorities attach high importance to protecting
social spending. Under the government’s National Economic and Social Transformation
(NEST) plan, social outlays for the most vulnerable will be protected, in particular the school
meals program and allowances for the elderly. In addition, the government plans to create
unemployment benefits and many basic commodities will continue to be exempted from the
Antigua and Barbuda Sales Tax (ABST). The authorities are also committed to enhancing the
targeting and improving the coordination of a variety of social protection programs.
D. Exchange Rate Assessment
16.
The exchange rate of the East Caribbean dollar, which is pegged to the
U.S. dollar, appears to be broadly consistent with Antigua and Barbuda’s economic
fundamentals, assuming full implementation of the reform (Box 3 and Figure 4). Over
the medium term, strong fiscal consolidation is necessary to maintain the equilibrium REER
at a level consistent with fundamentals. In the context of the quasi-currency board, greater
wage and price flexibility would help facilitate the adjustment and limit the contraction of
economic activity and employment.

Box 3. Exchange Rate Assessment and Competitiveness
Antigua and Barbuda’s exchange rate will remain broadly in line with equilibrium based on the
macroeconomic fundamentals and assuming full implementation of reform measures. First, the
equilibrium real exchange rate approach indicates a small undervaluation of about 6 percent in 2009, which
nonetheless lies within the 95 percent confidence interval. The real exchange rate has declined over the last
130
couple of years, reflecting the depreciation of the
Antigua and Barbuda
U.S. dollar against major currencies. The equilibrium
120
real exchange rate has also declined, albeit gradually
Actual
during the second half of this decade mainly due to
Equilibrium
110
earlier fiscal consolidation and the continuing
accumulation of net foreign liabilities.
100
Over the medium term, however, the large fiscal
90
adjustment will likely lower the equilibrium REER.
Relatively weaker domestic demand conceivably will
80
1979

1991
need to go hand in hand with some real depreciation
to facilitate this adjustment. Thus, flexibility of both wages and prices will be key.

1997

2003

2009

The macro balance approach, which incorporates the planned fiscal adjustment, suggests that Antigua
and Barbuda’s medium-term current account balance will be broadly at the equilibrium level. Antigua
and Barbuda’s equilibrium current account balance (i.e., current account “norm”) ranges from -16 to -18 percent
of GDP. The lower bound is obtained when the methodology employs parameters from regressions with ECCU
dummy based on a CARICOM-only sample. The norm is close to -18 percent of GDP when the sample is
enlarged to an expanded set of tourism-dependent economies. The medium-term current account deficit (in
2015) of Antigua and Barbuda is projected to be about 16 percent, assuming full implementation of the planned
measures, which appears to be in line with the equilibrium level, and hence suggests little evidence of the real
exchange rate misalignment.
Sustaining medium-term competitiveness depends on upgrading the capacity of the tourism sector. The
gradual depreciation of the real effective exchange rate during the 2000s has improved the attractiveness of
Antigua and Barbuda as a tourist destination, helping to increase the share of tourist arrivals relative to both the
ECCU and other Caribbean economies. Antigua’s competitiveness will also depend on upgrading the
productive capacity of the tourism sector, including improvements in hotel capacity and infrastructure, along
with greater airport capacity. Given that the tourism sector investment will continue to be financed by FDI, the
fiscal and financial sector reforms incorporated in the authorities’ policy framework would be important steps
for ensuring the country’s competitiveness and maintaining FDI inflows over the medium term.

III. MEDIUM-TERM OUTLOOK
17.
The authorities’ policy framework is predicated on the expectation that,
following a projected further decline in economic activity in 2010, growth would resume
in 2011 and pick up to about 4 percent by 2015. The further decline (by -2 percent) in
2010 would occur despite a pick-up in tourism, as FDI-related and public construction would
remain subdued. The recovery thereafter would reflect resumption of some high-end tourism
projects as well as the effect of structural reforms. Inflation is expected to remain in the range
of 2–3 percent over the medium term. The external current account is projected to improve
by 8 percentage points of GDP to a deficit of about 16½ percent of GDP in 2010, reflecting
major fiscal consolidation. Subsequently, the external current account deficit would remain at
about the same level as a ratio of GDP, in line with the weak recovery in FDI. The overall
balance of payments projections suggest that external financing gaps could reach an average
of US$68 million (or 5 percent of GDP) per year during 2010–12. The Caribbean
Development Bank is expected to provide about US$10 million a year. A Fund arrangement
(discussed below) of SDR 81 million would help to fill the financing gap, keeping Antigua
and Barbuda’s imputed reserve levels at the ECCB stable at about 2 months of import cover.
The remaining external financing gap would be covered by external debt restructuring.
18.
The medium-term growth outlook is critically dependent on recovery in the
demand for tourism. The downside risks relate mainly to a weaker-than-anticipated
recovery in Antigua and Barbuda’s key trading partners and slower than projected FDI
inflows. Moreover, the economic downturn has increased macro-financial risks both in
Antigua and Barbuda and in the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union (ECCU) as a whole.
While direct cross-country exposure appears to be modest, there are risks of spillovers to
other ECCU countries due to the fragility of indigenous banks, given in particular the shared
payments system.
IV. REQUEST FOR STAND-BY ARRANGEMENT, RISKS TO THE PROGRAM, AND CAPACITY
TO REPAY THE FUND
19.
In the attached letter of intent and accompanying Memorandum on Economic
and Financial Policies (MEFP), the authorities have outlined a three-year economic
program for 2010–13 in line with the policy framework discussed above, and they are
requesting Fund financial support through a three-year SBA in the amount of
SDR 81 million (600 percent of quota).
Antigua and Barbuda: SBA Access and Phasing
Reflecting the immediate financing needs and
the upfront nature of the adjustment effort, the
SBA would incorporate a larger initial
disbursement (125 percent of quota) on
approval, followed by a fairly evenly phased
access over the three-year period (Table 9).
Program quantitative conditionality would focus
on achieving the targeted fiscal adjustment. An
adjuster for likely expenditure on resolution of
financial sector difficulties is included; staff will
review this adjuster in the context of future
reviews in light of remaining macro-financial risks that stem from the unresolved companies

in the insurance sector, the fragility of the banking system and spillovers from financial
sector in other ECCU economies. Quantitative and structural conditionality is specified in
Tables 1–2 of the MEFP and discussed in Box 3 and the Technical Memorandum of
Understanding (Attachment II). In the event that a projected shortfall emerges relative to the
fiscal targets and/or programmed interest savings from restructuring, the government will
take contingency measures and, in this context, the yield from consumption tax on fuel would
be reviewed. The program would be monitored on the basis of quarterly reviews, the first of
which would be completed by September 2010. The staff will assess the possible need to
activate contingency measures at the time of the first review.
20.
The program is consistent with the Fund’s policies on arrears. The authorities are
pursuing a debt restructuring strategy that emphasizes information transparency, intercreditor equity, and dialogue with all creditor groups. Staff is of the view that there are
reasonable expectations that a restructuring of the public debt consistent with Antigua’s
payments capacity is possible. Staff has received financing assurances from the Paris Club to
address Antigua’s public debt arrears and liquidity under the Evian approach. In addition, the
government has reached understandings on the clearance of its remaining arrears with
multilateral creditors. With the assistance of their external debt advisors, the authorities have
contacted all of their external creditors and have either initiated active negotiations or plan to
engage them (MEFP # 7). As noted earlier, agreement has already been reached with a major
external commercial creditor.
21.
This financial support from Antigua’s creditors is essential for closing the
residual financing gaps. The external financing requirement in 2010 is expected to be filled
by IMF disbursements under the proposed SBA (SDR 24 million or US$36 million), by a
policy based loan from the Caribbean Development Bank (US$10 million), with a residual
financing gap of US$25 million that is programmed to be filled by further debt restructuring
(Table 8).4
22.
The proposed program entails substantial risks. These are associated mainly with
the magnitude of the targeted fiscal adjustment. While the authorities have demonstrated a
high degree of policy ownership—including by announcing their policies to the public in a
timely and comprehensive fashion—and the bulk of the adjustment measures have already
been implemented upfront, the yield of some measures is subject to uncertainty and the
domestic political support needed to sustain them over three years would be considerable. In
addition, weaknesses in implementation capacity might hamper progress with both fiscal
adjustment and structural reforms. However, preliminary indicators suggest that the fiscal
performance during the first quarter of the year was slightly better than the baseline
projections.

4

The residual gap takes into account restructuring already underway (see paragraph 10). For purposes of the
DSA, the residual gap is assumed to be financed by new commercial borrowing.

15

Box 4. Structural Program
The authorities’ policy framework will be supported by structural reforms aimed at
strengthening the budget and addressing financial sector vulnerabilities. The fiscal reforms
target strengthening of revenue agencies, containing expenditure growth, and enhancing
public financial management. These reforms will underpin the strengthening of the budget over
the medium term. The financial sector reforms are critical to reducing vulnerabilities and
minimizing macro-fiscal risks associated with the fragile banking system and uneven
regulation of non-bank financial institutions.
Strengthening revenue agencies. Reforms in Customs and Inland Revenue departments will
be initially targeted at improving the information technology infrastructure and enhancing
human resources, followed by legislation to strengthen the agencies and increase compliance.
In this regard, legislation will be presented to harmonize tax laws, establish a revenue court,
and close loopholes in duty-free shopping toward the end of 2010.
Reducing expenditures. The World Bank is expected to provide recommendations on the
rationalization of the civil service, as well as the results of a government compensation survey
in June 2010. These will be integrated into the government’s Civil Service Transformation
Program, which involves reducing the workforce through attrition, reviewing the compensation
and functions of civil servants, and outsourcing some government activities.
Enhancing public financial management (PFM). A critical element of PFM reform, which is
aimed at preventing the recurrence of extremely high expenditure arrears, enhancing financial
reporting and increasing fiscal transparency, is the full implementation of the Finance
Administration Act. Regulations for the act are expected to be issued by end-June and would
enhance financial accountability and controls. Other measures include improving financial
reporting and auditing by line ministries and establishing a single treasury account.
Strengthening Social Security finances. The authorities are developing a set of proposals for
parametric reform of the social security that will raise the retirement age progressively from
60 to 65, and increase the maximum income for contributions. The authorities expect to initiate
these reforms by end-December 2010. The proposals for the reform of the social security
scheme will be finalized in the context of the ongoing actuarial review and will be discussed
further during the first review.
Reducing banking system vulnerabilities. The benchmarks in this area are within the
competence of the ECCB and seek to reduce systemic risks by obtaining a clear picture of
banking system vulnerabilities and enhancing the capital of fragile banks.
Enhancing the regulation and supervision of nonbanks. The main goal of reforms is to
reduce regulatory arbitrage through convergence with international best practice, thereby
minimizing the potential fiscal cost of financial sector difficulties. The benchmarks focus on
implementing legislation for regulation of nonbanks, the offshore sector, and AML-CFT.

16

23.
Full implementation of the program would place Antigua and Barbuda in a
position to discharge its obligations to the Fund in a timely manner. Antigua and
Barbuda has no outstanding credit with the Fund (Table 10). Debt service to the Fund will
comprise an annual average of 22 percent of total external debt service obligations,
equivalent to 3 percent of exports of goods and services. The IMF debt to GDP would peak at
9 percent of GDP in 2013 before declining gradually over the medium term. A safeguards
assessment of the ECCB was conducted in 2007, concluding that adequate safeguards were
in place to manage resources, including IMF disbursements. The assessment determined low
risk ratings in all ELRIC areas.
24.
Important debt-related vulnerabilities remain as the public debt would still be
high even assuming a comprehensive debt restructuring. There is some bunching of debt
service payments during 2014–16 when Fund repayments are due. More generally, Antigua
and Barbuda is exposed to external shocks, the aforementioned macro-financial risks, and
weather-related vulnerabilities. However, the ECCB’s reserves, which currently stand at
US$800 million are projected to increase to US$825 million over the medium term and
Antigua’s participation in the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility (CCRIF)
provides insurance cover to reduce the fiscal costs associated with natural disasters.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
25.
Antigua and Barbuda’s economy has been hard-hit by large exogenous shocks to
tourism, tourism-related FDI inflows, and remittances. These shocks have led to a
marked decline in economic activity, weakened the balance of payments, and exacerbated an
unsustainable fiscal position resulting from longstanding fiscal imbalances and an
unmanageable stock of domestic and external arrears. The weak public finances, in turn, pose
a serious threat to the prospects for a resumption of sustained economic growth and return to
external stability. The authorities are therefore to be commended for their three-pronged
approach to restoring fiscal and debt sustainability, which comprises front-loaded adjustment
measures, debt restructuring to eliminate arrears and provide for interest flow relief, and
structural reforms to further strengthen the fiscal position and to address financial sector
vulnerabilities.
26.
The authorities have demonstrated a welcome commitment to a strong fiscal
adjustment program, which—if sustained—will constitute a decisive step towards
restoring debt sustainability. Following the substantial measures taken in mid 2009,
including the introduction of a flexible and market-based petroleum product pricing
mechanism, they have adopted in the 2010 budget additional measures that are expected to
shift the primary balance into a significant surplus, following a primary deficit of
11½ percent of GDP in 2009. These measures include prioritizing capital expenditure and
containing the wage bill and spending on goods and services, complemented by revenue
measures aimed at returning the tax-to-GDP ratio to pre-crisis levels. Given the magnitude of
the targeted adjustments, the successful implementation of their policy framework will
require the authorities’ continued full and unequivocal commitment.
27.
Notwithstanding the strength of the targeted primary fiscal adjustment, the
comprehensive public debt restructuring sought by the authorities is also paramount
for achieving debt sustainability. The authorities have taken welcome first steps as part of
the process of developing and implementing a comprehensive public debt restructuring

17

strategy during the second half of 2010. Given the structure of the debt, and that the bulk of the
interest relief will come from restructuring the domestic debt, the parametric reform envisaged by
the authorities for the social security scheme—a key domestic creditor—will be needed to ensure
its long-term viability. To complement domestic fiscal and debt restructuring effort, it is
appropriate that external creditors have also been called upon to help with the burden sharing
through a restructuring of the external debt. Staff therefore supports the authorities’ efforts to
engage in open, transparent negotiations with external creditors on a restructuring aimed at
restoring public debt sustainability, consistent with Antigua and Barbuda’s long-term repayment
capacity.
28.
Over the medium term, the fiscal structural reforms planned by the authorities will
play a central role in their efforts to further strengthen the fiscal position. These include a
needed strengthening of the revenue collection agencies, long overdue public financial
management reforms, a highly timely rationalization of the civil service, and much needed
improvements in the efficiency of other public spending, inter alia through better prioritization of
investment projects. Such reforms are expected to further strengthen the primary balance and,
together with the interest savings from debt restructuring, enable Antigua and Barbuda to achieve
overall budget balance by 2012. This fiscal trajectory would not only help to place the public
debt-to GDP ratio on a firmly declining path, but also guard against the possibility that the cost of
resolving financial sector institutions turns out to be higher than expected.
29.
The program’s financial sector reform agenda is well-focused, addressing weaknesses
in both bank and nonbank segments. Onsite inspection by the ECCB will provide important
information on the status of the banking system and form the basis for addressing fragilities of
domestic banks in a timely manner. Meanwhile, strengthening of the regulatory and prudential
framework for offshore financial services and nonbanks will address major weaknesses, as
evidenced by the recent collapse of the Stanford International Bank and the problems in the
insurance sector. The authorities’ intention to participate actively in regional efforts to resolve the
CLICO insurance subsidiaries is also welcome.
30.
Given their strong and comprehensive policy framework for restoring debt
sustainability, and despite considerable risks, the authorities’ proposed program merits
Fund support through the requested SBA. The arrangement would provide a framework for the
needed adjustment and financing, including by helping restore confidence of foreign private
investors and external creditors. The proposed access level reflects the large financing needs and
takes into account the strong upfront adjustment effort and reform agenda. The staff is of the view
that the authorities are in compliance with the Fund’s policies on arrears, based on their good faith
efforts to engage with external creditors and commitment to clear all arrears to multilaterals.
31.
The statistical information provided by Antigua and Barbuda is broadly adequate for
Fund surveillance but important areas for improvement remain. In particular, while
preliminary monthly data on public expenditure and revenue have recently begun to be produced
by the authorities, the new reporting system is as yet untested. The authorities are encouraged to
improve the quality and timeliness of data provision, including possibly through technical
assistance from CARTAC.
It is expected that the next Article IV consultation with Antigua and Barbuda will be held in
accordance with Decision No. 12794–(02/76), as amended.

Annex I. Antigua and Barbuda: Summary of Appendices
Fund Relations
Antigua and Barbuda does not have outstanding obligations to the Fund. The last Article IV
consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on February 4, 2008 (IMF Country
Report No. 08/225). Several missions from the Caribbean Regional Technical Assistance
Centre (CARTAC) and the Fiscal Affairs Department (FAD) have visited Antigua and
Barbuda since the beginning of 2006 to assist the authorities in strengthening revenue
collection.
Antigua and Barbuda is a member of the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB), which
manages monetary policy and the exchange system for its eight members. The common
currency, the Eastern Caribbean dollar, has been pegged to the U.S. dollar at the rate of
EC$2.70 per U.S. dollar since July 1976. Antigua and Barbuda has accepted the obligations
of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on
the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions.
Relations with the World Bank Group
The World Bank Board discussed the Eastern Caribbean Sub-Region Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS) for FY 2010–14 on June 3, 2010. The four-year CAS aims to support the
sub-region’s development agenda through two main pillars: (i) building resilience to
exogenous shocks; (ii) enhancing competitiveness and stimulating growth to help reduce
poverty. Antigua and Barbuda has recently received two World Bank technical assistance
grants to assist with its public sector transformation plan and environmental protection. The
IFC is also assisting the government with its public sector divestment program.
Relations with the Caribbean Development Bank
The CDB supports the economic and social development of Antigua and Barbuda through
policy dialogue and the financing of priority capital projects and technical assistance. As of
December 31, 2009, CDB has approved loans totalling US$71.8 million, of which
US$7.4 million are undisbursed. In December 2009, the CDB Board of Directors approved a
US$30 million policy based loan to be disbursed over three years pending approval of an
IMF program.
Statistical Issues
Antigua and Barbuda participates in the Fund’s General Data Dissemination System
(GDDS). Data provided to the Fund are broadly adequate for surveillance purposes but some
weaknesses remain, particularly in the real sector (including the consumer price index), fiscal
and balance of payments data. An April 2007 data ROSC mission assessing monetary and
financial statistics noted some recent improvements and identified some shortcomings in the
ECCB’s monetary statistics, which a technical assistance mission in December 2009 was
aimed at addressing.

Annex II
May 21, 2010
Mr. Dominique Strauss-Kahn
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, N.W.
Washington, D.C. 20431
Dear Mr. Strauss-Kahn:
The Government of Antigua and Barbuda is addressing decisively the most severe fiscal and
balance of payments crisis in the history of the country. The global financial turmoil that
started in late 2008 has compounded decades of severe fiscal imbalances and drastically
reduced tourism receipts, FDI inflows and remittances. The Antiguan and Barbudan
economy experienced a 7 percent contraction in 2009 and a further decline of 2 percent is
expected in 2010. The strains from the global liquidity crunch also precipitated the collapse
of two large private financial conglomerates with significant presence in Antigua and
Barbuda. The resulting decline in employment and economic activity has magnified the
deterioration in the fiscal position and increase in public debt and arrears. Together, these
developments threaten to seriously undermine the macroeconomic prospects of our country,
with potential systemic implications to the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union.
In support of its strong and comprehensive program for 2010–12, aimed at restoring fiscal
and external sustainability, the Government of Antigua and Barbuda is seeking the support of
the International Monetary Fund through a three-year Stand-By Arrangement in the amount
of SDR 81 million, equivalent to 600 percent of our quota. The program, which is described
in the attached memorandum of economic and financial policies (MEFP), includes
expenditure cuts and revenue measures amounting to about 13 percent of GDP in 2010 and
also incorporates important structural reforms that will further enhance the fiscal position in
2011–12 while reducing vulnerabilities in the financial sector. Two of the structural
benchmarks entail actions on the part of the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank, which has
provided the government with assurances that such actions will be taken in a timely manner
(see attached letter). As a key pillar of our effort towards fiscal sustainability, we have
initiated discussions with our domestic and external creditors with the goal of reaching
agreement on a restructuring of our debt that enables us to eliminate arrears and sharply
reduce the debt service burden.

34
We believe that the economic and financial policies set forth in the MEFP are sufficient to
ensure that the objectives of the 2010–12 program will be met. However, if needed, we stand
ready to take any further measures that may prove necessary to meet our objectives, and
would consult with the IMF on the adoption of such measures, and in advance of revisions to
the policies contained in the MEFP, in accordance with the Fund’s policies on such
consultations. In addition, the Government of Antigua and Barbuda does not intend to
impose new or intensify existing restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for
current international transactions, introduce new or intensify existing trade restrictions for
balance of payments purposes, or enter into bilateral payments agreements which are
inconsistent with Article VIII of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement.
Sincerely yours,

/s/
Hon. Harold Lovell
Minister of Finance, the Economy and Public Administration
Antigua and Barbuda

Attachment 1
MEMORANDUM ON ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL POLICIES, 2010–13
May 24, 2010
I. BACKGROUND
1.

Following many years of protracted fiscal imbalances, the current global economic

and financial crisis has severely affected Antigua and Barbuda’s economy, given our
dependence on tourism, foreign direct investment (FDI), and remittances from abroad, all of
which have declined in the difficult external environment. Economic activity contracted by
7 percent in 2009 and is projected to decline by a further 2 percent in 2010. This has
contributed to further severe pressures on our fiscal and balance of payments positions.
Inflation has remained low despite higher fuel prices and consumption taxes, reflecting lower
international food prices.
2.

The crisis has taken a major toll on our already fragile public finances, notably in the

form of a roughly 20 percent drop in fiscal revenue last year. To help stem the deterioration
in the fiscal position, we introduced a flexible fuel pricing mechanism in August last year to
better align retail prices with import costs while raising the consumption tax on fuel and
cutting current expenditure in relation to budgeted levels by the equivalent of 3½ percent of
GDP. Notwithstanding these measures, the primary fiscal deficit reached 11½ percent of
GDP in 2009, which—given interest obligations (including interest on arrears)—resulted in
an overall fiscal deficit of 19 percent of GDP, more than three times the overall fiscal deficit
to GDP recorded in 2008. 1 Given the limited available financing, the government
accumulated further arrears amounting to about 9 percent of GDP in 2009 to domestic and
foreign creditors. As a result, the total stock of arrears (including interest arrears) reached
53 percent of GDP.

1

Interest obligations include contractual interest of about EC$90 million and interest on outstanding stock of
arrears EC$155 million.

36
3.

On the external front, tourism receipts, which account for about one-half of exports of

goods and services, contracted by more than 15 percent in 2009. However, the external
current account deficit—though still very high—narrowed to 25 percent of GDP, as lower
international food and fuel prices, as well as the fall in FDI related imports, contributed to a
reduced import bill. The overall deficit in the balance of payments was financed mainly by a
decline in Antigua and Barbuda’s net international reserves, a drawdown of commercial
banks’ net foreign assets, and the above-noted further build up of external arrears.
II. PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES
4.

The main objectives of the program will be to stabilize the public finances in 2010

and to entrench a downward trend for the public debt ratio in subsequent years. In 2010, we
intend to deepen our fiscal adjustment process and to normalize Antigua and Barbuda’s
relations with its domestic and external creditors, thereby setting the stage for restored fiscal
and external sustainability and revival of private investment—as is essential for achieving
higher and sustainable growth. The government has already embarked on a major effort at
strengthening budgetary performance, which will be intensified in the period ahead.
Concurrently, the government is actively seeking debt relief from Antigua and Barbuda’s
domestic and external creditors. These efforts will be accompanied by supporting structural
reforms in the public and financial sectors.
A. Fiscal Adjustment
5.

The fiscal measures adopted for the 2010 budget are unprecedented in their

magnitude and—along with the debt restructuring discussed below—will provide the critical
mass of adjustment that must be put in place to restore debt sustainability. The revenue
measures comprise broadening of the base of the Antigua and Barbuda Sales Tax (VAT),
increasing import duties, and introducing an excise tax on alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The combined yield of these measures is projected at 4½ percent of GDP in relation to the
2009 outturn. On the expenditure side, the government will cut capital expenditure while
protecting high-priority investment projects, and it will also reduce spending on goods and
services by improving efficiencies, with a combined yield of 8 percent of GDP in relation to
the 2009 outturn. Accordingly, we are targeting for 2010 a sharp improvement in the primary

37
fiscal balance, to a surplus equivalent to about 3 percent of GDP. In the event that a projected
shortfall emerges relative to this target, the government will take contingency measures and,
in this context, the yield from consumption tax on fuel would be reviewed. Similarly excess
revenue would be saved or applied to arrears reduction should revenue exceed the baseline
projections. In the second and third years of the program, the government will achieve
further efficiencies on the expenditure side of the budget, including through civil service
reform, which are expected to further increase the primary surplus by about 1 percent of GDP
by 2012.
B. Debt Restructuring
6.

While the bold actions outlined above would bring about, on a flow basis, a sharp

improvement in the fiscal accounts, they would not in themselves provide a resolution for the
very high stock of arrears. Moreover, the public sector debt would remain at dangerously
elevated levels over the medium- and long-term. Accordingly, the government is in the
process of eliminating the stock of arrears (presently, 53 percent of GDP) through a
negotiated restructuring of the public debt. We expect that such a restructuring will be
consistent with a reduction in the annual interest bill by about one-half, to about 4 percent of
GDP during the program period. As a result, the projected overall fiscal deficits would be
very small—about 1½ percent of GDP in 2010, ½ percent of GDP in 2011, and a roughly
balanced fiscal position by 2012—as is necessary to place the public debt ratio on a firmly
declining path.
7.

Towards these objectives, and as we have communicated to the public, the

government is seeking to restructure about 80 percent of the public debt, and has solicited the
support of our creditors. With the assistance of debt advisors, we have developed a debt
restructuring strategy emphasizing information transparency, inter-creditor equity, and
dialogue with all creditor groups. Immediate cash flow relief, sustained reduction of our debt
service burden, and significant balance of payments support from our international partners
will be necessary. The government has reached understandings on the clearance of its
remaining arrears with multilateral creditors. Moreover, we have approached official bilateral
creditors with whom we have arrears seeking agreement on an arrears clearance strategy.
With regard to domestic debt, we will ensure that the debt restructuring is consistent with the

38
continued stability of our banking system, which has a large portion of its assets in
government debt. The provision of much needed debt restructuring from the statutory
corporations will be accompanied by reforms that will ensure their long-term sustainability.
C. Macroeconomic Framework
8.

Regarding the overall macroeconomic framework, the key variables underpinning the

fiscal targets specified above are a further contraction in economic activity, by about
2 percent in 2010, followed by a small recovery in 2011 and a positive real growth of about
2.5 percent in 2012; and annual inflation in the range of 2 percent. Given this scenario, the
fiscal stance is consistent with a reduction in the external current account deficit to about
16 percent of GDP by 2012; and a substantial recovery in Antigua’s net international reserves
to about EC$100 million by 2012. The ratio of gross public sector debt to GDP (in nominal
terms) is projected to decline over the program period, from 115 percent in 2009 to
101 percent by 2013.
D. Structural and Social Policies
9.

The government will take steps in 2010 to enhance public financial management.

This is essential, in particular to ensure that the envisaged deep cuts in low priority spending
are successfully implemented during the program period. To advance this important agenda,
the government will take the following steps in 2010: (i) issue regulations to operationalize
the Finance Administration Act passed by parliament in 2006; (ii) strengthen financial
management, reporting and auditing in line ministries; (iii) strengthen capacity at Customs
and Inland Revenue Departments, including the VAT Unit; (iv) continue to move towards
establishment of a single treasury account; (v) strengthen medium-term macro framework to
help frame annual budgets; and (vi) integrate the current and capital budget processes. In
addition, we have requested Fund technical assistance to improve debt management and the
recording of the public debt.
10.

Civil service and pension reforms are key pillars of the government’s medium-term

strategy. The streamlining of Antigua and Barbuda’s public sector, which began with a
Voluntary Separation and Early-retirement Programme (VSEP) in 2006, will be continued in
the context of the Public Sector Transformation Programme. Specifically, we envisage a

39
20 percent reduction in the government’s wage bill from 2009 to 2012, which would reflect
improvements in efficiency of the civil service as its employment and the wage structure are
rationalized. The government will also introduce social security reforms, by March 2011,
aimed at securing the scheme’s long-term sustainability.
11.

In the financial sector, the issues surrounding the Bank of Antigua (over which the

Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB) assumed control in 2009 pursuant to the ECCB
Agreement Act of 1983), will be resolved by June 2010. We will also strengthen the
Financial Services Regulatory Commission (FSRC), which is responsible for the regulation
of offshore banks and the nonbank financial sector, so as to avoid a recurrence of regulatory
arbitrage episodes, such as with the Stanford International Bank and in the insurance sector.
In particular, the government will pass legislation to establish a single regulatory unit for the
nonbank financial sector by June 2010, and provide resources to adequately staff this
institution. At the same time, the government will pass the remaining amendments needed to
effectively combat money laundering and the financing of terrorism. Moreover, the
government will continue to actively participate in regional efforts to reach a prompt
resolution of the CL Financial subsidiaries with private sector participation.
12.

The government will continue to protect the most vulnerable social groups under a

variety of social programs. These include allowances for the elderly, funding for social
protection projects (school meals and uniform programs), unemployment benefits, and
targeted subsidies for a number of basic commodities.
III. PROGRAM MONITORING AND SAFEGUARDS ASSESSMENT
13.

Progress in the implementation of policies under this program will be monitored

through quarterly reviews and through quantitative performance criteria, with indicative
targets as well as structural benchmarks also defined. The first and second program and
financing assurances reviews would be completed by September 15, 2010, and
December 15, 2010, respectively. At this stage, quantitative performance criteria are set for
end-June and end-September 2010, and quantitative indicative targets are set for
end-December 2010 and end-March 2011. The quantitative performance criteria and
indicative targets are set out in Table 1. Definitions of all relevant variables and reporting

40
requirements are contained in the attached Technical Memorandum of Understanding. The
program also incorporates a continuous performance criterion on the non-accumulation of
domestic and external debt arrears on the public debt. We have provided the Fund with a plan
for the clearance of all arrears, and will provide quarterly reports on the outstanding stock of
all arrears within one month of the end of each quarter. Structural benchmarks are presented
in Table 2.
14.

A safeguards assessment of the ECCB was conducted in 2007 and most of the

recommendations of the assessment have been implemented. The ECCB is on a 4-year
Safeguards Assessment cycle, and the next one is due in 2011.

Hon. Harold Lovell
Minister of Finance, the Economy and Public Administration
Ministry of Finance and Economy
St. John’s
Antigua and Barbuda

Dear Hon. Minister:
Thank you very much for sharing with the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank the draft
Memorandum on Economic and Financial Policies agreed with the mission from the
International Monetary Fund. We fully support the policies outlined therein, which should
contribute greatly to placing Antigua and Barbuda on a sustainable fiscal path, addressing its
balance of payments need, and reducing financial sector vulnerabilities—all of which are
essential requirements for medium- and long-term growth.
The ECCB takes note of the fact that you have proposed in the MEFP two structural
benchmarks—on the recapitalization of the Bank of Antigua and on-site inspection of
domestic commercial banks—that require direct actions on our part. We welcome the
inclusion of these benchmarks and would like to assure you that the ECCB will take the
necessary steps for them to be observed within the time frame specified in Schedule 2 of the
MEFP.
Please feel free to share this letter with the IMF in the context of your request for a Stand-By
Arrangement.
Sincerely yours,

/s/
Sir K. Dwight Venner
Governor

43
Attachment 3
ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA: TECHNICAL MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
1.
Performance under the Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) will be assessed on the basis of
quantitative performance criteria and indicative targets, as well as structural benchmarks.
This Technical Memorandum of Understanding presents the definitions of variables set out in
Table 1 of the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) and the reporting
requirements to adequately monitor performance under the program.
2.
For the purposes of the program, the exchange rate of the East Caribbean dollar
(EC$) to the U.S. dollar is set at EC$2.70 = US$1. Foreign currency accounts denominated in
currencies other than the U.S. dollar, excluding SDRs, will be first valued in the U.S. dollar
at actual end-of-period exchange rates used by the ECCB to calculate the official exchange
rates. SDR-denominated accounts will be valued at the program exchange rate of U.S. dollar
1.5 per SDR.
IV. COVERAGE
3.
For the purpose of the program, the central government will cover all items included
in the government budget.
4.
The nonfinancial public sector is defined as the total central government and
nonfinancial public enterprises. Public enterprises consist of Agricultural Development
Corporation, Antigua and Barbuda Hospitality Training Institute, Antigua and Barbuda
Institute of Continuing Education, Antigua and Barbuda Investment Authority, Antigua and
Barbuda Social Security Board of Control, Antigua Barbuda Airport Authority, Antigua
Barbuda Bureau of Standards Board, Antigua Barbuda Development Bank, Antigua Barbuda
Tourism Authority, Antigua Barbuda Transport Board, Antigua Pier Group Limited, Antigua
Port Authority, Antigua Public Utilities Authority, Board of Education 1994 Limited, Central
Housing and Planning Authority, Central Marketing Corporation, Development Control
Authority, Financial Services Regulatory Commission, Industrial Development Board,
Medical Benefits Scheme, Mt St. John Medical Centre, National Parks Authority, National
Solid Waste Management Authority, PDV Caribe, St John’s Development Corporation,
State Insurance Corporation and Youth Empowerment Corporation.
5.
External debt is defined as all debt owed to creditors residing outside of Antigua and
Barbuda, while domestic debt covers all debt owed to residents of Antigua and Barbuda. All
bonds issued at the Regional Government Securities Market (RGSM) will be regarded as
domestic debt.

44
V. QUANTITATIVE PERFORMANCE CRITERIA
A. Central Government’s Overall Deficit
6.
The central government’s overall balance will cover all its revenue, grants,
expenditure, and transfers. Revenues will exclude any proceeds from the sale of public
assets, which will be considered as financing.
7.
The central government’s overall deficit will be measured from the financing side
as the sum of the net domestic financing plus net external financing.
8.

9.

Net domestic financing of the central government is the sum of:


net domestic bank financing as measured by the change in the domestic
banking system credit to the central government net of deposits, as reported
by the consolidated balance sheet of the monetary authorities and commercial
banks, including special tranches from the ECCB;



net nonbank financing as measured by the net changes in holdings of
government securities by nonbanks, and net borrowing from nonbank
institutions;



the change in the stock of domestic arrears of the central government defined
as net changes in unpaid checks issued, unprocessed claims, pending invoices,
plus accrued interest payments, and other forms of expenditures recorded
above the line but not paid;



gross receipts from divestment are defined as proceeds received from any
privatization/divestment; and



any exceptional financing (including rescheduled principal and interest).

Net external financing of the central government is defined as the sum of:


disbursements of project and non-project loans, including securitization;



proceeds from bonds issued abroad (with an original maturity of one year or
greater;



exceptional financing (including rescheduled principal and interest);



net changes in cash deposits held outside the domestic banking system;



net changes in short-term external debt excluding exceptional financing (with
an original maturity of less than one year);

45


any change in arrears on external interest payments and other forms of
external expenditures recorded above the line but not paid;



payments of principal on current maturities for bonds and loans on a due
basis, including any prepayment of external but excluding repayments to the
IMF.

less:

10.

The ceiling on the overall deficit of the central government will be adjusted:



upward to the extent that grants fall short of the programmed amounts as specified in
Table 1 by more than EC$10 million; and upward by the cumulative amount of up to
EC$25 million spent on bank recapitalization and support to the British American
Insurance Companies—any amounts spent in excess of this programmed contingency
will need to be funded within the program limit on the overall deficit. Grants are
defined as noncompulsory transfers, in cash or in kind, received from other
governments or from international organizations.

Note: Values presented are cumulative.

B. Stock of Central Government Short-Term External Debt
11.
The limit on short-term external debt applies to debt owed or guaranteed by the
central government of Antigua and Barbuda, with an original maturity of up to and including
one year. Excluded from the limit are any rescheduling operations (including the deferral of
interest on commercial debt) and normal import-related credits. Normal import credit is
understood to be a self-liquidating operation where the proceeds from sales of imports are
used to retire the debt. Debt falling within the limit shall be valued in US dollars at the time
the contract or guarantee becomes effective.
C. External Arrears of the Public Sector
12.
The non-accumulation of arrears to external creditors will be a continuous
performance criterion under the program. This performance criterion applies to debt
contracted or guaranteed by central government from multilateral or bilateral official
creditors. External payment arrears consist of external debt service obligations (principal and

46
interest) falling due after December 31, 2009 that have not been paid at the time due, taking
into account the grace periods specified in contractual agreements. Arrears resulting from the
nonpayment of debt service for which a clearance framework has been agreed or a
rescheduling agreement is being sought are excluded from this definition.
D. Budget Expenditure Arrears
13.
A ceiling is set on central government budget expenditure arrears to domestic
private parties, equal to the stock of such arrears as at December 31, 2009 (Table 2). This
ceiling will be monitored on a continuous basis. Budget expenditure arrears are defined as
the sum of: (1) any invoice that has been received by a spending agency from a supplier of
goods, services, and capital goods delivered and verified, and for which payment has not
been made within the contractually agreed period, or, in the absence of a grace period, within
60 days; and (2) unpaid wages, pensions, or transfers, pending for longer than 60 days to
domestic or foreign residents, irrespective of the currency denomination of the obligation.

VI. INDICATIVE TARGET ON THE PRIMARY BALANCE OF THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT
14.
The central government’s primary balance is defined as revenue and grants minus
non-interest expenditures. As in the definition of the overall balance, revenues will exclude
privatization proceeds. Net lending is a non-interest expenditure item (negative net lending is
a revenue item). Interest expenditures include interest payments on outstanding arrears, as
defined above in sections C and D (at their contractual rates) converted to a cash basis.
15.
The floor on the primary balance of the central government will be monitored
from above the line on a cash basis. Transfers among entities of the central government are
mutually offsetting; hence, the difference between the simple sum of revenues and the simple
sum of primary expenditures across all central government entities yields the consolidated
central government balance. Should discrepancies arise, reconciliation between reported
transfers and reported revenues from other central government entities will be required so
that compliance with the central government primary balance target can be assessed.

47
16.
The floor on the primary balance of the central government will be adjusted as
follows:


downward (i.e., a smaller primary surplus target would apply) to the extent that
grants fall short of the programmed amounts as specified in Table 1 by more than
EC$10 million



downward by the cumulative amount of up to EC$ 25 million spent on bank
recapitalization and support to the British American Insurance Companies—any
amounts spent in excess of this programmed contingency will need to be funded
within the program limit on the overall deficit.
VII. DATA AND INFORMATION

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA
External and Public Debt Sustainability Analysis
Prepared by the Staff of the International Monetary Fund
May 25, 2010
This debt sustainability analysis (DSA) indicates that Antigua and Barbuda’s public and
publicly guaranteed (PPG) debt would be unsustainable even in the presence of strong
adjustment measures. The comprehensive debt restructuring, currently underway, is
therefore necessary to achieve a sustainable fiscal position.
A. Introduction
1.
Antigua and Barbuda has one of the highest debt-to-GDP ratios in the
Caribbean. As of end 2009, the PPG debt stock is estimated to be around 115 percent of
GDP.1 About two thirds of Antigua and Barbuda’s PPG debt is held domestically (72 percent
of GDP), mostly by statutory bodies (28 percent of GDP) and commercial banks (22 percent
of GDP). The external debt (44 percent of GDP) is mainly comprised of obligations to
commercial creditors (15 percent of GDP), non-Paris Club bilateral creditors (14 percent of
GDP), and Paris Club members (10 percent of GDP). Antigua’s debt with multilaterals is low
(about 4 percent of GDP), and mainly due to the Caribbean Development Bank and the
European Investment Bank. In 2009, the country had to borrow also from the
Eastern Caribbean Central Bank about 3 percent of GDP to address solvency problems faced
by one of the major domestic banks (Figure 1, Panel A).
2.
The stock of arrears is estimated to be 45 percent of PPG debt (53 percent of
GDP). Most domestic arrears are due to statutory bodies (28 percent of GDP), essentially in
the form of unpaid contributions (Figure 1, Panel B).2 Arrears to domestic suppliers amount
to 6 percent of GDP, while arrears to domestic banks amount to less than one percent of
GDP. At the external level, the bulk of arrears are due to Paris Club members (7 percent of
GDP, mostly on past due interest), non-Paris Club official creditors (5 percent of GDP), and
commercial creditors (5 percent of GDP). The country has also a small portion of arrears
with multilaterals, which will be cleared in the coming months.
1

PPG debt includes central government debt and government guaranteed debt contracted by non-financial
parastatals. The stock data and service projections are provisional and subject to revisions upon reconciliation
with creditors.
2

In late 2007 the arrears with the statutory bodies decreased by EC$104 million (US$38 million) due to a
bilateral agreement between the central government and the Board of Education.

3.
Domestic credit to the government is concentrated on indigenous banks and
statutory bodies. About EC$ 780 million is held by the domestic banking sector, mostly by
indigenous banks and the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank. The debt with statutory bodies
amounts to near EC$ 860 million, as a result of unpaid contributions to the Social Security
Board, the Medical Benefit Scheme, the State Insurance Corporation, and the Board of
Education. The entire stock of outstanding debt with statutory bodies is on arrears.
4.
The exchange rate risk offered by foreign-denominated debt in Antigua and
Barbuda is relatively low. Reflecting the structure of its treasury operations, all domestic
debt is denominated in local currency (Eastern Caribbean dollars). Moreover, about
83 percent of its external debt is denominated in U.S. dollars, to which the local currency has
been pegged since 1976. Recent disbursements by China have—to a limited extent—
contributed to a diversification away from the U.S. dollars and toward the Chinese renminbi
(9 percent of the external debt). The remaining portion of external debt is denominated
mostly in euros (4 percent) and Kuwaiti dinars (3 percent).
5.
The residual maturity of the debt is skewed towards the short-term, as a result
of significant accumulation of arrears and short-term commercial loans. In addition to
the existing stock of arrears, another 8.7 percent of GDP is due within one year on principal
alone. If we add to that the interest on current and past due obligations accrued this year, the
total debt service faced by Antigua and Barbuda in 2010 surpasses 17 percent of GDP—and
this would only be sufficient for the country to avoid further defaults and increases in arrears.
Reflecting these dire conditions, rollover risks had already materialized by mid-2009, with
the cessation of most lending operations from domestic banks and external creditors, along
with significant under-subscription in the auctions of Antigua and Barbuda’s treasury bills at
the Regional Government Securities Market (RGSM).
6.
Antigua and Barbuda has initiated debt restructuring renegotiations with some
of its main creditors. Discussions are underway with the statutory bodies—especially the
Social Security Board and the Medical Benefit Scheme—which are expected to provide a
significant relief in terms of stocks and flows. Furthermore, the authorities reported bilateral
agreements with some indigenous banks towards the conversion of overdraft balances (with
an average annual interest rate of 13 percent and very short maturity) into regular loans (with
an average annual interest rate of 8.5 percent and multi-year maturities). In parallel, the
authorities have negotiated with multilaterals the clearance of its arrears in the coming
months. Finally, the authorities are also seeking relief from bilateral official creditors within
the context of the Paris Club.

4
Macroeconomic Assumptions
7.
The debt sustainability analysis is based on the following assumptions, in line with
the macroeconomic framework presented in the staff report:


The adjustment measures included in the 2010 budget are expected to yield an
average primary surplus of 3.6 percent of GDP over the medium term. In addition,
public sector reforms, and in particular civil service reform, could further raise the
primary surplus up to 4.2 percent of GDP by 2013-14.



Growth is expected to recover starting 2011, while inflation will continue subdued.
Due to the global financial crisis and the collapse of the Stanford and the CL Financial
groups, the three most important sectors of the Antiguan economy (tourism, construction,
and banking services) are expected to continue underperforming this year, with initial
signs of recovery to become noticeable by 2011. Real GDP growth would decline by
2 percent in 2010, and then begin to recover slowly, reaching 4 percent over the medium
term, reflecting inter alia the recovery in tourism and the benefits of structural reforms.



Exports of goods as a percentage of GDP are expected to remain flat, but tourism
receipts are projected to pick up with a modest increase in tourism-related FDI
inflows. Given the low liquidity in the domestic banking system, financing gaps would
need to be filled mostly externally. For this reason, and based on the regional experience,
it is assumed a mix of domestic and external financing—both in the form of six-year
bonds, at an initial interest rate of 7½ percent, with increments of 50 basis points each
year over the medium term.



Privatization. While this is not incorporated into the scenarios below due to high
uncertainty and political sensitivity, the authorities plan to privatize a small number of
public enterprises, which could contribute to debt reduction over the medium term.



Fund program. We consider
public debt developments in the
context of a three-year SBA with
access of SDR 81 million
(600 percent of quota). The
disbursements are programmed to
become available on a quarterly
basis following the Board’s
approval after each review, and to
respect the normal access limits
(200 percent of quota disbursed
each year, up to a maximum of
600 percent of quota cumulative).

8.
This analysis is based on the assumption that arrears would be cleared in 2010.
The authorities are seeking a resolution from Parliament authorizing the swap of the arrears
with statutory bodies for long-term bonds (30-year maturity, 5-year grace period, and step-up
coupon that starts at zero and increases by 100 basis points every five years, up to
6 percent).3 For the remaining domestic arrears—mainly unpaid vouchers and matured
securities—the assumption is commercial terms (12-year bonds, 5-year grace period, and a
fixed coupon of 7.5 percent). For the external arrears, in light of the unknown outcome of the
discussions with the Paris Club, we assumed similar commercial terms to clear the arrears
with commercial and official creditors, but to the latter group the Commercial Interest
Reference Rate (CIRR) would apply.
9.
A comprehensive debt restructuring is needed to put Antigua’s total PPG on a
sustainable path. Even with the substantial fiscal measures contemplated, PPG debt would
not decline significantly as a share of GDP in the absence of a comprehensive debt
restructuring. Under the baseline scenario, which includes debt restructuring already
underway, debt declines slowly, from 115 percent of GDP at end-2009 to 105 percent of
GDP at the completion of the IMF program in 2013 (Table 1). The bound tests using the
baseline scenario indicate vulnerability to a range of shocks (including growth rates, primary
balance, interest rates, and contingent liabilities) (Figure 2). The ratio of PPG debt to GDP is
projected to fall at a more robust pace with full implementation of the programmed
restructuring.
10.
A comprehensive public debt rescheduling is also necessary to reduce external
vulnerabilities. Due to the high debt-stabilizing non-interest current account, Antigua’s
external debt would remain at 44 percent of GDP even after a severe compression in its
deficit in the balance of goods and services (Table 2)4. Likewise, positive gains from higher
economic growth would be offset by the heavy interest burden. Moreover, gross financing
needs would average 20 percent of GDP in the medium term, and the vulnerability to current
account shocks (including deteriorated terms of trade and lower demand for tourism) could
push the external debt up to two-thirds of GDP (Figure 3).
Conclusion
11.
This DSA indicates that Antigua and Barbuda’s risks of debt distress would
remain elevated even in the presence of strong fiscal and external adjustments. In spite
of significant fiscal restraint and trade deficit compression, the PPG debt would linger at
3
4

The legislation is expected to be approved by Parliament in the coming months.

This analysis incorporates debt restructuring currently underway, in particular the restructuring of one external
commercial loan. External arrears are assumed to be cleared on commercial terms.

pre-IMF program levels in the medium term. Under such scenario, the country would be
highly vulnerability to an array of shocks, and the risks of future defaults would be amplified.
A comprehensive debt restructuring, therefore, is a keystone for the consolidation of fiscal
and external sustainability.

IX. Exchange Rate Arrangement: Antigua and Barbuda is a member of the Eastern Caribbean
Central Bank (ECCB), which manages monetary policy and the exchange system for its eight
members. The common currency, the Eastern Caribbean dollar, has been pegged to the
U.S. dollar at the rate of EC$2.70 per U.S. dollar since July 1976. In practice, the ECCB has
operated like a quasi-currency board, maintaining foreign exchange backing of its currency and
demand liabilities of close to 100 percent.
Antigua and Barbuda accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 in
November 1983. It maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on the making of payments
and transfers for current international transactions.
X. Safeguards Assessment: A safeguards assessment of the ECCB was conducted in 2007,
concluding that adequate safeguards were in place to manage resources, including IMF
disbursements. The assessment determined low risk ratings in all ELRIC areas.

XI. Last Article IV Consultation: Antigua and Barbuda is on the standard 12-month cycle. The
last Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on February 4, 2008. The staff
report is SM/08/23, and the accompanying statistical appendix is SM/08/25.
XII. FSAP Participation, ROSCs, and OFC Assessments:
Antigua and Barbuda participated in the regional ECCU FSAP conducted in September and
October 2003. The FSSA is available at www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2004/cr04293.pdf. A

Appendix II. Antigua and Barbuda: Relations with the World Bank Group
(As of April 15, 2010)
The World Bank is in the process of elaborating its Eastern Caribbean Sub-Regional
Partnership Strategy for FY10–14 which is scheduled to be presented to the Bank’s Board in
June 2010. The Bank’s Eastern Caribbean Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for FY06–09
supported the sub-region’s development agenda through two main pillars: (1) stimulating
growth and improving competitiveness; and (2) reducing vulnerability, by promoting greater
social inclusion and strengthening disaster risk management. Antigua and Barbuda did not
borrow under the FY06–09 CAS.
The Bank is engaged with the authorities through two grants offering technical assistance in:
(1) preparing an Action Plan for the management of phasing out of Chloroflurocarbons
($100,000 from a Bank-administered multidonor trust fund, approved in February 2009); and
(2) enhancing the efficiency of personnel expenditures by achieving a fiscally sustainable
wage bill in support of the National Economic and Social Transformation (NEST) Plan
($310,000 from the Institutional Development Fund, approved in January 2010). Further, the
Bank, collaborating with UNICEF and UNIFEM, has agreed to provide technical assistance
in support of the government’s efforts to strengthen its social safety nets program.
In addition, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) carried out its first direct investment
in Antigua and Barbuda, in the education sector in the amount of US$30 million. The loan to
a tertiary institution is expected to help diversify the local economy and contribute to local
employment and development of service industries. The authorities have engaged the IFC to
provide advisory services on divestiture of state-owned assets.
Additionally, Antigua and Barbuda will benefit from recently completed, ongoing and
planned analytical and advisory activities to support the CAS’ two main pillars including: an
OECS study on Growth and Competitiveness (2005); an OECS Skills Enhancement Policy
Note (2006); a Caribbean Air Transport Report (2006), and a regional study on Crime,
Violence, and Development: Trends, Costs, and Policy Options in the Caribbean (2007). In
addition, an OECS Private Sector Financing Study and the OECS Tourism Backward
Linkages Study were completed in 2008. The publication “Caribbean—Accelerating Trade
Integration: Policy Options for Sustained Growth, Job Creation and Poverty Reduction” and
the “CARICOM study on Managing Nurse Migration” were released in the summer of 2009
and in the first quarter of 2010, respectively. A preparatory study, ultimately aimed at
developing a Caribbean Regional Electricity Generation, Interconnection and Fuel Supply
Strategy, is being finalized.

6
Appendix III. Antigua and Barbuda: Relations with the Caribbean Development Bank
(As of December 31, 2009)
Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) has supported Antigua and Barbuda’s economic and
social development by providing finance for priority capital projects and technical assistance.
In addition, CDB has undertaken analytical work and engaged in policy dialogue on major
developmental issues with the Government of Antigua and Barbuda. Since its inception in
1970, CDB’s involvement in Antigua and Barbuda has included:
-

assisting in the development and implementation of macroeconomic, social and
sectoral policies aimed at maintaining sustainable economic growth;

-

improving the skills of the country’s human resource base;

-

providing direct and indirect financing to the agriculture, manufacturing and tourism
sectors; and

-

assisting in emergency disaster relief and rehabilitation.

Major projects currently under implementation include:
-

a consolidated line of credit to the Antigua and Barbuda Development Bank to
finance mortgages, small and medium-sized enterprise development and student
loans;

-

a project to improve security at the V. C. Bird International Airport and the St. John’s
Deepwater Harbour to meet new international standards;

-

a loan to support the transformation of LIAT (1974) Ltd., the intra-regional airline
into a profitable enterprise by increasing its operational efficiency and strengthening
its institutional capabilities; and

-

a technical assistance grant to strengthen the operations of the Statistical Division in
the Ministry of Finance, the Economy and Public Administration.

At the end of December 2009, CDB had approved US$71.8 million in loans, contingent
loans, equity and grants to Antigua and Barbuda, of which undrawn balances totalled
US$7.4 million.

Appendix IV. Antigua and Barbuda: Statistical Issues
(As of April 14, 2010)
Antigua and Barbuda participates in the Fund’s General Data Dissemination System
(GDDS), but metadata for the real, fiscal and external sectors and plans for improvement
have not been updated since October 2002. Data provided to the Fund are broadly adequate
for surveillance purposes but significant areas for improvement remain in the real sector
(including the consumer price index), fiscal and balance of payments data. An April 2007
data ROSC mission to assess monetary and financial statistics noted some recent
improvements and identified some shortcomings in the ECCB’s monetary statistics. In
December 2009, a STA technical assistance mission took place to follow up on the ROSC
and the ECCB has developed an action plan to implement the recommendations of the
mission.
1.

Real sector statistics

The national accounts are currently being rebased to a more recent year (2006) in accordance
with the methodology of the 1993 System of National Accounts. The ECCB is planning to
release the rebased national accounts of all member countries in September 2010. As part of
the rebasing exercise, improvements in coverage, data sources, and methodology will be
incorporated. Revisions will also be made to the classification of the GDP by economic
activity. It is expected that the current GDP series have been grossly underestimated. Annual
national account statistics are provided to the IMF for publication in the International Financial
Statistics (IFS).

The ECCU is also rebasing national CPIs to a more recent year (January 2010) and the new
index is expected to be published in September 2010 at the same time as the rebased national
accounts. The new basket of goods and services will better reflect the importance of rent and
owner’s imputed rents, and additional outlets will be added to better cover services such as
mobile phones, computers, and health insurance.
There is no comprehensive labor force survey and thus little coverage of the labor market
developments. An Annual Wages and Hours Worked Survey for the private sector was
conducted in 2003, though the coverage of Barbuda was limited. (was the survey for Antigua
only or for the ECCU?) Work has already started for the 2010 population census.
2.

Government finance statistics

The annual and quarterly data on central government finances published by the ECCB are
compiled broadly in line with the methodology set out in the 1986 Government Financial
Statistics Manual. For the past several years, however, Antigua and Barbuda has not been
reporting government finance statistics to the Fund for inclusion in the Government Finance

9
Statistics Yearbook (GFSY) and the International Financial Statistics (IFS). To better
understand the underlying fiscal situation of member countries, the ECCB has agreed that the
ECCU would implement the methodology of the Government Finance Statistics Manual
2001 (GFSM 2001) by May 2011. STA has proposed to organize a five-day regional
workshop in St-Kitts in early Fall 2010 to help ECCU member countries move to the GFSM
2001.
3.

Monetary and financial statistics

Monetary statistics are compiled by the ECCB on a monthly basis with a lag of six weeks. In
July 2006, the ECCB started reporting monetary and financial statistics to the Fund in
accordance with the methodology of the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM
2000); the associated data have been published in the IFS Supplement since September 2006.
In November 2009, a STA mission helped the ECCB expand the coverage of the Other
Depository Corporations Survey (ODCs) to include mortgage companies, finance companies,
building societies, credit unions, and development banks; the mission also helped develop a
financial corporations’ survey, which would include other financial corporations (OFCs)
such as offshore banks, trust companies, mutual funds, money service firms, and insurance
companies. The ECCB has developed an action plan to implement the recommendations of
the TA mission and the new ODC survey is expected be available by the end of 2010.
4.

External sector statistics

The ECCB is also preparing new BOP survey forms, which will include trade in services and
provide a better coverage of FDI. In the medium-term, the improved forms will allow for the
presentation of the BOP in the Extended Balance of Payments Services (EBOPS) and for the
preparation of the International Investment Position (IIP). Due to delay in updating the
software to reflect changes made to the survey form, the launch of the new survey forms has
been postponed. The ECCB reports annual balance of payments statistics for dissemination in the
Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook (BOPSY). Antigua and Barbuda, however, does not
report trade data for publication in the Direction of Trade Statistics Yearbook (DOTS).

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2010 Article IV Consultation with
Antigua and Barbuda
On June, 07, 2010, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Antigua and Barbuda.1
Background
Antigua and Barbuda’s economy is experiencing its worst recession in decades. The global
slowdown has severely affected the economy through its impact on tourist arrivals, Foreign
Direct Investment (FDI) inflows and remittances, and fiscal revenue. Real GDP contracted by
7 percent in 2009 after expanding on average by about 6 percent during the previous 5 years.
Following a spike in 2008, inflation has remained in the low single digits despite a 20 percent
increase in fuel prices and higher consumption taxes. The recession and associated fiscal crisis
coincided with an already unsustainable fiscal situation and mounting problems in the financial
sector—the collapse of the Stanford Group (the largest private conglomerate) and of the
Trinidad-based CL Financial Group.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2

Following many years of accumulation of arrears to domestic and external creditors, the fiscal
situation turned critical in 2009 as the recession led to a 20 percent decline in tax revenue.
Meanwhile, recorded primary expenditure rose by 4.5 percent of GDP due to higher-thanbudgeted current outlays. The overall fiscal deficit widened from 6 percent of GDP in 2008 to
about 19 percent in 2009. With limited financing options, the government accumulated arrears
amounting to about 9 percent of GDP to domestic and external creditors, bringing the total stock
of arrears to about 53 percent of GDP, or 45 percent of the outstanding public debt, which
totaled 115 percent of GDP. To contain the deterioration in the fiscal position, the authorities
implemented revenue measures in mid-2009 amounting to about 1.5 percent of GDP on an
annualized basis. These included raising petroleum product prices in August, by an average of
20 percent (about 1.5 percent of GDP), while introducing a flexible and market-based
petroleum-product pricing mechanism.
The external current account deficit narrowed to 25 percent of GDP in 2009, reflecting a decline
in FDI inflows. Aside from some financing from Venezuela, the deficit was financed mainly by a
drawdown in commercial banks foreign asset position, a reduction in Antigua and Barbuda’s
share of international reserves at the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB), and the further
accumulation of arrears on public external debt.
The contraction of economic activity has resulted in a significant slowdown in private sector
credit growth, while domestic bank lending rates have remained broadly stable. However,
non-performing loans fell sharply in 2009 as percent of total loans, reflecting the restructuring of
loans to both government and the private sector. In February 2009, the ECCB assumed control
of the Bank of Antigua following a sharp withdrawal of deposits precipitated by the collapse of
the Stanford Group. This has resulted in a shift of about 20 percent of indigenous banks’
deposits to foreign owned banks.
The authorities have requested Fund financial assistance and the Executive Board approved a
three-year Stand-By Arrangement in June (see Press Release No. 10/232) in support of a
comprehensive reform strategy aimed at restoring fiscal and debt sustainability. The reforms
include a significant and sustained tightening of fiscal policy supported by a comprehensive
debt restructuring and structural reforms to strengthen the customs and inland revenue
departments. The approved 2010 budget built on the fiscal measures taken in mid-2009, and
features additional measures that are designed to shift the fiscal position to primary surplus of
3 percent of GDP from a primary deficit of 11.5 percent of GDP in 2009. These measures,
which include prioritizing capital and goods and services expenditure and a freeze on public
sector wages, will be complemented by revenue measures aimed at returning the tax-to-GDP
ratio to pre-crisis levels and bring the overall deficit to zero by 2012. The authorities have
approached their domestic and external creditors seeking to restructure their public debt and to
regularize the extremely high level of arrears. The authorities’ strategy also includes
strengthening supervision and regulation of the financial sector to increase its resilience to
shocks and reduce macro-financial risks.

3

Executive Board Assessment
The Executive Directors commended the authorities for their strong and comprehensive
response to the exogenous shocks to tourism receipts, FDI inflows and remittances, which led
to the most severe recession experienced by Antigua and Barbuda. The already unsustainable
fiscal position, with high public debt and a large stock of arrears, turned critical and problems
also mounted in the financial sector. Directors endorsed the authorities’ three-pronged strategy
comprising front-loaded fiscal adjustment measures, debt restructuring, and structural reforms
to further strengthen the fiscal position, address financial sector vulnerabilities and foster
growth. They stressed the critical importance of full implementation of this strategy which
underpins the Fund-supported program.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to a strong fiscal adjustment program, which
will constitute a decisive step towards restoring debt sustainability. They observed that the
combination of both, raising tax revenue and cutting expenditure by prioritizing capital spending
and reducing the wage bill, are needed to shift the fiscal position from a significant primary
deficit to a surplus. They welcomed the actions already taken and emphasized that maintaining
fiscal discipline and following through on additional measures, if needed, would also be
important. Directors stressed that sustained commitment to the planned fiscal structural
reforms, including strengthening revenue agencies and reforming the civil service, social
security and public financial management, will be central to further fortifying the fiscal position.
Directors emphasized that comprehensive domestic and external debt restructuring is
paramount for achieving debt sustainability, given that the public debt of Antigua and Barbuda is
unsustainable even with the significant fiscal adjustment envisaged. They welcomed the
authorities’ first steps to engage in open and transparent negotiations with external creditors as
part of a restructuring strategy. In this context, Directors considered it essential to engage also
non-Paris Club creditors and to seek treatment comparable to Paris Club creditors. Directors
stressed that, since the bulk of the interest relief will come from restructuring domestic debt, the
parametric reform envisaged by the authorities for the social security scheme, a key domestic
creditor, will be essential to ensure its long-term viability.
Directors agreed that the financial sector reform agenda is well focused on both bank and
nonbank segments. Onsite inspection of the banking system by the Eastern Caribbean Central
Bank will provide important and timely information and form the basis to deal with fragilities of
domestic banks. Strengthening the regulation and supervision of offshore financial services and
nonbanks will address major shortcomings in the regulatory framework. Directors welcomed the
ongoing efforts to strengthen legislation concerning anti-money laundering and combating the
financing of terrorism, and encouraged the authorities to persevere in these efforts.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
June 8, 2010

International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Approves Three-Year US$117.8 Million Stand-By Arrangement
with Antigua and Barbuda
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has approved a three-year
Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) for an amount equivalent to SDR 81 million (about
US$ 117.8 million) with Antigua and Barbuda. The arrangement will support the authorities’
efforts to restore fiscal and debt sustainability and set the stage for a sustained recovery.
Antigua and Barbuda’s tourism-dependent economy has been severely impacted by the
global economic and financial crisis. Falling tourism and foreign direct investment (FDI)related construction activities have triggered the worst recession in decades and contributed
to a sharp decline in government revenue. This has aggravated an already unsustainable fiscal
position resulting from longstanding fiscal imbalances and accumulation of a large stock of
arrears to domestic and external creditors.
Following the Board’s decision, a sum equivalent to SDR 16.875 million (about
US$24.5 million) is available for immediate disbursement. The three-year SBA arrangement
represents 600 percent of Antigua and Barbuda’s SDR 13.50 million IMF quota. Antigua and
Barbuda joined the Fund in February 1982.
Following the Executive Board’s discussion of Antigua and Barbuda, Mr. Murilo Portugal,
Deputy Managing Director and Acting Chair, made the following statement:
“The Antiguan economy has been severely impacted by large exogenous shocks to tourism
receipts, FDI inflows, and remittances. These shocks have led to a marked decline in
economic activity, weakened the balance of payments, and exacerbated an unsustainable
fiscal position.
“The government has formulated a comprehensive policy framework for restoring fiscal and
debt sustainability which is supported by the IMF. The three-pronged approach comprises
front-loaded adjustment measures, debt restructuring, and structural reforms to further

2

strengthen the fiscal position, address financial sector vulnerabilities, and foster growth. The
substantial measures already taken by authorities target a primary surplus of 3 percent of
GDP following a primary deficit of 11½ percent last year.
“Over the medium term, structural reforms will play a central role in the authorities’ efforts
to further strengthen the fiscal position and balance the budget by 2012. These include the
much needed strengthening of revenue collection agencies, public financial management
reforms and improvements in the efficiency of public spending. Notwithstanding the strength
of fiscal adjustment, the comprehensive public debt restructuring sought by the authorities is
critical to achieving debt sustainability.
“The program also aims to rebuild international reserves to prudent levels and safeguard the
stability of the payments system. To this end, the program includes measures to contain the
risks to the financial system by bolstering supervision, including enhancing onsite inspection
to detect and address the fragilities of domestic banks. The authorities will also put in place
an effective regulatory framework for offshore financial services and nonbank financial
institutions.
“The authorities’ comprehensive and bold strategy merits strong support of the international
community. While subject to considerable risks, if fully implemented, the program will
provide a framework for the needed adjustment and financing, placing Antigua and
Barbuda’s economy back on a path of macroeconomic stability and sustained economic
growth.”
ANNEX
Recent Economic Developments
Antigua and Barbuda’s economy contracted by 7 percent in 2009, experiencing its worst
recession in decades. The global slowdown has severely affected Antigua and Barbuda’s
economy through its impact on tourist arrivals, FDI inflows and remittances, and fiscal
revenue. The recession and associated fiscal crisis coincides with already weak public
finances and mounting problems in the financial sector, including the collapse of the Stanford
Group and the Trinidad-based CL Financial Group.
Following many years of accumulation of arrears to domestic and external creditors, the
fiscal situation turned critical in 2009 as the recession led to a 20 percent decline in tax
revenue. The overall fiscal deficit widened from 6 percent of GDP in 2008 to about
19 percent in 2009, public debt increased to 115 percent and the total stock of arrears rose to
about 53 percent of GDP, or 45 percent of the outstanding public debt.

finances in 2010 and entrench the downward trend for the public debt ratio in subsequent
years, thereby setting the stage for restored fiscal and external sustainability and revival of
private investment.
Key reform objectives include:







Continuous implementation of fiscal adjustment measures on both expenditure and
revenue sides.
Orderly restructuring of Antigua and Barbuda’s debt in view of normalizing relations
with its domestic and external creditors.
Enhancing public financial management through improved reporting and auditing in
ministries.

programs.

Statement by Thomas Hockin, Executive Director for Antigua and Barbuda and
Glenn Purves, Senior Advisor to the Executive Director for Antigua and Barbuda
June 7, 2010
At the outset, our authorities from Antigua and Barbuda wish to express their appreciation to
the staff and management for the constructive policy dialogue, reflected in a very wellwritten document that accurately highlights the numerous risks and challenges that the
authorities face.
The commitment of the government of Antigua and Barbuda to the program is discernable
via the significant up-front fiscal measures they have taken thus far, their ongoing efforts to
restructure their domestic and external debts to reduce interest costs and clear arrears, and
their clear actions to strengthen the structures underpinning their fiscal and financial sector
activities.
The principle of the program is to immediately contain debt accumulation and get it on a
downward trajectory, whilst targeting repayment of domestic supplier arrears to support the
private sector and growth. To achieve this, the authorities have implemented massive shortterm fiscal adjustment to swing them into a primary balance surplus, and are pursuing debt
restructuring to exit the program period in an overall surplus position. In the wake of
registering a 19 percent of GDP overall deficit for 2009, such measures are vital and have
been implemented as part of Budget 2010 which Parliament passed at the end of 2009.
As the staff paper identifies, in support of the authorities’ macroeconomic and structural
reform program they are seeking the Board’s support for an SDR 81 million (600 percent of
quota) loan under a 36-month Stand-By Arrangement. The Caribbean Development Bank
Board of Directors has also approved a US$30 million policy based loan to be disbursed over
three years, pending approval of an IMF program.
Background
For the past two decades, tourism and tourism-related construction have been the main
drivers of economic growth, contributing to over two-thirds of GDP. After expanding
robustly in the 1980s (growth rates averaging 13.6 percent per year), the economy of Antigua
and Barbuda began to slow in the 1990s with growth averaging 5.7 percent due to rapid
growth in fiscal imbalances and more rapid accumulation of public sector debt.
The current financial crisis, the largest in Antigua & Barbuda’s history has led to a 7 percent
economic contraction in 2009, driven by a widespread decline in construction, tourism,
transport, wholesale, retail trade, and communications sectors. In particular, construction and
tourism were adversely affected by a lack of financing as well as a decline in consumer
spending in Antigua’s major trading partners, most notably the US and the UK. The collapse

2
of the Stanford Financial Group (SFG), a direct employer of 1,200, also had an impact on the
economy.
Taken together, the Government experienced a decline in revenues of almost 22 percent in
2009.
The Program - Restoring Fiscal Sustainability in 2010
In consultation with international financial institutions, regional bodies and domestic
stakeholders, a comprehensive set of structural reforms and long-term policies, detailed in the
authorities’ National Economic and Social Transformation Plan (NEST), have been
formulated to restore fiscal and debt sustainability and place the economy on a firm footing.
The NEST plan calls for an aggressive shift in the primary balance of 12.3 percent of GDP in
2010 alone (not including grants): 4.5 percent targets the revenue side and comes primarily
from a broadening of Antigua and Barbuda’s VAT equivalent and an increase in import
duties and consumption tax on oil products; the residual 7.8 percent comes from the
expenditure side, primarily reductions in capital expenditures. As the staff report rightly
highlights, these measures along with 2 percent of GDP in grants from the European Union
and Japan are expected to lead to a one-year turnaround in the primary fiscal balance of
roughly 14 - 14.5 percent of GDP, implying a 3 percent primary balance surplus for 2010.
It is important to note that the contraction in capital expenditures will not have a significant
impact on growth given a lower GDP multiplier effect due to high import requirements. It is
also not expected to compromise the infrastructural support for growth since substantial
public sector investments in such capacity took place in more recent years. With this
backdrop, real GDP growth is expected to contract by 2 percent in 2010, despite some pickup in tourism revenues. The improving trend is expected to continue, with real GDP reaching
over 4 percent in the medium-term. Inflation is expected to remain in the 2-3 percent range
over the program period.
Addressing Arrears and Debt Sustainability
Despite the measures already taken in 2010, the authorities would still be facing an interest
bill that would reach roughly 9 percent of GDP in 2010 without action (leaving the overall
balance at 6 percent of GDP). The debt servicing costs need to be addressed if the debt-togdp ratio is to be placed on a meaningful downward trajectory. Thus, achieving a primary
surplus in year one is a necessary but not a sole precondition for the success of this program,
which ultimately focuses on reducing the stock of arrears in the medium term. The
authorities recognize very well the importance of addressing and clearing arrears for
generating good will and co-operation amongst domestic and external creditors alike, and
domestic suppliers that are also taxpayers.

3
The authorities have engaged a debt advisor to assist them in their engagements with
domestic and external creditors on a comprehensive voluntary restructuring that is largely
expected to target interest payments. To date, the authorities have registered much progress
on the domestic side—as illustrated in the staff report (paragraph 10) - and have engaged the
Paris Club of creditors for financial assurances. The authorities have expressed confidence
that they will be able to contain this interest bill by securing at least 4–4.5 percent of GDP in
interest savings in 2010, placing the overall fiscal deficit at a more modest 2–2.5 percent of
GDP (as opposed to 19 percent at the end of 2009).
Exiting the program, the intention is that all domestic arrears with the statutory bodies and
external arrears would be converted, on a voluntary basis, into debt. The authorities would
look to clear their arrears with domestic suppliers, based on the success of the program.
Tackling Needed Structural Reforms
The authorities of Antigua and Barbuda are aware that securing some yields from their NEST
plan will require substantial structural reforms, particularly on the revenue administration
side. Therefore, the authorities’ policy framework incorporates structural reforms aimed at
strengthening the primary balance and addressing financial sector vulnerabilities.
Key to the program is the need to strengthen revenue agencies. While a government can
expand a tax base and impose new charges, ultimately the yield comes from changing the
culture of those already enforcing tax compliance and administration to ensure that those
who are expected to collect do, in fact, collect. The authorities are working very closely with
CARTAC here to develop a UK DFID-financed program for strengthening capacity at the
Customs and Inland Revenue Departments. An important success factor of this initiative is to
have the technical expertise on the ground. As such, the CARTAC consultant is moving to
Antigua and Barbuda for the year to help drive the initiative.
On Public Financial Management (PFM), as the staff report has rightly highlighted, the
government of Antigua and Barbuda have in place a system of controlling expenditure
commitments which requires approval by the Ministry of Finance, but is also looking to
bolster the supporting processes and to establish a single treasury account in the mediumterm. To this end, the government undertook a Public Expenditure and Financial
Accountability Assessment which will be forming the basis for their PFM action plan,
financed through a grant approved by the EU. As well, a new procurement act is currently at
the committee phase of Parliament. This is expected to improve procurement of goods and
services, with interim guidelines which empower the Ministry of Finance to monitor the
process.

4
On the expenditure side, CARTAC is also working closely with the budget and treasury
departments to ensure good expenditure management practices by introducing cash flow
management procedures and budget reforms that will govern the budget call for 2011.
The authorities have also approached the World Bank for their assistance in designing a civil
service reform. This reform is of longstanding importance to the authorities and will be
pursued with vigor over the course of the program period. The staff are developing a
transformation program which will form the basis of work to come, and will identify where
efficiencies can be found in the system. Greater cuts in the wage bill are expected over the
period 2011–12 from this rationalization exercise.
Finally, the authorities intend to strengthen social security finances on the basis of an
actuarial review that is currently being completed. The idea is to adjust the retirement age on
the basis of the actuarial assessment and to introduce reforms necessary to ensure the system
achieves longer-term sustainability. The authorities expect to report more on this following
the first review under the program.
Strengthening the Financial Sector
For the domestic banking sector, harmonized Banking Acts amongst the eight Eastern
Caribbean Currency Union (ECCU) members recognize the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank
(ECCB) as having primary responsibility for the supervision of domestic banks. All
commercial banks and other institutions deemed to be carrying on banking business are
required to be licensed under the Banking Act and are regulated by the ECCB. As part of the
ongoing supervision, licensed financial institutions are required to submit monthly, quarterly
and annual returns to the ECCB. These returns provide essential information to assess the
performance of the institutions and the financial system, and to inform policy decisions. In
addition, periodic visits are made to the institutions to verify the information submitted.
The authorities, along with the ECCB, have committed to strengthening on-site examinations
of domestic banks. The ECCB for its part is on track with respect to the recapitalization of
the Bank of Antigua and conducting on-site inspections of domestic commercial banks.
Ongoing close monitoring by the ECCB and authorities will be essential.
For the offshore financial and domestic nonbank sectors, considerable actions are being taken
to prevent the kind of regulatory arbitrage that ensued with Stanford International Bank and
in the insurance sector. To bolster their system, the program envisages the following:


Strengthening the structure, oversight procedures and capacity of the Financial
Services Regulatory Commission (FSRC), responsible for the offshore financial
sector and domestic nonbanks. The authorities will expedite legislation to create a
single regulatory unit, in line with regional agreements and best practices, and will

5
enhance the staff composition and expertise for oversight purposes. A key element is
that the legislation will be more prescriptive about oversight procedures – the extent
of investigations needed; the reporting requirements, etc. CARTAC has been
providing extensive technical assistance to the authorities here.


Passing remaining amendments to effectively combat money laundering and
financing of terrorism. The authorities have signed 13 Tax Information Exchange
Agreements (TIEAs). The authorities have a dedicated attorney working exclusively
on the legislation amendments to meet the end-June structural benchmark.



Developing a plan for the resolution of insurers, in line with regional efforts. The
authorities will continue active participation in regional efforts to addressing
exposures attributed to CL Financial Insurance Subsidiaries, CL Insurance Company
(CLICO) and British American Insurance Company (BAICO). A regional target of
end-2010 has been set and is also included as a structural benchmark in the program.

Structural Benchmarks – End-June
Speaking with the authorities, it appears they are on track to meet all end-June structural
benchmarks as set out in their MEFP, including those where direct actions are required by the
ECCB.
