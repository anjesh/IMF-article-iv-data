GUATEMALA
Staff Report for the 2009 Article IV Consultation, Second Review Under the Stand-By
Arrangement and Requests for Modification of Performance Criterion and
Consultation Clause
Prepared by the Western Hemisphere Department
(In collaboration with other departments)
Approved by Patricia Alonso-Gamo (WHD) and Dominique Desruelle (SPR)
November 24, 2009
Executive Summary
Economic outcomes. There are signs that the Guatemalan economy is starting to recover. Real GDP
growth and inflation are picking up, imports have begun to grow and net private capital flows have
stabilized. The exchange rate has depreciated by 6.6 percent in 2009. International reserves are higher
than at end-2008. The financial system continues to hold up well.
Policy implementation. Program implementation remains strong. Moderately countercyclical policies
have helped preserve stability and mitigate the growth slowdown. All end-September quantitative
performance criteria were met and annual inflation stood within the inner consultation band set in the
program. The 18-month Stand-By Arrangement is expected to remain precautionary.
Outlook and risks. Real GDP growth is likely to remain low and inflation subdued. Over the medium
term, economic growth is expected to be weaker than prior to the global crisis and inflation to stabilize at
trading partners’ levels. Downside risks could materialize if the incipient U.S. recovery falters.
Program discussions. Macroeconomic policies will have limited scope to continue supporting demand
in 2010; revenue-enhancing measures are needed to stabilize public debt ratios over the medium term.
Staff proposes revising end-March and end-June fiscal deficit targets to provide room for front-loaded
spending in 2010, lowering the inflation consultation bands given a benign inflation outlook, and
changing the frequency of program reviews from quarterly to semi-annual as downside risks to the
program have diminished.
Medium-term challenges. The Article IV consultation discussions focused on:


Achieving higher growth. Increasing investment levels and productivity is key. For this, it will be
critical to create consensus on a comprehensive revenue reform to increase public investment and
social spending, further enhance the business climate, and boost competitiveness.



Anchoring low inflation. It is important to continue improving communication with the market,
maintain exchange rate flexibility, and further strengthen the interest rate channel of monetary
policy transmission.



Increasing the resilience of the financial system. Implementing the amendments to the banking
law and the regulations on liquidity and foreign-currency credit management will be critical.

Exchange Rate Arrangement. Guatemala has a floating exchange rate regime, has accepted the
obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, and its exchange system is free of restrictions on the
making of payments and transfers for current transactions.

I. BACKGROUND
1.
The 2009 Article IV consultation and Second Review under the Stand-By Arrangement
(SBA) took place against the background of an incipient global recovery and continued
macroeconomic stability in Guatemala.1 Although it has been negatively affected by the global
crisis, the Guatemalan economy has maintained higher growth than other countries in the region.
Still, output growth has slowed considerably (driven by declines in exports, remittances, tourism
receipts, investment, and capital inflows), and inflationary pressures have eased. Yet, the latest data
suggest that the recovery is gaining steam (Figure 1).
2.
The authorities’ economic policies, supported by the 18-month SBA with the Fund,
have helped preserve macroeconomic stability and mitigate the impact of the global crisis. The
authorities’ strategy has focused on adopting moderately countercyclical fiscal and monetary
policies, maintaining exchange rate flexibility, advancing reforms to further strengthen the financial
sector, and refocusing public expenditures toward social spending and infrastructure―as set out in
the National Program of Emergency and Economic Recovery (PNERE).

the composition of the Monetary Board. However,
Guatemala’s strong record of low inflation and macroeconomic stability suggests that such
constraint has not materialized so far.2 Reforms to enhance governance, strengthen institutions, and
increase and improve the provision of public goods have proceeded slowly. To attain higher growth
and productivity while preserving macroeconomic stability, it will be necessary to make significant
gains on all these fronts, including by reaching consensus on a revenue-enhancing reform in line
with the goals of the 1996 Peace Accords. Regarding the financial sector, there is scope to further
enhance crisis preparedness and resolution procedures, and to improve credit and currency risk
management.

Discussions were held in Guatemala City during November 3–12. The staff team comprised Mr. López-Mejía (Head), Ms. Martin,
Mr. Morra (all WHD), Mr. Fenochietto (FAD), and Mr. Henn (SPR), and was assisted by Mr. Delgado (regional resident
representative). The mission met with President Colom, Central Bank President de Bonilla, Minister of Finance Fuentes Knight, other
members of the economic cabinet, members of Parliament, Superintendent of Banks Barquín, other senior officials, academics, and
representatives of the private sector. Mr. Gramajo (OED) joined some meetings.

The Monetary Board’s composition is determined by the country’s Constitution. However, the 2002 Organic Law of the Central
Bank enhanced the financial and operational autonomy of the Central Bank. Moreover, since 1993 the constitution forbids central
bank’s credit (direct or indirect) to the public sector.

II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
4.
Economic activity is recovering while inflation remains low (Figures 1 and 2).
After stagnating during the first quarter of 2009, the monthly indicator of economic activity
resumed growth (month-on-month seasonally-adjusted) in the second quarter. Consumer
prices began to increase again in April, but monthly inflation remains low (0.2 percent, on
average, during April–October). As of end-October, annual headline inflation was
-0.6 percent.

preliminary evidence from foreign
exchange flows indicate that private capital outflows have slowed.
6.
The financial system has remained
resilient. With bank deposits maintaining
their growth momentum (12.2 percent y-o-y
as of September) and credit stagnant,
liquidity is ample. Capitalization levels
remain high (13.5 percent of risk-weighted
assets as of September 2009). As the
economy has slowed, nonperforming loans
have risen moderately and profitability has
declined.

Exchange rate pressures have been
short-lived. Following a moderate depreciation during July–September, the quetzal has
appreciated by 1 percent since early October. Still, the nominal exchange rate has depreciated
6.6 percent in 2009. In the third quarter, the central bank sold US$221 million in the
interbank/foreign exchange market, half of it on a discretionary basis. In late September,

8.
The authorities have continued to implement moderate counter-cyclical policies
to support domestic demand. In September, the Monetary Board reduced the policy interest
rate by 25 basis points to 4.50 percent (from 7.25 percent at end-2008), though the monetary
easing has had limited impact on bank lending rates. The fiscal deficit reached 1.4 percent of
GDP during January–September, owing to a decline of 7.6 percent (y-o-y) in tax revenues
and a 13.2 percent (y-o-y) increase in spending. The authorities have placed all the domestic
bonds planned for 2009, and Congress has recently approved a loan from the World Bank
(for US$350 million, of which US$150 million will be disbursed in 2009).
9.
Program implementation continues to be strong. All end-September quantitative
performance criteria were met, annual inflation stood within the inner consultation band, and
government deposits at the central bank were above the indicative target.
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Macroeconomic Outlook and Risks
10.
The near-term outlook is of a gradual recovery. Real GDP growth is projected to
be around 0.4 percent in 2009 and rise to 1.3 percent in 2010. With output below potential,
inflation is expected to remain low, closing 2009 at around 0.8 percent and rising to 4 percent
by end-2010 owing to base effects and higher oil prices. The external current account is
projected to post a small deficit by end-2009 as the economy recovers.

demand; and the effects of structural
reforms will take time to stimulate domestic sources of growth. As a result, staff envisages
that, over the medium term, real GDP will grow at about 3½ percent (compared to a mediumterm growth assumption of 4 percent at program approval), with private investment gradually

9
returning to pre-crisis levels, and inflation stabilizing at around 4 percent. The external
current account deficit is projected to fluctuate around 4–4½ percent of GDP.
12.
Risks to the economic outlook have moderated. The stabilization of global and
domestic financial conditions have reduced risks of large private capital outflows and a
disorderly depreciation of the quetzal. However, Guatemala’s close ties to the United States
(through trade, the banking system and remittances) suggest that downside risks could
materialize if the incipient U.S. recovery falters. In addition, lack of success in lowering the
fiscal deficit and reining in public debt could have adverse effects on confidence and
economic performance.
The recovery is expected to be slow

B. Program Discussions
Fiscal Policy
13.
There was agreement that fiscal policy should continue striking a balance
between supporting demand and preserving fiscal sustainability. Staff supported the
fiscal policy stance adopted by the authorities in 2009, which accommodated a revenue
decline of 1.3 percent of GDP while raising spending in social programs and public works by
0.3 percent of GDP. The policies are projected to raise the fiscal deficit to 3.4 percent of
GDP in 2009 (from 1.6 percent of GDP in 2008), delivering a stimulus of about 0.4 percent
of GDP during the year. However, the authorities noted that delays in executing some
expenditure could result in a somewhat lower fiscal deficit. The authorities and staff
concurred that the scope for maintaining an expansionary fiscal policy stance in 2010 was
limited by the low tax revenue ratio (10 percent of GDP) and the need to preserve fiscal
sustainability. In line with this view, the draft 2010 budget (expected to be approved by
Congress by end-November), envisages a gradual withdrawal of the fiscal stimulus by
targeting a fiscal deficit of 3.1 percent of GDP. As part of their financing program, the
authorities envisage placing a US$500 million bond in international markets in 2010.
14.
Staff welcomed the authorities’ commitment to safeguarding medium-term fiscal
sustainability. The fiscal deficits projected for 2009 and 2010 are expected to raise the
public debt-to-GDP ratio to 25½ percent by end 2010 (up from 20.4 percent in 2008). Staff

trade zones.3 The mission underscored that
stabilizing the debt-to-GDP ratio could require revenue measures for about 1 percent of GDP
to reduce the fiscal deficit to 1.7 percent of GDP by 2011.4 The authorities agreed that
additional efforts were needed to reduce the fiscal deficit to pre-crisis levels and stabilize
debt dynamics.
15.
A draft law has been submitted to Congress increasing stamps and corporate
income tax rates and creating a tax on mobile phone usage. The changes could yield
revenues for up to 1.0 percent of GDP and come into effect in 2010 to finance higher
expenditures, mostly in education, health, security, and transfers to municipalities. The
mission welcomed the effort to increase revenues, noting that the impact of the proposed
changes to direct taxation will be felt mostly in the second half of 2010 and should not
jeopardize the incipient economic recovery. Staff stressed the need to strengthen tax
administration and recommended that any excess of tax revenues over the amounts projected
be used to reduce the fiscal deficit below the target and not to increase spending.
16.
The authorities and staff agreed on the need to continue increasing fiscal
transparency and improving efficiency and expenditure management. The authorities
noted that the amount of information available online has increased and procurement systems
have been enhanced. In addition, with technical assistance from the World Bank and the
InterAmerican Development Bank, progress has been made on the design, implementation,
and monitoring of the conditional cash transfer program Mi Familia Progresa. However,
weaknesses in budget controls have led to the accumulation of domestic arrears (of about
0.2 percent of GDP), though they are expected to be fully cleared before year end. The
authorities restated their commitment to enhance mechanisms of expenditure management
and control as well as transparency, including that of trust funds (used to execute
expenditure). To this end, the authorities have established a register of infrastructure
contracts and are committed to increase the amount of public information available and make
allocations to trust funds dependent on disclosure of their spending records.

However, the law on free trade zones has recently been challenged in the constitutional court.

In IMF Country Report No. 09/305, staff had estimated that additional revenue, equivalent to ½ percent of
GDP were necessary to stabilize the public debt-to GDP ratio. That estimate assumed the adoption of a reform
to the system of indirect taxes, which was withdrawn from Congress in August 2009; the estimate also did not
take into account the implementation of the law on free trade zones.

11
Monetary, Exchange Rate, and Financial Sector Policies
17.
Staff noted that the gradual easing of the monetary policy stance has been
appropriate, including to help avoid disorderly exchange rate movements. Even though
the inflation outlook remains benign, and the consultation bands were lowered accordingly,
upward risks stem from potential future increases in oil prices. In view of this, it was agreed
that the central bank should remain vigilant and adjust the policy rate as needed to anchor
inflation expectations around the official inflation target (5 percent by end-2010 and end2011, plus/minus one percentage point).

had allowed more timely interventions and helped manage market expectations. At the same
time, staff reiterated that exchange rate flexibility is key to strengthening the inflationtargeting monetary policy framework over the medium term.
19.
The authorities stressed their commitment to
keep monitoring closely banking sector developments.
They agreed that the financial system had weathered the
crisis well thus far, but banks remained exposed to credit
and currency risks. The mission welcomed progress on
revamping provisioning requirements to ensure full
provisioning of nonperforming loans by 2011. Staff also
encouraged the authorities to continue working with
Congress to ensure prompt approval of the amendments
to the banking law and to finalize the preparation of the
regulations on banks’ liquidity and foreign currency risk
management (end-December structural benchmarks).

Program Modalities
20.
Program implementation has been strong. A new set of quantitative performance
criteria has been agreed through end-June 2010 (Attachment I), and the program is fully
financed. The reporting requirements in the technical memorandum of understanding were
revised to ensure greater clarity, including on reporting deadlines, in light of the new
framework to reduce blackout periods. Based on the discussions for the second review, staff
proposes:


Revising upwards the performance criterion on the overall fiscal deficit for endMarch 2010 to provide room for front-loaded spending to support the incipient
recovery.



Adjusting downwards the inflation consultation band for December 2009 and
March and June 2010 to take into account the benign inflation outlook.



Switching to semiannual reviews while maintaining quarterly test dates and
purchases in view of the lower downside risks to the program. Accordingly, staff
proposes to have two additional reviews, based on end-March and end-June
performance criteria (PCs), and to bring forward to February 15, 2010 the right to
make the purchase that would become available if the end-December PCs are met.

C. Surveillance Discussions
21.
Guatemala faces several key medium-term policy challenges. These include
achieving higher and sustainable growth and reducing poverty, anchoring inflation at low
levels, and further strengthening the resilience of the financial system. While progress has
been made since the last Article IV consultation, significant challenges remain.

13
Box 1. Past Fund Policy Recommendations and Implementation
The previous Article IV consultation highlighted the need to increase Guatemala’s resilience to adverse
shocks and sustain high growth rates to reduce poverty. Directors recommended:


Raising tax revenues to strengthen social policies, security, and infrastructure, while improving
the transparency and efficiency of public spending. Considering the low level of public debt,
Directors saw scope for letting automatic stabilizers play a role in an economic slowdown.
During 2009, the authorities have implemented a moderate countercyclical fiscal policy and
stepped up social expenditures.



Increasing monetary policy effectiveness and strengthening the credibility of the inflation
targeting framework by allowing greater exchange rate flexibility. Directors supported the
authorities’ efforts to strengthen the monetary policy transmission mechanism. Progress has been
made in this area (¶26), partly supported by Fund technical assistance.



Further increasing the resilience of the financial system by enhancing the bank resolution
framework, better ring-fencing offshore banks, and eliminating legal constraints to effective
banking supervision. Directors also advised to build larger capital cushions and increase loan-loss
provisioning. The authorities are addressing these issues, including in the draft amendments to the
Banking Law (submitted to Congress in June 2009).

Raising Growth and Reducing Poverty
22.
Achieving and sustaining higher growth is key to reduce poverty. The authorities
and staff agreed on the need to design a comprehensive strategy to boost the potential growth
rate of the economy (currently estimated at around 3½ percent) to reduce the high incidence
of poverty. In addition to maintaining macroeconomic stability, the strategy will require
increasing investment levels, productivity, and competitiveness. To this end, it would be
critical to speed up structural reforms to address long-standing weaknesses in education,
health, public security, governance, and infrastructure (Figure 4).
23.
The implementation of a revenue-enhancing reform should be a key element of
the growth and poverty-reduction strategy (Figure 5). A low tax revenue-to-GDP ratio
constrains the government’s ability to sustain desirable levels of critical public expenditures
(e.g., in social programs and infrastructure). The authorities and staff discussed possible
measures to raise public revenues to boost social and investment spending over the medium
term, in line with the goals of the 1996 Peace Accords. To that end, the mission presented a
menu of options that could increase revenues by up to 3.2 percentage points of GDP and
could be implemented gradually starting in 2011. The menu includes reforms to the corporate
and personal income tax, a reduction in tax exemptions, changes to the small taxpayers VAT
scheme and a 1 percentage point increase in VAT rates. The authorities noted that most of
the measures in the menu were being considered in a comprehensive revenue reform agenda
that could be put into effect in early 2012, when a new administration takes over. They also
acknowledged that securing political support for a revenue reform will be challenging, and
that it was difficult to commit to a precise timing for submitting it to Congress. The mission
stressed the importance of strengthening tax administration in advance of the tax policy
reform to enhance its effectiveness.

there are indications that the quetzal may still be somewhat overvalued (Box 2). In this
context, increasing exchange rate flexibility would be instrumental to safeguard external
competitiveness. Competitiveness would also be enhanced by further deepening economic
integration, reforming the corporate framework, and improving the business environment. In
this regard, the mission suggested focusing on improving public security, simplifying the
procedures required to start a business, reducing the costs of cross-border trading, and
protecting property rights. Improving the framework for public-private partnerships would
also contribute to boost investment in infrastructure.

The external sustainability approach
also indicates that the quetzal may be
mildly overvalued. Guatemala would
need a current account deficit of
3.3 percent of GDP to stabilize its net
foreign asset position (excluding foreign
direct investment). With an underlying
current account deficit of 4½ percent of
GDP, the exchange rate depreciation
needed to close the gap is about
6 percent.

The nominal exchange rate depreciation of 2009 helped
reverse the REER's upward spike of 2008.

1989Q1



The equilibrium exchange rate
approach (ERER) suggests a moderate
overvaluation. Cointegration analysis
gives evidence of a long run relationship
between the REER and the terms of
trade, openness, government
consumption, and the net foreign asset
position.1 While the REER is within the
confidence bands around its estimated
equilibrium value, the ERER approach
suggests an overvaluation of 13 percent
as of mid-2009 (compared to
about 20 percent at end-2008).

Two approaches to assess the exchange

1995Q1

While fundamentals drove most of the
appreciation, there were signs of a mild
overvaluation at end-June 2009. Much of
Guatemala’s REER appreciation is explained
by favorable population dynamics, terms of
trade gains, and government consumption. In
addition, a high pass-through of the 2008
global food and fuel price shock into
domestic prices led to an upward spike in the
REER, which is now reversing.

Sources: Guatemalan authorities, and Fund staff

The macroeconomic balance approach
suggests that the quetzal is fairly valued. Guatemala’s underlying current account of -4½ percent
of GDP falls within its current account norm of -4 to -5 percent of GDP (estimated using the three
different parameter sets given in the CGER exercise).

26.
Staff welcomed the authorities’ efforts to enhance the monetary policy
framework. It reviewed the steps to develop the inflation-targeting framework that have
been taken in recent years (e.g. monitoring inflation expectations, improving the models for
inflation forecasting, and allowing greater exchange rate flexibility). There was agreement
that communications with market participants have improved, thus contributing to
strengthening the expectations channel by clarifying the goals of monetary policy. Staff
noted that efforts to continue increasing exchange rate flexibility would encourage agents to
better internalize risks, helping reduce dollarization and enhancing the channels of
transmission of monetary policy. With Fund technical assistance, the authorities have
strengthened the interest rate channel during the last year. In particular, the central bank has
reduced its number of auctions, merged auction methods and began issuing only standard
maturity instruments. However, the mission and the authorities agreed that the interest rate
channel remains weak due to the excess liquidity in the system and a yield curve that
imperfectly reflects the current and expected stance of monetary policy. To further enhance
the interest rate channel, the authorities will continue:


Developing public debt and private securities markets, by fostering primary and
secondary markets through the acceptance of market-driven pricing, by encouraging
trading of benchmarks to assist in developing a yield curve, and improving market
infrastructure by adopting a comprehensive public debt law.



Enhancing monetary operations, by implementing a transitional framework until
conditions are adequate to adopt an overnight interest rate as the policy rate;
improving liquidity forecasting; and reinforcing the front office and monetary
operations department of the central bank.

Further Strengthening the Financial Sector
27.
There was agreement that the financial sector has been strengthened since 2006
(Figure 6). The authorities stressed that supervision and regulation have improved, including
with the shift to risk-based and on-site supervision; increased specialization of supervision
agents; and the issuance of regulations defining more clearly the components of financial
groups’ capital, and applying credit concentration limits and liquidity requirements to
offshore banks. Together with temporary measures to provide liquidity, those measures have
increased the resilience of the banking sector. Banks’ solvency also has been bolstered,
including through the gradual increase of provisioning requirements to ensure full
provisioning of NPLs by 2011 and the recapitalization of the state-owned mortgage bank by
the government.
28.
Key elements of the financial sector reform agenda are yet to be implemented.
The strategy to strengthen further the financial sector depends on the approval and
implementation of the amendments to the banking law (submitted to Congress in June 2009).

This legislation will allow to reduce risks from offshore operations and connected lending,
strengthen the instruments and size of the banking sector safety net, enhance the enforcement
power of the Superintendency, and improve resolution procedures (IMF Country Report
No. 09/305). It is also essential to finalize contingency plans to enhance crisis preparedness
and the regulations on liquidity and foreign-currency credit management. The authorities are
also working with Congress to help ensure prompt approval of the amendments to the law on
insurance companies, which was submitted two years ago.
29.
The mission discussed with the authorities preliminary lessons from the global
financial crisis and their relevance for financial sector supervision in Guatemala. There
was agreement on the need to further strengthen the regulatory framework, including by
broadening the perimeter of regulation to credit cooperatives and, later on, to the still
incipient securities market. The authorities noted that the amendments to the banking law are
a first step to addressing the procyclicality of banking indicators, as the Superintendency can
prevent banks with inadequate capital or liquidity positions to distribute dividends. They also
stressed that continued progress had been made in strengthening cross-border and
consolidated supervision of regional banking groups, including through efforts to harmonize
legislation and periodical monitoring.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
30.
There are signs that the Guatemalan economy is beginning to recover from the
global crisis. Despite the economic slowdown, domestic and external stability has been
maintained. Output growth and inflation are gradually picking up, imports have begun to
recover, net private capital flows have stabilized, and international reserves are higher than at
end-2008. The financial system remains resilient.
31.
Strong policy implementation has helped preserve macroeconomic stability and
mitigate the impact of the external shock on growth. Investor confidence and financial
stability have been maintained partly as a result of the supportive but prudent
macroeconomic policy stance. Pushing ahead reforms to further strengthen the financial
sector, and refocusing public expenditures toward social and infrastructure spending in a
context of a Fund-supported program, also helped bolster confidence. Macroeconomic
performance under the precautionary SBA has been very strong, with the authorities meeting
all quantitative performance criteria for the second review.
32.
The near-term outlook is for a gradual recovery and downside risks have
declined. The stabilization of global and domestic financial conditions have reduced risks of
sudden private capital outflows or a disorderly depreciation of the quetzal. However,
Guatemala’s close ties to the region and the United States (through trade, the banking system,
and remittances) suggest that downside risks could materialize if the incipient U.S. recovery
falters.

21
33.
Fiscal policy is striking an appropriate balance between supporting demand and
safeguarding debt sustainability. Looking ahead, however, the scope for maintaining a
positive fiscal impulse will be very limited. A continued rise in public debt would put upward
pressures on interest rates and hinder growth. Seeking consensus to increase revenues to
stabilize the public debt-to-GDP ratio over the medium term is therefore critical.
34.
A comprehensive revenue reform is key to allow for the needed increase in
public investment and social spending to boost growth, without compromising fiscal
sustainability. Increasing government revenues is instrumental to address long-standing
weaknesses in education, health, security, and infrastructure through higher public
investment and social spending. Productivity gains also would be necessary to sustain high
growth, including through deepening economic integration, improving the corporate
restructuring framework, and enhancing the business environment.
35.
The gradual lowering of interest rates and the flexible exchange rate has helped
cushion the impact of the global crisis. Monetary policy is expected to remain vigilant,
adjusting the policy rate as needed, and continue improving communications with the market.
This will be key to meet the challenge of anchoring inflation expectations around the
inflation target. The authorities remain committed to maintaining a flexible exchange rate. To
continue developing public and private securities markets and enhancing monetary
operations will be essential to strengthen the interest rate channel of monetary transmission.
36.
Advancing the banking sector reform agenda is critical. Supervision and
regulation have improved and the banking sector has been resilient in the face of the global
crisis, partly due to the prompt adoption of liquidity mechanisms, continued on-site
supervision and tighter provisioning requirements. Congressional approval of the
amendments to the banking law, and their effective implementation will be key to address
risks from offshore operations and connected lending, strengthen the instruments and size of
the banking sector safety net and improve resolution procedures. Implementing the
regulations on liquidity and foreign credit management is crucial to induce banks to compute
liquidity gaps at different maturities and reduce the risks associated with dollarization.
37.
Staff recommends completion of the second review under the SBA. Performance
under the program has been strong and the authorities remain committed to maintaining
macroeconomic stability. As risks to the outlook have declined, staff proposes to modify the
frequency of program reviews from quarterly to semiannual, while maintaining quarterly test
dates and purchases. In light of the benign inflation outlook, staff also proposes lowering the
inflation consultation bands. Staff also proposes revising upwards the performance criterion
on the overall fiscal deficit for end-March 2010, to help avoid slowing down spending
execution during the first semester.
38.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held in accordance with
the July 15, 2002 decision on consultation cycles.

1/ Central Government.
2/ Derived as [(r - g - g + r]/(1+g++g)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate;  = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;  = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and  = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as (1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

Attachment I. Letter of Intent
Guatemala City, November 20, 2009
Mr. Dominique Strauss-Kahn
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C., 20431
Dear Mr. Strauss-Kahn:
1.
The Stand-By Arrangement agreed in April 2009 continues to be implemented
successfully. All end-September quantitative performance criteria have been met (Table 1). The
targets on net international reserves and the overall deficit of the central government were met by
a wide margin. Government deposits at the central bank were above the indicative target for endSeptember. Consumer price inflation stood at zero percent (year-over-year) as of endSeptember 2009, within the inner band agreed under the program.
2.
The Guatemalan economy has been affected by the global crisis, but has proved to be
more resilient than neighboring countries. Moderately countercyclical fiscal and monetary
policies have helped mitigate the effects of the economic slowdown and protect the neediest
segments of the population, while preserving macroeconomic and financial stability. At present,
Guatemala’s economy is recovering. Exports, remittances, and net private capital flows are
stabilizing, and imports are picking up. We remain confident that economic growth will be
moderately positive in 2009 and rise to within a range of 1.3 to 2.1 percent in 2010.
3.
The proposed fiscal stance for the remainder of 2009 and 2010 strikes an appropriate
balance between supporting domestic demand and keeping public debt dynamics in check. We
are maintaining the target for the fiscal deficit of the central government in 2009 at 3.4 percent of
GDP and aim for a deficit of about 3.0 percent of GDP in 2010. The deficit of the consolidated
public sector is expected to reach 3.0 percent of GDP in 2009 and about 2.6 percent of GDP
in 2010. The deficits will be partly financed from external sources, mainly from multilaterals.
4.
We remain firmly committed to maintaining medium-term fiscal sustainability. While tax
revenues may pick up in line with the economic recovery, we are aware that an additional effort
is needed to reduce the fiscal deficit to pre-crisis levels and stabilize debt dynamics. Thus, to
ensure an adequate provision of public goods, we will seek support to increase public revenues to
gradually fulfill the goals of the 1996 Peace Accords.
5.
As inflation and inflation expectations declined, the Monetary Board reduced the policy
interest rate by an additional 25 basis points in September (275 basis points since end-2008) to
4.50 percent. We foresee a benign inflation outlook in the near term and have revised our
inflation projections to below 1 percent by end-2009 and 4 percent by end-2010. The revised
quarterly consultation bands for CPI inflation under the program are consistent with these

33
projections. Monetary policy will continue to focus on meeting the inflation target in the context
of a flexible exchange rate regime. Intervention in the foreign exchange market will remain
geared at smoothing out excessive volatility, while allowing for movements driven by
fundamentals. We expect international reserves to remain at comfortable levels.
6.
Our financial system has been resilient to the economic slowdown. We will continue
strengthening the regulatory framework, including by finalizing new regulations on banks’
liquidity management and foreign currency credit risk by end-December 2009, with their
implementation beginning in the first quarter of 2010. We will maintain our close dialogue with
Congress to seek approval of the amendments to the banking legislation in the first semester
of 2010, which is at the core of our strategy to strengthen further the banking sector.
7.
In light of this performance and our continued commitment to the program, we request
completion of the second review under the Stand-By Arrangement. Our intention is to continue
treating the arrangement as precautionary. To help avoid slowing down spending execution
during the first semester of 2010, we request revising upwards the performance criterion on the
overall fiscal deficit for end-March 2010. Given the inflation outlook, we also request lowering
the inflation consultation bands for end-December 2009 and for end-March and end-June 2010.
Moreover, since risks to the program have declined, we ask for program implementation to be
monitored through semiannual reviews, while maintaining quarterly test dates and purchases. We
also request bringing forward to February 15, 2010 the fourth purchase that becomes available
subject to relevant conditions, including observance of end-December performance criteria. The
quarterly performance criteria (including new performance criteria for June 2010), inflation
consultation clause, and indicative targets under the program are set out in Table 1.
8.
We believe that the policies set forth in this letter, which supplements our letter and the
attached Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) of April 13, 2009, as well as
our letter of September 4, 2009, are adequate to meet the objectives of our economic program.
We stand ready to take additional measures that may be needed for this purpose and will
maintain the usual close and proactive policy dialogue with the Fund.
Sincerely yours,

Attachment II. Technical Memorandum of Understanding
1.
This technical memorandum of understanding (TMU) updates and replaces the
TMU included in the IMF Board document for the April 2009 Stand-By Arrangement
(IMF Country Report No. 09/143). It describes the understandings reached between the
authorities of Guatemala and IMF staff for the monitoring of performance during the requested
18-month Stand-By Arrangement. The TMU describes the quarterly quantitative performance
criteria and corresponding adjusters, the indicative target, the consultation clause on inflation,
and reporting requirements.
I. Quantitative Performance Criteria
A. Overall Balance of the Central Government
2.
The overall balance of the central government is measured on an accrual basis from
above the line. It is defined as the difference in total revenue and total expenditure as defined in
Guatemala’s Budget Law. The information on revenue and expenditure will be obtained from the
public sector accounting system (SICOIN).
3.
At the time of the reviews, the authorities and IMF staff will undertake a process of
reconciliation of above-the-line and below-the-line (as defined below) measurements of the
central government deficit, aiming to progressively reduce differences between them.
4.
The below-the-line deficit is defined as net external financing of the central government
(CG) plus net domestic financing of the central government. The net external financing of the
central government is defined as (i) disbursements of external loans plus; (ii) proceeds from the
issues of government bonds abroad minus; (iii) amortization payments minus; (iv) debt buybacks or any other prepayments of debt. Net domestic financing is defined as (i) the net increase
in the stock of domestic central government bonds minus; (ii) net changes in the stock of
deposits of the National Treasury at the central bank and commercial banks plus; (iii) net
changes in other liabilities of the central government; and minus (iv) net changes in other assets
of the central government.
5.
Adjuster. The floor on the overall balance of the CG for 2009 has been calculated
assuming net external financing totaling US$637 million (Q5093 million at an exchange rate of
Q8 per dollar). If net external financing exceeds that level, the floor will be adjusted downwards
by up to US$100 million (Q800 million).
B. Net International Reserves (NIR) of the Central Bank
For the purpose of the program, the stock of NIR of the Central Bank is defined as
6.
the difference between the U.S. dollar value of gross liquid foreign assets, and short-term foreign
liabilities as defined below.

36
7.
The definition of gross foreign assets and net foreign assets should be consistent with
the Data Template on International Reserves and Foreign Currency Liquidity and the fifth
edition of the Balance of Payments Manual (BPM5).


Gross reserve assets include monetary gold, holdings of SDRs, any reserve position in
the Fund, and holdings of foreign exchange in convertible currencies. Excluded from
gross reserve assets are capital participation in IFIs, any assets in nonconvertible
currencies, holdings of precious metals other than monetary gold, encumbered reserve
assets, reserve assets pledged as collateral for foreign loans, reserve assets pledged
through forward contracts, and illiquid assets.



Short-term foreign liabilities of the central bank are defined as the sum of (i) all foreign
currency-denominated liabilities of the central bank with an original maturity of one year
or less; (ii) liabilities to the Fund; (iii) any foreign currency liabilities of the central bank
to residents, including financial institutions; and (iv) any short-term liability converted
into a medium-term liability during the program period.



As per these definitions, on March 23, 2009, gross foreign assets of the central bank
stood at US$5046 million and NIR stood at US$4781 million.
C. Nonaccumulation of External Arrears

8.
Guatemala will maintain its stated policy of not incurring external payment arrears.
This performance criterion applies on a continuous basis. For the purposes of this performance
criterion, an external debt payment arrear will be defined as a payment by the central government
which has not been made within seven days after falling due under the contractual agreement,
unless specified otherwise.
II. Indicative Target
9.
Central Government deposits at the Bank of Guatemala are defined as all the
account balances of the central government held at the Bank of Guatemala, currently under the
summary account 22106001.5
III. Consultation Clause
10.
Reflecting the Bank of Guatemala’s inflation targeting approach to monetary
policy, quarterly consultation bands of +/– 2 percentage points (inner band) and +/– 3 percentage
points (outer band) are established around the projected 12-month rate of inflation in consumer
prices (LOI Table 1). Inflation will be measured by the 12-month rate of change of the headline
5

The authorities will inform IMF staff in case the account number of the central government at the Bank of
Guatemala changed or other accounts had to be taken into consideration for the purpose of assessing compliance
with the indicative targets established in the program.

37
consumer price index (IPC - Indice de precios al consumidor), as published by the National
Statistics Institute (INE).
11.
Should the 12-month rate of IPC inflation fall outside the inner band specified above, the
authorities will discuss with Fund staff on the policy response. Should the 12-month rate of IPC
inflation exceed the upper limit of the outer band specified above, the authorities will also
consult with the IMF Executive Board prior to resuming their purchases.
IV. Reporting requirements
12.
The authorities will provide the necessary information to the Fund staff to monitor
the program in an adequate manner, in particular as it refers to the following specific daily,
weekly, and monthly data with a delay not exceeding the indicated lag. The Bank of Guatemala
and the Ministry of Finance will send the information by e-mail, or by fax if electronic delivery
is impossible.
13.
In addition, timely information will be provided to the Fund on economic and
financial measures taken by the government, as well as changes in legislation including
regulations approved by the Central Bank of Guatemala, the Ministry of Finance, the
superintendency of banks, the SAT, and other key economic agencies.

Safeguards Assessment

Under the Fund’s safeguards assessment policy, the Bank of Guatemala was subject to an
assessment with respect to the Stand-By Arrangement, which was approved on April 22, 2009
(IMF Country Report No. 09/143). The assessment, which was completed in September 2009,
found that the Bank of Guatemala has strengthened safeguards in the areas of financial reporting
transparency and the management of foreign exchange reserves. Recommendations were made
to further strengthen the bank’s governance and independence.

3
VIII.

Exchange Rate Arrangements

Since March 1994, Guatemala has had an arrangement based on an interbank foreign exchange
market in which authorized financial institutions buy and sell foreign exchange at marketdetermined rates. Financial institutions authorized to operate in the foreign exchange market
include commercial banks, finance companies, and exchange houses. The exchange regime is
classified as “Floating.” As of November 18, 2009, the reference exchange rate was Q8.30 per
U.S. dollar.
IX.

Last Article IV Consultation

The last Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on May 19, 2008.
X.

FSAP Participation

An FSAP was conducted on July 3–7, 2000 and on September 11–23, 2000, and the Financial
System Stability Assessment was discussed by the Executive Board on May 14, 2001 at the time
of the 2001 Article IV consultation. An FSAP update was undertaken during October 27–
November 10, 2005.
XI.

Technical Assistance

Technical assistance provided in recent years has covered tax policy administration, expenditure
management, inflation targeting, financial sector regulation and supervision, and statistics.
Since 2004, FAD has provided assistance on tax policy, expenditure management, and tax
administration in various missions. STA has also assisted in completing General Data
Dissemination System metadata for the financial and external sector, and in improving statistics
on the balance of payments, the national accounts, and government financial statistics. In
July 2009, a STA mission provided technical assistance on quarterly national accounts. MCM
has provided assistance on inflation targeting, monitoring the banking system, and improving
banking sector regulation and supervision. During March 2008–May 2009, three advisory
missions assisted in designing an action plan for the development of secondary markets for
private securities and improving the efficiency and effectiveness of monetary policy.
A regional Technical Assistance Center for Central America, Panama, and the Dominican
Republic (CAPTAC-DR), started operations in June 2009. CAPTAC-DR, which is based in
Guatemala City, will deliver capacity-building and training to seven countries in the region,
supporting the implementation of the countries’ development strategies in IMF areas of
expertise. The center will also provide technical assistance (TA) at the regional and national
level in support of ongoing economic and financial integration efforts in the region. TA is
already being provided to Guatemala on revenue administration as well as on issues related to
the planned customs union between Guatemala and El Salvador.

Appendix II. Guatemala—Relations with the World Bank Group
(As of October 31, 2009)
The Bank’s Country Partnership Strategy for Guatemala. The Bank’s Country Partnership
Strategy (CPS) for the period FY09–12 was developed in close collaboration with the
government and wide consultation with country stakeholders. The CPS was discussed by the
Bank’s Executive Board in September 2008 and supports growth and poverty reduction
strategies within the government’s development program, Plan de la Esperanza. The CPS
supports key elements of Guatemala’s program, including a new conditional cash transfer
program, policies to support natural disaster risk mitigation, fiscal reform, rural infrastructure
development, and other poverty reduction efforts.
IBRD Flows and Total Debt Outstanding. IBRD disbursements to Guatemala have increased
in recent years, rising from an annual average of about US$90 million during 2003–06 to an
average of some US$160 million during 2007–09. Guatemala’s total debt outstanding to the
IBRD was US$967.1 million as of end-October 2009.
The current portfolio. As of October 31, 2009, the IBRD active portfolio consisted of
8 projects with a total commitment of US$752.8 million and net disbursements of
US$71.4 million. These comprise six investment loans, one Catastrophic Development Policy
Loan with Deferred Draw-down Option (CAT DPL-DDO), and one Development Policy Loan
(DPL).
The Second Programmatic Fiscal and Institutional Development Policy Loan (DPL) for
$350 million, approved by the Board of Directors on July 28, 2009, is part of a series developed
within Guatemala’s medium-term development plan and is designed to: (i) enhance
macroeconomic stability, governance, and transparency; (ii) expand opportunities for vulnerable
groups through improved targeting of social programs; and (iii) promote sustainable growth and
productivity for better jobs.

Appendix III. Guatemala—Relations with the Inter-American Development Bank
(As of November 2009)
A. Recent Projects and Objectives
1.
On June 30, 2009, the IADB approved its country strategy for Guatemala for 2008–2011.
The country strategy was the product of dialogue with the current Guatemalan administration. It
focuses on supporting the following government goals: (i) reducing chronic malnutrition;
(ii) reducing the intergenerational transmission of poverty; (iii) upgrading and maintaining
production infrastructure; and (iv) achieving the revenue collection targets established in the
Peace Accords.
2.
As of November 10, 2009, the IADB portfolio of approved sovereign-guaranteed
investment and policy-based loans under execution amounted to US$1,440 million, with an
undisbursed balance of US$875.5 million. The existing portfolio focuses on: (i) supporting the
reform and modernization of the State (including a policy-based loan targeted to support the
government’s efforts in modernizing its fiscal system); (ii) strengthening the country’s social
programs (including a policy-based loan directed to support a conditional cash transfer program
and a performance-driven loan to contribute to the implementation of the country’s education
policy); and (iii) improving productive infrastructure (especially in the rural areas and in the
water and sanitation sector).
3.
In the private sector, over the last two years, the IADB has approved one lending facility
for the financial sector (US$45 million) and two credit line operations for trade financing
(US$75 million).
4.
The pipeline includes projects in the areas of health and nutrition and water and
sanitation. In addition, the Bank continues to support nonfinancial activities, including
assistance in the area of fiscal reform, health and nutrition, education, water and sanitation, and
public sector strengthening.

Appendix IV. Guatemala—Statistical Issues
Guatemala―Statistical Issues Appendix
As of November 2009
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is adequate for surveillance.
National Accounts: quarterly national accounts data are not available, but the Bank of
Guatemala expects to publish quarterly GDP statistics at end-2009. STA has provided
technical assistance and is working closely with the Bank of Guatemala in the development
of quarterly GDP estimates.
Price statistics: a producer price index (PPI) is not compiled. The National Institute of
Statistics is planning to develop a PPI in the medium term, subject to resource availability.
Public sector data: fiscal statistics do not include social security agencies, local
governments, and nonfinancial public enterprises, hindering the calculation of a
consolidated public sector balance.
Financial sector data: The sectorization of some instruments on the balance sheet of other
depositary corporations is pending. In particular, for loans, there is no classification
available between nonresidents and residents.
II. Data Standards and Quality
A data ROSC was completed on
Guatemala became a participant in the
October 28, 2004.
General Data Dissemination System
(GDDS) in 2004, and is interested in
subscribing to the Special Data
Dissemination Standard (SDDS). Several
data categories are yet to meet the
periodicity or timeliness requirements
prescribed by SDDS. An SDDS
assessment mission is scheduled in 2010 to
address these issues.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
December 16, 2009
1.
This statement summarizes information that has become available since the issuance
of the Staff Report (EBS/09/186). The new information does not alter the thrust of the staff
appraisal.
2.
Economic activity continues to recover and inflation remains low. In October, the
monthly index of economic activity (IMAE) increased 0.2 percent (m/m seasonally adjusted).
In November, monthly inflation was 0.05 percent and annual inflation was -0.6 percent. As a
result, inflation could be close to zero at end-2009 (compared to 0.8 percent in EBS/09/186).
3.
The government failed to garner the majority in Congress to approve the
draft 2010 budget by end-November and, thus, expenditure in 2010 will be guided by
the 2009 budget. According to the Guatemalan constitution, a budget can no longer be
approved after end-November, in which case expenditure must be guided by the previous
year’s budget. The 2009 budget has an expenditure ceiling of Q47.5 billion, which is
Q1.9 billion (0.6 percent of GDP) higher than the ceiling in the draft 2010 budget. If the 2009
budget’s expenditure is fully executed in 2010, and given revenue projected at Q35.5 billion,
the fiscal deficit would reach Q12.1 billion (3.7 percent of GDP), exceeding the Q10 billion
deficit target (3.1 percent of GDP) agreed under the SBA.
4.
However, the authorities remain fully committed to the 2010 fiscal deficit agreed
under the SBA, which envisages a slightly negative fiscal impulse. A tighter fiscal policy
stance could weaken demand and hinder the incipient economic recovery. Yet, the balance of
risks is tilted toward a lower fiscal deficit than the program target, for three reasons:


Expenditure execution is likely to be contained. The authorities have indicated that
they will execute expenditure only up to the ceiling of the 2010 draft budget. There is
no legal impediment to do so.



The amount of borrowing to be approved by Congress is uncertain. The 2010
draft budget envisaged new borrowing for Q9 billion, about half of which was to be
approved together with the budget bill. However, Congress now needs to approve a
law to finance expenditure plans for 2010. If the borrowing authorization is lower
than Q4.5 billion, the 2010 fiscal deficit could be below the program target.
Moreover, potential delays in approving the needed borrowing could severely affect
the execution of the public investment program in the first semester.



The usage of the revenue package currently being considered by Congress
(see ¶15 in EBS/09/186) might be changed. If Congress decided to channel part of
the proceeds of the revenue package to finance the deficit rather than to increase
spending levels, the deficit could be lower than envisaged under the program.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2009 Article IV Consultation with
Guatemala
On December 16, 2009, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Guatemala.1
Background
The Guatemalan economy was negatively affected by the global crisis, but there are signs
that the economy is beginning to recover. After growing 5.8 percent during 2006–07, on
average, economic growth decelerated to 4.0 percent in 2008 and continued to slow down
in 2009. The global crisis affected the Guatemalan economy through a decline in exports,
remittances, tourism receipts, and net private capital inflows. Annual inflation fell to
-0.6 percent in October, from 9.4 percent at end-2008, reflecting weak demand and the
decline in commodity prices. Despite the external shock, domestic and external stability have
been preserved and the authorities are treating an 18-month Stand-By Arrangement as
precautionary.2
The authorities’ economic policies in 2009 have aimed at safeguarding macroeconomic
stability and mitigating the impact of the global crisis. The authorities’ strategy has consisted
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

The 18-month Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) with total access of SDR630.6 million (about
US$986 million) was approved in April 2009.

2
in adopting moderately countercyclical policies, maintaining exchange rate flexibility,
advancing reforms to further strengthen the financial sector, and refocusing public
expenditures toward social and infrastructure spending (as set out in the National Program of
Emergency and Economic Recovery).
Fiscal policy has struck a reasonable balance between supporting demand and preserving
public debt sustainability. The fiscal deficit of the central government reached 1.4 percent of
gross domestic product (GDP) in January–September of 2009 due to a decline in revenues of
about 7.5 percent and an increase in spending (mainly social and infrastructure expenditure).
The government’s financing requirements were met through domestic bond issuance, use of
government deposits at the central bank, and external loans from multilaterals. At end-2009,
the central government deficit is expected to reach 3.4 percent of GDP, up from 1.6 percent
of GDP in 2008.
Monetary conditions were eased gradually in 2009 to support the economic recovery and
avoid disorderly adjustments in the exchange rate. As inflationary pressures eased, the
central bank reduced its policy interest rate by 275 basis points to 4.50 percent (7.25 percent
at end-2008). The nominal exchange rate has depreciated by 6½ percent since end-2008,
contributing to cushion the impact of the global crisis. The central bank has intervened
occasionally to smooth exchange rate volatility.
Despite the economic slowdown, the financial sector has remained sound. In the face of the
global crisis, several measures were adopted to reduce the risks to the financial system,
including continuous onsite supervision, temporary and enhanced liquidity provisioning
mechanisms, and tighter provisioning requirements. While nonperforming loans have risen
and profitability declined, liquidity and solvency ratios have remained adequate. As banks’
deposits are growing and credit is stagnant, overall liquidity is ample, inducing banks to repay
foreign credit lines.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for their strong performance under the Fundsupported program, which has helped preserve macroeconomic stability and mitigate the
impact of the global crisis. Directors welcomed the prospect of a gradual recovery and the
declining downside risks as global financial conditions stabilize. They noted nevertheless that
Guatemala’s near-term outlook is subject to the pace of recovery in the United States, calling
for continued vigilance. Over the longer term, raising growth and reducing poverty while
safeguarding fiscal sustainability require a comprehensive strategy, including measures to
raise revenues and structural reforms aimed at enhancing the business environment.
Directors emphasized that fiscal policy should continue to strike a balance between
supporting domestic demand and keeping public debt dynamics in check. They endorsed the
authorities’ deficit target of 3.1 percent of GDP for 2010 and called on them to continue
working with Congress to ensure prompt approval of a law to finance the expenditure plans.
To stabilize the public debt-to-GDP ratio and to address long-standing weaknesses in

3
education, health, security, and infrastructure, it will be important to strengthen tax
administration and implement a comprehensive package of revenue-enhancing measures.
Directors supported the gradual easing of monetary policy. They encouraged the authorities
to remain vigilant in their conduct of monetary policy, standing ready to adjust the policy rate
as needed, and to continue improving communications with the market in order to anchor
better inflation expectations. Directors stressed the need to strengthen the interest rate
channel of monetary transmission, by further developing public and private securities markets
and enhancing monetary operations.
Directors welcomed the commitment to a flexible exchange rate, pointing to its crucial role in
cushioning the impact of external shocks and strengthening the credibility of the inflationtargeting framework. They noted the staff’s assessment that the real effective exchange rate
may be somewhat overvalued, and supported the authorities’ intention to limit intervention in
the foreign exchange market to smoothing out excessive volatility, allowing exchange rate
movements to be driven by fundamentals. Directors encouraged the authorities to press
ahead with structural reforms aimed at improving external competitiveness.
Directors emphasized that advancing the banking sector reform agenda remains a high
priority. Recent efforts to strengthen supervision and regulation of the financial sector have
contributed to its resilience in the face of the global crisis. Congressional approval and
decisive implementation of the proposed amendments to the banking law would help reduce
risks from offshore operations and connected lending, enhance the enforcement power of
supervisors, and improve bank resolution procedures. Directors welcomed plans to
implement regulations on liquidity and foreign credit management in early 2010.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Washington, D.C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Completes Second Review Under Stand-By Arrangement with
Guatemala
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on December 16th completed
the second review of Guatemala’s economic performance under a program supported by an
18-month Stand-By Arrangement (SBA). The Guatemalan authorities intend to continue
treating the arrangement as precautionary.
The arrangement, in the amount of SDR 630.6 million (about US$986 million) was approved
on April 22, 2009 (see Press Release No. 09/142). With completion of the review, a total of
SDR 504.48 million (about US$789 million) is available for drawing.
The Executive Board also approved a modification of a performance criterion and the
inflation consultation clause. In particular, the overall fiscal deficit for end-March 2010 was
revised upwards to provide room for spending to support the incipient recovery and the
inflation consultation band was adjusted downwards in view of the benign inflation outlook.
As risks to the program have declined, program reviews will now take place on a semiannual
basis instead of on a quarterly schedule, while maintaining quarterly performance criteria.
Following the Executive Board’s discussion on Guatemala, Mr. Murilo Portugal, Deputy
Managing Director and Acting Chair, stated:
“The Guatemalan economy is beginning to recover from the global crisis and growth is
expected to be higher than the regional average. The authorities’ prudent policies have helped
maintain macroeconomic stability and mitigate the effects of the economic slowdown. These
include moderately counter-cyclical monetary and fiscal policies, exchange rate flexibility,
reorientation of expenditures toward social and infrastructure spending, and strengthening of
financial sector supervision and regulation. Continued steadfast implementation of this
program will help preserve confidence and further increase the economy’s resilience to
potential shocks.

In the near term, fiscal policy is expected to continue to strike a balance between supporting
domestic demand and safeguarding debt sustainability. Approval of a law to finance the
government’s expenditure plans for 2010 would help avoid delaying necessary outlays. Over
the medium term, it will be critical to boost growth by addressing weaknesses in education,
health, security, and infrastructure. Financing the needed increase in public investment and
social spending requires a comprehensive revenue-enhancing reform.
The authorities have eased the monetary policy stance prudently, helping to avoid disorderly
exchange rate movements. It is important to remain vigilant, adjusting the policy rate as
needed. Further development of public and private securities markets and enhancement of
monetary operations would help strengthen the interest rate channel of monetary policy
transmission. The authorities remain committed to maintaining a flexible exchange rate.
Important progress has been made in strengthening financial sector supervision and
regulation, but additional efforts are still needed to complete the reform agenda. Priorities
include Congressional approval and implementation of the proposed amendments to the
banking law, and enforcement of the regulations on liquidity and foreign credit management
in early 2010,” Mr. Portugal said.

Statement by Ramón Guzmán, Executive Director for Guatemala
and Johny Gramajo-Marroquín, Senior Advisor
December 16, 2009
We would like to thank the Staff for a helpful and well-written report. The Guatemalan
Authorities broadly agree with the Staff’s assessment and recommendations. Under the
Stand-By Arrangement, all end-September quantitative performance criteria have been met.
The targets on net international reserves and the overall deficit of the central government
were met by a wide margin. Government deposits at the central bank were above the
indicative target for end-September. Annual inflation stood at zero percent as of endSeptember, within the inner consultation band. Our Authorities reiterate that they continue
treating the arrangement as precautionary and their commitment to the program remains
strong.
Recent developments. The global crisis has had a negative impact on Guatemala, even
though it experienced modest positive economic growth, in contrast to the performance of
neighboring countries. There are signs that the Guatemalan economy has started to recover
from the global crisis, reflected in recent exports trend, stabilization of remittances and net
private capital flows, a pick up in imports, and adequate levels of liquidity and capitalization
in the financial system; situation that reflects the economy’s resilience to the global crisis.
The fiscal and monetary policies stances have helped to mitigate the economic slowdown and
protect the poorest segments of the population, while preserving macroeconomic and
financial stability.
Near-term outlook. Our authorities remain confident that economic growth will be modestly
positive in 2009 and rise to within a range of 1.3 to 2.1 percent in 2010. The external
economic and financial conditions have stabilized, reducing the country’s exposure to
external shocks. However, due to Guatemala’s close links with the United States, downside
risks could materialize if the U.S. economic recovery is weaker than envisaged.
Fiscal policy. During 2009, the authorities were able to implement a mildly countercyclical
fiscal policy. Expenditure on social programs and on investment in infrastructure increased
and contributed to Guatemala’s modest but positive economic growth in spite of the crisis.
We are of the view that the current fiscal stance and the one proposed for 2010 strike an
appropriate balance between providing a necessary stimulus to domestic demand and keeping
public debt dynamics manageable, while protecting social spending. The central government
deficit is expected to reach 3.4 percent of GDP by year-end, and about 3.0 percent of GDP in
2010. The consolidated public sector deficit is expected to reach 3.0 percent of GDP in 2009
and about 2.6 percent of GDP in 2010. Those deficits will be partially financed with external
sources, mostly from multilateral institutions.

Notwithstanding the proposed budget for 2010 was not approved by Congress and
recognizing that this situation poses a complex scenario for public finances (mainly due to
uncertainty in the financing sources, including placement of a US$500 million bond in
international markets, since the budget to be implemented is the current one for 2009), our
authorities remain firmly committed to the program objectives (especially the fiscal deficit
targets) and to maintain medium-term fiscal sustainability. While tax revenues may pick up
in line with the economic recovery, the authorities are aware that an additional effort is
needed to reduce the fiscal deficit to pre-crisis levels and stabilize debt dynamics. Thus, to
safeguard expenditures in order to ensure an adequate provision of public goods, the fiscal
authority has been seeking support for a gradual increase in public revenues.
Monetary policy. As inflation and inflation expectations declined, the Monetary Board has
reduced the policy interest rate by 275 basis points to 4.50 percent. Our authorities foresee a
benign inflation outlook in the near term and have revised their inflation projections to below
1 percent by end-2009 and 4 percent by end-2010. The revised quarterly consultation bands
for CPI inflation under the Program are consistent with these projections. Monetary policy
will continue to focus on meeting the inflation target in the context of a flexible exchange
rate regime. Thus, intervention in the FX market will remain geared at smoothing out
excessive volatility, while allowing for movements driven by fundamentals.
Financial sector. The Guatemalan financial system has been resilient to the external shock.
The Authorities are committed to further strengthening the regulatory framework. In that
regard, the monetary board approved regulations on banks’ liquidity management and is
discussing foreign currency credit risk regulations with a view to approve them in the next
days. Their implementation will begin in the second quarter of 2010. In addition, the
authorities will continue maintaining a close dialogue with Congress to seek approval of the
submitted amendments to the current banking legislation aimed at further strengthening the
banking sector.
Finally, the Authorities believe that the ongoing policies are adequate to meet the objectives
of their economic program, which has been effectively supported by the Stand-By
Arrangement.
