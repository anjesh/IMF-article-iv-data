Executive Summary
Background
•

The economy continues to perform well as the recovery maintains its momentum and the
authorities adhere to disciplined fiscal and monetary policies. The central government
budget was estimated to be once more in surplus in 2005, as mining and petroleum
revenue remain strong and overall expenditure is kept in check, resulting in a further
reduction in public sector debt.

•

Monetary policy has achieved a favorable combination of relatively low interest rates
and inflation. In response to these conditions, as well as to the more stable political
environment, credit to the private sector has picked up for the first time in four years.
International reserves are strong and the kina remains broadly stable.

•

Mining and gas prospects have improved, but the overall medium-term outlook remains
vulnerable. Structural problems that continue to discourage private activity need to be
addressed, including improving governance, strengthening law and order, upgrading
infrastructure, and simplifying investment regulations.

Key Issues and Policy Discussions
•

The staff supports the authorities’ medium-term development strategy, which aims to
maintain the current stable macroeconomic environment while moving the economy to a
higher sustainable growth path and reducing poverty. The risks remain substantial,
however, including the possibility of increasing spending pressures and slowing
momentum for reform ahead of the 2007 parliamentary elections.

•

The authorities’ medium-term fiscal strategy of budget balance and progressively
reducing public debt relative to GDP is appropriate and feasible. To achieve these
objectives and safeguard progress to date, further reform is needed including extending
expenditure controls more broadly, reducing the wage bill, and improving tax
administration. These steps would also make room for the increased social and capital
expenditure planned to address development needs.

•

On monetary policy, the staff endorsed the central bank’s continuing commitment to
maintaining inflation at a low level, along with the retention of the flexible exchange rate
regime.

•

Further structural reforms are key to higher private activity, greater job creation, and
reduced poverty, the mission and the authorities agreed. The mission pressed for more
rapid action on steps needed to attract private investment.

The current government, led by Prime Minister Sir Michael Somare, has made
strides in addressing the economic challenges that it inherited upon taking office in
2002. It progressively tightened fiscal policy, in tandem with supportive monetary policy, in
a bid to support growth while putting the economy on a more stable footing for the future. As
a result, and aided by improving global commodity price developments, the country’s
economic position has improved and macroeconomic stability has been restored. Real GDP
growth turned positive in 2003, after contracting in the previous three years, and inflation
dropped sharply. The government additionally set out a medium-term development strategy
focusing on economic reform needed to boost growth to a higher sustainable level (Box 2).
3.
The political environment has stabilized in advance of parliamentary elections in
2007. Prime Minister Somare is likely to complete a full five-year term through 2007, the
first time for any government since independence. Installation of an autonomous government
on Bougainville Island in June 2005 appears to have quieted the 15-year conflict there.

BOX 1. Challenges to Growth
Papua New Guinea has experienced volatile growth since 1960, with GDP increasing at an
average annual rate of 5½ percent during 1960–75, then falling to 2.3 percent during 1976–2004.

growth.
More recently Papua New Guinea has met many of the theoretical requisites for stronger
growth, including a more stable political and macroeconomic environment and an open trade
regime, but a longer track record may be needed to change global perceptions.
Available information suggests that other structural factors leading to low total factor
productivity may still underlie the poor growth performance by providing a drag on the
economy. The rugged terrain raises the cost of transportation infrastructure, which remains
weak: less than 4 percent of roads and of airport runways are paved. In addition, adult literacy is
low (66 percent). More generally, governance and law and order issues continue to be
disincentives to investment. Addressing these weaknesses should yield considerable gains for
growth.

Box 2. The Medium-Term Development Strategy
The April 2005 Medium-Term Development Strategy (MTDS) sets out the government’s
development priorities for 2005-2010, which are consistent with their Millennium Development
Goals. The MTDS aims at: (i) establishing good governance; (ii) promoting export-driven growth in
agriculture, forestry, fisheries and tourism; and (iii) accelerating rural development and poverty
reduction. These goals are to be met through:
•

public sector reform through improved accountability, reduced costs, more efficient service
delivery, and fiscal sustainability;

•

a more favorable climate for private sector business through improved law and justice, expanded
telecommunications, development of human resources, and upgraded transportation
infrastructure; and

•

redirecting public expenditure toward the “priority areas” of rural and transportation
infrastructure, basic education, law and justice, and preventive health care programs, including
HIV/AIDS prevention.

Achievement of the fiscal strategy is dependent on firm implementation of the Public Sector Reform
Program and Public Expenditure Review and Rationalization (PERR) to secure savings in lowerpriority budgetary expenditure that can be redirected to priority areas.
The financing of the MTDS was mapped out by the Minister of Finance and Treasury in a mediumterm macroeconomic framework. Growth is expected to rise gradually, reflecting a recovery in the
agricultural and mining sectors. Inflation should remain modest, as prudent fiscal and monetary
policies are maintained and the exchange rate is assumed to be broadly stable. Continued fiscal
restraint is expected to contribute to a further decline in the public debt level.

4.
Australia and Papua New Guinea have reached tentative agreement to revive a
streamlined Enhanced Cooperation Package (ECP). Under the 2003 ECP, Australia
provided personnel to improve the functioning of the judicial system and the police force,
and to assist the finance and treasury departments in improving their budget management,
financial control, and procurement procedures. The ECP was suspended in May 2005 after
the Supreme Court ruled that the immunity granted to the Australian federal police was
unconstitutional. Under the revived proposal, the ECP will shift from a focus on
strengthening law and order to improving governance and reducing corruption. The 30
officials serving as economic advisors to the government will remain in place.
5.
The direction of the authorities’ economic policies has been in line with Fund
advice. A medium-term strategy to foster faster real GDP growth on a sustained basis in
order to raise living standards and alleviate poverty has been formulated and launched. The
medium-term fiscal position has improved with further consolidation and debt reduction, as
urged by Executive Directors. The authorities have maintained the flexible exchange rate

-8-

regime, as recommended, noting that it has been essential in maintaining low inflation while
supporting the economic recovery. With regard to structural reform, the outcome has been
mixed. The public wage bill remains high, though some progress has been made in switching
expenditure resources to priority areas. A controversial proposal in 2004 to borrow externally
on commercial terms was set aside. However, advancement on other longstanding structural
problems needed to promote private sector activity was slower than envisaged, including
addressing weaknesses in governance, law and order, infrastructure, and investment
regulations.
II. THE CURRENT ECONOMIC SETTING
6.
The economy is performing well as the recovery maintains its momentum, the
external position remains healthy, and inflation is low. Real GDP rose by about 3 percent
in 2004, in line with the previous year, and a similar rate of growth is expected for 2005
(Table 1). The mining and agricultural sectors were the initial drivers behind the recovery,
boosted by an upswing in commodity prices and improved weather. Fiscal and monetary
discipline, together with exchange rate appreciation, led to a sharp reduction in average CPI
inflation in 2004 to around 2 percent from 14.7 percent in the preceding year, and inflation is
estimated to average 1 percent in 2005. The external accounts are expected to be in surplus in
2005, buoyed by high commodity prices for minerals and oil, but also reflecting the start of
oil refinery operations and increased non-mineral export volume.

The government continued to consolidate the fiscal position in 2005, with the
projected outcome for the year stronger than budgeted (Table 2). High mineral and nonmineral revenue (buoyed by continued high commodity prices and stronger than expected
growth), and lower than expected expenditure (including on interest payments) generated net
savings for the year of about 5 percentage points of GDP. Under the authorities’ revised
budget, about half of the savings was used to reduce the stock of domestic arrears and
increase spending in priority areas. Another 2.5 percent of GDP of savings were set aside for
a future equity acquisition in the Highlands-Queensland gas pipeline project and recorded as
an expenditure. As a result, the authorities estimated a budget deficit of 0.6 percent compared
to the original budget projection of a deficit of 0.9 percent of GDP. Adjusting for the funds
set aside but not actually spent in 2005, the staff estimates the budget balance to be in a
surplus of about 2.7 percent of GDP.1 The improved fiscal outcome resulted in a further
reduction in total public sector debt, about half of which is external debt, to 49 percent of
GDP in 2005 from 72 percent in 2002.

As monetary policy has been relaxed in line with the tightening of fiscal policy,
credit to the private sector revived while inflation remains low (Table 3). In the absence
of inflationary or exchange rate pressure, the central bank progressively lowered the
signaling Kina Facility Rate from a 16 percent peak in July 2003 to 6 percent in September
2005. Broad money is expected to rise by about 15 percent in 2005, reflecting increased net
foreign assets. In response to lower interest rates, abundant liquidity and more stable
economic and political conditions, private sector credit picked up for the first time in four
years, increasing by about 20 percent from a low base.

1

The other major difference between the authorities’ and the staff’s estimates for the budget in 2005
and 2006 relates to grants and expenditure under the revived ECP. In the staff’s estimates, ECP grants
and expenditure are lower reflecting the reduction in Australian personnel working in Papua New
Guinea.

Over the past two years, the kina has remained roughly unchanged on a real
effective exchange rate basis, while external reserves have increased. The kina
appreciated against the U.S. dollar by about 15 percent in nominal terms during this period,
mainly reflecting strong export receipts along with a gradual restoration of confidence in
economic management. Gross international reserves are expected to close 2005 at 5.5 months
of non-mineral imports (Table 4). External competitiveness appears adequate, given
increased non-mineral export volume and a relatively stable share of Papua New Guinea’s
exports in total world exports. In addition, Papua New Guinea’s aggregate ranking (64 out of
155 countries globally) in the World Bank’s ease of doing business database compares
relatively favorably overall with others in the region.

The authorities have taken steps to improve public sector efficiency and the
investment environment, but overall progress in implementing structural reform has
been slow. Positive steps have been made through the adoption of stricter controls on
recurrent public expenditure. However, advancement of the broader reform of the public
sector was slow, particularly in revenue administration and provincial government
operations. Movement on infrastructure investment and land reform also was limited and
privatization stalled. The financial system overall remains healthy. The financial condition of
the government-owned Rural Development Bank has improved somewhat, but it remains to
be seen whether sufficient measures are in place to avoid a return to past financial
difficulties. Political analysts continue to give poor marks to Papua New Guinea regarding
corruption and quality of the bureaucracy, although the country’s ratings are comparable to
others in the region (Box 1). Relations with the World Bank are strained over governance
questions in connection with loans for forestry management.
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS: GROWTH AND STRUCTURAL REFORM
11.
The consultation discussions focused on the policies needed to maintain the
current stable macroeconomic environment while moving the economy to a higher
sustainable growth path and reducing poverty. To meet this objective, the authorities have
adopted a Medium-Term Development Strategy (MTDS) that targets improved governance,
stronger export-driven growth, and accelerated rural development. The mission endorsed this
strategy, which is based on: (a) an improvement in the outlook for medium-term fiscal
sustainability through public sector reform (Box 3), (b) a continuation of the current low
inflation by maintaining an appropriate monetary stance, and (c) a more vigorous effort on
reform to remove longstanding impediments to private sector development and growth,
including by redirecting public spending toward infrastructure, law and order, education, and
health. However, the discussions also looked at the scope for additional steps, including
measures to strengthen non-mineral revenue and improve the environment for private sector
activity, to help ensure success in achieving the MTDS’s objectives.
A. Medium-Term Outlook: Prospects and Risks
12.
The macroeconomic outlook is positive provided that the authorities continue
their prudent fiscal and monetary policies and progress more rapidly on their
structural reform agenda (Table 5). Growth is expected to rise gradually to about

- 12 -

Box 3. Fiscal Reform to Meet Growth Objectives
A key component of the authorities’ medium-term development strategy to raise growth and
reduce poverty is the Public Sector Reform Program. Key elements include:
• “Right-sizing” the public sector to shift the government’s focus to core business and improve
service delivery; a draft plan and recommendations for overhauling the government’s structure
has been submitted to the cabinet.
• Introducing public expenditure reform to free resources for priority expenditure, including a
gradual reduction in the size of civil service by 10 percent by 2007.
• Improving accountability and compliance by strengthening monitoring and audit systems.
• Continuing the privatization program.
• Strengthening the performance of provincial and local governments.
A detailed action plan for public expenditure reform was provided under the 2004 World Bank-led
Public Expenditure Review and Rationalization (PERR), including:
• Steps to reduce the size of the civil service, including through introduction of a new payroll
system.
• Strengthening budget systems, including through greater transparency and remedial action for
breaches of agreed budgets.
• Detailing expenditure prioritization at an agency or sector level.
• Improving health and education spending.
An August 2005 PERR review found that progress had been made in improved debt management,
greater budget transparency, and higher health and education spending. At the same time, greater
efforts were needed in areas such as:
•
•
•
•
•

Securing control of expenditure, including the payroll.
Benchmarking existing processes to identify next steps needed and monitor progress.
Further strengthening transparency and accountability.
Strengthening leadership and management.
Improving capacity of managers and individual staff.

4.5 percent by 2010, as private activity responds to improved macroeconomic policies and
structural reform and new mineral projects come on line only toward the end of the forecast
period (Box 4). Sustained real growth on this order would represent a break from past poor
performance; given the current rate of population growth, the annual real per capita growth
rates would be over 2 percent. A more rapid rate of economic growth would require a
stronger effort to address structural factors impeding growth. Inflation should remain
subdued below 4 percent annually.

Box 4. Prospects for the Mining Sector
The mining sector (including petroleum) dominates Papua New Guinea’s economy. Recent positive
developments regarding projects already underway, partly related to current strong world prices,
suggest a brighter outlook than previously expected. In addition, new mining exploration applications
rose sharply in 2004-05 in response to higher world commodity prices and tax incentives introduced in
2003.
Queensland-Highlands Gas Project: The project calls for the construction of a 2,655 km gas pipeline
from the Highlands to northern Australia. After being stalled for many years owing to the failure to
secure sufficient customer sales contracts, a critical mass of preliminary purchase agreements have now
been signed. The front-end engineering and design phase is nearing completion and financing is being
arranged. Initial gas deliveries are targeted for 2009, if all goes to schedule, and the revenue accruing to
the government is expected to offset declining oil sector proceeds.
Oil (25 percent exports): Oil production declined in recent years, and current reserves are expected to
be exhausted by 2012. However, the largest producer, InterOil, has announced new bids for oil and gas
exploration.
Gold and silver (30 percent exports): Although gold output is in decline, prospects have recently been
brightened with the start of two new gold mines in 2005 and the key Hidden Valley and other smaller
projects beginning production by 2008.
Copper (17 percent exports), nickel and other minerals: Annual production of the declining Ok Tedi
copper mine now is expected to be higher and last longer than previously envisaged. The prospective
Ramu nickel/cobalt deposit could also contribute to higher mineral output in the longer run.

The medium-term outlook and success in improving development indicators is
subject to significant downside risks. These largely relate to continued uncertainties
regarding the nickel and gas projects, to commodity price volatility, and to prospects for the
continuation of current macroeconomic and structural policies. The delay or suspension of
the large mineral projects would sharply curtail the outlook for the fiscal position and the
external sector. Also, a reduction by 5 percent in the prices of Papua New Guinea’s main
commodity exports would reduce government revenue by about 0.3 percent of GDP each

- 14 -

year. Other potential downside risks include weak execution of the reform agenda,
particularly ahead of the 2007 elections. The downside risks support a continuation of the
authorities’ conservative approach to fiscal policy. If more favorable conditions were to
materialize instead, an acceleration of spending toward priority areas would be possible,
provided implementation capacity is not over taxed.
14.
The staff’s analysis of debt sustainability underscores the need to continue
prudent macroeconomic policies and reforms (Annex VI). The updated debt sustainability
analysis using the low-income country framework suggests that the public sector debt
outlook is particularly vulnerable to changes in real GDP growth. A return to the low levels
of real GDP growth experienced in the recent past would increase projected debt-to-GDP
ratios by 4 percentage points of GDP in 2010. The authorities acknowledged these risks, and
noted that their debt strategy, which monitors the Fund’s debt sustainability indicators, is
designed to reduce these vulnerabilities.
B. Maintaining Macroeconomic and Financial Stability
Fiscal policy: continuing fiscal prudence and accelerating fiscal reform
15.
The government’s medium-term fiscal strategy (MTFS) aims at keeping the
central government’s budget close to balance and progressively reducing public debt
relative to GDP. Within this framework, the government’s 2006 budget targets an overall
deficit of 0.6 percent of GDP. The mission supported the government’s fiscal objectives, and
views them as achievable and appropriate as they would imply a gradual reduction in the
nonmineral overall and primary balances and in the debt-to-GDP ratio between 2006 and
2010. However, the mission noted that risks to the medium-term strategy may derive from
commodity price and mineral revenue volatility, pressure for slower reform and unprioritized
spending ahead of the 2007 parliamentary elections, and financing participation in the
Queensland-Highlands gas pipeline project. To ensure that the consolidation to date is
safeguarded and medium-term sustainable fiscal balance is achieved, the mission encouraged
an acceleration and intensification of the public sector reform outlined in the MTDS (Boxes 2
and 3).
16.
The government introduced a tax policy package with the 2006 budget aimed at
encouraging investment and complemented by improvements in revenue collection. The
negative revenue impact of the tax package is estimated at about 0.5 percent of GDP in 2006,
25
mainly resulting from a progressive

reduction in personal income tax rates and
20
an increase in the exemption threshold (text

table). At the same time, initiatives to
improve tax collection include upgrading

audit capacity to assist in arrears recovery,

particularly from large taxpayers. The
mission viewed the tax package as a step

but recommended that the revenue loss

- 15 -

from the tax package and previously scheduled tax cuts (including under the ongoing tariff
reform) be offset by additional revenue-enhancing measures to guarantee the integrity of the
non-mineral tax base and support the MTDS. In particular, the mission pointed to PFTAC
technical assistance recommendations that could achieve this objective, such as through the
creation of a large taxpayer unit and the introduction of a presumptive tax regime for small
businesses. The authorities agreed with the need to safeguard the non-mineral revenue base
through improved tax administration and were receptive to the PFTAC proposals, although
they raised concerns that limited capacity could stymie effective implementation of reforms.
They also pointed to the possibility of raising goods and service tax (GST) rates if needed in
the future.

1/ Permanent measures introduced in the 2006 budget.

17.
In line with the MTDS, the authorities view expenditure re-orientation toward
development areas as a first priority. The mission welcomed the shift in 2006 budget
expenditure toward infrastructure, the increase in education and health spending, as well as
the improvements in the integrated payroll system that will continue to help control salary
expenditure. However, overall progress has been slow on expenditure reprioritization. While
large cuts were made in payrolls in nonpriority areas in 2004 and 2005, these were offset by
hiring in priority areas (including teachers and health workers). As a result, overall public
employment has remained broadly unchanged and the wage bill will remain large. Against
this background, the mission argued in favor of more front-loaded retrenchment instead of
the current gradual employment reduction plan, and accelerated time-bound execution of the
forthcoming recommendations from the “right-sizing” initiative’s to streamline the
government’s structure and refocus it on core business. The authorities recognized that little
progress had been made to date in reducing the wage bill, although it had been contained as a
share of total expenditure and no new wage increase was budgeted for 2006, and that

- 16 -

redoubled efforts were needed. These were expected to follow from the “right-sizing”
recommendations, including plans for retrenchment in nonpriority areas.
18.
The authorities have made progress in improving expenditure management and
plan to further strengthen budget preparation and financial and reporting systems
under their Public Expenditure Review and Rationalization (PERR) program. The
current monthly cash budget system and the introduction of financial controllers have helped
to keep spending within ceilings and limit the accumulation of new domestic arrears,
although unauthorized expenditure reallocations across spending items continue to occur.
The government has also made progress on trust accounts, including reducing the number by
half since 2004, and tagging another 350 for closure.2 To capitalize on recent progress, the
mission suggested introducing a time-bound plan to close the remaining trust accounts not
subject to standard financial management controls. In addition, as statutory authorities do not
follow basic accountability procedures, the mission suggested that their budget operations
should be subject to standard expenditure reporting obligations.
19.
The mission noted that should mineral revenue remain strong, maintaining the
2006 budget deficit target would imply an increase in expenditure and a deterioration
in the non-mineral balance. The mission advocated using any savings in 2006 to finance
some increase in priority infrastructure or social spending, as long as the capacity to
implement the spending effectively is not overtaxed. The bulk of any additional revenue
should be used to reduce government debt, which would provide a continuing flow of
resources in the form of lower interest payments and a hedge against the risks discussed
above. Over the longer term, as budget dependence on mineral revenue could increase as the
large gas and mineral projects underway come on line, the government should strengthen the
current fiscal framework to address the impact of mineral revenue volatility on expenditure
policy.
20.
The government has developed new guidelines for debt management that aim to
reduce costs and risks. The strategy is based on limiting acquisition of new debt to either
domestic or concessional sources and lengthening the maturity. The mission cautioned on
lengthening the maturity of government debt at high cost at a time when domestic interest
rates were coming down. It noted in particular that the recent oversubscriptions of longerterm maturity (and more costly) Inscribed Stocks auctions had resulted in yields well below
coupon rates. The authorities viewed these developments as reflecting the limited options for
longer-term investment in a liquid market. Nonetheless, they indicated that they planned to
proceed cautiously in order to avoid an inordinate rise in interest costs. The mission also
emphasized the importance of avoiding the contracting of new external debt on commercial
terms, and expressed concern about possible growing implicit contingent liabilities given
state-owned enterprises’ borrowing plans.

Trust accounts are used to hold third party funds (e.g., donor counterpart funds or court orders). Use
of the funds does not require treasury authorization and they do not need to be cleared at year end.

- 17 -

21.
The government is attentive to the need to strengthen financing and monitoring
of sub-national governments’ activities. Sub-national governments manage resources
amounting to about 20–25 percent of central government’s total expenditures, but are not
subject to basic control and reporting standards, while service delivery in rural areas remains
poor. The authorities acknowledged these concerns and noted their intention to proceed
quickly to clarify the legal framework underlying sub-national governments’ activities and
responsibilities, reform financing arrangements and the system of grants, and enforce a
reporting system for sub-national governments spending and debt. In addition, the district
service improvement program places local governments under the direct monitoring of the
central government treasury by creating small treasury offices in each district. The mission
welcomed these plans, and in particular noted the need to subject the district support grants,
which are outside budget oversight, to standard public expenditure controls and scrutiny
pending eventual elimination.
22.
The mission cautioned regarding the prospective contracting of additional debt
to finance equity investment in the new gas pipeline. Although the details of the
transaction have not been finalized, early indications are that the government would finance a
share of the pipeline during 2006–07. The authorities viewed the gas pipeline project as
essential to the economy’s future and saw their participation as necessary for its finalization.
However, they acknowledged the risks associated with an equity investment, and intended to
minimize any increase in debt.
Monetary policy and exchange rate policy: anchoring low inflation and maintaining
competitiveness
23.
The central bank reaffirmed its commitment to the objective of maintaining low
inflation. The authorities and the mission agreed that if fiscal policy remains prudent and the
current cautious monetary policy stance continues, inflation should remain subdued over the
medium term. However, as the combination of high excess reserves and low interest rates
have begun to revive credit growth, the mission cautioned the authorities about further
easing. Notwithstanding the apparent absence of inflationary pressure, the authorities
recognized that the current high liquidity held risks and noted that additional measures were
under consideration to supplement open market operations if needed, including levying
mineral taxes in kina. The authorities also plan to develop a secondary market for
government securities to assist in effective monetary policy implementation.
24.
The authorities and the mission agreed that the current floating exchange rate
arrangement remains appropriate, as it has helped to promote adjustments to economic
shocks and allowed the authorities to pursue an independent monetary policy. In the last
two years, the appreciation of the kina against the U.S. dollar helped bring down inflation
and ease the external debt service burden, without an apparent loss in competitiveness. The
authorities reaffirmed their commitment to the floating exchange rate and indicated that their
policy remained to intervene only to smooth volatility in the market.

- 18 -

25.
The authorities relaxed foreign exchange controls on a range of capital
transactions in June 2005. They noted that an initial assessment indicated that the impact on
the foreign exchange market had been minimal, notwithstanding negative interest rate
differentials with foreign partners. The authorities indicated that additional actions to
eliminate foreign exchange restrictions were under consideration.
26.
The central bank has made good progress in developing its monetary policy
framework over the past year. To bring a more medium-term focus to monetary policy, the
forecasting horizon was extended to three years with the assistance of an MFD expert. The
mission welcomed plans to further develop the central bank’s inflation forecasting capacity
and understanding of the monetary transmission mechanism, along with better coordination
with the Treasury on liquidity and debt management policies. Communication with the
public through the semi-annual Monetary Policy Statement has improved, helping to promote
confidence in the central bank and its policy regime, in addition to increasing public
accountability. The mission also drew attention to the need to implement the
recommendations of the recent STA mission on monetary statistics, in particular to address
weaknesses in the accounts of the central government at the central bank.
Private sector development through institution and capacity building: structural reforms
needed to reduce vulnerabilities and foster economic growth
27.
As noted in the MTDS, removing longstanding impediments to private
investment are essential to achieving higher growth and more rapid job creation. The
mission welcomed steps taken recently to improve the environment for private activity,
including the relaxation of restrictions on visa and work permits, greater resources for road
maintenance, reduction of the tax burden, and an improved dialogue with the business
community. Accelerated implementation of the MTDS is needed to address remaining
structural shortcomings hampering the private sector. These include further improving
telecommunication and transportation infrastructure (particularly in rural areas),
strengthening law and order, improving governance, addressing land tenure issues, reviving
an efficient “one–stop shop” for investment, strengthening contract enforcement through
judicial and legal training, and increasing transparency in public procurement. These steps
would also help to diversify the export base, reduce dependence on the mineral sector and
vulnerability to world commodity market developments, and promote job creation, which in
turn would help in improving the law and order climate.
28.
A strengthening of the regulatory framework for the central bank, banks, and
superannuation funds has improved financial sector soundness. Although a full set of
indicators is not available, available data show nonperforming loans continue to be low and
capital adequacy ratios remain above the minimum requirement. Steps are now needed to
complete reforms, including the implementation of the recommendations of Fund technical
assistance on financial sector supervision. Both the mission and the authorities agreed that
the rise in lending to the private sector in 2005 was a welcome sign that the financial sector
was providing support for growth. At the same time, the authorities promised to remain
vigilant to possible emerging risks, particularly regarding sector concentration of bank credit.

- 19 -

The authorities also indicated their intention to promptly implement the recently passed
AML/CFT legislation and create a Financial Intelligence Unit.

29.
The government acted to rehabilitate the Rural Development Bank (RDB) after
its declared insolvency in July 2004. The deterioration of the RDB's financial position in
recent years had reflected poor loan management due to weak governance. The financial
recovery plan for this bank: (a) replaced the previous board of directors and managing
director, (b) temporarily stopped lending activity, (c) recapitalized the bank through a
0.3 percent of GDP injection, (d) cut staff by one third with assistance of a 5 million kina
retrenchment grant, and (e) brought in experienced commercial lending officers to manage
the bank’s portfolio. The mission urged the passage of new legislation, scheduled for
submission to Parliament in early 2006, which would establish new corporate rules to ensure
the RDB operates on commercial grounds and limits political interference.
30.
The government reported that the larger public enterprises’ financial positions
have improved under outside management, but they indicated that additional measures
are needed to improve long-term prospects and the efficiency of these enterprises.
Among such measures were the introduction of a competition and regulatory framework for
each sector where public enterprises had a dominant or monopoly position. Also, prompt
publication of financial statements for these enterprises would enhance transparency and
governance. The mission noted that the establishment of a competition and regulatory
framework would also provide a foundation for reviving the privatization program. It also
welcomed the pass-through of increases in world oil prices to domestic petroleum product
prices and the increases in the tariff structure for utilities, and stressed the need to keep prices
in line with world prices or the costs of production. The authorities also observed that
Telikom’s monopoly status would be reviewed in 2007 when its current contract expired.
They indicated that privatization for some public enterprises in the future might be
considered.
31.
The mission encouraged the maintenance of the current open trade regime in
Papua New Guinea, which is among the least restrictive in the region. The elimination of
the copra marketing board, which helped stimulate copra exports in 2005, was also noted. A
seven-year tariff reform launched in 1999 is expected to be completed in early 2006. The

- 20 -

tariff structure will be compressed to four rates (zero, 30, 40, and 55 percent), resulting in a
reduction in the average nominal import tariff. Papua New Guinea does not face major
difficulties in accessing foreign markets.
32.
The mission urged rapid action on the authorities’ plans under MTDS to
improve governance through increased transparency and accountability. Governance
remains an important issue to be addressed, as acknowledged by the authorities. The mission
urged strengthening the transparency of fiscal operations by reinforcing the Office of the
Auditor General through additional resources and better compliance from government
entities to allow publication of the final audited accounts of the central and provincial
governments within one year as provided for under the law. The authorities agreed that
further strengthening of the auditing function required increased attention.
33.
Data provision for surveillance purposes has improved and is generally
adequate. Nevertheless, shortcomings in the quality, coverage, consistency, and timeliness
of national accounts, balance of payments, and fiscal data still affect the monitoring of
macroeconomic developments. Further strengthening of the statistical framework is needed
including through rehabilitation of the National Statistics Office. The authorities agreed with
this assessment and sought technical assistance from the Fund in improving the data base.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
34.
Since 2003, impressive progress has been made in reversing the difficult
macroeconomic conditions present earlier this decade. Macroeconomic stability has been
restored as the authorities adhered to disciplined fiscal and monetary policies against the
background of improved commodity prices. The key challenge ahead is to sustain recent
gains and move the economy to a higher growth path to reduce poverty. Implementation of
the Medium-Term Development Strategy (MTDS), which the staff supports, will help meet
this challenge. Achieving the medium-term fiscal objective of maintaining budget balance
and supporting higher growth will require structural fiscal reform. Monetary policy, at the
same time, should continue to focus on maintaining relatively low and stable inflation. In
addition, further structural reform is needed to remove longstanding impediments to private
investment and economic growth. The current favorable domestic and external economic
environment provides a window of opportunity for moving forward on MTDS reforms.
35.
The re-orientation of government expenditure toward needed infrastructure
and social spending under the MTDS is welcomed. The government is encouraged to
follow through with plans to reduce public employment, particularly in non-core areas, and
reduce the wage bill which continues to crowd out needed development expenditure.
Accordingly, a more front-loaded retrenchment in government employment should be
considered. The staff supports rapid implementation of the right-sizing initiative
recommendations to streamline the government and refocus it on core activities.
36.
The 2006 tax policy package improves incentives for private activity, and can be
financed easily in an environment of mineral revenue windfalls. The authorities are

- 21 -

cautioned about using such windfalls to finance permanent changes in the tax system,
however. To support the Medium-Term Fiscal Strategy over the long term, the non-mineral
revenue base should be strengthened through implementation of measures to improve tax
administration, including the establishment of a large taxpayer unit.
37.
Should mineral revenue remain high and surpluses emerge over the medium
term, the government is urged to continue the practices followed in the recent past. Any
windfall savings should be used to finance priority infrastructure or social spending, as long
as it can be spent effectively, and to repay government debt. Conversely, should the risks to
the medium-term outlook materialize, the authorities would need to consider steps to
safeguard the MTFS.
38.
Progress in expenditure and debt management has been made, but challenges
remain to improve spending controls. The monthly cash budget system and the
introduction of financial controllers were particularly welcomed. The staff encourages the
authorities to extend standard financial management control to remaining trust accounts, to
statutory authorities budgets, and to sub-national government operations including district
support grants. The authorities are cautioned about the need to monitor growing contingent
liabilities related to state-owned enterprises’ borrowing plans.
39.
The central bank’s continuing focus on maintaining low inflation is welcome.
Although inflationary pressure remains at bay, high liquidity in the banking system and low
interest rates are encouraging rapid credit growth. The authorities are cautioned against
further policy easing and encouraged in their efforts to strengthen and develop tools for
effective monetary policy implementation. The current floating exchange rate arrangement
has helped to promote adjustments to economic shocks and permits the authorities to pursue
an independent monetary policy.
40.
Progress has been made in strengthening the financial sector. Steps have been
taken to rehabilitate the Rural Development Bank, but the authorities will need to do more,
including establishing a legal framework to ensure the bank operates on commercial terms
and is free from political interference to avoid a return to past difficulties.
41.
Higher growth, employment creation, and poverty reduction over the longer
term will depend on stronger private sector activity. The accelerated implementation of
the remainder of the MTDS is needed to address structural impediments hampering the
private sector. Greater competition in the public enterprise sector, including through opening
the sector to competition and reviving the privatization program is needed. Governance
remains weak, and rapid implementation is needed of plans to increase transparency and
accountability, including through greater support of the Office of the Auditor General to
allow timely publication of government accounts.
42.
Data provision for surveillance purposes is generally adequate, but further
strengthening is needed to address continued weaknesses. The authorities are urged to
move rapidly to correct shortcomings in the quality, coverage, consistency, and timeliness of

- 22 -

national accounts, balance of payments, and fiscal data that continue to affect the monitoring
of macroeconomic developments.
43.
The staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation be held on the
standard 12-month cycle.

Sources: Data provided by the Papua New Guinea authorities; and Fund staff estimates.
1/ In 2006, expenditures are above budget ceilings as they include projected saving from interest payments.
2/ In 2005, the authorities treat savings for a future acquisition of an equity participations in the PNG gas project as an expenditure. Under IMF's GFS standards, these
are treated as savings below the line. These savings are then used in 2006 and the transaction is registered below the line under nonbanks domestic financing. A memo
item shows IMF staff projections according to the authorities' treatment.

Safeguards Assessments:

Under the Fund's safeguards assessment policy, the Bank of Papua New Guinea (BPNG)
was subject to a transitional assessment based on its SBA with the Fund, which was
approved in March 2000 and expired in September 2001. The transitional assessment was
completed on May 4, 2001, and it identified certain weaknesses and made appropriate
recommendations, as reported in the 2002 Article IV staff report. BPNG will be subject

VIII. Exchange Rate Arrangement:
The exchange rate of the kina is determined freely in the interbank market in which
authorized banks participate, although the central bank may intervene with spot purchases
or sales of foreign exchange.

ANNEX II

PAPUA NEW GUINEA: RELATIONS WITH
1
THE PACIFIC FINANCIAL TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CENTRE
Assistance to Papua New Guinea (PNG) in recent years has been limited due to the presence of
extensive assistance under the Australian Enhanced Cooperation Plan (ECP). In all, there have
been 13 missions since 2000. PNG has sent 38 officials to the Center’s regional seminars,
workshops and training courses in this period.
Public Financial Management
PFTAC assisted in the preparation of a ROSC, which was published in October 2000, and
participated in a FAD technical assistance mission (December 2000) on the reconciliation of
fiscal and monetary reports on government activity.
Tax Administration and Policy
The Internal Revenue Commission is receiving extensive assistance under the ECP program.
PFTAC’s taxation expert visited PNG in August 2004 to examine and make recommendations
for reform of its organizational structure, operations and procedures and measures to strengthen
the revenue collection capabilities and improve voluntary compliance, including through the
establishment of a Large Taxpayers Unit. A follow up mission in April 2005 indicated that the
authorities continue to study the reforms recommended but have no present plans to implement
them.
Financial Sector Regulation and Supervision
There is no current PFTAC involvement in this area but the advisor visited BPNG in September
2004 and July 2005 to identify areas where technical assistance could be provided. In October
2005, the BPNG hosted the annual meeting of the Association of Financial Supervisors of Pacific
Countries. PFTAC is the secretariat.
Economic and Financial Statistics
In 2000, PFTAC conducted a review of statistical operations, with a follow-up mission in
February 2001. A peripatetic adviser assisted the central bank on the balance of payments in May
2003. PNG is a member of the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) project organized
under PFTAC, but has yet to submit metadata; further TA in this area will be subject to
improvement with GDDS metadata.

The Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre (PFTAC) in Suva, Fiji is a regional technical
assistance institution operated by the IMF with financial support of the Asian Development Bank,
Australia, Japan and New Zealand. The Center’s aim is to build skills and institutional capacity for
effective economic and financial management that can be sustained at the national level. Member
countries are: Cook Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Niue,
Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tokelau, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu.

ANNEX III

PAPUA NEW GUINEA: RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
For questions relating to this annex, contact Mahesh Sharma at the (phone 202-458-7339) at
the World Bank
To date, the World Bank has provided 35 IBRD loans and 13 IDA credits to PNG, amounting
to US$786.6 million and US$114.9 million in commitments, respectively. There are four
active loans, totaling US$82 million in commitments: Gas Development TA (US$7 million),
Mining TA (US$10 million), Gazelle Restoration Project (US$25 million) and the Road
Maintenance and Rehabilitation Project (US$40 million). In addition, the Bank is
implementing a Global Environment Facility-supported Teachers’ Solar Lighting Project
(US$0.992 million).
In June 2003, the World Bank suspended disbursements on the Forestry and Conservation
Project (FCP) due to a number of areas of noncompliance with the loan agreement, with
respect to which the Government had been unable to make adequate progress in the
preceding months. In June 2005 the World Bank cancelled the loan. However, work is
continuing on priority analytical/advisory services, in the fields of public expenditure
management, health and education service delivery, and HIV/AIDS strategy.
Given the uncertain operating environment, the World Bank has prepared an Interim Strategy
Note (ISN) in line with guidelines for assistance to Low-Income Countries Under Stress.
Prepared in lieu of a Country Assistance Strategy, this will guide the Bank’s involvement in
PNG over the next 18 months and enable the Bank to evaluate its comparative advantage in the
country. The objectives of are to: (a) promote development dialogue and stem the decline in
social indicators; and (b) build the foundations for improved governance and sustained recovery.
The scale and scope of assistance is likely to be modest, with an emphasis on analytical work,
policy advice, capacity-building, and communications/outreach. The paper was presented to the
Bank’s Board of April 12, 2005.
Preparation of Smallholder Agriculture Development Project that had been put on hold due to the
suspension of FCP has been restarted and work on Community Driven Development stocktaking
is also ongoing. The Bank has also launched a Youth Competition Program (Development
Marketplace) which has attracted a large number of partners. Furthermore, the Bank is involved
in a number of community outreach programs supported by its Global Development Learning
Network.
IFC, through its Pacific Enterprise Development Facility (PEDF), has in the past secured
financing for 22 individual enterprises. In more recent times PEDF has initiated a program of
technical assistance to support the development of small and medium enterprises in selected
sectors. Through its Capacity Building Fund, IFC has contributed US$100,000 towards the cost
of an improved credit appraisal system at Bank South Pacific which has significantly increased
the availability and reduced the cost of finance in rural PNG.
Subject to the approval of the Government of PNG, in 2006 IFC expects to establish a
permanent presence in-country. Through this office, PEDF will undertake a significantly

- 38 -

enhanced program targeting SMEs in the agribusiness, tourism, and oil, gas and mining
sectors. This program will work to improve access to finance, supply chains, product
development and marketing, and the linking of large and smaller enterprises.
On the investment side, IFC has committed US$14.5 million in three projects, including a
US$3.0 million investment in the Kula Fund, which made four investments totaling US$4.9
million since its establishment in 1997. In FY05, IFC committed US$1.2 million in equity plus
a US$2 million line of credit for PNG Microfinance Limited and is in the process of organizing
a US$2.2 million capacity building technical assistance program. In addition, IFC is reviewing
potential investments in the gas sector. IFC and the Foreign Investment Advisory Service
support activities aimed at generating sustainable employment opportunities by improving the
environment for domestic and foreign investment.
The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) has facilitated a total of US$892
million in foreign direct investment in Papua New Guinea. MIGA currently has one
guarantee in the mining sector worth U$51 million in gross exposure.

ANNEX IV

PAPUA NEW GUINEA: RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK1
Through mid-December 2005, the Asian Development Bank (AsDB) had approved 57 loans totaling
$874 million for 46 projects. Of this total, 24 loans ($463 million) had been extended from ordinary
capital resources and 33 loans ($412 million) from special funds resources. In addition, $46 million
had been provided for 126 technical assistance projects. There are currently 9 active loan-financed
projects, and one which is being closed.
With the overarching objective of alleviating poverty, the AsDB strategy for Papua New Guinea
focuses on strengthening governance, supporting private sector development, and improving social
conditions. As weak public sector management and ineffective public services continue to be the
main development problems, the short-term priorities are: consolidation (focusing on relationships
with the Government and donors), policy dialogue in key sectors, administration and implementation
of existing projects, and very selective identification of operations to deliver clear results. Based on
lessons learned, e.g., in supporting private sector development, AsDB will explore alternative
channels for the delivery of assistance to achieve development objectives. AsDB will continue to
strengthen public sector management, particularly in the areas of fiscal and financial management and
public service reform. For private sector development, AsDB has been helping to improve sector
policy and institutional frameworks (agriculture), enhance factor productivity (skills development and
microfinance services), and improve market access by selected transport infrastructure investments,
especially in rural areas. AsDB will expand its support to private sector development by helping to
bring about fundamental change where the public goods that provide the foundation for private sector
activity are weak or non-existent, and by helping increase the role of the private sector. In the social
sectors, AsDB will continue to assist in policy development (health) and to support infrastructure
investments (water and sanitation), and service delivery. AsDB will expand its efforts to help address
the growing HIV/AIDS pandemic.
The latest loan was approved on March 25, 2004 for $19 million for community water transport. No
lending is envisaged in 2005. In 2006, a grant of $15 million from special funds resources (the first
such grant for Papua New Guinea) is envisaged for HIV/AIDS. For 2006, tentative plans call for two
road transport projects, financed with three loans: (i) a $20 million supplementary loan from ordinary
capital resources for the Highlands Region road maintenance and upgrading project and
(ii) rehabilitation of the Highlands Highway (financed with $18 million from special funds resources
and $22 million from ordinary capital resources) - work on the Highlands Highway project may well
be deferred to 2007. Also in 2006, a $13 million loan from special fund resources is possible for
health sector development. Possible AsDB financing for the proposed gas pipeline to Australia may
be finalized during 2006. The current program envisages annual grant-financed technical assistance
totaling about $2 million, not including special grants from special fund resources.

ANNEX V

PAPUA NEW GUINEA: STATISTICAL ISSUES
Data provision for surveillance purposes is generally adequate. However, inadequate
coverage, and timeliness of statistical releases continue to hinder the conduct of
macroeconomic policy. The National Statistical Office (NSO) is underfunded and lacks
sufficient staff with computer training. It faces difficulties obtaining and collating data from
businesses and other government departments, although it does have the relevant legal
power. As a result, the only economic release produced on a somewhat timely basis is the
Consumer Price Index. The Bank of Papua New Guinea (BPNG) and the Department of
Treasury produce the most current data. The NSO, with assistance from AusAID, completed
collections for the 2000 Population Census and released preliminary results in July 2001.
Using some of the expertise and equipment it acquired for this census, the NSO intended to
conduct a Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) in 2002, but work on the
survey was postponed due to funding constraints. Papua New Guinea participates in the
Pacific Regional General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) Project and was represented at
the GDDS workshop held in Suva in November 2002. A GDDS coordinator has been
nominated and metadata is being developed prior to formal participation in the GDDS.
Monetary data are not available on a regular basis and reporting to the Fund’s
Statistics Department (STA) needs to be improved. A monetary and financial statistics
mission that visited the country during April 2005 (i) reviewed the Bank of Papua New
Guinea’s (BPNG) collection, compilation, and dissemination procedures; (ii) introduced the
standard form for reporting central bank data and designed the central bank survey; and
(iii) initiated the development of an integrated monetary database from which alternative
presentations of monetary statistics can be derived for use by the BPNG, APD, and STA. The
mission made recommendations for improving compilation and reporting. Most of the
recommendations aim at fully aligning the sectorization of the domestic economy,
classification of financial instruments, valuation procedures, and institutional coverage of the
depository corporations with the MFSM.
In mid-2000, the NSO released a set of national accounts estimates: National Income,
Expenditure and Product, 1993–98. These estimates were compiled using the 1968 System
of National Accounts. However, the NSO has been working to implement the 1993 System
National Accounts. In March 2004, the NSO released a preliminary set of national income,
expenditure, and production accounts estimates for 1994–2002, rebased to 1998 prices. As
these figures are still subject to revisions, they have not been used to update staff’s estimates.
A Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre (PFTAC) mission in February 2001
identified several sources that could be used to generate measures of business activity:
•

Corporate income tax data from the Internal Revenue Commission (IRC), corporate
profits, revenues, and other financial data for some 4,000 companies.

•

Value-added tax data from the IRC: sales and input data for a broad range of businesses.

- 41 -

•

Membership data from the superannuation funds: employment numbers for both the
private and public sectors.

The government needs to ensure that the NSO is granted access to these data and that
additional resources are provided to compile these series on a timely basis.
The only price index currently compiled is a quarterly CPI. Its main deficiencies include
outdated weights that are based on consumption studies conducted in the mid-1970s and
weaknesses in data collection practices. The NSO intends to use the results of the planned
HIES to rebase the CPI; however, this has been delayed. Moreover, there is a need for
technical assistance to computerize the collation and production of the index.
Annual government finance statistics (GFS) reported to STA suffer from insufficient
coverage and timeliness. While central government tax revenue statistics are generally
accurate and timely, nontax revenue and public expenditure data are deficient. In particular,
development budget expenditures and the utilization of grants and project loans are recorded
with long lags, and few records on the use of accrual trust accounts are available. While
interest payment records are accurate, there are timing issues regarding the recording of
interest on discount securities. No data are available for deferred pension liabilities to civil
servants, provincial and local government budgets, off-budget outlays and corresponding
liabilities, or transfers between the government and public enterprises. These weaknesses
contribute to discrepancies in domestic financing between estimates from monetary and debt
data and those derived from fiscal records. The latest data reported and published in the GFS
Yearbook and IFS are for 1999-2002 and cover only budgetary central government.
Quarterly data on the balance of payments are reported to the Fund for publication
with a substantial lag; no data have been reported since mid 2002. These data are based
on the exchange record system, which is not tightly monitored despite BPNG reporting
requirements. The financial accounts data are of poor quality because of major deficiencies in
data collection, especially in the areas of private external debt. In many cases, donors and
lenders disburse funds directly to contractors for the purchase of goods and services,
effectively bypassing the exchange record system. Therefore, a substantial proportion of
current account and capital flows are not recorded. As a first step, efforts are underway to
improve the coverage of the merchandise trade statistics by moving to customs-based data.
The ASYCUDA customs system currently used by the IRC electronically records about
80 percent of trade transactions, but as yet neither BPNG nor the NSO has the resources to
access this database the NSO have the resources to access this database.

ANNEX VI

PAPUA NEW GUINEA: PUBLIC AND EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
This annex summarizes the debt sustainability analysis (DSA) for Papua New Guinea using
the new framework for low-income countries.1 The baseline macroeconomic scenario
underlying this DSA is the medium-term outlook discussed in the staff report, including the
sustained implementation of the ongoing medium-term fiscal strategy. This annex also
assesses the impact of various exogenous shocks on the sustainability of public sector debt
and external debt under the baseline scenario.
A. Main Assumptions
•

Real GDP growth is anticipated to rise gradually from about 3 percent in 2005 to about
4.5 percent by 2010, as agricultural productivity improves, the gas pipeline project and
the Ramu nickel mine come on line toward the end of the decade, and structural reform
is implemented.

•

Monetary policy remains geared toward achieving the objective of keeping inflation at
subdued levels and maintaining a sound external position.

•

Near balance of the fiscal accounts are expected from 2007 forward, along with gradual
improvements in the nonmineral overall and primary balances between 2006 and 2010.

•

Papua New Guinea would have access to external concessional finance.

•

Prices of key commodities are in line with WEO projections.

•

Structural reforms, including those under the Medium-term Development Strategy,
would continue to gradually improve governance, law and order, transportation
infrastructure, and public sector enterprises’ finances. Overall, the investment climate
would continue to slowly be enhanced.
B. Total Public Sector Debt Sustainability

The public sector debt ratio has steadily declined from 76 percent of GDP at end-2002
to an estimated 49 percent of GDP at end-2005. The improvement reflects the
government’s prudent fiscal policy, favorable mineral sector developments, the appreciation
of the kina, declining interest rates, and a sustained economic recovery since the current
government took office in mid-2002. Multilateral debt accounts for about 58 percent of total
external public debt.
1

See Operational Framework for Debt Sustainability Assessments in Low-Income Countries—
Further Considerations (SM/05/109).

- 44 -

Under the baseline projected scenario, the public sector debt ratio is expected to decline
gradually to about 43 percent of GDP by end-2010 and 17 percent by 2025 (Annex VI,
Table 1). The reduction would result mainly from continued adherence to the medium-term
fiscal strategy and improved growth prospects in line with the assumptions above. The
downward debt dynamics are delayed by the assumption that the government borrows about
4 percent of GDP in 2007 to complete the financing of its equity participation in the
Highlands-Queensland gas pipeline.1 In addition, the debt stock from 2005 forward includes
contingent liabilities of the government for the first time (debt of statutory authorities). The
NPV of public debt would decline from 54 percent of GDP in 2005 to 42 percent of GDP in
2010 and 16 percent of GDP in 2025.The public sector debt service to revenue ratio would
remain broadly stable at about 15 percent during the medium term, and falling significantly
over the longer term. Public sector debt projections would be affected should contingent
liabilities arise in relation to government guarantees (e.g., on public enterprise investment
projects) or if the government chose a smaller or higher level of equity investment in the gas
pipeline project.
The overall results suggest that, under the IMF-WB DSA framework for LICs, Papua
New Guinea’s total public sector debt is at moderate-to-high risk of debt distress.2 The
main findings include: (i) only one indicator—NPV of debt to GDP ratio—is above its
threshold under the baseline scenario—and it declines under the threshold over the long term,
(ii) other indicators are well below their threshold over the entire projected period, and
(iii) only under one bound test for lower real GDP growth are these thresholds significantly
breached.
The standard sensitivity analysis shows that the path of the debt ratios are particularly
sensitive to changes in real GDP growth and the exchange rate (Annex VI, Table 2 and
Figure 1). To test the robustness of the baseline scenario, we subjected it to a number of
stress tests. Compared to 2005, a decline in real GDP growth to one standard deviation below
its historical average would raise the NPV of public debt to GDP ratio by about 16
percentage points of GDP in 2010. A one-time 30 percent real exchange rate depreciation in
2006 would raise the NPV of debt to GDP ratio by about 10 percentage points in 2010.

1

A decision has not yet been made on how this borrowing would be financed. As a working
assumption, the staff assumes one third would be financed through external concessional loans and
the remainder through external commercial borrowing.

2

Papua New Guinea is rated as a poor performer with regard to its policies and institutions under the
joint IMF-WB DSA framework for LICs. Thus, the thresholds applied to Papua New Guinea are:
(i) 100 percent for NPV of debt-to-exports, (ii) 30 percent for NPV of debt-to-GDP, and
(iii) 200 percent for NPV of debt-to-fiscal revenue; and for debt service: (i) 15 percent of exports and
(ii) 25 percent of revenues.

- 45 -

C. External Debt Sustainability
Papua New Guinea’s total external debt has also declined steadily in recent years, from
76 percent of GDP in 2002 to about 38 percent of debt in 2005 (Annex VI, Table 3).
External debt as a percent of exports has also declined from 19 percent in 2002 to 11 percent
in 2005.
External public debt dynamics are sustainable under the baseline scenario, as all three
debt indicators (the NPV of public external debt to GDP, the NPV of debt in percent of
exports, and the debt service to exports ratio) do not breach the key thresholds. The NPV of
public external debt rises in 2007 with the borrowing by about 4 percent of GDP to complete
the assumed financing of its equity participation in the Highlands-Queensland gas pipeline.
Thereafter it declines, reaching 23 percent of GDP in 2010 and 10 percent of GDP in 2025.
External debt sustainability is most vulnerable to shocks to real GDP growth rates and
lower export growth. Stress tests indicate the NPV of public external debt to GDP threshold
would initially rise significantly under a lower real GDP growth, lower export growth and
exchange rate depreciation shocks, before falling below the thresholds by the end of the
period. A decline in real GDP growth by one standard deviation below its historical average
would raise the NPV of external public debt from 2005 by 30 percentage points of GDP in
2007 with the impact declining gradually over the medium term to 43 percent of GDP by
2010 and 19 percent by 2025. A decline in export value growth by one standard deviation
below its historical average would raise the NPV of external debt-to-GDP ratio from 2005 by
35 percentage points to a high of 61 percent of GDP in 2007, before falling to 19 percent of
GDP by 2025 over the longer term. Nonetheless, Papua New Guinea’s external debt distress
risk is moderated by the fact it has an excellent external repayment record.3
D. Conclusions
With continued adherence to prudent macroeconomic and fiscal policies, Papua New
Guinea’s debt indicators are projected to improve over the medium-to-long term, but
slippage of these policies could have adverse consequences on public external debt
sustainability. Papua New Guinea’s recent progress in reducing the stock of public debt and
its capacity to repay future obligations suggest that the stock of debt and debt service as
presently projected appear manageable and sustainable. However, this assessment rests on
the need to avoid policy slippages and highlights the vulnerability of the debt dynamics to
potential shocks. To further help guard against these vulnerabilities, Papua New Guinea
needs to ensure that any external borrowing is obtained on concessional terms.

Papua New Guinea has never defaulted on external debt to its creditors.

Estimate Projections

Sources: Country authorities; and Fund staff estimates and projections.
1/ General government gross debt. The increase in debt in 2007 reflects the staff's understanding regarding current plans for financing a full equity acquisition in the gas pipeline project.
2/ Gross financing need is defined as the primary deficit plus debt service plus the stock of short-term debt at the end of the last period.
3/ Revenues including grants.
4/ Debt service is defined as the sum of interest and amortization of medium and long-term debt.
5/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.

Key macroeconomic and fiscal assumptions
Real GDP growth (in percent)
Average nominal interest rate on forex debt (in percent)
Average real interest rate on domestic currency debt (in percent)
Real exchange rate depreciation (in percent, + indicates depreciation)
Inflation rate (GDP deflator, in percent)
Growth of real primary spending (deflated by GDP deflator, in percent)
Grant element of new external borrowing (in percent)

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt. The increase in debt in 2007 reflects the staff's understanding regarding current plans for financing a full equity acquisition in the gas pipeline project.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that NPV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments devided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.

IMF Concludes 2005 Article IV Consultation with Papua New Guinea
On February 13, 2006, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Papua New Guinea.1
Background
From the mid-1990s until the early years of 2000, Papua New Guinea’s economic and social
performance had been poor. Real GDP was broadly unchanged since the early 1990s and per
capita income little higher than at the time of independence in 1975, as political instability and
a rapid succession of governments hampered the implementation of appropriate economic
policies. Private activity was stagnant, poverty increased and social indicators, already among
the worst for comparable countries, further deteriorated.
The current government, led by Prime Minister Sir Michael Somare, has made strides in
addressing the economic challenges that it inherited since taking office in 2002. It
progressively tightened fiscal policy, in tandem with supportive monetary policy, in a bid to
support growth while putting the economy on a more stable footing for the future. As a result,
and aided by improving global commodity price developments, the country’s economic position
has improved and macroeconomic stability has been restored. Real GDP growth turned

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of
the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to
the country's authorities. This PIN summarizes the views of the Executive Board as expressed
during the February 13, 2006 Executive Board discussion based on the staff report.

positive in 2003, after contracting in the previous three years, and inflation dropped sharply.
The government additionally set out a medium-term development strategy focusing on
economic reform needed to boost growth to a higher sustainable level.
The economy is now performing well as the recovery maintains its momentum, the external
position remains healthy, and inflation is low. Real GDP rose by about 3 percent in 2004, in
line with the previous year, and a similar rate of growth is expected for 2005. The mining and
agricultural sectors were the initial drivers behind the recovery, boosted by an upswing in
commodity prices and improved weather. Fiscal and monetary discipline, together with
exchange rate appreciation, led to a sharp reduction in average CPI inflation in 2004 to around
2 percent from 14.7 percent in the preceding year, and inflation is estimated to average
1 percent in 2005. The external accounts are expected to be in surplus in 2005, buoyed by
high commodity prices for minerals and oil, but also reflecting the start of oil refinery operations
and increased non-mineral export volume.
The government continued to consolidate the fiscal position in 2005, with the projected
outcome for the year stronger than budgeted. High mineral and non-mineral revenue (buoyed
by continued high commodity prices and stronger than expected growth), and lower than
expected expenditure (including on interest payments) generated net savings for the year of
about 5 percentage points of GDP. Under the authorities’ revised budget, about half the
savings was used to reduce the stock of domestic arrears and increase spending in priority
areas. Another 2.5 percent of GDP of savings were set aside for a future equity acquisition in
the Highlands-Queensland gas pipeline project and recorded as an expenditure. As a result,
the authorities estimated a budget deficit of 0.6 percent compared to the original budget
projection of a deficit of 0.9 percent of GDP. Adjusting for the funds set aside but not actually
spent in 2005 (although these funds will be spent in 2006), the staff estimates the budget
balance to be significantly stronger than official estimates. The improved fiscal outcome
resulted in a further reduction in total public sector debt, about half of which is external debt, to
49 percent of GDP in 2005 from 72 percent in 2002.
As monetary policy has been relaxed in line with the tightening of fiscal policy, credit to the
private sector revived while inflation remains low. In the absence of inflationary or exchange
rate pressure, the central bank progressively lowered the signaling Kina Facility Rate from a
16 percent peak in July 2003 to 6 percent in September 2005. Broad money is expected to rise
by over 13 percent in 2005, reflecting increased net foreign assets. In response to lower
interest rates, abundant liquidity and more stable economic and political conditions, private
sector credit picked up for the first time in four years, increasing by about 20 percent from a
low base.
Over the past two years, the kina has remained roughly unchanged on a real effective
exchange rate basis, while external reserves have increased. The kina appreciated against the
U.S. dollar by about 15 percent in nominal terms during this period, mainly reflecting strong
export receipts along with a gradual restoration of confidence in economic management.
Gross international reserves are expected to close 2005 at 5.5 months of non-mineral imports.

-3-

External competitiveness appears adequate, given increased non-mineral export volume and a
relatively stable share of total Papua New Guinea’s exports in total world exports.
The authorities have taken steps to improve public sector efficiency and the investment
environment, but overall progress in implementing structural reform has been slow. Positive
steps have been made through the adoption of stricter controls on recurrent public expenditure
and some reduction in the wage bill. However, advancement of the broader reform of the
public sector was slow, particularly in revenue administration and provincial government
operations. Movement on infrastructure investment and land reform also was limited and
privatization stalled. The financial system overall remains healthy. The financial condition of
the government-owned Rural Development Bank has improved somewhat, but it remains to be
seen whether sufficient measures are in place to avoid a return to past financial difficulties.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for the impressive progress made in reversing
the difficult macroeconomic conditions inherited earlier this decade. In 2005, real GDP growth
remained at 3 percent, inflation declined further from its already low level, the fiscal and
external positions strengthened, and public debt indicators declined.
Directors considered that the key challenge going forward will be to sustain recent gains while
moving the economy to a higher growth path to reduce poverty. Achievement of these
objectives will require the authorities to accelerate fiscal reform and to persevere with fiscal
prudence, a supportive monetary policy, and structural reform to encourage private
investment. Strengthening the non-mineral sector will be key to diversifying the export and
revenue base, and promoting private sector job opportunities. Directors welcomed the
commitment to these policies in the government’s Medium-Term Development Strategy
(MTDS), and called for their resolute implementation.
Directors commended the authorities for the strong fiscal outcome in 2005. They welcomed
the re-orientation of government expenditure toward needed infrastructure and social spending
and encouraged rapid follow through with plans to reduce the wage bill and streamline the
government. It was noted that, in implementing such streamlining, the authorities should be
mindful of safeguarding the overall quality of the public service as well as the efficient delivery
of services. Directors noted that the 2006 tax policy package improves incentives for private
sector activity, but cautioned that the non-mineral revenue base should be strengthened in
parallel through improved tax administration. In the event that mineral revenues remain high
and surpluses emerge over the medium term, Directors recommended the continued use of
such resources for priority infrastructure and social spending and to repay government debt.
The authorities will also need to be cognizant of the importance of containing any fiscal risks in
the run-up to the 2007 election.
Directors noted the progress in public expenditure control and debt management. They
encouraged further strengthening of budget management in line with the recommendations
from the Public Expenditure and Rationalization Review. Directors also highlighted the need to

-4-

strengthen the management and transparency of expenditures at the sub-national level. In
addition, they endorsed the authorities’ medium-term debt strategy, and underscored the
importance of continued close cooperation with donors. They urged the authorities to avoid
nonconcessional borrowing, including to finance the gas pipeline project.
Directors welcomed the central bank’s continuing focus on maintaining low inflation. They
welcomed the recent increase in private sector credit from a low base. However, in view of the
high liquidity in the economy and low interest rates, they supported the authorities’ intention to
monitor developments closely and tighten monetary policy as necessary. Directors also
encouraged the central bank’s ongoing efforts to strengthen monetary policy tools. They
viewed the current floating exchange rate arrangement as appropriate, given its role in helping
promote adjustments to economic shocks. Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to
intervene in the foreign exchange market only to smooth volatility.
On structural issues, Directors noted that higher growth, employment creation, and poverty
reduction over the longer term will depend on stronger private sector activity. Thus, an
accelerated and strengthened implementation of the MTDS is needed, including, in particular,
actions to increase competition in the public enterprise sector, improve law and order,
strengthen governance and increase transparency and accountability, upgrade infrastructure,
and simplify investment regulations. While observing that significant progress has been made
in strengthening the financial sector, Directors urged that necessary steps be taken to
consolidate the rehabilitation of the Rural Development Bank. Directors also recommended
that rapid action be taken to address continued weaknesses in data provision.

Statement by Richard Murray, Alternate Executive Director for Papua New Guinea
and Igimu Momo, Advisor to Executive Director
February 13, 2006
Our authorities thank management for their continued support of Papua New Guinea (PNG)
during 2005 and welcome the frank exchange of views between senior ministers and officials
with the mission team. The Treasurer and Minister for Finance has commented on the
balanced assessment in the Article IV report and the constructive nature of the Fund’s
engagement in PNG. We also thank staff for the selected issues paper that particularly points
to the drivers of productivity and growth, and their implications for the medium-term
outlook.
Improved economic performance in PNG has been further consolidated in 2005, with good
prospects for 2006. The recovery is against a backdrop of strong commodity prices that have
boosted the petroleum and minerals sectors. But the wider nature of the recovery
demonstrates the continuation of macroeconomic stability brought about through strong
economic policy leadership from the Somare Government since its election in 2002.
To ensure ongoing progress in implementing sustainable macroeconomic policies and
structural reforms, the Government has put in place two overarching frameworks for policy
formulation and implementation.
•

Medium Term Fiscal Strategy (MTFS) maps out an affordable and sustainable path
of public spending. It aims to reduce the budget deficit progressively to balance by
2008, and progressively reduce public debt to GDP.

•

Medium Term Development Strategy (MTDS) provides the overarching
development strategy and specifies the broad policy framework in which the
Government’s Agenda for Recovery and Growth will be implemented over the
medium-term. It identifies broad spending priorities to guide public expenditure
management and redirects spending to “priority areas”, including transport
infrastructure maintenance, law and justice, basic education, and preventative health,
including HIV/AIDS.

Fundamental to economic stability and improving conditions for a stable private investment
environment, has been political stability. As set out in the staff report, the Somare
Government is likely to be the first PNG government since independence in 1975 to
complete a full five-year term, with elections due in 2007. A range of measures, including
the introduction of the Political Parties and Integrity Act, has enhanced political stability.
Moreover, additional resources have been injected into the Electoral Commission in the 2006
Budget to ensure preparations for an orderly and well-managed political process in 2007,
including the implementation of the preferential voting system to further strengthen political
stability.

-2-

In assessing this latest Article IV consultation with PNG, Executive Directors will no doubt
reflect carefully on the ongoing Fund relationship with PNG. The PNG Government
deserves due recognition for the degree to which they have sought a seachange in policy
direction since 2002. But they also recognize that there is still much more to be done. As the
Treasurer and Minister for Finance set out in his 2006 Budget Speech to Parliament:
“We cannot be complacent. Despite the impressive recovery, our
economy is still fragile. If our reform efforts falter now we will give up
all of the hard-won gains that we have made.”
Of particular concern will be navigating macroeconomic policy, especially containing fiscal
risks, ahead of the 2007 election. Again, my authorities are well aware of the dangers, as
clearly acknowledged in the Budget Speech, particularly that if fiscal discipline under the
MTFS is not maintained, then the economy and living standards will be damaged.
Improving Economic Performance
Economic performance has continued to improve since 2002, with lower inflation and
interest rates, an improving investment trend, more employment, a stable exchange rate and a
stronger external position. GDP is expected to have grown by 3.0 percent in 2005, from 2.9
percent in 2004, while non-mining GDP is expected to have grown by 3.5 percent in 2005,
driven mainly by growth in the construction, agriculture, forestry and fisheries sectors.
Inflation has fallen from almost 20 percent in 2003 to 1.7 percent in 2005 (though through
the year inflation to December 2005 was somewhat higher). Interest rates have fallen
sharply, with market rates currently under 5 percent.
Latest available data indicates that international reserves increased to K2,396 million
(US$774 million) at the end of 2005, from K2,061 million (US$639 million) in 2004, and is
sufficient to cover 4.7 months of total imports and 9.0 months of non-mineral imports.
The balance of payments recorded a surplus of 2.9 percent of GDP in 2005, from a surplus of
2.4 percent of GDP in 2004.
Private sector employment increased by 2.8 percent in the year to September 2005, driven by
increased activities in the manufacturing, minerals and construction sectors, following a
decline of 0.4 percent in 2004. Private sector employment is expected to continue to
increase, given the expected growth of total GDP in 2006 and over the medium-term.
The outlook for 2006 and over the medium-term looks promising, with growth of 3.5 percent
expected in 2006 and is broad based across all sectors. There are a number of promising
resource projects coming into construction, notably the PNG to Australia Gas Project
followed by the Ramu Nickel Mine, which are expected to contribute strongly to growth.

Enhanced Fiscal Discipline
The fiscal position also continues the steady reduction in the deficit levels that the
Government announced in 2002, as part of its MTFS and medium-term debt reduction
strategy.
The fiscal outturn for 2005 is likely to be 0.6 percent of GDP or even better, compared with
the original projected deficit of 0.9 percent of GDP. This outcome is due to continued
disciplined expenditure management and improved revenue performance. This will be the
third year in succession that the fiscal outturn has been in line with, or better than, the MTFS.
For 2006, the budgeted deficit of 0.6 percent is again in line with the MTFS.
As noted by the staff, savings from lower interest payments have been re-allocated to
reducing arrears and other outstanding obligations, and to priority spending areas identified
in the MTDS. My authorities have also successfully restricted windfall revenue gains from
temporary increases in commodity prices from being transmitted into an unsustainable
increase in recurrent expenditure. The Government has set aside K400 million ($US128.0
million) to part fund the Government’s minority equity share in the PNG to Australia Gas
Project, which it sees as an important asset that will deliver a stream of revenue for many
years in the future. This action reduces the Government’s borrowing requirements to finance
its share of the gas project. My authorities have also reaffirmed their intention not to contract
non-concessional loans to finance its equity share. The Government is working closely with
the ADB to secure ADB financing for the remaining equity in the project.
Significant improvements in fiscal management have contributed to a further reduction in
total public sector debt to 49 percent of GDP in 2005, from an unsustainable level of 72
percent in 2002. Total public sector debt is budgeted to fall to 46 percent of GDP in 2006.
As set out in the staff report, the Government has recently developed a medium-term strategy
for debt management. In line with this strategy, PNG has been seeking to lengthen the
maturity of its debt portfolio. While it has noted the Fund’s caution on this issue and intends
to avoid any inordinate rise in interest costs, the Government has been seeking to manage
interest rate and rollover risks associated with the still relatively short maturity structure of its
domestic debt portfolio. My authorities acknowledge the staff’s debt sustainability analysis
and agree with the need to continue prudent macroeconomic policies and reforms. They also
recognize the downside risks, including those highlighted by the staff, which could curtail the
outlook for fiscal and debt sustainability.
In his 2006 Budget Speech, the Minister for Finance and Treasury assured that the
Government would continue to provide policy stability by working within the parameters of
the MTFS and MTDS, which the Government has followed in recent years and will continue
to follow. In fact, the Minister acknowledges that if macroeconomic management slips, and
the reform efforts falter, then the outlook for 2006 and the future years will also be gloomy.
Reforms in the fiscal area have been ongoing as well, although the process has been slow.
Financial controllers and internal audit units are now established in large spending agencies,

-4-

including Defence, Police, Health and Education, to strengthen expenditure control and
financial discipline. My authorities agree with the staff that more needs to be done to
improve governance and accountability to strengthen public expenditure management.
Monetary Policy and Financial Sector Supervision
Monetary policy has eased substantially over the past two years, in line with lower inflation
and inflationary expectations. The accommodative policy stance is being supported by the
Government’s prudent fiscal management and favorable external conditions, which
strengthened the exchange rate position and curbed price pressures.
The stable macroeconomic and political conditions, as well as high liquidity have caused
private sector credit to pick up for the first time in four years, increasing by around 20
percent in 2005 from a low base.
The Bank of Papua New Guinea (BPNG) has reaffirmed its commitment that monetary
policy will remain accommodative while inflation pressures remain subdued. Money market
interest rates have been below BPNG’s official indicator rate for a considerable period, so
liquidity conditions will have to be managed closely by the Bank going forward. The
Government will also need to support this through a continuation of prudent fiscal policy,
and acceleration of ongoing structural reforms to increase productivity.
As set out in the staff report, the regulatory and supervisory framework for the central bank,
commercial banks, non-bank financial institutions, superannuation funds and life insurance
companies have been strengthened, resulting in improved financial sector soundness. Much
of financial sector reform has been completed, with steps now being taken to complete the
overall reform agenda, including the implementation of the Fund’s technical assistance
recommendations on financial sector supervision.
The Government has also stepped in to revive the deteriorating Rural Development Bank
(RDB), declared insolvent in July 2004 because of poor management and weak governance.
In an effort to improve the governance arrangement, new legislation has been submitted to
the Parliament for approval in early 2006. The new legislation intends to allow the RDB to
operate on commercial grounds, while maintaining its core objective of providing banking
service for the rural sector. The RDB is likely to come under the prudential supervision of
BPNG, if licensed to operate as an authorized bank. Given the RDB is now likely to have
wider commercial operations, the authorities will need to keep these new arrangements under
close review given the governance risks.
Structural Reform and Private Sector Development
As set out in both the MTFS and the MTDS, the Government considers improving the
climate for private sector investment to be a first order priority. While favourable
commodity prices are boosting the petroleum and minerals sectors, it is imperative to widen
development potential in other sectors such as agriculture, tourism and services, if economic

-5-

gains are to translate into employment gains across the regions and the community more
generally. The three elements of the Government’s strategy to support private sector
development and growth are:
•
•
•

A stable investment climate.
An efficient, effective and affordable public sector.
Creating a competitive and dynamic private sector.

As already noted, political stability is fundamental for a stable investment climate. This
needs to be maintained throughout the 2007 election processes. Setting out clear plans under
the MTFS and MTDS are also essential ingredients that the Government is following. The
benefits of this framework have resulted in low inflation and interest rates, a stable exchange
rate, steady economic growth, improving investment trends and employment creation.
In terms of a more efficient public sector, the report of the Rightsizing review calls for a
more streamlined public service concentrating on declining core government functions, and
detailing where changes need to be made. Implementation will be difficult, but the
Government will take forward some of these reforms in 2006. Given the importance of the
benefits of achieving a more efficient public service and reallocating resources to MTDS
priorities, it will be important for the Government to push ahead with these reforms.
My authorities agree with the Fund’s advice that accelerated implementation of the MTDS is
needed to address remaining structural shortcomings in the public sector hampering the
private sector. In the 2006 Budget, the Government has increased resources going to priority
areas, including for the rehabilitation and maintenance of roads, law and order, primary
education and health. The roll-out of the District Services Improvement Program will also be
important across the regions for improving infrastructure for commerce and agricultural
development. In all these areas, it will be crucial to achieve appropriate implementation,
monitoring and reporting against budget appropriations and development plans.
The third element of the Government’s strategy is creating a competitive and dynamic
private sector, where the Government is addressing various areas that impede business.
There have been improvements in the performance of larger public enterprises, but more
needs to be done, particularly on the corporate governance arrangements and the regulatory
framework within which they operate. In particular, the Government will be asking the
Independent Competition and Consumer Commission (ICCC) to examine the regulatory
changes needed for the transition to a more competitive telecommunications market when the
telecommunications monopoly expires in 2007.
The Government will also be looking at options to improve the services provided to business
and consumers by other (public and private) utility providers. Competition within coastal
shipping will be examined by the ICCC to assess the merits of strengthening competition and
regulatory control. Regulatory impediments around air transport will also be reviewed with a
view to increasing competition and reducing air transport costs.

My authorities will continue to implement the recent review of PNG’s investment regime
with a view to streamlining investment regulations and processes to remove unnecessary
impediments to investment. In addition, the National Working Group on Business
Impediments has made substantial inroads into removing red tape and bureaucratic
bottlenecks that impede private sector development. The BPNG has also liberalized foreign
exchange controls in June 2005 to support private sector investment.
