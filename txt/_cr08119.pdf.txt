PHILIPPINES
Staff Report for the 2007 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2007 Consultation with the Philippines
Approved by David T. Coe and Michael Hadjimichael
February 19, 2008
• Discussions: Manila, November 29–December 11, 2007. The mission met: Finance Secretary Teves,
Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) Governor Tetangco, Budget Management Secretary Andaya,
Energy Secretary Reyes, other senior government officials, and private sector representatives.
• Team: Messrs. I. Lee (head), Faulkner-MacDonagh, Ms. Fujita (all APD), Messrs. Botman (FAD),
Halikias (PDR), and Baqir (Resident Representative). Mr. Takeda (APD) joined the mission during
December 6–11. Ms. Mañalac (OED) also participated. An MCM technical assistance mission on
debt management overlapped with the Article IV discussions.
• Focus of the consultation: Reducing vulnerabilities and securing a durable foundation for growth.
• Selected issues: Investment incentives and effective tax rates; measurement of the output gap; and
overview of the international investment position from an asset/liability management perspective.
• Outreach: The mission held a press conference on December 11, which was well-attended and
received extensive local coverage. The mission met: Senator Villar (President), chairs of the Senate
Ways and Means and Finance committees, House Speaker De Venecia, and chairs of the House
Ways and Means and Appropriations committees to explain the need to raise fiscal revenue.
• Exchange rate policies: Largely market determined. The Philippines has accepted obligations
under Article VIII, sections 2, 3, and 4 and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on
payments and transfers for current international transactions.
• Context of past surveillance: The authorities and staff agreed broadly on the thrust of policies—
progress in fiscal consolidation, prudent monetary regime aimed at anchoring inflation
expectations and building international reserves, and sustained reforms of banking supervision
and the financial system. Political constraints have held back a full legislative package that
would enhance monetary and financial policy management.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The economic performance and outlook has improved markedly over the past few years.
Founded on fiscal consolidation, investor confidence revived; strong remittance income led a
surge in balance of payment inflows. Faced with a less favorable global outlook, the
Philippines needs to further reduce vulnerability and place growth on a firmer footing.
Medium-term growth prospects are favorable, although subject to global economic
uncertainties. Upgrading public infrastructure, regarded as a key bottleneck, would catalyze
private investment and provide a rebound in domestic employment.
There has been a marked turnaround in fiscal accounts. Performance of public enterprises
has improved, and the national government has lowered its deficit through expenditure
restraint and VAT reform in 2006. However, the success in revenue collection from VAT
reform was short lived, and a key priority is to reverse the weakening revenue collection.
New tax measures and continued collection efforts would be essential to finance needed
infrastructure without weakening fiscal discipline. Implementation will take time. Hence,
the planned balanced budget in 2008 will have to rely on expenditure-driven consolidation.
Inflation remained low because of an appreciating peso and prudent monetary policy.
Intervention to smooth fluctuations and scale up buffers for increased currency flows resulted
in a rapid increase in foreign reserves. The latter were sterilized successfully by widening
access to the Special Deposit Account. Continuing the policy mix of easing rates, capital
account liberalization, and early repayments of external debt is appropriate. Greater pesodenominated financing would reduce exposure to exchange rate risks.
Banking soundness has improved substantially. Non-performing assets were reduced
without government support, and risk management facilities have been upgraded as Basel II
is phased in. Yet, some banks remain exposed to interest rate risks. Efforts should focus now
on lifting bank performance, which could be facilitated by passage of bills on creating a
credit bureau and reforming insolvency rules. Amending the BSP charter would help
strengthen bank supervision, monetary policy operations, and economic surveillance.
Privatization has attracted large interest from investors. Around 40 percent of power
generating capacity has been sold to date. The firmer peso and smaller external debt service
payments helped partially offset the effect of higher commodity prices on the performance of
public enterprises. However, efforts should continue in finding efficiencies.

The political situation remains stable. A December security incident, where only a
small group of rebel soldiers took over a tourist hotel for a few hours calling for President
Arroyo’s resignation, received little public support.
3.
However, growing uncertainty over the global outlook adds urgency to strengthening
reform momentum to cement recent gains. Ongoing turmoil in the financial markets portends
tighter credit, and a possible global slowdown presages weaker external demand. Although the
Philippines is better prepared than during previous turns of the business cycle, risks could be
further reduced and growth placed more on a sustainable path. Thus, the Article IV discussions
centered on further reducing vulnerabilities and providing a durable foundation for growth.
ECONOMIC BACKGROUND
Background
4.

Economic activity accelerated while inflation stayed low (Figure 1).

•

GDP rose 7¼ percent (annual average)
in 2007. Private consumption firmed as
remittances remained strong, part of
which financed home purchases. Fiscal
impetus from government spending,
including on infrastructure, provided an
added push to growth. Despite tentative
signs of a pick up, overall investment is
still very low by regional standards,
contributing to a large private savinginvestment surplus.

Services drove growth. With
strengthening domestic demand, the
service sector grew 8½ percent through
the third quarter (y-on-y). A
construction boom continued with
strong demand for residential
condominiums from overseas workers,
as well as for commercial office space
from outsourcing businesses. Forestry
and mining operations expanded in
response to high commodity prices and
legal reforms introduced in 2004 that
allowed foreigners to enter into longterm mining contracts with Philippine
landowners.
Price pressures remained muted.
Headline CPI inflation was only
2.8 percent (annual average) in 2007,
aided by an appreciating peso and
prudent monetary policy.

Favorable conditions led to a surge in inflows. Although the trade deficit was large,
the current account surplus was 5½ percent of GDP in the first half of 2007 (Figure 2)
on high levels of transfers from overseas workers. Tighter spreads on Philippine debt
lowered interest payments, and portfolio inflows turned the financial account into a
small surplus. The peso appreciated 16 percent against the U.S. dollar since end-2006
(9¼ percent on a real effective basis through October). Reserves at the Bangko
Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) reached $33¾ billion by end-December, compared with
$23 billion a year earlier.

•

To date, fallout from turmoil in the global
financial markets has been limited.
Philippine spreads rose as much as in
other emerging markets and stabilized
somewhat quicker as conditions
normalized, suggesting distress no longer
automatically raises a red flag as in the
past. Even with heightened global risk
aversion since mid-2007, foreign
investors have remained active, with
gross portfolio flows still high.

The domestic financial system felt few reverberations. Throughout the summer, the
Philippine money markets functioned with little signs of distress. At end-July, banks
held around $1¾ billion (1¾ percent of asset or 15¾ percent of capital) in Credit
Linked Notes (CLNs) and less than $¹⁄5 billion in Collateralized Debt Obligations
(CDOs). These, along with dollar denominated government bonds, incurred mark-tomarket losses of just over $110 million when spreads rose. By end-September,
however, these losses were erased as interest rates subsequently fell.

Outlook and risks
5.
The economy is expected to enter 2008 with considerable momentum. Staff
forecasts GDP growth of 6 percent for 2008, as fiscal impetus wanes. Net exports would
contribute less to growth, reflecting a projected mark-down of global growth for the first half
of the year.
6.
Economic growth prospects are subject to growing downside risk with the unfolding
uncertainties in the global financial market. Remittance income, particularly from workers
based in non-dollar linked economies, could remain strong, and a sustained increase in
investment could lift growth further. On the other hand, a sharper-than-expected global
slowdown and credit crunch could undermine recent gains through a disorderly unwinding of
currency flows, including possibly a sizable drop in workers remittances. Further increases in
food and oil prices could weigh on consumer spending and push up inflation, and a large jump
in the peso could dampen exports. However, improved fundamentals, prudent macroeconomic
policies, and a strong reserve position should help the economy weather such shocks.
7.

The medium-term outlook is broadly positive.

•

Baseline. Reforms to date would
allow the economy to operate at
a modestly higher pace of growth
than in the past. With fiscal
deficits under control, business
sentiment would remain positive
and spur private investment to
expand beyond the housing
rebound. The ample liquidity
would provide relatively easy
access to financing. Yet, without
any further revenue effort,
government will be unable to
meet their priority targets in the
medium-term expenditure
framework. Thus, poor
infrastructure will increasingly
pose a bottleneck. On the other

hand, buoyant domestic demand would lift imports, and with workers’ remittances
leveling off, the saving-investment balance would normalize.
•

Reform scenario. Under the staff’s “reform scenario,” tax policies would be
introduced that would strengthen the tax base, allowing higher capital and social
spending. The expectation of better infrastructure in the medium term would catalyze
private investment in the short run and throughout the period, leading to a rebound in
domestic employment and a reduction in emigration. In addition, private capital
inflows, led by foreign direct investment (FDI), would prompt a faster adjustment in
the external balance toward its longer-term norm.

The authorities’ views and policy discussions
8.
The authorities also forecast robust growth in the short term, and a more buoyant
outlook for the medium term, corresponding to the staff’s strong reform scenario. The
authorities’ latest growth target for 2008 is 6.3–7.0 percent. Through 2010, the official
government plan calls for a marked increase in infrastructure spending, to 4 percent of GDP.
There was a shared view between the staff and the authorities that such a rebound in public
investment would help drive a pickup in private activity, both in the short term and especially
into the medium term. The authorities took a similar view to the staff that the fallout from the
recent upheavals in the financial markets has been limited.
I. MENDING VULNERABILITIES AND SECURING A SUSTAINABLE GROWTH PATH
9.
Discussions focused on further reducing vulnerabilities and building a solid platform
for growth (Box 1). The policy discussions were framed around a broad assessment of external
stability, focusing especially on an assessment of the exchange rate level, balance sheet
vulnerabilities, and sectoral saving-investment balances.
•

Fiscal policy: Meeting social and infrastructure needs, while balancing the budget to
demonstrate fiscal prudence, would require a more sustained tax effort and a
prioritization of expenditure within a medium-term framework. Shifting towards local
currency debt would reduce vulnerability.

•

Monetary policy: Maintaining the current policy mix of a flexible exchange rate,
sterilized intervention, lowering policy rates, and capital account liberalization
appears appropriate given the strong currency inflows and benign inflation outlook.

•

Private sector development: Legislative changes are needed to lock in the benefits
from the substantial improvement in banking supervision and to secure a better
functioning financial system. The ongoing privatization program would further
improve the fiscal position and rationalize government operations.

8
Box 1. Vulnerability Assessment
Over the past several years, the Philippines has made substantial progress addressing long-standing
fiscal, external, and financial sector vulnerabilities. Ongoing economic reforms have put debt on a
steadily declining path, rendering positive debt dynamics. In the general government sector, the decline in
the ratio of external debt to GDP reflects sustained fiscal consolidation and debt buybacks. In the nonbank public sector, debt prepayments of power utilities have also been significant.
The markets have responded positively to this improvement in debt fundamentals. Since 2001, Philippine
EMBI spreads have fallen by around 500 basis points and moved more closely with the overall index. Lower
domestic interest rates have left debt relatively insensitive to increases in interest rates.

However, the currency and maturity structure of
public debt remains a cause for concern. The share
of public debt exposed to exchange rate risk is well
above the emerging market average. A plausible
30 percent depreciation would lift ratios
substantially (Appendix I). In addition, the maturity
structure of public debt remains tilted toward the
short end, almost three times the emerging market
average. This renders the debt dynamics vulnerable
to a deterioration in investor sentiment.

Despite the impressive progress in reducing nonperforming assets, banks still struggle with low profitability and high exposure to government debt.
Over the past four years, the Special Purpose Vehicle law and its successor have allowed banks to sharply
reduce the outstanding stock of nonperforming assets without relying on public funds. However, the share
of nonperforming loans is still almost twice the emerging market average. The rate of return on assets
remains low, as a large number of banks have difficulty in determining good credit risks. With large
holdings of sovereign debt, banks lost just over $100 million when spreads increased sharply in end-July.
While the losses were subsequently recouped, banks could suffer more significantly if spreads again
widened.

9

A. Securing the Benefits from Fiscal Consolidation
Background
10.

Despite recent gains in the fiscal position, additional tax efforts are needed.

•

There has been a remarkable turnaround in the fiscal accounts (Figure 3).
Nonfinancial public sector debt is projected at about 64 percent in 2007 (from a peak
of over 100 percent of GDP in 2003) because of improved performance of
Government Owned or Controlled Corporations (GOCCs) and the Social Security
Institutions (SSIs), lower central government deficit owing to the 2006 VAT reform,
and several years of expenditure restraint. External factors also contributed, such as
peso appreciation and lower interest rates. Better performance of the GOCCs reflects
policy changes, most notably in the power sector, and for SSIs, higher contributions.

•

However, the momentum gained in revenue collection from the VAT reform was short
lived. The government deficit widened to about 1½ percent of GDP in 2007 as
expected improvements in tax administration did not materialize, while there was a
welcomed pickup in public investment. While the deficit is likely to be fully financed
by privatization receipts, no progress was made in further reducing the debt-torevenue ratio, which is high relative to other countries.

•

The 2008 budget relies on expenditure-driven consolidation. New tax policy
measures are minimal. The authorities again count on significant gains from stronger
tax administration, which may take more time to materialize. Relative to 2007,
infrastructure spending is set to fall as a share of GDP. Civil service reform is
progressing, and most departments and GOCCs have submitted their rationalization
proposals. Any saving is currently scheduled to be channeled to higher operating
expenditures of implementing agencies.

Policy issues and staff views
11.

High priority should be placed on regaining the momentum in tax collection.

•

It is difficult to identify a single cause
for the decline in tax receipts.
Possibilities include: election-related
tax evasion, discontent in the ranks of
the revenue agencies, decline in
compliance from repeated amnesties
(which aimed to improve taxpayer
registration), lifting of the VAT input
cap, peso appreciation, and higher
smuggling despite better screening
technology at Customs.

Staff recommended focusing on strengthening the tax base (Box 2). Significant gains
could be made through streamlining tax incentives, as proposed by the Department of
Finance (DoF). Staff also argued for increasing and indexing select excises to
inflation to at least partly recoup revenue lost over the past decade, amounting to
1½ percent of GDP. These tax policy measures, together with accelerated reforms at
GOCCs (see below) form the basis for staff’s strong reform scenario, leading to
higher public, and, over time, private investment and growth.

•

Reforming the pay-for-performance system at the revenue agencies would be effective
only if coupled with deeper reforms. Higher pay should be based on a broad set of
performance indicators. For pay reform to be meaningful, it will be important to first
identify and address fundamental systemic weaknesses, including the lack of an
effective and systemic control process of filing and payments.

have yet to be identified. A dearth of public
investment—roads and irrigation by the government and power and other infrastructure by
GOCCs—is frequently mentioned as a barrier to FDI.
13.
Staff suggested anchoring policies more firmly in a medium term fiscal framework
and improving public-financial management. This could help policy makers better develop a
debt management strategy. Staff welcomed the intention to set expenditure plans for Local
Government Units (LGUs) in a medium-term context, which should reduce LGU concerns over
cash releases and contribute to increased social spending. The authorities intend to improve
budget execution and cash management, which will help better track social spending.

The authorities plan to balance the 2008 budget while at the same time beefing up
priority spending.
•

The priority in 2008 is to balance the budget to cement investor confidence. To the
extent that additional revenue may not be forthcoming in the short term, expenditure
restraint would be inevitable. However, spending cuts would be across the board, rather
than only on capital expenditure. If revenue exceeded targets or saving emerged from

Box 2. Options for Establishing a Durable Tax Base
Tax collection has trended markedly lower over the last decade in the Philippines. Key reasons
include: generous tax incentives, tariff reform, and a gradual erosion of excise revenue due to nonindexation. This changed in 2006, with the successful implementation of the VAT reform and tentative
signs of improvements in tax administration. In 2007, however, the collection momentum slowed again
at both the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) and Bureau of Customs (BoC). This slowdown needs to be
reversed to fund priority spending and further reduce fiscal vulnerabilities.

Raising and indexing excises. Revenue from
fuel, cigarettes, and alcohol has declined by about
1½ percent of GDP since 1997, largely because
most excises are not indexed to inflation (see
second chart). Periodic rate increases for cigarettes
and alcohol have not protected the revenue base—
a task made more complicated by a four-tier rate
system on tobacco. By unifying these rates, and
raising and indexing excise rates, policymakers
could recover revenue lost over the past decade.

Accelerating tax administration reform. There is
ample scope for improvements in administration.
After gains in 2006 from the VAT reform, which
raised the rate to 12 percent and expanded the base,
VAT productivity declined in 2007 and remains
low compared to other countries (see first chart).
The authorities’ reform priorities at the BIR
include: taxpayer registration, arrears collection,
and improving audits. At the BoC, a
comprehensive reform agenda is lacking. However,
based on previous FAD recommendations,
priorities include: strengthening management
controls and the integrity of import and export
clearance system; and upgrading enforcement and
intelligence functions.

lower interest costs or from civil service reform, staff suggested higher public works
spending, as in 2007; the authorities agreed, provided that the spending is covered by
appropriations. Staff also agreed that after 2009, modest deficits could be tolerated to
make room for higher social and capital spending provided tax efforts are sustained.
•

The government is targeting higher capital and social spending. The authorities
agreed that privatization is only a short-term measure, and that their MTEF would
require 1½ percent of GDP additional revenue efforts. In this regard, the DoF looked
forward to passage of revenue-enhancing fiscal bills.

•

In meetings with legislators, staff shared results of alternative tax reform scenarios
and answered questions on bills under consideration. The mission cautioned against
proposals that would narrow, rather than broaden, the tax base. Key legislators and
DoF officials agreed with staff that the decline in excise revenue needs to be reversed
and tax incentives reformed.

15.
Public-private partnerships (PPPs) will continue. The cumulative value of PPP projects
has grown to around 12 percent of GDP. The authorities foresaw additional PPPs as part of plans
to expand capital spending. Staff cautioned against promoting PPPs purely as a means of fiscal
saving and recommended installing a single unit in the DoF in charge of monitoring and
approving all outstanding guarantees, a suggestion which was welcomed by the authorities.

The authorities aided an orderly adjustment in the exchange rate.

•

The strong balance of payments reflected largely an increase in remittances and, to a
lesser extent, net capital inflows. In response, the peso appreciated significantly vis-àvis the U.S. dollar and in nominal effective terms (by 14¼ percent during 2007),
notwithstanding the large buildup of gross reserves by the authorities. The authorities
also intervened to smooth fluctuations of the peso along a firming trend, with no
exchange rate objective. Gross reserves, inclusive of swap positions, doubled in 2007
to reach $44½ billion by year end. The authorities also prepaid external debt and
relaxed limits on investment abroad in two stages.1

In April 2007, the BSP raised the limit on investment abroad (allowed without prior BSP approval), from

liberalization removed even more restrictions and raised the annual investment limits to $30 million. Banks also

•

More broadly, policy should respond flexibly if capital inflows were to strengthen
significantly. With Philippine interbank rates still modestly higher than comparable
rates abroad, there is some scope to further ease policy should inflows strengthen.
However, rising food prices in the region and higher oil prices internationally pose
upside risks to the inflation outlook and warrant caution.

Box 3. Assessment of the Level of the Exchange Rate
Tentative staff estimates indicate the
current level of the peso is broadly in
line with fundamentals. The latest
CGER estimates, after adjusting for
multilateral consistency, range from an
undervaluation of 13–14 percent to an
overvaluation of 6 percent. While the
magnitudes are somewhat different, the
mission team’s estimates approximate
those of the CGER (see text table). The
narrowing of the undervaluation from
last year appears to be due to the
strengthening of the peso, which in real
effective terms appreciated by 15
percent (y-o-y) through mid-2007.

Based on medium-term projections through 2012.

The underlying current account surplus is estimated to be about 0.4 percent of GDP. This
is based on the assumption that the following temporary and cyclical factors have played out:
(i) portfolio-type flows in tandem with the overall reflow to Asia that started in 2005-06
(about 2 percent of GDP); (ii) a slowdown in workers going abroad in response to somewhat
faster domestic GDP growth (about 1 percent of GDP), and (iii) a pick up in capital goods
and oil imports, in response to improved investor confidence and the expected stay of the
further hike of petroleum prices in early 2008 over the medium term. Imports may have also
been low in 2007 from possible under-recording due to election-related lenience this year
(potentially as much as 2 percent of GDP).
Notwithstanding the relatively large margins of error surrounding such estimates, the
mission’s tentative assessment is that the current level of peso is broadly in equilibrium.

16
19.
The government could adjust its borrowing mix, with greater financing from pesodenominated bonds, to reduce exposure to exchange rate risks. The Philippines is
somewhat of an outlier: foreign currency borrowings are large and, unlike in many Latin
American countries, the share has not fallen in recent years. Greater issuance in pesos would
reduce vulnerabilities and improve standings with ratings agencies. However, it would be
prudent to maintain a modest foreign currency presence in international markets to allow the
authorities to tap external funding sources if the need arose. These moves could also be part
of a broader strategy to help reduce pressures on the peso.
The authorities’ views and policy discussions
20.

Emergent pressures will condition whether the easing cycle continues.

•

The firm peso has helped temper the impact of higher import costs, particularly from
resurgent food and oil prices. There was a shared view that wider access to the SDA
had helped reduce liquidity growth. Exceptional spikes in commodity prices were
being watched closely for signs of second round effects on domestic prices and for
evidence that higher costs have not dislodged inflation expectations.

•

The authorities also saw risks to the global inflation outlook. Recent measures
adopted by central banks to cope with seizures in the money markets have pumped a
large amount of cash into the global financial system. Once conditions normalize, this
liquidity could swamp markets with liquidity and add to price pressures.

21.

The authorities remain committed to a flexible exchange rate system.

•

BSP officials emphasized that the exchange rate is market determined. Intervention is
aimed at smoothing volatility of the peso. Staff questioned to what extent the
exchange rate was managed in light of the large reserve accumulation. The authorities
emphasized that they took the opportunity of favorable market conditions of low
inflation and stronger balance of payments position to strategically build up reserves,
and thereby reduce the country’s vulnerability. Beyond that, the peso was left to the
market. While other central banks accumulated reserves several years ago, the BSP
has not had a similar opportunity

until recently. Now, they plan to

authorities agreed that the current level of the real effective exchange rate is broadly in
line with fundamentals. However, they expressed concern about possible
overvaluation in the future. The appreciating peso has adversely affected locally
sourced exporters and overseas foreign workers, and both have scaled up complaints.
•

Staff supported the BSP’s exchange rate policy and decision to continue using a mix of
measures to moderate the impact of capital inflows on the economy, weighing costs and
benefits of each measure. The second round of foreign exchange liberalization was
particularly important because it has facilitated free capital flows in an increasingly
integrated market, which could also alleviate pressures on the exchange rate.

22.
The authorities agreed that greater domestic borrowing would encourage local
capital market development and reduce external vulnerabilities. DoF officials announced that
more borrowing would be sourced locally, in pesos, with only $500 million in offshore
commercial borrowing in 2008. The mission supported this shift, which would help gradually
reduce exposure to currency risk—a source of vulnerability discussed in the DSA (Appendix I).
At the same time, staff also suggested lengthening maturities to decrease rollover risk.
C. Financial and Structural Policies
Background
23.

While challenges remain, the financial system has begun to turn the corner (Figure 4).

•

Banks upgraded risk management facilities ahead of the July 2007 introduction of
Basel II. These included higher risk weights on non-performing assets (NPAs), new
charges for operational risk, and a 100 percent weight (phased-in over three years) on
Philippine foreign currency sovereign bonds.

•

The extension of the Special Purpose Vehicle Law has allowed a disposal of nearly
P130 billion in distressed assets. An improving property market has also helped
banks unload foreclosed properties.

•

Surveillance over banks has improved. BSP auditing functions have recently been
overhauled, focusing on bank inspections, diagnostic accounting, and a clearer
delineation of responsibilities within the BSP on oversight.

•

Large holdings of government debt render banks vulnerable to sharp spikes of
sovereign spread risk. Lack of good lending prospects, along with high reserve and
liquidity requirements and the difficulty in taking legal action against defaulters, have
led banks to place around one-third of assets in government securities. However,
banks’ direct holdings of structured debt instruments are around 1¾ percent of assets.

18
•

Critical legislation has stalled. Despite repeated attempts, Congress has not passed
bills that would: improve the credit reporting system; permit a broader range of
investments, including real estate investment trusts; reform insolvency rules; and
amend the BSP charter that would strengthen, inter alia, legal protection to bank
supervisors and inspectors, enhance data collection, and allow the BSP to issue debt.

24.
Good progress has been made in power sector reforms, and efforts for rationalization
of other GOCCs have begun.
•

With improved investor confidence,
power sector privatization made good
progress in 2007. To date, over
40 percent of power generating
capacity has been sold. A government
owned power transmission
corporation, the National
Transmission Corporation (Transco),
was successfully auctioned in
December after repeated past failures.

•

GOCCs and SSIs had a good year in 2006 and in the first three quarters of 2007. The
appreciation of the peso helped mitigate higher oil prices and reduce external debt
service payments. The National Power Corporation (NPC) is expected to record a
small surplus in 2007 with higher sales. SSIs benefited from a strong stock market
and an increase in payroll receipts after contribution rates were increased and more
overseas workers contributed to the system.

•

However, selected GOCCs are still under strain. The National Food Authority (NFA)
and Light Rail Transit Authority (LRTA) have substantial, although declining,
deficits stemming from cost increases and low cost recovery.

Policy issues and staff views
25.
There appears to be little impact, to date, of the turbulence in global markets on the
Philippine financial system. To be certain, portfolio inflows have tapered off and spreads
have risen, but not disproportionately. Bank shares have been depressed, particularly for
those holding large amounts of government bonds, and thus exposed to large changes in
spreads. Continued vigilance is thus warranted, particularly if risk aversion builds or
inflation picks up, leading to more adjustment in yields.
26.
With vulnerability reduced, promoting effective financial intermediation emerges
as a key challenge. Despite substantial progress in reducing NPAs, they remain large and
depress bank profits. Bank lending remains low, well below funds raised in the capital

19
market in 2007, as banks are willing to lend to only their best clients. The credit reporting
system is poor, only 5½ percent of adults are currently covered, and an inefficient
bankruptcy code extends recovery time to 5¾ years and reduces recovery rates to
4¼ percent. Enactment of a full legislative package would help expand access to credit for
small and medium-sized enterprises, reduce external borrowing, and encourage investment. 3
27.
The staff welcomed efforts to further strengthen the BSP’s supervision and
surveillance capacity. The staff recognized that training and reorganization of the BSP’s
Supervision and Examination Sector was well underway. Reforms, including a new Prompt
Corrective Action framework and close collaboration with the Philippine Deposit Insurance
Corporation, have empowered auditors to track banks’ activities more closely. The mission
urged BSP staff to keep monitoring developments in the property sector closely. Staff also
welcomed the ongoing work within the BSP on the inaugural Financial Stability Report. The
first report would be published this year, although only internally, as a dry-run.
28.
The staff reviewed the GOCCs fiscal position and its durability. Staff welcomed
plans to introduce performance contracts and medium-term deficit targets for GOCCs
representing high fiscal risk, starting with the NFA.
The authorities’ views and policy discussions
29.
BSP staff emphasized that the banking system was relatively well prepared to
withstand a tightening of the global credit cycle. Internal stress tests suggested that
systemically important banks could comfortably withstand further widening of sovereign
spreads. Furthermore, exposure to CDOs and underlying assets of CLNs were investment
grade credits. However, widening spreads have led to mark-to-market losses, which have
been manageable, and a few non-systemic banks may be vulnerable if government bond
yields rose sharply.
30.

Further legislative changes and reform efforts are important.

•

The BSP Charter Amendment is critical. The delay in the passage of the law has
required the BSP to offer indemnity insurance to its supervisory staff, reducing the fear
of lawsuits, as a temporary alternative. The amendment would also allow the BSP to
issue its own debt and give more power to collect data on the non-bank sector for its
surveillance activities. Cooperation with the Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation
(PDIC) has enabled the BSP to take action against some banks.

3

The Corporate Recovery Act would aid creditors in a speedy liquidation of a borrower’s assets. The Credit
Information Systems Act would establish a publicly-charted corporation (with the BSP holding a 40 percent
equity stake) to collect credit information (similar to private credit bureaus in other countries).

20
•

Internal reorganization in bank supervision has made headway. The process of
improving management within the BSP has been difficult. Human capital skills have
been upgraded through very short-term secondment at offshore investment and
commercial banks.

31.
While recognizing the banking system could be more efficient, the authorities
emphasized significant work has begun in this area.
•

Process of bank restructuring is ongoing. The reduction in NPAs has occurred
entirely through a private-sector led framework, with no public funds used for
bailouts. Moreover, banks have been consolidating. Basel II implementation,
preparation for which began several years ago, has forced higher provisioning and
greater attention to risk. The improved property market, however, has increased the
value of the Real and Other Property Acquired, reducing the provisioning
requirements. The BSP has also been active in promoting micro credit and SME
lending programs.

•

Capital market development is proceeding apace. There have been welcome moves
toward deepening domestic bond and equity markets. This has meant greater
corporate reliance on security issuances over bank lending.

•

The BSP is not overly concerned about banks’ increased lending to the property
sector. Strict exposure limits prevent real estate lending from exceeding 30 percent of
loan portfolios. Related party lending is also limited to 20 percent of portfolio.
Moreover, recent demand for property mainly reflects acquiring dwellings for
ownership, rather than speculative investment.

32.

The process of more fundamental reforms of the GOCCs is underway.

•

With ADB technical assistance, the government is currently setting up a framework of
performance contracts for GOCCs, mainly for the National Development Company,
the LRTA, the Philippine National Railways, and the Home Guarantee Corporation.

•

The authorities are completing the framework for streamlining the operations and
strengthening the management of the NFA. However, the scope for saving may be
limited since most of the NFA’s deficit is driven by factors outside its control, such as
the administratively-set rice price and subsidies for school food programs.
STAFF APPRAISAL

33.
The Philippine economy is reaping the benefits of reforms, but further progress is
required as uncertainties in the global outlook grow. Sustained fiscal prudence has helped
to erase chronic public deficits. Bank supervision has been substantially strengthened, and
the banking system’s health improved. Markets have taken note, resulting in readily available

21
financing for the current expansion. However, attention should now turn to address
infrastructure bottlenecks and social needs and to strengthen the financial sector’s ability to
efficiently channel resources, including from foreign currency inflows.
34.
Already, much has been done to streamline the public sector. The government’s
privatization program has attracted strong investor interest. The 2006 tax reform has improved
the VAT’s efficiency. These improvements, together with tight control over spending and
improved performance of GOCCs, have slashed the public sector deficit and improved the
Philippines’ debt dynamics further. The government’s plan to maintain a balanced budget
through 2008, as a demonstration of fiscal prudence, should further cement credibility.
35.
However, there is an urgent need to raise the tax effort to place priority spending
on a sustainable footing. Balancing the budget and reaching targets for social and capital
spending will require additional tax effort of at least 1½ percent of GDP over the medium
term. While administrative reforms will help, legislation is needed to restore the tax base by
rationalizing fiscal incentives and by adjusting excise taxes. Although PPPs are useful, plans
to more closely monitor these projects, particularly guarantees extended to private investors,
would help the government manage its exposure and further reduce fiscal risks.
36.
The authorities managed the foreign exchange inflows well, while maintaining
price stability. The authorities have smoothed peso fluctuations as they took a strategic
opportunity to build reserves, which now appear adequate. There was a compelling case to
raise the level of reserves, and staff continue to view the exchange rate as market determined.
Wider access to the Special Deposit Account, together with operations through the Reverse
Repurchase facility and greater use of swaps, have successfully sterilized the reserves
buildup and reduced liquidity growth. Well-anchored inflation expectations and an
appreciating peso have helped counter the effects of sharply higher commodity prices into
2008. If the inflation outlook remained comfortable, and capital inflows continued to put
pressure on the peso, there could be scope for further easing. Nevertheless, higher regional
food and oil prices warrant caution.
37.
The underlying current account balance is slightly larger than the norm,
suggesting the exchange rate is broadly in equilibrium. Nevertheless, groups that have been
adversely affected by the peso’s strength have scaled up complaints. Continued use of a mix
of measures, including a flexible exchange rate with intervention limited to smooth erratic
movements and build up reserves, is appropriate. Also, the recent two-step liberalization of
the financial account should help moderate net capital inflows. The government’s decision to
tilt the borrowing mix more heavily toward domestic sources is encouraging; it could reduce
vulnerabilities and potentially ease pressure on the peso.
38.
The outlook for the financial system has improved substantially. Welcome progress
has been made in disposing of non-performing assets. Following the introduction of
international accounting standards and introduction of Basel II, banks have upgraded risk

22
management facilities, raised capital, and merged. Bank monitoring has also improved,
thanks to a reorganization that has created a more streamlined and effective supervision unit
at the BSP. However, passage of the BSP Charter Amendment will be essential to lift the
threat of legal action against supervisors, facilitate the operation of monetary policy, and
improve economic surveillance of the non-bank sector.
39.
Nevertheless, much work remains if the economy is to weather a serious turn of the
credit cycle. The remaining stock of non-performing assets is large, depressing the return on
assets—one of the lowest in the region. Banks hold a large stock of government debt that is
sensitive to changes in sovereign spreads. Pending key legislation such as the Corporate
Recovery Act and the Credit Information Systems Act could help improve bank profitability
and lending through better pricing of loans and greater recovery rates from loans that sour.
40.
Ongoing power sector privatization efforts have been successful. Sales of
government assets have generated more income than expected. Greater debt prepayment and
pricing reforms have allowed the NPC to improve its financial picture. The final auction of
Transco, after repeated failures, is particularly welcome. These developments should help
support the government’s effort to ensure that growth is not impeded by power shortages.
41.

Staff recommends the next Article IV Consultation be on the standard 12-month cycle.

APPENDIX I. DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
The sustainability of the Philippines’ public sector debt depends largely on the strength
of future reforms. In the baseline scenario, recent fiscal gains are assumed to be
sustained, but no new measures are introduced over the medium term apart from the
planned reduction in the corporate income tax (CIT) rate in 2009. In this scenario, the
nonfinancial public sector (NFPS) debt will decline, but will remain high at 43 percent of
GDP in 2013. While the debt dynamics are favorable overall, they remain vulnerable to
shocks, especially to the exchange rate and, to a lesser extent, growth.
Projected external debt dynamics are generally benign. In recent years, external debt
has steadily declined—from nearly 80 percent of GDP in 2003 to just over 40 percent in
2007, with the appreciated peso and stronger growth each responsible for about half of
the change. Under the staff’s baseline scenario, the external debt ratio would fall
gradually over the medium term to just below 30 percent in 2013. Such a level of external
indebtedness compares favorably with other emerging market economies, and past
empirical work suggests that it entails limited vulnerabilities.
•

Continued vulnerability to the exchange rate: A one-time real depreciation of
30 percent is estimated to entail a 15-percentage point jump in the external debt ratio
from its 2008 level and would remain above 50 percent in the medium term.

•

Rising resilience to interest rate and growth shocks: Given the lengthening of
maturities and tilt toward domestic financing, external debt is essentially unaffected
by world interest rate and domestic growth shocks. It is only moderately affected
(ending up some 5 percentage points higher by 2013) by non-interest shocks to the
current account.

1/ Nonfinancial public sector includes the national government, CB-BOL, 14 monitored government-owned enterprises, social security institutions, and local governments. Debt is gross and consolidated (net of
intra-nonfinancial public sector holdings of debt).
2/ Revenue is the sum of all nonfinancial public sector revenue net of intra-public sector payments. It is assumed that 80 percent of Bureau of Treasury revenue represents interest and dividends from other
parts of the nonfinancial public sector.

denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
4/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
5/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as ae(1+r).
6/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.

Exchange Arrangement:

The exchange arrangement is classified as an independent float. The value of the Philippine
peso is determined in the interbank foreign exchange market; the Bangko Sentral intervenes

42
in the spot and forward markets in order to smooth undue short-term fluctuations in the
exchange rate and to strategically build reserves.
VIII.

Article IV Consultation:

The Philippines is on the standard 12-month cycle. The 2006 Article IV Consultation was
discussed by the Executive Board on January 19, 2007. At that time, Directors commended
the authorities for substantial further strengthening of macroeconomic performance in
2006—as evidenced by a rebound in growth with declining inflation; a boost to market
confidence from the positive results of fiscal reform; and a steady uptick in capital inflows
and reserves. Given this progress, Directors welcomed the early repayment by the
Philippines of its outstanding obligations to the IMF, which triggered the exit from PostProgram Monitoring (PPM) at end-2006.
IX.

FSAP and ROSC Participation:

MCM: The Philippines’ FSAP was conducted during the fourth quarter of 2001; FSAP
missions visited Manila in October and November–December 2001. The final version of the
report was discussed with the authorities in June 2002. The associated FSSA was discussed
by the Executive Board together with the Article IV staff report in September 2002.
FAD: Discussions on fiscal transparency were held in Manila in September 2001. The ROSC
report was discussed by the Executive Board in September 2002 together with the Article IV
staff report, and published in October 2002. The update to the ROSC report was published in
June 2004. FAD adviser has visited Manila six times (June and September 2006, January,
March, May, and July 2007). (Funding is available for a further three visits, if warranted by
an improvement in reform progress).
STA: ROSC Data Module mission was conducted in September 2003, and the report was
published in August 2004.
X.

Technical Assistance:

An MCM resident banking supervision advisor has been stationed in Manila since May 2003,
to assist the BSP in the implementation of a new supervisory model. An MCM mission
visited Manila in February 2005 to review the payment systems, central bank accounting,
and government bond market development. An MCM mission took place in July 2006 to
review the regulation and infrastructure of the domestic debt market. Another MCM visited
Manila in November 2006 to advise on liberalization of the foreign exchange market.
An STA peripatetic mission visited Manila in July–August 2003, January–February 2004,
and February–March 2005 to provide technical assistance in balance of payments and
international investment position statistics and in implementing the recommendations made

43
by the ROSC Data Module mission. An STA mission took place in March-April 2006 to
assist the authorities in compiling and disseminating government finance statistics in
accordance with GFSM 2001.
An FAD mission to provide a briefing to the new tax commissioner took place in April–
May 2001. An FAD mission reviewed VAT and excise administration in December 2001. An
FAD staff member participated in the July 2004 PPM mission to evaluate and advice on tax
measures. An FAD mission visited Manila in November-December 2005 to provide
assistance in the areas of tax and customs administration and another mission was fielded in
March 2006 to reach agreement with the authorities on the priorities of the BIR reform
agenda. An FAD tax administration advisor visited Manila in June-July 2006, the first in a
program of 8 or 9 visits to help the Tax Reform Administration Group to implement the
reform agenda.
An LEG legal expert visited Manila to discuss anti-money laundering initiatives in
March 2002.
XI.

Resident Representative:

A Resident Representative has been stationed in Manila since January 1984. Mr. Reza Baqir
assumed the post of Resident Representative in July 2005.
XII.

Fourth Amendment to the Articles of Agreement:

The authorities have formally communicated to the Fund their acceptance of the Fourth
Amendment, which was ratified by the Upper House of Parliament (Senate) in August 2001.

44
II. PHILIPPINES: STATISTICAL ISSUES
While data provision for surveillance purposes is adequate overall, shortcomings
remain in certain areas. The Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC)—
Data Module, a Response by the Authorities, and a Detailed Assessment Using the Data
Quality Assessment Framework (DQAF) were published on the IMF website in
August 2004. The ROSC identified the national accounts and balance of payments statistics
as needing particular attention.
The country subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination Standards (SDDS) in August 1996
and its metadata are posted on the Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB).
A. National Accounts
Despite the authorities’ efforts to improve quality, weaknesses remain in the national
accounts. These include large discrepancies in GDP estimates between the expenditure and
production sides (the official GDP estimates), with consequent differences in estimates of
GDP growth.
The data ROSC identified a number of causes for these problems.4
•

Deaths and births of establishments are not adequately captured. This gap is of
growing importance given the rapid structural change in the economy in recent years,
with a large number of new establishments, in particular in the electronics and
information technology industries.

•

Compilation relies on an outdated benchmark year and fixed input-output ratios.
Estimates are derived by extrapolation of the 1988 benchmark year using fixed inputoutput ratios. For example, GDP statistics for the electronic sector suggest that value
added remained at 10 percent of exports over the past years in spite of industry evidence
that the domestic component of exports has been rising sharply.5

•

Statistical techniques in estimating GDP at constant prices are inadequate. For most
activities, not all components of the production accounts are compiled, instead only value
added is estimated. Value added at current prices is calculated by extrapolating the
benchmark year value with an indicator for the value of output; data in constant prices
are estimated using a price deflator for output. In addition, the national accounts constant
price estimates for merchandise exports and imports are constructed by multiplying 1985

4
5

Currently, the authorities are compiling new national accounts series based on the 1993 SNA guidelines.

Industry representatives indicate that the domestic component has increased significantly, to around 30 percent
in recent years.

45
values by quantity data (weights) from the foreign trade statistics for current years.
Because of this inappropriate method, implicit deflators for electric machinery products
appear high compared with developments in world market prices.
The consumer price index (CPI) has been compiled since February 2004 using weights based
on the 2000 Family Income and Expenditures (FIES) survey. A notable change was that the
weight given to the group comprising food, beverages, and tobacco (FBT) decreased to
50 percent in 2000 from 55 percent in 1994, the previous weight reference year.
B. Balance of Payments
Steps have been taken to improve the quality of the balance of payments. The Fund has
fielded several technical assistance missions since 1995, including the assignment of a
peripatetic advisor in 2003. In 2005, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) created a new
Department of Economic Statistics, with one of its units to concentrate on compiling,
analyzing, and publishing the balance of payments and the international investment position.
Progress since 2004, has included a significant improvement in the measurement of imports
to correct an underestimation of imports of electronic goods on a consignment basis,
improvements in the classification and recording of remittances, the introduction of a new
methodology for measuring trade credits, and progress in the direct investment survey. Major
revisions to the 2003-04 accounts were made in March 2005 and work to backtrack the series
to 1999 was completed in the first quarter of 2006. Data for external debt and reserves are
generally of good quality, although the data ROSC mission identified scope for
improvement.
The revisions to imports have narrowed the gap between national trade data and those
of partner countries on a net basis. An interagency task force on import statistics was
established in July 2002 to improve the measurement of activity in the electronics sector,
which accounts for about 43 percent of trade flows. Results of surveys covering electronics
sector raw material imports confirmed that imports were routinely underestimated in reports
to the National Statistics Office. Import figures have therefore been revised substantially,
back to 2000.6 As a result, the estimated trade balance for 2001 changed from a surplus of
3.8 percent of GDP to a deficit of 8.8 percent of GDP. A comparison of the revised figures
with trade data of partner countries suggests that the revised trade balances for 2001–02 are
reasonably well measured. However, substantial differences remain with partner country data
on gross flows of exports and imports, with the latter about 15 percent higher than the
corresponding national data. The BSP is continuing research on the factors behind
discrepancies in data related to trade in processed goods, such as electronics and textiles.

6

Data from 1996–99 have not been revised and remain underestimated.

46
Challenges remain for addressing certain compilation issues. Since deregulation in the
early 1990s, international transactions have increasingly flowed through nontraditional
channels that are not adequately covered by the statistical reporting system. The Foreign
Currency Deposit Units (FCDUs), which account for about 70–75 percent of foreign
exchange settlements, are exempt from reporting requirements because of strict secrecy
banking rules. Steps have been taken to measure cross-border transactions that skirt the
domestic banking system, such as flows through inter-company accounts.7 Enterprise
surveys, for example, have been introduced, although these are conducted on a voluntary
basis and will take time to implement fully. Unless modifications are made to secrecy rules
associated with FCDU accounts to facilitate the collection of data for statistical purposes,
compilers of the balance of payments will continue to face challenges in securing adequate
source data.
C. Monetary Accounts
Compilation of monetary and financial statistics (MFS) largely conforms to the Fund’s
methodology, although there is some scope for improvement. The authorities have
recently made progress in implementing some of the recommendations of the data ROSC.
They have introduced the Depository Corporations Survey, which now includes operations of
thrift and rural banks. They have also introduced uniform procedures for converting foreign
currency denominated accounts to local currency in the monetary aggregates. However, some
weaknesses remain, including in the treatment of non-operational banks, valuation of
securities, and treatment of accrued interest. The October 2007 MFS mission introduced the
standardized report forms (SRFs) for reporting monetary statistics to the IMF and an
integrated monetary database (IMD) that will meet the data needs of the BSP, APD, and
STA. The IMD will become operational when the BSP submits data in the SRFs in early
2008.
D. Fiscal Data
While the Philippines meets the requirements of fiscal transparency in many important
respects, the fiscal and data ROSCs found areas that require strengthening. An
important problem is that the budget is presented on an obligations basis, while the deficit is
reported on a cash basis, complicating comparisons of budgets and outcomes. In addition, for
levels of the public sector beyond the budgetary central (national) government, consolidated
fiscal outturns for items other than the fiscal balance are generally unavailable. The
August 2004 GFS mission addressed shortcomings in the reconciliation of debt stocks and
financing flows and advised on improving the consolidation of debt data for the public sector
7

According to recent household surveys, typically about 30 percent of remittances of Overseas Filipino
Workers were not channeled through the banking system, suggesting that remittances may have been
underestimated by about US$3 billion (3.8 percent of GDP) in 2002.

47
(and its subsectors). This has allowed publication of revised nonfinancial public sector debt
data since early 2005. The discrepancy between stocks and flows was further investigated
during a follow-up mission in April 2006. It was established that the problems with
reconciliation result from differences in time of recording and inconsistency in the coverage
and classification of some transactions related to debt guarantees and assumed debt. The
authorities agreed to compare the coverage of data in the two debt recording systems,
standardize the classifications of these transactions, and improve the recording of debt
transactions according to international best practice.
The introduction of a standardized chart of accounts, and the electronic New
Government Accounting System has facilitated the compilation of annual financial
statements for all the levels of the public sector. The accounting system allows for the
compilation of accrual based accounts and also provides for the compilation of a statement of
cash flows. These statements become available six months after the end of a reference
period. In addition, the mission worked with the authorities to revise classifications in the
chart of accounts, in order to allow for the consolidation of data for the nonfinancial public
sector as a whole. Also, it recommended separating the market and non-market activities of
the government-owned-and-controlled-corporations, so that consolidated data for the general
government sector could be compiled.
Annual data covering only the budgetary central government are reported for
publication in the GFSY, and monthly budgetary central government data are
published in the IFS. A dedicated unit in Department of Finance was created to compile
government finance statistics in accordance with GFSM 2001 framework.

III. RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
A. World Bank Lending and Nonlending Activities
Since the World Bank started operations in the Philippines, it has committed approximately
$12 billion under IBRD loans and $239 million under IDA credits (less cancellations).
As of September 30, 2007, the Philippines portfolio consisted of 22 projects, amounting to
$1.13 billion with an undisbursed balance of $854.0 million. As a result of the improved
fiscal situation and demand from the government, lending rose from around $100 million to
$200 million a year from FY03 to FY05, to $410 million in FY06 and $395 million in FY07.
The figure in FY07 includes a first Development Policy Loan ($250 million), after an 8-year
lull in policy based lending and three investment operations. Three investment operations
were approved in FY06 and another three are scheduled for Board deliberations before the
end of FY08. Based on net commitments and by sector, the current portfolio can be broken
down as follows: infrastructure ($334 million, 30 percent); human development
($326 million, 29 percent); rural development and environment ($338 million, 30 percent);
social development ($100 million, 9 percent); and governance and economic management
($32.9 million, 3 percent).
The overarching objective of the Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for the
Philippines is to improve the lives of Filipinos through sustainable economic growth and
greater social inclusion. Fiscal stability and public institutions that serve the common good
are critical to these objectives. The strategy supports “Islands of Good Governance” in those
government agencies, local governments, and dynamic sectors in the Philippines that
demonstrate how improved accountability and service delivery will lead to better economic
and social outcomes. The CAS seeks to align Bank lending more closely with the
government’s own investment priorities, within the existing national budget, implying a shift
away from financing discrete projects toward programmatic engagement. The approach also
encourages local government units to pursue and finance their own priorities and to foster a
better partnership with the national government.
The CAS originally set forth a conservative lending program of up to $1.8 billion for the
entire FY06–08 period. As a result of the increased fiscal space, the pressing need for
increased public investment to stimulate growth, especially in infrastructure, and strong
demand from the government, the CAS period has been extended by one year to June 2009
and the envisaged lending envelope for the remaining two years of the CAS scaled up to
between $0.8 billion to $2.2 billion. The actual lending level will continue to be tied to fiscal
performance, while the composition of new investments will be determined by reform
intensity in different policy areas. Only operations with adequate governance and anti
corruption safeguards will be considered under the program.

50
An important aspect of World Bank support to the Philippines is in the form of analytical and
advisory activities leveraged through partnerships with other organizations, administration of
trust funds, policy dialogue and involvement in the Philippines Development Forum working
groups. Strategic partnerships, supported by large bilateral and multi donor trust funds
administered by the World Bank, are beginning to form a growing line of business in the
Philippines, as the Government and its development partners move toward coordinated sector
wide approaches in delivering development assistance to various sectors, in line with the
Paris Declaration.
Significant analytical effort is currently being focused around the theme of achieving shared
growth, in addition to the six thematic programs of fiscal reform; growth and the investment
climate; social development and inclusion, social protection, and poverty; governance,
political economy reform, and anti-corruption; local government, municipal finance, and
fiscal decentralization; and meeting infrastructure needs. Four major pieces of analytical
were delivered in FY07, including an Agricultural Public Expenditure Review, an
Environment Monitor focused on Environmental Health, a report on the Investment Climate,
and a Development Policy Review for the Philippines Development Forum.
The Bank has an extensive outreach program in the Philippines to promote knowledge
sharing. Currently there are ten Knowledge for Development Centers (KDCs) around the
country that make available Bank publications and development literature either through online access or through hard copies. The Bank has also partnered with the Asian Institute of
Management (AIM) to create a Global Distance Learning Network that offers distance
learning sessions for a broad national, regional, and international audience. In addition, the
Bank also maintains an external country website (www.worldbank.org.ph).
B. Partnership
The Philippines Development Forum (PDF), formerly called the Consultative Group (CG), is
the primary mechanism of the Government for facilitating substantive policy dialogue among
stakeholders on the country’s development agenda. The main event is held in country every
twelve months, and the next PDF is scheduled to convene in March 2008. As in the past
three years, the Bank will co-chair the meeting with the Philippine Government, represented
by the Department of Finance. The PDF has seven working groups in the following areas to
facilitate the policy dialogue throughout the year related to their specific themes: MDGs and
social progress; growth and investment climate; economic and fiscal reforms; governance
and anti-corruption; Mindanao, sustainable rural development; and decentralization and local
government.

IV. RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
Reflecting the improved public budget situation and progress with sector reforms, in 2006
ADB approved new loans for $650 million, the highest since 1998, and disbursed
$750 million, the highest ever, while the net resource transfer was positive ($269 million) for
the first time since 1997. In 2007, ADB expects to approve new commitments of about the
same amount, with increasing opportunities for investment project lending and more private
sector operations. Financial support is augmented by non-lending activities, which
significantly enhance the impact of the ADB-Philippines partnership
Since joining the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in 1966, the Philippines has
received 199 loans for a total of $9.53 billion, and 322 technical assistance grants amounting
to $147 million. Energy and agriculture account for the largest proportion of lending
(Table 1). Since 1998, 72% of lending has been for policy-based operations and 28 percent
for investment projects.
AsDB’s private sector operations, which are made without government guarantee, amounted
to $429.7 million, including 16 loans of $275.3 million and 20 equity investments of
$36.8 million. The Philippines is one of the largest clients for such activities.

The ADB Philippines Country Strategy and Program 2005–2007 (CSP) provides the
framework for the alignment of ADB’s activities with Philippine priorities. ADB’s
engagement focuses on support for fiscal consolidation, improving the investment climate,
and faster achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. A recent assessment
concluded that the CSP strategic framework remains relevant and robust, allowing it to be

53
extended by one year to end 2008. Under the extended CSP, ADB expects to continue to
provide most of its financial support using the policy-based lending modality, calibrating its
high case lending scenario against progress on fiscal consolidation and sector reforms. ADB
works with the IMF and other development partners, in collaboration with Government, to
build a common understanding of economic issues and prospects, and to determine the best
timing for policy-based support.
Fiscal and macroeconomic stability. In 2007 ADB supported the Government’s broad
policy reform agenda with the Development Policy Support Program loan ($250 million).
ADB expects to provide a series of such loans over the medium term, supporting fiscal
consolidation, governance and anti-corruption, the investment climate, and social sector
service delivery.
Power Sector. In recent years support has been provided to restructure the sector and reduce
its drain on the national budget. The policy-based Power Sector Development Program loan
($450 million), approved in December 2006, provides the anchor for many of AsDB’s
activities. Further financial support is being contemplated to facilitate privatization and more
effective competition at the wholesale and retail levels.
Local Government. ADB supports a wide range of activities at the sub-national government
level to improve governance, own-resource mobilization, planning and budgeting, and
service delivery. In 2007 ADB plans a policy-based loan for the Local Government
Financing and Budget Reform Program ($300 million).
Other sectors. ADB is engaged in policy dialogue, lending and technical assistance for
justice reform, urban services for the poor, agrarian reform, coastal resources, upland
agriculture, and supporting government’s customizing the Paris Declaration on Aid
Effectiveness for Philippine circumstances. The Philippines participates in ADB’s regional
economic cooperation and integration initiatives.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2007 Article IV Consultation
with the Philippines
On March 12, 2008, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with the Philippines.1
Background
Economic performance has improved markedly over the past few years. Founded on
impressive fiscal consolidation, investor confidence has revived, and sovereign spreads have
tightened. A substantial improvement in banking supervision has gone in hand with a marked
improvement in banks’ balance sheets.
GDP growth accelerated to 7.3 percent (annual average) in 2007 in a low inflation
environment. Private consumption firmed as remittances remained strong, part of which
financed home purchases. Fiscal impetus from government spending, including on
infrastructure, provided an added push to growth. Private investment remained low by regional
standards, but there are tentative signs of a revival. Headline inflation was only 2.8 percent
(annual average) in 2007, primarily from higher food and oil prices.
These developments and favorable global conditions led to a surge in foreign exchange
inflows and the external value of the peso. The current account surplus reached 5.7 percent of
GDP in the first half of 2007 on high levels of transfers from overseas workers. Heightened
investor interest in Philippine securities helped to turn the financial account into a small
surplus. Intervention helped smooth fluctuations in the foreign exchange market and scale up
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return
to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive
Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board,
summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's
authorities.

buffers for increased capital flows. Despite a large buildup of reserves, the currency
appreciated 19 percent against the U.S. dollar during 2007.
The momentum in stepped-up collection from the 2006 VAT reform slowed. The government
deficit (excluding privatization receipts) widened to about 1½ percent of GDP as expected
improvements in tax administration did not materialize. Yet there was a welcomed pickup in
public investment. While the deficit is likely to be mitigated by privatization receipts, the debtto-revenue ratio remained high relative to other countries. Privatization has attracted large
interest from investors. Around 40 percent of power generating capacity has been sold to date.
Inflation remained low because of an appreciating peso and prudent monetary policy. The
Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) successfully sterilized the jump in liquidity from foreign
exchange intervention, including through broader access to the Special Deposit Account
facility. At the same time, the benign inflation outlook permitted the BSP to cut interest rates in
the second half of 2007 and in the process moderate inflows and support growth. Outflows
were also encouraged through prepayment of external debt and foreign exchange
liberalization.
The health of the financial sector has improved substantially. Non-performing assets of banks
were reduced without government support; risk management facilities were upgraded as
Basel II was phased in. Corporations also found alternative sources of funding, as equity and
bond placements helped to supplement bank lending in 2007.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for the economy’s impressive performance—
strong growth, low inflation, sustained fiscal consolidation, and improved investor confidence.
Directors also welcomed the improvement in the health of the banking system and the
strengthening of bank supervision. Against this background, they encouraged the authorities to
address the remaining challenges and vulnerabilities, including infrastructure bottlenecks,
social needs, and further strengthening of the financial sector, which would help the
Philippines weather the ongoing global financial turmoil.
Directors praised the authorities for their strong efforts in fiscal adjustment. They welcomed the
2005 and 2006 tax reforms, and commended the authorities’ efforts to control spending. Better
performance of non-financial public enterprises has slashed the public sector deficit and
further improved the Philippines’ debt dynamics. Directors viewed the government’s plan to
attain a balanced budget in 2008 within a firm medium-term framework as an important
demonstration of fiscal prudence.
Directors encouraged the authorities to strengthen the tax effort and place priority spending on
a sustainable footing. In addition to administrative reforms, they considered that legislation is
needed to restore the tax base by rationalizing fiscal incentives and adjusting excise taxes.
Directors noted that Public-Private Partnerships can be useful but require close monitoring,
particularly of projects that extend guarantees to private investors. They also congratulated the
authorities for a sustained effort at privatizing power sector assets, which has generated more
income than expected and helped to support the government’s plan to ensure that growth is
not impeded by power shortages.

3
Directors commended the authorities for managing foreign exchange inflows well, while
maintaining price stability. They highlighted, in particular, the successful smoothing of peso
fluctuations while taking a strategic opportunity to build reserves. Directors noted that wider
access to the Special Deposit Account, together with operations through the Reverse
Repurchase facility and greater use of swaps, have successfully sterilized the reserves buildup
and reduced liquidity growth. Well-anchored inflation expectations and an appreciating peso
have helped counter the effects of sharply higher commodity prices in 2007. Directors were
reassured by the authorities’ commitment to remain vigilant, given the recent increase in
inflation provoked by higher global food and oil prices.
Noting that the underlying current account balance is only slightly higher than its long-run
average, Directors considered the exchange rate to be broadly in equilibrium. They
recommended continuation of the current policy of limiting intervention to smooth erratic
movements of the currency in the context of the flexible exchange rate regime. They also
welcomed the recent two-step liberalization of the foreign exchange regulatory regime, which
should help moderate net capital inflows. The government’s decision to tilt its borrowing mix
more heavily toward domestic sources should further reduce vulnerabilities and potentially
ease pressure on the peso.
Directors welcomed the improvement in the health of the financial system. They also
encouraged the authorities to further strengthen the financial sector, particularly in light of slow
domestic credit growth and the possible effects of a serious turn in the credit cycle. While
welcoming the progress in disposing of non-performing assets and in implementing
international accounting standards and Basel II, Directors pointed to the need to reduce the
remaining large stock of non-performing assets. They also noted that banks hold a significant
amount of government debt that is sensitive to changes in sovereign spreads. Directors
acknowledged that bank monitoring had improved, but encouraged the authorities to work for
the passage of the BSP Charter Amendment, which is essential to lift the threat of legal action
against supervisors, facilitate the operation of monetary policy, and improve economic
surveillance of the non-bank sector. Directors also called for the adoption of legislation such as
the Corporate Recovery Act and the Credit Information Systems Act, to help improve bank
profitability and lending.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by Richard Murray, Executive Director for the Philippines
and Wilhelmina Mañalac, Alternate Executive Director
March 12, 2008
Key Points
●

Continued implementation of prudent macroeconomic policies and structural reforms
bolstered confidence in the economy and paved the way for milestone achievements,
notwithstanding the external and internal shocks experienced during the year. The
Philippine economy grew by 7.3 percent in 2007, the highest in more than three
decades. Inflation averaged 2.8 percent, its lowest in 21 years. The budget deficit was
reduced to 0.1 percent of GDP, the lowest in 10 years. Foreign exchange reserves
stood at an unprecedented level of $33.8 billion, with the exchange rate recovering
from previous bouts of undervaluation. The Philippine Stock Exchange Index (PSEI)
reached an all-time high of 3873.5 index points in October 2007.

●

Faced with the near-term challenges brought about by the recent volatility in financial
markets and the slowdown in the US economy, coupled with the long-term objective
of achieving sustained macroeconomic stability, the authorities are determined to
implement additional necessary reforms, particularly in the fiscal and financial
sectors. The government will pursue its priority to enhance governance practices to
further improve the business environment.

Introduction
1.

The Philippine authorities welcome the productive exchange of views with the Fund
staff and their candid assessment of the key developments in the economy and the
policy responses by the authorities in the year just passed, as well as discussions on
future challenges. The authorities also thank the staff for the papers on selected issues,
which support proposed policy measures particularly in the fiscal sector, and provide
inputs for future decisions. The authorities also value staff advice, which benefited
from staff’s knowledge on a wide range of cross-country experiences.

The Philippine economy takes a significant leap forward
2.

The economy grew by 7.3 percent in 2007, the highest in 31 years. Growth was broadbased, led by the fast expanding services sector. Inflation was on a downtrend while
the fiscal deficit was significantly lower than program level. The external payments
position considerably improved due to substantial inflows of foreign exchange (FX)
from exports, remittances and foreign investments, while the exchange rate recovered
from previous undervaluation. The authorities took advantage of the favorable
conditions to build up reserves and further improve the debt structure. With the rise in

2
the level of investor confidence, the stock market maintained its bullishness and the
PSEI reached its highest level since 1997.
3.

The country’s milestone achievements demonstrate the authorities’ commitment to
implement sound macroeconomic policies and to pursue additional reforms, in the face
of record high global oil and non-oil commodity prices and the recent domestic political
incidents. Going forward, the authorities are well aware of the remaining challenges
they continue to face. While the current global financial turmoil stemming from the
subprime mortgage crisis in the US has had little impact on the Philippine financial
system which has remained stable, the resulting slowdown in economic activity in the
US (a major trading partner of the Philippines) and the rest of the world may dampen
export growth and remittances by overseas Filipinos (OF). The continued high and
volatile prices of global oil and non-oil commodities, including food, might put some
pressure on domestic inflation. The authorities continue to monitor developments in
these and other areas even as they pursue further reforms to sustain the gains achieved
so far.

Sustaining the gains require continued implementation of prudent monetary and
external sector policies
4.

Inflation at 2.8 percent was well below the target range for 2007 and the lowest annual
average in 21 years. From the supply side, low inflation was maintained as a result of
favorable agricultural production, the firm peso, and the subsiding base effects of the
reformed value added tax (RVAT) implemented in November 2005 and February 2006.
However, headline inflation increased in the last two months of 2007 with pressures
coming from global supply shocks mainly coming from oil and non-oil commodities,
particularly food, and strengthening demand conditions. Headline inflation is expected
to be within target of 4 ± 1 percentage point in 2008.

5.

Earlier in 2007, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) implemented liquidity
management measures to help prevent potential inflationary pressures that could build
up over the medium term as a result of rapid money supply growth driven mainly by
FX inflows. The widening of the access to its Special Deposit Account (SDA) facility
which now included trust offices of financial institutions supervised by the BSP, helped
sterilize liquidity resulting from strong FX inflows and reduced liquidity growth from a
peak of 26.1 percent year-on-year in April 2007 to 9.0 percent in December of the same
year, the slowest pace in nearly two years. Since the implementation of the twin
monetary policy moves which lifted the tiering scheme and adjusted the policy rates in
July 2007, the BSP considered the benign inflation outlook as well as the favorable
balance of risks and reduced its key policy rates by 25 basis points four times for a total
of 100 basis points. The latest reduction was implemented in January 2008. However,
with the rise in headline inflation to 4.9 percent in January 2008 and 5.4 percent in
February as a result of elevated prices of food items, fuel, transportation and

3
communication services, the BSP will continue to be attentive to inflationary risks with
a view to calibrating its monetary policy stance that would maintain price stability as
the economy sustains its strong growth momentum.
6.

Enabled by a favorable external environment, the country’s gross international reserves
reached a historic level of $33.8 billion at end-December 2007, overshooting the 2007
target, in the face of sustained inflows of remittances, foreign portfolio and direct
investments, and export earnings. Foreign exchange reserves further rose to $34.8
billion in January 2008 due mainly to inflows from the BSP’s net FX operations on the
back of sustained FX inflows as well as income from the BSP’s investments abroad. A
modest expansion in exports occurred in spite of the peso appreciation recorded at 18.8
percent for the year. Assessed against international benchmarks, the reserves level at
end-December 2007 could adequately cover 5.9 months of imports of goods and
payments of services and income and is equivalent to 4.9 times the country’s short-term
external debt based on original maturity and 3.0 times based on residual maturity.

7.

Staff’s assessment that the Philippines’ exchange rate is in line with fundamentals is
welcome. Consistent with the country’s market-determined exchange rate policy, the
authorities have allowed the peso to be market-determined while smoothing observed
volatilities and seizing the opportunity to increase reserves as a precautionary measure
in case any possible reversal of market sentiment occurs. Amidst calls from the export
and services sectors for more actions from the BSP to moderate the peso appreciation,
the BSP continues to adhere to a market-determined exchange rate.

8.

At the same time, the BSP has promoted the use of hedging products offered by banks
to reduce FX risk for dollar earners. A hedging program for exporters was offered by
the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) which provides options for exporters
to hedge themselves against potential FX rate losses through FX insurance and forward
FX rate protection products. Other commercial banks have initiated public information
campaigns to popularize the use of hedging facilities.

9.

As with other Asian countries, the authorities had to face the difficult task of managing
the substantial flows of FX, considering the associated rise in liquidity and the
appreciation of the exchange rate. In response to this challenge, the authorities took the
opportunity to prepay some of its external debt, including obligations to the Fund,
resulting in the improvement of the country’s debt structure. In 2007, the country
prepaid $2.8 billion of the medium and long term external debt of both the public and
private sectors. Two phases of FX liberalization measures were also implemented
which allow the freer flow of FX both in the current and capital accounts. The BSP will
continue its review of the FX regulatory framework to further relax existing rules
particularly on registration requirements and offshore investments. The idea is to make
the market supportive of a more dynamic, expanding and increasingly globally
integrated economy. On the fiscal side, the authorities will source their financing

4
requirements largely from domestic sources to lessen the impact of the strengthening of
the currency as well as reduce the public sector’s vulnerability to exchange rate
movements.
Fiscal consolidation and sustainability depend on continued fiscal reforms
10.

Consistent with its goal of achieving a balanced budget by 2008, the National
Government (NG) deficit was recorded at 0.1 percent of GDP in 2007 (see Table 1).
This outcome was as a result of increased revenues, savings in interest payments due to
lower interest rates, and prepayment of debt. Prompted by the progress in stabilizing
public sector finances and an easing in government’s dependence on external financing,
Moody’s Investor Service upgraded its outlook of the country’s capacity to pay its
obligations to “positive” from “stable.” Meanwhile, the consolidated public sector
financial position recorded a surplus of P52.8 billion as of end-September 2007, almost
six times the P8.9 billion surplus for the same period in 2006. This was largely due to
the substantial improvement in the performance of government-owned and controlled
corporations (GOCCs), in particular, the power sector.

11.

The government’s successful privatization program which attracted strong investor
interest primarily contributed to the rise in revenue. Tax revenues, while recording an
increase, fell below the target as interest rates declined and the peso appreciated
affecting export and import transactions. Tax revenues increased by 13 percent on an
annual basis, as improvements in the management revenue collection office, helped
increase tax revenues during the second half of 2007. The authorities expect the
ongoing tax administration reforms to start reaping dividends this year. Meanwhile, the
tax effort slightly declined to 14 percent against last year’s 14.3 percent. The
government’s goal is to return to an upward trajectory and achieve a 16 percent tax
effort by 2010 or close to pre-crisis (1996) levels of 16.9 percent.

12.

With the majority of the high-ticketed assets privatized in 2007, the government is
keenly aware of the need to achieve a sustained tax revenue base in order to meet its
goal of a balanced budget this year. In addition to further enhancing tax administration,
among the authorities’ priorities are streamlining fiscal incentives, particularly phasing
out the income tax holiday, and simplifying the system of excise taxes on tobacco
products specifically the proposed application of a uniform tax rate, by product, on sin
taxes. In particular, the National Government proposes to phase out the income tax
holiday within three years from the effectivity of the proposed regulation. In lieu of the
income tax holiday, eligible enterprises will be given a choice of either a reduced
income tax rate (partial income tax holiday) or a gross income tax package. The
proposed tax incentive package is to run for 20 years. Meanwhile, the proposed
simplification of the excise tax system on tobacco entails the reduction in the number of
tax brackets being applied to both tobacco and alcohol products. Specific provisions
will be introduced to simplify excise tax administration. In addition, a number of

5
governance measures in the government’s agenda are to be intensified including the
Revenue Protection Integrity Service (RIPS) where 82 cases have been filed to date,
Run After Tax Evaders (RATE) and Run After the Smugglers (RATS) with 87 and 60
cases filed, respectively.
13.

In last year’s meeting, Directors expressed concern that expenditure compression as a
means to fiscal consolidation is not sustainable. In full agreement with this statement,
the expenditure compression which was observed in previous years was reversed in
2007 as the authorities implemented various projects aimed at improving infrastructure
and social spending. This year’s budget, which is up by 8 percent from 2007, places
strong emphasis on upgrading the country’s infrastructure facilities. In response to the
slowdown in the US, the authorities intend to frontload expenditures particularly for
infrastructure. The measure is viewed as appropriately addressing the twin objectives
of alleviating the impact of the global situation and the government’s goal of reducing
its deficit.

14.

Meanwhile, the National Government debt as percent to GDP dropped to 59.4 percent
in 2007 from 66.9 percent in 2006. It is expected to go down further to 54 percent in
2008 as a result of lower interest cost, which, together with the peso appreciation also
helped reduce the National Government’s financing requirement.

Sustained economic growth will be facilitated by further implementation of the
structural reform agenda
15.

While the financial sector has shown considerable improvement, the BSP is well aware
of the remaining vulnerabilities faced by the sector. The BSP’s medium-term strategic
plan thus establishes a four-pronged approach towards developing a stronger and more
efficient banking system that is prepared to meet the needs of the country’s mediumterm economic development program. In particular, the approach entails further
enhancing the existing regulatory framework, promoting corporate governance, fully
implementing a consolidated and risk-based supervision approach consistent with
modern banking and finance standards, and advancing capital market reform initiatives.
A notable achievement in July 2007 was the full implementation of Basel II for the
standardized approach. The advanced internal ratings based approach is targeted for
full implementation after 2010. The BSP also sustains its advocacy efforts for the
passage of vital legislation that affect the BSP and the financial system, such as the
amendments to the Central Bank Act that would strengthen its supervisory and
regulatory powers, help develop the capital market, allow the monetary policy stance
under the inflation targeting framework to determine the limits on the growth of
monetary and price indicators, remove the restrictions on the BSP’s issuance of its own
securities, and expand its authority to obtain data from the non-bank sector.

6
16.

On the power sector, the Wholesale Electricity Spot Market (WESM) has started to
bring down power cost. In January 2008, the WESM rate was at an all-time low of
P3.38/kwh since the spot market started in July 2006.

17.

The Power Sector Assets and Liabilities Management Corporation or PSALM
advanced the privatization efforts of government in the power sector when it sold at
least 10 plants equivalent to 42 percent of the generating assets of the National Power
Corporation in 2007. This year, PSALM has lined up the sale of 10 more plants to
reach 70 percent of its privatization target, the trigger level for the open access system
to be implemented. Open access will allow power users to choose their power
suppliers. A pending bill in Congress seeks to lower the trigger level to 50 percent, to
speed up the implementation of the open access system for all residential and industrial
users in the country. Meanwhile, efforts are underway towards the reduction of power
rates in ecozones to make electricity rates more competitive.

Concluding Remarks
18.

After a long series of critical setbacks, the Philippine economy has finally taken off. To
maintain this upward course, the authorities are keenly aware of the need for further
reform efforts and continued policy discipline. Mindful of the headwinds ahead, in
conjunction with a less friendly external environment, the authorities are determined
and committed to carry out the needed measures to steer the economy towards a higher
growth path. In doing so, the authorities intend to continue working closely with the
Fund through the regular Article IV consultations and through its technical assistance
programs.
