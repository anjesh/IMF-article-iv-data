INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
CAMBODIA
Staff Report for the 2010 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2010 Consultation with Cambodia
Approved by Masahiko Takeda and Dominique Desruelle
October 15, 2010
Context: After a sharp slowdown in 2009, the economy shows signs of a recovery. However,
the global crisis exposed Cambodia’s longstanding structural vulnerabilities. Chief among
them are limited room for fiscal policy maneuver and effectiveness, a nascent and highly
dollarized financial system, a narrow export base, and a lagging rural sector.
Policy discussions: There was broad agreement that enhancing revenue administration and
stepping up public financial management reform are essential to ensure fiscal sustainability
while providing room for meeting medium-term development objectives. While achieving
greater monetary independence will be a gradual process, in the near term, staff advised to
closely monitor the current liquidity overhang and implement high-priority FSAP
recommendations. The authorities are taking steps in both areas. Staff welcomed efforts to
further improve the business environment and promote rural development as they could go a
long way in broadening Cambodia’s sources of growth and reduce poverty.
Meetings: Held in Phnom Penh August 30–September 10 with Deputy Prime Minister and
Minister of Economy and Finance Keat Chhon, Deputy Prime Minister and
Minister-in-Charge of the Office of the Council of Ministers Sok An, National Bank of
Cambodia Governor Chea Chanto, Senior Minister of Commerce Cham Prasidh, and other
ministers and senior officials, as well as donor and private sector representatives. The staff
team comprised Mr. Unteroberdoerster (Head), Ms. Duma, Mr. Ree (all APD), Ms. Kim
(SPR), and Ms. Ong (MCM, FSAP mission chief). Mr. Chea (World Bank) worked with the
team on the debt sustainability analysis, in collaboration with Mr. Liu (Asian Development
Bank). Ms. Vongpradhip and Mr. Phan (OED) participated in the discussions.
Exchange arrangement: The exchange regime is classified as stabilized arrangement.
Statistical issues: Some progress has been made in improving economic statistics, but
weaknesses remain, in particular in the compilation of the balance of payments, external debt
and disbursements, and national income accounts. Core economic data are adequate for
surveillance purposes, but the delay in releasing 2009 GDP statistics is a setback.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Prior to the global crisis, Cambodia enjoyed a decade of high growth and
relative stability. Real GDP growth averaged over 9 percent during 2000–07, the highest of
any low-income country in Asia (and one of the best performances worldwide), enabling
significant improvements in living standards and poverty reduction. Prudent fiscal policies
underpinned macroeconomic stability with headline inflation well below Cambodia’s peers
(Figure 1). Past surveillance has been characterized by broad agreement on the direction of
policies, in particular with regard to enhancing fiscal policy credibility and financial system
soundness, although progress has been slow in some critical areas such as public financial
management reform. In support of government efforts, the IMF has provided significant
technical assistance in fiscal, money and banking, and statistical areas.
2.
However, as a result of the global crisis output collapsed, exposing longstanding
structural vulnerabilities. Preliminary estimates suggest that growth fell some
10 percentage points below its pre-crisis average in 2009. Cambodia was hit harder than
comparator countries by the global recession, given vulnerabilities that are in part a legacy of
a generation lost by civil strife. Fiscal revenues, that remain low regionally, limit the scope to
fully address development priority needs, while a shallow and highly dollarized financial
system undercuts broad-based growth and complicates macroeconomic management. Growth
and exports have remained narrow-based, offering limited benefits to the rural poor,
Cambodia’s vast majority. As a result, there are indications that poverty increased after
several years of steady declines,1 setting back the momentum toward achieving the
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).
3.
The authorities’ response to the crisis helped limit the hemorrhage and is
supporting the recovery:


In an effort to provide stimulus, the government raised wages and accelerated
development spending, allowing the overall fiscal deficit to increase to over 8 percent
of GDP in 2009, up by more than 5 percentage points over 2008. While the deficit was
mostly financed by concessional loans and grants, there was also significant recourse to
domestic financing (nearly 2 percent of GDP) for the first time since 2003.



In addition, the National Bank of Cambodia (NBC) took an accommodative stance by
reducing reserve requirements (from 16 to 12 percent) and introducing an overdraft
facility. However, as a result of banking system weaknesses, the main effect was to
offer a cushion against a liquidity shock in addition to banks’ own efforts, including
by raising deposit rates, that contributed to a significant rise in liquidity in the
banking system.

1

World Bank estimates suggest that about 20 percent of households were directly exposed to the crisis through
formal employment in the hardest hit sectors (garment, construction, and tourism).

II. OUTLOOK AND RISKS: EMERGING FROM THE GLOBAL RECESSION
4.
A broadening export-led recovery has been taking hold in 2010 (Figure 2,
Table 1):


Growth: Since the beginning of this year, signs of a recovery have emerged. Garment
exports and tourist arrivals, notably by air, are bouncing back, both growing between
10 to 20 percent (y/y) in the second quarter of 2010. Construction activity, however,
appears to remain sluggish with growth of most related imports still negative, while a
late start of the rainy season may dent agricultural output growth.



Inflation and credit: CPI inflation rose to an average 7 percent in the first quarter of
2010, from about -½ percent on average in 2009, on the back of firmer local food and
global commodity prices. Credit growth has turned the corner, reaching 23 percent
(y/y) in August, from 6½ percent at end 2009, amid ample liquidity in the banking
system.



External position: After narrowing somewhat in 2009, the current account deficit is
likely to widen to about 7 percent of GDP (including official transfers) in 2010 on
strengthening domestic demand (Table 2). Official reserves have risen modestly (to
about 3½ months of import cover), while the riel has depreciated somewhat against
the U.S. dollar in recent months.



Exchange rate: Partly as a result of a pre-crisis surge in inflation, the riel appears to
have remained somewhat overvalued in real effective terms, although standard
exchange rate models are unreliable.2 Yet, the rebound of key export sectors in line
with the global recovery suggests that Cambodia’s external competitiveness has
remained intact.

5.
Near-term risks are tilted to the downside. The fragility of the global recovery
exposes Cambodia’s narrow export base with its heavy reliance on the U.S. and European
markets––garment exports to these destinations account for 40 percent of total goods and
services exports–– to significant downside risks, while limited fiscal policy space and

2

Structural changes, the high degree of dollarization and weaknesses in macroeconomic data (for example, the
current CPI measure only tracks prices in Phnom Penh) mean that firm conclusions from such models, such as
the macroeconomic balance approach or the equilibrium REER approach, cannot be drawn. For example, the
REER approach indicates an overvaluation of 14 percent, but parameters are not statistically significant. The
macroeconomic balance approach is highly sensitive to the age-dependency ratio, which in Cambodia’s case is
extremely low due to the genocide under the Khmer Rouge (1975–79). Controlling for this factor, the current
account norm is estimated to be about -5 percent of GDP, somewhat below the forecasted medium-term current
account balance. Nevertheless, the current account deficit remains fully financed by foreign direct investment
(FDI) and concessional aid flows.

financial system weaknesses further undercut the economy’s resilience to shocks. As
highlighted in the accompanying Financial System Stability Assessment (FSSA), the latter
primarily arise from shortcomings in banking supervision, enforcement of regulations and
uneven credit risk management and data reporting by banks, combined with a high degree of
dollarization, severely constraining the central bank’s ability to act as a lender of last resort.
Staff projects growth to reach 4½–5 percent in 2010. Consistent with the recovery, staff
projects the headline CPI index to rise 4 percent on average this year.
6.
Over the medium term, addressing longstanding structural weaknesses can
improve the balance of risks (Table 3). On the one hand, potential setbacks in efforts to
strengthen the business environment and enhance public sector revenues and service delivery
constitute major downside risks to growth. On the other hand, a better-than-expected return
on medium-term investments in the power sector and rural infrastructure could offer
significant upside potential. Under the baseline scenario, growth is expected to gradually
return to potential of about 6–7 percent over the medium term. The current account deficit
(excluding official transfers), after rising early in the recovery (to about 13½ percent of GDP
in 2010) would gradually decline (to about 8½ percent of GDP in 2015), in part reflecting
increasing domestic hydropower supply, and remain fully financed through grants, official
external financing, and foreign direct investment.
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS: RETURNING TO SUSTAINABLE GROWTH
7.
Discussions focused on the dual policy challenge to safeguard macroeconomic
stability and policy credibility, and lay the foundations for broader-based and inclusive
growth. Key policies include: (i) expanding room for fiscal policy maneuver and
effectiveness; (ii) strengthening monetary policy implementation and effectiveness in the
context of a nascent and highly dollarized financial system; (iii) preserving financial system
stability and mitigating systemic risks; and (iv) promoting private sector led economic
diversification in the context of Asia rebalancing.
A. Fiscal Management: Providing Credibility and Change
8.
Following the significant easing in 2009, the fiscal outturn through August
suggests that the 2010 budget target of a gradual fiscal consolidation is on track
(Figure 3, Table 4):


Revenues: The rebound in tax revenue is broadening, with both direct and indirect
cumulative tax collection through the first eight months rising by 11 and 13 percent
(y/y), respectively. In particular, profit tax collection has gained momentum and, since
May has been consistently better than in 2009, supported by the ongoing economic

recovery. In addition, continued efforts to strengthen revenue administration and
reduced incentives for smuggling due to diminishing regional disparities in gasoline
and diesel prices have helped contain tax evasion. As a result, staff estimates that
revenue could exceed the budget target by about ½–1 percent of GDP.


Spending: If current spending remains under control and planned cuts in defense and
security spending continue to be implemented, the current balance could turn positive
(and reach about ¾ percent of GDP) and provide almost half of the funding for the
budgeted locally financed capital spending.



Financing: Higher-than-budgeted disbursements of concessional loans and grants
imply that externally-financed capital spending could exceed the budget by about
1 percent of GDP. While this would result in a higher overall fiscal deficit (including
grants) of 3¼ percent of GDP (compared with about 2¾ percent of GDP in budget),
recourse to domestic financing would be kept well below the budget target (about
1 percent of GDP), and be significantly lower than in 2009.

9.
Staff emphasized the need for fiscal adjustment beyond 2010. Cambodia’s
macroeconomic stability continues to critically depend on prudent fiscal policies.


Staff indicated that as the economic recovery gains traction, the recourse to domestic
financing, and thus the injection of significant additional riel liquidity, should be
eliminated to avoid undue external and inflationary pressures.



Staff’s illustrative medium-term scenario envisages a deficit reduction (excluding
grants) by about 2½ percent of GDP between 2010 and 2015. Under this path, a debt
sustainability analysis indicates that Cambodia would retain its moderate risk-of-debt
distress rating and regain an ability to absorb future shocks similar to pre-crisis levels
(Supplement 1: Joint IMF/World Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis 2010). The
public and external debt-to-GDP ratios would decline to about 26 percent of GDP in
2016, in line with the levels before the global financial crisis. At the same time, the
government would fully replenish its deposits in the banking system, which serve
both as an important reserve to finance fiscal stimulus in the absence of a market for
government debt and as a backstop to financial system fragilities.



Contingent liabilities, in particular those related to the growing number of buildoperate-transfer (BOT) hydropower schemes or banking system weaknesses,
constitute major, but difficult to quantify, risks to the debt outlook. Moreover, a
sooner-than-anticipated shift of aid financing from grants to loans would also add to
the debt burden.



The authorities welcomed the staff’s analysis and reiterated their commitment to
fiscal sustainability. They inquired about the implications of raising their ceiling on

10
contracting external debt from SDR 200 million to SDR 400 million (financing by
about an additional 2 percent of GDP). Staff cautioned that this would delay the pace
of consolidation, and constrain the government’s ability to respond effectively to
further shocks without losing its current moderate risk-of-debt distress rating.
10.
The government is committed to further improving revenue administration. The
team and the authorities concurred that gains in tax collection offer the best hope for
Cambodia to meet the dual objective of securing fiscal sustainability and mobilizing
resources for its vast development needs. Specifically:

The team supported the government’s target of improving the tax revenue to GDP
ratio through better administration by 0.5 percentage points per year, which means
that about one-third to one-half of the revenue enhancing potential would be realized
over the medium term.



There was agreement that much will depend on following through with detailed
action plans of the revenue collecting agencies, including: (i) to enhance taxpayer
compliance through auditing; (ii) information sharing among revenue-collecting and
law-enforcement agencies; (iii) taxpayer education; and (iv) improved governance
within the agencies (notably through better protection of enforcement officers and
disclosure requirements under the recently adopted Anti-Corruption Law). Staff
recommended that a comprehensive strategy to enable a more aggressive collection of
tax arrears, which rose 20 percent in the year ending July 2010, be put in place.

11.
Reducing the scope for evasion will also critically enhance the effectiveness of tax
policy changes that are currently considered with a view to raise revenue. For example,

customs revenue. Smuggling continues to erode
the base, given a stretched porous border. As for domestic taxes, revenue collection falls particularly short
of that of peer countries––at 3½ percent of GDP it is at only 17 percent of Vietnam’s level.

Weak revenue administration is the main factor
for Cambodia’s low fiscal revenue. Staff’s
estimates, based on a sample of 49 developing
countries and controlling for economic
fundamentals (such as level of development,
economic structure, and FDI), show that
Cambodia’s revenue-to-GDP ratio is about
5–7 percent below its potential.1 Estimates,
controlling for country-specific differences in tax
policies,2 suggest that administrative improvements
could make up at least one-half to three-quarters of
Cambodia’s underperformance. The bulk of this
shortfall is attributable to weak administration,
including risk-based tax audits to ensure taxpayer
compliance.

transactions price level would yield about 1 percent of GDP, and higher “sin” taxes on
alcohol and tobacco could generate an additional 0.2 percent of GDP. However, these
calculations assume that the resulting increase in domestic retail prices over those in
neighboring countries does not erode the tax base. This requires that greater incentives for
smuggling are effectively curbed by the envisaged improvements to customs control. From a
strategic perspective, staff and authorities agreed that better information sharing and transfer
of know-how in the fight against tax evasion from the General Customs and Excise
Department to the General Tax Department will also be needed in light of trade liberalization
commitments and the growing reliance on domestic taxes relative to trade taxes. The IMF
stands ready to provide further technical assistance in customs and tax administration.
12.
Stepping up efforts under the public financial management reform program
(PFMRP) will be critical to secure gains from enhanced revenue administration and
improve the effectiveness of social priority spending. Staff welcomed progress in cash
management and budget formulation that has resulted in greater fiscal control through midyear reviews and curbed supplementary expenditure credits, and eliminated expenditure
arrears since 2007. However, budget execution and recording continue to be fragmented,
especially with regard to donor-financed capital spending, hampering an assessment of fiscal
and quasi-fiscal activities and effective budget planning. Moreover, payroll and procurement
controls remain weak with over 60 percent of contracts above the competitive bidding
threshold escaping competitive bidding through regulatory loopholes. Against this
background, staff recommended a focus on those measures under Phase II of the PFMRP that
are both achievable in the near term and of strategic importance. Specifically, the authorities
should: (i) further deepen budget classification at the line ministry level as a precursor to the
introduction of a financial management information system and the planned de-concentration
of budget authority;3 (ii) expedite the consolidation of all government deposit accounts;
(iii) expedite the enactment of the procurement law and strengthen post procurement audit
through increased staffing, funding, and training; and (iv) strengthen internal audit
departments, another important precursor for de-concentration.
13.
Staff welcomed the recent disclosure of revenue information related to oil
exploration. In line with commitments under the PMFRP, staff encouraged the authorities to
consider subscribing to the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) as a means to
signal Cambodia’s strong commitment to improve governance and strengthen fiscal
management. The authorities intend to further strengthen the content and procedure of
dissemination in line with international norms, such as EITI, but cautioned it would be
premature to formally subscribe to the initiative at this stage.

3

Under the PFMRP, line ministries are to be given greater involvement at all stages of the budget process (from
planning to execution) commensurate with their assigned government tasks and objectives.

(given the NBC’s already limited lender-oflast resort capability under dollarization). During the recent crisis, the NBC responded by
reducing the reserve requirement, but interest rates remained virtually unchanged while the
main effect was a liquidity overhang as banks sought self-protection against a possibly severe
liquidity shock (Table 5). At the same time the foreign currency deposits coverage ratio (in
terms of gross official reserves) has steadily declined.

Dollarization has costs and risks: (i) the NBC loses
the lender of last resort ability; (ii) seigniorage revenue
is also lost. Based on a reserve money growth method,
Cambodia is losing an estimated 5 percent of GDP in
recent years. Based on estimates of currency in
circulation in comparator low-income countries in Asia,
seigniorage loss for Cambodia could range from about
5–19 percent of GDP; (iii) the banking system becomes
more exposed to liquidity risk (as shown in the
accompanying 2010 FSSA for Cambodia) where any
sudden changes in investor and depositor perceptions
about the health of the banking system can result in a
deposit run. In fact, the ratio of official reserves to
foreign currency deposits has declined to 70½ percent at
end-September 2010 from 84 percent a year earlier.

Cambodia: Ratio of Foreign Currency Deposits to Broad
Money, 2000-10

Oct-05

Over the past decade, Cambodia has become Asia’s
most dollarized economy. Measured as the ratio of
foreign currency deposits to broad money, dollarization
in Cambodia has risen steadily from about 60 percent in
the late 1990s to about 80 percent in 2010. This
compares with 50 percent in Lao P.D.R., 30 percent in
Mongolia, and 20 percent in Vietnam. Moreover, in
these economies, dollarization has been on a declining
trend or broadly stable.

Sources: Data provided by the Cambodian authorities; and IMF staff estimates.

Somewhat paradoxically, growing dollarization in Cambodia has occurred against the backdrop of
greater macroeconomic and political stability. The usual motive, currency substitution, does not appear to
have been a factor. As the use of dollars increased over the years, the use of the riel, in volume, has also risen.
Banking system riel deposits have grown fourfold since the mid 2000s. Dollarization resulted from a strong
inward flow of dollars. Growth in Cambodia’s dollar economy, that is largely urban, has far surpassed growth
in the riel economy, which remains largely agricultural and rural. The dollar economy has benefited from the
buoyant garments sector, tourism, foreign direct investment, and aid, contributing to robust growth in related
sectors and a wider use of the dollar. The rural economy, however, has lagged behind. For example, during
2000–08 real annual GDP growth in the manufacturing and hotel and tourism sectors averaged 10½ percent,
more than double the rate of growth for agriculture.
Therefore, de-dollarization will likely take time and needs to be managed carefully. International
experience from successful cases of de-dollarization (e.g., Israel, Poland, Chile, and Egypt) shows that marketbased policies toward de-dollarization work best. From these studies, several measures will be needed in
Cambodia, including: (i) maintaining macroeconomic stability; (ii) promoting intermediation in the riel and
building a liquidity line of defense, specifically by having a higher reserve requirement on foreign currency
liabilities to make such liabilities more costly, and accumulating international reserves for liquidity support
and help reduce the perception of a weak domestic currency; (iii) building monetary policy tools and
establishing an interbank market; (iv) promoting the use of the riel as a unit of account possibly through
regulation that requires all prices in the market to be denominated in riel, and that the riel be used for all
accounting and financial reporting and official purposes; and (v) promoting the use of the Cambodia riel for
payments by offering more convenient and lower-cost services for the riel than for foreign currency. For
example, Peru introduced a 2 percent tax on checks denominated in foreign currency to discourage the use of
foreign currency for payments.

15
mechanisms with the National Treasury and other agencies under the Ministry of Finance.
Staff recommended that an independent in-house research unit for macroeconomic analysis
and forecasts be established to help inform the recently established Monetary Policy
Committee (MPC). The NBC should also strive to disseminate more frequent and up-to-date
data and analysis on monetary and credit developments, including on its website, which
would provide valuable experience for moving to more comprehensive communications with
market participants, including on MPC decisions. Staff and the authorities agreed that the
development of an interbank money market (in both U.S. dollar and riel) is important for
reducing the vulnerabilities induced by a dollarized financial system, and for a more effective
implementation of monetary policy. Staff emphasized that progress along these lines would,
over time, create space for moving away from exchange rate-based stabilization.
16.
Staff cautioned the authorities to monitor closely the current liquidity overhang.
To avoid undue pressures on inflation and the exchange rate from resurgent credit growth as
the recovery strengthens, the NBC should be prepared to increase the reserve requirement on
foreign currency deposits. Gradually returning reserve requirements on U.S. dollar deposits
to their pre-crisis level (of 16 percent) and beyond, if necessary, will serve as an important
signaling device for banks while minimizing the risk of disrupting their operations. In order
to do so, the authorities intend to step up daily liquidity monitoring of banks and, with IMF
technical assistance, assess the impact of changes in the reserve requirement on banks’
liquidity positions.
17.
The authorities recognized that greater monetary independence will also
critically depend on a national strategy of de-dollarization. To a large extent,
dollarization reflects Cambodia’s unbalanced and narrow growth over recent decades that
was driven by the dollarized urban export and tourism centers (Box 2). Therefore, staff
underscored the need for diversified development with greater emphasis on agriculture and
rural areas, where the riel is commonly accepted, to help contribute toward a decline of
dollarization. Staff further argued that based on international experience of countries with a
successful de-dollarization strategy, the incentives for greater use of riel could be increased
by: (i) a greater differential in reserve requirements in favor of riel deposits, which would
make bank intermediation in riel more attractive and also mitigate bank’s liquidity risks
arising from a run on dollar deposits in the absence of a lender of last resort; (ii) a
requirement for all retailers to list prices in riel; (iii) promoting the use of riel for payments
by circulating bills of larger denomination and introducing a clearance tax for checks
denominated in foreign currency. However, many cases of failed de-dollarization attempts
show that going beyond incentives and taking administrative measures, such as prohibiting
foreign currency deposits, is often counterproductive and undermines confidence in the
local currency.

16
C. Financial Supervision: Mitigating Systemic Risks and Preserving Stability
18.
In addition to being highly dollarized, Cambodia’s financial system is relatively
shallow. The legacy of civil strife and demonetization under the Khmer Rouge (1975–79)
still casts a long shadow on public confidence. Bank credit to the private sector is low at
about 26 percent of GDP. Over 95 percent of banking system deposits are denominated in
U.S. dollar. While many new banks have been licensed in recent years, the system is
dominated by five large banks (two of which are foreign owned) accounting for nearly
80 percent of credit. Rural areas are primarily served by micro-finance institutions,
representing less than 10 percent of financial system assets.
19.
While the banking system emerged seemingly intact from the financial crisis,
significant risks to stability remain. The sharply slowing economy and collapse of the real
estate market in 2009 likely weakened banks’ balance sheets severely. The findings of onsite
examinations of several banks by supervisors suggest that the reported aggregate NPL ratio
for 2009 of around 4 percent may be substantially understated, largely due to uneven
implementation and enforcement of the strengthened regulation on asset classification.
Furthermore, the general lack of effective risk management by banks remains of concern
(Table 6). Having said that, the ongoing recovery provides an opportunity to clean up bank
balance sheets and reduce financial system vulnerabilities while maintaining confidence.
20.
Staff stressed that robust financial sector oversight is a precondition for a more
resilient financial system that would enable Cambodia to meet its economic potential.
Staff welcomed the authorities’ desire to make use of the findings and recommendations of
the recent IMF/World Bank Financial Sector Assessment Program (Box 3). Specifically:


Staff welcomed renewed hiring efforts to address the shortage of human resources
and enhance technical capacity. However, staff strongly recommended that a
moratorium on new bank licensing be formally placed as long as supervisory capacity
and resources are inadequate. In light of the significant role of foreign controlled
banks in Cambodia, staff welcomed the recent agreement with Malaysia’s bank
supervisors on enhanced supervisory collaboration as it represents a potential tool to
ease capacity constraints and initiate cross-border supervision.



While recognizing the authorities’ efforts toward preparing a memorandum of
understanding between relevant government agencies on crisis management, staff
cautioned against further delays and urged that the most immediate requirement is to
establish a mechanism for dealing with systemic and illiquid or insolvent banks.
Moreover, the framework will need to be anchored in an explicit financial stability
mandate for the NBC. Given the absence of financial safety nets, staff also urged that
the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) regulation be enhanced.

17

Box 3. Key Challenges for Financial System Stability
The March 2010 FSAP identified a number of key challenges to financial system stability. At the
core, the responsibilities of the NBC’s Banking Supervision Department clearly outstrip its capacity and
resources. Moreover, examinations remain compliant-based and do not adequately assess risk, and there is
inadequate offsite monitoring, limited follow-up of onsite examination findings, and weak enforcement of
laws. At the same time, core financial soundness indicators compiled by the NBC are based on unreliable
data reported by banks. In particular, the credit and solvency risks of banks (as represented by their NPL
and capital adequacy ratios, Table 6) may be

minimum required CAR than reported
data suggest.
Against this background, the highest-priority FSAP recommendations are:


Human resources. Addressing the acute shortages of human resources and lack of technical capacity
is of paramount importance and very high on the NBC’s agenda. Operationalizing the memoranda of
understanding with foreign supervisors may alleviate the burden on the NBC’s limited resources.



Crisis management framework. This will be critical to help maintain confidence in the financial
system and minimize fiscal risks. The PCA regulation needs to be enhanced given the absence of
financial safety nets. The framework will also need to establish a mechanism for dealing with
systemic and illiquid or insolvent banks. An explicit financial stability mandate for the NBC is
also recommended.



Strict enforcement. In particular, the new regulations on asset classification and provisioning, and
on minimum capital requirements will be an important litmus test for the NBC and the government
and define the supervisor’s credibility going forward. However, with the framework for bank
resolution, liquidation, and mergers not well formed, the NBC will have to evaluate its options
carefully when implementing the new minimum capital requirements to avoid damaging the
confidence in the system.



Legal framework. A strategic plan is needed to address gaps, conflicts, and overlaps in the financial
sector legal and regulatory frameworks (e.g., between the banking and securities laws).

18


Staff commended the authorities for intensifying their actions with banks toward
meeting the new minimum capital requirement by end-2010. This together with strict
enforcement of new regulations on asset classification and provisioning will define
the supervisor’s credibility.

21.
Over the medium term, staff advised that the supervisory framework will need
to keep pace with the development of a broader financial system. Regulations for riskbased and forward-looking supervision should be implemented, and consolidated supervision
at the bank level should be conducted by the NBC. Also, an adequate regulatory and
supervisory framework for the securities market needs to be put in place. Modalities for
enhanced cooperation and coordination between the NBC and other domestic supervisors
must be clearly defined and agreed upon through memoranda of understanding.

Against this background, staff and authorities agreed that recent initiatives to
improve the business environment and address infrastructure bottlenecks are critical
and timely. Staff welcomed the recently promulgated Anti-Corruption Law, which could
significantly reduce the cost of doing business–– noting that Cambodia ranks low in a
number of governance indicators––thereby improving Cambodia’s international
competitiveness.5 Renewed emphasis on agricultural development and rural infrastructure

Box 4. Cambodia’s New Rice Policy
Under the motto, “Rice—White Gold,” the government’s new rice policy adopted in 2010 is a fiveyear plan that focuses on expanding the production and export of rice. Rice is Cambodia’s main crop,
accounting for about 50 percent of total crop production and some 7–8 percent of GDP. Production in
2010 could reach 7.3 million tons, of which an estimated 3.1 million tons is needed for local consumption.
Factoring in seed and post-harvest losses, more than 3.3 million tons would be available for exports.
However, according to official statistics, only about 30,000 tons (less than 1 percent) are exported,
suggesting that owing to a lack of processing and warehousing capacity, as well as formal export
arrangements, Cambodia’s potential to tap world markets remains largely unrealized.
The policy looks at all aspects of the value-chain and has the following key objectives:


Facilitating trade. Through reducing informal fees, eliminating illegal checkpoints, boosting
warehousing and rice milling capacity, creating a one-stop service for export processing, and creating
an independent body to certify and grade products according to standards of importing countries.



Raising productivity. Paddy rice yield in Cambodia is low, only 2.6 tons per hectare compared with
4.9 tons per hectare in Vietnam. In the near term, using higher yield seeds, expanding irrigation
systems, and facilitating quicker customs clearance for imports of inputs will help improve
productivity. In the longer term, the policy aims at modernizing farming techniques. Through 2015
total rice production is targeted to increase by 24 percent to 9.1 million tons.



Addressing land issues. Only about 10 percent of farmers have land titles. The policy plans to use
zoning to clearly demarcate land for agriculture while improving land titling to enable farmers to use
land as collateral for loans to finance critical investments and working capital.



Improving the infrastructure including reducing energy costs. Energy costs account for about
25 percent of total production costs. Energy prices in Cambodia are generally double those in
neighboring countries, primarily because of the heavy reliance on petroleum for electricity
generation. Plans to build new hydropower plants with donor support over the medium term and use
alternative sources of energy will help reduce costs.

sources of growth, make future development more inclusive, and help Cambodia maintain its
good track record toward achieving the Millennium Development Goals (Table 7).
24.
Staff underscored the need for better and faster data for key economic statistics
in order to further enhance policy credibility and better inform business decisions. In
addition to addressing weaknesses in fiscal and financial data mentioned in paragraphs 12
and 19, it will be important to further improve the accuracy and timeliness of national
accounts statistics. Noting that the release of official 2009 GDP statistics was still subject to
data revisions, staff recommended that the provisional estimates shared by the National
Institute of Statistics be enhanced to fully incorporate available data on trade, the financial
sector, and fiscal accounts.

20
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
25.
Economic setting: After a decade of high growth and relative stability, the recent
global crisis brought to the fore Cambodia’s longstanding structural vulnerabilities. Output
contracted in 2009, as Cambodia was hit harder than comparator countries by the global
recession, given its narrow export base. As a result, the incidence of poverty likely rose after
several years of steady progress toward achieving the Millennium Development Goals. A
broadening export-led recovery, however, is under way.
26.
Outlook and risks: The fragility of the global recovery exposes Cambodia’s narrow
export base with its heavy reliance on the U.S. and European markets to significant downside
risks in the near term. Banking system weaknesses, a high degree of dollarization, and
limited fiscal policy space further limit the economy’s resilience to shocks. Addressing
longstanding structural weaknesses can improve the balance of risks over the medium term.
In this context, potential setbacks to strengthening the business environment and enhancing
public sector revenues and service delivery constitute major downside risks to growth, while
a better-than-expected return on medium-term investments in the power sector and rural
infrastructure could offer significant upside potential.
27.
Fiscal policy: Recent data indicate that fiscal consolidation is on track to meet the
2010 budget target. As the recovery gains traction, further fiscal consolidation and the
elimination of domestic financing needs should be pursued. Revenue mobilization remains
key to expanding fiscal space, while ensuring fiscal sustainability and progress toward
development objectives. Stepping up public financial management reform and effectiveness
of priority social and infrastructure spending will also be important.
28.
Monetary and exchange rate policy: While policies of the NBC have contributed to
macroeconomic stability, this stability has not delivered the desired greater monetary
independence. Exchange rate based stabilization has tended to conflict with the need to
facilitate adjustment to external shocks as well as to protect official reserves. To help move
away from exchange rate-based stabilization over time, there is a need to: (i) implement a
comprehensive liquidity monitoring framework and putting in place the required
coordination and information-sharing mechanisms within the government; and (ii) develop
an interbank money market. In light of the large liquidity overhang, the authorities should
stand ready to remove the monetary easing bias to preempt potential undue pressures on
reserves and a credit boom. Greater monetary independence will also critically depend on a
national strategy of de-dollarization.
29.
Financial sector policy: Implementation of high-priority FSAP recommendations
will help address key challenges to financial system, stability including data inadequacies
impairing financial system surveillance, and weak supervisory and regulatory frameworks,
and safeguard the hard-won, but limited, confidence in the banking system. In particular,
addressing the shortage of human resources and enhancing technical capacity; establishing

21
agreements with foreign supervisors; putting in place a crisis resolution framework;
addressing gaps in banking sector laws and regulations and the shortcomings in the antimoney laundering, and combating of financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) area; and enforcing
existing regulations that are essential to reduce systemic risks, and limit potential fiscal costs.
30.
Economic diversification: Diversified private sector-led growth is important for
raising Cambodia’s growth potential. Strengthening the investment climate, expanding
market access through trade commitments, and enhancing rural infrastructure are all
important to help Cambodia tap new markets in the context of Asia rebalancing. In this
regard, implementation of the recently promulgated Anti-Corruption Law could significantly
reduce the cost of doing business and improve Cambodia’s international competitiveness.
The government’s renewed emphasis on agricultural development and rural infrastructure
investment could help broaden sources of growth and directly reduce poverty.
31.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard
12-month cycle.

CAMBODIA
Joint IMF/World Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis 20101
Prepared by the staffs of the International Monetary Fund and
the International Development Association
Approved by Masahiko Takeda and Dominique Desruelle (IMF)
and Carlos Alberto Primo Braga and Vikram Nehru (IDA)
October 15, 2010
This document presents the joint IMF-World Bank debt sustainability analysis (DSA) for
Cambodia using the Debt Sustainability Framework (DSF) for Low-Income Countries
(LICs).2 It shows that Cambodia faces a moderate risk of debt distress. While external debt
burden indicators do not breach the relevant policy-dependent indicative thresholds under
the baseline scenario, the debt level is sensitive to shocks as indicated in standard bound
tests.3 There are also considerable downside risks related to the uncertainty about a
sustained global recovery, and possible contingent liabilities from infrastructure projects
and the banking system. Moreover, increased borrowing over the next three years, as
currently considered by the authorities, would reduce the scope for absorbing additional
risks. All this underscores the need for a prudent borrowing strategy, underpinned by
continued fiscal consolidation over the medium term, careful selection of investment projects
to ensure they are growth-enhancing, and improvements in debt management capacity.

This DSA was prepared jointly by the IMF and World Bank. Staffs also collaborated with the Asian
Development Bank. Debt data for this exercise were provided by the Cambodian authorities and donor partners.

The low-income country debt sustainability framework (LIC DSF) recognizes that better policies and
institutions allow countries to manage higher levels of debt, and thus the threshold levels for debt indicators are
policy dependent. Cambodia’s policies and institutions, as measured by the World Bank’s Country Policy and
Institutional Assessment (CPIA), averaged 3.26 over the past three years. Since this average exceeds the
threshold of 3.25 for the first time only and the excess is marginal, the country remains classified as a “weak
performer” for this fiscal year. The relevant indicative thresholds for this category are: 30 percent for the NPV
of debt-to-GDP ratio, 100 percent for the NPV of debt-to-exports ratio, 200 percent for the NPV of debt-torevenue ratio, 15 percent for the debt service-to-exports ratio, and 25 percent for the debt service-to-revenue
ratio. These thresholds are applicable to public and publicly-guaranteed external debt.

2
I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Cambodia’s DSA indicates that the risk of debt distress is moderate. Under the
baseline scenario, external debt burden indicators do not breach the relevant indicative
thresholds. However, in standard alternative scenarios and stress tests, two debt indicators
(debt-to-GDP and debt-to-revenue ratio) breach indicative thresholds for several years
(Figure 1).
2.
Staffs have analyzed an additional country-specific alternative scenario of
increased bilateral external borrowing over 2011–13. This scenario is mainly for
information purposes as the authorities inquired about the implications for fiscal
sustainability of temporarily increasing their legal limit on new borrowing to finance more
development projects. The legal limit on the new borrowing of SDR 200 million per year was
already once relaxed temporarily in 2009 to weather the impact of global crisis. The
government returned to the original borrowing limit in 2010. The terms of borrowing are
assumed to be less concessional than those from multilateral donors, similar to China’s terms
(20-year maturity, 7-year grace period at 2 percent interest). The analysis indicates that
Cambodia’s scope for absorbing additional risks would be significantly reduced.
II. BACKGROUND AND ASSUMPTIONS
3.
At the end of 2009, Cambodia’s external public and publicly-guaranteed (PPG)
debt stock was around 28 percent of GDP in nominal terms and 22 percent in net
present value (NPV) terms.4 Until 2008, strong economic growth and favorable external
conditions contributed to a decline in debt ratios. However, since 2009, the external PPG
debt ratios have risen, partly reflecting increased assistance from existing and emerging
donors in the face of the global recession. As a result, the PV of debt to revenue was around
189 percent, approaching the 200 percent threshold. For 2010, the debt stock in PV terms as
a share of GDP, as a share of exports of goods and nonfactor services, and of government
revenues is projected at 23 percent, 42 percent and 178 percent, respectively.

Government deposits with the domestic banking system exceed the stock of loans
from the banks to the government. At the end of 2009, the stock of recorded domestic
public debt was equivalent to slightly less than 1 percent of GDP, while government deposits
amounted to about 5 percent of GDP.
6.
Cambodia remains in arrears to the Russian Federation and the United States.
Following a Paris Club agreement in 1995, Cambodia concluded agreements with France,
Germany, Italy, and Japan. Negotiations of outstanding debt obligations with the Russian
Federation and the United States are ongoing, with their status effectively unchanged since
the last DSA. Currently, Cambodia is not servicing its debt with either of these creditors, and
efforts to conclude agreements with each under the framework of the Paris Club are required.
In September 2010, the Cambodian government announced it would demand cancellation of
its debt to the United States. Since prospects for resolution are unclear, the current DSA
assumes no restructuring in its baseline, with arrears continuing to build up throughout the
projection period. In measuring debt levels, the DSA incorporates the negotiated debt stock
for the Russian Federation (US$457 million) and the agreed amount of the total principal
owed to the United States (US$162 million).5
7.
The main underlying macroeconomic assumptions are presented in Box 1. The
baseline scenario assumes a deficit reduction (excluding grants) by about 2½ percent of GDP
between 2010 and 2015.

5

For this DSA, staffs continue to apply the standard 70 percent discount to the nominal value of debt owed to
the Russian Federation.

4

Box 1: Main Assumptions for the Baseline Scenario (2010–30)


After a sharp slowdown in 2009, the Cambodian economy is expected to recover with real GDP
growth at 4½–5 percent in 2010, as garments exports, in particular to the U.S., and tourism activity
normalize. However, construction is likely to remain sluggish given the ongoing need to repair balance
sheets and unwind the excess from the pre-2008 local real estate boom. As a result, the economy will only
gradually return to potential growth of about 6–7 percent. Important drivers of future growth will be new
export opportunities in agri-business to markets in Asia as well as higher returns from tourism. Cambodia
would continue to serve as a useful platform for China’s textile industry. All this will depend on
improvements in the investment climate and recovery of FDI. Over the longer term, FDI is expected to be
sustained at around 5–6 percent of GDP per year. Improvements in the domestic banking system would
also result in increased domestic private investment. Inflation is projected to decline gradually from
4.5 percent in 2010 to around 3 percent over the medium term.



The external current account deficit (including official transfers) is projected to widen in 2010 to around
9 percent of GDP, compared to 7 percent in 2009, as the recovery in garment exports and the tourism sector
is more than offset by higher imports and increases in commodity prices. The macroeconomic framework
incorporates recent projects in the power sector (some of which are already underway), which increases
imports and FDI in the near term. However, over the medium and long term, growth in the import of
petroleum products would decline, reflecting increases in the domestic power supply from hydropower
plants. Over the longer term, the current account deficit is expected to settle in the range of 4–5 percent of
GDP a year. Official assistance (grants and loans) would decline gradually as a share of GDP, while FDI
and other private inflows would rise. Gross official reserves, which are expected to be around
US$2.6 billion (3.6 months of next year’s imports) at end-2010, would stabilize at around three months of
imports with more stable import demand over the longer term.



Macroeconomic stability is underpinned by a gradual consolidation from a sharp rise in the overall fiscal
deficit in 2009. For 2010, the overall deficit is expected to decline to around 5.9 percent (excluding grants)
from 8.1 percent in 2009 and lower domestic financing needs. Thereafter, the deficit is projected to decline
gradually to around 3.4 percent by 2015. Revenue (excluding grants) would rise to around 15 percent of
GDP by 2015 as a consequence of a broadening of the tax base, further administrative improvements, and
buoyancy from the projected recovery, with more moderate increases thereafter (see accompanying
2010 Article IV staff report). Expenditures would decline to 18.2 percent of GDP by 2015, down from
18.8 percent in 2010, with some slowing in the growth of recurrent spending and a return of capital
spending to the range of 6½–7 percent of GDP under more normal growth conditions.

While an economic recovery is under way, the fragility of the global recovery exposes
Cambodia’s exports with their narrow base and heavy reliance on the U.S. and European
markets to significant downside risks in the near term. Banking system weaknesses and a
limited room for maneuver with regard to fiscal policy further undercut the economy’s ability
to absorb additional shocks. Addressing longstanding structural weaknesses, improving the
business environment and public sector service delivery may positively affect the balance of
risks over the medium term. The development of extractive industries is not factored into the
baseline, given uncertainties about the timing and revenue impact of new oil, gas, and
mineral production.
8.
Contingent liabilities exist in several areas that require close scrutiny because of
the potential burden on external and public debt. Cambodia has signed several buildoperate-transfer (BOT) projects—mainly related to new projects in the power sector. Contingent

5
liabilities arising from these types of contracts are not incorporated in this DSA because of a
lack of information on the total amounts and terms of these agreements. The authorities
indicated that they are working to collect necessary details and should be able to provide this
information by next year. Other contingent liabilities could arise if the mitigation of risks in the
banking sector necessitated government guarantees. Moreover, a shift of aid financing from
grants to loans could also add to the debt burden. In light of Cambodia’s need for major
infrastructure investment and given its limited scope for servicing larger levels of debt, the
authorities should monitor these types of commitments closely and transparently, including by
developing and maintaining an inventory of all concessions granted and building and improving
capacity to analyze the impact of contingent liabilities on debt sustainability.
III. EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
9.
All external debt indicators remain below the policy-dependent debt burden
thresholds under the baseline scenario, but thresholds are breached under the standard
bound tests.6 The main results of the external DSA are as follows (Figure 1):


Under the baseline scenario, all external debt indicators remain below the threshold in
2010 and decline further over the medium and long term.



In one bound test, two indicative thresholds are breached, in the case of the debt-torevenues ratio for several years (Table 1b). Following a one-time 30 percent nominal
depreciation of the Cambodian riel vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar relative to the baseline in
2011, the NPV debt-to-revenue ratio increases to about 235 percent in 2011 and then
declines gradually below 200 percent by 2015. The NPV debt-to-GDP ratio also
temporarily breaches the threshold and peaks at 31.4 percent in 2011 before falling
under 30 percent in 2013.7



The debt service-to-exports and debt service-to-revenue ratios stay well below the
indicative threshold throughout the entire projection period due to concessionality of
earlier debts.

10.
As an additional country-specific alternative scenario, this DSA considers the
impact of increased bilateral borrowing.

6

Historical averages are generally inadequate as a basis for generating stress tests and alternative scenarios for
Cambodia because the post-conflict period between 1995 and 2005 was characterized by rapid catch-up growth
from a very low base.

7

However, the relevance of this shock is questionable in Cambodia given the high degree of dollarization of the
economy. For instance, the ratio of foreign currency deposits to broad money is about 80 percent and about half
of tax revenues, although paid in local currency, are collected on imports. Assuming that 80 percent of GDP is
effectively denominated in U.S. dollar in line with Cambodia’s high degree of dollarization, the NPV of debt to
GDP ratio would remain below the threshold under all standard stress tests.

6


The authorities have inquired about the fiscal-sustainability implications of doubling
their own legal ceiling of loan financing from SDR 200 million to SDR 400 million
(about 2 percent of GDP) for the next few years to finance more capital projects. The
terms of borrowings are assumed to be similar to those of bilateral loans from China
(20-year maturity, 7-year grace period, 2 percent of interest), and the old ceiling
would be reinstated in 2014.



In the event, the debt level would rise and Cambodia’s scope for absorbing additional
risks would be significantly reduced (Figures 3 and 4, Tables 3a, 3b, 4a, 4b). In
several bound tests, the indicative thresholds are breached for three years or more.



With no information on the type of projects to be financed, it is difficult to project
any positive impact of this additional borrowing on GDP growth and other parameters
of Cambodia’s overall capacity to absorb debt. Therefore, the calculations in the
alternative scenario do not assume any “growth dividend”. However, in order to
return debt levels under this scenario by 2020 to those comparable to the baseline
scenario, and thus achieve a similar capacity to absorb risks over the medium-to-long
term, the growth dividend would need to be significant. On average, annual GDP
growth would need to be 1.7 percentage points higher than in the baseline scenario
(implying a 25 percent upward shift of potential output growth), while revenue
growth would have to be increased even slightly more than that, suggesting additional
efforts would be needed to boost the buoyancy of the tax system. Moreover, the still
limited administrative capacity of the government in effectively managing capital
spending and delays in the public management reform program would make
achieving this growth dividend even more difficult.

11.
Staffs view that Cambodia faces a moderate risk of debt distress. Although only
two indicators appear sensitive to stress testing, risks are to the downside, given the
uncertainty related to implicit contingent liabilities, including from a weak banking system,
and possible delays in the operation of hydropower plants. Moreover, the debt dynamics
could evolve rapidly, and should the government decide to increase external borrowings, its
ability to withstand further shocks are significantly circumscribed. Under these
circumstances, improved fiscal management, especially through revenue administration,
would enable Cambodia to establish a sound footing for much needed development projects
and provide greater room for external loan assistance.
IV. PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
12.
Given that most public debt is external, the dynamics of public debt behave
similarly to those of external debt in the previous section. The nominal stock of public
debt, equivalent to 29 percent of GDP at the end of 2009, is expected to rise to 31 percent by
end-2010 (Table 2a and Figure 2), reflecting the accommodative fiscal stance. Under the
baseline, it would begin to decline as a share of GDP in 2011, as the DSA is based on current
policies, which at present do not anticipate issuance of domestic debt.

7


The PV of public sector debt-to-GDP ratio―23 percent for 2009―would rise to around
24 percent by 2010 before gradually declining to around 18 percent by 2020 (Table 2b).



The PV of public debt-to-revenue ratio (inclusive of grants), which is estimated to be
144 percent in 2009, would rise to 153 in 2010 then decline to 97 percent by 2020.



The debt service-to-revenue ratio remains low in most scenarios for the entire
projection period under the baseline.

13.
Public debt ratios are sensitive to a continued accommodative fiscal stance and a
permanent growth shock. Under two of the alternative scenarios—an unchanged primary
balance from 2010 or GDP growth permanently lower by one percentage point—the level of
public debt (as a share of GDP) continues to rise over the projection period, reaching
44 percent and 39 percent, by 2030. Under these scenarios, the debt-to-revenue ratio would
reach 222 percent and 191 percent, and the debt service-to-revenue ratio would reach 29 and
22 percent respectively by 2030. Bound tests also reveal a sensitivity of public debt ratios to
a 10 percent increase in other debt creating flows (Table 2b). This is particularly relevant
because of the potential risks posed by implicit contingent liabilities. Public debt ratios are
also sensitive to a one-time 30 percent real depreciation, although, as noted above, this is a
less relevant bound test for Cambodia.
V. CONCLUSION
14.
Staffs conclude that Cambodia faces a moderate risk of debt distress. External
debt burden indicators do not breach the thresholds under the baseline scenario. Only two
thresholds are breached under the standard stress tests. However, this outlook could
deteriorate in the event that actual liabilities arise from contingent obligations, mainly those
related to hydropower plants, other major public infrastructure investments, and the banking
sector. Any increased borrowing should be carefully contemplated, as it could significantly
limit the government’s ability to respond to any future crisis.
15.
Given the uncertainty about near- to medium-term prospects, staffs urge the
Royal Government of Cambodia to continue pursuing a sound strategy for public debt
management. Careful consideration is needed in advance of possibly contracting less
concessional loans and providing direct and indirect government guarantees, as they could
impair sustainability, in particular if the revenue base remains low and institutions weak.
Stronger capacity in debt management is an essential prerequisite for less concessional
borrowing and other financing arrangements such as BOTs. Staffs also encourage the
authorities to continue seeking agreements to resolve outstanding arrears.

1/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
2/ Includes both public and private sector external debt. The years in the table refer to calendar years.
3/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
4/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections, also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
5/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
6/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

Debt service-to-revenue ratio

Sources: Cambodian authorities; and staff estimates and projections.
1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), noninterest current account in percent of GDP, and nondebt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline, while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock
(implicitly assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

1/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
2/ The public sector debt represents general government gross debt.
3/ Gross financing need is defined as the primary deficit plus debt service plus the stock of short-term debt at the end of the last period.
4/ Revenues excluding grants.
5/ Debt service is defined as the sum of interest and amortization of medium- and long-term debt.

Sources: Cambodian authorities; and staff estimates and projections.
1/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
2/ Includes both public and private sector external debt. The years in the table refer to calendar years.
3/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
4/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections, also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
5/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
6/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

Debt service-to-revenue ratio

Sources: Cambodian authorities; and staff estimates and projections.
1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), noninterest current account in percent of GDP, and nondebt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline, while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock
(implicitly assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative:

As part of the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI), the IMF Executive Board on January 5,
2006 approved relief on 100 percent of debt incurred by Cambodia to the IMF before January 1,
2005. This resulted in the forgiving of all of Cambodia’s outstanding debt to the IMF, a total of
SDR 56.8 million (about US$82 million). The authorities intend to spend the resources over a
number of years, initially on rural irrigation projects. The National Bank of Cambodia (NBC)
transferred the full MDRI proceeds to the Ministry of Economy and Finance effective March 2006.

3
VIII.

Safeguards Assessment:

A voluntary safeguards assessment of the National Bank of Cambodia (NBC) was completed
in January 2010, at the request of the authorities. The assessment updated the previous
voluntary assessment completed in March 2004. It found that the NBC had taken steps to
strengthen aspects of its safeguards framework, although important measures proposed in
2004 are still outstanding or in progress. Some new risks have emerged in the area of external
audit. The assessment made appropriate recommendations.
IX.

Exchange Rate Arrangement and Payments System:

Cambodia’s exchange regime is classified as stabilized. The official exchange rate, which is
expressed in riels per U.S. dollar, applies to all official external transactions conducted by the
central government and state enterprises, and is used for accounting purposes by the NBC. It is
determined by the foreign exchange market, with the official rate adjusted to be within 1 percent
of the market rate on a daily basis.
Cambodia accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 on January 1, 2002.
Cambodia maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on the making of payments and
transfers for current international transactions.
X.

Article IV Consultation:

Cambodia is on the standard 12-month Article IV consultation cycle. The last Article IV
consultation discussions were held in Phnom Penh during September 9–23, 2009. The
Executive Board discussed the staff report (IMF Country Report 09/325) and concluded the
consultation on November 18, 2009.
XI.

Technical Assistance:

Technical assistance is currently focused on bank supervision, monetary operations, public
financial management, customs administration, and macro-financial statistics. Delivery is through
a resident advisor at the NBC, peripatetic experts, and short-term visits from headquarters.
XII.

Resident Representative:

The resident representative office was closed in October 1997 and re-opened in October 1999,
headed by an IMF Resident Representative until June 2010. Since then, the IMF’s Resident
Representative for Indonesia, Mr. Milan Zavadjil has also assumed the responsibilities for the
Cambodian IMF office.

4
ANNEX II. CAMBODIA: WORLD BANK-IMF COLLABORATION

1.
The Bank and the IMF country teams for Cambodia, led by Mr. Mathew Verghis
(Lead Economist, EASPR) and Mr. Olaf Unteroberdoerster (IMF Mission Chief for
Cambodia), maintain a close working relationship and have an active dialogue on a range of
macroeconomic and structural issues.
2.

Recent key areas of cooperation and coordination includes:
(i) Macroeconomic policy advice to the authorities: The IMF and the World Bank
staff have consulted each other on key macroeconomic policy messages to the
authorities and avoid sending conflicting messages. We have adopted a joint stance
on the complex question of the 2009 national accounts (for which our best estimates
suggest a contraction of GDP, while the Cambodia National Institute of Statistics
suggests a slightly positive growth of 0.1 percent). The two teams also regularly
share information outside missions and discuss and exchange institutional views on
key macroeconomic developments. Bank staff share and discuss the monthly fiscal
monitor and the quarterly review of macroeconomic developments. IMF staff share
policy notes and other mission preparatory documents.
(ii) Financial Sector Reform/TA and FSAP: World Bank and IMF teams have
worked closely while undertaking the March 2010 FSAP. The two teams sent
respective representatives jointly in 2009 to appraise the authorities about the
purpose, structure, output, and requirements of an FSAP. The two teams also
regularly communicated on financial sector developments throughout the
assessment. Following the recommendations advanced by the FSAP team, it is
expected that technical assistance will be deployed in subject areas akin to the
FSAP, which will assume close coordination between the IMF and the
World Bank.
(iii) Public Financial Management and Tax and Customs Administration Reform:
Both institutions are working to strengthen coordination of work on public
financial management, and tax and customs administration reform. Both teams
share as much as possible the work done in this area.
(iv) Article IV Consultations: IMF Article IV consultations regularly share their
macroeconomic data with the World Bank and hold working sessions to try and
reconcile macroeconomic data sets. The collaboration is closest on the Debt
Sustainability Analysis, a joint product, but extends more broadly into other areas
of the Consultation as well. This is extremely important for both institutions in
Cambodia’s data scarce context. World Bank staff are also invited to and do
participate in some of the key meetings.
(v) Structural reforms: The IMF staff and the World Bank teams have worked
together to share views on a range of other issues, including structural reforms for
a better investment climate (and competitiveness issues), rural development, and
de-dollarization.

5
3.
It is recognized that the modality of the partnership will be tested by the
departure of the resident representative at the end of June 2010. While the IMF maintains
an office in Phnom Penh, with local staff, the Resident Representative (Mr. Milan Zavadjil) is
now based in Indonesia and visits Cambodia every six to eight weeks. Collaboration has
continued to be excellent so far, but will inevitably require adjustments to these new
circumstances. This is in particular the case for the IMF’s involvement on the Public Financial
Management Reform Program, for which the previous resident representative had played a
very active role.
4.
Based on the above intensive partnership, the World Bank and the IMF share a
common view about Cambodia’s macroeconomic and structural reform priorities.
These include:


Promoting long-term growth and diversification: While Cambodia has been very
successful at achieving sustained rapid growth since the late 1990s, the global crisis has
highlighted some of the vulnerabilities of this performance. In particular, the lack of
diversification and the weaker progress in rural development are key challenges.



Sustaining the recovery: As of September 2010 (the IMF just concluded its Article IV
consultation mission), the recovery is well under way. However it needs to be sustained
with appropriate fiscal consolidation and continued management of the banking sector
risks.



Increasing fiscal space: Increase fiscal space—better enforcement of revenue policy
should be a priority of fiscal policy. Additional fiscal space should be well targeted to areas
that would increase growth potential (e.g., infrastructure related constraints) or target the
most vulnerable (e.g., to implement the recently developed Social Safety Net strategy). We
also agree on the importance of public sector compensation reform, if planned in a coherent
fiscal framework and accompanied with necessary human resource reforms.



Strengthening the banking system: The joint World Bank/IMF FSAP includes a number
of recommendations to tighten bank supervision and develop a crisis resolution
framework, in order to safeguard the stability of the banking system and facilitate its
continued development in support of economic growth.



Improving governance: Both the World Bank and IMF have stressed the critical role of
governance in improving the quality of service delivery and the business environment. For
instance, in the Article IV consultations, the role of EITI and the recently-adopted AntiCorruption Law were stressed.

5.
The teams are committed to continue the close cooperation going forward.

ANNEX III. CAMBODIA: RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
(As of August 31, 2010)
From 1992 through August 31, 2010, the Asian Development Bank (AsDB) approved funding
of $1,254.7 million including 49 loan projects of $1,064.8 million with low interest, and
13 Asian Development Fund (ADF) grants of $189.9 million ($42.0 million in 2005; $7.8
million in 2006; $37.0 million in 2007; $30.3 million in 2008; and $72.8 million in 2009) to
Cambodia for structural reform programs. To date, 33 loan projects for a total of $732.9
million and two ADF grants of $14.5 million have been completed.
The sector composition and loan/grant amount of the remaining active portfolio as of
August 31, 2010 are: (i) agriculture and natural resources $123.4 million; (ii) education
$76.6 million; (iii) energy $64.3 million; (iv) finance $10.0 million; (v) health, nutrition, and
social protection $9.0 million; (vi) industry and trade $15.6 million; (vi) law, economic
management, and public policy $6.1 million; (viii) transport and communication
$163.3 million; and (ix) water supply, sanitation, and waste management $39.0 million.
The AsDB’s overarching goal in Cambodia is sustainable poverty reduction. The AsDB’s
Country Strategy and Program (CSP 2005–09) midterm review, finalized in August 2007,
concluded that the strategic thrust of the AsDB in Cambodia remains appropriately targeted
on poverty reduction through broad-based private sector-led growth, inclusive social
development, and stronger governance for sustainable development. The new Country
Partnership Strategy (CPS 2010–13) is under preparation and guided by the AsDB’s longterm strategic framework (Strategy 20201) to support implementation of the government’s
updated National Strategic Development Plan 2009–13 (NSDP Update2). The AsDB’s
Country Operations Business Plan (COBP 2009–12) strongly focuses on the priority areas of
agricultural and rural development, private sector development, governance and capacity
development, and regional economic integration in the Greater Mekong Sub-region (GMS).
Interventions in agricultural and rural development focus around the Tonle Sap basin area and
are geared to improving livelihoods of the poor through management of water resources and
irrigation assets, as well as agriculture extension services and crop diversification; expanding
the connectivity internally between rural roads and the provincial and national network, and
externally with emerging subregional transport corridors; fostering the development of
smallholder agricultural producers; and widening access for the poorest to rural water supply
and sanitation while strengthening local community management capacity.

8
In the area of private sector development, the AsDB assists the government’s effort in
improving competition policy and regulatory efficiency; strengthening the investment climate
and innovation; and continuing trade policy reforms and trade facilitation (customs and
sanitary and phytosanitary standards for food safety). Assistance has also been provided to
help the Government improve its competitiveness at the GMS level through reducing borderrelated costs and distortions; improving physical infrastructure; enhancing transport and trade
facilitation, including promoting compliance with SPS standards. Later interventions would
be more focused on improving the trade facilitation and logistical links to the subregion as
systems and procedures become more developed and integrated. The AsDB assistance in the
financial sector has helped the government in improving financial intermediation; enhancing
the resilience of the financial sector; promoting good governance; and improving financial
sector efficiency. Education-related interventions help to promote equitable access to quality
secondary education and technical and vocational education and training to achieve the
Cambodia Millennium Development Goals and sustainable growth. There is also a gradual
increase in the AsDB private sector operations such as an intervention to expand trade
finance. Other infrastructure loans and investment opportunities are being sought, including in
the areas of (i) energy, (ii) transport, (iii) agribusiness, and (iv) water and sanitation.
With respect to governance and capacity building, the COBP includes a programmatic
approach to public financial management (PFM) reform with interventions to underpin rolling
out of PFM to rural development line ministries (support for budget preparation and
execution, financial management and reporting, procurement and development of internal
audit capacities in these ministries) and strengthen the capacity of the National Audit
Authority. At the same time, the AsDB will also promote good governance through assistance
to the government led-decentralization and de-concentration reform, namely support to
functional assignments and fiscal decentralization and decentralized services deliveries. The
assistance in PFM for rural development together with sector interventions will reinforce
decentralization and de-concentration reforms, particularly in functional assignments and
expenditures responsibilities. Assistance is also planned to support the implementation of the
anti-corruption law passed in April 2010.

ANNEX IV. CAMBODIA: STATISTICAL ISSUES
As of September 30, 2010
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance. Extensive technical assistance (TA) has been provided by the
IMF, UNDP, Asian Development Bank, and World Bank, as well as from bilateral partners (namely Japan and Sweden),
leading to substantial capacity improvements in compiling and reporting macroeconomic statistics. However, various
shortcomings in macroeconomic data still hamper timely and comprehensive analysis.
National Accounts: The National Institute of Statistics is leading efforts to improve the consistency of national accounts
statistics with the United Nations’ System of National Accounts 1993, to expand the range of annual national account
aggregates, and to produce a quarterly national accounts series since June 2005, with IMF technical assistance. However, the
quality of GDP estimates remains hampered by the lack of comprehensive and reliable source data on a production and
expenditure basis, in part stemming from the need to address resource constraints and improve data collection techniques. The
authorities have not yet published the 2009 national accounts.
Price statistics: A new consumer price index series was introduced starting in January 2009. However, geographical coverage
of the series is limited to Phnom Penh. Statistics Sweden is currently providing TA on price statistics, including on compiling
a production price index.
Government finance statistics: The Ministry of Finance and Economy began implementing reforms to the government
accounting system and budgetary nomenclature in 2007 based on the Government Finance Statistics Manual (GFSM) 2001,
with IMF TA. In addition, several STA missions have assisted with GFS compilation procedures within the GSFM 2001
framework. IMF TA in April 2008 assisted with establishing a bridge between the government’s new chart of accounts (COA)
and the GSFM 2001 classifications so that accounting records can be used as source data in compiling GFS. However, use and
coverage of the COA has been limited and not fully integrated to activities such as the disbursement of external loans and
grants, the government’s budget reserve fund, and capital expenditures.
Monetary and financial statistics: The National Bank of Cambodia (NBC) compiles the balance sheet and survey for the
central bank and other depository institutions in accordance with the IMF’s Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual. Since
August 2005, the NBC has reported monthly monetary and financial statistics to STA using the Standardized Report Forms.
The NBC received TA during the FSAP on the compilation of financial soundness indicators (FSIs). The NBC now compiles
monthly core FSIs and shares them with IMF staff irregularly. The non reliability and inconsistency of data reported by banks
still poses a challenge to the interpretation of FSIs.
External sector statistics: Despite recent improvements, more work is needed to improve balance of payments statistics.
Customs data have substantial coverage and valuation problems arising from the use of reference prices and limited recording
of non dutiable imports, underreporting of re-exports, and weaknesses in customs controls. Enterprise transactions, such as
payment for imported services, income payments, and portfolio investment abroad are excluded or underreported. Foreign
direct investment, which is believed to be large, relies excessively on approvals. Gaps exist in external debt statistics, in
particular, on the stock of public and publicly-guaranteed debt by maturity, on bilateral donor disbursements, and on external
debt service. Gaps exist in official transfers (e.g., grants) and in external statistics, and no data are available for private
external debts.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
October 28, 2010
This statement provides information on macroeconomic and policy developments that has
become available since the circulation of the staff report. The information does not alter the
thrust of the staff appraisal.
Economic recovery and trade. The pickup in economic activity has continued
through September and is evident in the
real growth of exports of garments and of
key imports including cars, gasoline, and
motorcycles. However, construction-related
imports remain weak. Tourist arrivals
through August are up 16 percent (y/y), on
the back of continued strong inflows from
neighboring countries and a rebound in air
arrivals (up 14 percent). In line with the
recovery, credit growth in September
remained robust at 23 percent (y/y). Both
gross official reserves and the exchange
rate have remained virtually unchanged.

Inflation. Headline inflation eased in the third quarter of 2010 (to about 2 percent y/y),
driven by lower food prices, in part reflecting seasonal factors.
2011 draft budget. A draft 2011 budget was approved by the Council of Ministers on
October 15, 2010. Final parliamentary approval is expected in mid-December. The budget
proposal is broadly in line with staff’s projection and advice, but there are some differences.
In particular:


To support fiscal consolidation, overall spending would be kept at ¼ percent of GDP
below the staff projection. However, with a more conservative revenue forecast
(½ percent of GDP below staff projection), the overall deficit would decline by only
¼ percent of GDP (½ percent in the staff projection).



In spite of the compression of overall spending (relative to the staff projection), the
budget contains larger-than-expected capital spending and social priority outlays
(each ¼ percent of GDP above staff projection). This implies a larger compression of
nonpriority current spending than staff considered likely.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
December 14, 2010

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2010 Article IV Consultation
with Cambodia
On October 29, 2010, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Cambodia.1
Background
Cambodia enjoyed a decade of high growth and relative stability prior to the crisis. Real GDP
growth averaged over 9 percent during 2000–07, the highest of any low-income country in
Asia, enabling significant improvements in living standards and poverty reduction. Prudent
fiscal policies underpinned macroeconomic stability with headline inflation well below
Cambodia’s peers.
However, the global crisis resulted in a growth collapse, exposing longstanding structural
vulnerabilities. Preliminary estimates suggest that growth fell some 10 percentage points below
its pre-crisis average in 2009. Cambodia was hit harder than comparator countries by the global
recession, given vulnerabilities that are in part a legacy of a generation lost by civil strife. Fiscal
revenues, that remain low regionally, limit the scope to fully address development priority
needs, while a shallow and highly dollarized financial system undercuts broad-based growth
and complicates macroeconomic management. Growth and exports have remained narrowbased, offering limited benefits to the rural poor, Cambodia’s vast majority. As a result, there are
indications that poverty increased after several years of steady declines, setting back the
momentum toward achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
The authorities’ policy response to the crisis helped limit the impact. The government raised
wages and accelerated development spending, allowing the overall fiscal deficit to increase to
over 8 percent of GDP in 2009, up by more than 5 percentage points over 2008. While the
deficit was mostly financed by concessional loans and grants, there was also significant
recourse to domestic financing (nearly 2 percent of GDP) for the first time since 2003. In
addition, the National Bank of Cambodia (NBC) took an accommodative stance by reducing
reserve requirements (from 16 to 12 percent) and introducing an overdraft facility. However, as
a result of banking system weaknesses, the main effect was to offer a cushion against a liquidity
shock in addition to banks’ own efforts, including by raising deposit rates that contributed to a
significant rise in liquidity in the banking system.
A broadening export-led recovery is under way. Garment exports and tourist arrivals, notably by
air, are bouncing back, both growing between 10 to 20 percent (y/y) in the second quarter of
2010. Construction activity, however, appears to remain sluggish with growth of most related
imports still negative, while a late start of the rainy season may dent agricultural output growth.
Consumer price inflation rose to an average 7 percent in the first quarter of 2010, from about
-½ percent on average in 2009, on the back of firmer local food and global commodity prices.
Credit growth has turned the corner, reaching 23 percent (y/y) in August, from 6½ percent at
end 2009, amid ample liquidity in the banking system. After narrowing somewhat in 2009, the
current account deficit is likely to widen to about 7 percent of GDP (including official transfers) in
2010 on strengthening domestic demand. Official reserves have risen modestly (to about
3½ months of import cover), while the riel has depreciated somewhat against the U.S. dollar in
recent months.
Near-term risks are tilted to the downside. The fragility of the global recovery exposes
Cambodia’s narrow export base with its heavy reliance on the U.S. and European markets––
garment exports to these destinations account for 40 percent of total goods and services
exports––to significant downside risks, while limited fiscal policy space and financial system
weaknesses further undercut the economy’s resilience to shocks. These weaknesses arise from
shortcomings in banking supervision, enforcement of regulations and uneven credit risk
management and data reporting by banks, combined with a high degree of dollarization,
severely constraining the central bank’s ability to act as a lender of last resort. Staff projects
growth to reach 4½–5 percent in 2010. Consistent with the recovery, staff projects the headline
CPI index to rise 4 percent on average this year.
Over the medium term, addressing longstanding structural weaknesses can improve the
balance of risks. Potential setbacks in efforts to strengthen the business environment and
enhance public sector revenues and service delivery constitute major downside risks to growth.
However, a better-than-expected return on medium-term investments in the power sector and
rural infrastructure could offer significant upside potential. Growth is expected to gradually
return to potential of about 6–7 percent over the medium term. The current account deficit
(excluding official transfers), after rising early in the recovery (to about 13½ percent of GDP in
2010) would gradually decline (to about 8½ percent of GDP in 2015), in part reflecting

3
increasing domestic hydro-power supply, and remain fully financed through grants, official
external financing, and foreign direct investment.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors commended the authorities for their timely policy response, which had helped mitigate
the impact of the global crisis and supported the nascent recovery. Directors noted, however,
that to achieve sustainable broad-based growth, it will be necessary to address the economy’s
long-standing structural weaknesses which were exposed by the global crisis. This includes
expanding the limited fiscal space; strengthening monetary policy, especially in light of high
degree of dollarization; preserving financial system stability; and promoting private sector-led
economic diversification.
Directors concurred that prudent fiscal policy remains critical for maintaining macroeconomic
stability. They were encouraged that fiscal consolidation was on track to meet the 2010 budget
target, and called for further progress to increase fiscal space to address shocks over the
medium term. Directors noted that stepped-up efforts on revenue mobilization, including tax
administration and prudent borrowing policy, are crucial for achieving fiscal sustainability, while
providing resources to meet pressing development needs. At the same time, efforts should also
continue to strengthen public financial management to ensure effectiveness of priority social
and infrastructure spending.
In light of the large liquidity overhang in the banking system, Directors encouraged the
authorities to stand ready to remove the monetary easing bias to preempt potential pressures
on financial stability. They agreed that, in the medium term, greater monetary independence will
hinge critically on a market-based strategy of de-dollarization and require carefully sequenced
measures to strengthen the monetary framework, including through the development of an
interbank money market.
Directors considered the findings of a recent Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP),
including risks to the financial system stability in the absence of significant reforms. They
encouraged the authorities to implement high-priority FSAP recommendations, with appropriate
technical assistance, to enhance financial system surveillance, improve supervisory and
regulatory frameworks, and thus safeguard the hard-won confidence in the banking system.
Directors welcomed the steps taken by the authorities to address data weaknesses and acute
shortage of human resources, and to enhance technical capacity. They emphasized that
upgrading and enforcing the legal framework and developing a safety net are essential to
addressing systemic risk and limiting potential fiscal costs.
Directors noted that the authorities’ renewed emphasis on agricultural development and rural
infrastructure investment is critical and timely. Greater efforts in this area should help broaden
sources of growth and reduce poverty. Strengthening the environment for private-sector led
investment and expanding market access will also play an important role in improving
Cambodia’s international competitiveness.

Statement by Duangmanee Vongpradhip, Executive Director for Cambodia, and
Pijeivibol Phan, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
October 29, 2010
1.
On behalf of the Cambodian authorities, we would like to thank the IMF mission
and the FSAP team for visiting Phnom Penh and engaging in the fruitful dialogue with
the authorities during a crucial time when the country has been undergoing reforms to
underpin macroeconomic stability after the crisis. The authorities also wish to thank staff
for their thoughtful recommendations. The exchange of views during the mission was
candid. The authorities are in broad agreement with the general thrusts of staff’s
assessment and policy recommendations.
Recent Economic Developments and Outlook
2.
Having been hit hard by the external sector last year, Cambodia’s macroeconomic
performance and outlook has regained strength as the recovery has picked up quickly
since the last quarter of 2009 owing to the authorities’ prompt policy response to boost
the economic activities. The recovery is supported by strong rebound in garment exports,
tourism and to a lesser extent agriculture. The authorities are in broad agreement with
staff’s growth projection for this year within the range of 4.5 – 5 percent. The growth will
soar close to its pre-crisis level in the medium term. The strong rebound in the garment
sector reflects the improved productivity in terms of quantity and quality, the lower
domestic production costs, and the increase in offshore demand for Cambodia’s product.
The number of tourist arrivals, especially by air, is increasing owing to the government’s
policies to promote tourism and the strength of regional economies. Agriculture is
expected to grow at a moderate rate due to late rain. The authorities share staff’s view
that downside risks remain on the fragile global recovery.
3.
The external position has deteriorated somewhat due to stronger rebound of
imports to support the reviving domestic demand. The current account deficit (including
official transfers) is projected to increase to 7 percent of GDP in 2010 from 5.2 percent
the previous year. This was mainly due to the increase in trade deficit to 18 percent of
GDP. Exchange rates remain relatively stable. The inflation pressure has eased markedly.
The following low growth of domestic retail oil prices and the earlier anticipation of good
harvest in the second half of the year have also helped ease the pressure on inflation. The
authorities agree with staff that the inflation will remain below 5 percent at the end of this
year. Renewed increase in food and commodities prices in the international market
following natural calamities experienced in the region and in the country would be a near
term risk to price stability and economic developments.
Fiscal policies
4.
On the fiscal sector, the stimulus package had helped boost the economy. Prudent
fiscal policy also serves the country well in sustaining fiscal credibility. The overall

2
performance this year has been strong with the expectation of meeting the expenditure
and revenue targets envisaged in the 2010 Budget Law. Going forward, given the limited
room for fiscal maneuver, the authorities agree with staff to continue implementing fiscal
consolidation in order to strengthen fiscal sustainability. While believing that much of the
necessary consolidation will have to come mainly from the revenue side, the authorities
view that it is difficult to cut expenditures especially those related to social spending and
public investment projects already in the pipeline.
5.
On the revenue side, collection is expected to exceed the target. However, the
authorities recognize that realizing the full potential of revenue collection from a narrow
base is challenging and required years of reforms. They are requesting technical
assistance from the Fund for improvement in this area. They are committed to improve
revenue collection through: 1) improvement of tax administration and enlargement of the
tax base, 2) closer coordination and data sharing among revenue agencies, and 3)
enforcement of the newly enacted Anti-Corruption Law. On the expenditure side, the
authorities are committed to prudent fiscal expenditure to strengthen fiscal management
and credibility. The planned cuts in wage bill are on track with the budget. In the medium
term, the current expenditure will be kept at the same rate as a percentage of GDP.
Expenses related to agriculture, education, and health will be increased by about 10
percent each. The capital expenditure will also increase by about 15 percent in 2011, with
expected funding comes primarily from external sources.
6.
In the authorities’ view, long-term fiscal consolidation efforts require long-term
commitment toward improving revenue collection, prudent expenditure and cautious
borrowing. Great care will be given to new concessional borrowings to finance necessary
infrastructure and growth-enhancing projects, with the objectives to progress toward
achieving the MDGs by 2015. Assistance and grant from development partners will help
contribute significantly to these objectives.
Monetary and exchange rate policies
7.
The characteristic of the economy this year is shown by slowly depreciating
exchange rates, smoothly declining interest rates in the credit market, and easing
inflationary pressure. The authorities believe that in a highly dollarized economy like
Cambodia, exchange rate stability serves the country well and help anchor inflation
expectation. Since May this year the National Bank of Cambodia (NBC) has injected
over US$ 40 million into the economy to stabilize the foreign exchange market. The
depreciation of the riel was a result of the increased government’s spending in local
currency associated with the stimulus package implemented since last year.
8.
The monetary policy easing had been withdrawn and policies going forward will
remain unchanged although closer attention is paid to the credit quality and the banking
system liquidity overhang. The NBC are monitoring the system liquidity on a daily basis

3
to avoid undue pressures on inflation and the exchange rate. They plan to set up lesscostly money market instruments such as certificate of deposits and monetary
stabilization bonds to promote interbank markets and improve the efficiency of monetary
policy. They reiterate their stand to leave the reserve requirement ratio unchanged at 12
percent on foreign currency denominated deposits and 8 percent for domestic currency
denominated deposits. As deposit increases, broad money and credit to the private sector
are expected to increase at a similar annualized rate of over 20 percent. The foreign
exchange reserve has also increased to a more comfortable level.
Financial and banking issues
9.
The financial sector is growing rapidly. The banking sector total assets currently
stand at about half of the size of GDP. Cambodia is expected to set up its money and
capital markets in the near future, as outlined in the Financial Sector Development
Strategy 2006-2015. However, much of the prerequisite works remain to be done for the
groundbreaking. The requested FSAP diagnostic on the financial system earlier in the
year has produced welcoming results. The authorities are committed to implementing the
FSAP recommendations as highlighted in the FSSA report. Preparation is under way with
assistance from the MCM to lay out a plan to implement the FSAP recommendations
with short-term priority given to enhancing capacity in bank supervision, strengthening
liquidity forecasting and monitoring framework, and preparing legal base for
harmonizing coordination among supervisory agencies, and with medium-term priority
given to developing crisis management framework and improving laws and regulations.
These developments present serious challenges to the authorities’ limited capacity and
they have requested the Fund’s technical assistances in these areas.
10.
The banking system remains sound as banks are adequately capitalized. Customer
confidence in the system remains strong despite sudden withdrawals by depositors
following the unrest at the border last year. The run on deposits only occurred at a few
branches located near the border and on a very small scale. The effect on customer
confidence was very minimal as deposits kept increasing afterwards. During the crisis,
non-performing loans (NPLs) were rising and banks’ balance sheet provisions were made
appropriately. However, as the economy started to recover, business profits have
resumed, NPLs have fallen, and banks’ capital adequacy ratios have remained well above
regulatory threshold. The stress test result conducted by the FSAP team was very helpful.
The NBC will monitor closely the level of NPLs and ensure that the unlikely breakingpoint NPL ratio for each bank will not materialize.
11.
The NBC’s efforts to reform the banking sector, especially the current
recapitalization reform, have made remarkable results. So far, over 90% of banks are well
recapitalized. The authorities are enforcing the remainder to fully comply with the
regulation. On the AML/CFT, the AML/CFT Law was promulgated in 2008 and the
Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) was formed and housed under the central bank umbrella

4
with the Board of Directors consisting of representatives from the Council of Minister,
the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Interior, the Ministry of Economy and Finance
and the NBC. The body is responsible for receiving, analyzing, and disseminating reports
on suspicious transactions and other information regarding AML/CFT.
Structural Reforms
12.
The authorities have stepped up efforts to improve business climate and create an
environment conducive to promote private sector-led growth. They have put in place
measures to develop agriculture, agro-processing industry and SMEs and to diversify
export base. One of the main challenges to the initiatives is the lack of capital investment.
They invite the private sector to help contribute in this area. Cambodia also faces other
challenges such as the lack of skilled workforces (especially middle management level)
and institutional capacity, and the need for improved competitiveness, trade facilitation,
border efficiency and infrastructure development. They have expressed commitment to
overcome these challenges. They welcome participation from all development partners
and private sector in this regard.

One of the good news is that domestic hydro energy production will come on
stream by 2012. This will help reduce the production costs and improve Cambodia’s
price competitiveness. However, in terms of human resources, the objective is to produce
the right people for the right jobs for the economy. To produce skilled workforces,
vocational trainings are needed. We also need to strengthen institutional capacity. These
objectives however will not be realized without assistance from development partners.
The authorities are committed to improving trade facilitation and border efficiency.
Further efforts are needed to develop infrastructure especially in the rural areas. A new
Anti-corruption Law has been passed by the National Assembly and an Anti-Corruption
Body has been set up to implement and enforce the Law.
Conclusion

The authorities have learned from the recent crisis experience and transformed it
to an opportunity to identify their own weaknesses and to take steps to scale up reforms
aimed at addressing those weaknesses and develop a framework for sustainable mediumto long-term growth. However, due to the country’s limited resources and policy spaces
at the current juncture, joint participations among all stakeholders including the
government, private sector and development partners are much needed. The authorities
would like to underscore their commitment to reforms supported by technical assistance
from all development partners including the Fund and the Bank.
