Executive Summary
Macroeconomic imbalances have widened in 2004 putting at risk some of the earlier
achievements. Aggregate demand has surpassed supply and spilled over to imports, as slow
structural reforms have kept too much labor and capital in uncompetitive activities. As a
result, exports have remained at a third of imports, inflation picked up, and the external deficit
widened. External vulnerability has increased with the recent build-up of new external debt,
although private, to finance imports.
The attempts to deal intermittently with the rising inflation or the external balance with
exchange rate policy have failed to reduce the imbalances due to persistent structural
rigidities. The use of exchange rate depreciation to lower the external balance led to surging
inflation, given the high euro-indexation of prices and the small share of competitive supply.
Similarly, fixing the exchange rate to bear down on inflation worsened the external balance, as
a rigid spending structure limited fiscal tightening and loose wage policy boosted demand.
The main challenge to policies is to reduce these trade-offs by faster structural reform,
while maintaining macroeconomic stability with tighter fiscal, monetary, and incomes
policies. While policy implementation in a fragile political environment will not be easy, the
recent advances towards EU accession help “draw the road map” to sustainability. The
authorities have recently chosen to use again the exchange rate to reduce inflation. To
succeed, this would require:
•

Fiscal policy. To reduce risks for the current account of slower depreciation and
increase public savings, fiscal policy needs to be tightened substantially, and its
flexibility increased by reducing the large share of non-discretionary spending. This
leaves no room for tax cuts in the near term, and calls for reforms in pensions and
subsidies to defunct enterprises.

•

Monetary policy. The high level of euroization, partly a reflection of the frequent
shifts in exchange rate policy, complicates monetary management. Nevertheless,
monetary policy needs to be tightened to slow the credit boom and foreign borrowing
by increasing reserve requirements and repo operations, and continuing the use of
prudential measures.

•

Banking reform. The successful bank privatization should continue, with the entry of
new banks boosting competition. Bank supervision is to be strengthened to deal with
increased foreign currency risk and credit activity.

•

Structural reform. Finalizing the privatization and liquidation of socially owned
companies, restructuring state enterprises, and strengthening financial discipline are
key to allocating resources for growth and stability given the external financing
constraints from high debt levels.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
The 2005 Article IV consultation takes place at an opportune time. First, with
rising inflation and persistently high current account deficits, SM is at a critical juncture to
preempt a further increase in macroeconomic vulnerabilities. Second, the current Extended
Arrangement (EA) is drawing to an end in 2005, and the authorities need to decide whether
to request a successor arrangement. Third, recent successes towards European Union (EU)
accession may consolidate policy reform. Against this background, the Article IV
consultation offers an opportunity to take stock of achievements in creating a sustainable
basis for growth, and to determine reform priorities.

II. MACROECONOMIC PERFORMANCE SINCE 2002 HAS BEEN MIXED1
3.
Macroeconomic imbalances have widened in 2004, putting at risk some of the
earlier achievements (Tables 1–2, Figures 1–2):
•

GDP growth in recent years has been driven mainly by domestic demand.
Despite a steady 5 percent growth in non-agriculture since 2002, output is barely over
half of its pre-transition level, as slow structural reforms have kept competitive
supply and exports low.2 At the same time, a solid growth in remittances and large
real wage hikes, peaking at 35 percent in 2002–03, have fuelled domestic demand.

Stabilization in SM has been supported by a three-year Fund arrangement approved in 2002 (Box 1).

Close to 20 percent of labor is still employed in largely unrestructured state and socially-owned enterprises.

kept the private sector share in the economy at a
low 50 percent. The resulting low level of exports and high demand pressures contributed to
the large structural trade deficit and made disinflation more difficult.
While the EA-supported-program helped stabilize the economy and sustain growth, the
current account deficit and inflation have not declined as envisaged. Despite declining,
and lower-than-programmed fiscal deficits, demand outpaced supply and boosted imports
resulting in a larger current account deficit. Weak incomes policies were unable to arrest large
real wage increases that fed demand, along with remittances. A further impetus came from
strong credit growth as bank privatization brought in new foreign banks, and greater
confidence increased deposits. As the slow restructuring of the enterprise sector kept
competitive supply limited, excess demand boosted imports. Disinflation was complicated by
the shifts in exchange rate policy between fixing the dinar and generating real depreciations, as
pass-through from exchange rate changes was reflected in prices. Structural reform was
accelerated in 2004, which together with the tightening of macroeconomic policies is projected
to bring down the current account deficit and inflation.

Demand was particularly strong in 2004, as a boom in credit from newly established
foreign banks and access to foreign loans by recently privatized companies reduced
savings needs, and unleashed pent-up consumption and, increasingly, investment.
With the limited domestic growth potential, the increased demand spilled over to
imports, widening the current account deficit, and boosted inflation. Since mid-2004,
there are signs of an incipient recovery in exports from recently privatized
companies, but it is too early to draw firm conclusions of a new trend.
The resulting large structural current account deficit has become unsustainable
with the surge in debt-financing. The lack of competitive supply has made the trade
deficit highly sensitive to demand pressures. As a result, imports have increased to
about half of GDP, while exports have remained at about 17 percent of GDP. Despite
attempts in 2003–04 to accelerate the real depreciation of the dinar to boost
competitiveness, the current account deficit has remained high at 12-15 perc`ent of
GDP, reflecting the structural nature of the imbalance.3 The recent surge in debtfinancing of the deficit makes it unsustainable, and increases the country’s
vulnerability to shocks via the exchange rate.4 The high debt level also limits future
reliance on foreign savings to boost growth. The large inflows of capital increased
gross international reserves to US$4.3 billion by end-2004, close to 4 months of
projected imports.

Some of the large current account deficit in 2004 (about 1.7 percent of GDP) is explained by a temporal shift
of imports between 2004 and 2005 in anticipation of the introduction of the VAT in January 2005.

influenced by lagged effects of a weak incomes policy in 2002–03, as administrative
prices are only gradually adjusted for wage increases.5 Much of the decline in
inflation to single digits in 2003, despite wage and exchange rate pressures, likely
reflected a pre-election freeze in administrative prices. These pressures were partly
unleashed towards end-2004 with large hikes in administered prices.6 Inflation in
2004 was also influenced by higher fuel prices and strong wage growth until midyear. While monthly inflation has started to decline in early 2005 in response to the
slower dinar depreciation and policy tightening, continued strong demand and
delayed administrative price adjustments are likely to keep price pressures strong.

reforms has led to the
share of non-discretionary spending (wages, subsidies, and transfers) remaining high
at over 70 percent of total expenditures. As a result, the tax burden and the size of
government, with expenditures at 45 percent of GDP, continue to be the highest in the
region, reducing the flexibility of fiscal policy in demand management.

These still account for 40 percent of the RPI basket.

Estimates in a selected issues paper on inflation indicate that the pass-through from dinar depreciation to prices
increased to 0.7. The spike in inflation in early 2005 was also influenced by the introduction of the VAT.

Monetary policy, weakened
by increasing euroization, has been accommodating (Table 6). The shifts in
exchange rate policy in Serbia to deal intermittently with rising inflation or the
external deficit have reduced confidence in the dinar and led to increasing currency
substitution.7 The latter was compounded by the negative real interest rates on dinardenominated deposits. Rising euroization has reduced monetary policy effectiveness
and contributed to the increased pass-through from the exchange rate to prices. At the
same time, successful bank restructuring and privatization, and the attendant
remonetization coupled with the quest for market share by newly established foreign
banks with access to foreign borrowing, contributed to a credit boom in 2004, which
exacerbated demand pressures. As the monetary policy tightening in mid-2004 was

insufficient to contain the credit boom, the NBS in late-2004 complemented this by
tighter prudential measures. While these have halted the growth of consumer loans,
other credits continued to expand in 2005. The entry of new banks with the expected
advances in privatization in 2005 will increase these pressures further. In
Montenegro, which adopted the D-mark in 1999, later replaced by the euro, inflation
has stabilized at 3–4 percent (Box 2).
•

The slow structural reform is at the core of the macroeconomic imbalances and
rigidities (Figure 4). As the public sector still produces about half of GDP,
competitive supply is small, and too much capital and labor are trapped in overstaffed
and unreformed public and socially
owned enterprises.8 The weak

through enterprise restructuring. The
slow progress in improving the business environment10 has also weighed on
productivity, discouraged investment, including FDI, and increased costs of doing
business.
III. SHORT AND MEDIUM-TERM MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND RISKS

5.
The outlook for growth in 2005 and beyond is favorable under prudent policies
(Table 7–8, Figure 5). Gradually increasing annual growth to over 5 percent over the
medium term should be feasible, given the output gap relative to its level 15 years ago. This
will require an increasing investment-to-GDP ratio from the current 18 percent, in particular
by a reallocation of resources within the economy from the inefficient state and socially

Box 2. Recent Developments in Montenegro under Euroization
Adoption in 1999 of the D-mark, subsequently the euro, as legal tender has lowered inflation to
low single digits. Widespread use of the D-mark in transactions and prices, and a desire to shield the
economy from high inflation rates in Serbia were main factors contributing to the decision of full
official euroization. This coincided with a rapidly stabilizing inflation, which dropped from over 100
percent to 3-4 percent in two years.
However, failure to contain demand pressures and slow structural reform have kept growth
modest and the external deficit large. A relatively loose fiscal stance, rapid credit growth, and
availability of external credit led to a rising domestic demand, which was largely met by imports. The
slow structural reforms have kept exports at low levels and dependent on a few volatile commodities
and tourism. Wage and demand pressures have also appreciated the real exchange rate, eroding the
competitiveness of the tradable sectors. Much of the import demand has been satisfied by foreign
borrowing, increasing external vulnerability to sudden changes in market conditions.
Current account and fiscal deficits are large and the real exchange rate
is appreciating.

Speedier structural reform and stronger demand management would boost growth and external
sustainability. The fiscal stance needs to remain cautious to contain demand for imports. The high
dependency on aluminum and tourism for export earnings requires a capacity to accommodate sudden
shifts in external demand. A sound underlying fiscal position, including low levels of public debt,
would enhance the ability to mitigate the impact of shocks. In this context, privatization receipts in
2005 (about 10 percent of GDP) could be used to reduce public sector debt, and to build a fiscal
reserve to serve as a buffer for future adjustment needs.

owned enterprises to achieve continued growth in productivity and exports. There was broad
agreement that faster structural reforms are key to achieving this.
6.
The current account deficit is unsustainable at present levels and must be
reduced steadily. Continued demand and price pressures make lowering the deficit to
11 percent of GDP in 2005 a challenge. The large investment needs, and pent-up consumer
and investment demands, are likely to put pressure on foreign savings. Rapid restructuring
and prudent demand policies would help increase investment, exports, and FDI and lower
the current account deficit towards 10 percent of GDP over time, with debt-financing
declining in line with higher FDI. But even with a prudent policy scenario, the debt-to-GDP
ratio would at best stabilize at its current level of 54–55 percent, highlighting external
vulnerabilities.
7.
Inflation pressures remain strong. The authorities expect that a more stable
exchange rate and the recent policy tightening would lower inflationary expectations and
bring inflation towards single digits by end-2005, admitting, however, that the risks are on
the upside. In their view, the recently adopted tougher policies should help achieve this. The
staff noted that this is likely to be a challenge, even if demand is reduced further, as inflation
in the first five months already reached 7.1 percent. Furthermore, pressures from higher
international energy prices and suppressed administered prices make a single digit inflation
hard to reach even in the coming years.

The fixing of the dinar tamed inflation in 2002 at the expense of the
current account...

Sources: National authorities, and Fund staff estimates.

9.
Much of the discussions focused on the difficult trade-off between inflation and
current account objectives, in an environment of persistent structural rigidities. There
was agreement on the diagnosis that the intermittent use of the exchange rate since 2002 to
either lower inflation or the external deficit has led to widening macroeconomic imbalances,
despite broadly prudent fiscal and monetary policies, and to a reduced confidence in the
dinar as evidenced by increasing euroization. To a large extent this reflects a failure to deal
with the underlying structural rigidities in the economy, and weak incomes policy until mid2004. The increasing euroization and euro-indexation of prices has reduced monetary policy
effectiveness and made inflation increasingly sensitive to exchange rate movements. The
rigid structure of public spending, stemming from a large share of non-discretionary
expenditure, in particular transfers, has limited fiscal policy flexibility in demand
management. Failure to privatize and restructure a large part of the enterprise sector with
weak financial discipline has kept competitive supply below potential and fuelled large
wage increases. The resulting excess demand has spilled to imports and inflation, leading to
the macroeconomic imbalances.
10.
There was broad agreement that structural problems and reform are the main
cause of and cure for the macroeconomic imbalances, but that these will take time to
take effect. Even with extraordinary efforts, the full impact of reforms in the state and
socially owned enterprises on potential growth and the current account deficit will only be
felt in the medium term. Fiscal and monetary policies will need to remain tight until then.
11.
Exchange rate policy and the accompanying policy mix were at the core of the
discussions. The authorities insisted on shifting the focus of exchange rate policy to
reversing the inflation trend by a slower depreciation of the dinar, to be accompanied by
prudent macroeconomic policies, including incomes policy. The staff pointed to the high

- 14 -

risks of this option, as it would require a further tightening of demand through fiscal,
incomes, and monetary policies to safeguard the current account objective and to arrest a
further build-up of external debt. It could also increase the balance sheet risks of banks, if
foreign exchange risk is underestimated. Therefore, this option may not be sustainable
against the background of past inability to increase fiscal policy flexibility by addressing the
rigid structure of public spending, and the limited effectiveness of monetary policy.
Reliance on incomes policy in demand management can also be risky in a politically fragile
environment, and it indeed often failed in the past, resulting in large real wage rises.
Furthermore, the recent surge in new external debt has increased external vulnerability,
including to shocks relating to exchange rate changes. The authorities noted that because the
bulk of the increase in debt was by the private sector to finance investment, it was of lesser
concern, as it would eventually enhance growth. On the other hand, failure to reverse the
upward inflation trend in the coming months could unravel incomes policy and reduce
confidence, posing a large risk to stability. In particular, a further surge in inflation could
exacerbate exchange rate risks by causing foreign banks to reassess macroeconomic
stability, possibly cutting credit lines. While welcoming the authorities’ willingness to
commit to substantial additional fiscal and monetary tightening to support their choice for
exchange rate policy, staff continued to emphasize the risks of this option.
B. Fiscal Policy
12.
There was broad agreement that the fiscal stance in 2005 needs to be tighter
than in the budget to increase savings, with further consolidation needed in the
medium term. The fiscal stance in 2005 in Serbia is to be tightened further to generate a
surplus. To reduce the current account deficit over time, the staff recommended that a
primary surplus of about 2–2½ percent of GDP would be needed. While the authorities
agreed to primary surpluses in principle, they noted that specific targets would need to be
linked to macroeconomic developments. This will be a challenge in view of the need to
increase capital spending11 and reduce the tax burden over time. In Montenegro, there was
agreement that modest deficits need to be maintained in 2005 and beyond to contain the
external deficit despite pressures to spend the large privatization revenues.
13.
Given the high tax burden, fiscal consolidation needs to rely mainly on
curtailing expenditures and reorienting spending priorities towards supporting
growth. This would also increase flexibility of fiscal policy over time. Savings should focus
on reducing the high levels of non-discretionary spending, while increasing capital spending
over time. In this context, further reforms are necessary, in particular to reduce the size of
the wage bill and restore the financial viability of the pension fund. These will be achieved
by a civil service reform in 2005, major changes in the pension law for 2006 in Serbia, as
well as government employment reduction in the health sector through outsourcing of non-

medical services.12 There was broad agreement that accelerated restructuring and
privatization would also help reduce subsidies. The authorities were reluctant, however, to
commit to more specific medium-term plans for reducing budgetary sector employment and
noted that additional budgetary resources will be required to mitigate the social impact of
structural reforms, particularly for severance payments. In Montenegro, the repeated failure
to implement envisaged employment cuts is reducing the flexibility of fiscal policy. These
reforms should be implemented without delay to create room for the needed capital
spending.
14.
The need for further fiscal consolidation limits the scope for tax cuts in the near
term, while reductions in labor taxes remain a medium-term goal. The increased shift
towards indirect taxes with the VAT is welcome and should enhance efficiency of the tax
system. The authorities emphasized that a further reduction in the tax burden by lowering
direct taxes was important to improve the efficiency of the system, and to raise compliance.
In particular, they noted that reducing labor taxes was important to render SM more
competitive and help create jobs. Staff noted that while a lower tax burden over time is
welcome, it should be consistent with further fiscal consolidation. In particular, a reduction
in labor taxes will need to go hand in hand with pension reform. With respect to 2005, there
seems to be no room for tax cuts and any reduction in specific excise taxes to mitigate the
impact of high international fuel prices should be resisted.
15.
Enforcing fiscal discipline in municipalities is a key medium-term priority.
There was agreement that local budgets have at times undermined the fiscal stance of the
central government. Problems were arising, in particular, from foreign debt financing of
infrastructure projects (about 0.4 percent of GDP in 2005), and the use of surpluses
accumulated in previous years (0.3 percent of GDP in 2004). Against this background, the
authorities were determined to review the legal framework for municipal budgets to reduce
the local authorities’ scope for undermining the central government’s fiscal stance.
16. Further structural reforms in revenue administration and expenditure
management are key for reducing fiscal risks.13 Building on recent achievements in tax
administration reform, tax compliance needs to be improved further, particularly with
respect to socially owned enterprises.14 Implementing performance-oriented program
budgeting, as well as prioritizing foreign-financed public investment projects and

The envisaged pension reform would increase the pension age by 2 years, and shift from quarterly to annual
and to inflation-based indexation. Civil service reform in the army envisages cuts in civilian and army
personnel, and a decompression and employment rationalization in the republican government in 2005. Reform
in the education and health sectors will be undertaken in the medium-term with the World Bank support,

incorporating them into the regular budget will be key to increasing the efficiency and
transparency of public expenditure management. While expected privatization revenues and
past fiscal consolidation will reduce overall financing needs in the near term, the
development of a strategy for debt management, including arrears clearance, can help
address future risks given the high share of external public debt.
C. Monetary, Exchange Rate and Financial Sector Policies
17.
Further monetary tightening will rely on both prudential and monetary policy
measures given the high level of euroization. There was broad agreement that a further
tightening of monetary conditions is needed to support exchange rate policy and reduce
inflation. This will be achieved primarily by increasing the reserve requirements on foreign
currency deposits of enterprises and foreign borrowing of banks, and stepping up the
volume of repo operations. It will need to be complemented by the continued use of
prudential measures, which besides striving to avoid a deterioration in the quality of the
loan portfolio, are also expected to contribute to a slowdown in credit growth.
18. Discussions on exchange rate policy focused on the trade-offs between inflation
and current account targets. To reduce the risks for competitiveness of the authorities’
preference for slower depreciation of the dinar in 2005, the staff pointed to the fact that the
burden of achieving external equilibrium now with this option may well fall largely on
fiscal policy. The rigid structure of public expenditures limits fiscal adjustment in Serbia,
and points to the need for a more flexible exchange rate policy to lower the high current
account deficit. With continued wage pressures despite restructuring, and the political
difficulties associated with large public expenditure cuts, it could be risky to use the
exchange rate to significantly bear down on inflation. Although competitiveness seems
currently adequate15, and risks for the external balance are mitigated by the envisaged large
fiscal tightening and faster structural reform, the staff, while concurring to the slower
depreciation of the dinar in 2005, pointed to the large risks with this option for the current
account. The options for exchange rate policy will be kept under review in light of the
degree of success of the current strategy in lowering inflation and the current account
deficit, and range from a continued stable dinar policy to more flexibility within an inflation
targeting framework.16
19. Restructuring of the banking sector is speeding up. Most of the remaining statecontrolled banks will be offered for sale by end-2005, which should lower state ownership
15

The recent strong export performance suggests price competitiveness may have been improved by
the real depreciation of the REER since 2003, while wage data are mixed. Wages in SM are high by
regional standards, but the recent slowdown in wage growth below productivity may be improving
competitiveness. A selected issues paper elaborates on various competitiveness indicators.

of assets to an estimated fifth of total. This should also spur competition, possibly lowering
the still high spreads in the sector. In Montenegro, bank privatization should also be
accelerated.
20. There was broad agreement on the need to continue to enhance financial
supervision, in particular given the increased vulnerabilities from rapid credit growth.
The growth of euro-indexed loans has increased currency risk of unhedged borrowers,
which is exacerbated by the small share of exporters in the economy. To address these risks,
supervision needs to be enhanced with better monitoring and management of risks, and
further efforts made to strengthen on-site and off-site supervision and eliminate regulatory
forbearance. The authorities emphasized that they are in the process of improving the
quality of supervision, including with respect to the linkages between bank and non-bank
financial sectors to address the risks from connected party lending, large single borrower
exposures, and cross holdings between banks and insurers. A forthcoming FSAP report will
further elaborate on financial sector issues (Box 3 in the accompanying staff report on the
Fifth Review of the EA).
D. Incomes Policy
21. A tight incomes policy will remain key for supporting demand management and
restructuring of state-owned enterprises. While the authorities’ efforts at containing wage
growth in the public sector have recently been successful, and are likely to have produced
some demonstration effect as well, staff pointed to high risks of putting too much emphasis
on incomes policy in achieving disinflation. Wage bill ceilings are difficult to enforce, and
can be circumvented, incomes policy has been difficult to enforce in the past, and the
monitored public enterprises cover only a small share of employment. Notwithstanding
these concerns, incomes policy will remain a key instrument for reducing losses in stateowned enterprises and containing public expenditure growth.
E. Enterprise Restructuring and Privatization
22. Bold acceleration of privatization is undoubtedly the overriding economic policy
challenge. Given the constraints on the current account, growth has to rely on improved
total factor productivity with a better allocation of existing resources. There was broad
agreement on the strategy and actions: restructuring of the state-owned enterprises;
privatizing or liquidating all socially-owned enterprises; and increasing financial discipline.
•

While agreeing on the need to restructure the large public companies, the
authorities noted that this can take up to five years. Business and strategic plans
have been prepared for eight large companies in Serbia that include divestiture of key
non-core activities in 2005, trimming of excess labor, and rationalization of
operations, and their implementation is expected to reduce public employment by
about 10 000 workers this year. More restructuring is envisaged in the coming years.

- 18 -

•

All socially-owned enterprises will be offered for sale by end-2006. This will be a
formidable task considering the resistance from vested interests, in particular, in the
65 large, debt-ridden, and overstaffed conglomerates under restructuring. Selling the
large number of small and medium-sized enterprises with less debt and excess labor
should be easier, as many of them are potentially viable with limited additional
investments by new owners. Unsellable companies will be declared bankrupt to
ensure that all resources are reallocated. In Montenegro, the envisaged sales of hotels
and various utilities are an important step in boosting private sector growth.

•

To speed up restructuring and reduce moral hazard, financial discipline in
publicly owned enterprises needs to be hardened. Measures have been taken to
speed up arrears collection by the energy companies and the budget in Serbia. As a
result, the implied deficits in the state and socially owned companies have started to
improve in 2004,17 with further progress expected in 2005. Direct subsidies will also
be gradually reduced in the large and politically sensitive mining and automobile
sectors.

23.
The investment climate will also need to be improved to attract more local and
foreign investment and reduce inefficiency costs in enterprises. There was agreement on
the need to further streamline administrative regulations and formalities related to the
establishment and functioning of enterprises. Refraining from tariff increases is also
important to increase competition in the economy.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
24.
Macroeconomic imbalances have widened in 2004, putting at risk some of the
earlier achievements. The exchange rate-based stabilization in 2002 helped bring the
hyperinflation down to single digits by late-2003, and started to create a basis for growth.
However, macroeconomic policies have failed to contain aggregate demand. It continues to
surpass supply and spill over to imports, as slow structural reforms have kept too much
labor and capital in uncompetitive activities. As a result, exports have remained at a third of
imports, inflation picked up, and the external deficit widened. External vulnerability has
increased with the recent build-up of new external debt, although private, to finance
imports.
25.
The reduction of the macroeconomic imbalances requires carefully balanced
policies given the persistent structural rigidities in the economy and the increasingly
stark trade-off between inflation and the current account. The recent policy corrections,
consisting of the use of an exchange rate anchor, demand tightening, and acceleration of
structural reforms, are expected to start reversing inflation and the external deficit. The main
burden will fall on fiscal policy to avoid putting at risk the recovery in investments through
17

- 19 -

excessively tight monetary policy, and considering the problems in enforcing incomes
policy. However, the widespread euro-indexation of prices, the rigid structure of public
spending, and the still small share of a competitive private sector in GDP reduce policy
effectiveness and raise risks significantly.
26.
Despite supporting this approach for now, the staff is concerned about a
prolonged use of the exchange rate to anchor inflation in Serbia, given the risks for the
current account deficit. The staff concurs to limiting the pace of dinar depreciation to
reduce inflation conditioned on the envisaged strong fiscal adjustment and the
reinvigoration of structural reforms. Due to the widespread euroization, this policy could
prove effective in anchoring inflationary expectations and securing a reduction in inflation.
However, the attendant real dinar appreciation requires an even larger fiscal tightening than
under a flexible exchange rate policy to prevent a further rise in the current account deficit
and in external debt, which should be avoided. As the record of sustainable fiscal
adjustment and incomes policy implementation in Serbia is rather poor, and structural
reforms can be politically difficult to implement, this strategy carries substantial risks for
the external balance. It may also exacerbate the negative impact of demand management on
economic growth, which may become politically unsustainable over time. In Montenegro,
euroization has successfully contributed to disinflation, but containing the current account
deficit requires tight demand management and faster structural reforms.
27.
Given the high tax burden, further fiscal tightening should come from
expenditure savings. Tax cuts in Serbia should be postponed until the macroeconomic
situation has stabilized. Expenditure savings can be found in subsidies, social transfers, and
the general government wage bill. The envisaged pension reform is welcome in this regard.
While cutting total expenditures, additional resources will be required to support reforms,
notably for redundancy payments, and to modernize infrastructure. Further fiscal adjustment
may be needed if the external deficit fails to improve, including revenue measures if the
envisaged, difficult expenditure cuts are delayed. In Montenegro, plans for tax cuts should
likewise be postponed until the external deficit has been reduced to a sustainable level. The
large expected privatization revenues in 2005 should be saved or used to pay back debt.
28.
Monetary conditions should be tightened in Serbia. Although the deepening of
financial intermediation and the attendant credit boom are welcome for growth and
investment, the pace is unsustainable due to the resulting pressure on the current account
and external debt. In environments of high euroization, monetary policy needs to continue to
rely on both monetary and prudential measures, including reserve requirements on foreign
borrowing by banks, to contain credit growth and reduce excess liquidity.
29.
Recent progress with bank privatization is commendable, but banking
regulation and supervision must be further strengthened. The privatization of all statecontrolled banks, including two large and systemically important banks, should be
completed as soon as possible to reduce prudential risks and increase efficiency in the
sector. The sharp increase in mostly euro-linked credits makes it imperative to strengthen
banking supervision and enforce sound prudential standards more rigorously. In

- 20 -

Montenegro, further progress with bank privatization is needed to consolidate the progress
to date, and the brisk credit growth also calls for continued vigilance in bank supervision.
30.
The imposition of a limit on the wage bill in large state-owned enterprises is
welcomed considering their weak financial discipline. However, as these enterprises
account for only 8 percent of non-agricultural employment, further means for enforcing
financial discipline are needed. In particular, state-owned utilities must cut service to
delinquent customers, and bankruptcy procedures should be initiated in case of prolonged
arrears.
31.
Boldly accelerating privatization and restructuring remains the main economic
challenge. This is key to overcoming the financial indiscipline that underlies many of the
longstanding macroeconomic problems. As the large structural current account deficit
leaves little scope for increasing the low share of investments in GDP, sustained economic
growth will require redeploying labor and existing capital to more productive uses. The
ambitious plan to offer all socially owned enterprises for privatization by end-2006 is
welcome. Moving boldly on privatizing these enterprises, while still pressing ahead with
restructuring and privatization of large state-owned enterprises, offers a realistic way of
ensuring the urgently needed export-driven growth. To meet their ambitious goal for
privatization, the authorities should not hesitate to initiate bankruptcy procedures in the case
of financially troubled enterprises that do not attract investors. In state enterprises, given
significant overstaffing and depleted capital, accelerating labor retrenchment and
restructuring is key to improving financial performance. Early privatization and spin-off of
non-core activities could possibly attract significant new investments and generate
employment.
32.

Serbia and Montenegro is to remain on the 24-month consultation cycle.

APPENDIX I

Technical assistance missions during the past 12 months from FAD, MFD and STA
have contributed significantly to tax administration and treasury management; to the
creation of a market-based financial system; and to improved statistical data provision,
respectively. At this stage of Serbia and Montenegro's reforms, they have primarily
focused on institution-building. The FAD missions reviewed the progress in
modernizing tax administration and establishing treasury system, and recommended
(i) more clearly delineating the tax policy role of different revenue agencies, (ii)
improving taxpayer services and compliance programs based on segmenting the tax
base, (iii) strengthening the Treasury’s organization and developing its core
operations as wells as debt management functions, (iv) reforming the payroll
system and strengthening the quality of personnel records in budget institutions to
eliminate “ghost employment.” The MFD recommendations were key to (i)
developing market-based instruments for monetary operations, (ii) improving
public sector debt management, (iii) providing a clear focus to future work on
enhancing banking supervision practices and (iv) outlining positive directions for
NBS reorganization. The STA missions provided an action plan to improve existing
statistics by (i) developing comprehensive data sources for national accounts, (ii)
applying statistical concepts to organize information on government revenues and
expenditures to develop sound government finance statistics, (iii) strengthening the
coverage of balance of payments transactions in Montenegro, and assisting with the
adoption of compilation methodologies consistent with the recommendations of the
fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual (BPM5), and (iv) introducing
sound classifications in compiling monetary and financial statistics.

APPENDIX II

SERBIA AND MONTENEGRO: STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
In recent years, Serbia and Montenegro (SM) has been successfully upgrading its
statistical system with the assistance of the IMF and other bilateral and multilateral
institutions, but international standards are not yet fully met. Official data for all sectors are,
nonetheless, sufficiently good to support key economic analysis. In many areas, including
monetary and fiscal sectors, internationally accepted reporting standards have been
introduced. However, SM still makes extensive use of definitions that were developed to
accommodate national characteristics and were not updated during the decade when the
country was isolated from international developments. A major impediment to the
compilation and reporting of economic data is the fragmentation of statistical activity
between the two Republics and the State Union, hampering coordination. Except for
monetary statistics for Serbia compiled by the National Bank of Serbia (NBS), SM does not
report data to IMF’s Statistical Department (STA) and does not have a page in International
Financial Statistics (IFS).
2.
In response to the authorities’ requests, the Fund dispatched a series of technical
assistance missions to improve the quality of macroeconomic statistics that would support
policy analysis. In 2001–2003, STA conducted four TA missions: two on monetary and
financial statistics in 2001 and 2002, a multisector statistics mission in 2002, and a balance
of payments mission to Serbia in 2003. In 2004, there was a monetary and financial statistics
mission during April 28–May 14, national accounts mission during September 9–23, and a
balance of payments mission (to Montenegro only) during June 23–July 6. These missions
found that there was a critical need for SM to improve existing statistics by (1) developing
comprehensive data sources for national accounts, (2) applying statistical concepts to
organize information on government revenues and expenditures to develop sound
government finance statistics, (3) strengthening the coverage of balance of payments
transactions, and (4) further improving the classification of bank accounts by economic
sector and by financial instrument in compiling monetary and financial statistics.
A. Real Sector
3.
The primary responsibility for compiling real sector data for the republics is assigned
to the Republic of Serbia Statistical Office (RSSO), and the Republic of Montenegro
Statistical Office (RMSO), while the Serbia and Montenegro Statistical Office (SMSO) is
responsible for compiling real sector data for the union. The SMSO has been compiling
national accounts statistics first for the FRY and subsequently for Serbia and Montenegro
since 1997. Annual current price estimates of GDP by activity or by expenditure are
available for Serbia, for 1997–2003 and for Montenegro for 1997–2002. No quarterly data
are yet disseminated, but the RSSO are compiling on an experimental basis constant price
estimates of GDP by the production approach. The agencies have made commendable efforts
to adopt the System of National Accounts (1993 SNA), but there are problems with the scope
of the accounts and the basis for recording that are not broadly consistent with the
international standards. Overall, the quality of the source data is poor, and the national

- 42 -

APPENDIX II

accounts data sources are in serious need of improvement. The statistical techniques used for
the national accounts compilation also need further improvement, and the statistical agencies
are aware it. These issues are being addressed in a master plan for the improvement of
economic statistics, which was developed with the assistance of EUROSTAT.
4.
One of the major problems of the official statistics is the lack of estimates for the
informal activities, producing up to one half of the value added in the economy. In an attempt
to improve the industrial output index, the statistical office has broadened the coverage of the
index in 2004 to include several hundred small and medium enterprises, but with the
drawback of a reduced reliability of the index and its limited comparability with the data for
previous years. The coverage of labor force statistics is similarly impaired by incomplete
sampling of informal sector activities, resulting in an implausibly high official
unemployment rate of about 30 percent.
5.
The SMSO and the RSSO compile and disseminate, respectively for the union and
Serbia, retail price indices (RPI), consumer price indices (CPI), producer price indices (PPI),
and unit-value price indices for imports and exports. In Montenegro, the RMSO compiles a
RPI and a CPI, while the Institute for Strategic Studies and Prognoses, a nonprofit institution,
also publishes its own series based on surveys of household consumption. While the
frequency and methodology of observation appear adequate, weighting, data storage, and
dissemination could be improved.
B. Balance of Payments
6.
Balance of payments statistics are currently compiled by the NBS and the Central
Bank of Montenegro (CBM). Principal data sources are customs data on merchandise trade
as processed by the FSO and information of foreign exchange transactions provided by banks
and exchange bureaus. These are complemented by data from the Ministry of International
Economic Relations on external grants and loans. The NBS keeps appropriately detailed
records of external debt held by commercial banks, the government and itself. Forthcoming
legislation is expected to expand the responsibilities of the NBS, by charging it with the
recording of leasing transactions and leasing-related debt. While the data compilation
procedures appear appropriate, some components of the balance of payments payments (e.g.
remittances) suffer from substantial underrecording owing to the large proportion of foreign
exchange transactions occurring outside official channels. Since 2001, the NBS has
expended commendable efforts to improve its estimation of actual flows. The NBS could
further improve coverage, valuation and classification by adjusting trade data for transactions
not explicitly declared (e.g., repairs, shuttle trade and grants in kind), and removing
exchange-rate changes from certain financial transactions, including arrears below the line.
In Montenegro, the CBM has recently transferred responsibility for external debt recording
to the Ministry of Finance
7.
At present, the union’s balance of payments statement strives to cover both
constituent states, notably with regard to trade in goods and services, but the compilation of
various items may still suffer from missing or poor information and inconsistent estimates

- 43 -

APPENDIX II

from state sources, notably with regard to the estimation of trade in goods and services
between Serbia and Montenegro. As a consequence, the statement continues to show
significant net errors and omissions. The NBS compiles a balance of payments statement for
Serbia using existing national sources, and the CBM has also begun compiling balance of
payments statistics for Montenegro. However, the coordination of technical work at the state
level needs to be improved in order to lay the basis for accurate union-level statistics,
including with regard to external debt. A balance of payments technical assistance mission to
the CBM in June/July 2004 assisted with adoption of compilation methodologies consistent
with the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual (BPM5) and provided
recommendations to improve international trade and external debt statistics, as well as
Montenegro’s international transaction reporting system (ITRS). Close coordination between
the NBS and the CBM will be needed to compile balance of payments data on a BPM5 basis
for the Union.
C. Government Finance
8.
Fiscal statistics for Serbia are compiled by the Serbian Ministry of Finance and for
Montenegro by the Montenegro Ministry of Finance. Principal data sources are republican
treasuries and the budget execution reports of the spending ministries and first-level budget
units. For Serbia, revenue data are more timely and reliable than expenditure data, and the
information on detailed government operations is available with substantial delays.
Montenegro now reports the republican budget implementation data on monthly basis.
9.
While data on the general government are now compiled, they are not fully compliant
with the Government Finance Statistics Manual (GFSM 2001). Since 2001, the government
of Serbia has made efforts to bring the existing budget reporting system in line with GFS
methodology. But full compliance is still to be achieved as full implementation of the new
chart of accounts, generally consistent with the classifications of the GFSM 2001, has not
been completed.
10.
Fiscal data for the central government of Montenegro are based on the new GFS
classification. However, data for the social security funds, reported directly by the funds with
significant delays, are not compiled on a GFS basis. A new chart of accounts was introduced
in Montenegro in 2001, but still needs to be fully implemented at the local level. SM began
reporting data on general government—including local government—in the 2003 edition of
the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook.
D. Monetary Accounts
11.
Monetary and financial statistics are compiled by the NBS and the CBM, broadly
following the methodology set forth in the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual. After
a break of over a decade, the NBS began reporting to STA monetary statistics for Serbia in
November 2002. The data included monthly data for January 2002–October 2002, annual
data for 1998–2000 and quarterly data for 2001 on analytical accounts of the NBS, other
depository corporations, and the banking system, as well as data on interest rates, compiled

- 44 -

APPENDIX II

according to the recommendations of 2001–02 STA missions on monetary and financial
statistics. In July 2003, the NBS reported annual data going back to 1995. After a hiatus
between December 2003 and July 2004, the NBS resumed its reporting of data to STA in
August 2004. The NBS reported data as of November 2004 in its recent submission. Since
October 2003 the NBS has also begun publishing detailed monetary statistics in a new
monthly Statistical Bulletin, which includes tables on monetary statistics, balance sheets and
surveys for the NBS and the commercial banks. At present, both the NBS and the CBM meet
GDDS recommendations with respect to the periodicity and timeliness of financial sector
data.
12.
The Republic of Serbia introduced new charts of accounts for the NBS and the
commercial banks in December 2003. The Republic of Montenegro also introduced new
charts of accounts for the CBM (January 2004) and for the commercial banks (December
2003). Both republics are now compiling monetary statistics from data collected based on the
new charts of accounts. Despite significant progress, there is still plenty of room for further
improvements. The monetary and financial statistics mission in 2004 made recommendations
to the NBS on methodological issues concerning (1) classification of loan-loss provisions
and treatment of nonoperating banks, (2) uniform treatment of residents/nonresidents and
various domestic sectors (including the government sector); and (3) uniform treatment of
residents of Montenegro as nonresidents across all macroeconomic statistics for the Republic
of Serbia. The mission also made detailed recommendations to the CBM for improving (1)
the classification of financial instruments, including loan-loss provisions and depreciation,
(2) sectorization of government units and funds, and (3) mapping between the charts of
accounts of the CBM and other depository corporations with the respective sectoral balance
sheets. The mission also developed a prototype Depository Corporations Survey for the
CBM to use in reporting data to the IMF.
13.
The Fund is in the process of resuming the publication of a country page in
International Financial Statistics (IFS) for SM. The proposed country page will have a
section for each republic. To facilitate the process, the 2004 monetary and financial statistics
mission reiterated the recommendations of the 2002 multisector statistics mission to
nominate the IFS correspondents and establish a track record of timely and regular reporting
of macroeconomic statistics to STA.

This note updates the debt sustainability analysis in Country Report No. 05/13.
Medium-term balance of payments projections
1.
The baseline scenario assumes that: (a) exports will grow at an annual average of
24 percent in the first three years (starting with 2005) and 14 percent in the following four
years in dollar terms (growth rates in euro terms are similar); (b) imports will grow at about
9 percent in the first years (due to high pent-up demand) but then decline, even though they
remain higher than nominal GDP1; (c) FDI related to the privatization process continues to
flow in during 2005 and 2006, but is gradually replaced by other types of FDI, including
“greenfield” investment, equity investment, and reinvestment in existing companies,
building on the success in privatization and improving the business environment; (d)
commercial borrowing will increase steadily as the business environment improves; (e)
official borrowing will increase moderately, with declining program support being offset by
increasing project support; (f) there will be no IMF support after the current arrangement;
(g) gross international reserves will remain at around 4 months of prospective imports of
goods and services.
2.
Under the baseline scenario, the debt-to-GDP ratio improves over the next 10 years,
averaging around 56 percent in the first 3 years and around 51 percent in the next five years.
Debt service ratios, on the other hand, increase over the time horizon, partly reflecting the
increased debt service after the end of the grace period offered by the Paris Club and other
bilateral creditors, and stabilize at around 10 percent of GDP and 26 percent of exports. The
rise of debt service ratios argues for the maintenance of adequate official reserves to guard
against possible risks, while keeping on schedule with the country’s external obligations.
Both the external debt and debt service ratios, especially those to exports, differ from the
results in Country Report No. 05/13 due to the revision of nominal GDP figures, and to
higher-than-previously-expected commercial borrowings by newly privatized companies
and foreign-owned banks, mostly from their parent companies abroad.

1

The assumptions on export and import growth rates take into consideration the experience of other transitional
economies and the performance of exports and imports of SM since 2000. The rapid growth of imports partly
reflects the large needs for basic investment and consumption goods following the economic isolation of the
country, and is supported by increasing availability of financing. Exports are expected to show sustained growth
in the projection period, reflecting the recovery of the domestic demand of SM’s main trading partners, as well
as the impact of the structural reforms, the domestic and substantial foreign investments in recent years, and the
increasing trade integration with the rest of the world.

APPENDIX III

Stress testing applying the standardized sustainability framework
3.
The standard framework for the debt sustainability analysis has been adapted to the
particular case of Serbia and Montenegro to take into account the limited availability of data
and the exceptional factors that have affected economic performance, as well as data
quality, in the course of the 1990s. The historical averages for most key variables are based
on the outturns of 2000–2004; deflators are based on 2001–2004 to exclude the inflationary
episode following the Kosovo war. Notwithstanding these specificities, this DSA relies
exclusively on country data for the first time for stress testing.2 Results are therefore only
partially comparable with previous DSAs.
4.
If the key variables (real GDP growth, dollar deflator, nominal interest rate, export
and import growth rates, non-interest current account, and non-debt inflows) are set as the
historical averages, as defined above, the external debt ratios would decline faster than in
the baseline case after the first year, owing to the much higher historical GDP deflator
related to to dollar depreciation, and the lower nominal interest rate partly associated with
the delayed start of debt service to the Paris Club creditors.
5.
Sensitivity analysis allows to compare the debt-to-GDP ratios under different
scenarios..The largest increases in the debt-to-GDP ratio are brought about by shocks to the
current account (partly due to the exceptionally high 2004 outcome) and by large one-time
nominal depreciation in 2005 (due to the significant drop in GDP in dollar terms). Shocks to
real growth increase the debt ratio in the medium term, but in the long run the ratio
converges to the baseline. On the other hand, shocks to the interest rate from the historical
average have a positive impact, reflecting the low interest rates in 2002–03. Similarly, as the
dollar deflator in 2000–04 was relatively high, the scenario with shocks to the deflator from
its historical average generates a slightly improved debt ratio relative to the baseline. The
combination of smaller shocks of all the above variables would yield slightly lower debt
ratios than the baseline due to the prevalence of the GDP deflators and interest rate effects.
6.
The DSA also analyzes the impact on debt dynamics of the alternative slow reform
scenario discussed in the main report. Such scenario envisages slower structural reform,
with lower GDP growth, exports, and, to a lesser degree, imports, despite assuming
acceptable macroeconomic policies. FDI would be negatively affected, and financing the
higher current account would increasingly rely on external commercial borrowing. Under
this scenario the debt would follow an explosive path and would be increasingly higher over
time.

2

As explained in Country Report No. 03/151, previous DSAs used data from four countries in the region
(Albania, Bulgaria, Croatia, and Romania) to derive standard deviation; moreover, the historical averages were
based on the outturns of 2002 and 2003.

1/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; ρ = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms, g = real GDP growth rate,
ε = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and α = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock. ρ increases with an appreciating domestic currency (ε > 0) and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ The change in key variables under this scenario is discussed in the text.
7/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels
of the last projection year.
8/ Due to exceptional factors, including the Kosovo war, data from 2000-2004 are used (2001-2004 for GDP deflators). Stress test results are different from DSAs
in previous staff reports which relied on 1996-2001 data from a set of comparable countries.

APPENDIX IV

SERBIA AND MONTENEGRO: PUBLIC SECTOR DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
1.
This appendix updates the public sector DSA in Country Report No. 05/13. Under
the baseline scenario, SM’s debt-to-GDP ratio would decline steadily from 60.2 percent of
GDP in 2004 to 39.2 percent of GDP in 2009 (Table 1). The debt-to-revenue ratio would
decline by 41.9 percentage points over the same period, from 133 percent in 2004. The
result of the baseline scenario is similar to the one presented in Country Report No. 05/13,
with the debt-to-GDP ratio falling more rapidly after 2005 due to higher GDP growth in
2004 and valuation effect. The DSA reflects the London Club debt rescheduling following
successful negotiations in mid-2004. Following a sizeable fiscal improvement in 2004 and
2005, the baseline assumes a more gradual fiscal adjustment from 2006 onwards. Current
primary spending would gradually fall as a share of GDP, but would increase in real terms
over time, even in 2005 where cuts in current spending are large. This medium-term decline
reflects savings from budget sector reform. Notwithstanding some delay in laying off
government workers in 2005, wage bill and employment reform will continue to form an
important component of the medium-term expenditure improvement plan. In addition,
measures will be taken to reduce subsidies to the public enterprises while a high priority
pension reform, to be started later in the year, will help alleviate the burden on the budget.
In particular, significant budgetary savings are expected after the law on pensions is
amended to delink pension benefits from wages and replace quarterly with annual
indexation. Capital spending, which is expected to remain weak in 2005, should pick up in
2006 and thereafter. The primary surplus is projected to improve steadily from 1.2 percent
of GDP in 2004 to 3.8 percent of GDP by 2008 and 2009—this is because the primary
spending is projected to decline faster than the revenue ratio. Privatization receipts are
expected to fall, and be relatively modest, in the coming years (especially when compared
to 2003 and 2004).
2.
Using the standardized methodology set out in Assessing Sustainability, May 28,
2002 (http://www.imf.org/external/np/pdr/sus/2002/eng/052802.htm), but with modifications
due to data constraints, stress tests were conducted. Historical averages for SM were
incomplete prior to 2000. As a result, the 2003–04 outturns were used to replace historical
averages, and the 1997–2001 data for 4 countries in the region Albania, Bulgaria, Croatia
and Romania, were used to derive the standard deviation.
3.
The first stress test keeps real GDP growth rate, real interest rate, and the primary
balance at the 2004 level. This results in somewhat slower reduction in the debt ratio in the
outer years relative to the baseline, but the decline will eventually catch up by 2009, leading
to a net reduction of 20.9 percentage points of GDP from 2004–2009. Other stress tests,
including (i) higher real interest rates, (ii) lower GDP growth, (iii) lower primary balance;
(iv) combination of (i)–(iii); and (v) a 10 percent increase in debt-creating flows would lead
broadly to similar results—a decline in the debt-to-GDP ratio from its 2004 level into the
medium term, but at a generally slower pace compared to the baseline scenario.

- 51 -

APPENDIX IV

4.
The stress test with a real depreciation of 30 percent in 2005 would, however,
increase the 2005 debt ratio by a significant amount; it would decline thereafter in the
medium term, gradually returning to near its starting level at the end of the projection period.

SERBIA AND MONTENEGRO: IMF/WORLD BANK RELATIONS
Partnership with Serbia and Montenegro’s Development Strategy
1.
On May 8, 2001 the World Bank's Board approved the succession of the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) to SFRY's membership in the International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (IBRD). FRY membership in the International
Development Association (IDA) was confirmed on June 11, 2001. Following constitutional
changes, FRY completed its transition to Serbia and Montenegro (SM) on February 4, 2003.
The government of SM and its two constituent republics of Serbia and Montenegro have
highlighted progress in structural reform and stabilization, and outlined their medium-term
development strategies in their respective Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSP). The
Joint Staff Assessment (JSA) of the PRSP was endorsed by the IMF Board on March 2 and
was reviewed by the Bank's Board of Directors on March 16, 2004.
2.
In the context of a program supported by a three-year Extended Arrangement (EA)
the IMF takes the lead on macroeconomic (fiscal, monetary, and exchange rate) policies
aimed at facilitating sustainable growth. In addition to macroeconomic targets, the Fund has
established structural performance criteria and benchmarks in areas such as tax
administration, payments system reform, banking reform, financial markets, foreign trade
policy, and energy tariffs. Working together with bilateral donors, the Fund has also provided
technical assistance in the first three areas.
3.
As outlined more fully below, the Bank has complemented the Fund's work through
its support to structural reforms. In areas of direct interest to the Fund, the Bank leads the
policy dialogue in: (i) public expenditure management; (ii) macroeconomically important
sectoral reforms (e.g. in the energy sector), (iii) pension, health and social assistance reform;
(iv) the restructuring and privatization of enterprises; and (v) legal reforms with a bearing on
the business environment, including labor markets. The Bank and Fund have jointly led the
policy dialogue in the financial sector, including on the restructuring and privatization of
banks, and in foreign trade. The Bank's program of investment lending, is described more
fully below.
World Bank Group Strategy
4.
The first stage of World Bank assistance commenced even before SM's membership.
In view of its urgent needs, and concurrent with the arrears clearance process, the Bank
established in May 2001 a Trust Fund for FRY (TFFRY) using US$30 million of IBRD
surplus net income to provide grant financing for selected priority activities. Five grants
totaling US$30 million were approved under the TFFRY. These grants, which were
important in laying the foundations for the IDA-financed program, included (i) a private
sector technical assistance grant for Serbia, (ii) a financial sector technical assistance grant
for Serbia, (iii) a social protection grant for Serbia; (iv) an electric power emergency
reconstruction grant for Serbia, and (v) an environmental infrastructure grant for
Montenegro.

- 54 -

APPENDIX V

5.
The second stage of assistance began on May 8, 2001, when the Bank's Board of
Directors endorsed a first Transitional Support Strategy (TSS) for SM.
1
6.
The TSS contained a three-year IDA envelope of up to US$540 million for SM on a
temporary and exceptional basis, with actual lending to depend upon performance against
agreed benchmarks. It was envisaged that up to 80 percent of the program could support
policy-based lending. A first year program of lending, economic and sector work and
technical assistance was outlined. The Transitional Support Strategy Update, discussed by
the Bank's Board on August 8, 2002, confirmed the overall approach (including the focus on
policy-based lending), and laid out the Bank's program for FY03. A second TSS Update,
covering FY04, was endorsed by the Bank's Board on March 16, 2004.

7.
A Joint World Bank-IFC Country Assistance Strategy covering FY05–07 was
endorsed by the Bank’s Board of Directors on December 16, 2004. The CAS has three goals:
(i) creating a smaller, more sustainable and more efficient public sector; (ii) creating a larger,
more dynamic private sector; and (iii) reducing poverty levels and improving social
protection and access to public services.
8.
Given the extensive de jure and de facto devolution of responsibility for economic
policy to the member state level, the program of adjustment lending is focused at the republic
level. To date, seven operations have been approved. In Serbia, a multi-sectoral Structural
Adjustment Credit (SAC-approved in January 2002) was designed to enhance fiscal
sustainability through reforms of public expenditure management, the energy sector, social
protection, labor markets, and health care. A Social Sector Adjustment Credit (approved in
April 2003), supported further reforms in pensions, health and labor, while enhancing the
focus on social assistance and poverty monitoring. Two Private and Financial Sector
Adjustment Credits (PFSAC I and II, approved May 2002 and June 2003 respectively) focus
on the growth promotion agenda, assisting the government in: (i) strengthening the financial
system through the liquidation of troubled banks and an improved policy and regulatory
environment; (ii) privatizing and restructuring socially-owned enterprises; and (iii)
improving the investment and business climate., A second (single tranche) multisectoral SAC
for Serbia was approved in December 2004. It’s focus centers on improving the business
environment, further rehabilitating the energy sector, enhancing social protection and
fostering stronger public administration. In Montenegro, the first multi-sectoral Structural
Adjustment Credit, approved in August 2002 supported reforms critical to fiscal
sustainability as well as economic growth in the areas of public expenditure management,
pensions, energy, labor markets, and the business environment. A second (two tranche)
multi-sectoral SAC for Montenegro was approved by the Board on September 14, 2004. It

1

A plan to clear SM’s arrears to the World Bank was approved with the membership packages that provided for
the exceptional consolidation of SM's arrears and principal not yet due into a new package of IBRD loans.
These Consolidation Loans were approved by the Board on December 13, 2001, and became effective in early
January 2002.

- 55 -

APPENDIX V

focuses on enhancing growth potential, including reforms to the financial, energy, pension,
health and public administration sectors.
9.
The Bank's program of adjustment lending has been underpinned by analytical
studies. In June 2001, the Bank, working together with the European Commission and the
federal and republican governments, completed an Economic Recovery and Transition
Program (ERTP), which was presented to the Donor Conference held the same month.2
In 2002, the Bank focused on three complementary studies which covered both republics—a
Public Expenditure and Institutional Review (PEIR), a Country Financial Accountability
Assessment (CFAA), and a Country Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR). Studies of
the agricultural (Serbia) and environmental sectors (both republics) were also completed. The
Bank supports an ongoing program on improving the monitoring and analysis of poverty.
Poverty Household Surveys for both republics laid the foundations for a Poverty Assessment,
completed in 2003. The Bank recently finalized an Economic Memorandum for Serbia
focusing on the agenda for sustained growth and employment creation. An Economic
Memorandum for Montenegro has been initiated for delivery this fiscal year.
10.
In both republics, a program of selective investment lending has been designed to
assist the authorities to tackle critical impediments to effective public sector management and
private sector development, improve social policy and underpin reforms initiated under the
Bank-supported adjustment programs. A Trade and Transport Facility for Southeast Europe
and an Export Finance project have been approved which cover both Serbia and
Montenegro's needs. In addition, in Serbia IDA is supporting an Education project, an
Enterprise and Bank Restructuring Technical Assistance operation, an Energy Efficiency
project , a Health Reform operation, an Employment Promotion Learning and Innovation
project, a Transport Rehabilitation project, and a Real Property Registration and Cadastre
project. In Montenegro, an education reform project was recently approved on March 31,
2005. The Bank also supports an Environmental Improvement project an Energy Learning
and Innovation Credit, a Pension System Administration and Improvement Project and a
Health Reform project. As of end-April 2005, 21 IDA credits totaling US$ 590 million had
been approved for SM, with adjustment support comprising the majority
IFC
11.
SM is a major IFC priority in South East Europe. During FY02–03 IFC committed
about US$43 million in 5 projects, three in financial markets and two in manufacturing.
Donor supported technical assistance (TA) has been an important component of the IFC
strategy to develop a pipeline of potential investments in SM. During the last two years IFC
has mobilized about US$4 million of trust fund resources for technical assistance conducting

APPENDIX V

more than twenty assignments on institutional strengthening in the financial sector and on
project preparation in the real sector.
12.
IFC has contributed to strong foreign strategic investor interest in the financial sector
and to establishing viable financial institutions. IFC supported the first Microfinance Bank
and the establishment of RaiffeisenBank in the country. In Montenegro, IFC approved an
investment in Opportunity Bank Montenegro for a line of credit of up to Euro4 million to
fund micro-enterprise and SME lending. IFC is supporting the restructuring and privatization
of Udruzena Vojvodjanska Bank (UVB) successor banks. Also, the recent agreement
between IFC and the Government of Montenegro on the restructuring of IFC’s claims on
Montenegrin enterprises and banks, should pave the way for additional IFC restructuring and
privatization support in the financial sector. IFC’s Southeast Europe Enterprise Development
facility (SEED) has provided extensive assistance to the institutional development of leasing
market and to overall SME sector development. IFC has provided extensive due diligence to
the Serbian Insurance Supervisor and has conducted a preliminary due diligence on the
restructuring and privatization of Dunav Insurance Company.
13.
In the corporate sector, IFC has achieved good results investing Euro20 million in
Tigar Michelin Holding, a leading regional producer of high quality car tires. The financing
was accompanied by extensive technical assistance to the company and its suppliers,
supported by SEED linkages program, resulting in high development impact. IFC is
providing an innovative technical assistance program to Elektronska Industrija, a Serbian
manufacturer of consumer electronic products and home appliances, to help the company
with pre-privatization restructuring and to facilitate the joint ventures and/or direct sales to
foreign investors.
14.
In tandem with the Bank’s program of support, IFC is committed to supporting the
restructuring and preparation for privatization of the infrastructure sector, as well as
facilitating private sector participation in the sector. Through its Balkans Infrastructure
Development Facility (BIDFacility), IFC will help public sector entities in the South East
Europe region, including Serbia and Montenegro, to attract private sector participation and
investments in infrastructure, primarily in the energy, transport and water and sanitation
sectors. IFC focus will be to explore, facilitate, and support public-private partnership (PPP)
opportunities, particularly in solid waste and water management services (city of Belgrade),
oil and gas transport and distribution, and the power cogeneration sector. In the area of
information and communication technology, IFC will explore investment opportunities in the
sector. In the energy sector, IFC has been active supporting an advisory assignment to
prepare a restructuring and privatization strategy of the Serbian oil company Naftna
Industrija Srbije (NIS), as well as launching a Power Cogeneration study to survey the
market potential and identify opportunities for private sector participation and PPP.
15.
Though foreign investors’ country risk appetite remains modest, opportunities for
new IFC investment projects are being actively pursued in both the financial and
manufacturing sectors. IFC’s program development, however, depends on further
implementation of the Governments reform agenda, the creation of a favorable business

- 57 -

APPENDIX V

climate, and the acceleration of the privatization process. While in the short term IFC will
continue to expand its activities in general manufacturing and the financial sectors, in the
longer term IFC will look for opportunities to support Serbia and Montenegro with
investments in the energy and telecommunication sectors, as well as in the infrastructure
sector.
MIGA
16.
As of November 30, 2004, MIGA’s outstanding guarantee portfolio in SM consisted
of 15 guarantee contracts: 13 in the financial sector, one in the services sector, and one in the
manufacturing sector, with a total gross exposure of US$344.2 million and a total net
exposure of US$170.6 million. At 6.3 percent of MIGA's total gross exposure, SM is now
MIGA's fourth largest host country. MIGA also provides TA (institutional development and
capacity building) on investment promotion to both Serbia and Montenegro. An initial
project benefiting the Serbia Investment and Export Promotion Agency (SIEPA) is nearing
completion. A comprehensive follow-on project with a two- to three-year time horizon is
expected to be launched in early 2005; this project will be implemented by MIGA on behalf
of the EAR. In Montenegro, also with financial support from the EAR, MIGA is currently
implementing an initial capacity building project in support of the new Montenegrin
Investment Promotion Agency. MIGA’s TA activities in SM are feeding into a new, regional
FDI outreach and marketing initiative for the Western Balkans which MIGA launched in
summer 2004 (that is, the European Investor Outreach Program for the Western Balkans).
Joint Staff Assessment (JSA) of the Poverty Reduction Strategies
17.
Bank and Fund staff produced a joint assessment of the authorities' poverty reduction
strategies as proposed in the PRSP of each republic. Bank staff took the lead in evaluating
the structural measures to underpin poverty reduction, while Fund staff assessed the
macroeconomic framework underlying the strategies. The JSA enumerates the strengths of
the envisioned poverty reduction strategies, notably the focus on harmonization to common
EU standards, continuing privatization, an improved business environment, and policies to
raise employment. However, staff also found that the reports could usefully have relied on
less optimistic assumptions regarding domestic savings, foreign financing inflows and the
financing of poverty reduction programs, addressed crime and governance more directly, and
provided a sharper sense of prioritization among possible projects. Staff agreed that the
envisioned market-oriented reforms, if implemented in the context of continuing
macroeconomic stability, will foster a considerable reduction in poverty.
Bank-Fund Collaboration in Specific Areas
18.
As part of its overall assistance to SM, the Bank combines lending, analytical work
and technical assistance to support policy reforms, with a focus on the following areas:
19.
Public expenditure management. SM's weak systems of public financial
management had long contributed to macroeconomic instability, a lack of transparency, and

- 58 -

APPENDIX V

the inefficient use of public resources, requiring reforms and institution building in this area.
The Bank is taking the lead with a multi-pronged assistance program, which the Fund is
complementing with policy conditionality and technical assistance. The Bank's program
began with the completion in 2002 of the PEIR, CFAA, and CPAR (see above), which in
turn helped to define significant public expenditure management components in the first
SACs for Serbia and Montenegro. In Serbia, key reforms supported by the Bank included the
adoption of the Law on the Budget System (Organic Budget Law), the first steps toward
introducing a treasury system, and enhanced inspection, auditing and procurement
procedures. In Montenegro, where legal and institutional reforms had reached a more
advanced stage, key reforms include the establishment of a more comprehensive multi-year
framework for budget preparation, continued implementation of the interim treasury system,
and improvements in the internal audit. Care is being taken to ensure consistency of the
PRSP with available budgetary resources.
20.
Energy sector reform. The combination of low power prices and collection rates, a
decade of underinvestment and lack of maintenance, and war-related physical damage, led to
power shortages and left SM with loss-making and inefficient electric utilities. As the largest
single source of quasi-fiscal pressures, the power sector became an area of particularly close
collaboration between the Bank and the Fund. While the Bank has taken the lead in
developing the policy agenda, the sector's fiscal impact has also motivated limited but strong
conditionality in successive Fund arrangements. The Bank program has combined support
for policy reforms with investment credits/grants for critical needs in both Serbia and
Montenegro, improved financial management and technical assistance. The SACs for both
republics focused on improving the financial position of the republican power utilities
through measures to enhance revenues (phased tariff increases and improved collections) or
reduce operating costs (e.g. control of the wage bill). Progress in achieving tariff rate targets
is being monitored closely both by the Bank and the Fund. In parallel, the electric power
emergency reconstruction grant for Serbia under the TFFRY supported urgent repairs,
improvements in the financial management of the electric power company, and legal and
policy advisory services. The Bank provides continuing support to the sector in Serbia with
an Energy Efficiency Credit and complementary Global Environmental Fund grant, now
under preparation. The already approved Montenegro Energy Sector Learning and
Innovation Credit will introduce automated billing and demand management, facilitate the
eventual privatization of distribution services and lay the basis for institutional strengthening.
21.
Pension, health and social assistance reform. The state pension systems of both
Serbia and Montenegro account for about one-third of consolidated public spending, and
pension spending as a share of GDP is high by regional standards. Chronic arrears on
pension payments and large budgetary transfers to the pension funds in both republics were
further evidence that reforms were required to improve pension system financial balance and
overall medium-term fiscal sustainability. This created a synergy between Bank and Fund
programs. The Bank has taken the lead, including initial pension reforms in its adjustment
operations in both republics, and providing required technical assistance through the social
protection grant under the TFFRY. The key elements of pension reforms were parametric

- 59 -

APPENDIX V

adjustments to retirement ages and indexation rules which would bring immediate fiscal
savings relative to the no reform scenario. The Fund has provided supporting fiscal analysis
and included related structural benchmarks in its successive arrangements in SM. The
SOSAC for Serbia supported the next reforms of the pay-as-you-go system, as well as
preparatory steps for a more comprehensive revamping of the pension system. A Pension
Systems Administration Improvement Project was approved for Montenegro and work has
commenced on a pension reform technical assistance operation for Serbia for this fiscal year
delivery.
22.
Serbia’s SAC also included initial reforms of the health care system to begin
restoring fiscal balance in that sector, as a basis for improving its functioning and ability to
provide basic health care services for all citizens. To this end, the SAC supported the
introduction of modest co-payments, adoption of a more limited essential drugs list, the
addressing of structural inefficiencies in the delivery system, and the laying of foundations
for a new policy and legal framework. The SOSAC deepened this reform agenda. The Bank's
involvement in the health care sector in Montenegro has focused on analytical work, most
recently under the PEIR and a health sector reform project was approved in June 2004.
23.
In Serbia, the Bank's work on reforming other components of the social safety net
began with conditionality and technical assistance under the social protection grant under the
TFFRY. The SAC supported pilot reforms to enhance the equity and coverage of the main
program of social assistance (the so-called Material Assistance to Families), to improve the
management of donor funds for such programs, and to begin development of a new Law on
Employment regulating benefits for unemployed workers. These reforms were completed
and deepened under the SOSAC. The SAC for Montenegro also supported the enactment of a
Law on Labor and Law on Employment.
24.
Restructuring and privatization of enterprises and banks. Beginning in late 2000
in Serbia, and earlier in Montenegro, SM has been engaged in far-reaching reforms of the
enterprise and financial sector. In Serbia, the initial focus in the enterprise sector was on
creating a transparent legal and institutional framework for privatization to attract strategic
investors. The agenda in the banking sector focused on the need to address the deep
insolvency of the banking sector in a permanent and fiscally responsible fashion. The Bank
and the Fund have worked closely together to support the needed policy reforms, with the
Bank taking the lead on the enterprise sector and sharing leadership in the banking sector.
The Bank program has combined sectoral adjustment credits focused on these themes with
parallel projects to provide technical assistance. The Bank has worked closely with the Fund
to formulate the benchmarks in PFSAC I and II which complement and reinforce the
elements of the EA related to financial sector strengthening. Fund conditionality under the
EA has focused on facilitating rapid privatization, ensuring that all privatization proceeds
flow transparently through the budget, and putting in place control mechanisms in banks
prior to their privatization. Under the TFFRY, the Bank provided early support through
private and financial sector technical assistance grants. This work is continued under the
Privatization and Restructuring of Banks and Enterprises Technical Assistance Project. The

- 60 -

APPENDIX V

Bank has increased its involvement in these areas in Montenegro under the recently approved
second SAC for Montenegro.
25.
Legal reforms with a bearing on the business environment. The Bank has taken
the lead on business environment and general private sector development. The SAC for
Montenegro supported the adoption and initial implementation of the enterprise law,
bankruptcy law, and law on secured transactions. The PFSAC for Serbia supported
enactment of laws on foreign direct investment and an SME agency, amendments to federal
and republican enterprise laws, and preparation of a law on secured transactions. The PFSAC
II followed up by supporting the enactment of laws on concessions, leasing, bankruptcy,
business registration, and on Agency for Business Services. In addition, the SACs in both
republics emphasized reforms of the legal framework for the labor market, promoting
employment creation through greater flexibility, and promoting the financial sustainability
and effectiveness of unemployment benefit programs. This complements Fund
conditionalities related to securities and accounting legislation, and rationalizing
employment clauses in social programs associated with privatization and enterprise
restructuring. In FY02, the Bank prepared an initial diagnostic study of Serbia's legal and
judicial framework. A small grant extended to the Government of Serbia supports the
improvements in Serbia’s court administration and the development of a National Judicial
Reform Strategy.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
This report focuses on the fifth review under the EA. The Article IV consultation
discussions are the subject of a separate report.
2.
Program implementation has been mixed (Appendix III, Annexes A–B). While all
but one end-March quantitative PCs were met, important structural performance criteria related
to downsizing of the army and restructuring in the energy sector were missed. Several
benchmarks were also met with some delay, but program implementation has overall improved
from the last review. The discussions on the fifth review took longer than expected because of
differing views on the amount of fiscal and monetary policy tightening needed to deal with the
rising inflation and external imbalance.
3.
The political situation remains fragile implying large policy implementation risks,
although recent advances with EU accession have strengthened the reform momentum. In
Serbia, while the minority government’s position was recently boosted by a positive Feasibility
Study—a first step towards EU accession—the political agenda continues to predominate over
economic issues. Uncertainties regarding Kosovo and the union between Serbia and
Montenegro remain, although prospects for international cooperation were enhanced by
improved collaboration with the International Criminal Tribunal in The Hague. In Montenegro,
pro-independence sentiment may result in a referendum in early 2006 on the separation of the
two republics.
II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
4.
Macroeconomic risks in early 2005 continue to be high. Although recent data point
to a potential leveling of the rising inflation and current account trends, their reversal remains
uncertain, and the external debt remains high (Tables 1–2, Figures 1–2).

Although growth has slowed from last year’s record pace, it continues to be led by
strong domestic demand. Despite a marked deceleration in real wage growth since
mid-2004, demand has been sustained by a continuing credit boom and solid inflows of
remittances. It continues to exceed the still limited competitive domestic supply,
contributing to the large macroeconomic imbalances. There are signs of a shift from
consumption to investment demand towards end-2004, as indicated by the surge in
capital goods’ imports and increase in the share of credit to enterprises (Box 1). Output
dropped slightly in early 2005 due to stockpiling at end-2004, but is expected to pick
up with continued export growth and investment in privatized companies. The VAT
introduction in January complicates the analysis because of a one-off shift of imports,
external borrowing, and output from 2005 to end-2004 (Box 2).

•

Inflation in early 2005 surged beyond program targets, reflecting continued
demand pressures and hikes in administered prices. Annual inflation exceeded
17 percent in May, boosted by oil and municipal price increases, the VAT introduction,
and dinar depreciation. The

•

The excess demand widened the current account deficit to 15½ percent of GDP in
2004—an unsustainable level despite some improvement in early 2005. Imports
rose by 7 percent of GDP in 2004, reaching half of GDP, while exports, despite an
increasing trend since mid-2004, remained at a third of that level—reflecting the still
small share of a competitive private sector in the economy. While the VAT effect

Box 1. Indicators of Growth in Serbia
After a disappointing performance in 2002-03, real GDP growth picked up strongly in
2004, and various indicators suggest that competitive supply may be gradually
increasing. This is evidenced, for example, by robust growth of industrial production
(7.2 percent), especially in manufacturing; and soaring exports of goods and of services.
There may also be a shift from consumption to investment, as production of capital goods
and intermediate goods was particularly strong in 2004.

However, much of the growth is still explained by strong domestic demand. Real
consumption grew by 14 percent while investment soared by 20 percent in 2004. On the
consumption side, retail sales, sales of agricultural, forestry, and fishing products, and
consumer goods imports all grew strongly in real terms. This was sustained mostly by a
boom in consumer credit, which grew by 71 percent in real terms, as real wage growth
slowed to 10.1 percent on average over the year. On the investment side, imports of capital
goods and credit to enterprises soared, but construction activity remained subdued, albeit
on the upside.

-7-

Box 2: Macroeconomic Impact of the Introduction of the VAT in Serbia
The value-added tax (VAT) was introduced in January 2005 in Serbia with a normal rate of
18 percent and a reduced rate of 8 percent. It replaced a 20 percent retail sales tax on goods and
services that excluded many agriculture, food, and health products, and computers. Thus, the taxable
VAT base is broader than the retail sales tax; moreover, as with most VATs, capital goods are taxed
but can be deducted along with other taxed inputs, although with a lag.
The VAT had a significant macroeconomic impact on economic activity during the last
quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005, as firms and households brought forward their
consumption and investment plans in anticipation of the VAT. The available data suggest that
purchases of final consumption goods, intermediate goods, and capital goods becoming taxed under
the VAT accelerated significantly during Q4 of 2004. This, in turn, led to an acceleration in both
imports and domestic production, a rise in inventories, and additional domestic and external
borrowing. This may have been compounded by the belief that the overall price level would increase
with the VAT. Subsequently, demand dropped in the first quarter of 2005, resulting in low imports
and a drop in domestic industrial production and inventories. Correcting for this VAT effect,
industrial production would have remained steady in 2005 (see Text Figures).
The staff estimated the size of the VAT effect on the current account at about 1¾ percent of
GDP in 2004 and 2005. Specifically, about $700 million in imports and $300 million in remittances
were brought forward into 2004, increasing the current account deficit that year and lowering it in
2005. External debt may also have been affected by an increase in borrowing needed to finance the
exceptionally high imports, even though the net effect is difficult to estimate.
Imports and industrial production shot up in Q4
2004, before dropping in Q1 2005, largely due to
the VAT.

The VAT also had a one-off effect on prices in January-February, contributing some percentage
points to the RPI. Price increases for newly-taxed goods and services were, to some extent, offset by
price reductions for electricity and oil derivatives, which saw their tax rates decline from 20 percent
to 18 percent. The indirect effects, for example incorporated in some municipal price increases, are
more difficult to quantify.

of the external debt dynamics is of concern.2 As a result, total external debt at end-2004
at US$14 billion (62 percent of GDP) was unchanged despite the debt reduction by the
London Club and other creditors.3 The vulnerability is exacerbated by the prevalence of
euro-indexed lending that transfers exchange rate risk to often unhedged borrowers.
The large capital inflows boosted gross foreign reserves of the National Bank of Serbia
(NBS) to $4.3 billion at end-December 2004 (3.7 months of projected imports), and the
trend has continued in early 2005 with a strong inflow of FDI.

5.
The tightening of macroeconomic policies since mid-2004 has been insufficient to
reduce the imbalances in the face of a lending boom and widespread euro-indexation of
prices:

The fiscal deficit was well below its target in 2004 as the strong economy and
improved collections boosted revenues (Tables 6–8). The overall fiscal position

budget in 2004. Despite tax cuts in both Serbia and Montenegro,4 revenues exceeded
projections (by 2 percent of GDP) as collection improved and growth was stronger than
expected. Expenditures were kept in line with the revised budget. In Montenegro, the
fiscal deficit declined by about 1½ percent of its GDP, slightly better than programmed,
as expenditure was compressed to compensate for larger-than-expected revenue losses
following the recent tax cuts.

However, monetary policy was unable to contain the credit boom that fuelled the
excess demand (Table 9). The improved access to credit by households and enterprises
reduced the need to save, and unleashed strong pent-up demand as newly established
foreign banks competed for market share. Much of it was spent on imports putting
pressure on the current account.

The strict incomes policy in the public sector helped contain wage growth and
facilitated downsizing. This may even have helped to limit wage demands more
broadly, as the public sector has for a long time been considered a trend setter in wage
policy. In Serbia, employment in the 8 monitored state enterprises5 was reduced by
several thousand people in early 2005, thereby helping to keep the wage bill growth in
line with the 7 percent annual program target. In Montenegro, public employment was
reduced by 3.8 percent as of March 2005, about a third of the bi-annual target.

In Serbia, the corporate tax rate was cut from 14 percent to 10 percent in 2004; and the wage bill tax was
eliminated. In Montenegro, the corporate tax was halved to 9 percent as of 2006, and personal income and social
contribution taxes were reduced from 47 to 42 percent in two steps.

January has so far had a modest impact on monetary conditions in an environment of
high and increasing euroization, e.g. euro-liabilities reached 70 percent of total deposits
in 2004, the highest share ever in transition countries.6
•

The impact of exchange rate policy, used over time intermittently to lower
inflation or the external deficit, continues to be weakened by the severe structural
rigidities in the economy (Figure 4). The faster depreciation of the dinar in 2004,
aimed at lowering the current account deficit, contributed to higher inflation, influenced
by the widespread euro-indexation of prices and euroization of assets and liabilities.

the history of
hyperinflation, the authorities considered inflation as the main short-term risk for
stability, and insisted in January on using the exchange rate to anchor expectations. The
slower depreciation of the dinar since in early 2005 seems to have contributed to
disinflation, and the continued growth of exports suggests that competitiveness is
adequate, which points to the structural nature of the external imbalance.7 However, the
risks for the current account have increased, putting a higher burden on fiscal and
incomes policies in containing demand.

•

Although structural reforms have picked up recently, excessive resources are still
locked in uncompetitive activities, putting too much burden on demand
management to lower the external imbalance. The slow structural change has left
SM lagging behind its neighbors in transition (it scored a regional low on the EBRD
transition index), and in the share of labor (20 percent of labor) still employed in
inefficient public and socially owned companies. Nevertheless, reforms have recently
accelerated. Institutional changes required for faster privatization and restructuring
advanced towards end-2004 in Serbia. Regulations for bankruptcy were adopted,
tenders and auctions of socially owned enterprises accelerated since October 2004 with
close to 300 companies offered for sale, of which about 40 percent found buyers, and

bank privatization advanced on schedule. In Montenegro, privatization picked up with
the recent sale of the telecommunications company and other entities.
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
6.
Discussions focused on measures needed to reverse inflation, and the persistently
large, and increasingly debt-financed, current account deficit. The three-year program has
so far failed to achieve its key macroeconomic targets (Figure 5). Its extension until end-year
provides an opportunity to restore macroeconomic stability with a strong policy package.
•

The program will be based on an exchange rate anchor, as the authorities saw
inflation as the main threat to confidence in the near term. At the same time, they
considered the current account deficit, while large, to be more of a medium-term risk,
as financing continues to be available from private and multilateral banks, FDI is rising,
short-term debt remains low, and international reserves continue to increase.
Furthermore, in their view, using the exchange rate to improve the external balance
would only lead to a depreciation-inflation spiral, because of the widespread
euroization, and the structural nature of the current account deficit.

•

Staff underlined that to reduce the risks of this strategy for the external balance, a
further tightening of fiscal and monetary policies is needed. This is risky given the
rigid structure of public spending and past reliance on revenues in deficit reduction, and
the limits set to monetary policy by euroization. To ensure that the fiscal stance is put
on a more sustainable footing, it is essential to include more sustainable expenditure
cuts in the 2006 budget. A more stable exchange rate may also increase balance sheet
risks, if borrowers underestimate foreign exchange risk. This calls for tighter
supervision and prudential rules. Structural reforms also need to be accelerated to
reduce medium-term current account risks by improving the supply response of the
domestic economy.

•

Against this background, understandings were reached to complement the slower
dinar depreciation favored by the authorities, with (i) tighter-than-previouslyprogrammed fiscal policies in 2005; (ii) further monetary tightening to contain credit
growth; and (iii) the acceleration of the structural reform agenda, including the
reduction of quasi-fiscal losses in public enterprises. These are supported by
substantially strengthened program conditionality including four prior actions for the
completion of the review, eight new structural PCs, two new quantitative indicative
targets, and 17 structural benchmarks (for details see paragraph 21, and Annex C in
Appendix III).

- 12 -

A. Macroeconomic Framework
7.
Macroeconomic performance is expected to improve, as agreed policies aimed at
reducing domestic demand take effect, but risks remain (¶12).8 Reducing inflation and
containing the current account deficit while supporting sustainable growth are the key
economic objectives for 2005 and beyond (Table 10, Figure 6):
•

Growth is projected to recede to 4½–5 percent in 2005, reflecting decelerating
demand growth and weaker agricultural output after last year’s bumper crop.
Growth in industry and services in 2005 is expected to remain robust, fueled by strong,
albeit moderating consumption and investment demand. Growth is projected to reach
5 percent on average in subsequent years as privatization and enterprise restructuring
continue and FDI inflows increase.

•

Inflation in Serbia is expected to decline to about 13 percent by end-2005, as
demand pressures subside, exchange rate expectations adapt, and tight incomes
policies in the public sector take hold. However, the authorities project a 10 percent
end-year inflation in Serbia, as they expect a stronger impact on prices from the
tightening of policies. Pressures from oil and administrative prices are a major risk for
the target. In Montenegro, inflation is expected to remain at 3½ percent by end-year.

•

The current account deficit is projected to drop to about 11 percent of GDP in
2005 as demand pressures subside and export growth continues. The underlying
deficit (corrected for the VAT effect) should be reduced from 13.7 percent to
12.6 percent of GDP, broadly in line with the program. The current account deficit is
projected to decline in the medium term, as structural reforms elicit a supply response
and prudent policies strengthen competitiveness. The external debt/GDP ratio is
expected to move gradually towards 52-54 percent of GDP in the medium-term. The
capacity to repay the Fund is expected to remain comfortable (Table 11). However, the
scenario and the debt dynamics are subject to large risks from policy slippages or
external shocks.9

8.
The program targets are subject to large downside risks, despite the strengthened
policies. These stem mainly from (i) the high uncertainty of the impact of monetary measures
on credit growth as an increasing number of new foreign banks compete to gain market share;
(ii) continued growth in direct foreign borrowing; (iii) developments in international oil prices,
in addition to the underlying pressure to align energy tariffs to cover current and investment
costs; (iv) the still fragile political situation, which carries high implementation risks, in

particular, for policies in the fiscal and structural areas affecting employment or incomes under
the program. The authorities stated their readiness to take appropriate measures, should key
macroeconomic indicators show signs of deterioration.
B. Fiscal and Incomes Policy
9.
The fiscal stance in 2005 will be tightened beyond program targets, although the
quality of the additional adjustment remains weak (¶14–24).10 The consolidated general
government is projected to achieve a surplus of 1.2 percent of GDP against a programmed
deficit of 0.8 percent of GDP––a 1.5 percent of GDP improvement relative to the 2004
outcome. This is to be achieved by (i) expenditure cuts already incorporated in the 2005
budget;11 (ii) stronger-than-expected revenue collection (on account of good VAT
performance) and improvements in tax collection;12 and (iii) additional reductions in various
expenditure outlays. While this would result in a decline of both revenues and expenditures
relative to GDP compared to the 2004 outcome, only part of the changes are permanent cuts in
spending, which reduces the quality and sustainability of the proposed adjustment. The high
share of non-discretionary outlays in the budget reduces the scope for more permanent cuts in
programs in the short run.

The fiscal stance for the 2006 budget will be discussed in September 2005 and will take into account
macroeconomic developments.

11

These largely relate to subsidies, in line with the policy of steadily reducing budget support to inefficient
enterprises and agricultural support, and goods and services such as travel, office supplies, and rent.
12

1.5

This is supported by various tax administrative measures initiated in 2004 including the confiscation of bank
accounts of delinquent tax payers, and use of a cash registry that have a more permanent impact on collection
rates.

- 14 -

10.
The quality of adjustment will be improved in 2006, as various expenditure
reforms take hold. Cuts in permanent spending amounting to about 1 percent of GDP will be
achieved mostly through pension reform and lower subsidies as enterprises restructuring
advances (¶16).
11.
The continued strong economy and successful introduction of the VAT are
expected to keep revenues strong in 2005, well above budget targets (¶15). Despite
projected revenue losses from cuts in direct taxes in line with the 2005 budget,13 the carry-over
from the strong economy last year and the successful introduction of the VAT in January have
contributed to buoyant revenues through May this year. Coupled with improved collection, this
is expected to maintain revenues at 44.8 percent of GDP this year. However, the projections
carry down-side risks, which the authorities agreed to address by a set of contingency measures
(¶19). The staff also advised against further tax cuts and tax exemptions this year, emphasizing
the importance of predictability in tax policy.
12.
Expenditures would be cut more than budgeted to support the envisaged
tightening and deal with policy slippages in civil service reform. As a result, the share of
expenditures in GDP would remain in line with the previous 2005 program. Spending will be
curtailed in various categories involving current and capital outlays, beyond the cuts in
subsidies and the wage bill already included in the budget. To compensate for the slower-thanenvisaged civil service reform (¶17), and for the higher-than-projected transfers to the social
funds from unexpected hikes in inflation, the authorities agreed to speed up health sector
reform by outsourcing some non-medical services with the aim of generating savings by
reducing total health sector employment. Over the longer term, this would create space for
some wage decompression for highly qualified medical staff. The Belgrade municipality also
agreed to curtail spending, to be cemented by a supplementary budget. Some of these cuts
carry notable implementation risks as they are tied to politically sensitive lay-offs. To reduce
the social cost of adjustment from public sector downsizing, the budget includes outlays for
redundancy payments and active labor market policies (¶20).
13.
The programmed fiscal tightening in Serbia in 2005/06 will be supported by the
following policies/reforms:
•

Local governments (¶18). To improve fiscal coordination, the central government
will make wage and price increases in local utilities subject to approval by the central
government. In addition, the city of Belgrade has agreed to amend its budget to scale
back expenditure by 0.2 percent of GDP in 2005.

•

Tax arrears (¶19). Bankruptcy procedures against non-payers will be stepped up by
active recourse to the new procedures to improve both tax collection and financial

13

Overall revenue will decline on account of the elimination of the financial transactions tax in January 2005, and
the tax cuts implemented in the second half of 2004.

- 15 -

discipline. On this basis, the stock of tax arrears will be reduced by 0.7 percent of GDP
in 2005.
•

Pension reform (¶21). The various pension funds for employees, farmers, and selfemployed, whose deficit, covered by budgetary transfers, has reached 6 percent of GDP
will be reformed. Specifically, a phased reform over four years will (i) increase the
retirement age by 2 years; (ii) base the pension indexation formula solely on inflation;
and (iii) replace quarterly with annual pensions indexation at end-2005. These
measures are expected to result in annual savings of about 0.6 percent of GDP in 2006.

•

Public expenditure management (¶23–24). The action plan to reorganize and
improve treasury operations was issued in March, requiring that the accounts of indirect
budget users be closed and incorporated into the budget. Budget control will also be
improved by incorporating all spending programs, including foreign-financed projects,
into a unified budgetary framework in 2006. The authorities have requested technical
assistance from the Fund to assess fiscal risks arising from potential public-privatepartnerships and their macroeconomic effects.

14.
To improve public sector financial discipline in Serbia, arrears collection will be
improved in the energy companies, and tight incomes policy will continue. The oil
company (NIS) and the electricity company (EPS) have set quarterly collection targets of bills
and arrears, to be enforced by a stricter disconnection policy. To reduce quasi-fiscal losses, the
staff also recommended pricing of utilities at cost-recovery levels—provided appropriate
restructuring is implemented—independently of its possible impact on headline inflation.
Similarly, the pricing formula linking domestic to world prices should be used more
consistently to ensure adjustment to higher world energy prices. The authorities agreed in
principle, but indicated that this may require lowering excise taxes to mitigate the impact on
inflation. The strict incomes policy in the public sector agreed under the program will continue
(¶37).
15.
In Montenegro, the fiscal deficit will be reduced by about 1 percent of GDP to
reach 2.7 percent of GDP in 2005 to contain demand and the external balance. To achieve
this target, transfers and other outlays will be cut relative to the budget, reduction of public
employment will be stepped up, and no further tax cuts will be granted. The large expected
privatization proceeds (10 percent of Montenegrin GDP) will be used mainly to retire domestic
debt. Staff urged the authorities to resist spending pressures and to postpone the large planned
infrastructure projects to avoid destabilizing macroeconomic balances. Instead, the authorities
should strengthen revenue collection, accelerate civil service reform, and improve debt and
asset management to create room for additional investment (¶26–27).
C. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
16.
Monetary policy will be tightened further in Serbia in 2005 to help contain
domestic demand and inflationary pressures, with an increasing reliance on indirect
instruments (¶29–30). As the prudential measures undertaken in early 2005 have not slowed

- 16 -

down overall credit growth, further tightening of policies was needed. The NBS will step up
repo operations to reduce liquidity with substantial frontloading by end-June. This will be
complemented by increasing the reserve requirement on enterprise foreign exchange deposits
and banks’ foreign borrowing by 5 percentage point to 26 percent. At the same time, the
reserve requirements on dinar deposits will be lowered from 21 to 20 percent to help develop
dinar markets. To level-off the playing field, leasing activities will be brought under prudential
controls.
17.
A slower rate of dinar depreciation14 is expected to help disinflation (¶31). While
this carries considerable risks for the external balance through potential real appreciation, these
concerns will be mitigated by the tighter-than-previously- programmed fiscal and monetary
policy. Furthermore, given the structural nature of the external imbalance following a decade
of economic isolation, the acceleration of structural reform should lower the current account
risks in the medium term.
D. Financial Sector Reform
18.
The restructuring of the banking sector and the strengthening of financial sector
regulation and supervision will continue in line with FSAP recommendations (¶32–35).15
In Serbia, privatization of 5 state-owned banks is underway and legislation is being prepared to
strengthen the financial infrastructure, in particular in the areas of deposit insurance, bank
liquidation, and the Bank Rehabilitation Agency. Moreover, to address prudential risks
resulting from strong credit expansion, the NBS is committed to reform the legal framework
for bank regulation and supervision in line with the recommendations of the recent FSAP
mission (Box 3), while continuing to step up on-site and off-site supervision. A new banking
law will be enacted in November to align the regulatory framework with Basel Core Principles,
including by strengthening governance and the framework for risk management, internal
control, and audits. In the insurance sector, the two largest socially owned insurance
companies will be prepared for privatization and restructuring. The development of the nonbank financial sector will also benefit from new laws on securities, investment funds and
pension funds. In Montenegro, privatization of 3 banks with a majority state-ownership is also
well advanced and is expected to be completed this year (¶36).

14

The authorities have announced a targeted depreciation of 10 percent for the euro-/dinar rate during 2005. To
achieve this target, the NBS intervenes regularly during the fixing sessions with commercial banks. In the first five
months of 2005, foreign currency inflows have increased gross reserves by US$177 million (or US$451 million at
constant end-2004 exchange rates) to counter the appreciation pressure.

15

See Box 3 for a summary of the findings of the April 2005 FSAP mission.

- 17 -

Box 3: Key Findings of the 2005 Serbia FSAP Mission
The rapid move from a limited state-controlled to a dynamic market-driven financial sector is
creating new and difficult policy challenges. The rapid credit expansion, largely fueled by foreign
banks, whose share in total banking system assets rose to 52 percent, is contributing to the long-term
economic recovery of Serbia. At the same time, however, rapid credit growth brings with it new
risks, especially in the context of the unsustainable current account deficit and stubbornly high
inflation.
While the financial system is broadly stable, there are two main systemic risks that could come
to the fore if the rapid pace of credit growth continues. First, credit risks are arising from the
47 percent growth in bank loans during 2004 and the increase in non-performing loans, which
amount to nearly one-fourth of loans. Moreover, as virtually all new lending is indexed to the euro,
credit risk resulting from borrowers’ exposure to exchange-rate risk has risen significantly, as the
low share of exports in GDP implies that many borrowers are unhedged. Second, the state-owned
banks, especially the two largest, could pose systemic risks prior to their privatization owing to their
weak financial performance and governance.
These risks are exacerbated by weaknesses in banking regulation and supervision. While
banking supervision has improved over the last few years, gaps in the banking law and regulations,
nonfinancial ownership of some banks, the absence of consolidated supervision, and weak
enforcement reduce its effectiveness.
To mitigate the risks, the legal framework for banking regulation and supervision should be
brought in line with Basel Core Principles. In particular, the new banking law, scheduled to be
adopted by parliament by mid-November, should require accurate and timely asset classifications,
introduce consolidated banking supervision, establish explicit statutory protection for NBS staff,
strengthen “fit-and-proper” criteria, and require banks’ boards of directors to accept responsibility
for establishing and overseeing integrated risk management systems.
Changes in the legal environment need to be accompanied with vigorous efforts to end
regulatory forbearance. In particular, it is imperative to step up the resolute enforcement of the
results of supervisory examinations, and to improve systems of internal controls, risk management,
governance, and data reporting. To contain risks emanating from the two systemically important
state-owned banks, vigorous efforts to accelerate their privatization, combined with immediate
improvements in governance, are key.
In addition, financial development in Serbia is highly unbalanced. While lending by foreign
banks is surging and leasing growing sharply, nonbank financial markets are either small or
nonexistent. The uneven development largely reflects key gaps in the legal and regulatory
framework. In this context, it is important to remove impediments to the healthy growth of the
insurance sector, in particular by restructuring and privatizing the two large socially-owned
insurance companies. For the development of the nascent capital markets, the creation of a
supporting legal framework is the key issue at this stage. The securities regulator suffers from
insufficient legal authority and weak institutional capacity. Investment funds in Serbia remain
unregulated and pose a risk for future private pension funds. Reforms should focus on revising
legislation, strengthening the regulatory agencies, and enforcing high standards of accountability
and transparency.

- 18 -

E. Enterprise Reform
19.
Enterprise restructuring and privatization will be further accelerated to enhance
growth and medium-term external sustainability (¶38–43). This will build on the efforts
already intensified since late-2004:
•

Privatization of socially owned enterprises through tenders, auctions, and sales of
government minority-shares will continue, with a view to offering at least
350 companies through auctions, and 14 through tenders by end-year. The
remaining 1500 will be offered for sale in 2006. Privatization will be facilitated by debt
workouts under the new framework facilitating a write-off of debt to state creditors and
public utilities, which was approved in May. Reallocation of resources should be
speeded up with the intensified use of bankruptcy for unsellable companies envisaged
this year. The plans to reduce subsidies to a mining complex and car factory by
stepping up their restructuring are a major step in signaling an end to passive subsidies
to unprofitable activities despite political sensitivities.

•

Restructuring of public enterprises will accelerate including with the sale of some
core and most non-core assets. The electricity company was unbundled with a view to
improving the efficiency of its operations and reducing core employment. The
petroleum company will be split into four units in July, and a tender launched to
prepare for a majority privatization of the refineries in early 2006. About 104 non-core
entities will be transferred to the privatization agency from the 8 monitored public
enterprises in various steps. As these include attractive assets like hotels and catering,
their privatization should contribute to growth and job creation over time.

•

In Montenegro, several large public enterprises will be offered for sale in 2005,
including the tobacco and the lottery companies, and hotels, while others will be
prepared for privatization (¶44).
IV. REVIEW ISSUES AND FINANCING ASSURANCES

20.
The staff supports the authorities’ request for waivers for the missed performance
criteria, as corrective actions were undertaken to ensure that the implementation of the
underlying policy measures remain broadly on track. Both the continuous and the endMarch performance criteria on the ceiling of outstanding external arrears in Montenegro were
breached by a small margin, but they were cleared in May. The end-December structural
performance criterion on changing the laws on the Yugoslav army and union-level civil
employees was only partially met with delays, but the envisaged downsizing will be achieved
with other measures. The end-February 2005 structural performance criterion on the legal
registration of the new electricity transmission and dispatch company was delayed to July due
to more time needed to formally separate the companies, while their restructuring is on
schedule. Given the strengthened conditionality, staff supports the authorities’ request to
maintain the combined purchase for the fifth review, and to rephase the eleventh and final

- 19 -

purchase to become available upon the completion of the sixth review, which would cover
July–November 2005 test dates.
21.
Program conditionality has been strengthened to address the mounting
macroeconomic risks and to support the authorities’ reform efforts (Appendix III,
Annexes A and C).
•

The prior actions for the completion of the fifth review reflect a frontloading of
important structural measures in Serbia regarding pensions, privatization of socially
owned enterprises, and spin-off of non-core companies of state-owned enterprises, as
well as tighter monetary policy.

•

The quantitative performance criteria will be set for end-June and end-September
2005 and reflect the tighter fiscal and monetary stances.

•

The structural performance criteria and benchmarks support faster structural
reform in the financial and enterprise sectors, and important fiscal reforms. Structural
performance criteria relate to critical reforms in Serbia in the state-owned electricity
and oil sectors; passage of supplementary budgets by Serbia and the city of Belgrade to
implement the envisaged fiscal stance; passage of the 2006 budget, the pension reform
and the new banking law; and further spinning off of non-core companies of public
enterprises.

22.
Negotiations on settling pending external arrears have progressed, and the
external financing outlook remains adequate. The debt swap envisaged under the July 2004
agreement with the London Club was implemented in April with the issuance of a 20-year
bond in April.16 The Paris Club agreement has been implemented with all but one creditor; past
debt with China and Russia is close to being settled; and negotiations with other bilateral and
commercial creditors are progressing. Arrears with Russia emerged in Montenegro, but were
settled. The remaining 15 percent of the Paris Club debt reduction is pending until completion
of the EA, in line with the Agreed Minutes of the 2001 agreement. External grants and loans,
FDI, and other capital inflows are expected to allow an increase in gross external reserves to
about $5.6 billion by end-2005 (4⅓ months of prospective imports).

16

Under the agreement with the London Club, SM’s debt is reduced by about 62 percent in NPV terms, which the
Paris Club accepted as broadly comparable with its own debt relief. The 20-year US$1.08 billion bond with a
5-year grace period carries a 3.75 percent coupon for the first 5 years and a 6.75 percent coupon for the next
15 years. The London Club agreement does not cover around US$70 million of arrears on some bonds, the holders
of which did not participate in the 1988 debt rescheduling. The authorities are preparing for negotiations to obtain
a rescheduling from these creditors on the same terms as the July 2004 agreement.

- 20 -

V. STAFF APPRAISAL
23.
The recent surge in demand, while supporting strong growth, has increased
inflation, the external deficit, and overall risks, despite a tightening of macroeconomic
policies. Demand has continued to outpace supply, reflecting dissaving by the private sector
with increased access to credit, and failure to reallocate resources from unprofitable and
overstaffed state and socially-owned enterprises. The situation has been complicated by a surge
in direct foreign borrowing by privatized companies at end-2004. Although the
macroeconomic picture is distorted by the VAT introduction that led to a one-off boost to
inflation and a shift of imports, external borrowing, and output from 2005 to end-2004, the
underlying current account deficit and core inflation remain too high. Furthermore, the surge in
foreign debt towards end-2004 has increased external vulnerability to sudden stops in funding.
24.
The authorities have responded to these challenges with a strong package of
substantially tighter macroeconomic policies, faster structural reform, and an exchange
rate anchor. This package is expected to reverse inflation, thereby reducing short-term risks
for macroeconomic stability, while both the current account deficit and inflation would be
lowered by reining in demand with tighter fiscal, incomes, and monetary policies. At the same
time, the faster structural reforms would improve the prospects for sustainable growth.
25.
The substantial further tightening of the fiscal stance is welcome, but the quality
of the adjustment needs to be improved to ensure its sustainability. The VAT introduction
has been successful in contributing to strong revenues, which were also supported by robust
demand and improved tax administration. Nevertheless, reliance on improved tax collection or
endogenous increases in revenues, has large downside risks. Therefore, the authorities should
stand ready to implement the identified contingency measures, if revenues underperform, and
resist any further reductions in taxes this year. On expenditures, the agreed spending cuts in the
2005 budget are being implemented, including subsidies. The backtracking on civil service
reform is regrettable, and it should be avoided in other areas to reduce risks for achieving the
fiscal targets this year. Long-overdue reforms to address the pension fund deficit are necessary
and should improve the sustainability of the fiscal stance by enabling permanent reductions in
spending from 2006 onwards.
26.
The agreed further monetary tightening should support fiscal and incomes
policies in containing domestic demand. The impact of monetary policy on credit growth
remains uncertain, however, owing to the high degree of euroization in the economy and
intensified competition by foreign banks for market share. For this reason, monetary
instruments should continue to be complemented by a strengthened application of prudential
rules to promote financial stability and contain credit growth. Over time, the focus of policies
should shift increasingly from reserve requirements to repo operations.
27.
Vigorous efforts to complete the privatization of state-controlled banks need to
continue, while the increase in foreign currency-indexed credit calls for enhanced
supervision. Rapid privatization of the two largest state-owned banks would reduce systemic

- 21 -

risks. The new banking law should be fully in line with Basel Core Principles as recommended
by the recent FSAP mission. Moreover, the new prudential rules to improve the monitoring
and management of credit risk resulting from borrowers’ exposure to exchange rate risk should
be vigorously implemented. The recent measures to enhance leasing and insurance supervision
are welcome.
28.
The exchange rate policy in Serbia carries risks. While a more stable exchange rate
regime should support disinflation, it is bound to put pressure on the already large current
account deficit and increase balance sheet risks through potential underestimation of foreign
exchange risk. The tightening of macroeconomic policies in this context should restrain
demand, while the speedier structural reform should, over time, increase competitive supply
and reduce medium-term risks associated with the external balance. Strengthened prudential
rules on foreign currency borrowing should address some of the potential moral hazard
associated with the exchange rate. Exchange rate policy should be kept under review in light of
inflation and current account developments.
29.
Incomes policies continue to be critical in containing domestic demand and
inflationary pressures, and improving competitiveness. Government employees and public
enterprises have a leading role in the labor market, and the authorities’ efforts to contain wage
increases are commendable. The risk for slippages in state-owned enterprises and in local
government remains high, however, due to weak institutional arrangements and absence of
effective state control. The fragile political situation further diminishes the government’s
ability to strictly implement its income policy.
30.
The acceleration of structural reforms is crucial for reducing the macroeconomic
imbalances over time and should be implemented without delay despite potential
resistance from vested interests. While bankruptcies and downsizing will affect employment
in the near term, the privatization of non-core assets and socially owned enterprises is likely to
create new and more secure jobs over time. The envisaged redundancy payments should
mitigate social costs.
31.
The risks to the program are considerable, both politically and economically. The
fragile coalition will be tested by the implementation of many difficult measures, especially in
the structural area. The uncertain impact of the macroeconomic tightening on credit growth
and foreign borrowing, the main causes of excess demand in 2004, and suppressed
administrative price increases, carry risks for inflation and the external balance. This is
compounded by the limited effectiveness of monetary policy owing to high euroization, and
potential difficulties in implementing the agreed permanent expenditure cuts.
32.
The staff supports the authorities’ request to complete the fifth review under the
EA, including the financing assurance review. The staff also supports the requests for
waivers for the missed performance criteria, since the targeted measures were adopted with
short delays, or corrective measures were implemented. While overall program implementation
and inflation and current account performance have been disappointing, the policies outlined in
the authorities’ MEFP provide an appropriate response to the key risks and challenges ahead.

1/ From 2002 onwards, retail sales tax includes revenues that were redirected to the Army and the Railway.
2/ 2004 includes previously off-budget revenue and spending, most of which represents an excise surtax on petrol

Safeguards Assessments:
Under the Fund’s safeguards assessment policy, the National Bank of Yugoslavia
(now NBS) was subject to a safeguards assessment with respect to the Extended
Arrangement approved on May 13, 2002, which is scheduled to expire on December

1

This schedule presents all currently scheduled payments to the IMF, including repayment expectations where
applicable and repayment obligations otherwise. The IMF Executive Board can extend repayment expectations
(within predetermined limits) upon request by the debtor country if its external payments position is not strong
enough to meet the expectations without undue hardship or risk.

31, 2005. A safeguards assessment of the NBY was completed on November 29,
2001. The assessment concluded that substantial risks may exist in the financial
reporting framework, internal audit mechanism, and system of internal controls as
reported in IMF Country Report No. 02/105. The proposed remedies by the mission
are being implemented.

Exchange Arrangement

Serbia and Montenegro accepted the obligations under Article VIII as of May 2002.
The currency of Serbia is the Serbian dinar. On January 1, 2001, Serbia adopted a
managed float system. During 1994–99, the dinar was officially pegged to the DM;
for most of the period, multiple exchange rates were in effect. Montenegro has
adopted the euro as its sole legal tender.

provision, respectively. At this stage of Serbia and Montenegro's reforms, they have
primarily focused on institution-building. The FAD missions reviewed the progress
in modernizing tax administration and establishing treasury system, and
recommended (i) more clearly delineating the tax policy role of different revenue
agencies, (ii) improving taxpayer services and compliance programs based on
segmenting the tax base, (iii) strengthening the Treasury’s organization and
developing its core operations as wells as debt management functions,
(iv) reforming the payroll system and strengthening the quality of personnel records
in budget institutions to eliminate “ghost employment.” The MFD
recommendations were key to (i) developing market-based instruments for
monetary operations, (ii) improving public sector debt management, (iii) providing
a clear focus to future work on enhancing banking supervision practices and (iv)
outlining positive directions for NBS reorganization. The STA missions provided
an action plan to improve existing statistics by (i) developing comprehensive data
sources for national accounts, (ii) applying statistical concepts to organize
information on government revenues and expenditures to develop sound
government finance statistics, (iii) strengthening the coverage of balance of
payments transactions in Montenegro, and assisting with the adoption of
compilation methodologies consistent with the recommendations of the fifth edition
of the Balance of Payments Manual (BPM5), and (iv) introducing sound
classifications in compiling monetary and financial statistics.

APPENDIX II

SERBIA AND MONTENEGRO: IMF-WORLD BANK RELATIONS
Partnership with Serbia and Montenegro’s Development Strategy
1.
On May 8, 2001 the World Bank's Board approved the succession of the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) to SFRY's membership in the International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (IBRD). FRY membership in the International
Development Association (IDA) was confirmed on June 11, 2001. Following constitutional
changes, FRY completed its transition to Serbia and Montenegro (SM) on February 4, 2003.
The government of SM and its two constituent republics of Serbia and Montenegro have
highlighted progress in structural reform and stabilization, and outlined their medium-term
development strategies in their respective Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSP). The
Joint Staff Assessment (JSA) of the PRSP was endorsed by the IMF Board on March 2 and
was reviewed by the Bank's Board of Directors on March 16, 2004.
2.
In the context of a program supported by a three-year Extended Arrangement (EA)
the IMF takes the lead on macroeconomic (fiscal, monetary, and exchange rate) policies
aimed at facilitating sustainable growth. In addition to macroeconomic targets, the Fund has
established structural performance criteria and benchmarks in areas such as tax
administration, payments system reform, banking reform, financial markets, foreign trade
policy, and energy tariffs. Working together with bilateral donors, the Fund has also provided
technical assistance in the first three areas.
3.
As outlined more fully below, the Bank has complemented the Fund's work through
its support to structural reforms. In areas of direct interest to the Fund, the Bank leads the
policy dialogue in: (i) public expenditure management; (ii) macroeconomically important
sectoral reforms (e.g. in the energy sector), (iii) pension, health and social assistance reform;
(iv) the restructuring and privatization of enterprises; and (v) legal reforms with a bearing on
the business environment, including labor markets. The Bank and Fund have jointly led the
policy dialogue in the financial sector, including on the restructuring and privatization of
banks, and in foreign trade. The Bank's program of investment lending, is described more
fully below.
World Bank Group Strategy
4.
The first stage of World Bank assistance commenced even before SM's membership.
In view of its urgent needs, and concurrent with the arrears clearance process, the Bank
established in May 2001 a Trust Fund for FRY (TFFRY) using US$30 million of IBRD
surplus net income to provide grant financing for selected priority activities. Five grants
totaling US$30 million were approved under the TFFRY. These grants, which were
important in laying the foundations for the IDA-financed program, included (i) a private
sector technical assistance grant for Serbia, (ii) a financial sector technical assistance grant
for Serbia, (iii) a social protection grant for Serbia; (iv) an electric power emergency
reconstruction grant for Serbia, and (v) an environmental infrastructure grant for
Montenegro.

- 44 -

APPENDIX II

5.
The second stage of assistance began on May 8, 2001, when the Bank's Board of
Directors endorsed a first Transitional Support Strategy (TSS) for SM.1 The TSS contained a
three-year IDA envelope of up to US$540 million for SM on a temporary and exceptional
basis, with actual lending to depend upon performance against agreed benchmarks. It was
envisaged that up to 80 percent of the program could support policy-based lending. A first
year program of lending, economic and sector work and technical assistance was outlined.
The Transitional Support Strategy Update, discussed by the Bank's Board on August 8, 2002,
confirmed the overall approach (including the focus on policy-based lending), and laid out
the Bank's program for FY03. A second TSS Update, covering FY04, was endorsed by the
Bank's Board on March 16, 2004.
6.
A Joint World Bank-IFC Country Assistance Strategy covering FY05-07 was
endorsed by the Bank’s Board of Directors on December 16, 2004. The CAS has three goals:
(i) creating a smaller, more sustainable and more efficient public sector; (ii) creating a larger,
more dynamic private sector; and (iii) reducing poverty levels and improving social
protection and access to public services.
7.
Given the extensive de jure and de facto devolution of responsibility for economic
policy to the member state level, the program of adjustment lending is focused at the republic
level. To date, seven operations have been approved. In Serbia, a multi-sectoral Structural
Adjustment Credit (SAC-approved in January 2002) was designed to enhance fiscal
sustainability through reforms of public expenditure management, the energy sector, social
protection, labor markets, and health care. A Social Sector Adjustment Credit (approved in
April 2003), supported further reforms in pensions, health and labor, while enhancing the
focus on social assistance and poverty monitoring. Two Private and Financial Sector
Adjustment Credits (PFSAC I and II, approved May 2002 and June 2003 respectively) focus
on the growth promotion agenda, assisting the government in: (i) strengthening the financial
system through the liquidation of troubled banks and an improved policy and regulatory
environment; (ii) privatizing and restructuring socially-owned enterprises; and (iii)
improving the investment and business climate., A second (single tranche) multisectoral SAC
for Serbia was approved in December 2004. It’s focus centers on improving the business
environment, further rehabilitating the energy sector, enhancing social protection and
fostering stronger public administration. In Montenegro, the first multi-sectoral Structural
Adjustment Credit, approved in August 2002 supported reforms critical to fiscal
sustainability as well as economic growth in the areas of public expenditure management,
pensions, energy, labor markets, and the business environment. A second (two tranche)
multi-sectoral SAC for Montenegro was approved by the Board on September 14, 2004. It
focuses on enhancing growth potential, including reforms to the financial, energy, pension,
health and public administration sectors.
1

A plan to clear SM’s arrears to the World Bank was approved with the membership packages that provided for
the exceptional consolidation of SM's arrears and principal not yet due into a new package of IBRD loans.
These Consolidation Loans were approved by the Board on December 13, 2001, and became effective in early
January 2002.

- 45 -

APPENDIX II

8.
The Bank's program of adjustment lending has been underpinned by analytical
studies. In June 2001, the Bank, working together with the European Commission and the
federal and republican governments, completed an Economic Recovery and Transition
Program (ERTP), which was presented to the Donor Conference held the same month.2
In 2002, the Bank focused on three complementary studies which covered both republics—a
Public Expenditure and Institutional Review (PEIR), a Country Financial Accountability
Assessment (CFAA), and a Country Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR). Studies of
the agricultural (Serbia) and environmental sectors (both republics) were also completed. The
Bank supports an ongoing program on improving the monitoring and analysis of poverty.
Poverty Household Surveys for both republics laid the foundations for a Poverty Assessment,
completed in 2003. The Bank recently finalized an Economic Memorandum for Serbia
focusing on the agenda for sustained growth and employment creation. An Economic
Memorandum for Montenegro has been initiated for delivery this fiscal year.
9.
In both republics, a program of selective investment lending has been designed to
assist the authorities to tackle critical impediments to effective public sector management and
private sector development, improve social policy and underpin reforms initiated under the
Bank-supported adjustment programs. A Trade and Transport Facility for Southeast Europe
and an Export Finance project have been approved which cover both Serbia and
Montenegro's needs. In addition, in Serbia IDA is supporting an Education project, an
Enterprise and Bank Restructuring Technical Assistance operation, an Energy Efficiency
project , a Health Reform operation, an Employment Promotion Learning and Innovation
project, a Transport Rehabilitation project, and a Real Property Registration and Cadastre
project. In Montenegro, an education reform project was recently approved on March 31,
2005. The Bank also supports an Environmental Improvement project an Energy Learning
and Innovation Credit, a Pension System Administration and Improvement Project and a
Health Reform project. As of end-April 2005, 21 IDA credits totaling US$ 590 million had
been approved for SM, with adjustment support comprising the majority
IFC
10.
SM is a major IFC priority in South East Europe. During FY02-03 IFC committed
about US$43 million in 5 projects, three in financial markets and two in manufacturing.
Donor supported technical assistance (TA) has been an important component of the IFC
strategy to develop a pipeline of potential investments in SM. During the last two years IFC
has mobilized about US$4 million of trust fund resources for technical assistance conducting
more than twenty assignments on institutional strengthening in the financial sector and on
project preparation in the real sector.

11.
IFC has contributed to strong foreign strategic investor interest in the financial sector
and to establishing viable financial institutions. IFC supported the first Microfinance Bank
and the establishment of RaiffeisenBank in the country. In Montenegro, IFC approved an
investment in Opportunity Bank Montenegro for a line of credit of up to Euro4 million to
fund micro-enterprise and SME lending. IFC is supporting the restructuring and privatization
of Udruzena Vojvodjanska Bank (UVB) successor banks. Also, the recent agreement
between IFC and the Government of Montenegro on the restructuring of IFC’s claims on
Montenegrin enterprises and banks, should pave the way for additional IFC restructuring and
privatization support in the financial sector. IFC’s Southeast Europe Enterprise Development
facility (SEED) has provided extensive assistance to the institutional development of leasing
market and to overall SME sector development. IFC has provided extensive due diligence to
the Serbian Insurance Supervisor and has conducted a preliminary due diligence on the
restructuring and privatization of Dunav Insurance Company.
12.
In the corporate sector, IFC has achieved good results investing Euro20 million in
Tigar Michelin Holding, a leading regional producer of high quality car tires. The financing
was accompanied by extensive technical assistance to the company and its suppliers,
supported by SEED linkages program, resulting in high development impact. IFC is
providing an innovative technical assistance program to Elektronska Industrija, a Serbian
manufacturer of consumer electronic products and home appliances, to help the company
with pre-privatization restructuring and to facilitate the joint ventures and/or direct sales to
foreign investors.
13.
In tandem with the Bank’s program of support, IFC is committed to supporting the
restructuring and preparation for privatization of the infrastructure sector, as well as
facilitating private sector participation in the sector. Through its Balkans Infrastructure
Development Facility (BIDFacility), IFC will help public sector entities in the South East
Europe region, including Serbia and Montenegro, to attract private sector participation and
investments in infrastructure, primarily in the energy, transport and water and sanitation
sectors. IFC focus will be to explore, facilitate, and support public-private partnership (PPP)
opportunities, particularly in solid waste and water management services (city of Belgrade),
oil and gas transport and distribution, and the power cogeneration sector. In the area of
information and communication technology, IFC will explore investment opportunities in the
sector. In the energy sector, IFC has been active supporting an advisory assignment to
prepare a restructuring and privatization strategy of the Serbian oil company Naftna
Industrija Srbije (NIS), as well as launching a Power Cogeneration study to survey the
market potential and identify opportunities for private sector participation and PPP.
14.
Though foreign investors’ country risk appetite remains modest, opportunities for
new IFC investment projects are being actively pursued in both the financial and
manufacturing sectors. IFC’s program development, however, depends on further
implementation of the Governments reform agenda, the creation of a favorable business
climate, and the acceleration of the privatization process. While in the short term IFC will
continue to expand its activities in general manufacturing and the financial sectors, in the
longer term IFC will look for opportunities to support Serbia and Montenegro with

- 47 -

APPENDIX II

investments in the energy and telecommunication sectors, as well as in the infrastructure
sector.
MIGA
15.
As of November 30, 2004, MIGA’s outstanding guarantee portfolio in SM consisted
of 15 guarantee contracts: 13 in the financial sector, one in the services sector, and one in the
manufacturing sector, with a total gross exposure of US$344.2 million and a total net
exposure of US$170.6 million. At 6.3 percent of MIGA's total gross exposure, SM is now
MIGA's fourth largest host country. MIGA also provides TA (institutional development and
capacity building) on investment promotion to both Serbia and Montenegro. An initial
project benefiting the Serbia Investment and Export Promotion Agency (SIEPA) is nearing
completion. A comprehensive follow-on project with a two- to three-year time horizon is
expected to be launched in early 2005; this project will be implemented by MIGA on behalf
of the EAR. In Montenegro, also with financial support from the EAR, MIGA is currently
implementing an initial capacity building project in support of the new Montenegrin
Investment Promotion Agency. MIGA’s TA activities in SM are feeding into a new, regional
FDI outreach and marketing initiative for the Western Balkans which MIGA launched in
summer 2004 (that is, the European Investor Outreach Program for the Western Balkans).
Joint Staff Assessment (JSA) of the Poverty Reduction Strategies
16.
Bank and Fund staff produced a joint assessment of the authorities' poverty reduction
strategies as proposed in the PRSP of each republic. Bank staff took the lead in evaluating
the structural measures to underpin poverty reduction, while Fund staff assessed the
macroeconomic framework underlying the strategies. The JSA enumerates the strengths of
the envisioned poverty reduction strategies, notably the focus on harmonization to common
EU standards, continuing privatization, an improved business environment, and policies to
raise employment. However, staff also found that the reports could usefully have relied on
less optimistic assumptions regarding domestic savings, foreign financing inflows and the
financing of poverty reduction programs, addressed crime and governance more directly, and
provided a sharper sense of prioritization among possible projects. Staff agreed that the
envisioned market-oriented reforms, if implemented in the context of continuing
macroeconomic stability, will foster a considerable reduction in poverty.
Bank-Fund Collaboration in Specific Areas
17.
As part of its overall assistance to SM, the Bank combines lending, analytical work
and technical assistance to support policy reforms, with a focus on the following areas:
18.
Public expenditure management. SM's weak systems of public financial
management had long contributed to macroeconomic instability, a lack of transparency, and
the inefficient use of public resources, requiring reforms and institution building in this area.
The Bank is taking the lead with a multi-pronged assistance program, which the Fund is
complementing with policy conditionality and technical assistance. The Bank's program
began with the completion in 2002 of the PEIR, CFAA, and CPAR (see above), which in

- 48 -

APPENDIX II

turn helped to define significant public expenditure management components in the first
SACs for Serbia and Montenegro. In Serbia, key reforms supported by the Bank included the
adoption of the Law on the Budget System (Organic Budget Law), the first steps toward
introducing a treasury system, and enhanced inspection, auditing and procurement
procedures. In Montenegro, where legal and institutional reforms had reached a more
advanced stage, key reforms include the establishment of a more comprehensive multi-year
framework for budget preparation, continued implementation of the interim treasury system,
and improvements in the internal audit. Care is being taken to ensure consistency of the
PRSP with available budgetary resources.
19.
Energy sector reform. The combination of low power prices and collection rates, a
decade of underinvestment and lack of maintenance, and war-related physical damage, led to
power shortages and left SM with loss-making and inefficient electric utilities. As the largest
single source of quasi-fiscal pressures, the power sector became an area of particularly close
collaboration between the Bank and the Fund. While the Bank has taken the lead in
developing the policy agenda, the sector's fiscal impact has also motivated limited but strong
conditionality in successive Fund arrangements. The Bank program has combined support for
policy reforms with investment credits/grants for critical needs in both Serbia and
Montenegro, improved financial management and technical assistance. The SACs for both
republics focused on improving the financial position of the republican power utilities
through measures to enhance revenues (phased tariff increases and improved collections) or
reduce operating costs (e.g. control of the wage bill). Progress in achieving tariff rate targets
is being monitored closely both by the Bank and the Fund. In parallel, the electric power
emergency reconstruction grant for Serbia under the TFFRY supported urgent repairs,
improvements in the financial management of the electric power company, and legal and
policy advisory services. The Bank provides continuing support to the sector in Serbia with
an Energy Efficiency Credit and complementary Global Environmental Fund grant, now
under preparation. The already approved Montenegro Energy Sector Learning and
Innovation Credit will introduce automated billing and demand management, facilitate the
eventual privatization of distribution services and lay the basis for institutional strengthening.
20.
Pension, health and social assistance reform. The state pension systems of both
Serbia and Montenegro account for about one-third of consolidated public spending, and
pension spending as a share of GDP is high by regional standards. Chronic arrears on pension
payments and large budgetary transfers to the pension funds in both republics were further
evidence that reforms were required to improve pension system financial balance and overall
medium-term fiscal sustainability. This created a synergy between Bank and Fund programs.
The Bank has taken the lead, including initial pension reforms in its adjustment operations in
both republics, and providing required technical assistance through the social protection grant
under the TFFRY. The key elements of pension reforms were parametric adjustments to
retirement ages and indexation rules which would bring immediate fiscal savings relative to
the no reform scenario. The Fund has provided supporting fiscal analysis and included
related structural benchmarks in its successive arrangements in SM. The SOSAC for Serbia
supported the next reforms of the pay-as-you-go system, as well as preparatory steps for a
more comprehensive revamping of the pension system. A Pension Systems Administration

- 49 -

APPENDIX II

Improvement Project was approved for Montenegro and work has commenced on a pension
reform technical assistance operation for Serbia for this fiscal year delivery.
21.
Serbia’s SAC also included initial reforms of the health care system to begin restoring
fiscal balance in that sector, as a basis for improving its functioning and ability to provide
basic health care services for all citizens. To this end, the SAC supported the introduction of
modest co-payments, adoption of a more limited essential drugs list, the addressing of
structural inefficiencies in the delivery system, and the laying of foundations for a new policy
and legal framework. The SOSAC deepened this reform agenda. The Bank's involvement in
the health care sector in Montenegro has focused on analytical work, most recently under the
PEIR and a health sector reform project was approved in June 2004.
22.
In Serbia, the Bank's work on reforming other components of the social safety net
began with conditionality and technical assistance under the social protection grant under the
TFFRY. The SAC supported pilot reforms to enhance the equity and coverage of the main
program of social assistance (the so-called Material Assistance to Families), to improve the
management of donor funds for such programs, and to begin development of a new Law on
Employment regulating benefits for unemployed workers. These reforms were completed
and deepened under the SOSAC. The SAC for Montenegro also supported the enactment of a
Law on Labor and Law on Employment.
23.
Restructuring and privatization of enterprises and banks. Beginning in late 2000
in Serbia, and earlier in Montenegro, SM has been engaged in far-reaching reforms of the
enterprise and financial sector. In Serbia, the initial focus in the enterprise sector was on
creating a transparent legal and institutional framework for privatization to attract strategic
investors. The agenda in the banking sector focused on the need to address the deep
insolvency of the banking sector in a permanent and fiscally responsible fashion. The Bank
and the Fund have worked closely together to support the needed policy reforms, with the
Bank taking the lead on the enterprise sector and sharing leadership in the banking sector.
The Bank program has combined sectoral adjustment credits focused on these themes with
parallel projects to provide technical assistance. The Bank has worked closely with the Fund
to formulate the benchmarks in PFSAC I and II which complement and reinforce the
elements of the EA related to financial sector strengthening. Fund conditionality under the
EA has focused on facilitating rapid privatization, ensuring that all privatization proceeds
flow transparently through the budget, and putting in place control mechanisms in banks
prior to their privatization. Under the TFFRY, the Bank provided early support through
private and financial sector technical assistance grants. This work is continued under the
Privatization and Restructuring of Banks and Enterprises Technical Assistance Project. The
Bank has increased its involvement in these areas in Montenegro under the recently approved
second SAC for Montenegro.
24.
Legal reforms with a bearing on the business environment. The Bank has taken
the lead on business environment and general private sector development. The SAC for
Montenegro supported the adoption and initial implementation of the enterprise law,
bankruptcy law, and law on secured transactions. The PFSAC for Serbia supported

- 50 -

APPENDIX II

enactment of laws on foreign direct investment and an SME agency, amendments to federal
and republican enterprise laws, and preparation of a law on secured transactions. The PFSAC
II followed up by supporting the enactment of laws on concessions, leasing, bankruptcy,
business registration, and on Agency for Business Services. In addition, the SACs in both
republics emphasized reforms of the legal framework for the labor market, promoting
employment creation through greater flexibility, and promoting the financial sustainability
and effectiveness of unemployment benefit programs. This complements Fund
conditionalities related to securities and accounting legislation, and rationalizing employment
clauses in social programs associated with privatization and enterprise restructuring. In
FY02, the Bank prepared an initial diagnostic study of Serbia's legal and judicial framework.
A small grant extended to the Government of Serbia supports the improvements in Serbia’s
court administration and the development of a National Judicial Reform Strategy.

challenges, we have updated our economic and policy targets for 2005, as described in detail
in the attached Memorandum on Economic and Financial Policies.
On this basis, we request: (a) completion of the fifth review under the EA; (b) waivers for the
non-observance of an end-December 2004 performance criterion (the enactment of
amendments to the law on the Yugoslav army and Union-level civil employees); an endFebruary 2005 performance criterion (the legal registration of the new electricity
transmission and dispatch company); a March 2005 performance criterion (the nonaccumulation of external arrears); and a continuous performance criterion (on the same
issue); (c) the purchase of SDR 125.0 million following the completion of the fifth review;
and (d) a rephasing of the eleventh and final purchase to become available upon completion
of the sixth review, which would be postponed to cover July-November 2005 test dates. The
non-observance of structural performance criteria has been rectified with delays. We are
taking measures to improve policy implementation in these areas.
We believe that the policies and measures described in the attached memorandum are
sufficient to achieve our program objectives, but we stand ready to take timely additional
measures and seek new understandings with Fund staff, as necessary, to keep the program on
track. We will remain in close consultation with the Fund staff on the adoption of these
measures, and in advance of any revisions to the policies contained in the attached MEFP in
accordance with the Fund’s policies on such consultations. We will provide all information to
the Fund that it requests to assess the implementation of the program. The program will
continue to be reviewed by the Fund, with the Board discussions for the final review
expected in December 2005. The next review will focus on the implementation of strong
fiscal, monetary, and incomes policies and on progress in structural reforms (including
pension reform, budgetary employment reduction, and enterprise restructuring and
privatization)

SERBIA AND MONTENEGRO
MEMORANDUM OF ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL POLICIES
June 8, 2005
I. INTRODUCTION
1.
This memorandum updates and supplements the Memorandum of Economic and
Financial Policies (MEFP) attached to the Letter of Intent of November 29, 2004. It reports
on recent developments under the program supported by the Extended Arrangement (EA)
approved in May 2002 and updates the economic objectives and policy agenda for the
remainder of 2005.1
2.
The performance under the program, supported by the Extended Arrangement
with the Fund, has been mixed (Annex A and B). All but two of the 11 end-December
2004 quantitative performance criteria (PCs) were observed. The ceiling on the wage bill of
the 7 monitored public utilities in Serbia was missed by a small margin due to lump-sum
payments to airline employees, and external arrears were accumulated in Montenegro. All
but one of the 11 end-March 2005 quantitative PCs were met, as the external arrears
accumulated by Montenegro were only settled in May. This also caused a breach of the
continuous PC on non-accumulation of external arrears. The end-December 2004 structural
PC for enacting the amendment to the law on the Privatization Agency was met, but the PC
for enacting the amendments to the laws on the Yugoslav Army and Union-level Civil
Employees was missed. The amendments to the Army law were eventually enacted in
February, although the dismissal notice time was not reduced from three months to thirty
days. The end-February 2005 PC on the unbundling of EPS into two separate companies was
missed, as the two new companies were not legally registered, but the process to enable them
to function as separate companies is on track. In Serbia, four out of five end-November and
end-December 2004 structural benchmarks were met on time. The tender for the privatization
of Niška Banka was launched with some delay on January 31, 2005. The end-February 2005
structural benchmark on establishing a supervisory body to license, supervise, and regulate
bankruptcy trustees was met with a slight delay in March, but the end-March 2005 structural
benchmark on the adoption of new laws on deposit insurance, bank liquidation, and the bank
rehabilitation agency was missed. In Montenegro, the end-December 2004 structural
benchmark on the sale of nonfinancial assets carved-out from the banking system was met,
but those on the transfer of republican government deposits at commercial banks to the
treasury single account and on the issuance of a tender for a majority stake in Podgoricka
Bank were missed.

Annex A, attached to this memorandum, contains the quantitative performance criteria and indicative targets,
while Annexes B and C list the structural performance criteria and benchmarks as well as prior actions.
Annex D (Technical Memorandum of Understanding, TMU) defines the performance criteria and indicative
targets and describes the reporting arrangements.

APPENDIX III

3.
Strong growth in 2004 has been accompanied by accelerating inflation and
increasing external imbalances.
•

Real growth was stronger than expected in 2004. GDP growth is estimated to have
reached 7.5 percent in Serbia (7.2 percent in SM), led by a bumper crop in agriculture
and solid industrial growth supported by output gains in recently privatized
enterprises. Demand was boosted by an increase in consumption and investment fed
by rapid credit growth; an estimated 10.2 percent average increase in real wages in
Serbia (decelerating somewhat in the second half of the year); and an increase in
remittances in both republics. In Montenegro, GDP grew 3-4 percent in 2004,
supported by increasing activity in industry, tourism, and agriculture.

•

Inflation in SM accelerated in the second half of 2004 and in 2005. Twelve-month
inflation in Serbia rose to 17.5 percent in May 2005 (against 8 percent a year before
and 13.7 percent in December 2004), driven by buoyant domestic demand, increases
in administered prices, the rising cost of fuel imports, and the one-off effect of the
VAT introduced in January. Inflation in Montenegro rose in 2004 to 4.3 percent in
December.

•

The SM current account deficit increased further in 2004, reaching 15½ percent
of GDP. Imports rose by 47 percent year-on-year in dollar terms. While export
growth at 38 percent lagged behind, exports accelerated in the second half of 2004,
partially as an effect of past privatizations. While energy imports remained constant
as a share of total imports, the increase in world prices implied a lower growth rate
for imported volumes. Imports at end-year were boosted by a one-off large increase in
anticipation of the introduction of the VAT in Serbia in January 2005. Private
remittances continued to be high at 15 percent of GDP in 2004, but FDI fell to
4 percent of GDP, reflecting a slowdown in privatization in the first half of the year.
Gross foreign reserves rose to US$4¼ billion (3.7 months of projected 2005 imports)
at end-December 2004. In Montenegro, the current account balance showed signs of
improvement in 2004, with FDI inflows of US$60 million consisting mainly of
investment in the tourism sector. However, private sector foreign debt continued to
increase at a high rate.

•

The debt dynamics in SM benefited from the completion of negotiations with
London Club creditors, but the increase in the debt financing of the current
account deficit raises concern. The London Club agreement implies a 62 percent
reduction of the debt to commercial banks, reducing the country’s overall debt burden
by 7 percent of GDP, down from 69 percent at end-2003. However, an increasing
share of the external deficit is financed by debt (about 54 percent) making the country
more vulnerable to external shocks. The increase in mostly private foreign borrowing
by 8 percent of GDP kept the external debt-to-GDP ratio at 62 percent at end-2004.

4.
Developments so far in 2005 were mixed. In Serbia, in the first quarter of 2005, the
trade balance improved, with exports up by 41 percent and imports down by 14 percent

- 55 -

APPENDIX III

relative to the previous year. Cumulative inflation reached 7.1 percent in the first five
months. Industrial production declined by 3.4 percent in the first quarter relative to the same
period last year, although exporting sectors remained strong. In Montenegro, the trade
balance improved further in the first quarter and inflation declined to 3.6 percent.
5.
The buoyancy of budgetary revenues resulted in a lower-than-programmed
budget deficit in Serbia in 2004. Reflecting strong domestic demand and improved tax
enforcement efforts, the revenue performance of the republican and local budgets exceeded
expectations by significant margins. In particular, customs and excise revenues, boosted by
the advancement of imports ahead of the VAT introduction in January, were buoyant, while
improved collections of fees and licenses contributed to an increase in nontax revenue.
Expenditures were generally under tight control.
6.
In Montenegro, fiscal policy contributed to maintaining macroeconomic
stability. The consolidated fiscal deficit declined in 2004 in line with the program. However,
revenues fell somewhat short of the program target, reflecting a stronger-than-expected
negative revenue impact of the 2004 tax reform. Consequently, cash expenditures were
reduced to meet the deficit target. Employment financed from the budget was reduced by
2.4 percent. Despite the expenditure cuts, spending arrears of the consolidated budget did not
increase during 2004. In the first quarter of 2005, the fiscal execution was broadly as
programmed. Privatization receipts, substantially higher than expected, were used to initiate
the repayment of domestic debt and increase government reserves.
7.
Increasing confidence in the banking system in Serbia was accompanied by
growing euroization and rapid credit growth. Reflecting increasing confidence in the
banking sector in line with progress in bank restructuring, remonetization continued, with
broad money relative to GDP increasing from 19.2 percent at end-March 2004 to
22.3 percent at end-March 2005. This was primarily the result of strong growth in foreigncurrency deposits, while the demand for dinar-denominated deposits has stagnated.
Euroization—measured as the share of foreign-currency deposits in total deposits—surged by
5.6 percentage points in one year, reaching 71.7 percent at end-March. Buoyant economic
activity, pent-up demand for durable consumer goods, and a surge in foreign borrowing by
commercial banks and the corporate sector resulted in a lending boom. As a result, the share
of credit in GDP rose from 15 percent at end-March 2004 to 19 percent at end-March 2005.
Lending to households rose from 2.6 percent to 4.6 percent of GDP.
8.
The NBS implemented prudential measures to reduce macroeconomic and
prudential risks:
•

The NBS issued a new guideline on consumer credits, effective December 1, 2004,
recommending (i) limiting the monthly payment to net income ratio to 30 percent;
and (ii) requiring a downpayment of at least 20 percent of the purchase price of
acquired goods. It is closely monitoring compliance with these ratios and stands ready
to further tighten the regulations on consumer lending, should the achieved slowdown
turn out not to be sustained.

- 56 -

APPENDIX III

•

Since January 1, 2005 the stock of commercial banks’ foreign borrowing of
maturities of up to 4 years and all new foreign borrowings by commercial banks
independent of maturities are subject to a minimum reserve requirement of
21 percent, thereby reducing the bias in favor of foreign-sourced funding. Effective
April 11, 2005, all short-term deposits of foreign banks with banks operating in
Serbia are equally subject to the 21 percent reserve requirement.

•

Moreover, to reduce prudential risks, the NBS increased the capital adequacy ratio
from 8 percent to 10 percent, effective March 31, 2005.

•

The NBS moved decisively on enforcing prudential regulations in the insurance
sector through the withdrawal of 18 insurance company licenses in December 2004
and January 2005.

9.
Structural reforms in Serbia gained momentum. In 2004, 456 socially owned
enterprises were offered for sale, of which 336 with 52,000 employees were sold. The
privatization effort was especially strong in the fourth quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of
2005—exceeding the commitments in the previous MEFP. In the fourth quarter of 2004,
184 socially owned companies were offered for sale through auctions with a success rate of
51 percent. During the same period, 13 large socially owned enterprises were offered for sale
through tenders, of which three from the list of companies under restructuring. In the first
quarter of 2005, 78 companies were offered for sale through auctions with a success rate of
35 percent, and 7 companies were offered through tenders, of which 3 under restructuring.
About 1,830 companies remain to be privatized.
10.
Substantial progress was also made in consolidating the banking system, with
marked changes in patterns of bank ownership. Most importantly, the sale of Jubanka was
successfully completed in January 2005 at a price of €150 million, the second-highest
proceeds for any privatization deal in Serbia so far. Five other state-owned banks are
currently passing through the bank privatization program managed by the Bank Restructuring
Agency (BRA). Owing to progress in bank privatization and the acquisition of private
domestic banks by foreign banks, the share of the latter in total bank assets rose to 52 percent
at end-April 2005.
11.
Privatization in Montenegro was accelerated. In mid-2004 the largest steel
producer Niksicka Steelworks was privatized, and in 2005, the local telecommunication
monopoly Telekom Montenegro was sold. An international financial advisor for the
privatization of Podgorička Banka, the largest state-owned bank, was selected in February
and the invitation to express interest was launched in May. The authorities have prepared a
time-bound strategy for the privatization of majority and minority-owned equity stakes in the
remaining state-owned banks. Besides, hotels and other minor assets are being privatized.

- 57 -

APPENDIX III

II. ECONOMIC OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES
12.
The key economic objectives for 2005 and beyond are to reduce inflation and
lower the current account deficit, while supporting sustainable growth (Table):
•

Real GDP growth in SM is projected to reach 4½–5 percent in 2005, owing to the
lower contribution of agriculture, while economic activity in the industrial and service
sectors is expected to remain robust, fueled by buoyant investment and strong, albeit
moderating consumption demand. Growth is projected to average 5 percent in
subsequent years, as restructuring-related output losses subside, privatization and
enterprise restructuring continue, and FDI inflows reach higher levels.

•

End-period inflation in Serbia is targeted to decline to 10 percent by end-2005,
reflecting gradually receding domestic demand pressures and lower increases in
administrative prices and municipal tariffs and fees, and despite the one-off effect of
the VAT introduction in January 2005. There are clear risks to this target, but the
government is committed to take the necessary corrective measures to achieve it, in
particular as regards demand management and fiscal discipline. In Montenegro,
inflation is expected to remain at 3½ percent by end-2005.

•

The external current account deficit (before grants) is projected to decline to about
11 percent in 2005, as policies initiated last year to contain domestic demand are
taking effect with a longer-than-expected lag, and additional measures are being
taken. The current account deficit is projected to continue to decline in the medium
term—reflecting the recovery of exports as structural reforms elicit a supply response
and prudent policies strengthen competitiveness—, thereby contributing to external
sustainability and consistency with expected financing. As structural reforms
accelerate and the business climate improves over the medium term, FDI inflows
could play an increasing role in financing the current account deficit. However,
foreign assistance and loans will remain an important source of financing.

•

The import coverage of foreign reserves at end-2005 will increase to 4 months of
prospective imports, with a view to guarding against possible risks and preparing for
the projected rise in external debt service in the medium-term following the expiry of
grace periods under debt restructuring agreements.

13.
The PRSP process will continue to guide the development agenda and social
policies. The PRSPs adopted by the Serbian and by the Montenegrin governments in
late 2003 outline the key reforms. Social spending will be protected to provide a safety net
for those affected adversely by reforms, while its efficiency will be enhanced through the
improved targeting of benefits.

A. Fiscal Policy
14.
Fiscal policy in 2005 will continue to anchor the stabilization effort and improve
medium-term sustainability. The fiscal balance will improve by 1.5 percentage points of
GDP over 2004 to achieve a surplus of 1.2 percent of GDP in 2005, largely through savings
of revenue exceeding the projections in the budget and targeted expenditure cuts. Reflecting
the tightened fiscal stance, assumed privatization proceeds (3.1 percent of GDP), and foreign
disbursements (0.9 percent of GDP), the fiscal program for 2005 envisages negative domestic
financing equivalent to 5.4 percent of GDP. Privatization proceeds beyond program targets
will be used to reduce net government indebtedness.
Serbia
15.
The fiscal stance in 2005 will be tightened compared to the program. In light of
the rekindling of inflationary pressures and the higher-than-programmed current account
deficit, the fiscal stance for this year needs to be more restrictive than originally expected.
This must be achieved despite significant higher social fund spending, which was not
envisaged at the time of the passage of the 2005 budget. Given this additional expenditure
pressure, the government will scale back spending on current and capital programs already
approved in Republican and City of Belgrade budgets for 2005 by about 0.7 percent of GDP
(the ceiling on expenditure of the Republican budget is a quantitative indicative target), and
will save all revenues exceeding the 2005 budget projections that may arise from the carry
over of strong domestic demand, unless otherwise noted. It will, in consultation with Fund
staff, submit a draft supplementary budget to Parliament—the approval of which will be a

- 59 -

APPENDIX III

structural PC for end-July 2005. The government will also step up tax collection efforts,
including the enforced collection of tax arrears.
16.
The fiscal stance will be reassessed during the sixth review when the
effectiveness of the measures taken so far to rein in domestic demand becomes clearer.
Further fiscal consolidation will be targeted if needed. Moreover, to reduce vulnerability to
external shocks over the medium term, the government is committed to cut permanent
expenditure in 2006 by at least 1 percent of GDP. This will be supported by changes to the
pension law, reform of the health sector, cuts in transfers to municipal governments, and
reductions in subsidies. Submission to Parliament of the 2006 budget consistent with these
parameters, after consultation with Fund staff, will be a structural PC for November 1, 2005.
In the meantime, the government will strengthen control over expenditure commitments of
all direct and indirect budget users to ensure no build-up of expenditure arrears. To help
attain the macroeconomic objectives, no further tax cuts beyond those agreed will be
implemented.
17.
The government will ensure that obstacles hindering the successful
implementation of employment policy are removed. To compensate for the increase in the
wage bill at the union level stemming from the delay in the passage of the army law,
compensating cuts in nonwage expenditure will be carried out. To bring about the planned
reduction in the union-level employment, monthly transfers to the union budget will be
conditional on achieving the targeted monthly reduction in union-level employment. This
will compensate for the Union Parliament not succeeding in amending the law on Unionlevel civil employees to reduce the dismissal notice from 3 months to 1 month, which will
not be resubmitted. The government will ensure that employment in the central government
will be reduced in June, as agreed earlier under the program. However, the proposed
reduction in employment in the general government will be postponed until a strategy for the
education sector is developed. To partly compensate for this delay, the government will
accelerate the reform of the health sector, which will include a reduction in employment. A
strategy for modernizing this sector is at an advanced stage of preparation, and concrete
measures will be developed by end-July under a European Agency for Reconstruction project
(structural benchmark). We expect this project to make recommendations that would
improve the efficiency of the health network by reducing the burden on the public health
budget through streamlining of operations, outsourcing of non-medical services, and spin-off
of non-healthcare assets. In addition, co-payments for health services, which are at a low
level, will be increased in July 2005, with due consideration for vulnerable groups.
18.
To support its broad policy objectives, the government will ensure that local
budgets are in balance or stronger in 2005. Large-scale wage increases for budgetary
sector employees and municipal utility workers—announced by some local authorities—
would undermine the overall fiscal stance and put at risk the effectiveness of the
government’s incomes policy. It is therefore imperative that the local governments stay
within the announced fiscal and incomes policy framework. To this end, the city of Belgrade
has agreed to cut from its planned budgetary spending by 0.2 percent of GDP, primarily in
low priority programs. The approval by the City Council of Belgrade of a revised budget will

- 60 -

APPENDIX III

be a structural PC for end-July 2005. More generally, the central government will also
ensure that wage increases and prices at all local utilities are fully consistent with the law on
public utilities.
19.
To strengthen collection performance of budgetary revenues and harden budget
constraints of socially owned and private enterprises, the government will implement an
ambitious plan to reduce tax arrears. For this purpose, the government established targets
for reducing the stock of tax arrears (including interest and penalties) by SRD 5 billion by
end-June 2005 compared to the end-December 2004 stock (structural benchmark). In each of
the remaining six months of 2005, the stock of these arrears will be reduced by another
SRD 1 billion. These targets will be achieved by stepping up forced execution (including the
confiscation of bank accounts), initiating bankruptcy procedures against non-payers, or by
conditional write-offs for companies undergoing privatization. In view of the revenue risk
associated with these measures, the Ministry of Finance has drawn up contingency
expenditure measures (in goods and services, subsidies, and transfers to the Road Fund)
equivalent to 0.6 percent of GDP, which can be quickly implemented in the event that
revenue performance turns out to be weaker than expected.
20.
The government will carefully reassess the adequacy of budgetary resources for
the restructuring of state- and socially owned enterprises. If necessary, within the overall
expenditure ceiling in the 2005 budget, the government will consider redirecting additional
budgetary resources for restructuring, including to finance layoffs in public enterprises on a
temporary basis (these loans would need to be repaid to the budget by year-end from the
enterprises’ own resources). However, to ensure that funds are effectively used, as indicated
in the previous MEFP, no payments from the Serbian Development Fund will be made to any
enterprise that (i) raised its wage bill by more than projected inflation, and (ii) failed to abide
by its restructuring program.
21.
The government will move decisively to ensure the long-term sustainability of
the pension system. The government has formed an inter-ministerial task force to guide the
work on reforming the pay-as-you-go pension systems for employees, farmers, and
self-employed. To improve the financial position of the pension system over the medium
term, the task force has examined ways to further improve pension legislation, including
through de-linking pensions from wages, accelerating the increase in the retirement age, and
equalizing the retirement age for men and women. As a result, to reduce the structural deficit
of the pension system over time, the government will, before end-June, make a formal
decision (a prior action for completion of the fifth review) to (i) increase the retirement age
by 2 years (to 65 years for men and 60 years for women), phased-in in four years; (ii) phase
in inflation-based indexation for post-retirement pension benefits (instead of 50 percent wage
and 50 percent inflation) in four years (in four equal annual increases in the inflation
coefficient); (iii) replace quarterly with annual indexation of pensions; and (iv) keep the
current indexation system for pre-entitlement pension calculations. It will also review the
current supplemental entitlement system (bonus) for specific professions, with a view to
ensuring its fairness. Enactment by parliament of the revised legislation, after consultation
with Fund and World Bank staff, will be a structural PC for end-October 2005.

- 61 -

APPENDIX III

Concurrently, the government will benefit from World Bank assistance to strengthen pension
administration. As agreed earlier, plans for the clearance of one-half month of the Employee
Pension Fund arrears in 2005 will be made conditional on the overall budgetary revenue
performance and, if needed, will be delayed by one year. In any case, this payment will not
be made before Q4 2005.
22.
To support the fiscal consolidation into the medium term, the government will
broaden its expenditure reform beyond the civil service and pension. In particular,
spending on social programs will need to be better targeted to those who are most in need. In
this connection, it will request technical assistance from the World Bank and the Fund to
assess the effectiveness of current social programs with a view to identifying cost savings
and eliminating duplicative services, which it will seek to incorporate in the 2006 budget.
23.
Further improvements in public expenditure management are essential to the
goal of fiscal consolidation. To improve budget management, the government will place all
spending programs under a unified budgetary framework starting in 2006. To this end, it will
set up an inter-ministerial group to coordinate all capital investment budgets that are financed
by foreign loans. Beginning with the 2006 budget, these investment programs would be fully
integrated in the budget planning process. To evaluate the fiscal risks associated with publicprivate partnerships (PPP) in investment and their potential macroeconomic impact, the
government has requested technical assistance from the Fund. As agreed, the government
remains committed to closing off accounts of the indirect budget users and incorporating the
spending programs currently financed from such accounts into the budget. As a first concrete
step towards achieving this goal, the government will submit appropriate amendments to the
Law on Budget System and the Law on Foreign Exchange by end-June 2005. In early-May
2005, the accounts of the Ministry of Defense were incorporated into the treasury single
account (TSA); the last remaining budget user (Ministry of International Affairs) will be
brought under the TSA by December 2005.
24.
The government will make better use of the capabilities and services of Public
Payment Agency (PPA) to improve fiscal management. The action plan to incorporate the
PPA into the Treasury was issued in March, in line with the program commitment. With its
technical capabilities and as the main agency servicing local budgets, the PPA is suitably
placed to develop a software module for recording local budget expenditures on a
GFS-consistent basis in order to shorten the reporting lag of local budget statistics. Such a
program will be developed for implementation by June 2005 for the four largest local
municipalities and will eventually be extended to all local government budgets. As part of a
broader effort to improve the public expenditure management, the Ministry of Finance will
seek Fund assistance to assess the adequacy of fiscal management in Serbia by requesting
participation in the fiscal Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC).
25.
Public debt management functions will be further strengthened. The debt
management function will be retained in the Treasury. While the Treasury develops its
expertise, debt registration and servicing functions should continue to remain in the NBS,
which will integrate its domestic and external debt registration in a single database to allow

- 62 -

APPENDIX III

for consolidated reporting on the debt portfolio. The Treasury should move rapidly toward
full integration of cash and debt management, which will be particularly timely given the
expected large inflows of privatization proceeds in the coming months. In addition, the
development of the T-bill market will be fully coordinated with the NBS. The government
has submitted to Parliament a draft law on Public Debt; however, it will not issue foreign
currency debt this year.
Montenegro
26.
In 2005, the government will reduce the deficit of the consolidated general
government to 2.7 percent of Montenegrin GDP to further strengthen macroeconomic
stability. To secure the deficit target, and reflecting improved collection of contributions to
the social funds, the government will reduce its transfers to the Pension Fund and increase
reserves by €5 million. It will withdraw all deposits with commercial banks that do not serve
as collateral for loan programs (similarly, the privatization proceeds allocated to the
Restitution Fund will be transferred to an account at the central bank) by end-June 2005
(structural benchmark). Remaining deposits will be transferred to the Treasury as the
respective loans mature with a view to eliminating all government commercial banks
deposits by end-2005. Civil service reform efforts will be stepped up to reach the original
expenditure reduction target for budget-financed employment of 4,200 for the fiscal years
2004 and 2005. By end-June 2005 the government will prepare an inventory of spending
arrears of the consolidated budget and adopt a schedule for arrears clearance (structural
benchmark). To strengthen control over the fiscal position of the consolidated public sector,
the government will issue a decree by end-June to unify the charts of accounts of the central
government, municipalities, and extrabudgetary funds.
27.
Higher-than-budgeted privatization receipts will be used mainly to reduce debt
and build up reserves. The government currently expects proceeds of €164 million in 2005,
which will be used to reduce the domestic debt by about €50 million by retiring the debt to
domestic banks and amortizing T-bills falling due in 2005. The remainder and any additional
privatization proceeds will be deposited in the central bank to increase reserves. The
government will consider additional investment spending only after preparing a mediumterm public investment program and updating debt and asset management strategies, in
consultation with Fund staff. The government has requested technical assistance to this end.
The increase in investment spending will be discussed in the context of sixth program review
and will be conditioned on strong macroeconomic performance, continued progress in
structural reforms and privatization, cuts in current spending, and a satisfactory revenue
performance and no new tax cuts.
B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
28.
The monetary program for 2005 envisages a tightening of monetary conditions
to help contain domestic demand and inflationary pressures. For 2005, the revised
monetary program provides for an increase in end-period NFA by US$768 million, with
monthly average NDA declining to SRD -82.9 billion, and a real decline in reserve money by

- 63 -

APPENDIX III

8.2 percent. Broad money is projected to rise by 22.4 percent. The NBS will stand ready to
sterilize higher-than-programmed foreign exchange inflows as needed to contain credit
expansion.
29.
The reliance on indirect monetary instruments will increase. The NBS will assess
by mid-June 2005, in close cooperation with Fund staff, the feasibility of establishing an
interest rate corridor, which would link the interest rates on the NBS deposit facility and on
the three lending facilities to market conditions. In this context, the NBS will also consider
streamlining the three NBS lending facilities with a view to creating a lender-of-last resort
facility in line with international practices. In addition, the NBS is preparing for two-way
repo operations to allow the NBS to inject liquidity into the market if necessary, including
through very short term repos. The monthly average volume of repo transactions operations
will increase from a stock of SRD 2,584 million in March 2005 to at least SRD 6.5 billion in
June, SRD 7.5 billion in September, and SRD 8.0 billion in November 2005. Moreover, the
NBS envisages outright sales of government bonds, with an amount of SRD 1 billion being
offered in the third quarter and another SRD 1 billion in the fourth quarter to reduce
structural excess liquidity in the money market and help establish a secondary market for
these securities.
30.
The use of prudential measures to contain macroeconomic and prudential risks
resulting from rapid credit growth will continue:
•

Effective June 10, 2005, statutory reserve requirements (SRR) on enterprises’
foreign-currency deposits and on commercial banks’ foreign borrowing will be
increased from 21 percent to 26 percent (a prior action for completion of the fifth
review). At the same time, SRR on dinar deposits will be reduced from 21 percent to
20 percent to help contain euroization by increasing the wedge between SRR on
dinar-denominated and foreign currency-denominated deposits.

•

The NBS will issue by end-May 2005 a decision requiring the Board of Directors of
commercial banks to approve specific risk monitoring and risk management policies
with respect to credit risk resulting from borrowers’ exposure to exchange-rate risk
by, inter alia, assessing borrowers’ ability to service loans—most of which are
indexed to the euro—in the event of exchange rate changes and by considering the
results of these assessments in determining the appropriate loan classification.

•

By end-July 2005, the Law on Leasing and the Law on the NBS will be amended
with a view to grant the authority for regulating and supervising leasing companies to
the NBS (structural benchmark). On this basis, the NBS will issue by-laws
(a) introducing a minimum value of leasing contracts; and (b) applying the same
ratios already applied to consumer loans also to leasing contracts (20 percent
minimum downpayment and 30 percent maximum monthly payment-to-net income
ratio).

- 64 -

•

APPENDIX III

The NBS and the government will support the private credit bureau established in
2004 in charge of monitoring individual’s credit risk exposure and payment history.
They will also strengthen the legal framework, in accordance with EU Directives, to
ensure that the privacy of borrowers’ personal data is protected. By end-May 2005,
the credit bureau’s data base will be extended to comprise data on leasing activities,
tax arrears and arrears to utilities, and lending to enterprises.

31.
Exchange rate policy will continue to balance the objectives of reducing inflation
and containing the current account deficit. Against the background of the recent surge in
inflation, exchange rate policy will aim at strengthening confidence in the dinar by
contributing to reducing inflation, while at the same time striving to ensure external
competitiveness. Exchange rate policy will be assessed frequently in light of current account,
wage, and inflation developments.
C. Bank Reform and Financial Sector Supervision
32.
A new banking law in Serbia will substantially strengthen the regulatory and
supervisory environment. Parliamentary approval of the new banking law in line with the
recommendations of the recent FSAP mission is expected by mid-November 2005 (a
structural PC). The new law will:
•

Ensure that accurate and timely asset classifications are applied and reported to the
NBS.

•

Authorize the NBS to supervise banks on a consolidated basis.

•

Establish explicit statutory protection for NBS staff when performing their duties in
good faith in accordance with the law.

•

Reduce the significant ownership level criterion for prior approval by the NBS from
15 percent of bank capital to 5 percent.

•

Set limits for banks’ aggregate exposures to related parties at the level of at most
20 percent of bank capital in line with EU directives.

•

Strengthen the “fit-and-proper” criteria for the members of the banks’ boards of
directors and supervisory boards and for significant shareholders.

•

Revise the criteria for loan loss provisions to minimize the number of exceptional
reductions in required provisions.

•

Require banks’ boards of directors to accept responsibility for establishing and
overseeing integrated risk management systems. In this context, the NBS will be
empowered to apply remedial actions in the event of financial misreporting.

33.
The NBS will further strengthen on-site and off-site supervision. The NBS is
committed to withdraw the license of banks failing to meet the minimum capital requirement.
As part of its Supervisory Development Plan, the NBS will also adopt a time bound
corrective action plan to address Basel Core Principle deficiencies identified by the recent

- 65 -

APPENDIX III

FSAP mission. In addition, the NBS will act decisively to eliminate regulatory forbearance in
other areas, inter alia with respect to protracted breaches of the limits for banks’ credit
exposures to shareholders and their associates. With a view to increase the quality of on-site
inspections, the NBS will hire new staff and step up internal and external training. The NBS
will conduct regular full-scope examinations of the two systemically important
state-controlled banks and—as for all banks examined—ensure the timely adoption of the
resulting recommendations. To further improve the off-site inspection capacity, the NBS data
gathering capabilities will be strengthened, including through reporting requirements on all
foreign currency-denominated and foreign currency-indexed assets and liabilities. To
improve financial sector transparency and market discipline, all banks will publish the full
audited IAS/IFRS compliant end-2004 audit reports, supporting documents, and auditor’s
opinions by mid-July 2005.
34.
Insurance supervision will also be strengthened. The NBS will require
comprehensive year-end audits, with management letters provided to the NBS for all
insurance companies. In this context, the NBS will ensure that IAS/IFRS and NBS
accounting rules are fully applied to fixed assets and accounts receivable. To facilitate the
reduction of state influence in the insurance sector and improve financial discipline, the
government has submitted to Parliament amendments to the BRA law and the insurance law
assigning responsibility for the privatization and bankruptcy of insurance companies to the
BRA. As a major contribution to the restructuring of the insurance sector, upon passage of
the respective legislative amendments, the government will launch by end-July 2005 a
transparent international tender for the appointment of a financial advisor for the
privatization of the second-largest socially-owned insurance company DDOR (structural
benchmark). By end-May 2005, the NBS will initiate its on-site examination of DDOR.
Moreover, for the largest socially owned insurance company Dunav, the BRA will, upon
passage of the amendments to the BRA law, launch a tender by end-July 2005 for an
independent diagnostic report. Based on the findings of this report, the government will
adopt a time-bound corrective action plan by end-November 2005 (structural benchmark). In
the second half of 2005, the NBS will also commence an on-site inspection of Dunav.
35.
The momentum in bank privatization will be maintained. For Vojvođanska
Banka, an invitation for the submission of expression of interest will be launched by endSeptember 2005 (structural benchmark). Binding bids were due on May 16 for Novosadska
Banka and Continental Banka, and end-July for Niska Banka. Moreover, the government is
committed to offering by end-December 2005 its stakes in all majority-state-owned banks
(Panonska Banka and Credy Banka) that were comprised in the BRA portfolio as of end2004, with the exception of Privredna Banka Pancevo, for which the privatization tender will
be launched in 2006. Concurrently, with bilateral assistance, the BRA will further strengthen
its reporting requirements, control mechanisms, and governance in other banks equity
holdings to preserve their value prior to resolution. After significant delays, the BRA will
publish by mid-May a schedule for the sale of unimpaired nonperforming loans and equities
with range-of-value estimates. The first sale of such assets will be launched by end-May.
Finally, the deposit insurance, bank liquidation, and Bank Rehabilitation Agency laws will be
enacted by Parliament by end-July 2005 (structural benchmark).

- 66 -

APPENDIX III

36.
In Montenegro, strong efforts will be made to increase efficiency in the banking
industry. A tender for a majority stake in Podgoricka Banka will be issued by end-June 2005
(structural benchmark). The government aims at combining the direct and indirect stateholdings in another two banks (in Plevaljska by end-June, and in Nikšićka by endSeptember 2005) to be able to offer majority packages to strategic investors. A new
insurance law, which will open up the commercial insurance business to international
competition, was passed by Parliament in end-April 2005.
D. Enterprise Sector
37.
In Serbia, the wage bill in state enterprises will continue to be controlled to
contain inflation pressures and encourage restructuring. To help ensure that the state
enterprise wage bill remains under control, the government passed in November 2004 a
decree requiring ex ante approval by the Ministries of Labor and Finance for wage increases
in the eight monitored public enterprises.2 In 2005, the aggregate wage bill in these
enterprises will be allowed to grow only by 7 percent on an annual average basis (the wage
bill ceilings for end-June and end-September 2005 are PCs; in the event of spin-offs as a
result of restructuring, the wage bill envelope will be adjusted downward for the wage bills
of the spun-off units). The government approved detailed business plans in April 2005,
which include plans for reducing employment. Redundancy payments for the laid-off
workers will be paid from the non-wage enterprise budgets, the Transition Fund, or the
budgetary reserve.
38.
Privatizing and restructuring socially owned enterprises—key to improving
export performance, strengthening growth, and offering solid employment
opportunities—will continue. The Serbian government’s objective is to offer all remaining
socially owned enterprises for sale at least once by end-2006. Specifically:
•

Between January 1-June 30, 2005, at least 130 companies will be offered for sale
through auctions (structural benchmark), with a success rate of at least 40 percent.
Between January 1-September 30, at least 230 companies will be offered through that
channel (structural benchmark), with a similar success rate. For the year 2005 as a
whole, the Privatization Agency (PA) plans to offer at least 320 companies for sale
through auctions, and the government will provide it with an additional €5 million as
needed to achieve this objective.

•

The PA will offer for sale 7 socially owned enterprises, of which 4 from the list of
companies under restructuring, through tenders during the second quarter of 2005
(structural benchmark). It will offer for sale another 7 companies, of which 4 from
the list of companies under restructuring, through tenders between July 1–October 30,
2005 (structural benchmark).

2

These are the electricity, petroleum, railway, postal, telecommunication, airline, airport, and forestry
companies.

- 67 -

APPENDIX III

•

To accelerate sales of residual state-owned shares in socially owned enterprises from
the Share Fund (through public offers or sales via the stock exchange), amendments
to the Share Fund law were passed in May. Moreover, to increase the depth of the
market, it will also submit to parliament new laws on securities, investment funds,
and voluntary pensions by end-June 2005. In the meantime, 45 such transactions were
conducted in the first quarter of 2005, and another 90 are expected in the period
covering the second and third quarters, with a view to achieving 200 offerings by the
end of the year.

•

To ensure fiscal transparency, all privatization proceeds will be treated as budgetary
financing (below the line).

39.
To accelerate privatization, the Serbian government envisages debt workouts for
large socially owned enterprises. The framework for such agreements will be strengthened
through amendments to the Privatization Law, which were approved by Parliament in late
May (a prior action for completion of the fifth review), enshrining the principle of write-offs
of enterprise debt to state creditors and public utilities, conditional upon privatization.
Immediately after its passage by parliament, the government will enact the necessary
ordinances to implement the law. The new framework will significantly accelerate the
process of preparing companies under restructuring for sale, and will allow the reoffering of
companies that were offered unsuccessfully. After passage of the law, the government will
follow a policy of initiating bankruptcy procedures within three months against those socially
owned enterprises that failed twice to be sold through auctions or tenders.
40.
The government is moving ahead with setting up an effective bankruptcy
process and will use it with determination to strengthen financial discipline. The
bankruptcy process will become fully operational by end-June 2005, following the adoption
of bylaws to the Bankruptcy Law and the establishment of (a) a Supervisory Body to license,
supervise, and regulate bankruptcy trustees; and (b) a specialized unit within the PA to act as
bankruptcy trustee for state- and socially owned enterprises. The new Supervisory Body will
start licensing trustees in July 2005. To give credibility to the new bankruptcy legislation and
improve financial discipline by creating a strong precedent, the government initiated in April
bankruptcy procedures under the new regulations against 3 heavily indebted, loss-making
socially owned companies from the list of companies under restructuring. Creditors initiated
procedures against 15 other companies under the new framework (in addition to the
17 companies in bankruptcy already under administration of the PA under the previous
legislation). The government will continue this policy by initiating bankruptcy procedures
against at least another 5 large socially owned enterprises between June-September 2005
(structural benchmark).
41.
The Serbian government is firmly committed to improving the financial
performance of the railway company (ZTP) by accelerating restructuring and
downsizing employment. Delays in restructuring, and excessive employment, have created
large losses and imposed a substantial budgetary burden through annual subsidies (½ of
one percent of GDP in 2005). Against this background, the Ministry of Capital Investment

- 68 -

APPENDIX III

has prepared both a one-year business plan and a restructuring plan for the period 2005-09
drawing on the plan elaborated by a consulting company. The one-year business plan, which
was approved by the government and already implemented in part, provides detailed plans
for 2005 for (a) reducing employment; (b) undertaking preparatory activities to allow for the
spinning off of all non-core activities by offering them for sale to private investors (one spunoff unit that primarily employs handicapped persons is not slated for privatization); and (c)
potentially withdrawing service and/or closing loss-making railway lines, if service-specific
Public Service Contracts that fully compensate ZTP for the losses incurred in providing the
services are not agreed. The company has made good progress in all three areas, and will
reduce employment by 1,900 by end-September. The restructuring plan provides the detailed
timetable for the continuation of these activities during 2005-09, and will be approved by the
government by end-June 2005. Moreover, parliament approved in February 2005 a
transportation law prepared by the government in consultation with the World Bank that
provides for the unbundling of ZTP into separate infrastructure, freight transport, passenger
transport, and rolling stock maintenance companies.
42.
The Serbian government will continue restructuring public utilities and other
state-owned companies based on strategic plans.
•

Following the enactment of the energy law in 2004, an independent energy regulator
was established, which will become fully operational by end-May 2005. As a first
step, it will issue tariff methodologies by end-October 2005.

•

The government will effectively unbundle the electricity company Elektroprivreda
Srbije (EPS) into two separate companies, one for power generation, distribution, and
distribution system management, and one for transmission and dispatch by legally
registering the new transmission and dispatch company before July 15, 2005 (a
structural PC), and by ensuring that the two companies function as independent
enterprises by January 1, 2006. In addition, EPS will (i) complete the spin-off of all
non-core activities; (ii) reduce its core employment by 2,750 (relative to endDecember 2004), in line with the company’s strategic plan; (iii) service all its debt to
the government in full except for Kosovo-related debt; and (iv) not receive any
budgetary subsidy in 2005.

•

Legislation supporting the unbundling of the oil and gas company Naftna Industrija
Srbije (NIS) into four separate companies (dealing with gas; oil exploration and
research; oil refining and distribution; and non-core activities) will be passed by
Parliament by end-July 2005 (a structural PC). The government will request by endMay 2005 technical assistance from the World Bank for assessing the appropriate
sequencing of steps to privatize the four companies, including a schedule for
removing the protection for the refineries (in particular by abolishing the NIS
monopoly for importing oil derivatives and by liberalizing end-consumer prices).
Based on these findings, it will launch by end-July 2005 (structural benchmark) an
international tender to hire an advisor for the privatization of NIS, including advice
on selling a majority stake in the two refineries in early 2006. Before issuing the

- 69 -

APPENDIX III

tender, the terms of reference of the advisor will be reviewed by Fund and World
Bank staff.
•

By June 22, 2005, 33 companies, non-core assets, and hotels and recreational
establishments of the 8 monitored state-owned enterprises will be spun off, registered
as separate companies, and transferred to the PA for privatization (the TMU,
Section K, lists 8 non-core companies of EPS and 25 others under the first group of
companies) (a prior action for completion of the fifth review). By endSeptember 2005, 65 companies, non-core assets, and hotels and recreational
establishments of the 8 monitored state-owned enterprises (the TMU, Section K, lists
30 hotels and recreational establishments of EPS, 11 companies or non-core assets of
EPS, and 24 companies or non-core assets of the other state-owned enterprises under
the second group of companies) will be spun-off, registered as separate companies,
and transferred to the PA (a structural PC). Finally, all the remaining companies,
non-core assets, and hotels and recreational establishments of the 8 monitored stateowned enterprises (the TMU, Section K, lists 6 companies and non-core assets of
EPS under the third group of companies) will be spun-off, registered as separate
companies, and transferred to the PA by end-October 2005 (a structural PC).

•

The government will, after close consultation with World Bank staff, adopt by endJune 2005 a restructuring plan for the mining company RTB Bor (structural
benchmark). This plan will include time-bound actions with respect to resolution of
all constituent parts, including core and non-core businesses, labor reductions,
privatization, and environmental remediation.

•

To raise transparency in the sector, all monitored public utilities will publish by
end-June 2005 an auditor’s report on their 2004 accounts in line with IAS prepared by
a reputable international auditing firm engaging a review partner with relevant
industry experience from outside the local office.

43.
To enhance collection and harden budget constraints of state- and socially
owned enterprises, public utilities will enforce penalties on late payments and cut off
supplies to commercial users that are not honoring their payment obligations for more
than two months. If the government considers that continuation of delivery to these
enterprises is imperative for strategic or social reasons, the utility bills will be paid from the
budget. In 2005, the two largest primary energy suppliers EPS and NIS, both state-owned
companies, will make strong efforts to improve collections of current bills and arrears. In
particular, the collection rate on current deliveries of EPS (including collection of arrears)
will increase from 89.5 percent on average in 2004 to at least 92.3 percent in 2005, with
intermediate targets set for June, September, and December 2005 (indicative targets). For
NIS, the same collection rate will increase during the year to 100.3 percent on average, with
intermediate targets set for June, September, and December 2005 (indicative targets).
44.
Privatization in Montenegro will be further accelerated to attract international
investment and management expertise. The government will offer for sale in 2005 through

- 70 -

APPENDIX III

transparent public tenders the tobacco industry, a lottery company, and three large hotels.
Furthermore, the privatization strategies for EPCG (electricity company), the port of Bar, the
railroad, and Plantaže (winery) will be finalized by end-2005.
E. Foreign Trade System
45.
Serbia and Montenegro largely conduct their foreign trade systems and customs
operations separately, in line with the “twin track” approach recently adopted by the
EU. In Serbia, the government is preparing a foreign trade law which sets the framework for
international trade consistently with WTO and EU regulations, and on a custom tariffs law,
which will harmonize tariff lines according to HS 2000/2002 standards and the EU combined
nomenclature. The latter law will also revisit some tariff rates to bring them more in line with
the structure of the economy. Largely as a result of the increase in tariff lines, the simple
average tariff will increase by slightly more than 1 percent, to 8.7 percent, but the weighted
average tariff will remain at 6.3 percent. A foreign trade law, compliant with international
standards, has been implemented in Montenegro since April 2004. The resolution of the
outstanding issues with the EC relating to sugar trade has allowed the resumption of sugar
exports to the EU, even though, starting July 2005, tariff quotas are expected to be applied in
the context of the new EU regulation of the sugar market. Furthermore, Serbia has signed a
trade agreement to liberalize trade in textiles with the EU.
46.
Discussions on bilateral Free Trade Agreements with neighboring countries
within the initiative of the Stability Pact—aimed at facilitating trade through
harmonized rules and standards and simplified customs procedures—have progressed
well. Free Trade agreements with Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia,
Moldova, and Romania have been ratified and implemented, while work is underway to
review the trade agreement with Macedonia. In this regard, the government is committed to
work towards a resolution of the ongoing trade dispute with Bosnia-Herzegovina regarding
Serbian agricultural exports. In February 2005, the World Trade Organization approved the
separate accession of the two republics, and distinct Working Parties are expected to meet in
the coming months. In this context, Serbia plans to improve its administrative capacity to
implement WTO-related measures. Customs operations are expected to be further
strengthened. To avoid backtracking on reforms and maintain a competitive market
environment, both member states will refrain from introducing or intensifying import
restrictions. Serbia and Montenegro agree to improve the comparability of respective external
sector data, and provide foreign debt data on a periodic basis.
III. PROGRAM MONITORING
47.
Macroeconomic policy performance will continue to be monitored through
quarterly quantitative performance criteria and indicative targets (Annex A). Quarterly
PCs are set for end-June and end-September 2005, as specified in Annex A. Progress in
structural reform will be monitored through structural PCs and benchmarks on key policy
measures, listed in Annex C along with prior actions for completion of the fifth review.

ANNEX A

1/ Quantitative performance criteria and indicative targets are defined in Annex E and evaluated—for program purposes—at end-December 2003 exchange rates for December 2004 and March 2005,
and at end-December 2004 exchange rates for June and September 2005. In 2005, figures in section A. are performance criteria for March, June, and September and indicative targets for December.
2/ The end-2004 performance criteria were adjusted by the amount that actual data differed from the estimates for December 2003.
3/ In millions of U.S. dollars. The net foreign assets floor will be adjusted downward by the shortfall relative to the programed level of net external budgetary financing with a maximum adjustment of US$100 million.
4/ Monitored on the basis of monthly averages as defined in Annex E. Subject to the same adjustment for excess or shortfall in combined budgetary external financing
and privatization proceeds for the consolidated Serbian government as defined in 7/.
5/ For program purposes, the ceilings on net credit of the banking system to the consolidated general government will be adjusted downward by the cumulative
increase in the stock of government debt held by the nonbank public (other than that related to the frozen currency deposits), starting from January 1, 2004, and
upward for any decrease. In addition, in the event of a shortfall in the sum of net foreign budgetary financing and privatization proceeds, the ceilings will be adjusted upward
for the shortfall subject to the total adjustment limit of 6 billion dinar for Serbia and € 10 million for Montenegro's consolidated government. The ceilings will be adjusted
downward for the excess of combined net external budgetary financing and privatization proceeds relative to budgeted levels that are not used (1) to reduce the government
external indebtedness by more than envisaged under the program, or (2) to cover investment and restructuring costs in consultation with the Fund in the context of program reviews.
6/ The adjustors for shortfalls in (i) nonbank domestic financing; and (ii) severance payments apply, as defined in sections II.D, and II.J of the TMU, respectively.
7/ The consolidated general government comprises the Serbian republican and local governments, union level operations, the Montenegrin republican
government, the Serbian and Montenegrin social security funds, and the Serbian and Montenegro special extrabudgetary programs as defined in the TMU.

ownership transfer on the basis of the amendment to the privatizaation law adopted by Parliament on May 23, 2005; also excludes indebtedness arising from the fulfillment of existing government guarantees.
11/ Excludes debts subject to restructuring/negotiations. The nonaccumulation of new external arrears is also a continuous performance criterion.
12/ In 2004, the 7 monitored enterprises were JP Elektroprivreda Srbije, JP Naftna Industrija Srbije, JP PTT Srbije, JP Jugoslovenski Aerotransport, JP Zelenicko Transportno Preduzece Srbije,
JP Srbija Sume, and JP Srbija Telekom. For 2005, JP Aerodrom Beograd was added to this list. In the case of spin-offs of activities from these companies through the creation of new companies
the wage bill target will be adjusted downwards for the wage bill of the spun-off units. Targets are cumulative since the beginning of the respective year.
13/ Consolidated Montenegrin government includes all entities in Montenegro defined under 7/; the rest of entities under 7/ is included in the consolidated Serbian government.
14/ Foreign currency-denominated loans and deposits at program exchange rates, i.e. end-2003 exchange rates for December 2004 and March 2005 and end-2004 exchange rates for the remainder of 2005.

APPENDIX III
ANNEX D

SERBIA AND MONTENEGRO: TECHNICAL MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
I. INTRODUCTION
1.
This memorandum replaces the Technical Memorandum of Understanding attached
to the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies of November 29, 2004. It sets out
the understandings regarding the definitions of quantitative and structural performance
criteria, benchmarks, and indicative targets for the program supported by the Fund under an
Extended Arrangement (EA), as well as the related reporting requirements. The key changes
in this updated memorandum include definitional changes in the external debt ceilings and
data revisions.
2.
To monitor developments under the program, the authorities will provide the data
listed in each section below to the European Department of the Fund, in accordance with the
indicated timing. The quantitative performance criteria and indicative targets will be
monitored on the basis of the methodological classification of monetary and financial data
that was in place on December 31, 2002, except as noted below. Quantitative performance
criteria and indicative targets for end-June, end-September and end-December 2005 are
specified in Annex A of the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP).
3.
For program purposes, the public sector consists of the consolidated general
government (comprising union operations, Serbian state and local governments, the
Montenegrin state government, the Serbian and Montenegrin social security funds, and the
Serbian and Montenegrin special budgetary programs), the National Bank of Serbia (NBS),
and the Central Bank of Montenegro (CBM). For consistency with previous years, the
Serbian state government will be defined to include the Road Directorate, even after it is
corporatized, which is envisaged for mid-2005. The authorities will inform the Fund staff of
any new funds or special extrabudgetary programs that may be created during the program
period to carry out operations of a fiscal nature as defined in the IMF’s 2001 Manual on
Government Financial Statistics, and will ensure that these will be incorporated within the
definition of consolidated general government.
II. QUANTITATIVE CRITERIA: DEFINITIONS AND REPORTING STANDARDS
A. Floor for Net Foreign Assets of the NBS and Program Exchange Rates
4.
Definition. Net foreign assets (NFA) of the NBS consist of foreign reserve assets
minus foreign reserve liabilities.
•

For purposes of the program, foreign reserve assets shall be defined as monetary
gold, holdings of SDRs, the reserve position in the IMF, and NBS holdings of foreign
exchange in convertible currencies. Any such assets shall only be included as foreign
reserve assets if they are under the effective control of, and readily available to, the
NBS. In particular, excluded from foreign reserve assets are: frozen assets of the
Union of Serbia and Montenegro (SM), undivided assets of the former Socialist

- 77 -

APPENDIX III
ANNEX D

Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY), long-term assets, NBS claims on resident
banks and nonbanks, as well as subsidiaries or branches of SM commercial banks
located abroad, any assets in nonconvertible currencies, encumbered reserve assets
(e.g., pledged as collateral for foreign loans or through forward contracts), and
precious metals other than monetary gold. For program purposes, all euro and foreign
currency-related assets will be evaluated at program exchange rates: For 2004 and
for the period January 1, 2005-March 31, 2005, the program exchange rates are those
that prevailed on December 31, 2003. In particular, US$1 = SRD 54.6372, €1 =
SRD 68.3129, and SDR1 = US$ 1.4806. For the remainder of 2005, the program
exchange rates are those that prevailed on December 31, 2004; in particular, US$1 =
SRD 57.9355, €1 = SRD 78.8850, and SDR1 = US$ 1.55301. Monetary gold shall be
valued at an accounting price of US$ 416.85 per ounce. On December 31, 2004, the
NBS’s foreign reserve assets as defined above amounted to US$3,998.0 million,
including gold valued at US$148.8 million.
•

For purposes of the program, foreign reserve liabilities shall be defined as any
foreign-currency-denominated short-term loan or deposit (with a maturity of up to
and including one year); NBS liabilities to residents and nonresidents associated with
swaps (including any portion of the NBS gold that is collateralized) and forward
contracts; IMF purchases; and loans contracted by the NBS from international capital
markets, banks or other financial institutions located abroad, and foreign
governments, irrespective of their maturity. Undivided foreign exchange liabilities of
SFRY are excluded. On December 31, 2004, the NBS’s foreign reserve liabilities, as
defined above, to nonresidents were US$1,099 million and to residents were
US$1,058 million.

•

For 2004 and for the period January 1, 2005-March 31, 2005, all assets and liabilities
denominated in convertible currencies other than the U.S. dollar shall be converted at
their respective exchange rates against the U.S. dollar prevailing on
December 31, 2003. For the remainder of 2005, the conversion will be based on the
respective exchange rates against the U.S. dollar prevailing on December 31, 2004.
All changes in definition or in valuation of assets or liabilities, as well as details of
operations concerning sales, purchases or swap operations with respect to gold shall
be communicated to the Fund staff within one week of the operation.

5.
Reporting. Data on foreign reserve assets and foreign reserve liabilities of the NBS
shall be transmitted to the European Department of the Fund on a weekly basis within four
business days of the end of each business week. To facilitate program monitoring, the NBS
will provide the data at the indicated constant prices and exchange rates, as well as at current
exchange rates. The NBS will report if any of the reported foreign reserve assets are illiquid,
pledged, swapped, or encumbered.
6.
Adjustors. For program purposes, net foreign assets will be adjusted upward pari
passu to the extent that: (i) after December 31, 2004, the NBS has recovered frozen assets of
the FRY, assets of the SFRY, long-term assets, and foreign-exchange-denominated claims on

- 78 -

APPENDIX III
ANNEX D

resident banks and nonbanks, as well as SM commercial banks abroad; and (ii) the
restructuring of the banking sector by the Agency for Deposit Insurance, Rehabilitation,
Bankruptcy, and Liquidation of Banks (BRA) involves a write-off of NBS foreign exchangedenominated liabilities to resident banks. The net foreign assets floor will be adjusted
downward by the shortfall relative to the programmed level of net external budgetary
financing cumulative from December 31, 2004 (US$18.4 million through end-June 2005,
US$97.7 million through end-September 2005, and US$140.9 million through endDecember 2005) with a maximum adjustment of US$100 million. The net foreign assets
floor will also be adjusted by the amount that the end-December 2004 outcome is revised.
B. Ceiling on Net Domestic Assets of the NBS
7.
Definition. For purposes of the program, net domestic assets (NDA) of the NBS are
defined as the difference between reserve money (as defined in section F) and net foreign
assets (as defined in section A), with the latter being converted from U.S. dollars into dinars
at the program exchange rates as specified above. The ceiling is established as the monthly
average of each month with an end-month test date (i.e., the averages of June, September,
and December 2005, respectively). The monthly average of NDA for program purposes will
be calculated as the difference of the monthly average of reserve money and monthly average
of NFA. The monthly average of NFA will be adjusted so that the disbursements of World
Bank program loans and EU macro-financial assistance are counted as if they occurred on the
first day of the month in which they were effected. As of December 31, 2004, NDA of the
NBS so defined were valued at SRD -28,485 million (Annex B).
8.
Adjustors. The NBS's NDA ceiling is subject to the same adjustor for excess or
shortfall in combined budgetary external financing and privatization proceeds for the
consolidated Serbian government as defined in Section C, except that the limit for upward
adjustment is SRD 2.5 billion. The adjustment for excesses/shortfalls in combined budgetary
external financing and privatization proceeds is asymmetric: (a) it applies to the NDA ceiling
but not to the NFA floor (except that shortfalls in budgetary external financing trigger an
equal downward adjustment in NFA up to a limit of US$100 million); and (b) upward
adjustments in NDA are capped at the equivalent of 0.2 percent of programmed annual GDP,
while no limits apply to downward adjustments. This treatment takes into account that:
(a) privatization proceeds reflect partly sales to residents (i.e., not directly affecting NFA), so
that a downward adjustment in NDA in response to higher than programmed privatization
proceeds may not necessarily lead to a corresponding increase in NFA or may do so with a
considerable lag (money demand is not stable in the short run); and (b) the need to safeguard
foreign reserves.
9.
Reporting. The ceilings will be monitored on the basis of daily data on NBS foreign
reserve assets and liabilities as defined under section A, and reserve money (as defined under
section F), supplied to the European Department of the Fund by the NBS within four
business days of the end of each business week. To facilitate program monitoring, the NBS
will provide daily its foreign reserves liabilities, as well as the amounts and dates of World

- 79 -

APPENDIX III
ANNEX D

Bank and EU macro-financial assistance disbursements at the current and the program
exchange rates.
C. Ceiling on the Net Credit of the Banking System to the Consolidated General
Government
10.
Definition. The banking system comprises the NBS and commercial banks licensed
by it in Serbia, as well as the CBM and commercial banks licensed by it in Montenegro. The
consolidated general government was defined above.
•

For program purposes, net credit of the banking system to the consolidated
general government is defined as all claims other than frozen foreign currency
deposit (FFCD), bonds (i.e., credits, securities, and other claims in both dinar and
foreign currencies) of the banking system on the consolidated general government
less all deposits of the consolidated general government with the banking system,
including foreign currency deposits. Foreign currency deposits and foreign-currencydenominated credits to the general government will be reported at the program
exchange rates. Net bank credit to the consolidated general government in
Montenegro will be monitored on the basis of data supplied by the Montenegrin
authorities; at end-December 2004, net credit of the banking system in Montenegro to
the consolidated general government in Montenegro amounted to €11.97 million
(equivalent to SRD 818 million). At end-December 2004, net credit of the banking
system to the consolidated general government so defined was SRD -19,106 million.

11.
Reporting. The ceilings will be monitored using end-month data on the accounts of
the banking system supplied to the European Department of the Fund with a lag not to
exceed three weeks.
12.
Adjustors. For program purposes, the ceilings on net credit of the banking system to
the consolidated general governments will be adjusted downward by the cumulative increase
in the stock of government debt held by the nonbank public (other than that related to the
frozen foreign currency deposits), starting from January 1, 2004, and upward for any
decrease. These performance criteria will be adjusted by the amount that the endDecember 2004 outcome is revised. In addition, in the event of a shortfall in the sum of net
foreign budgetary financing and privatization proceeds, the ceilings will be adjusted upward
by 75 percent of the shortfall subject to the total adjustment limit of SRD 6 billion for
Serbia’s and €11 million for Montenegro’s consolidated government. The ceilings will be
adjusted downward for the excess of combined net external budgetary financing and
privatization proceeds relative to budgeted levels that are not used (1) to reduce the
government’s external indebtedness by more than envisaged under the program, or (2) to
cover investment and restructuring costs in consultation with the Fund in the context of
reviews under the EA. Privatization receipts are defined to include all cash privatization
receipts (defined as cash received by the government including the privatization agency),
including those channeled to extrabudgetary funds, and from asset sales by the public sector
and by state-owned or socially-owned enterprises. Net external budgetary financing is

- 80 -

APPENDIX III
ANNEX D

defined to include all budgetary (i.e., non-project) grants and loans, less amortization (on a
cash basis). The estimation of the shortfalls (excesses) in the sum of net foreign budgetary
financing and privatization receipts will be based on the following projections (cumulative
from the beginning of the year specified) with the actual inflows evaluated at the average
exchange rates of the month when funds are received:

D. Nonbank Domestic Financing
13.
Definition. Nonbank domestic financing to the consolidated general government is
defined as any form of resident financing for the consolidated budget deficit other than
(i) from the NBS, (ii) from commercial banks, and (iii) privatization proceeds. This will
include domestic financing from nonbank financial institutions, nonfinancial enterprises,
households, and all other domestic financing not elsewhere classified. Nonbank domestic
financing covers any net change in the consolidated general government liabilities to any of
these institutions, representing either direct loans or advances to the consolidated general
government or holdings of securities of the consolidated general government, including
promissory notes or other contractual obligations. FFCD payments are treated below the line
as negative domestic nonbank financing.
14.
Adjustor. If quarterly net nonbank domestic financing deviates from the projected
quarterly cumulative path (coinciding with projected cumulative FFCD payments) provided
below in billions of dinars, the excess (shortfall) will trigger an equal downward (upward)
adjustment in (i) net banking system credit to the consolidated general government
(performance criterion) and in (ii) net banking system credit to the consolidated general
government in Serbia (indicative target).

E. Ceiling on Change in Domestic Arrears
15.
For program purposes, indicative targets will be set on the change in domestic arrears.
Separate indicative targets will be set for the consolidated general government of Serbia
(including union-level spending), and the consolidated general government of Montenegro.
16.

Definition

•

For the purpose of establishing compliance with this indicative target, union-level
expenditure is defined to comprise all budgetary activities specified in the
Constitutional Charter, including the SM army and the SM pension fund for retired
military personnel. The consolidated general government of Serbia is defined to
comprise all budgetary institutions financed from the Serbian state budget, the
Republican Pension and Invalidity Insurance Fund for Employees, the Republican
Pension and Invalidity Insurance Fund for Self-employed, the Republican Pension
and Invalidity Insurance Fund for Agricultural Workers, the Republican Health
Insurance Fund, the Republican Labor Market Agency, all republican special
directorates, and all other budgetary and extrabudgetary funds created by the
government of Serbia existing before or created during the period of the program. The
consolidated general government of Montenegro is defined to comprise all budgetary
institutions financed from the state budget, the Republican Pension and Invalidity
Insurance Fund, the Republican Health Insurance Fund, the Republican Labor Market
Fund, and all other budgetary and extrabudgetary funds created by the government of
Montenegro existing before or created during the period of the program.

•

The outstanding stock of domestic arrears comprises wage and pension arrears;
arrears with respect to accrued tax and social security contribution obligations,
including personal income tax and social security contributions of employees
withheld at source; arrears on social entitlement benefits (apart from pensions) to
households; arrears incurred with respect to the purchases of goods and services from
suppliers; arrears related to the servicing of domestic debt and nonpayment of
budgeted transfers to finance union-level expenditures.

•

The outstanding stock of wage arrears at a particular date are defined as total
accumulated unpaid wages of all employees on the regular payroll of all units
belonging to the parts of the general government as defined above, up to the latest
preceding regular pay date, which have not been settled by the test date. The total
stocks of wage arrears, thus defined, are on a gross basis and are calculated by
summing the wage arrears of all units of government with regard to their own
employees; transfers between different levels of government for making wage or
other payments are excluded from the estimates of these wage arrears.

•

Pension arrears are defined as total accumulated pensions due but not disbursed by
the pension funds concerned to all pensioners in the pension rolls up to the latest
preceding pension disbursement date.

- 82 -

APPENDIX III
ANNEX D

•

The outstanding stocks of tax and social contribution arrears at a particular date
comprise total accumulated accrued tax obligations of the parts of the general
government as defined above that have not been paid by the test date. The total stocks
of such arrears are on a gross basis.

•

Social entitlement payments, apart from pensions, are defined as all cash payments
due directly to, or on behalf of, the population in accordance with stipulations in the
law and which are not contingent upon the provision of any services or sale of any
goods or assets to the general government by such members of the population in
return for these payments. The stock of such entitlement arrears are defined as total
accumulated payments due but not disbursed by all units of government up to the test
date. Thus defined, these arrears are also on a gross basis and do not include the
netting out of any transfers made between different units of the general government
for the payment of such entitlements.

•

Arrears to suppliers comprise payments delayed beyond what was explicitly specified
in relevant contracts, or in the absence of such specification, for two months from the
date of submission of bills, for already-effected purchases of goods or services by the
government concerned. These include, inter alia, arrears to utility companies, arrears
incurred with respect to service and maintenance contracts, and payments for capital
goods. These arrears are also defined on a gross basis. Thus, overdue tax and other
obligations to the government of relevant enterprises are not included in the
calculation of the arrears of the government, and netting out of any transfers made
between different units of the general government for the payment of such arrears and
obligations are also not taken into consideration.

•

Arrears to domestic banks and nonbank lenders comprise all overdue payments
related to financial contracts between the government and domestic banks, nonbanks,
and private lenders.

•

Euro-denominated claims on government will be converted at the program exchange
rate; claims denominated in currencies other than the euro will first be converted at
their respective program exchange rates against the euro. The change in arrears is
defined as the change in the end-period stock of arrears. Changes in wage and
pension arrears will be adjusted for the changes in the average wage and average
pension in the economy relative to their respective values in December 2004.

17.
Reporting. Before the last business day of each month following the end of a quarter,
data on end-period stocks of arrears for the previous quarter will be supplied to the European
Department of the Fund by the Ministry of Finance of Serbia, and the Ministry of Finance of
Montenegro.

APPENDIX III
ANNEX D

F. Definition of Reserve Money
18.
Definition. Reserve money is defined as the sum of currency in circulation (NBY
Bulletin, September 2000, Table 3A, column 8) and dinar reserves banks are required to hold
at the NBS, plus excess reserves of the commercial banks. Shortfalls in reserves that banks
are required to hold will be included in required reserves (and therefore in reserve money), as
well as in bank borrowing from the NBS. As of December 31, 2004, the required reserve
ratio was at 21 percent of the base as defined in NBS Decision of March 28, 2002.
Subsequent changes in the reserve requirement will be reflected in program definitions. The
amounts that banks are permitted to hold in securities to satisfy the statutory reserve
requirement will be limited to the amount that banks were holding as of December 31, 2000
(SRD 174.1 million). Excess reserves include commercial banks’ (1) balances in Giro
accounts 620, 621, 623, and 625; (2) overnight deposit in account 205 at the NBS; (3) excess
balances above required reserves on account 201 at the NBS (with the shortfall in required
reserves counted as negative excess); and (4) cash in vaults.
19.
Data on reserve money will be monitored from the daily monetary indicators of the
NBS, which will be supplied to the European Department of the Fund weekly by the NBS
with a three-day lag. The end-month data is based on the NBS balance sheet, which will be
provided to the Fund with a lag of less than three weeks. On December 31, 2004, currency in
circulation amounted to SRD 45,165 million, while required reserves amounted to
SRD 20,808 million, and excess reserves to SRD 7,938 million. For program and projection
purposes, monthly averages of reserve money and its components were used. Data on
effective reserve requirements and the deposit base used in reserve requirement calculations
will be supplied to the European Department on a ten-day basis with a lag of less than a
week.
20.
Adjustors. For program monitoring purposes, reserve money will be adjusted as
follows. Should the standard reserve requirement increase (decrease) from the level
prevailing on December 31, 2004, the ceiling on net domestic assets would be increased
(decreased) by an amount equivalent to the change in the standard reserve requirement ratio
multiplied by the programmed deposit base used in the calculation of required reserves.
Before making any changes to the reserve requirement, the NBS will consult with Fund staff.
Required reserves of banks placed under BRA administration or liquidation will remain part
of reserve money for program purposes. Similarly, the CBM will consult with Fund staff
before making any changes to the reserve requirement.
G. Ceiling on External Debt-Service Arrears
21.
Definition. External debt-service arrears are defined as overdue debt service arising
in respect of obligations incurred directly or guaranteed by the public sector, except on debt
subject to rescheduling or restructuring. The program requires that no new external arrears be
accumulated at any time under the arrangement on public sector or public sector-guaranteed
debts.

- 84 -

APPENDIX III
ANNEX D

22.
Reporting. The accounting of nonreschedulable external arrears by creditor (if any),
with detailed explanations, will be transmitted on a monthly basis, within two weeks of the
end of each month. This accounting will include, separately, arrears owed at the union level,
by the Serbian and Montenegrin governments, and other public sector entities; arrears owed
by Yugoslav Airlines; and arrears owed to Paris Club creditors, London Club creditors, and
other creditors. Data on other arrears, which are reschedulable, will be provided separately.
H. Ceilings on External Debt
23.
Definitions. The ceiling on contracting or guaranteeing of new nonconcessional
external debt by the public sector with original maturity of more than one year applies not
only to debt as defined in point No. 9 of the Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect
to Foreign Debt adopted on August 24, 2000 (Decision No. 12274-(00/85), see Attachment I
to this Annex) but also to commitments contracted or guaranteed for which value has not
been received. Excluded from this performance criterion are loans from, or other
indebtedness to, the EBRD, the EIB and EU, the IBRD, the IMF, and the IFC. However, in
2005 cumulative from December 31, 2004, contracting or guaranteeing by the public sector
of new nonconcessional external debt from the EBRD, the EIB and EU, the IBRD, and the
IFC will not exceed US$100 million by end-March 2005, US$200 million by end-June 2005,
US$300 million by end-September 2005, and US$400 million by end-December 2005
(Annex A defines the separate ceilings applicable for Serbia and for Montenegro). For new
debt to budgetary users, the day the debt is contracted will be the relevant date for program
purposes. For new debt to non-budgetary users, the day the first guarantee (whether by the
Union, Serbia, or Montenegro) is signed will be the relevant date. Contracting or
guaranteeing of new debt will be converted into US dollar for program purposes at the cross
exchange rates implied by the official NBS exchange rates in effect on the day of the
transaction. Concessionality will be based on a currency-specific discount rate based on the
ten-year average of the OECD’s commercial interest reference rate (CIRR) for loans or
leases with maturities greater than 15 years and on the six-month average CIRR for loans and
leases maturing in less than 15 years. Under this definition of concessionality, only debt with
a grant element equivalent to 35 percent or more will be excluded from the debt limit.
Second, with regard to the ceiling on new external debt with original maturity of up to and
including one year owed by the consolidated general government or guaranteed by the public
sector, the term “debt” has the meaning set forth in point No. 9 of the Guidelines on
Performance Criteria with Respect to Foreign Debt adopted on August 24, 2000 (Decision
No. 12274-(00/85). Excluded from this performance criterion are normal short-term import
credits.
24.
Reporting. A debt-by-debt accounting of all new concessional and nonconcessional
debt contracted or guaranteed by the public sector, including the original debt documentation,
details on debt service obligations, as well as all relevant supporting materials, will be
transmitted on a quarterly basis, separately by Serbia and Montenegro, within four weeks of
the end of each quarter.

I. Ceiling on the Wage Bill of Serbian Public Enterprises
25.
Definition. For 2005, the performance criterion is set on a quarterly basis on the
cumulative monthly wage bill of eight large public enterprises, namely JP Elektroprivreda
Srbije, JP Naftna Industrija Srbije, JP Zeleznicko Transportno Preduzece Srbije, JP PTT
Srbije, JP Srbija Sume, JP JAT Airways, JP Telekom Srbija, and JP Aerodrom Beograd.
Wages are accounted on an accrual basis, excluding taxes and social security contributions,
and include overtime payments and bonuses.
26.
Adjustors. In the case of spin-offs of activities from these companies (defined as the
spinning off of a unit or its transfer to another entity or temporary/permanent transfers of
employees) after end-December 2004, the wage bill target will be adjusted downwards for
the wage bills of spun-off units. In the case of EPS, the successor companies (according to
MEFP paragraph 35, bullet two) will all be included in the wage ceiling.
27.
Reporting. The wage bills of the eight monitored state-owned companies will be
reported monthly to the European Department of the Fund and the Office of the IMF
Resident Representative by the Ministry of Finance (Public Utility Restructuring Unit) with a
lag of less than four weeks. Monthly data for JP Aerodrom Beograd will also be provided for
the period January through December 2004.

J. Adjustor for Lower-Than-Targeted Severance Payments
28.
Within the overall expenditure envelope of the 2005 budgets for the central
government in Serbia, the Union level government, and the Serbian Transition Fund a total
amount of SRD 8.2 billion is envisaged for severance payments, out of which
(a) SRD 5.0 billion related to employment reduction in the Serbian central government;
(b) SRD 2.0 billion related to employment reduction on the Union level; and
(c) SRD 1.2 billion included in the funds for the Transition Fund related to employment
reduction in the eight monitored state-owned enterprises listed in paragraph 24 of the TMU.
While the expenditures under (a) and (b) will be financed through general budgetary revenue,
expenditures under (c) will financed through privatization receipts. To ensure that these
budgetary resources can be spent only for the intended severance payments, the ceiling on
net credit of the banking system to the consolidated general government (performance
criterion) and on net credit of the banking system to the Serbian consolidated general
government (indicative target) will be adjusted downwards for the total shortfall of the
respective severance expenditures in categories (a), (b), and (c).

31.
Definition. The quantitative indicative targets are floors for the collection rates on
current deliveries and the collection of arrears for (i) Elektroprivreda Srbije (EPS); and
(ii) Naftna Industrija Srbije (NIS). Both collection rates are defined as the ratio of total cash
and off-sets collection during the respective period (cumulative from the beginning of the
year) from households, enterprises, and public sector entities (including collection of arrears)
over the total billed amounts during the same period.
32.
Reporting. EPS and NIS will report on a monthly basis to the European Department
of the Fund and the Office of the IMF Resident Representative with a lag of less than four
weeks. EPS and NIS will submit (i) total billed amounts, (ii) total cash collections, (iii) total

Executive Board Decision No. 6230-(79/140) (Guidelines on Performance Criteria
with Respect to Foreign Debt) adopted August 3, 1979, as amended by Executive
Board Decision No. 11096-(95/100) adopted October 25, 1995, and as amended on
August 24, 2000
Point No. 9
(a)
For the purpose of this guideline, the term “debt” will be understood to mean
a current, i.e., not contingent, liability, created under a contractual arrangement through the
provision of value in the form of assets (including currency) or services, and which requires
the obligor to make one or more payments in the form of assets (including currency) or
services, at some future point(s) in time; these payments will discharge the principal and/or
interest liabilities incurred under the contract. Debts can take a number of forms, the primary
ones being as follows:
(i)
loans, i.e., advances of money to the obligor by the lender made on the
basis of an undertaking that the obligor will repay the funds in the future (including
deposits, bonds, debentures, commercial loans and buyers’ credits) and temporary
exchanges of assets that are equivalent to fully collateralized loans under which the
obligor is required to repay the funds, and usually pay interest, by repurchasing the
collateral from the buyer in the future (such as repurchase agreements and official
swap arrangements);
(ii)
suppliers’ credits, i.e., contracts where the supplier permits the obligor
to defer payments until some time after the date on which the goods are delivered or
services are provided; and
(iii)
leases, i.e., arrangements under which property is provided which the
lessee has the right to use for one or more specified period(s) of time that are usually
shorter than the total expected service life of the property, while the lessor retains the
title to the property. For the purpose of the guideline, the debt is the present value (at
the inception of the lease) of all lease payments expected to be made during the
period of the agreement excluding those payments that cover the operation, repair or
maintenance of the property.
(b)
Under the definition of debt set out in point 9(a) above, arrears, penalties, and
judicially awarded damages arising from the failure to make payment under a contractual
obligation that constitutes debt are debt. However, arrears arising from the failure to make
payment at the time of delivery of assets or services are not debt.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2005 Article IV Consultation with
Serbia and Montenegro
On June 29, 2005, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Serbia and Montenegro.1
Background
Macroeconomic imbalances in Serbia and Montenegro have widened in 2004 putting at risk
some of the impressive earlier achievements. Growth, around 5 percent in non-agriculture
since 2002, has been fueled by a surge in domestic demand. Lack of competitive domestic
production has led to increased imports and a widening current account deficit. Annual inflation
returned to double-digit levels reflecting demand pressures and faster dinar depreciation
coupled with widespread euro-indexation. The current account deficit reached 15 percent of
GDP in 2004; the increase only partly explained by the value added tax (VAT) induced shift of
imports in late 2004. In Montenegro, the adoption of the euro has stabilized inflation at 3–4
percent. However, a large current account deficit, financed by foreign borrowing and, in 2005
by privatization receipts, risks eroding domestic competitiveness.
The attempts to use exchange rate policy to address rising inflation or deteriorating external
balances have failed due to important structural rigidities. Exchange rate depreciation led to
surging inflation given the high euro-indexation of prices, and small share of competitive

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of
the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to
the country's authorities.

-2supply, and fixing the exchange rate worsened the external balances, as a rigid spending
structure limited fiscal tightening and loose wage policy boosted demand.
The fiscal stance has increasingly been tightened to strengthen demand management.
The deficit declined from over 5 percent of GDP in 2002 to a projected surplus in 2005.
However, the bulk of the adjustment was due to an increase in revenues, while cuts in current
spending have been more limited. As a result, the revenue burden and the size of government,
with expenditures at 45 percent of GDP, remain the highest in the region. Monetary policy has
been accommodating, weakened by increasing euroization and complicated by a credit boom.
The slow structural reform is at the core of the macroeconomic imbalances and rigidities. With
the private sector at barely half of the GDP, the competitive supply remains limited. The weak
financial discipline in many of the public enterprises has reduced public savings and
undermined the tight fiscal policy pursued at the central government level. Given the external
financing constraint to investment, enterprise restructuring is increasingly important for growth
and for the efficient reallocating resources within the economy.
The main policy challenge is to maintain macroeconomic stability while accelerating structural
reform. Fiscal policy needs to be tightened substantially, and its flexibility increased by
reducing the large share of non-discretionary spending. A tighter monetary policy, despite the
high level of euroization, is necessary to slow down the credit boom and foreign borrowing
fuelling imports. Structural reforms should be deepened through the privatization and
liquidation of socially owned companies, restructuring of the state enterprises, and hardening
financial discipline. The successful bank privatization should continue, with the entry of new
banks boosting competition. Bank supervision is to be strengthened to deal with increased
foreign currency risk and credit activity.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities of Serbia and Montenegro for the tightening of
the fiscal stance over recent years, and the decrease in inflation from triple-digits that helped
create a basis for stronger GDP growth. However, Directors expressed concern over the
recent widening of the macroeconomic imbalances. Despite tight fiscal policy, domestic
demand has remained strong, putting pressure on inflation and the current account, as the
slow pace of structural reforms continued to suppress competitive domestic supply and
exports. The increased recourse to foreign debt to finance imports has heightened external
vulnerabilities.
Directors stressed that structural rigidities are at the core of the macroeconomic imbalances
and difficult policy dilemmas which the authorities are facing. Slow progress in addressing
these rigidities has hampered productivity growth, discouraged investments, including foreign
direct investment, and increased the cost of doing business. Weak financial discipline in many
state- and socially-owned enterprises, together with a rigid public expenditure structure and
high euroization, complicate macroeconomic management. Against the backdrop of the
current imbalances, Directors stressed that using the exchange rate to bear down on inflation
would need to be accompanied by a tightening of macroeconomic policies along with an

-3acceleration of structural reforms. They were encouraged by the authorities’ recent policy
adjustments and commitments in this regard.
Directors welcomed the envisaged reduction in the fiscal deficit. While immediate fiscal
consolidation relies on a combination of higher revenues and expenditure cuts, the challenge
now is to improve the quality of fiscal adjustment. Given the high tax burden, this will need to
be achieved through strong and sustained efforts to identify permanent expenditure savings
and reorient spending priorities towards supporting growth. Savings should focus on reducing
the high levels of nondiscretionary spending, in particular by cutting the wage bill and restoring
the financial viability of the pension fund. On the revenue side, Directors encouraged further
improvements in tax administration.
Directors emphasized that a further tightening of monetary policy will be needed to contain
demand, in particular to curb the strong growth in credit. They welcomed the increase in the
reserve requirement on foreign currency deposits of enterprises and commercial banks’
foreign borrowing, and the recent significant increase in the level of repo operations to mop up
dinar liquidity. Acknowledging that high and rising euroization has reduced the effectiveness of
monetary policy in Serbia, Directors underlined the need to complement monetary policy tools
with the continued use of prudential measures to slow credit growth and safeguard the quality
of the banks’ credit portfolio.
Directors highlighted the risks of using the exchange rate to anchor inflation, while, more
generally, the use of the exchange rate to pursue different objectives over time was seen as
weakening the credibility of economic policy. Directors noted that previous attempts to use
exchange rate depreciation to reduce the external imbalances had contributed to higher
inflation due to the widespread euro-indexation of prices in Serbia. While the authorities’
decision to use the exchange rate to bear down on inflation is understandable, this policy has
in the past also contributed to a worsening of the current account deficit. Accordingly, Directors
stressed that the preference for slower depreciation would necessitate tighter fiscal, monetary,
and income policies, while simultaneously accelerating structural reforms in the publicly
controlled enterprise sector.
Directors welcomed the increased pace of banking sector reforms, and the authorities’
commitment to follow through on the recommendations of the recent Financial Sector
Assessment Program (FSAP) review. Completing the sale of the remaining state-controlled
banks is a priority, and should spur competition in the sector and reduce the high spread
between borrowing and lending rates. Directors emphasized the need to further strengthen
banking regulation and supervision to bring them in line with international best practices.
Enhancing risk management and supervisory practices will be particularly important for
addressing the increasing risks and vulnerability emanating from rapid credit growth and the
growing share of euro-indexed loans to unhedged borrowers.
Directors urged the authorities to continue to push ahead with the privatization and liquidation
of socially-owned enterprises and with the restructuring of state-owned enterprises. In this
regard, they highlighted the importance of proper legal frameworks, and supported the
provision of appropriate safety nets. To strengthen financial discipline and allocate resources

-4for increased growth, Directors stressed the need to step up the use of bankruptcy procedures
against unviable socially-owned enterprises and to end the forbearance of arrears to the main
utility companies, while pressing ahead with their restructuring to recover operational costs.
The importance of further streamlining administrative regulations to improve the business and
investment climate was also highlighted. Going forward, Directors pointed to further integration
with the European Union as providing support and direction to future reform efforts.
Directors were encouraged by the recent macroeconomic developments in Montenegro, where
inflation has dropped to low single digits following the adoption of the euro. However, the
subdued rate of economic growth and high current account deficit remain a source of concern,
and Directors urged the Montenegrin authorities to continue to press forward with structural
reforms and the rationalization of public spending. The authorities should also resist pressures
to use the large proceeds from privatization expected for 2005 for fiscal spending.

IMF Executive Board Completes Fifth Review Under An Extended Arrangement With
Serbia and Montenegro and Approves US$182.9 Million Disbursement
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today completed the fifth review
of Serbia and Montenegro’s economic performance under an Extended Arrangement.
The completion of the review enables the release of an amount equivalent to SDR 125 million
(about US$182.9 million), which would bring the total disbursement under the program to
SDR 587.5 million (about $US859.7 million).
The Executive Board also granted waivers for the non-observance of the continuous performance
criterion on non-accumulation of new external arrears; the end-March performance criterion on
outstanding external arrears; the end-December 2004 structural performance criterion concerning
the Yugoslav army and union-level civil employees; and the end-February 2004 structural
performance criterion on the legal registration of the new electricity transmission and dispatch
company. In addition, the Board completed a Financing Assurances Review and approved a
request to rephase the eleventh and final disbursement, which would become available upon the
completion of the sixth review.
The Extended Arrangement was approved in May 2002 for a total amount equivalent to SDR
650 million (about US$951.1 million) to support Serbia and Montenegro’s 2002-2005 economic
program (see Press Release No. 02/25).
Following the Executive Board’s discussion on Serbia and Montenegro, Mr. Takatoshi Kato,
Deputy Managing Director and Acting Chair, stated:
“Following a mixed program implementation during the third year of their Extended
Arrangement with the Fund, the authorities of Serbia and Montenegro have agreed on an
appropriate set of corrective actions to deal with the growing macroeconomic imbalances.
While economic growth has been commendably strong, the continued strength of domestic
demand, sustained by a credit boom and inflows of remittances, as well as the constraints
stemming from the high euroization and structural rigidities have contributed to a resurgence in
inflation and a persistently large current account deficit. The authorities’ policies of further fiscal
and monetary tightening and accelerated structural reforms should help reverse the imbalances.
“The tighter fiscal stance is welcome. Following the heavy reliance in the short run on higher
revenues, it will now be important to implement the cuts in permanent spending, mostly through

-2-

pension reform and lower subsidies, that will help achieve a sustainable reduction in the size of
the public sector.
“The envisaged monetary tightening should help contain demand and inflationary pressures.
The strong pressure from recently established foreign banks competing for market shares to
increase credit calls for heightened vigilance, and the authorities should stand ready to take
further measures to tighten monetary conditions if needed. The privatization of the two largest
state-owned banks in Serbia will be a key priority for the period ahead.
“The use of the exchange rate to bear down on inflationary pressures is understandable given
those pressures and the extent of euroization. However, the approach is sustainable only in the
measure in which the tightening of macroeconomic policies offsets the impact of this policy on
the current account. More fundamentally, structural reforms, in particular, privatization and
restructuring of publicly controlled enterprises, need to be accelerated to stimulate export
growth, and enhance medium-term external sustainability. Strict enforcement of bankruptcy
procedures is also needed to reallocate resources within the economy.
“In Montenegro, the implementation of the agreed reduction in the fiscal deficit of about one
percent of GDP will help contain demand and the external deficit in line with the program.
The large privatization revenues should be used mainly to retire domestic debt. The development
of a debt and asset management strategy, strengthened revenue collection and acceleration of
civil service reform will be essential to create room for additional public investment.
“Strong implementation of the envisaged policy package will be key to lowering macroeconomic
imbalances, containing program risks, and boosting growth in the medium term. This will also be
key to ensuring the international community’s continued support for Serbia and Montenegro’s
adjustment and reform efforts,” Mr. Kato said.

Statement by Fritz Zurbrügg, Executive Director for Serbia and Montenegro
and Srboljub Antic, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
June 29, 2005
We thank staff for the comprehensive set of documents that present a well-balanced picture
of the economic situation in Serbia and Montenegro. The reports also spell out very clearly
the important challenges the authorities continue to face. Let us state from the outset that the
authorities share the staff’s views in terms of the main economic problems and the basic
orientation of the policy response. This is still a very delicate period in Serbia and
Montenegro’s transition to a full-fledged market economy. Our authorities are convinced that
the macroeconomic policies contained in the Memorandum of Economic and Financial
Policies (MEFP) are ambitious enough to tackle the increased vulnerabilities. The benchmark
for this review has been set at a high level, including a number of prior actions and
significantly strengthened structural conditionality.
It cannot be denied that there are considerable risks surrounding the current program. Our
authorities are fully aware of these risks and are committed to fully implement the economic
program supported by the Fund. It is important to note that the reform momentum from the
second part of 2004 has remained strong in 2005. This is reflected in a decreasing current
account deficit, a further strengthening of fiscal adjustment, and ongoing utility sector
restructuring.
This reform momentum has received a further boost from the political side, namely through
the completion of the EU’s feasibility study. This signals enhanced prospects for EU
accession, which establishes a clear framework for moving ahead with the reforms. The
recently signed trade arrangements with the EU are another positive element, which will
provide important support for the real economy. Furthermore, discussions on bilateral free
trade agreements in the region are progressing well, with many of them ratified and
implemented.
Recent developments
Real growth in 2004 surpassed expectations and is estimated at 7.2 percent. Agriculture and
the privatized part of the industry also recorded high growth rates. The growth rate for 2005
is projected at 4.5-5 percent, simply because it will be difficult to achieve a similar bumper
crop like in 2004. The weakening of the industrial production in the first quarter of 2005
remains a puzzle, since other indicators, such as exports and investment, are very positive.
The further acceleration of inflation in Serbia in 2005 is a source of concern for the
authorities. While the one-off effect of the VAT introduction in January 2005 played an
important role in pushing up inflation in 2004, curbing the main factor, namely high domestic
demand, will be the key policy answer to curb inflation in 2005. Together with controlled
increases in administrative prices, the slowing down of domestic demand should help in
reaching the targeted end-2005 inflation in Serbia of 10 percent. The authorities are aware of
the risks that this target could be exceeded and are ready to take the necessary corrective
actions to achieve it.

-2After reaching its peak of 15.5 percent of GDP in 2004, the current account deficit is
projected to decline to about 11 percent in 2005. Foreign trade statistics for the first four
months of 2005 show a significant improvement, with exports rising at a rate of 42.6 percent,
while imports declined by 11.4 percent. These foreign trade developments bode well for the
staff’s current account projections. In the medium term, the current account deficit is
projected to continue to decline, thus contributing to external sustainability.
Fiscal policy
Fiscal adjustment in Serbia and Montenegro has been strong over the last three years, with a
fiscal deficit of 3.3 percent in 2003 moving to a surplus of 1.2 percent of GDP in 2005. The
authorities continue to see sound fiscal policies as a key element of their stabilization efforts.
Fiscal policy will be the most important part of the policy mix that addresses inflationary
pressures and the higher-than-programmed current account deficit.
In Serbia, the fiscal stance in 2005 will be further tightened. Instead of having a small fiscal
deficit in 2005, as envisaged under the previous projections, the authorities will aim at a
surplus of 1.2 percent of GDP. Capital and current expenditures approved in the 2005 budget
will be scaled back by 0.7 percent of GDP and all revenues exceeding projections will be
saved. A draft supplementary budget that will incorporate lower expenditures will be
submitted to the parliament in July 2005. In the medium term, the government is committed
to cut permanent expenditures further. At least 1 percent of GDP expenditure cuts will be
incorporated in the 2006 budget.
The government is aware that decisive moves are needed to ensure long-term sustainability
of the pension system. An inter-ministerial task force was formed to work on pension
legislation with the objective to reduce the structural deficit of the pension fund over time.
The task force will cover all important issues, including de-linking pensions from wages,
accelerating the increase in the retirement age, and indexation frequency.
In Montenegro, further deficit reduction should strengthen the macroeconomic stability. On
the expenditure side, the efforts on the civil service reform will be stepped up to reach the
agreed government employment reduction. If expectations of higher than projected
privatization revenues materialize, the government will reduce debt and build up reserves.
Monetary policy
The National Bank of Serbia (NBS) has been tightening monetary policy in order to contain
domestic demand and inflationary pressures. The revised monetary program for 2005
projects further rising of foreign exchange reserves, which will grow to US$5.6 billion and
will cover 4.3 months of imports at the end of 2005. As described in detail in the MEFP, the
NBS will significantly increase the volume of repo operations to better manage market
liquidity.
In order to slow down further credit growth and borrowing from abroad by banks and the
private sector, the NBS increased reserve requirements from 21 to 26 percent on foreign

-3currency deposits. To curb rising euroization, reserve requirements on dinar deposits were
slightly lowered.
The role of the exchange rate policy has been constrained by the high and recently growing
euroization, which has strengthened the pass-through effect. As in the past, the authorities
will continue to use the exchange rate policy to balance the objectives of reducing inflation
and curbing the current account deficit. Against the background of a recent inflation surge,
the exchange rate policy will be used to increase confidence in the dinar. The authorities will
frequently assess the exchange rate policy in light of developments in inflation, current
account, and wages.
Structural policies
The acceleration of structural reforms is a key element in the authorities’ efforts to reduce the
macroeconomic imbalances. After gaining momentum in the second half of 2004,
privatization and restructuring of the so-called socially owned enterprises continues in 2005.
The authorities’ intention is to offer all socially owned companies for sale until the end of
2006 through auctions, tenders or share sale on the stock exchange. A debt workout scheme,
that will make write-offs of debt conditional upon privatization, is being introduced to help
privatize large enterprises. The authorities are also moving ahead with an effective
bankruptcy procedure that will strengthen financial discipline. The bankruptcy process will
become fully operational in the beginning of the third quarter 2005. In April, the government
initiated the bankruptcy procedure under the new regulation against three large and heavily
indebted loss makers to give credibility to the new bankruptcy legislation. Other creditors
followed this approach and have initiated many bankruptcy proceedings.
As outlined in paragraphs 42-43 of the MEFP, the restructuring of public utilities will
continue through combined measures that introduce competition and improve efficiency by
imposing hard budget constraints through subsidy cuts and strict wage controls. An
independent energy regulator started to operate at the end of May 2005. The unbundling
process of the electric power company will be started with the creation of two companies
(generation and distribution company, and grid company) and is covered under the program
with a structural performance criterion. As regards the unbundling of the oil and gas
company, the authorities expect the enabling legislation to be passed by parliament in July
2005 (also a structural performance criterion). Furthermore, an international tender will be
launched for hiring an advisor for the privatization of the oil and gas company.
Conclusion
The authorities of Serbia and Montenegro are fully aware of the difficult challenges they
currently face. Responding to the slower-than-expected reaction of macroeconomic
indicators to the measures taken in the second half of 2004, they have further tightened
economic policies and strengthened the structural reform program. They are committed to
this program and are grateful for the Fund’s support. The authorities also remain fully
committed to transparency in the relations with the Fund and consent to the publication of all
staff documents.
