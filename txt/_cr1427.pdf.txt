STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
January 15, 2014

KEY ISSUES
Economic Outlook: Strong private consumption and residential investment helped Canada
recover quickly from the last recession but left a legacy of elevated household debt and high
house valuations. The transition to more balanced economic growth, with stronger
contribution from exports and business investment, has proved elusive, and economic activity
remained modest in 2013. Staff expects growth to accelerate above potential in 2014,
following a stronger recovery in the United States, but the balance of risks remains on the
downside.
Policy Mix: Low inflation, downside risks around the pickup in activity over the near future,
and the moderation in the housing sector since mid-2012 suggest the Bank of Canada has
more time to wait before starting to normalize interest rates than we anticipated in the 2012
Article IV Consultation Staff Report. With strong post-crisis fiscal consolidation and low levels
of net debt, the federal government has room to delay the planned return to a balanced
budget in 2015 absent a meaningful pickup in growth. There is limited room for maneuver for
those provinces that have made less progress in reducing the fiscal deficits and face longterm fiscal sustainability challenges.
Housing sector, macro-prudential policies, and mortgage insurance: Household leverage
remains high, and while house price and construction growth have come off their post-crisis
peaks, high valuations and excess supply in a number of housing markets are a source of
vulnerability. If maintained, the ongoing moderation in the housing market suggests little
need for additional macro-prudential measures but it is important to remain vigilant. Over
the longer term, rethinking the role of government-backed mortgage insurance may reduce
the government exposure to housing sector risks and lead to a more efficient allocation of
resources.
Financial sector policies: While Canada’s financial supervisory and regulatory framework is
strong, there is room to strengthen it further along the lines indicated by the 2013 FSAP
Update mission.
Policy response to past advice: Since the 2012 Article IV Consultation mission, authorities
have continued to take measures to ensure a sustainable development of the housing
market, which the mission emphasized as a source of vulnerability last year. Recent progress
in moving towards a less fragmented regulation of securities markets is also in line with past
staff advice. At the provincial level, efforts to contain health care spending, the establishment
of an independent fiscal council in Ontario, and the introduction of a new fiscal framework in
Alberta are all consistent with recommendations contained in previous staff reports.

After rebounding strongly from the depth of the financial crisis, business investment growth has
weakened since mid-2012 (Figure 1). The slowdown has been particularly concentrated in
non-residential structures (mainly energy-related) and machinery and equipment, which
provided no contribution to growth in the first three quarters of 2013. Growth in residential
investment picked up somewhat in 2013 but after slowing sharply from high levels, partly in
response to the last round of measures (including stricter mortgage insurance rules and
tighter mortgage underwriting standards) introduced to stabilize the housing market in 2012.

Despite the rebound, export growth remained subdued in 2013. Canada’s exports have barely
recovered from the Great Recession and are well below the levels reached after earlier
recessions (Chart). The weakness can

eroded Canada’s external

manufacturing sector (IMF Country Report No. 13/41). By contrast, energy exports volumes
surged in recent years, thanks to strong growth in crude oil exports, which in late 2013 were
30 percent above the 2008 levels, while growth in natural gas exports has slowed significantly
following the sharp increase in U.S. production since mid-2000s.

2013, but are on a declining trend: as of November 2013, their 6-month moving average was
about 10 percent below last year’s peak, mainly owing to weaker construction of multiple units,
especially in Ontario.1 Despite the downward trend in growth, a few simple indicators continue to
suggest overvaluation in the Canadian housing market. In particular, house prices are high
relative to both income and rents, compared to historical averages (Chart) and many other

than in the past. The general
government overall deficit is expected to improve to 3.1 percent of GDP in 2013 (from
3.4 percent of GDP in 2012), with different dynamics for the federal and provincial governments
(Figure 4). In particular:


The federal government’s deficit for the fiscal year 2012–13 (ending in March) was 1 percent
of GDP, ½ percent of GDP smaller than anticipated in the March 2013 Budget, mainly on
account of a larger-than-expected spending restraint by departments. In the 2013 Fall
Economic and Fiscal Update, the federal government confirmed the intention to return to a
balanced budget in the fiscal year 2015–16, largely on the back of continued program
spending restraint. Staff estimates the annual deficit for 2013 to be around ¾ percent of
GDP, down from 1 percent in 2012, implying a modest 0.1 percentage point of GDP drag on
growth in 2013 compared to about ½ percentage point in 2012.

In contrast, the fiscal stance has

while others relied on further
spending cuts and one-off measures to offset lower revenues. Ontario’s fiscal deficit was
about ¾ percentage points of GDP better than estimated in the budget, thanks to one-time
savings, revenue windfalls, and the drawing down of the contingency reserve. Staff estimates

This estimate is obtained from a series of models that regress real house prices on a set of variables that affect

formation, labor force participation, and real mortgage rates). See also IMF Country Report, 41/2013).

that the overall deficit for provinces, municipalities, and territorial authorities remained
broadly unchanged in 2013, at about 3 percent of GDP.
4.
As the output gap increased and inflation fell, the Bank of Canada kept its policy
rate at 1 percent and adopted a more dovish stance. Five quarters of below-potential growth
since 2011 have increased the estimated size of the output gap, which staff calculates at about
1.3 percent as of 2013:Q3. The higher size of economic slack, heightened competition in the
retail sector, lower food prices, and lower imported inflation have all contributed to downward
pressure on price levels. As of November 2013, annual headline CPI inflation was 1 percent (y/y),
at the lower end of the 1–3 percent Bank of Canada’s target band, while core inflation slowed to

2013 the Canadian dollar fell to the
lowest level in over three years against the U.S. dollar.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
5.
Annual growth is expected to accelerate to 2¼ percent in 2014, up from an
estimated 1¾ percent in 2013. With output growing at just above the potential rate of about
2 percent, the remaining spare capacity would gradually be absorbed with the unemployment
rate projected to converge to its natural rate of close to 6½ percent over the medium term. As
the economic slack is reabsorbed, headline CPI inflation would pick up in 2014, approaching the
Bank of Canada’s target rate of 2 percent (y/y) by end-2015.
6.
Monetary policy is expected to remain accommodative, while fiscal policy will
continue to be a modest headwind to growth. In staff’s baseline, the policy interest rate is
projected to increase starting in early 2015, gradually reaching 4 percent by the end of the
forecast horizon, while long-term interest rates are forecast to increase gradually, in line with
those in the United States. Continued fiscal consolidation, at both federal and provincial levels,
would subtract about ¼ percentage points of GDP growth per year over the next three years.
7.
The baseline scenario envisages a rotation in demand towards investment and
exports (Chart). In particular:

Non-residential business investment is also expected to accelerate, as the more favorable and

Private consumption growth is also expected to be somewhat slower, as the elevated level of
debt in the context of higher interest rates and slower house price growth is expected to
induce households to become increasingly cautious with their spending. Still, private
consumption is expected to continue to be supported by improvements in labor market
conditions and to remain the main contributor to GDP growth going forward, adding about
1.1 percent to growth on average over the medium term, compared to close to 2 percent on
average over the decade before the Great Recession.

In contrast, residential investment is projected to continue to decline over the next 5 years, to
levels more consistent with medium-term fundamentals. Staff estimates from a construction
activity model suggest a gradual slowdown of the residential investment-to-GDP ratio from

the forecasting horizon (Chart).4

8.
Risks to this outlook are mainly on the downside and stem primarily from external
sources (Chart, and Table 1). An overshooting of long-term interest as the Fed’s exit from
quantitative easing (QE) could
Canada: Risk Flow Illustration
negatively affect the U.S. recovery and
hence Canada’s exports. Protracted
weakness in the euro area economic
recovery could hurt Canada mainly
through confidence and financial
channels, as well as through indirect
trade links, while lower-thananticipated growth in emerging markets
would affect Canada mainly through a
decline in commodity prices, although
a weakening of the Canadian dollar
could soften the impact. At the same
time, a faster recovery in the U.S. pose
upside risks to our baseline forecasts,
together with a stronger than currently
envisaged performance of Canada’s housing sector, although the latter would also increase risks
to domestic financial stability down the road.
9.
In addition to being a risk per se, elevated household leverage and house prices
could amplify the growth impact of adverse external shocks. A sharper correction of house
prices than in our baseline scenario could reduce household net worth, tighten lending
conditions, and hurt confidence, with negative repercussions on domestic demand, output and
employment. In a scenario where the U.S. economic recovery accelerates and initial steps taken
by the Fed to normalize monetary policy conditions result in an abrupt increase in the term
premium, financial conditions would likely tighten in Canada, too. The simulations contained in
the IMF 2013 Spillover Report show that the net impact on Canada from such scenarios is likely to
be positive, as the boost to exports (helped also by a lower Canadian dollar) would more than
offset the negative impact of tighter financial conditions on domestic demand. However, staff
simulations contained in Annex I indicate that if the sharper increase in long-term interest rates
were to trigger a greater and more rapid fall of house prices and household deleveraging than
currently factored in the baseline scenario, the net gains from the stronger U.S. recovery could
dissipate.
10.
The energy sector is a source of both downside and upside risks to the outlook. A
more rapid growth in U.S. production of unconventional energy and/or delays in the expansion
of transportation capacity would limit the demand for Canadian energy, put downward pressure
on Canadian energy prices, and adversely affect exports and investment. At the same time,
however, there are upside risks, especially in the natural gas sector: faster progress in solving the
infrastructure bottlenecks could widen access of Canadian energy resources to international

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CANADA

(including non-U.S.) and domestic (including Canada’s eastern provinces) markets, boost
production, and raise the price of Canadian energy (Box 1).
11.
The authorities have room to respond to these negative shocks and buffer the
economy against some of their consequences. If the removal of unconventional monetary
support in the United States were to cause a more rapid-than-anticipated increase of interest
rates, the Bank of Canada would have room to at least partly offset the tightening of financial
conditions by cutting the policy rate. If a more abrupt adjustment of housing imbalances were to
cause substantial credit losses and severe shortages of liquidity for Canadian financial
institutions, the authorities could effectively intervene by providing guarantees on bank loans or
directly injecting liquidity, as occurred during the 2008–09 recession. If negative shocks were to
reduce growth further below potential, the federal government would have room for a
countercyclical policy reaction, thanks to the relatively low level of net debt and strong fiscal
consolidation over the past few years.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
The policy discussions focused on the appropriate policy mix to sustain the acceleration of
economic activity and protect it against the downside risks, as well as longer-term issues, including
how to achieve long-term fiscal sustainability for the general government, scale back government
involvement in mortgage insurance, and further strengthen the financial sector.

A. Outlook and Policies to Boost Growth Potential
12.
The authorities concurred with staff that a pickup in export and business
investment is needed to generate a more balanced and sustainable growth. The authorities
agreed that weakening global demand has resulted in a slowdown in business investment
recently after a strong performance earlier in the recovery, but they expect that the necessary
and anticipated rotation toward exports and a return to stronger business investment growth
should take place when U.S. economic growth accelerates. They also argued that while the
recession has caused a sharp reduction of the number of firms, especially in the export sector,
those that survived the crisis are competitive and ready to expand capacity once they see more
concrete signs of stronger demand. The authorities agreed that the balance of risks was tilted to
the downside, and that a slower-than-expected recovery in the United States as well as a more
protracted period of slower growth or financial turbulence in the euro area would have spillovers
to Canada. However, they expressed confidence that private consumption would continue to
sustain growth, given that the consumption-to-GDP ratio is not out of line with historical
average, and that a better balance between domestic and foreign demand would be achieved
over time.

1/ January–September, 2013.
Growing U.S. energy production and
infrastructure constraints have adversely affected Canada’s energy exports in recent years. Canada is
almost entirely dependent on the U.S. for its energy exports. While U.S. oil imports have declined over the
last decade, Canada’s oil exports to the United States have continued to rise, with Canada’s share of U.S. oil
imports doubling to 33 percent in 2013, at the expense of other oil exporters. But growing oil production in
the U.S. since 2008 has put pressure on pipeline transportation and refinery capacity, lowering the price of
Canadian oil (particularly, Western Canadian Select, WCS) relative to the U.S. benchmark (West Texas
Intermediate, WTI)—the gap between WCS and WTI prices reached an historical high of US$35 per barrel in
2012. After falling to US$15 per barrel in mid-2013 as the increased reliance on rail managed to relieve
transportation bottlenecks, the gap widened again to US$35 per barrel by November 2013. Estimates
suggest that Canada is losing at least ½ percent of GDP because of market access limitations. In contrast to
crude oil, Canada’s natural gas exports to the U.S. have been on a declining path since mid-2000s, as the U.S.
production of natural gas has significantly increased in this period. Going forward, U.S. production of natural
gas is expected to increase further, with the U.S. becoming a net gas exporter after 2020 (U.S. EIA, 2013
Annual Energy Outlook).

In our medium-term baseline scenario, we expect Canada’s crude oil exports to the U.S. to grow at a
somewhat slower pace than in recent years. Crude oil export volumes are projected to increase at about
5½ percent (quarterly average) over 2014–19, compared to the average 8 percent over 2009–13. The
increase is projected to come mainly from unconventional oil production (already comprising 60 percent of
Canada’s total crude oil production). The assumptions behind our forecasts are:



The WSC discount of about US$23 per barrel in 2013:Q3 is taken as a basis, and is expected to evolve in
line with the projected crude oil price growth in the January 2014 WEO Update. The latter forecasts oil
prices to decline by about 20 percent between end-2013 and 2019.



More use of rail transportation, reversing existing pipeline flows, and completing conversion works at
major U.S. refineries to process heavy Canadian crude oil is expected to be sufficient to accommodate
the projected increase of Canada’s oil exports to the U.S. in the next couple of years. After that, we
assume that additional capacity will be in place to bring Canada’s heavy oil to regions with the greatest
refinery capacity, such as the U.S. Midwest and, especially, the Gulf Coast (Chart). There are currently a
number of major projects under consideration, with total takeaway capacity of almost the same size as
Canada’s current oil production (about 3 million barrels per day), and the implementation of any of
these major projects would provide a significant increase in transportation capacity (see Selected Issues
paper).

Exporting natural gas to nonU.S. markets would revive the sector’s prospects and reverse the downward trend, but it would require
building large-scale facilities close to the Canadian coast that could liquefy natural gas and ship it overseas.

13.
The authorities and staff agreed that raising productivity growth and broadening
market access to Canada’s energy resources would be essential to boost growth potential.


The authorities noted that the widening productivity gap with the U.S. can be attributed to a
number of factors, including insufficient capital deepening, underinvestment in innovation
technologies and R&D, and remaining barriers to inter-provincial competition. While a
number of policy initiatives have been taken in recent years to boost productivity (such as
cuts in corporate taxes and a more flexible immigration system), the authorities said that
more remains to be done consistent with the government’s Economic Action Plan. For
example, funding was announced in Economic Action Plan 2013 for a new pilot program for
small- and medium-size enterprises (SMEs). This program will be rolled out in 2014, and will
provide SMEs with voucher-like credit notes to pay for research, technology and business
development services from universities, colleges and other not-for-profit institutions of their
choice.



On the prospects for the energy sector, staff noted it would be essential to relieve existing
transportation bottlenecks, maintain an open regime for inward foreign direct investment
(FDI), and address potential skills shortages in resource-rich provinces. The authorities said
they expect the transportation capacity constraints to be resolved over time, and agreed on

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

the need to diversify exports to non-U.S. markets. Entering into new free trade agreements
would help Canada diversify its export market base more broadly. In this context, staff
welcomed Canada’s recent progress on a framework agreement with the European Union on
establishing a comprehensive free trade zone.
14.
These policies would also increase Canada’s external competiveness and help close
external imbalances. Canada’s current account deficit has hovered around 3¼ percent of GDP
in 2013 and is projected to improve to 2½ percent over the next few years, mainly as stronger
external demand fuels export growth. In staff’s views, however, Canada’s current account would
still be somewhat weaker than the level consistent with medium-term fundamentals (see
Annex II). A reduction of the productivity gap with major trading partners, a smaller gap between
the price of Canadian heavy oil and international benchmark prices for crude oil, and a lower
exchange rate as safe-haven capital inflows abate (in the context of stronger U.S. growth and a
lower Canada-U.S. interest rate differential), would all contribute to strengthening the current
account balance and move it closer to the estimated norm. Despite falling by over 3 percent in
the first three quarters of 2013, the real effective exchange rate remains about 10 percent above
its long-term average, and in staff’s view is overvalued, with the gap relative to estimates of
“equilibrium” real exchange rates in the 5–15 percent range. The authorities argued that they see
the value of the Canadian dollar as market determined, and that its flexibility acts as an
important buffer against external shocks.

B. Monetary Policy: Substantial Policy Stimulus Remains Appropriate
15.
There was broad agreement that the policy interest rate could stay low for a longer
period of time. Staff saw room to maintain the current highly accommodative monetary policy
stance for a longer period than anticipated a year ago, given the greater output gap, looming
downside risks, and the moderation of the housing market. The authorities agreed, and also
flagged growing concerns about the deceleration of inflation below the lower end of the Bank of
Canada’s target band, which may reflect not only the size of economic slack but also more
persistent factors than previously anticipated, most notably the effects of heightened
competition in the retail sector. Staff noted that despite recent signs of moderation, still-elevated

Canadian and U.S. long-term interest rates. Staff and the authorities agreed that monetary policy
would continue to be effective through its impact on interest rates—particularly at short to
medium maturities (Chart)—and the exchange rate. The authorities noted that a smooth exit
from QE accompanying strengthening private demand in the United States would benefit the
rebalancing of Canadian economy away from housing and toward exports.

C. Fiscal Policy: Pursuing Growth-Friendly Fiscal Consolidation
16.
The discussion on fiscal policy focused on the appropriate pace of fiscal
consolidation. The authorities noted that they were somewhat surprised at the better-thanexpected federal budget deficit for 2012–13, to the extent that it reflected departments spending
less than the budget they had been appropriated at the beginning of the year. They attributed
this result to efficiency gains achieved at the departmental level, which would suggest a relatively
small drag on growth from fiscal restraint. Staff noted that, given the low level of debt and good
progress in fiscal consolidation since the peak of the crisis, there is room to relax the fiscal stance if
economic growth fails to pick up above potential over the next few quarters.5 The authorities
responded that the adjustment needed to return to a balanced budget was relatively small and
largely underway, and that excessively fine-tuning fiscal policy at this stage would be counterproductive. They saw more merit in sticking to the announced fiscal targets, and thus return to a
balanced budget by 2015, as this would also have a positive impact on business and consumer
confidence. With regard to fiscal policy stances at the provincial level, staff argued that provinces
facing headwinds in their fiscal consolidation plans might need to consider additional measures
to ensure their deficit reduction timetable is met. Ontario’s authorities noted that additional
measures were considered to ensure the deficit returns to balance in fiscal year 2017–18.
17.
Staff called for continued efforts to ensure long-term fiscal sustainability at the
general government level. Extrapolating recent fiscal trends into the next four decades yields a
relatively steep increase of the net debt-to-GDP ratio at the general government level—from
around 35 percent in 2012 to 60 percent in 2050 (Annex III). To a large degree, this acceleration
reflects the increase in health care spending at the provincial level mainly caused by the
projected aging of the Canadian population. To be sure, growth in health care spending has
slowed in many Canadian provinces after the last recession, but it is not entirely clear whether
this trend can be maintained in the future (Box 2). The authorities noted that the recent
significant reduction observed in the growth of health-care spending suggested health care
providers were re-organizing the way health care was funded and delivered, and thus were
confident that at least some of the recent moderation could be sustained going forward. Staff
noted that population aging would lead to a sharp increase in health care spending even if the
recent gains were to be maintained, and that more efforts would therefore be needed to
maintain the general government net debt-to-GDP ratio on a sustainable long-term path. To
raise the public awareness of the challenges ahead and build the necessary consensus behind

actually slowed even more.1 This suggests that common factors may be at play across these economies, and
in particular that the lower spending on health care could be a temporary byproduct of the Great Recession.
But over the last few years many countries, including Canada, have also started reforms to change the way
health care is funded and provided, which suggests the post-crisis slowdown in spending could be a more
durable phenomenon.
The decline in Canada’s health care spending since 2009 has been broad-based. Average spending



A few provinces—notably Alberta, British Columbia, and Ontario—have started to move away from
global budgeting (which attributed yearly budgets to hospitals based on historical levels) toward more
patient or activity based funding models for hospitals.



Many provinces are increasing out-of-hospital care as part of the move to more decentralized delivery
systems. In particular, there has been heavier use of non-institutional care for seniors with chronic
conditions. Québec moved to a greater reliance on out-of-hospital care system as early as in 2003, with
the reform that put in place the Centres de Santé et de Services Sociaux. Efforts have also been devoted
to increasing the coordination between primary care and hospital care providers, for example, in Ontario
through the creation of 19 Health Links. Moreover, nurse practitioners and pharmacists are being
allowed to provide services currently performed by more expensive physicians.

Box 2. Recent Trends in Canada’s Health Care Spending (Concluded)


Many provinces have agreed in 2010 to consolidate purchases of common drugs, medical supplies, and
equipment. In 2012, generic drugs were also added to the agreement. In 2011, British Columbia
changed the eligibility rule for its provincial drug benefit program from age-based to income-based.

Econometric analysis suggests that cyclical factors and budgetary restraints can only partly explain
the slowdown in health spending, suggesting that structural changes may also be at play. We
estimated a panel data model of health care spending through a regression specification including a series

those efforts it is important to publish long-term fiscal sustainability analysis at both provincial
and general government levels. The announced establishment in Ontario of a Financial
Accountability Office (FAO) is a promising step in that direction.6
18.
The mission also discussed the merit for changes in the fiscal framework at both
federal and provincial levels once the return to a balanced budget is completed. The federal
authorities have recently announced the intention to introduce a rule requiring balancing the
federal budget “during normal economic times,” with a clear timetable for returning to a
balanced position if falling into deficit. Staff welcomed the plan, as introducing a formal rule
could strengthen the fiscal framework after the deficit is eliminated and when the desire for fiscal
discipline is likely to wane. While the authorities said that the details of the rule still need to be

worked out, staff emphasized that the rule would need to be simple, transparent, and supportive
of macroeconomic stability by avoiding pro-cyclical fiscal stances. Following up on last year’s
recommendation, staff also re-stated the importance of adopting fiscal frameworks that going
forward would allow saving the revenue windfall gains from high commodity prices and minimize
the fiscal and macroeconomic volatility associated with commodity price fluctuations. The
introduction of a new fiscal framework in Alberta in 2013 appears to go in this direction.7 The
authorities noted that the recommendation would be appropriate for energy-abundant
provincial jurisdictions, but staff noted there could be room for similar changes at the federal
level, given the projected growing importance of the resource sector in the Canadian economy,
and, therefore the federal budget.

D. Policies for the Housing Sector: What Role for Government-Backed
Mortgage Insurance?
19.
While the moderation of housing activity since its post-crisis peak suggests no need
for additional macro-prudential measures at the current juncture, it is important to remain
vigilant. The macro-prudential measures introduced over the past few years have been effective
in moderating the pace of household debt accumulation and cooling off the housing market.
Staff and the authorities concurred that the pickup in home sales and housing starts since the
summer of 2013 is likely to be a transitory phenomenon, the result of demand brought forward
at the expense of future months as more borrowers have finalized their mortgages on fears that
rates would continue to increase further. Nonetheless, there was broad consensus that should
house price and mortgage credit growth re-accelerate on a more widespread and sustained
basis, additional measures may be needed. In staff’s view, possible options could include higher
down-payment requirements for first-time buyers and lower caps on debt-service-to-income
ratios.
20.
The mission discussed the merit of rethinking the role of government-backed
mortgage insurance over the long term. The current system of pervasive government-backed
mortgage insurance (Box 3) has its advantages, particularly as it gives the government a macroprudential tool that can be used to stabilize the housing sector and the financial system more
broadly, as shown during the recent crisis; and because it provides cheap funding to small
mortgage lenders, potentially boosting competition in the mortgage market.

7

In March 2013, Alberta introduced a new fiscal framework, based on three different plans: (i) a “saving plan”,
whereby a share of the revenues from non-renewable resource will be saved every year into a Contingency
Account up to a maximum amount, with any excess revenue diverted into the Alberta Heritage Savings Trust
Fund or other provincial endowments; (ii) an “operating plan”, consisting of operating revenues and expenses,
that can only run a deficit if there is money into the Contingency Account; and (iii) a “capital plan”, largely funded
though borrowing and with limits to annual debt-servicing costs, linked to the size of operational revenues, that
will finance infrastructure projects.

Box 3. Mortgage Insurance in Canada
Federally-regulated lenders in Canada are required to purchase insurance for mortgage loans with LTV
ratios above 80 percent. Mortgages with LTV ratios of 80 percent or below (“low LTV loans”) may also be insured.
Mortgage lenders that insure low LTV loans typically do so for securitization purposes, as these loans are
packaged and sold as mortgage backed securities (MBS), to access low-cost funding for new loans.
Mortgage insurance is provided by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) and two
private companies. CMHC, which has a market share of about 75 percent, is a federal government-owned
corporation. The two private mortgage insurers, Genworth and Canada Guaranty, have a combined market share
of about 25 percent. Private mortgage insurers and CMHC’s commercial activities are supervised by the Office of
the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI), but OSFI does not have corrective powers over the CMHC.
The federal government guarantees 100 percent of CMHC’s insured loans and 90 percent of the original
value of those insured by private companies. To address risks associated with the provision of these guarantees,
the federal government sets underwriting standards for insured mortgages and for participating mortgage
insurers (“sandbox rules”). Insured mortgage loans have lower risk weights in banks’ balance sheets than uninsured
loans, with CMHC-insured mortgages having a capital risk weight of zero. Overall, government-backed mortgage
insurance covers around two-thirds of all mortgage loans in Canada (about 40 percent of GDP). The total value of
CMHC’s mortgage insurance is currently limited by legislation to a maximum of Can$600 billion (about one-third
of GDP), a limit which has been raised four times since 2004 (from below 20 percent of GDP). The limit for private
insurers is Can$300 billion.
The federal government also provides guarantees to Mortgage Backed Securities (MBS) backed by insured
mortgages. CMHC provides a guarantee of principal and interest payments on the National Housing Act (NHA)
MBS, introduced in 1986. Hence, investors in NHA MBS benefit from a two-layer government-backed guarantee,
first against the risk that the borrower may default on the underlying mortgages, and second against default by
the issuer of the securities. NHA MBS investors however, remain subject to prepayment risk, since their cash flows
are reduced if borrowers make full or partial prepayments on their mortgages. Starting from 2001, financial
institutions may sell NHA MBS to the Canada Housing Trust, a special-purpose trust created by CMHC, which
funds itself by issuing Canadian Mortgage Bonds (CMB). The CMB program enhances the NHA MBS program
because CMBs are structured to eliminate prepayment risk for the investors.
CMHC’s securitization programs account for about one-third of total outstanding residential mortgages in
Canada, up from about 10 percent in early 2000s. An important reason for the growth of the CMHC’s
securitization programs, especially CMBs, is that they provide a low-cost term funding vehicle to mortgage
lenders, especially small non-bank lenders. Issuance grew strongly during the global financial crisis, as the federal
government purchased NHA MBS from financial institutions through the Insured Mortgage Purchase Program,
which ended in 2010, to provide and additional source of liquidity.
A number of measures have been introduced since 2011 to limit government’s exposure to mortgage
insurance and strengthen the oversight of CMHC. These measures include (i) withdrawing government-backed
insurance on lines of credit secured by houses (HELOCs) and refinanced mortgages; (ii) formalizing the rules for
the government-backed mortgage insurance and other existing arrangements with private mortgage insurers, and
increasing insurance-in-force limit for private mortgage insurers; (iii) prohibiting banks from issuing covered bonds
backed by government-insured mortgages; (iv) setting quantitative limits on new issuance of NHA MBS and CMBs;
(v) requiring CMHC to pay the federal government a risk fee on new insurance premiums written and a charge of
10 basis points on new portfolio insurance starting January 2014; and (vi) announcing plans to prohibit the use of
government-backed insured mortgages in non-CMHC securitization programs and gradually limit the insurance of
low LTV mortgages to those that will be used in CMHC securitization program. Moreover, CMHC oversight has
been strengthened in 2012, including by mandating OSFI to conduct examinations of CMHC’s insurance and
securitization businesses.

But it also presents risks, as stressed in
the companion 2013 Financial System
Stability Assessment (FSSA).8 First,
underpriced mortgage insurance may
encourage excessive risky loans and
expose the taxpayers to housing sector
risks. Second, it may result in an inefficient
allocation of resources, with banks
leaning toward risk-free mortgages at the
expense of loans towards more
productive uses of capital, especially loans
to small-and-medium-size enterprises.
Mortgages and consumer loans secured
by real estate, the single largest exposure
of Canadian banks, grew at a faster pace
than any other bank asset since the mid1990s (Chart) and are relatively high
compared to other countries (Chart).

noted that reviewing the government’s
exposure to the sector is on their long-term agenda. Staff argued that any structural change to
mortgage insurance should be made gradually over time, to avoid any unintended consequences
on financial stability, and welcomed the measures announced in 2013 to reduce the use of
government-backed insurance for mortgages with low loan-to-value (LTV) ratios and private
securitization programs (Box 3). Staff also recommended extending the scope of the Office of the
Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) oversight of the federally-owned Canada
Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), for example, by giving OSFI the authority to impose
greater capital or liquidity positions or prohibit the writing of new business, as this would level
the playing field with private mortgage insurers.

E. Financial Sector: Outlook, Risks, and Policies

Canada’s banking system is well capitalized, profitable, and has low nonperforming
loans (Figure 5). Canadian banks reported record profits in 2013, as greater income from fees
and wealth management and costs compression have more than offset narrower interest rate
margins from the slower growth in household loans. Tier 1 capital levels have remained high at
about 12 percent while leverage increased somewhat from 2012, and nonperforming loans are

household loan growth, especially if
this were to induce Canadian banks to expand more aggressively abroad, noting that foreign
operations account for a higher share of loan losses than of overall credit exposure (Chart). The
authorities indicated that the expansion abroad could in principle help Canadian banks diversify
risks, but also that they would need to monitor potential changes in banks’ risk appetite,
including through on-site visits. The authorities argued that they are increasing their monitoring
of Canadian banks’ exposures in tax haven countries and risks associated with money laundering,
including by planning a cross-sectoral review of a few banks in this area.
23.
The pressure on pension funds and life insurance companies eased somewhat in
2013. Higher long-term rates, strong equity markets, higher contributions as well as cuts in
benefits in some cases have led to an improvement in the solvency of Canadian defined benefit
pension funds relative to 2012. Financial results of life insurance firms have also improved in
2013, due to a pickup in income from wealth-management and insurance sales, particularly
outside Canada. Many pension funds have continued to use liability-driven investment strategies
to better match the assets and liabilities in their balance sheet. To the extent these strategies
involve leverage, they may increase returns but at the costs of exposing pension funds to other
risks, including counterparty and liquidity risks. The authorities claimed that the solvency position
of Canadian pension plans improved significantly in 2013 due to strong equity returns, rising
long-term interest rates and sponsors’ contributions to meet the minimum solvency funding
requirements for their deficits. Still, the authorities indicated they continue monitoring for signs
of excessive risk taking, also with reference to life insurance firms given the potential financial
incentives to invest in alternative, non-fixed income, assets to meet target rates of return in a low
interest rate environment.
24.
Staff welcomed the progress in the financial reform agenda since the last Article IV
consultation:
 Basel standards. Basel III regulation on capital standards was introduced in January 2013, while
the regulation on Liquidity Coverage Ratios is expected to be implemented in 2015. The
authorities expressed their intention to proceed swiftly with the implementation of Basel III

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

21

CANADA

regulations on Net Stable Funding Ratios and Leverage Ratios once they are finalized over the
course of 2014.
 Domestic Systemically Important Banks (DSIBs). The six largest banks were designated as DSIBs
by OSFI in 2013, and will therefore be subject to higher capital requirements, enhanced
supervision, and additional disclosure requirements.9 One provincially regulated financial
institution, Desjardins, was also designated as provincial systemically important institution by
the Autorité des Marchés Financiers (AMF). The authorities noted that third generation
resolution plans for the DSIBs were expected to be completed by the end of 2013 and the
fourth generations of recovery plans are expected to be submitted in 2014. They said they are
developing a new “bail-in” regime for DSIBs.
 OTC derivatives market. Staff welcomed the decision to strengthen the oversight of the OTC
derivatives market by designating LCH Clearnet’s SwapClear, the largest global central
clearing counterparty for interest rate derivatives market, as systemically important to the
Canadian financial system, given that interest rate derivatives represent three-fourths of the
notional outstanding of Canada’s OTC market.10 Moreover, in 2013 the largest provincial
securities regulators have announced plans to harmonize the rules for trade repositories and
the requirements for derivatives data reporting. This will enhance transparency in the OTC
derivatives market, and help detect possible systemic risks and market abuse.
 Repo market. Staff welcomed recent progress in expanding the functions of the central
clearing counterparty (CCP) for the Canadian repo market, a core funding market in Canada
and a source of funds for financial institutions. The authorities said that they expect to work
closely with industry to make further progress on reforms in this area throughout 2014 and
beyond, initially by broadening the participation in the repo CCP to include other significant
players in the Canadian repo market, like pension funds and insurance companies. Additional
future reforms could also include the ability to clear general-repo transactions in which any
government security can serve as collateral.
 Credit rating agencies. Further progress has been made in reducing the reliance on external
credit ratings agencies, in line with FSB principles, as the Bank of Canada established in 2013 a
credit rating assessment group to evaluate the credit risks of sovereign assets that the Bank
manages on behalf of the government. The authorities indicated that they are currently
assigning ratings to investment exposures of the government’s FX reserves to sovereigns and
that they intend to apply these for purposes of determining eligibility and investment limits in
9

DSIBs are expected to meet a 1 percent common equity surcharge by no later than January 1, 2016.

10

As a result, Bank of Canada will share the oversight of LCH Clearnet’s SwapClear with the Bank of England
(SwapClear’s lead regulator) and other national regulators (like the Federal Reserve Bank of New York) under a
multilateral arrangement for oversight cooperation. While national legislation gives Bank of Canada powers to
collect information, conduct audits and issue directives to LCH in order to preserve domestic financial stability,
the multilateral arrangement should facilitate consultation, cooperation and information-sharing between
national regulators.

22

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

2014. The Bank is also reviewing the role external credit ratings play in its collateral policy and
assessing possible options for reducing mechanistic reliance on such ratings.
25.
Staff welcomed the agreement between the Ministers of Finance of British
Columbia, Ontario and Canada to establish a cooperative capital markets regulatory
system. The system will have a federal statute that will address criminal matters, systemic risks in
capital markets and national data collection, while member provinces will adopt a uniform act
which will cover all the areas that the existing provincial securities statutes address. Staff
welcomed the initiative, which is consistent with recommendations in previous years’ staff
reports, as it is expected to reduce compliance costs and facilitate coordination across
jurisdictions and regulatory authorities, as well as to enhance systemic risk monitoring and
enforcement, especially if all provinces participated. The authorities agreed that the new system
would be more effective if all provinces joined the cooperative system, and acknowledged that
even if the federal government could in principle take measures to ensure system-wide financial
stability, it would prefer taking those measures related to capital markets within a cooperative
system.
26.
The mission and authorities discussed the scope for further strengthening Canada’s
financial system along the lines of the 2013 FSAP Update recommendations (Box 4). In
particular:


Staff argued for more clarity around the legal independence of OSFI, and suggested that
there are areas (including on the acquisition and ownership of banks, related-party
transactions and large exposures) where reporting and notification obligations for banks
could be made more formal, to ensure that OSFI has timely and complete information and
the ability to exercise its prudential powers when necessary. The authorities argued that the
current delineation of prudential responsibilities is appropriate in providing the finance
minister, who is ultimately accountable for financial stability, with a decision-taking
responsibility on transactions which may raise fundamental policy issues, and that the current
risk-based approach to supervision is more effective than rules-based approaches.



Staff emphasized that financial stability would be strengthened if all large Canadian
depository institutions, whether provincially or federally regulated, were subject to the same
level of supervision and regulation and tested against tail risks in a regular, common stress
testing exercise. The authorities noted that there is already adequate informal cooperation
between federal and provincial authorities, and that introducing more formal coordination
might undermine the incentives for provincial regulators to oversee, supervise, and provide
backstop to provincially regulated financial institutions.



Staff also argued that providing a formal mandate for macro-prudential policy to a single
entity would strengthen transparency and accountability, and reinforce Canada’s ability to
identify and respond to future crises. The authorities maintained that the current system has
served Canada well and that systemic risks are effectively analyzed within the current
informal decentralized framework. They agreed with staff, however, that systemic risk

assessment would be strengthened if additional data (on shadow banking system, securities
markets, and a number of provincially regulated financial institutions) were obtained.
Box 4. Canada: 2013 FSAP Update—Key Recommendations
Data



Expand financial sector data collection and dissemination with a view to enhancing coverage, regularity,
and availability of time-series to facilitate analysis.

Housing Finance



Reduce the government’s exposure to mortgage insurance gradually.

Stress Testing



Augment OSFI’s top-down stress testing framework for banks with risk-sensitive concepts of key credit
risk input parameters and econometric, model-based approaches using longer time series.



Include major regulated entities at federal and provincial level in a regular, common stress testing
exercise which would involve a degree of collaboration between relevant federal and provincial
authorities.

Financial Sector Oversight



Equip OSFI with powers to make its own enforceable rules by administrative means, supplementing the
use of guidelines and government regulations; amend legislation on statutory decisions to give OSFI
sole decision-making authority on prudential criteria.



Replace certain informal and ad hoc reporting requirements by federally regulated financial institutions
with more formal requirements.



Adopt a transparent and consistent regulatory regime for group-wide insurance supervision; give OSFI
the authority to take supervisory measures at the level of the holding company.



Address shortcomings in risk identification and enforcement in securities regulation.



Enhance supervisory cooperation among federal and provincial supervisors and subject all systemically
significant financial institutions to intensive supervision.

Safety Nets and Crisis Preparedness



Provide a clear mandate to an entity (i) to monitor systemic risk to facilitate macro-prudential oversight,
and (ii) to carry out system-wide crisis preparedness.



Increase the ex-ante funding of CDIC and enhance its data collection and analysis of depositor profiles.

STAFF APPRAISAL
27.
The Canadian economy strengthened in 2013 after a subdued performance in 2012,
but growth has remained modest as both exports and business investment continued to
disappoint. Growth has averaged 2.2 percent in the first three quarters of 2013, but this to a
large extent reflect the unwinding of the temporary disruptions in exports and energy
24

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CANADA

productions in the second half of 2012. Private consumption growth has remained robust, thanks
to an increase in household wealth and still easy financial conditions, but business investment
made no contribution to growth, and the volume of non-energy exports remained well below the
levels reached after earlier recessions, owing to weak external demand and increased
competiveness challenges.
28.
Monetary policy remained appropriately accommodative, while fiscal consolidation
imposed a modest drag on growth. The greater degree of economic slack contributed to
weaken inflationary pressures and the Bank of Canada kept the policy rate at 1 percent, the same
level since September 2010. The federal government’s fiscal deficit declined at a faster-thanexpected pace in 2012–13, but the impact on growth was partly offset by less restraint at other
levels of government, with a number of provinces delaying the return to a balanced budget.
Thanks to the macro-prudential measures adopted in the past, construction activity and house
price growth converged to more sustainable trends. Household credit growth also continued to
slow, but the household debt-to-income ratio reached a new high in mid-2013.
29.
Staff expects growth to accelerate to 2¼ percent in 2014, from an estimated
1¾ percent in 2013. The projected pickup in the U.S. recovery is expected to boost Canadian
exports. As final demand and capacity utilization increase, business investment is expected to
strengthen, particularly spending on machinery and equipment. Investment in the energy sector
is also projected to expand, with greater reliance on rail transportation and additional pipeline
and refining capacity expected to reduce the volatility of the price of Canadian heavy oil. Over
time, the combined additional contribution to growth from net exports and business investment
will more than offset the anticipated weakening in the contribution from household consumption
and residential investment, as households gradually reduce their debt burden, construction
activity moderates to levels consistent with demographic trends, and house price growth slows
further. Fiscal policy will remain a modest headwind, subtracting about ¼ percentage points of
GDP growth per year over the next three years. The gradual absorption of the existing economic
slack is expected to drive inflation back to 2 percent by end-2015, with the policy interest rate
projected to increase starting in early 2015.
30.
The risks around this baseline scenario are predominantly on the downside. A fasterthan-expected increase in long-term rates in the context of exit from QE could negatively affect
the U.S. recovery and hence demand for Canadian exports. Protracted weakness in the euro-area
economic recovery and lower-than-anticipated growth in emerging markets would also hurt the
prospects for Canada’s exports, including through lower commodity prices. Elevated house prices
and household leverage could amplify the growth impact of these external shocks, potentially
triggering a less friendly unwinding of domestic imbalances and further weakening of household
spending. At the same time, a stronger pickup of the US economy and better performance of
Canada’s housing sector poses upside risks to the growth outlook, although the latter would also
increase risks of a sharper correction of domestic imbalances down the road. On the domestic
front, the long period of low productivity growth and strong Canadian dollar may have left a

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

25

CANADA

deeper dent in Canada’s exports potential (especially in the traditional manufacturing base),
limiting the economy’s ability to benefit from the projected strengthening in external demand.
31.
The energy sector is a source of both upside and downside risks to the outlook. Our
baseline scenario incorporates continued growth in the exports of crude oil over the medium
term, under the assumptions that capacity constraints will be relieved through the construction
of new pipelines and U.S. demand will remain robust (with Canada gaining market share in the
U.S. oil market). A more rapid growth in U.S. production of unconventional energy and/or delays
in the expansion of transportation capacity would limit the demand for Canadian energy, put
downward pressure on Canadian energy prices, and adversely affect exports and investment. At
the same time, faster progress in solving the infrastructure bottlenecks would allow increasing
Canadian energy producers’ access to international (non U.S.) markets and Canadian eastern
provinces, boost production, and raise the price of Canadian energy. Maintaining an open regime
for inward FDI in the energy sector and addressing potential skills shortages in resource-rich
provinces would also increase the upside potential from the energy sector.
32.
Monetary policy should remain accommodative until there are firmer signs that
growth is picking up above potential, with a sustainable transition from household
spending to exports and business investment. Given the greater output gap, the low inflation
rate, well-anchored inflation expectations, and downside risks around the pickup in growth in
2014, staff’s view is that policymakers can afford to wait before starting to raise policy rates
towards more normal levels. The slowing trends in construction activity, house prices, and
household credit, together with the projected increase in long-term rates as the Fed gradually
exits from QE, also give the Bank of Canada more room to wait before raising policy rates.
Additional macro-prudential measures remain the first line of defense against a renewed
acceleration in housing imbalances, although the authorities would likely need to consider
bringing forward the tightening cycle if this acceleration were to happen in the context of
stronger growth. At the same time, the high level of household debt and elevated house prices
would limit the room for conventional monetary policy easing if growth were to disappoint.
33.
Fiscal adjustment plans should strike the right balance between supporting growth
and rebuilding the fiscal space. At the federal level, continued progress in fiscal consolidation is
appropriate to rebuild the room for fiscal maneuver used during the crisis, but there is room to
delay the adjustment needed to return to a balanced budget in 2015 if there is no meaningful
pickup in economic growth. At the provincial level, consolidation plans are facing increasing
challenges on the backdrop of disappointing economic growth, and some provinces may need to
consider additional measures, especially on the revenue side, to return to a balanced budget.
34.
Addressing long-term fiscal challenges remains an important priority. Canada has a
relatively low net public debt-to-GDP ratio compared to most other advanced economies. Still, it
is not immune to long-term spending pressures, mainly coming from population aging and
continued growth in per capita health care costs. While important steps have been taken recently
at the provincial level to limit health care spending growth, it is important to ensure that the
recent moderation is maintained into the future and the savings are obtained through efficiency
26

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CANADA

gains in addition to budgetary restrictions. Establishing independent budget offices at the
provincial level (as in the case of Ontario’s Financial Accountability Office) and having them
publish long-term fiscal sustainability analysis would help raise public awareness of the
challenges ahead, and build consensus around the needed policy measures. The mission
welcomed the recently announced intention by the federal government to introduce a rule
requiring balancing the budget in normal economic times, as this would allow locking in recent
progress in deficit reduction, but it would be important to design it in a way that avoids
imposing a pro-cyclical bias to fiscal policy. Federal and especially energy-abundant provincial
jurisdictions should also consider changing their fiscal frameworks to better manage the volatility
associated with commodity prices and save the revenue windfall. In this regard, Alberta’s recently
legislated fiscal framework is a step in the right direction.
35.
Over the long run, the need for extensive government backed mortgage insurance
should be re-examined. The current system has its advantages, including as a macro-prudential
tool. However, it exposes the fiscal budget to financial system risks and might distort the
allocation of resources in favor of mortgages and away from more productive uses of capital.
Against this background, the government’s recent initiatives to impose limits on governmentbacked mortgage insurance have been appropriate. Looking ahead, further measures should be
considered to encourage appropriate risk retention by the private sector and increase the market
share of private mortgage insurers. Importantly, any structural change should be made gradually
over time to avoid any unintended consequence on financial stability.
36.
While Canada’s financial sector is healthy, it is essential to remain vigilant against
the potential risks from the prolonged period of low interest rates. Canada’s banking system
is characterized by elevated capitalization, strong profitability, and high quality of assets. Stress
tests conducted as part of the recent IMF FSAP mission demonstrate the resilience of major
Canadian banks and insurance companies to credit, liquidity, and contagion risks arising from a
severe stress scenario. Pension funds and life insurance companies appear to have coped well
with a prolonged period of low interest rates, although their increased reliance on nontraditional investment strategies continues to deserve close scrutiny from regulators. Continued
expansion abroad of both Canadian banks and life insurance companies, while contributing to
diversification, also calls for enhanced monitoring.
37.
Staff welcomes the progress made by the authorities on the international financial
reform agenda over the past year. Basel III capital standards were introduced in 2013 and the
authorities plan to introduce Basel III liquidity standards in 2015. The six largest federally
regulated deposit-taking financial institutions have been designated as systemically important by
OSFI and one provincially regulated institution has been designated as provincially systemically
important by AMF and will be therefore subject to higher capital standard requirements, in
addition to enhanced disclosure, supervisory and recovery and resolution planning requirements.
Significant progress has been made towards strengthening the resilience of the repo market by
expanding the functions of the central counterparty established in 2012. To enhance the safety
and soundness of OTC derivatives market, the largest global central counterparty for the OTC

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CANADA

interest rate derivatives market was designated for oversight because of its systemic importance
to the Canadian financial system. The recent agreement among two major provinces and the
federal government to establish a cooperative capital markets regulator could prove a useful
step in further harmonizing securities market regulation and oversight nationally.
38.
There are a few areas where the resilience of Canadian financial sector could be
strengthened further. Canada’s compliance with international standards for regulation and
supervision of banks and insurers is strong. Still, staff called for more clarity around the legal
independence of OSFI and for assigning stronger prudential responsibilities to this regulator. The
mission also saw room for stronger coordination across federal and provincial authorities in both
the supervision and stress-testing of large depository institutions, whether provincially or
federally regulated. It also suggested that a clear mandate could be given to an entity to carry
out macro-prudential oversight, with participation broad enough to allow a complete view of
systemic risks across all financial institutions and markets, and with powers to collect the data
required for the analysis of systemic risks.
39.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard
12-month cycle.

Staff estimates that house prices are still overvalued on a national
basis, though less than before.

Weaker construction activity mainly reflects a softening in multi-unit
constructions, where there are more signs of overbuilding.

Table 1. Canada: Risk Assessment Matrix 1/

The main risk is from a faster-than-expected increase in U.S. long-term rates, as

the U.S. recovery. Even if this were to happen in the context of stronger U.S.
economic growth, the net impact on Canadian output would be negative if the
increase in U.S. interest rates were to lead to a sharp and persistent increase in
mortgage rates in Canada as well as a faster decline in house prices than currently in
our baseline scenario (see Annex I for details).
Low/Medium
This could impact Canada mainly through indirect trade channels, although domestic
demand would also be affected through negative confidence effects and tighter

Europe

financial conditions. In a scenario where European GDP falls by about 3½ percent
below baseline after 5 years of slow growth, with higher debt accumulation forcing
more fiscal consolidation and higher cost of capital, output in Canada would fall by
about 0.4 percent after 5 years, mainly because of a smaller contribution from net
exports (see Annex I).
Medium
This shock would affect Canada through a negative effect on the terms of trade (as

economies

although the weakening of the Canadian dollar would soften the impact. Staff
simulations show that a 10 percent two-year decline of investment in major emerging
market economies (that leads to a fall in global GDP by about 2 percent, and a
decline in energy prices of about 10 percent per year over the two-year horizon)
would subtract about 0.35 percent from Canada’s output on average over two years
(see Annex I).
High
A sustained decline in energy prices would substantially impact Canada through
reducing production and investment in the energy sector, and via the negative terms
of trade shock. An intensification of hydraulic fracturing activity in the U.S. energy

sector and delays in pipeline projects may also pose downside risks to Canada. Staff
simulations show that in a scenario where infrastructure constraints persist and crude
oil production growth slows (to below 2 percent per year over 2014–2020, compared
to 3 percent growth in staff’s baseline scenario), Canada’s real GDP would be
2 percent lower in the long run (see Selected Issues paper).

1/ The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in
the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline. The
RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non mutually
exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.

Annex I. Canada’s Trade and Financial Linkages and Risk
Scenarios
Inward Spillovers: Trade Channels
1.
Canada’s trade remains tightly linked to the United States but trade spillovers from
emerging markets have become more important. Canada’s merchandise exports remain
predominantly directed to the United States, although the U.S. share of Canadian exports has
steadily declined from about 85 percent in 2003 to 75 percent in 2012. In terms of the product mix,
manufacturing as a whole still accounts for about two-thirds of Canada’s merchandise exports in
2012, but energy has taken over

and services growth after one year. Canada
also became more exposed to emerging markets, mainly through their substantial impact on
commodity prices. As stated in the 2012 Article IV Consultation Staff Report (IMF Country Report No.
13/40), Canada is particularly exposed to fluctuations in China’s fixed asset investment given its high
commodity-intensity: a one-percentage point decline in China’s fixed asset investment growth could
reduce Canada’s export growth by up to ¼ percentage point.
Inward Spillovers: Financial Channels
2.
Canada’s financial linkages with the United States are also particularly strong. As of
2013:Q2, Canadian banks’ consolidated

compared to other advanced economies, with U.S. banks holding about 30 percent of total foreign
claims, closely followed by U.K. banks.
3.
Canadian corporations and banks have increasingly raised debt abroad, particularly in
the United States. From 2007 to 2012, the foreign ownership share of Canada’s overall stock of
debt securities has increased sharply (IMF 2013 Spillover Report). Canadian banks have also
increasingly tapped the U.S. wholesale funding market: the Canadian banks’ share of U.S. prime
money market funds has almost doubled from 6.5 percent of their total assets in August 2011 to
11 percent in April 2013. The three largest Canadian life insurance companies also have significant
foreign operations, with the U.S. market nearly matching the Canadian market in terms of gross
insurance liabilities.
Risk Scenarios
4.
Model-based simulations suggest that tighter-than-expected financial conditions in
the United States are unlikely to affect Canada negatively if they occur in the context of
stronger U.S. economic recovery. The 2013 Spillover Report presented three scenarios in which the
Fed tightens monetary policy earlier and faster than in our baseline. In the first two scenarios this
happens in response to higher-than-expected growth, and long-term rates either remain anchored
(that is, they rise in line with standard expectations theory) or increase by a further 100 basis points
(bps) for a year following a term premium shock, with interest rates rising in other countries in line
with historical correlations. In both cases, the net impact on Canada’s output is positive, as the trade
gains from higher exports to the United States and currency depreciations with respect to the U.S.
dollar more than compensate the negative impact of tighter financial conditions on private domestic
demand. In the third scenario, however, the monetary policy tightening occurs despite a lack of
growth momentum in the United States, and the net impact on Canadian output is negative.1
5.
But elevated household leverage and overvalued house prices are a source of
vulnerability. The models used in the 2013 Spillover Report do not have any role for house prices
and household leverage, and therefore may underestimate the impact of the shocks on Canada. To
control for this, we tweak the IMF’s Global Integrated Monetary and Fiscal (GIMF) model and G35-S
model so that they include a house price and

debt service shocks. Specifically, we consider

This may happen out of concern for rising financial risks, because the excess supply in the U.S. turns out to be lower
than previously thought (as explored in the April 2013 WEO with GIMF simulations), or simply because of policy
mistakes.

faster-than-expected pace and U.S. long-term interest rate increase, peaking at about 150 basis
points above baseline in 2014:Q4. Canadian long-term interest rates increase as well, peaking at
75 basis points above baseline in 2014:Q3. Tighter financial conditions are assumed to lead to a
10 percent decline of Canadian house prices over one year. Assuming that the output elasticity
to a 1 percent decline in house prices is 0.12 (as in Igan and Loungani, 2012, IMF WP/12/217),
the simulation results from the G35-S model indicate that the negative financial shock and
positive trade shock broadly offset each other, and Canada’s output remains largely unchanged
in 2014. Greater response of house prices to tighter financial conditions and/or greater output
sensitivity to the decline of house prices would tilt the balance toward a net negative impact on
Canada (Table).
 A financial tightening in the U.S. with a debt-service shock and house price decline in Canada.
This scenario is similar to the previous one, but adds a debt service shock to Canadian
households within the GIMF model setup. Following the more rapid acceleration of U.S.
domestic demand, U.S. nominal market interest rate begins to increase in 2014 and peaks at
about 300 basis points above baseline in 2016. As growth accelerates, monetary policy is
tightened in Canada, and the market

decline in house prices force household
to increase saving and lower private consumption, while the increase in the cost of capital hurts
investment growth. Despite exports benefiting from the stronger external demand and lower
Canadian dollar, Canadian output would be slightly lower in 2014 and 2015 (by about ⅓ and ½
percent, respectively) (Chart).
6.
Hard landing in emerging markets or prolonged slow growth in the euro area could
also adversely affect Canada. We considered two scenarios:

2

These estimates are based on staff’s calculations of the average Canadian household’s monthly mortgage service
payments, based on a five-year mortgage at an interest rate of 4 percent. Thus, a 100 basis point increase in interest
rates would raise the debt service burden by about 3¼ percent of disposable income. Assuming no new borrowing,
households would need a commensurate cut in private consumption. Assuming that about one-third of mortgages
are rolled over each year, the reduction in private consumption-to-GDP ratio takes place gradually, reaching
2 percentage points in 2016.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND



A significant but temporary slowdown in emerging markets resulting from weaker investment
coupled with capital outflows. In this scenario, private investment demand in the BRICS
economies falls 10 percent in one year. Furthermore, all emerging markets experience capital
outflows, resulting in long-term interest rate increases of 200 basis points in China and India,
and 400 basis points in Brazil, Russia, and South Africa, while equity prices fall 40 percent in all of
these countries. These shocks are transmitted to Canada mainly through the indirect trade
channel, as global GDP falls about 2 percent per year over a two year horizon, and the terms of
trade channels, as energy commodity prices decrease by 10 percent after one year. Under this
scenario, Canada’s GDP falls by about 0.35 percent on average over a two year period, although
the contribution to output from net exports remains close to the baseline as the exchange rate
depreciation partly offsets the negative impact of lower external demand.



A gradual but persistent deterioration in euro area growth. In this scenario, investment in the euro
area falls 3 percent below the baseline in the first year and an additional 5 percent in the
following year, as a result of the debt overhang on firms’ balance sheets. The impact on output
from lower investment is compounded by the knock-on effects to private consumption, as
employment declines. Higher debt-to-GDP ratios in the euro area lead to further increases in
sovereign and corporate spreads (25 bps and 12.5 bps on average across the euro area,
respectively, each year for 5 years), additional fiscal tightening, and credit contraction. Risk
premia rise in advanced economies by one-tenth of the increase in the average euro area, with
emerging market risk premium rising by one-quarter. At the end of the 5-year period, GDP is
about 3½ percent below baseline for Europe, 1¼ percent for the world, and 0.4 percent in
Canada, mainly because of the indirect trade channel, as the smaller contribution from net
exports accounts for two-thirds of the decline.

Outward Spillovers
7.
Outward spillovers to the Caribbean could be substantial given Canadian banks’
dominant presence in the region. A network analysis (Ohnsorge, 2013) based on the BIS banking
statistics, indicates that while Canada’s
banking system has significant crossborder linkages to eight partner
countries, it is unlikely to generate broad
outward spillovers given that that most
of these countries are not strongly
interconnected among themselves
(Chart). But Canadian banks are a
potential source of significant spillovers
for a number of Caribbean countries,
where they have a dominant market
position (Chart). For example, Canadian

42

banks account for about 60 percent of the ECCU’s banking system assets. Changes in Canada’s
economic conditions can also affect Caribbean islands through tourism, as Canada is the second
most important source country of tourism flows to the region, after the United States.

has translated into lower prices for Canada’s heavy oil. As a result, the spread between the price of
the Western Canadian Select (WCS), Canada’s main heavy crude oil blend for exports, and the price
of the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) more than doubled in the last 5 years. Market access
limitations have cost Canada an estimated ½ percent of GDP or about 2 percent of exports revenues
per year.
Canada: Net Capital Inflows

2.
Canada’s current account deficits
continued to be largely financed by
foreign purchases of Canadian debt
securities. Over 2009–13, average annual
net portfolio inflows (debt and equity)
amounted to 4 percent of GDP, against net
outflows of 2 percent of GDP in 2000–07
(Chart). Net FDI and other investment
inflows have remained mostly negative
since 2008. Recent portfolio inflows have
been concentrated in debt securities, which

enjoyed strong global demand mainly owing to Canada’s relatively healthy corporate and
government balance sheet positions. As the U.S. tapering talk picked up steam in 2013, inflows into
the Canadian debt markets have moderated, both on a gross and net basis. Canada’s net external
liabilities stood at about 3½ percent of GDP as of end-September 2013, mainly reflecting an
increase in the net equity position, while the net debt position has changed little since end-2012.
Canada’s gross external debt of 77 percent of GDP as of end-2012 is relatively low compared to
other advanced economies and is a modest vulnerability.
3.
Staff estimates suggest that the current account is weaker, and the real exchange rate
is stronger than implied by medium-term fundamentals. Results from the IMF’s External Balance
Assessment (EBA), based on data available as of November 2013, indicate that Canada’s mediumterm current account (CA) should be between -1 and 0 percent of GDP, while the real effective
exchange rate (REER) should be between 5 and 15 percent below the average level over the period
between January and October 2013. In particular: 1


EBA regression-based estimates suggest that the CA “norm”—the current account consistent
with medium-term economic fundamentals and appropriate domestic and foreign policies—
is a surplus of 0.2 percent of GDP. Importantly, most of the difference between the current
(cyclically-adjusted) CA balance and the CA norm derives from the fact that the EBA CA
regression can only partially replicate the actual dynamics of Canada’s CA. Only a very small
portion of the gap is explained by differences in policies in Canada and other countries from
“appropriate” levels.



The EBA external stability approach finds that a current account deficit of 0.9 percent of GDP
would be enough to stabilize the ratio of Canada’ net foreign asset to GDP over the medium
term.



Based on staff’s estimated relationship between the current account and the real effective
exchange rate (REER) for Canada, the two EBA estimates above suggest that Canada’s REER
should fall between 5 and 15 percent. EBA regressions-based estimates suggest that the size
of the REER overvaluation is about 10 percent.

4.
A few factors can explain the CA gap for Canada. First, the EBA may overestimate the CA
norm for Canada as the adjustment for the business cycle is done using Canada’s output gap
relative to the world (GDP-weighted average) output gap, while a more relevant measure for Canada
is the gap relative to the United States. As the latter is currently larger, the regression may be
underestimating Canada’s CA improvement as the U.S. output returns to potential. Second, the oil
trade balance and the terms of trade variables are both likely to be biased upward for Canada, as
the EBA uses the WEO global oil prices rather than the lower market price for Canadian oil. To the
extent the difference is due to infrastructure bottlenecks, adding transportation capacity over the
medium term should help closing the CA gap. Finally, while the CA regression captures safe-haven

capital inflows using the country’s currency share in the total stock of world reserves, a large part of
recent purchases of Canadian assets have come from the United States, and thus implied a relatively
small change in the Canadian dollar share in world reserves. To the extent that recent capital inflows
to Canada were a temporary reflection of a high interest rate differential with the United States, a
reduction of capital inflows over the next few years should also help close the CA gap, by lowering
upward pressures on the Canadian exchange rate.

Annex III. Long-Term Fiscal Sustainability
1.
This Annex presents an update of staff assessment of the long-term sustainability of
Canada’s public finances at the general government level.1 Projections over the medium term
(2013–18) are based on macroeconomic and fiscal projections contained in Tables 3 and 4,
respectively. Projections for 2019–50 are derived as follows:


Revenues are expected to remain constant as a share of GDP, that is, to grow at the same pace
as nominal potential GDP (about 4 percent annually).



Federal transfers to provinces follow the current growth rate set up by the federal
government, i.e. Canadian Health Transfers and Equalization Transfers grow at the 3-year
moving average of nominal GDP growth; the Canada Social Transfer at a 3 percent annual
nominal growth; and other transfers at nominal GDP growth. Overall, transfers from the federal
to provincial governments are projected to slightly moderate as a share of GDP, from 4.2
percent of GDP in 2012 to about 4 percent by 2030.



Health care spending projections are based on staff’s calculations and IMF (2013).2 These
projections are obtained assuming that the current structure of health care spending per age
group is constant over the forecasting horizon (CIHI, 2011). Each age group is then assumed to
grow based on the “medium-growth”

productivity growth (1.1 percent), in line with the average health care Excess Cost Growth (ECG)

projected to grow from 7.5 percent of GDP in 2012 to almost 12 percent by 2050, with
population aging and ECG expected to contribute equally to the increase until 2030, while ECG
is the main driver of growth thereafter. However, this scenario fails to take into account the
significant slowdown of health care spending over the last few years discussed in Box 2. On

average over the last 5 years (and excluding the year of the recession, 2009) health care ECG has
been 0.12 percentage points, reflecting a combination of budgetary restrictions and efficiency
gains. If the same ECG was maintained over the whole forecasting period, health care spending
would grow to 9.5 percent of GDP by 2050. By contrast, an acceleration of the ECG to the high
levels recorded in the 2000s before the recession (the high growth scenario with ECG at
1.27 percentage points) would bring health care spending to 15 percent of GDP in 2050.

Pension expenditures are based on
the latest actuarial reports of the
Offices of the Chief Actuary for the CPP
(2013) and QPP (2011). For the CPP,
they show that the legislated
contribution rate of 9.9 percent is
sufficient to fund future outlays, while
for the QPP contribution rates would
need to increase 1.12 percentage
points to ensure long-term funding. In
our projections we assume the
increase is implemented, and so both
CPP and QPP balances are kept
constant over the projection horizon.
Elderly benefits are projected based on
the assumption that benefit payments
are indexed to inflation only and
reflecting the legislated increase in age

Financial assets are set to gradually return to their long-term trends after 2018 (about 30
percent of GDP for provincial, territorial, and local governments, and 10 percent for the federal
government). We also assume the effective return on financial assets and debt service costs to
gradually return to historical averages (Chart).

2.
Based on these assumptions, the general government’s net-debt-to GDP ratio will
reach 60 percent of GDP by 2050, driven by a deterioration of the provincial fiscal position. In
our baseline scenario, the general government net debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to decline slightly
from 2017 before starting to move upward by end-2020s. The overall fiscal position is the result of
very different dynamics at the federal and provincial level:

3.
Even if provinces were able to contain health care ECG going forward, their debt
position would still remain unsustainable. In a scenario in which ECG is kept at 0.12 percentage
points for the whole forecasting period, provinces’ net debt would still increase rapidly as a share of
GDP, reaching about 65 percent by 2050.
4.
Further efforts would thus be needed to put the provincial debt-to-GDP ratio on a
sustainable path. Staff estimates that if provinces were able to reach a primary balance of 0.5
percent of GDP by 2020 and keep it thereafter, their net debt-to-GDP ratio would return to current
levels by 2030. This is consistent with overall annual spending growing at 3½ percent on average
over the 2014–2020 period, and at potential GDP afterwards, compared to 4 percent and
4¾ percent respectively, in the baseline scenario.

Annex IV. Public Debt Sustainability Analysis1
Canada’s general government gross debt is expected to peak at 89 percent of GDP in 2013 and to
decline thereafter under staff’s baseline scenario. Government financial assets are sizeable in Canada
and represent about 50 percent of GDP, which put the net debt-to-GDP ratio close to 40 percent as of
2013. Gross financing needs are relatively large, but are expected to be below 20 percent of GDP by
2015. The general government debt position is relatively resilient to a series of macro and fiscal shocks
in the medium term.



Primary balance shock. A scenario
involving a deterioration of the structural primary balance of about 1 percent of GDP over the
next two years has the gross debt-to-GDP ratio rising to 89½ percent by 2015 and gradually
returning to baseline by 2018. The risk premium on sovereigns is assumed to increase by 25 bps
for each 1 percent of GDP slippage, with little effects on the debt path.



Growth shock. A lower real output growth by 1 standard deviation for 2 years starting in 2014
would have a significant impact on the level of gross debt, which will reach 93 percent of GDP in
2015. The deterioration in the primary balance would be minor given current consolidation
plans, and the debt-to-GDP ratio would remain on a downward path over the projection period.



Interest rate shock. An increase in sovereign risk premia by 200 bps for two years would raise
the government’s interest bill by about 0.5 percent by 2015 (about 96 percent of outstanding
marketable debt is in fixed coupon bonds). Higher borrowing costs would slow the decrease in
the debt-to-GDP ratio, which ends up 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline in 2018, at
around 85 percent.



Exchange rate shock. If the exchange rate depreciates by about 15 percent (the upper limit of
its estimated overvaluation range, see Annex II) the fiscal impact is minimal—almost 90 percent

of Canada’s outstanding marketable debt instruments are in Canadian dollar, and both federal
and sub-national governments usually hedge their FX exposures.


Combined macro-fiscal shock. In a scenario with all the above shocks combined, the gross
debt-to-GDP ratio rises to about 95 percent of GDP by 2015 but is back on a downward—
though slower—trend by the end of the forecasting horizon. Gross financing needs fall below
the 20 percent benchmark by 2017 only, but are down to 17 percent of GDP in 2018.



Commodity price shock. Lower than expected commodity prices, by 7 percent on average over
the forecasting horizon would increase the gross debt to 95 percent of GDP in 2015.2 The ratio
would then stabilize at this level over the forecast horizon.

The sizable general government liquid financial assets represent a mitigating factor for
Canada’s high gross debt and financing needs. In all the above scenarios, Canada’s gross debt
rises above 85 percent of GDP and the gross financing needs go above 25 percent of GDP in at least
one of the following years (see the heat

expected to decline significantly over the
next two years as the large loan (about 3 percent of GDP) from the federal government to the
federal government-owned Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation under the Insured
Mortgage Purchasing Program will be fully repaid.
In addition, Canada’s gross and net public debt have increased in recent years due to
Canadian government policy to fund public sector employee pension plans by raising market
debt. Unfunded pension liabilities of the public sector are excluded here from Canada’s general
government debt, to improve consistency with other countries that do not report these liabilities.
However, because Canada has funded part of its pension liabilities since 2000, those liabilities are
reflected in its public debt.

This scenario is based and benchmarked on the 2012 Federal budget revisions.

is on a 12-month consultation cycle.
The 2013 Article IV discussions were conducted in Toronto, Calgary, and Ottawa from
November 12–26, 2013, by Roberto Cardarelli (head), Lusine Lusinyan, Julien Reynaud (all WHD),
Ivo Krznar (MCM), and Minsuk Kim (SPR). Messrs. Alejandro Werner and Gian Maria MilesiFerretti (both WHD) and Simon Gray (MCM) joined the mission for the concluding meetings with
Minister of Finance Flaherty and Bank of Canada Governor Poloz in Ottawa on November 26.
Mr. Antoine Brunelle-Cote (Senior Advisor) attended the meetings, and Mr. Thomas Hockin
(Executive Director) participated in some of the meetings. A press conference was held on
November 27 in Toronto. Outreach activities included discussions with private sector and trade
union representatives and think tanks.
FSSA Participation and ROSC Assessments
Canada–Financial System Stability Assessment–
Volume II: Report on Observance of Standards in
the Financial System

www.imf.org
June 30, 2000

Summary: The FSSA report concluded that Canada has a stable and highly advanced
financial system, which is among the soundest in the world. It is supported by a welldeveloped regulatory system that shows a high degree of compliance with major
international standards. The FSSA report made a few recommendations to further
strengthen the regulatory framework and financial system’s resilience, most of which
have already been addressed, including:


Introducing capital requirements for the guarantees in life insurance segregated
fund (completed by end-2001);



Tabling legislation granting the Office of the Superintendent of Financial
Institutions (OSFI) powers to remove a financial institution’s director or senior
officer if the person is deemed not suitable to hold that office based on a number
of criteria. The latter legislation brought Canada into broad compliance with the
Basel Core Principles;



Making significant progress in harmonizing securities regulation and improving
coordination among provincial securities regulators, including through a newly

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 3

CANADA

created association of securities regulators, the Canadian Securities
Administrators. Although there remain multiple regulators at the provincial level,
a Senate commission was created to develop specific recommendations on
further harmonization and streamlining of securities regulation.

Canada: Report on the Observance of Standards
and Codes—Fiscal Transparency Module

IMF Country Report
No. 02/51, 03/12/02

Summary: The report found that fiscal management in Canada meets the requirements
of the fiscal transparency code, and in a number of instances represents best practice. In
particular, it highlighted the use of private sector economic forecasts. Fiscal management
was also commended for its statistical integrity, impartial tax administration, open
procurement, and a transparent regulatory process.
The report found several areas where further improvements would be desirable,
including: (i) the preparation of timely, current year estimates of federal and provincial
budgets on a comparable basis, (ii) a comprehensive account of the procedures for the
budget cycle and expenditure management system, (iii) systematic reporting of the use
of reserves for non-economic contingencies, (iv) resumption of publication of reconciled
national and public accounts forecasts of major aggregates over the forecast horizon,
and (v) publication by all governments of quasi-fiscal activities.
Many of these issues have been addressed, including: (i) the release by Statistics Canada
of consolidated data for federal and provincial budgets for 2001–02 (on a Financial
Management System basis); (ii) the publication of comprehensive descriptions of budget
and expenditure management procedures, including a joint document entitled
“Budgeting in Canada” by the Government and the OECD, detailed accounts of policies
and procedures on expenditure management at the website of the Treasury Board
Secretariat, and the explanation of the budget cycle and process in Budget and Update
documents; and (iii) publication of reconciled national and public accounts forecasting.
Canada: Report on the Observance of Standards
and Codes—Data Module

IMF Country Report
No. 03/328, 10/23/03

Summary: Canada’s macroeconomic statistics are comprehensive, timely, and accurate
and thus adequate to conduct effective surveillance of economic and financial policies.
Official institutions responsible for the compilation and dissemination of the
macroeconomic datasets are supported by adequate legal and institutional frameworks.
These frameworks protect confidentiality and ensure that statistical work is conducted
within a quality assurance program and with sufficient resources. Integrity is ensured by
the professionalism of the staff, transparency in statistical policies and practices, and the
provision of ethical guidelines for staff. Compilers generally follow internationally
accepted guidelines in the production of the macroeconomic statistics, which is well-

4

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CANADA

supported by excellent efforts to develop source data that facilitate a high degree of
accuracy and reliability. Statistics are generally relevant, well documented, available with
good frequency on a timely basis, and readily accessible to users, who trust them as
objective.
While recognizing the high quality of the macroeconomic data, the report makes
recommendations to further strengthen the statistical system, most of which are already
being addressed, including these priorities:


Articulate the roles of Statistics Canada and the Bank of Canada in producing
financial sector statistics and explore possibilities for more data sharing of monetary
and financial statistics;



Estimate consumption of fixed capital at replacement cost rather than historic costs
now used for the corporate sector in the Canadian System of National Accounts
(CSNA);



Disseminate information on the sources and methods used in compiling quarterly
public sector statistics for the quarterly CSNA; and



Reclassify certain transactions that are not recorded in line with the 5th edition of the
Balance of Payments Manual (BPM5).

Canada: Report on the Observance of Standards
and Codes––FATF Recommendations for AntiMoney Laundering and Combating the Financing
of Terrorism

IMF Country Report
No. 08/372, 12/11/08

Summary: Canada underwent a detailed FATF evaluation of its anti-money laundering
and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) framework in 2007. Shortcomings
were identified with respect to the scope of customer due diligence, AML/CFT
supervision, and the Canadian financial intelligence unit. Since then, a number of steps
have been taken to strengthen the framework in these three areas, resulting in significant
improvements.
Canada: Financial System Stability AssessmentUpdate

IMF Country Report
No. 08/59, 02/13/08

Summary: The FSSA update concluded that Canada’s financial system is mature,
sophisticated, and well-managed. Financial stability was underpinned by sound
macroeconomic policies and strong prudential regulation and supervision, and welldesigned deposit insurance and arrangements for crisis management and failure
resolution. The banking system appeared sound, with stress tests showing that the major
banks could withstand sizeable shocks, although they did faces some challenges related
to the global financial turmoil that started in mid-2007. Also, there were some concerns

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 5

CANADA

about bank attempts to build on their secure domestic position, to enter highly
competitive foreign markets or complex activities. The update reiterated the advantages
of moving towards a single securities regulator, including the streamlining of policy
development, reductions in compliance costs, and improved enforcement. However, it
also recognized the significant improvements to the regulatory system from the creation
of the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA), and the implementation of the passport
system.
Canada: Financial System Stability AssessmentUpdate

IMF Country Report
No. 14/XX, 01/29/14

Summary: The FSSA Update found that Canada’s financial system successfully navigated
the global financial crisis, and stress tests suggest that major Canadian financial
institutions are resilient to credit, liquidity, and contagion risks arising from a severe stress
scenario. Elevated house prices and high household debt remain an area of concern
(despite the substantial level of government-guaranteed mortgage insurance), though
targeted prudential and macroprudential measures are proving to be effective. The
regulatory and supervisory framework demonstrates strong compliance with international
standards. Nevertheless, the Update called for more clarity around the legal
independence of OSFI and for assigning stronger prudential responsibilities to this
regulator. In the securities markets, provincial regulators and the federal government have
made significant progress in implementing a robust and harmonized framework, but
challenges remain in enforcement, risk identification, and timely policy making. The FSSA
Update argued that the federal system of safety nets is credible, although there is no
single body with an explicit mandate to take a comprehensive view of systemic risks or to
undertake crisis preparedness. Improving cooperation between federal and provincial
authorities would further reinforce system-wide oversight arrangements.
Technical Assistance: Not Applicable.
Resident Representative: Not Applicable.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
The quality, coverage, periodicity, and timeliness of Canada’s economic data are considered to be
adequate both in the context of the Article IV consultation and for purposes of ongoing surveillance.
Canada has subscribed to the Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS), and its metadata
are posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB). The data ROSC was
published on October 23, 2003.
Real Sector. Statistics Canada provides timely and adequate data in monthly, quarterly, and annual
frequency thereby facilitating the analyses of economic developments and policy assessments within

6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CANADA

a quantitative macroeconomic framework. In May 2001, Statistics Canada effected a smooth
transition from Laspeyres methodology for estimating real expenditure-based GDP to Fisher index
formulae, which enabled more accurate comparison between Canada and other G-7 countries. In
October 2012, Statistics Canada started aligning the Canadian System of National Accounts (CSNA)
with the SNA2008 international standard. The changes introduced in the CSNA2012 included,
among others, capitalization of research and development, move to replacement cost-based
valuation of consumption of fixed capital, and valuing equity more consistently at market price.
Reflecting resource constraints and data availability, the SNA2008 is planned to be implemented in a
staggered way. Additional changes are planned with the 2014 release of the CSNA, which however
for the most part will not have a significant impact on GDP and represent the development of new
accounts, improved integration between the CSNA and Government Finance Statistics, additional
detail, and presentational changes that better align with international standards (see, Statistics
Canada).
Fiscal Sector. Statistics Canada provides quarterly data (a Statement of Government Operations
along with a Balance Sheet) on the general government and its subsectors following the
Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001) recommendations. In addition, the
Department of Finance Canada provides monthly and annual data on the federal government’s
budget (according to the national presentation) and tax policies. The provided data enable adequate
assessment of the impact of fiscal policy measures on Canada’s economic performance.
Financial Sector. The Bank of Canada and OSFI provide monthly and quarterly data on the broad
range of financial variables. However, the 2013 FSSA Update recommended that financial sector
data collection and dissemination should be expanded with a view to enhancing coverage,
regularity, and availability of time-series to facilitate analysis.
Monetary Sector. The Bank of Canada provides timely and adequate coverage of daily, weekly,
monthly, and quarterly data related to the monetary sector.
External Sector. Statistics Canada provides timely information on a quarterly frequency on the
balance of payments, external debt, and the international investment position. Department of
Finance Canada provides monthly data on Official International Reserves in a format comparable to
the IMF’s reserve data template, thus enabling adequate surveillance. Data are published at
http://www.fin.gc.ca/pub/oir-ro-eng.asp.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on Canada
January 29, 2014

1.
This note reports on information that has become available since the staff report
(SM/14/19) was issued and does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
Recent economic indicators suggest that economic activity is picking up
somewhat. Canadian manufacturing sales increased for the third month in a row in
November 2013, at a faster pace than market expectations, with motor vehicle sales reaching
the highest level (in nominal terms) since November 2007. The Bank of Canada’s Winter
Business Outlook Survey suggests that the export and investment outlook is gradually
improving, although weak demand and domestic uncertainty continue to limit sales
expectations and expansion plans. As a result, business investment is expected to focus on
shorter-term projects and upgrading of existing capacity. For the labor market, the year ended
on a weaker note, as unemployment rate increased to 7.2 percent in December, after holding
steady at 6.9 percent in September–November. However, monthly labor statistics have been
volatile, and job creation trended up on a quarterly basis in 2013:Q4. Staff continues to
expect unemployment rate to average about 6.9 percent in 2014.
3.
Activity in the Canadian housing sector continued to moderate, in line with staff
projections. Home sales fell in December (-1.8 percent, m/m), the third consecutive monthly
decline, and stood at close to 2012 levels on an annual basis. The number of newly listed
homes fell 4.3 percent (m/m) in December, and year-end listings were somewhat below the
2012 figures. House prices rose 4.3 percent (y/y) in December, led by increases in Calgary
and Greater Toronto area. Construction activity continued to moderate, with housing starts
declining to around 188,000 units in 2013, down from 215,000 in 2012. The steady growth in
the number of completed and unabsorbed units in 2013 (reaching 212,000 units, up from
190,000 units in 2012) suggest the excess supply of housing should put downward pressures
on house prices in the coming years.
4.
On January 22, as widely expected, the Bank of Canada left the overnight rate
unchanged at 1 percent, emphasizing the downside risks to inflation. While lowering the
projected path of inflation in 2014 (from 1½ percent forecasted in October to 1¼ percent),
the Bank still expects total and core inflation measures to remain below the 2 percent target
until 2015:Q4 (similar to staff’s projections). Noting the improved growth in 2013:H2, the
Bank revised up its 2013 growth forecast for Canada (to 1.8 percent from 1.6 percent in
October forecast) but stressed the lack of signs of rebalancing towards exports and
investment. Backed by a stronger outlook for the U.S. recovery, the Bank revised up its
projection of Canada’s growth in 2014 (to 2.5 percent from 2.3 percent), driven by a higher
contribution from net exports. Markets appear to have interpreted the monetary policy
statement as moderately more dovish, and the Canadian dollar and bond yields weakened in
the wake of the release. Analysts continue to expect interest rates to remain on hold until
2015, with some expecting the tightening cycle to begin in as late as the second half of 2015.

Press Release No. 14/39
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
February 3, 2014

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation with Canada
On January 29, 2014, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Canada.1
The Canadian economy strengthened in 2013 after a subdued performance in 2012, but the
underlying growth has remained modest. The composition of growth does not yet point to the
much needed rebalancing from household consumption and residential construction towards
exports and business investment. In particular, despite the depreciating exchange rate, nonenergy exports remained well below the levels reached after earlier recessions. These low export
levels reflect not only the slower recovery in external demand but also increased challenges to
competitiveness. Thanks to rising household wealth and still easy financial conditions, private
consumption growth remained robust, but the household debt-to-income ratio reached a new
historical high in the second half of 2013. The housing market has cooled, owing in part to
macro-prudential measures adopted in the past, but house prices remain overvalued, although
with important regional differences.
Economic growth is expected to accelerate to 2¼ percent in 2014, up from an estimated 1¾
percent in 2013. Canada’s export growth should benefit from the projected pick-up in U.S.
growth in 2014, boosting business investment. Over time, a higher contribution to growth from
net exports and business investment is expected to more than offset the slowdown in private
consumption and residential investment. There are, however, still significant downside risks to
the outlook, from an overshooting of long-term interest rates following the Fed’s exit from
quantitative easing that would hinder the pick-up in economic activity in the United States,
protracted weakness in the euro area growth, and lower-than-expected growth in emerging
markets which could also lower commodity prices. Elevated household leverage and house
prices, while a risk per se, could amplify the growth impact of adverse external shocks. The
energy sector could be a source of both downside and upside risks, largely depending on

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director,
as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in the summing up can be found here:

further strength in Canada’s housing market pose upside risks to our forecast, although the latter
would imply more risks down the road.
Fiscal consolidation continued, with the general government overall deficit expected to improve
by about ¼ percentage points of GDP in 2013 to 3.1 percent of GDP. The federal government
fiscal deficit declined at a faster-than-expected pace on the back of stronger spending restraint,
and is expected to reach its balanced budget target in 2015. In contrast, a number of provinces
delayed the return to a balanced budget, and the aggregate fiscal stance at the provincial level
remained broadly unchanged in 2013.
As the output gap widened and inflation remained subdued, the Bank of Canada kept its policy
rate at 1 percent, the same level since September 2010, and gave more emphasis to the risks
associated with low inflation. Reacting to the perceived shift in Bank of Canada’s policy stance,
markets postponed the expected timing of the first increase in the policy rate.
Canada’s banking sector remains well capitalized and has low levels of nonperforming loans.
Stress tests suggest that major financial institutions (banks and insurance companies) would
continue to be resilient to a severe stress scenario, although risks remain from the continuation of
a low interest rate environment. The regulatory and supervisory framework is strong, and is
complemented by a credible federal system of safety nets, although there is no single body with
an explicit mandate to take a comprehensive view of systemic risks or to undertake crisis
preparedness. Improving cooperation between federal and provincial authorities would further
reinforce system wide oversight arrangements. Steps have been taken towards a more
coordinated regulation of securities markets, and the progress on the international financial
reform agenda continued.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for their continued sound macroeconomic and
financial sector management. Directors noted that, after a subdued performance in 2012, the
Canadian economy strengthened in 2013, but the expected rebalancing from household
consumption and residential construction towards exports and business investment has not
materialized.
Directors welcomed the improved short-term growth outlook, but noted that the balance of risks
remains tilted to the downside and important vulnerabilities, including elevated household
leverage, remain. Directors agreed that policies should continue to sustain economic activity
until the transition to more balanced growth gains firmer momentum, while assuring the
continued gradual unwinding of domestic imbalances. Directors considered that raising
productivity growth and broadening market access to Canada’s energy resources are key to boost
growth potential.
Directors viewed the current accommodative monetary policy stance as appropriate in light of
low inflation, well-anchored inflation expectations, the negative output gap, and looming
downside risks. The existence of domestic imbalances, however, reduces the room for lowering
the policy rate despite the recent moderation in the housing sector and household borrowing. In

3
case of a renewed acceleration in housing imbalances, Directors saw additional macro-prudential
measures as the first line of defense.
Directors stressed that fiscal policy should strike the right balance between supporting growth
and rebuilding fiscal buffers. If significant downside risks to growth materialize, the federal
government has room to slow its planned return to a balanced budget. Provinces with a weak
fiscal position might need to consider additional measures to ensure their deficit reduction
timetable is met.
Directors underscored the importance of addressing long-term fiscal sustainability challenges at
the general government level. They welcomed recent steps taken at the provincial level to limit
health care spending growth and stressed the need to maintain those savings into the future,
including through efficiency gains. Directors agreed that publishing long-term fiscal
sustainability analysis at both provincial and general government levels would help raise the
public awareness of the challenges ahead and build consensus around the needed policies.
Directors concurred that there is scope for re-examining the role of government-backed mortgage
insurance over the long term. While acknowledging the advantages of the current system,
Directors welcomed the authorities’ recent initiatives to impose limits on government-backed
mortgage insurance and noted that further measures should be considered to encourage
appropriate risk retention by the private sector and a more efficient allocation of resources.
Directors commended Canada’s strong financial regulatory and supervisory framework. They
supported recent steps towards a more coordinated regulation of provincial securities markets
and continued progress on the international financial reform agenda. They also welcomed the
strong results from the stress tests conducted for major Canadian financial institutions in the
context of the 2013 update of the Financial Sector Assessment Program. Directors agreed that
further strengthening Canada’s financial system would require improving its macro-prudential
oversight and system-wide crisis preparedness, fostering more cooperation between federal and
provincial authorities, and strengthening prudential responsibilities of the federal financial sector
regulator.
