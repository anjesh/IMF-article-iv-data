Executive Summary
Economic performance during 2005/06 was strong. Real GDP growth remained buoyant
and inflation declined slightly. Domestic demand and non-oil import growth, however,
remained high and the current account deficit increased to nearly 4 percent of GDP.
Record-high inflows of foreign direct investment (FDI), including from privatization, and
government borrowing from international markets at favorable terms more than covered the
larger deficit, resulting in a balance of payments surplus of over US$1 billion.
Pakistan’s main near-term challenge is to strengthen the balance of payments, in
particular the external current account. Given the favorable prospects for
non-debt-creating capital flows, meeting the above challenge requires placing the external
current account deficit relative to GDP on a declining path, and increasing international
reserves. A further tightening of monetary policy in 2006/07 that quickly aligns domestic
demand growth with output growth is necessary to attain this outcome. To be effective, the
monetary tightening should be supported by greater exchange rate flexibility and some fiscal
restraint. The authorities are of the view, however, that the external current account deficit
can be stabilized without major changes in the current stance of macroeconomic policies;
they believe that the unwinding of transitory, nonrecurrent factors that influenced last year’s
level of imports (e.g., oil price spike, foodstuff shortages) would lead to a significant
deceleration in import growth in the coming months.
Beyond 2006/07, the favorable prospects for sizable FDI flows bode well for future
gains in productivity and investment, but also present challenges for macroeconomic
policy. Continued reliance on FDI flows of uncertain size and timing to finance relatively
large deficits in the external current account would require a high degree of flexibility in
economic policymaking. An improved capacity to generate timely policy responses to
shortfalls of external financing arising from negative balance of payments shocks would help
safeguard macroeconomic stability during that period. Given the goal of strengthening the
official international reserves position, the option of resorting to the use of international
reserves to cover shortfalls of external financing should be used sparingly.
Sustaining high growth and poverty reduction through higher rates of saving and
investment remains Pakistan’s main medium-term challenge. Structural reforms
conducive to these goals (including ongoing efforts to improve the investment climate,
financial market reform, tax reform, improvements in public service delivery, and trade
liberalization) should be prioritized.

5
I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Pakistan’s economic performance since 2001/02 has been impressive. Growth has
accelerated, improvements in public spending and wide-ranging structural reforms have
reduced the debt burden and increased efficiency, and pro-poor policies have helped lower
poverty rates (Box 1). To maintain this momentum it is necessary to focus macroeconomic
policies on containing domestic demand growth and reducing the possible associated
vulnerabilities. Over the medium term, the challenge remains to deepen structural reforms in
areas critical for raising saving and investment, improving external competitiveness and
sustaining high output growth.
2.
The devastating earthquake of October 8, 2005 gave rise to additional demands
for government spending. The earthquake left a heavy toll in terms of human lives and
physical and social infrastructure, though it had relatively minor effects on macroeconomic
indicators (other than government spending) owing to weak links between the affected areas
and the rest of the economy. The bulk of government spending on relief and reconstruction
during 2005/06 was financed by external grants and loans, but higher-than-budgeted fiscal
resources also were allocated to this end. Reconstruction-related spending is expected to
decline gradually over the next four years.
3.
The political and security situation remains relatively calm. There has been some
domestic unrest, however, especially near the border with Afghanistan and in the Baluchistan
province. Relations with India are progressing slowly, following the ratification of the
South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA) in early 2006. Parliamentary and presidential
elections are scheduled for October 2007.
4.
The implementation of recent Fund advice on macroeconomic policy and
structural reforms has been mixed. During 2005/06, large negative shocks, especially
the earthquake, limited the scope for fiscal maneuver, and the overheating pressures
that were identified during the last Article IV consultation continued. Declines in
inflation and, especially, domestic demand growth were relatively small, the external current
account deficit widened by more than envisaged in mid-2005, and the rupee appreciated in
real terms. The import coverage of reserves, however, remained stable. Against this
background, the 2006 Article IV discussions focused on the macroeconomic policies needed
to moderate demand pressures and contain the external current account deficit, appropriate
policy responses to adverse external shocks, and structural reforms to help sustain rapid
growth and reduce poverty.

Box 1. Poverty in Pakistan—New Estimates
Poverty declined during the last four years. Estimates based on the recent Household Integrated Economic
Survey (HIES) show that the share of Pakistan’s population living below the poverty line (poverty headcount
ratio) declined by over 10 percentage points from 2000/01 to 2004/05. The decline was more than twice the size
of the increase recorded in this indicator during 1996/97–2000/01. Despite this impressive outturn, nearly one
quarter of Pakistan’s population continues to live below the poverty line. Two other key measures of poverty
incidence (the poverty gap and severity of poverty) also showed improvement during the last four years. Unlike
the poverty headcount ratio, however, the improvement in these indicators was not sufficiently large to bring
them below their 1996/97 levels.

The decline in poverty coincided with a strong pick up in economic growth. This is in line with
cross-country studies that find evidence of a robust inverse relationship between growth and poverty. The large
decline in the poverty headcount following the pick up in growth may also be related to the high concentration

II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
5.
Economic developments during 2005/06 were broadly favorable, but the external
current account deficit widened. Real GDP growth remained buoyant at 6.6 percent, and
average inflation (12-month rate) declined from 9.3 percent to 7.9 percent. Domestic demand
and import growth remained high, and the current account deficit increased to US$5 billion
(3.9 percent of GDP), from US$1.5 billion (1.4 percent of GDP) a year earlier. Record-high
net capital inflows (including from FDI and privatization) more than covered the larger
deficit and allowed an increase of nearly US$1 billion in gross official reserves. As of
end-June 2006, gross international reserves stood at US$10.8 billion (3.6 months of next
year’s imports of goods and services), and the interbank market exchange rate was broadly
unchanged from end-June 2005.

The fiscal deficit exceeded the original budget target for 2005/06 owing to
earthquake-related spending. Excluding the latter (0.9 percent of GDP), revenues and
expenditures both rose slightly (by roughly the same amounts) compared to the outturn in
2004/05. Strong corporate profits, higher petroleum taxes, and continued improvements in
tax administration more than offset lower nontax revenue. The increase in total expenditure
was mainly driven by development spending. The government debt-to-GDP ratio fell to
56 percent by end-June 2006, below the 60 percent ceiling stipulated in the 2005 Fiscal
Responsibility Law.1 The budget for 2006/07, approved in early June, targets a deficit of
4.2 percent of GDP (excluding grants), unchanged from the estimated outturn for 2005/06.
The underlying fiscal deficit (defined as the overall deficit excluding grants and
earthquake-related spending) is budgeted to increase by about 0.3 percent of GDP.

Domestic credit was, for the third year in a row, the main source of monetary
expansion. The growth of broad money and bank credit to the private sector decelerated, but
private sector credit still grew at the relatively high rate of 23 percent (Box 2). Bank lending
rates became increasingly positive in real terms as inflation declined, but the real return on
bank deposits remained negative. SBP claims on the government increased by more than
total government borrowing from banks (as commercial banks continued reducing their
holdings of government paper), and was the main factor behind the 10.2 percent increase in
reserve money. Interest rates on 6-month treasury bills remained stable at 8.2 percent
throughout 2005/06, and the discount rate was kept at its May 2005 level (9 percent) until
end-June.

Among other requirements, the law stipulates that the government debt-to-GDP ratio should: (a) fall below
60 percent by 2012/13, (b) remain below 60 percent thereafter; and (c) decline by at least 2½ percentage points
of GDP every year. According to the authorities, requirement (c) ceases to be binding once requirement (a) has
been met. Upward revisions to the nominal GDP series made in 2006 did not have a large influence on the
recorded decline in the debt-to-GDP ratio.

Box 2. Banking System Update
Pakistan’s banking system continued to strengthen since the last Article IV consultation. From
December 2004 to June 2006 most financial soundness indicators (FSI) improved. The rise in earning and

1/ Banking profitability is defined as the percentage
return on assets after tax.

Banks’ FSIs have improved, though this could be
partly due to continued rapid credit growth. The
expansion in bank credit to the private sector slowed to
23 percent in 2005/06 (from an average of 31 percent
in the previous two years) but remained on the high
side. The slowdown in credit during 2005/06 was
broad-based, affecting all types of borrowers—
including households. The growing deposit base
remained the primary source for credit expansion;
banks’ foreign borrowing, other than for trade credit,
remained negligible.
Concentration of the banking system remains high.
As of March 2006, Pakistan’s five largest banks held
53 percent of the system’s assets and 51 percent of its
loans—somewhat less than at end-2004. Public banks
still account for about 20 percent of total assets of the
banking system (excluding the SBP). Mergers and
acquisitions are on the rise, partly as a result of
mandated increases in minimum required capital (from
PRs 1.5 billion at end-2004, to PRs 3 billion at
end-2006, and further to PRs 6 billion in 2009). Foreign
banks’ interest in Pakistani banks is also on the rise,
partly in response to the government’s plans to divest
most of its shares in several domestic banks.

Monetary policy was tightened in July 2006; reserve requirements on bank deposits were
raised for the first time since end-2000 and, two weeks later, the discount rate was increased
to 9.5 percent.2

Foreign investors’ interest in Pakistan increased significantly in 2005/06. The
sale of the Karachi Electric Supply Company (KESC) and the partial sale and transfer of
management control of Pakistan Telecommunication Company Limited (PTCL) generated
large foreign exchange inflows and revitalized the privatization process.3 Foreign direct
investment inflows, excluding privatization, rose by 70 percent. The successful March 2006

In mid-June, the Supreme Court annulled the March 2006 sale of Pakistan Steel Mills (for US$362 million) to
a group of foreign investors due to procedural irregularities.

11
placement of US$800 million of 10-year and 30-year government bonds at very favorable
terms was also indicative of strong foreign demand for Pakistani paper.

Progress on structural reforms was mixed. Reforms to broaden the income tax
base and reduce rates continued, and the legal framework for investor protection was
strengthened. However, reform of the power sector has stalled, and the schedule of higher
regional electricity tariffs has not yet been implemented. Progress on trade liberalization
slowed.
III. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
10.
Discussions on the near-term macroeconomic outlook focused on steps to
strengthen the balance of payments and lower inflation, and on policy responses to
possible adverse external shocks. On structural reforms, discussions focused on key areas
to sustain high growth and reduce poverty over the medium term.
A. Economic Outlook and Key Challenges
11.
The outlook for sustained growth is favorable, provided inflation falls further.
In addition, there is a need to strengthen the balance of payments to reduce external
vulnerabilities by:
a. containing the external current account deficit;
b. obtaining foreign financing consistent with external debt sustainability; and
c. achieving a higher stock of international reserves.
Discussions on these issues were illustrated by quantitative scenarios. The focus was mainly
on: (i) the level and trajectory of the external current account deficit; (ii) the prospects for
external financing (particularly for non-debt-creating capital flows); and (iii) the role of
macroeconomic policies in reducing external risks.
12.
The authorities and staff had broadly similar views on the medium-term path
for the external current account deficit, the prospects for external financing, and the
targets for international reserves. The external current account deficit has reached
relatively high levels—by both historical and cross-country standards—and a further
widening could, at some point, compromise external sustainability. However, Pakistan’s
increased attractiveness to foreign investors (including from oil-exporting countries in the
Gulf region) has led to a notable rise in the supply of non-debt-creating capital flows (in
search of both profitable new projects and purchase of entities slated for privatization). At
the same time, the country’s ability to borrow from international and regional capital markets
at relatively low spreads and long maturities has also improved. With this change in the
supply of capital flows, external financing prospects can remain favorable for several years.
During this period, Pakistan could sustain external current account deficits in the range of
US$5-6 billion (consistent with a steady decline in the current account deficit-to-GDP ratio),
and strengthen gradually its international reserves position (chart).

13.
There were, however, differences of views on the policies needed to achieve those
outcomes. In the authorities’ view, the macroeconomic policy stance envisaged for
2006/07 will keep the external current account deficit at levels broadly similar to last
year’s outturn, and reduce headline CPI inflation to about 6½ percent. The current
policy stance was also seen by the authorities as consistent with the government’s target of
real GDP growth of at least 7 percent in 2006/07. The authorities expected import growth to
decelerate sharply during the year as the effects of transitory, nonrecurrent factors that
pushed up imports in 2005/06 (e.g., oil price spike, unforeseen imports of sugar) unwind.
They were also confident that the July 2006 tightening of monetary conditions, supported by
continued exchange rate stability, would accelerate the pace of disinflation. The authorities
thought that the recent tightening of monetary policy would not have adverse effects on bank
lending to the private sector.4 Moreover, they indicated that they were prepared to tighten
monetary policy further if inflation continued above the government’s 6½ percent target. On
the fiscal side, the authorities saw some scope for overperforming on their budget deficit
target for 2006/07, including by saving higher-than-projected revenue.
14.
The authorities’ policy stance for 2006/07 may not suffice, however, to contain
domestic demand growth and stabilize the external current account deficit. In particular,
a further tightening of monetary policy, including by allowing higher cutoff rates at treasury
bill auctions (to increase commercial banks’ demand for government paper and reduce SBP’s
direct lending to the government), would help slow the growth of private sector credit and
non-oil imports, and avoid an increase in the external current account deficit-to-GDP ratio.
To be effective, this tightening would have to be supported by greater exchange rate
4

At the time of the discussions the SBP had not finalized revising its monetary projections for 2006/07.
However, staff was informed that the revised projections would include an increase in bank lending to the
private sector of about 18 percent (year-on-year) during 2006/07.

13
flexibility and by fiscal restraint to keep the underlying budget deficit (the overall deficit
excluding grants and earthquake-related expenditures) at the level of 2005/06—i.e., some
0.3 percent of GDP lower than the outcome envisaged in the budget.
15.
During the discussions, staff prepared a macroeconomic scenario encompassing
monetary and fiscal tightening (Tables 2–6). In the staff’s scenario, higher real interest
rates starting in 2006/07 are assumed to rein in domestic demand growth, significantly
reduce non-oil imports growth, and lower inflation to 6½ percent. Over the medium term,
fiscal consolidation bringing the overall fiscal deficit (excluding grants) below 2½ percent of
GDP, a stable real exchange rate, and the maintenance of real interest rates at positive levels
would help keep domestic demand growth in check and narrow the aggregate savinginvestment imbalance. Under these policy assumptions, output growth would remain in the
6½–7 percent range (compared to growth in the 7–8 percent range expected by the
government), headline and core inflation would fall further to 5 percent, and the reserve
import coverage would rise moderately. The downward trend in public debt and external debt
ratios would continue, even under less favorable assumptions for growth and interest rates
(Tables 7–8, Figures 1–2). By 2010/11, the external current account deficit as a share of GDP
(2.3 percent) would be close to Pakistan’s current account “norm” (Box 3).
16.
The authorities were in broad agreement with the inflation and international
reserves objectives contained in the staff’s scenario, as well as with the balance of
payments outlook, but took the view that achieving those objectives did not require
major changes in the policies currently in place. They also believe that growth would be
somewhat higher than assumed by staff. The authorities anticipate that higher growth
would result from rapid increases in investment as a result of the large inflows of foreign
direct investment, continued support from credit policy, and higher capital expenditure—
especially in infrastructure. In addition, they envisage that growth in national savings would
outpace the increase in domestic investment, driven by a gradual rise of real interest rates (as
a result of the lower inflation), a decline in the fiscal deficit below 3 percent of GDP over the
medium term, growth-induced increases in personal disposable income, and favorable
demographic trends.
17.
The authorities viewed the current level of the real exchange rate as broadly
appropriate. They indicated that the real exchange rate was significantly more depreciated
than its level during the 1990s, and that export growth had not been affected by the recent,
small, real appreciation. Staff noted that while domestic demand pressures, rather than losses
in external competitiveness, had been a major factor behind the increase in the trade and
current account deficits since 2003/04, future policies should be consistent with avoiding a
steady appreciation of the real exchange rate over the medium term. The authorities
recognized that a continued strengthening of the rupee would be inconsistent with the
required decline in the current account deficit-to-GDP ratio.

14
Box 3. Pakistan’s Real Exchange Rate
Relative to its trading partners, the
(CPI-based) real value of the rupee rose
by almost 10 percent from December
2004 to June 2006, a period when strong
domestic demand put pressure on prices
and the external current account, and the
external terms-of-trade deteriorated. As of
mid-2006, Pakistan’s real effective
exchange rate (REER) was at about the
same level as in early 2002, but well
below its average during the 1990s.

Estimates based on two methodologies

to evaluate misalignment suggest that
1/
the rupee may be slightly overvalued as of mid-2006. Estimates from the equilibrium real exchange rate
approach suggest that the rupee is 10 percent more appreciated than the (equilibrium) level that results from
applying to Pakistani data the coefficients obtained from a cross-country panel regression of “fundamental” REER
determinants. Estimates from the external sustainability approach also suggest the need for a real depreciation of a
broadly similar magnitude in order for the current account deficit to decline to the level that stabilizes Pakistan’s net
foreign assets-to-GDP ratio at its 2004 level.

In contrast, estimates from a third methodology, the macroeconomic balance approach (MBA), do not point to
an overvaluation of the rupee. According to this methodology, the macroeconomic policies in the staff’s scenario
(see paragraph 15) would be consistent with a five-year ahead current account deficit-to-GDP ratio (2.3 percent) that
is broadly in line with the equilibrium current account (“current account norm”) implied by the medium-term levels
of the “fundamentals” that determine Pakistan’s saving and investment. If the five year-ahead current account
deficit-to-GDP ratio were higher than in the projections in Table 3, however, the MBA would also find evidence of
overvaluation.

B. Risks to the Outlook and Policy Responses
18.
The favorable outlook for capital flows and the balance of payments is subject to
downside risks. Even if the external current account-to-GDP ratio is placed on a downward
trajectory, macroeconomic stability throughout the projection period will be dependent on
the timely receipt of large flows of foreign direct investment (FDI). FDI flows typically
consist of a few “lumpy” transactions that are subject to delays of uncertain duration, and are
intrinsically difficult to predict. It is thus possible that in some periods (which may last
weeks, or even months) the external financing available to Pakistan could fall short of the

15
amounts assumed in the scenario.5 If policies remain unchanged, official international
reserves during those periods would fall below the (rising) path shown in Tables 2–3. Shocks
to the current account are also possible. Higher oil prices or lower private transfers could
cause deviations from the path for the external current account deficit shown in Tables 2–3,
which would also call for a policy response.6
19.
The authorities indicated that their response to adverse balance of payments
developments would take into account the nature and severity of the shock. They
believed that temporary shocks involving external financing shortfalls could be
accommodated by using international reserves or increasing foreign borrowing. In cases
where the shortfalls were sizable, or more permanent, however, the authorities noted that
their response would take into consideration the full range of policy instruments.
20.
Using international reserves to cover external financing shortfalls stemming
from balance of payments shocks would carry some risks. This would especially be the
case for shortfalls caused by the postponement of new FDI projects (or large-scale
privatizations). The time required to recover the reserves used to finance shortfalls caused by
this type of shock is uncertain, and often beyond the authorities’ control. Until the flows
from that particular FDI transaction materialize, the balance of payments position would be
weaker, and external vulnerabilities higher than in the baseline scenario. Continued reliance
on this policy response may result in significantly lower levels of reserves which, if sustained
for a prolonged period, could reduce Pakistan’s attractiveness for foreign investors, and
jeopardize external sustainability.
21.
Monetary policy should respond quickly to shortfalls of external financing.
Because foreign borrowing may not be readily available to cover all external financing
shortfalls,7 the task of preventing significant losses of international reserves following shocks
to the current or financial account has to fall primarily on monetary policy. In cases where
external shocks are very large, fiscal measures conducive to higher fiscal savings also should
be part of the policy response. In this regard, discussions centered on the authorities’
preparedness to tighten monetary policy in a timely manner in response to balance of
payments shocks. To this effect, staff recommended to pay close attention to the level of
5

Net flows of FDI (including privatization receipts) average US$5.2 billion per annum in the baseline “policy”
scenario of Tables 2–6. This implies that delays in finalizing one large transaction (either a new project or a
privatization) representing, for example, 20–25 percent of the inflows expected for any given year would create
an ex-ante shortfall of financing, relative to the baseline projections, of over US$1 billion.

Figure 2 (second row, second column) illustrates the effect of a negative shock to the non-interest current
account balance on the external-debt-to-GDP ratio. In this exercise, the new foreign borrowing (which is
assumed to be fully available in the same year of the shock) represents the “policy response” to the higher
current account deficit.

market participants tolerance for greater flexibility in the nominal exchange rate.
C. Key Structural Reforms
22.
Structural reforms will be essential for sustaining high growth and poverty
reduction through higher rates of saving and investment. Discussions focused on four
areas critical to attain this goal.
23.
Deepening domestic financial markets. Efficient financial intermediation is a key
element in the strategy to maintain Pakistan on a high-growth trajectory. The authorities
pointed to the ongoing modernization of the National Savings Schemes (NSS), recent
initiatives to foster microfinance, and the phased reform of the system of broker-financing of
stock trading (“Badla”) as evidence of their continued efforts to develop domestic financial
markets. Discussions centered on the need to subject the NSS to market discipline so as to
integrate it more fully with local financial markets, and on the advisability of moving
speedily with plans to replace Badla with the regular margin financing used in modern stock
exchanges. The staff stressed that new issues of long-term government securities—e.g.,
Pakistani Investment Bonds (PIBs)—were essential for the development of a local bond
market, and encouraged the authorities to substantially increase reliance on this means of
deficit financing during 2006/07.8 Although banking system soundness indicators have
continued to improve, and recent stress tests by the SBP do not reveal vulnerabilities, the
authorities agreed with staff that it was prudent to remain vigilant of banking system
developments in light of the rapid credit expansion of the last three years.
24.
Increasing government revenues. The authorities concur that raising the tax
revenue-to-GDP ratio will be necessary to realize their fiscal strategy and create space for
pro-poor spending. Key measures to broaden the tax base (such as expanding taxation of the
agricultural and service sectors and eliminating nonstandard exemptions) could have large
revenue potential, but the authorities indicated that there was not enough political support for
undertaking them at present. Efforts to increase the efficiency of tax collection by
streamlining of income tax rates, however, have continued. On tax administration, there has
been recent progress on rolling out large- and medium-taxpayer offices, and discussions
covered reform priorities going forward—including improvement of audit strategies, and
advancing the functional integration of income and sales tax administration.

8

In May 2006, the authorities raised PRs 10 billion through the placement of 10-year PIBs that carried an
average yield of 9.8 percent. This was the first placement of PIBs since May 2004 and represented less than
15 percent of net domestic government borrowing in 2005/06. On September 30, the authorities re-allowed
nonbank institutional investors to access the NSS. The scope for large issuances of PIBs in 2006/07 is likely to
be substantially smaller as a result of this decision.

17
25.
Improving public service delivery. Steps are being taken to improve the efficiency
and composition of government spending and strengthen public financial management,
including through technical assistance from FAD. Work conducive to the doubling of
spending on education and health as a share of GDP within 10 years (as mandated by the
2005 Fiscal Responsibility Law) is underway, including through the rolling out of
medium-term budget frameworks in several key ministries and the preparation of a new
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper. Discussions highlighted the importance of reallocating
spending from untargeted subsidies to pro-poor and pro-growth spending in order to reduce
inefficiencies and facilitate faster progress towards the attainment of the Millennium
Development Goals.
26.
Trade liberalization. Pakistan remains committed to a liberal trade regime, but the
authorities indicated that progress in trade liberalization has been affected by the
inconclusive Doha round. Pakistan’s textile exports performed reasonably well following the
January 2005 expiration of the Multi-Fiber Agreement (Box 4). The authorities noted,
however, that they had since felt compelled to adopt schemes to support Pakistani exporters
in order to offset the increased subsidies provided by other textile-exporting countries. They
also argued that Pakistan’s increased efforts to sign preferential trade agreements with
several countries was part of a global trend. Staff stressed the advantages of persevering with
trade liberalization despite difficulties in the global trading environment.
D. Other Issues
27.
Statistics. Pakistan’s data are broadly adequate for effective surveillance, but further
improvements in the availability and timeliness of key economic statistics would help policy
analysis and formulation (Appendix III). On fiscal data, the authorities plan to make interim
arrangements (pending full implementation of system upgrades under a World Banksupported project) for economic classification reporting, and to work on avoiding the
recurrence of the large statistical discrepancies between above- and below-the-line fiscal
outturns of the last two years. Staff encouraged the authorities to expedite the process of
subscribing to the Special Data Dissemination Standard, including by compiling quarterly
national accounts and wage data and appointing a national coordinator.
28.
AML/CFT framework. Pakistan continues to strengthen its anti-money laundering/
combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) framework. In July 2006, the SBP issued
prudential regulations recommended by the Financial Action Task Force. In addition, a bill
creating a national executive committee on AML is under parliamentary consideration.

18
Box 4. Textile and Clothing Exports Following the Expiration
of the Multi-Fiber Agreement (MFA)
Textile and Clothing (T&C) is Pakistan’s main export industry. Its share in total exports has been around
60 percent for the last 10 years, up from 50 percent in the early 1990s. Only Bangladesh and Cambodia have a
larger share of T&C in total exports.
Pakistan performed relatively well in the wake of the removal (in January 2005) of the quotas restricting
T&C exports to developed countries under the MFA. T&C export growth started to rise in 2002 (up to a
sample-peak of 23 percent in mid-2003) reflecting both expanding production capacity and an improving trade
regime. T&C export growth fell below 10 percent in the first quarter of 2005, but ratcheted up to nearly
20 percent by the end of the year.
The scope for sustained market share gains in a post-MFA environment has become more uncertain.
Pakistan’s T&C export base is relatively concentrated in low value-added products: yarn and bedwear/towels
account for 45 percent of T&C exports, while exports of ready-made garments account for only 15 percent.
Increases in input costs (i.e., minimum wages, interest rates and energy) during 2005/06 may have reduced
Pakistan’s T&C competitiveness. Pakistani exporters argue that their foreign competitors benefit from export
subsidies and protection from similar cost increases. To allay these concerns, the government has recently granted
T&C exporters a research and development subsidy of 5 percent as well as loan-refinancing schemes at below
market terms.
Prospects for strong growth in Pakistan’s T&C exports remain favorable if productivity gains are
sustained and the value-added content of export increases. Pakistan’s textile industry has up-to-date
technology, and easy access to homegrown premium-quality cotton. Policies should help enhance the industry’s
responsiveness to market signals through improvements in the overall business climate, increases in the efficiency
of the production process and enhancements in product quality. Across-the-board export subsidy schemes run
counter to this objective, as they tend to delay the allocation of resources toward the most competitive sub-sectors
in the T&C industry.

IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
29.
Economic performance during 2005/06 was strong. The economy withstood well
the impact of large negative shocks, including the tragic earthquake of October 2005, a large
rise in international oil prices, and unfavorable weather conditions. Growth remained
buoyant, inflation started to decline, and debt ratios fell further.
30.
Pakistan continued to attract large inflows of foreign investment. The surplus in
the financial account of the balance of payments in 2005/06 reached a historical peak,
reflecting a marked rise in FDI flows—destined to both new projects and entities slated for
privatization. Strong foreign demand for Pakistani assets (including from oil-exporting
countries in the Gulf region) was also reflected in the favorable terms for new bond
placements in international capital markets. Global and regional conditions, together with
Pakistan’s strong record on the macroeconomic and structural reform fronts in recent years,
bodes well for continued sizable FDI flows.
31.
Domestic demand pressures, however, have not subsided. The trade and current
account deficits have increased, driven by rapid import growth, and the pace of disinflation
remains slow. Credit growth continued at a strong pace in 2005/06, the fiscal deficit
(excluding earthquake-related expenditures) increased slightly, and policy interest rates and
the exchange rate remained stable. Monetary conditions were tightened somewhat in
July 2006, but the authorities do not envisage that further changes in the stance of
macroeconomic policies will be necessary in the remainder of 2006/07.
32.
Macroeconomic policies in 2006/07 should be more effectively geared at slowing
domestic demand growth in order to contain the external current account deficit and
accelerate the pace of disinflation. A further tightening of monetary policy resulting in
higher cutoff rates at treasury bill auctions and significantly lower central bank lending to the
government would help reduce credit and import growth, stabilize the external current
account deficit, and attain the government’s 6½ percent inflation target. To be effective, the
monetary tightening should be supported by greater exchange rate flexibility and fiscal
restraint to keep the underlying budget deficit (the overall deficit excluding grants and
earthquake-related expenditures) at the level of 2005/06.
33.
Beyond 2006/07, macroeconomic policies should ensure that the current account
deficit-to-GDP ratio remains on a declining path. Fiscal consolidation that brings the
overall fiscal deficit (excluding grants) to about 2½ percent of GDP over the medium term, a
tight monetary policy stance that keeps real interest rates at positive levels (and credit growth
more closely aligned with nominal GDP growth), and the continuation of a policy allowing
for greater exchange rate flexibility are necessary to keep domestic demand growth in check,
avoid a sustained real appreciation of the currency and gradually bring the external current
account deficit to a more sustainable level—in the range of 2–2½ percent of GDP.

20
34.
The favorable prospects for foreign direct investment bode well for future gains
in productivity, but large non-debt-creating capital inflows also present challenges for
macroeconomic policy. Continued reliance on inflows of foreign direct investment of
uncertain size and timing to finance large current account deficits would require a high
degree of flexibility in economic policymaking. In this regard, an improved capacity to
generate timely policy responses to shortfalls of external financing arising from negative
balance of payments shocks would help safeguard macroeconomic stability in the years
ahead. When designing those policy responses, staff recommends that priority be given to a
significant strengthening of the international reserves position. The option of resorting to
official international reserves to cover shortfalls of external financing carries risks, and
should be used sparingly.
35.
Structural reforms conducive to sustained increases in saving and investment
need to be prioritized. Completing the reform of the regulatory and tariff framework for the
power sector will improve productivity, increase public sector savings, and enhance the
prospects for privatization of power companies. Creating space for increases in public
investment and pro-poor spending, and for faster fiscal consolidation, requires stepped-up
efforts to garner the political support required for broadening the tax base and further
curtailing nonstandard exemptions. Improvements in the debt management strategy to shift
the sources of fiscal deficit financing away from short-term treasury bills and NSS funds into
long-term government securities (PIBs) are essential to jump-start the local bond market.
Initiatives underway to modernize the NSS and reform the system of broker-financing of
stock trading are welcome, but should be followed quickly with measures that enable the
integration of the NSS with local financial markets and with the adoption of the regular
margin financing used in modern stock exchanges. Ongoing efforts to improve the
investment climate are also important for sustaining rapid growth and reducing poverty.
36.
Staff welcomes Pakistan’s commitment to maintaining a liberal trade regime,
and its determination to contribute to the success of the Doha round of trade talks.
To further raise the economy’s outward-orientation, staff advises the authorities to resist
pressures to reinstate ad-hoc tariff and nontariff measures, and to adopt special support
schemes for some exports. It is also important to evaluate carefully the administrative costs
and trade diversion effects of the preferential trade agreements currently under consideration.
37.
Pakistan maintains an exchange restriction on payments for current
international transactions that should be lifted. Under this restriction, advance payments
for certain imports are limited to 50 percent. Staff is not proposing approval given the lack of
a timetable for lifting this restriction.
38.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation take place within the standard
12 month cycle.

1/ General government gross debt; excludes external military debt, external commercial debt, and external short-term debt.
2/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + αε (1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; α = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and ε = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as αε (1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term domestic debt at end of previous period.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

A. Nonfinancial Relations
VII.

Exchange System

Prior to mid-1998, Pakistan’s exchange rate system consisted of a fixed exchange rate with
periodic step devaluations to compensate for the inflation differential with major trading
partners. On July 21, 1998, a dual exchange system was introduced consisting of a fixed
official exchange rate at PRs 46 per $1 and a floating interbank market exchange rate
(FIBR). Under this system, all authorized transactions were effectively conducted at the socalled “composite rate” which was the weighted average of the FIBR and the official
exchange rate. On May 19, 1999, the official exchange rate was eliminated and the exchange
rate system unified, with all international transactions conducted at the FIBR. In their formal
notification, the authorities classify Pakistan’s exchange rate regime as managed floating
with no predetermined path for the exchange rate. The nominal exchange rate has remained
in the range of 59.0 to 60.5 rupees per U.S. dollar since late December 2004. As a result,
Pakistan is classified as having a de facto conventional peg to the U.S. dollar. As of
September 29, 2006, the FIBR was PRs 60.48 per $1. Pakistan has accepted the obligations
of Article VIII, but maintains an exchange restriction on payments for current international
transactions subject to Fund approval under Article VIII, Section 2a, resulting from
limitations on advance payments for certain imports.

Last Article IV Consultation

The last Article IV consultation and ex post assessment of longer-term program engagement
staff reports (IMF Country Report No. 05/409) were discussed by the Executive Board on
November 2, 2005.

Safeguards Assessments

In accordance with the Fund’s safeguards assessment policy, the State Bank of Pakistan
(SBP) was subject to a full safeguards assessment under the Stand-By Arrangement that
expired on September 30, 2001. This assessment, which included a safeguards mission to the
SBP, was completed on February 13, 2001. The staff’s findings and recommendations were
reported in IMF Country Report No. 01/58, Appendix IV. The authorities have implemented
all of the recommended remedial measures that were included under SBA conditionality, and
no new critical vulnerabilities were identified under Pakistan’s subsequent PRGF
Arrangement.

Recent Technical Assistance

a.
FAD: A mission in January–February 2000 assisted with the revision of fiscal data
and advised on measures to strengthen the fiscal reporting and accounting systems. In
August 2000, a joint FAD-STA mission reviewed progress in the strengthening of the fiscal
reporting and accounting systems and assisted authorities in the preparation of revised fiscal
data for 1993/94–1998/99. In September 2000, a mission provided technical assistance (TA)
on overhauling the income tax law. In January 2001, a mission provided advice on priorities
and strategies for improving the tax collection operations of the CBR. A follow-up mission
on income tax policy took place in May 2001. In August 2001, a mission assisted the
authorities in the preparation of tax administration reforms. In January 2002, another mission
advised the authorities on fiscal data management, quality, and transparency. In January
2003, a mission assisted the authorities in reviewing and preparing tax administration
reforms. In March 2003, a mission advised the authorities on customs administration reform.
In April 2004, a mission advised the authorities on improving fiscal reporting at the
subnational level.
b.
MFD: In July 2000, a joint MFD/MCD mission provided technical advice on issues
relating to the transformation to a financial system that is compliant with Islamic finance

APPENDIX II: PAKISTAN—RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
Thomas Buckley, Senior Country Officer, Telephone: (202) 473-0075

1.
Pakistan is among the largest recipients of World Bank financial assistance. In
FY2006 World Bank support to Pakistan totaled US$1.5 billion, making it the fourth largest
borrower in the world. The World Bank Group program in Pakistan consists of an integrated
package of financial support, including IBRD lending, concessional IDA credits and IFC
investments along with complementary analytical and advisory services.
2.
The Bank Group’s Board of Directors endorsed a new Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS) for Pakistan on June 1, 2006, covering fiscal years 2006 through 2009. The CAS
outlines the Bank’s strategic approach to helping Pakistan achieve its development goals
over the coming four years. Despite recent good economic performance, Pakistan’s
development challenges remain formidable. The strategy addresses the key challenge of
sustaining rapid growth in order to further reduce poverty. This will require accelerating
human development so that the poor can participate in and benefit from growth. Sustained
growth will also require sound macroeconomic management along with improvements in the
investment climate, including regulatory reform and significant investment in infrastructure.
3.

The CAS is designed around three main pillars:

•
Sustained Growth and Improved Competitiveness: The principal focus of this
pillar will be to support investments and reforms needed to improve the business
environment for trade and investment and sustain rapid, private sector-led growth. The Bank
will provide support to key sectors such as agriculture and infrastructure, and help the
government strengthen macroeconomic management through improving public expenditures
and supporting ongoing tax reforms.
•
Strengthened Governance and Service Delivery: Priorities in this area will be to
support further reforms and investment to increase efficiency, transparency, and
accountability in the use of public resources while supporting cross-cutting reforms needed
to improve service delivery at all levels of government—with particular attention to health,
education, water and sanitation, safety nets, and municipal services.
•
Improved Lives and Protection of the Vulnerable: The Bank will focus on
increased investment in the education and health sectors to help build the skilled, healthy
work force needed to sustain strong growth. This area of the CAS also features targeted
interventions to help the poor including strengthening safety nets and targeted interventions
and community-based approaches in rural areas.

40
4.
In line with Pakistan’s recent performance and the government’s request for
increased Bank Group support, the CAS outlines a substantial increase in the volume of
lending to Pakistan during the next four years. The expansion in lending will take place
primarily in infrastructure (mainly in energy, water, and transport) and human development.
An immediate priority will be to assist in addressing the impact of the October 2005
earthquake—up to US$1 billion will be used to support reconstruction and recovery. Overall,
a flexible lending program of up to US$6.5 billion is set forth in the CAS. About half of this
amount (US$3.1 billion) will take the form of IDA credits. Policy-based lending will account
for up to half of planned financial support.
5.
The IFC strategy in Pakistan, as expressed in the CAS, seeks to increase investments
with a target range of US$500–600 million during the FY2006–09 period. IFC activity will
focus on three main sectors: financial, SME and infrastructure. IFC has also initiated a
substantial TA program in Pakistan to build capacity and address constraints of the SME,
infrastructure and financial sectors.

APPENDIX III: PAKISTAN—STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
Data are broadly adequate for effective surveillance; however, the December 2004
data ROSC report identified shortcomings in some statistical practices that could detract from
accurate and timely analysis of economic and financial developments and the formulation of
appropriate policies.1 Follow-up STA technical assistance missions have assisted the
authorities in implementing some of the key recommendations made in the report to address
the shortcomings.
2.
The authorities are committed to adhering to internationally accepted standards and
good practices, as demonstrated by participation in the General Data Dissemination System
(GDDS) since 2003. Pakistan meets the recommendations for the coverage, periodicity, and
timeliness of most GDDS data categories. The only exceptions are the timeliness of the GDP
and the lack of annual data on wages/earnings. For subscription to the Special Data
Dissemination Standard (SDDS), Pakistan will need to disseminate (a) the monthly analytical

unemployment data with a timeliness of one quarter; (c) monthly transaction data on central
government operations with a timeliness of one month; (d) quarterly data on the national
accounts, wages/earnings, and external debt, all with a timeliness of one quarter; (e) more

In 2004, the Federal Bureau of Statistics (FBS) completed a revision of the national
accounts statistics to bring them in line with the concepts and definitions of the 1993 System
of National Accounts (1993 SNA). As noted by the December 2004 data ROSC, informal
economic activities need to be better captured, while newly emerging activities, such as in the
information technology sector, continue to pose challenges. An IMF mission visited Pakistan
in April–June 2005 to assist the FBS in the development of quarterly national accounts
(QNA) and to advise on the dwelling rent component of the consumer price index (CPI). The
compilation methods for the QNA are very similar to those for the annual accounts. However,
quarterly data sources are very limited and considerable use is made of forecasts and quarterly
allocations in line with production calendars. In the process of reviewing the sources and
methods used to compile the QNA, a number of deficiencies in the annual compilation
methods were discovered. With respect to labor market statistics, the FBS has recently started
to compile quarterly employment/unemployment data (although not with the frequency
required for subscription to the SDDS) and is investigating the feasibility of disseminating
data on wages/salaries.

The FBS produces three price indices: the CPI, the wholesale price index (WPI), and
the sensitive price indicator (SPI). The CPI and WPI are compiled on a monthly basis. The
SPI is compiled on a weekly basis and consists of 46 essential commodities that are consumed
by the lowest income group. The concepts and definitions of the CPI and WPI follow
international guidelines. Plans have been made to introduce the classification of individual
consumption by purpose (COICOP) and to complete the work to develop a Producer Price
Index (PPI), with base year 1999/2000; an IMF mission also provided some advice in this
regard.
5.
The concepts and definitions used in compiling GFS are broadly based on the
methodology prescribed in A Manual on Government Finance Statistics, 1986 (GFSM 1986),
except that the treatment of privatization proceeds resembles the methodology of the
Government Finance Statistics Manual, 2001 (GFSM 2001). The scope of central government
data is further limited because it does not cover the activity of extra-budgetary funds.
Classification and sectorization systems follow GFSM 1986 standards to a limited extent. The
classification of expenditure departs substantially from GFSM 1986 methodology, because
the economic and functional classifications are mixed in reporting, with defense and
government administration expenditures not clearly identified according to economic
classification. The basis of recording GFS is on, or close to, a cash basis. Transactions are
recorded on a gross basis. Corrective transactions are not necessarily made in the original
period, as required by GFSM 1986. Plans for improvement of GFS are taking place within the
context of the Project for the Improvement of Financial Reporting and Auditing (PIFRA). The
authorities have indicated their intent to adopt the methodology of Government Finance
Statistics Manual 2001 over the medium to long term. Budgetary central government
operations data are regularly reported for inclusion in the GFS Yearbook, and use the GFSM
2001 framework. However, no data are reported on transactions in nonfinancial and financial
assets and liabilities. The authorities do not report higher frequency data for inclusion in the
IFS.
6.
The ROSC mission found that the analytical framework for monetary statistics reflects
concepts and definitions that are based on the IMF’s Guide to Money and Banking Statistics
in International Finance Statistics of December 1984. The scope of the monetary statistics is
comprehensive. The classification and sectorization of the monetary survey compiled by
SBP’s Statistics Department for reporting to the IMF and for internal use are broadly in line
with the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM). The basis for recording flows
and stocks is largely consistent with MFSM and the SBP has indicated its intention to adopt
the MFSM in order to further improve monetary statistics. In particular, the SBP plans to
(a) disaggregate data on nonfinancial corporations and households within the private sector;
(b) collect data on nonbank financial institutions to expand the coverage of the monetary
aggregates; and (c) disseminate the analytical accounts of the SBP within two weeks after the
end of the reference month. A follow-up mission to prepare a substantive update to the
monetary statistics section of the ROSC report is scheduled for November 1–15, 2006. This
mission will also finalize the review of the data in the Standardized Report Form framework.

43
7.
The balance of payments statistics are compiled broadly in accordance with the
concepts and definitions of the Balance of Payments Manual, Fifth Edition (BPM5). The
presentation of the balance of payments in the publications and the website of the SBP is
based both on the BPM4 and BPM5. In general, the scope of the balance of payments
pertaining to residency conforms to BPM5. The exceptions include the enterprises operating
in the export processing zones and offshore banks, which are regarded as nonresidents, and
Pakistani nationals residing abroad but owning a dwelling in Pakistan, who are considered
residents. Classification and sectorization systems also follow BPM5 to some extent while the
basis for recording transactions follows best international practices. The 2004 ROSC
identified shortcomings in the treatment of oil exports under product sharing agreements and
the estimation of reinvested earnings. The report also noted the absence of revisions studies.
International investment position data are now compiled and published on the SBP website.
Regarding the external sector, the SBP plans to: (a) continue the implementation of the
BPM5; and (b) continue disseminating data on the SBP website following the format of the
template on International Reserves and Foreign Currency Liquidity. Finally, the differences
between the two sources of trade data (FBS and SBP) for imports have been widening. Most
of the differences can be reconciled ex-post (see SBP’s Second Quarterly Report for
FY2006), and the authorities are working to narrow these differences before the publication of
the data.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2006 Article IV Consultation with Pakistan
On November 22, 2006, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Pakistan.1
Background
Pakistan’s recent economic performance has been impressive. Growth has accelerated,
improvements in public spending and wide-ranging structural reforms have reduced the debt
burden and increased efficiency, and pro-poor policies have helped lower poverty rates. The
devastating earthquake of October 2005 left a heavy toll in terms of human lives and physical and
social infrastructure, but had relatively minor effects on macroeconomic indicators (except for an
increase in government spending) owing mainly to the small share of the affected areas in the
overall economy.
Economic developments during the fiscal year ending in June 2006 were favorable, with buoyant
real GDP growth and inflation declining to 7.6 percent. The external current account deficit,
however, increased to US$5 billion (3.9 percent of GDP), from US$1.5 billion (1.4 percent of GDP)
a year earlier. Record-high net capital flows (mainly from foreign direct investment—including
privatization) more than covered the larger deficit and allowed for a build up of nearly US$1 billion
in official international reserves. The interbank market exchange rate was broadly unchanged from
end-June 2005.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and
discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters,
the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the
conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views
of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities.

2

The fiscal deficit exceeded the original budget target for 2005/06 owing to earthquake-related
spending. Excluding the latter, revenues and expenditures rose by roughly the same amounts
compared to the outturn in the previous fiscal year. The government debt-to-GDP ratio fell to
56 percent by the end of June, below the 60 percent ceiling stipulated in the 2005 Fiscal
Responsibility Law. The budget for 2006/07 targets a deficit of 4.2 percent of GDP (excluding
grants), unchanged from the estimated outturn for 2005/06.
The growth of broad money and bank credit to the private sector decelerated in 2005/06, but
private sector credit continued to expand at a relatively strong pace. Bank lending rates became
increasingly positive in real terms as inflation declined; the real return on bank deposits remained
negative. The State Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP) claims on the government rose by more than total
government borrowing from the banking system, as the SBP absorbed treasury bills that
commercial banks did not roll over upon redemption. In July 2006, the SBP tightened monetary
conditions by raising reserve and liquidity requirements on bank deposits and the discount rate.
Foreign investors’ interest in Pakistan increased significantly in 2005/06. Foreign direct investment
inflows, excluding privatization, rose by 70 percent, and foreign demand for Pakistani bonds was
strong. Government divestiture from electricity and telecommunications entities generated large
foreign exchange inflows and revitalized the privatization process.
Progress on structural reforms, other than privatization, was mixed. Reforms to broaden the
income tax base and streamline rates continued, and the legal framework for investor protection
was strengthened. However, implementation of the schedule of higher regional electricity tariffs, a
key step for continued reform of the power sector, remains pending, and progress on trade
liberalization slowed.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended Pakistan’s impressive macroeconomic performance since 2001.
They welcomed in particular the acceleration in output growth, the steady decline in debt ratios,
and the fall in poverty rates. Directors noted that Pakistan’s strong track record on the
macroeconomic and structural reform fronts had made the country increasingly attractive to foreign
investors, as shown by the record-high inflows of foreign direct investment (FDI) during 2005/06
and the favorable terms obtained on recent sovereign bond placements in the international capital
markets.
Directors noted that during 2005/06 the Pakistani economy had withstood well the impact of large
negative shocks, including the tragic earthquake of October 2005, a sharp rise in international oil
prices, and unfavorable weather conditions. Although these shocks had limited the scope for fiscal
maneuver, growth had remained buoyant, inflation had declined slightly and the import coverage of
reserves had remained stable.

3

Directors nonetheless noted the risks to the outlook, including the continued strength of domestic
demand, and its adverse effects on the trade and current account deficits as well as on the pace of
disinflation during 2005/06. They noted also the authorities’ view that macroeconomic imbalances
would decline without the need for further changes in the stance of policies envisaged for the
current fiscal year, and welcomed the government’s commitment to tighten monetary policy, if
warranted. However, most Directors felt that macroeconomic policies during 2006/07 should be
more effectively geared at reducing domestic demand and strengthening the balance of payments
position. To this effect, many considered that a further tightening of monetary policy (including by
allowing higher cutoff rates at treasury bill auctions) should not be delayed to help strengthen the
external position and allow the government to meet its inflation target. Most Directors considered
that to be effective, monetary policy should be supported by exchange rate flexibility and a fiscal
policy that keeps this year’s budget deficit (excluding grants and earthquake-related expenditures)
at least at the level of 2005/06.
Directors stressed that, beyond 2006/07, Pakistan’s macroeconomic policies should aim at
ensuring that the external current account deficit-to-GDP ratio remains on a declining path with a
steady build up of reserves. In this regard, they encouraged the authorities to adopt a policy stance
that maintains real interest rates at positive levels accompanied by a close monitoring of credit
growth, and a fiscal consolidation program that lowers the overall fiscal deficit to a sustainable level
over the medium term.
Directors viewed the favorable prospects for sizable FDI inflows as important for future gains in
productivity and investment, but also as presenting challenges for macroeconomic policy in the
years ahead. They highlighted that continued reliance on FDI inflows of uncertain size and timing
would require a large degree of flexibility in economic policymaking. In this connection, Directors
stressed the need to improve the government’s capacity to generate timely policy responses to
shortfalls of external financing arising from negative balance of payments shocks. Directors were of
the view that those shocks should generally require monetary policy and exchange rate responses,
but also envisaged a role for fiscal tightening in cases where the shocks are large, or more
permanent in nature. Directors cautioned that the option of resorting to the use of international
reserves to cover shortfalls of external financing (especially those stemming from delays in FDIrelated flows) ought to be used sparingly.
Directors viewed structural reforms conducive to higher saving and investment, an improved
business climate, and well-targeted poverty-related spending as critical for sustaining growth and
poverty reduction over the medium term. They encouraged the authorities to quickly complete the
reform of the regulatory and tariff framework for the power sector, and step up efforts to broaden
the tax base and further curtail tax exemptions. Directors also saw scope for improving the
government’s debt management strategy, including by increasing the issuance of long-term
marketable securities and reducing its reliance on treasury bills and the National Savings Schemes
(NSS) to finance the fiscal deficit. Directors welcomed the initiatives underway to modernize the

4

NSS and reform the system of broker-financing of stock trading, but noted that these should be
followed quickly with measures that enable the integration of the NSS with local financial markets.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to maintaining a liberal trade regime and their
determination to contribute to the success of the Doha round of trade talks. They called on the
authorities to resist pressures to reinstate ad-hoc tariff and nontariff measures and broaden export
subsidy schemes.
Directors encouraged the authorities to further improve the quality and timeliness of data, including
by reporting fiscal data on an economic classification. They also urged the authorities to expedite
the process of subscribing to the Special Data Dissemination Standard.

Statement by Abbas Mirakhor, Executive Director for Pakistan
and Iqbal Zaidi, Advisor to Executive Director
November 22, 2006

As noted in the well-written staff report, economic performance during 2005/06 was strong,
despite the impact of negative shocks, including the tragic earthquake of October 2005, a sharp
rise in international oil prices, and unfavorable weather conditions. Reflecting prudent financial
policies and a further broadening of the structural reform efforts, economic growth remained
buoyant, inflation declined, and record-high capital inflows more than covered the larger
external current account deficit and allowed for an increase of nearly US$1 billion in gross
official reserves. The government debt-to-GDP ratio fell to 56 percent by end-June 2006, below
the 60 percent ceiling stipulated in the 2005 Fiscal Responsibility Law, while pro-poor policies
helped lower poverty rates. The authorities and staff agree that over the medium term, the main
challenges to sustaining high output growth are to deepen structural reforms in areas critical for
raising saving and investment, and improving external competitiveness. There was also broad
agreement with the inflation and international reserves objectives, as well as with the
medium-term balance of payments outlook.
Fiscal and monetary policies
Staff have noted that domestic demand pressures have not subsided and that the current account
deficit has increased, driven by rapid import growth. However, real domestic demand growth
slowed to 8.1 percent during FY06 from 11.5 percent. Despite the increase in the government’s
consumption due to earthquake related expenditures, total consumption showed a relatively
small increase of 7.8 percent compared to 11.9 percent in the previous year. The authorities are
firm in their determination to maintain external sustainability and stand ready to implement
policy measures if needed. They expect import growth to decelerate sharply during the year as
the effects of transitory and nonrecurring factors that pushed up imports in 2005/06 (e.g., oil
price spike, unforeseen imports of sugar) unwind. Furthermore, monetary conditions were
tightened in July 2006, which together with continued exchange rate stability, gives comfort that
the inflation rate will decline further. During FY06, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) policy of
keeping the overnight money market rate close to its policy lending rate has proved to be very
effective in reducing the growth of private sector credit. Yearly average overnight rate in FY06
was 7.9 percent compared to 3.8 percent in FY05. The authorities are determined to follow
prudent fiscal and monetary policies, reinforced by a flexible exchange rate. Whereas fiscal
discipline is essential to achieve the authorities’ objectives, and they have demonstrated fiscal
restraint by keeping the underlying budget deficit (the overall deficit excluding grants and
earthquake-related expenditures) at the level of 2005/06, the authorities have also noted that
monetary policy will be tightened further if inflation remains above the government’s
6½ percent target. Over the next couple of years, fiscal policy formulation will take account of

2
the additional demands on government spending created by the earthquake and reconcile them
with macroeconomic stability and poverty-reduction objectives.
The authorities have made progress in their efforts to raise the tax revenue to GDP ratio, and
moreover, have been laying the groundwork for additional reforms to broaden the tax base,
which, because of their complexity and the need for institutional development, will necessarily
take some time. Staff have recognized that efforts to increase the efficiency of tax collection
have continued by streamlining income tax rates, but it should also be stressed that revenue
collection will be enhanced by the considerable progress in other areas. Recent reforms in
improving the documentation of the economy and the move to a greater reliance on
self-assessment and risk-based auditing will make the tax machinery more efficient and
taxpayer-friendly. The authorities have been focusing on further extending the tax net into the
service and agriculture sectors in a meaningful way, and increasing the provinces’ contribution
to overall revenue collection remains an area of continuing attention.
Structural reforms
In addition to tax reforms aimed at broadening the income tax base and reducing rates, major
steps were also taken in other areas such as strengthening the legal framework for investor
protection. The authorities’ reform agenda has attached importance to the financial sector,
including strenuous efforts to improve competition and supervision, which have played a
crucial role in improving efficiency and maintaining the soundness of the sector. The banking
system continued to strengthen, as banks have not only maintained their ranking among the
top half in a group of 44 emerging market countries in terms of indicators of capital adequacy
and asset quality, but have moved to near the top of the ranking in terms of profitability from
a position near the bottom in 2001. The authorities will focus on encouraging higher return
on deposits to promote financial savings. Staff have stressed that new issues of long-term
government securities—e.g., Pakistani Investment Bonds (PIBs)—were essential for the
development of a local bond market, and have encouraged the authorities to substantially
increase reliance on this means of deficit financing during 2006/07. On October 13, 2006,
government raised Rs. 15.03 billion through the placement of 3,5,10,15 and 20 year PIBs at
weighted average yields of 9.78 percent, 9.93 percent, 10.39 percent, 10.85 percent and
11.17 percent, respectively. The sale of the Karachi Electric Supply Company and the partial
sale and transfer of management control of Pakistan Telecommunication Company Limited
were instrumental in revitalizing the privatization process.
Exchange rate
The SBP is committed to exchange rate flexibility, and intervention in the foreign exchange
market is limited to preventing excess volatility; a flexible exchange rate regime has been in
effect since May 19, 1999. The current level of the real exchange rate is broadly appropriate: the
real exchange rate was significantly more depreciated than its level during the 1990s. Regarding
the staff’s classification of Pakistan’s exchange rate regime as a conventional peg, the

3
methodology used is essentially centered on the variability of the nominal exchange rate, and
gives very little weight to other considerations such as foreign exchange intervention and
judgmental elements. The authorities have noted that the movement of the exchange rate within
a narrow band, particularly when this is due to effective policy measures, should not be treated at
par with the exchange rate regime that has been classified as de jure (announced) peg. In the
recent Board meeting on review of exchange rate arrangements, several chairs had stressed that
greater exchange rate stability per se is not sufficient evidence of less flexibility in the exchange
rate regime, since it may just as well reflect a different pattern of shocks to the foreign exchange
market. In particular, a country that experiences a decrease in the intensity and number of shocks
(e.g., terms of trade, cost of borrowing, policy induced) could easily see a stable exchange rate
over a 12-month period. A country should not be encouraged to have a greater fluctuation in the
exchange rate so that it may be categorized as following a de facto floating exchange rate
regime. As regards the intervention in the interbank foreign exchange market, especially in
providing support to meet lumpy payments for petroleum imports, the authorities have pointed
out that a recent study done at the SBP has shown that the effects of intervention on dampening
volatility of the exchange rate are more pronounced compared to the effects on the level of the
exchange rate.
Payments restriction
Regarding the 50 percent limit on advance payments for some imports, the authorities have
pointed out that payments of over 50 percent are not prohibited but require SBP’s approval and
that genuine requests receive blanket approval to effect 100 percent advance payment. They note
that 50 percent advance payment against some imports is an adjustment in the mode of payment,
which is aimed at curbing speculative activity in the market. It has no effect on meeting the
genuine needs of businesses and does not impede any bona fide transactions. Also, importers
have been given blanket approvals to effect 100 percent advance payment where it was either a
supplier’s requirement or global corporate policies, which necessitated such settlements with
companies. Staff agree that the regulation states that requests shall be considered for approval by
the SBP on the basis of evidence of the bona fide nature of the underlying transaction and a bank
guarantee, and all bona fide transactions have been allowed. However, there is an exchange
restriction that could be removed by clarifying the regulations. It is a restriction only insofar as
the authorities have not yet issued the circular that would clarify that despite the various limits
on advance import payments, foreign exchange will be provided without limitations for advance
import payments upon verification of the bona fide nature of the underlying transactions. In
short, there is no payment restriction in the sense of having any real world effects, that is,
affecting current account transactions in a material way that would classify as a payment
restriction. This is entirely a legal issue, with no economic effects, and the authorities are
looking into the exact wording of the regulation that would lead to the removal of this
restriction.

Poverty reduction
Estimates based on the recent Household Integrated Economic Survey (HIES) show that the
share of Pakistan’s population living below the poverty line (poverty headcount ratio) declined
by over 10 percentage points from 2000/01 to 2004/05. Two other key measures of poverty
incidence (the poverty gap and severity of poverty) also showed improvement during the last
four years. Despite this impressive outturn, the authorities are deeply concerned that nearly one
quarter of Pakistan’s population lives below the poverty line. They have reiterated their
commitment to make further inroads in this top priority item, and are determined to increase
spending in health and education because that is a sine qua non for achieving the Millennium
Development Goals.
Investment climate, anti-money laundering, and trade policy
The overall business climate and governance in key macroeconomic institutions have clearly
improved, as attested by the data on fiscal transparency and Doing Business survey of the World
Bank. Notwithstanding this progress, the authorities have stressed that they are determined to
create an environment conducive to investment and improving governance in all public
institutions. Priorities in this area will be to bolster reforms to increase efficiency, transparency,
and accountability in the use of public resources. The anti-money laundering/combating the
financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) framework has been strengthened. In July 2006, the SBP
issued prudential regulations recommended by the Financial Action Task Force. In addition, an
AML/CFT unit has been established in the SBP under the direct supervision of the Governor. On
trade policy, the authorities would like to give the assurance that the progress in bilateral and
regional trade agreements has not compromised Pakistan’s commitment to maintaining a liberal
trade regime and to contribute to multilateral trade negotiations, including their support for a
successful Doha round of trade talks.
Medium-term outlook
The authorities and staff are in broad agreement on the medium-term path for the external
current account deficit, the prospects for external financing, and the targets for international
reserves. Staff have noted that the external current account deficit has reached relatively high
levels and a further widening could compromise external sustainability. The authorities
recognize that the medium-term outlook is subject to various risks, but they note the country’s
increased attractiveness to foreign investors has led to a notable rise in the supply of
non-debt-creating capital flows, as well as relatively low spreads and long maturities in the
recent borrowings from international and regional capital markets. The authorities anticipate that
growth would be somewhat higher than assumed by staff, mainly due to the rapid increases in
foreign direct investment and domestic private investment. The growth in national savings
would outpace the increase in domestic investment, both on account of a gradual rise of real
return to financial savings (as a result of the lower inflation), as well as a decline in the fiscal

5
deficit below 3 percent of GDP over the medium term. The Fiscal Responsibility Law will serve
as a key anchor for sound macroeconomic policies, and the authorities are resolute in their focus
on fiscal and external sustainability, including an ambitious program to increase domestic
revenue.
The authorities value highly their close relationship with the Fund, gratefully acknowledge the
support they have received over the years from the Board, management, and staff and look
forward to the Board discussion.
