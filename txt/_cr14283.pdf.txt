STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
Unleashing Italy’s Potential
The economy is struggling to emerge from a prolonged balance-sheet recession… Tight
credit conditions, weak corporate balance sheets, and deeply-rooted structural rigidities
continue to weigh on domestic demand. The high level of public debt and membership in a
currency union highlight the importance of tackling these structural weaknesses.
…and the risks are tilted to the downside. External risks arise from geopolitical tensions,
while Italy’s high public debt, large public financing needs, and elevated NPLs leave the
economy vulnerable to financial contagion and/or low growth and inflation. Without
meaningful reforms, potential growth is projected to remain low.
Deep structural changes are urgently needed to secure a recovery and unleash Italy’s
growth potential. Moving to a single labor contract with gradually increasing protection
would reduce duality. Judicial efficiency could be improved by promoting mediation and
enhancing monitoring of court performance. Greater efforts to combat corruption would
strengthen the business environment. Implementing reforms simultaneously could be selfreinforcing and generate significant growth synergies.
A greater push to clean up banks’ bad loans is needed to support lending in the
recovery. More provisioning and write-offs; a private distressed debt market; and enhanced
insolvency regime would accelerate the reduction of NPLs. Improved corporate governance
and deeper capital markets would support growth and financial stability.
A broad strategy to revive the SME sector would complement efforts to strengthen
bank balance sheets. This strategy should promote restructuring support for viable, but
distressed firms and a quick exit for those that are non-viable. A new fiduciary loan contract
and greater sharing of credit information could support alternative financing for new
endeavors.
Fiscal policy needs to strike a delicate balance between setting the debt ratio on a
downward path while helping the economy recover. To support growth, the priority
should be to lower marginal tax rates through spending savings and lower tax expenditures.
But given the low growth and high interest rate environment, stronger fiscal balances are
needed to bring down debt faster. Conditional on the recovery taking hold, a modest
structural surplus next year would be appropriate.
Policies at the European level could also support growth by easing further monetary
conditions should inflation remain too low, and reducing financial fragmentation.

A STRUGGLING ECONOMY
1.
The economy is struggling to emerge from a deep balance-sheet recession. Real GDP
contracted in the first half of 2014 by 0.1 percent compared to second half of last year, pushing Italy
back into recession. Exports have held steady, led by demand from non-EU countries, but
investment continues to decline and remains 27 percent below pre-crisis levels. Tight credit
conditions and weak corporate balance sheets continue to weigh heavily on domestic demand.
Moreover, despite the easing fiscal drag, the heavily indebted public sector faces the need of further
consolidation. Leading indicators, such as PMI, point to activity expanding in 2014:H2, but at a
subdued pace. The combination of weak domestic demand and improving global growth has led to
a further narrowing of external imbalances and a modest current account surplus in 2013. Italy’s
share of global exports increased for the first time since 2007.

Sovereign spreads have narrowed significantly but credit conditions remain tight,



Progress on the EU crisis prevention frameworks, the ECB backstop, and a better fiscal position
in Italy have instilled market confidence and reduced sovereign spreads by 320 bps since 2011.



The normalization of the sovereign market, however, has failed to transmit to the credit market,
where real lending rates shot up to 3 percent as inflation fell and nominal rates barely reacted to
accommodative ECB measures (Box 1).



The clearance of government arrears (1.6 percent of GDP to date) partly offset tight credit
conditions. But, surveys indicate that a large share of the payments was used by firms to repay
debt, rather than invest.

Box 1. Impact of Financial Conditions on Growth
Sovereign spreads and market volatility have declined since 2012 but domestic credit conditions have
tightened. The former improves financial stability, but the latter holds back growth, mainly through investment.
Analyzing financial conditions. A Financial Conditions Index (FCI) constructed from a broad set of
indicators permits an analysis of the interactions between financial conditions and the real economy. The FCI
captures in one summary statistic the information in stock market returns, sovereign spreads, the NEER,
inflation expectations, the ECB policy rate and balance sheet, EURIBOR-OIS spread, nominal bank lending
rates, credit volume to the private sector (bank loans and bonds), and lending standards (see ECB
WP 1541 for details). Negative values indicate tighter than average conditions.
Recent developments. The FCI tightened significantly in 2011 and early 2012, but has eased recently on the
back of gains in equities and sovereign spreads and stable bank lending standards. However, nominal
lending rates to the private sector have remained high, which combined with falling inflation, have driven
real lending rates up. The tight conditions despite the ECB’s accommodative stance reflect the persistence of
financial fragmentation in the euro area.

1/ An increase is loosening and a decrease is tightening.

Growth impact. Financial conditions are closely correlated with growth and FCI shocks have a significant
impact on growth. For example, a bivariate VAR under the identifying assumption that the FCI affects growth
with a one-quarter lag suggests that a negative shock that raises real corporate lending rates by 260bps
through a 200bps increase in nominal rates and a 60bps decline in inflation expectations (to 0.5 percent),
would lower growth by a cumulative 0.4 percentage point over three quarters. As a reference, real rates have
increased by around 300 bps since mid-2012.
Policy implications. The analysis suggests that measures to normalize corporate financial conditions would
support a robust and sustained recovery, mainly through investment. Since bank lending rates account for
the lion’s share of the tightening in the FCI, domestic and euro area measures to address financial
fragmentation, mend corporate balance sheets, and strengthen banks’ capacity to lend would minimize the
risk of a weak, creditless recovery.
Caveats. The quantitative results should be interpreted with caution since the model is very parsimonious,
identifies shocks in a crude way, and does not capture factors such as fiscal tightening. Moreover, the model
cannot disentangle different types of structural shocks, for example, both a productivity shock and an easing
in monetary policy raise equity prices.

The persistent slack has resulted in high unemployment and low inflation.



The unemployment rate has stabilized around a post-war high of 12.3 percent (another 2
percent of workers in the wage supplementation scheme are not in the official figures but are
not working). The high incidence of long-term unemployment (58 percent, 20 points above the
OECD average) highlights the difficulty to reemploy workers quickly.



Headline inflation dropped to 0.4 percent (y/y) in 2014:Q2, 0.2 percentage points below the euro
area rate. Volatile components such as energy explain part of the decline but low core inflation
(0.7 percent, y/y) and the nonexistent pass-through of the October 2013 VAT hike suggest that
weak demand and the large output gap (3.8 percent) are significant factors.



Nominal wages increased 1.4 percent (y/y) in the first quarter as inflation dropped leading to a
0.9 percent real increase. Cross-country experience indicates that low-inflation recoveries with
growing real wages are more likely to be jobless (Calvo et al. 2012).

4.
The crisis has affected the Italian regions unevenly. GDP fell 6.7 percent in the north
over 2007–13, but as much as 13.6 percent in the south. The unemployment rate increased about
4 percentage points more in the south than in the north. Regional differences in institutions and
policies help explain the large north-south productivity gap (60 percent) and mixed macroeconomic
performance. These differences potentially offer important lessons for reform priorities going
forward and are therefore explored in more depth in this report.

Progress against the reform agenda has slowed over the last year. The fiscal correction
started by earlier governments continued through 2013. Nonetheless, coalition infighting over a
controversial property tax put on hold further discussions on needed fiscal and structural reforms.
Important reforms of the justice system and labor and product markets have been initiated, but
according to the Bank of Italy (BoI), of the 69 reform laws passed over 2011–13, only half of the
implementing measures have been issued. A new government was sworn in at end6

February and was quick to reaffirm reforms in key areas. But product and service market reform
implementation continues to lag, while efforts to push through the spending review and judicial
reforms face stiff political resistance.

OUTLOOK: A FRAGILE AND UNEVEN RECOVERY
Outlook and risks
6.
Tight financial conditions are expected
to persist and weigh on the recovery. Reflecting
the weak H1 outturn, tight credit and balance
sheet pressures, staff projects growth to be
-0.1 percent in 2014, lagging the rest of the euro
area. For 2015, growth is expected to rise
to 1.1 percent, as steady exports gradually lift
domestic demand. Inflation should pick up slowly
supported by the ECB measures announced in
June, but given the large slack, will remain below
the ECB’s euro area target over the projection
period.

The risks to the outlook are still tilted to the downside. These risks are interconnected
(RAM) and if they were to materialize, regional and global spillovers could be significant (Box 2):


Geopolitical tensions and export slowdown. Disruptions in energy supplies from tensions in
Russia/Ukraine or the Middle East would impact oil and gas prices (Italy imports 90 percent of its
gas) and hurt growth. Italy’s banking and investment exposure to Eastern Europe are another
area of vulnerability. A slowdown in global growth or a further loss of competitiveness would
derail the export-led recovery.



Stagnation and low inflation could translate into a need for further fiscal adjustment in order
to achieve favorable public debt dynamics, especially as growth is forecast to be lower than the
real interest rate paid on debt (see DSA). Low inflation would also reduce prospects for real
wage moderation and worsen corporate debt burdens.



Bond market stress and financial instability. Domestic policy slippages, delays in EU reforms,
or large negative surprises in the European AQR could undermine confidence and push Italy into
a bad equilibrium. As the third largest sovereign bond market, the outward spillovers could be
large.



Reform upside. Rapid progress on the reform agenda could see improved confidence and
activity reinforce each other. The clearance of public sector arrears and unlocking of increased
cash holdings by corporates (2 percent of GDP in 2012–2013) could boost investment more than
expected.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Competitiveness
8.
Reforms are critical to sustaining the recovery and improving productivity and
competitiveness. Growth is projected to average 1 percent during 2014–19, supported by a modest
cyclical recovery. Potential growth estimates remain at around ½ percent, reflecting the trend
decline in productivity and the collapse in investment. As detailed in the External Sector Report
Assessment (Annex), Italy’s external position is broadly consistent but likely still weaker than
suggested by medium-term fundamentals and desirable policy settings. The cyclically-adjusted
current account in 2013 was near balance (0.3 percent of GDP) and very close to the EBA-estimated
norm. However, Italy’s net international investment position (NIIP) has deteriorated by 16 percent of
GDP since joining the Euro area, with net liabilities equal to 29 percent of GDP. Although foreign
investment in portfolio debt securities turned positive in 2013, led by investment in government
securities, Italy remains vulnerable to a loss of market confidence, owing to large refinancing needs
of the sovereign and banking sectors. Given Italy’s weak productivity and competitiveness, a modest
weakening of the real exchange rate would lead to stronger growth, consistent with reducing high
unemployment and public debt, while strengthening the external balance sheet. On this basis, a real
effective depreciation of 0–5 percent, supported by structural reforms and continued progress in
fiscal consolidation, would help close the competitiveness gap and address economic imbalances
over the medium term.
Authorities’ views on economic outlook and risks
9.
The authorities agreed that financial conditions would weigh on the recovery, but
emphasized potential upside risks. While acknowledging downside risks to their 2014 growth
forecast of 0.8 percent, the MEF noted that activity will pick up on account of the reforms
undertaken since 2011 (0.8 percent higher in 2015 relative to a no-reform counter-factual). With
private consumption and machinery investment showing positive growth, they believed the recovery
would take hold in the coming quarters. Tight credit conditions have reduced growth by about
1 percentage point, but this will be mitigated by the clearance of government arrears, reduced
sovereign spreads, and post-AQR confidence going forward. Monetary policy should provide
support as credit risk eases—the BoI estimates that the June ECB announcements would raise
growth by 0.5 percent by 2016, mainly through lower interest rates and a weaker exchange rate. The
authorities expect growth to approach 2 percent in 2018 once all reforms are implemented.
10.
Domestic and external risks have receded against the background of improving global
conditions and domestic political stability. The authorities considered the risk of deflation to be
moderate since energy prices explain a large share of the decline and inflation expectations remain
well anchored. However, the BoI cautioned that the length and depth of the recession had increased
the sensitivity of inflation to the business cycle. Structural changes had increased the frequency of
price adjustment and reduced firm pricing power, steepening the Phillips curve. Following the ECB
actions, the BoI projects inflation to rise to a still low 0.8 percent in 2015 from 0.4 percent this year.
In the short-run, lower inflation could support consumption through higher disposable income. The
authorities agreed that geopolitical tensions, including developments in Russia/Ukraine, along with a
growth slowdown impacting EMs, were the most salient external risks.

1 The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood
of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10
and 30 percent, and “high” a probability between 30 and 50 percent). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions
w ith the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.

ITALY

Box 2. Spillover Implications from Geopolitical Risks and Low Inflation
Italy has sizeable trade and financial exposures to the rest of Europe with a high dependency on
energy imports. On trade, while more than half of Italy’s total merchandise exports are still directed to the
EU, the rebound since 2009 has been driven by exports to non-EU countries exports, including EMs. Italy
imports nearly 80 percent of its energy needs, and it is a net importer of both oil and natural gas. Financially,
the direct exposure of Italian banks to the euro area is also considerable (23 percent of GDP), with the
largest exposures to Germany and Austria.
An increase in geopolitical tensions in Russia/Ukraine and/or the Middle East could affect Italy
through higher energy prices and weaker external demand. Simulations suggest an increase in Russia
and Ukraine tensions that pushes up oil and gas prices by 15–20 percent and increases long-term sovereign
yields by 100 bps could shave up to half a percentage point from GDP growth in Italy over the mediumterm. The shock is modeled as temporary and affects Italy through its energy imports and sensitivities of
investment to tighter financial conditions. The results are consistent with the average growth impact on EU
countries included in the simulation.
Italy is also exposed to geopolitical tensions via
financial and investment linkages. Italian banks’
consolidated claims in Russia and Ukraine total roughly
2 percent of Italy’s GDP, while a significant portion of
profits from Unicredit, Italy’s largest bank, come from
operations in Russia and Ukraine. In addition, Italian
direct investment into Russia and Ukraine has increased
significantly in recent years, reaching US$3 billion
in 2012 after averaging less than US$50 million annually
during 2002-07. However, Italian direct investment
stock in the two countries combined totals less than
1 percent of Italy’s GDP.

Italy can also be a source of outward spillovers to
the rest of the world. The re-emergence of sovereign stress in the Euro area (due to incomplete reforms,
unanticipated outcomes from the AQR and stress tests in the absence of a fiscal backstop) represents a
source of global risk. As highlighted by the DSA, a prolonged period of low growth and inflation could also
weaken the fiscal position and market confidence in the sovereign. Analysis conducted in the context of the
recent FSAP1 and highlighted in the 2014 Triennial Surveillance Review2 shows potential spillover effects to
global banks from an isolated shock to Italian banks and the sovereign are limited given the decline in
global banks’ exposure to Italy since 2008. However, GVAR estimates suggest there are notable spillover
effects from an increase in Italian sovereign credit spreads to those in Ireland, Portugal and Spain. Spillovers
from Italian sovereign spreads to the real sector are small, while cross-border spillovers to GDP are
channeled primarily though real economic ties.

UNLEASHING ITALY’S POTENTIAL
“Ours is a rusty country, a country bogged down, chained by stifling
bureaucracy, by rules, regulations and codes….” - PM Renzi, February 2014
11.
Improving the economy’s growth potential is
critical for addressing the debt overhang risks and
exiting the balance-sheet recession. The challenge is
to transform the institutions that have held back Italy’s
productivity. They include a fragmented labor market
unwilling to invest in young workers; an inefficient and
lengthy judicial system that discourages investment; an
ineffective and indebted public sector reliant on high
taxes; and a financial system saddled with bad loans and
hamstrung in its ability to provide credit. As a member
of a currency union, addressing these structural and
balance sheet weaknesses takes on greater importance.

PM Renzi’s reform agenda aims to overhaul
the system. A new government outlined an agenda to reform the electoral law, the labor market,
judicial system, and public sector. Following the passage of the Delega Fiscale (tax reform) the
government intends to take forward measures to simplify and improve the tax system.
13.
Delivery of real change is now crucial for strengthening confidence and securing a
robust recovery. Pursuing wide-ranging reforms simultaneously would also be self-reinforcing and
generate growth synergies. The following structural reforms are priorities to unblocking Italy’s
productivity and growth potential.

A. Structural Reforms for Revitalizing the Business Environment
Labor reforms need to tackle pervasive duality and better align worker and firm
incentives
Context

Labor market reform is one of the cornerstones of PM Renzi’s agenda… The
“Jobs Act” outlines ideas for universal unemployment benefits tied to training and
job-search; a national agency responsible for coordinating active policies (ALMP);
and rationalized contracts with more flexibility. Legislation thus far has focused on
increasing flexibility at the margin, by reducing restrictions on short-term hires, and
boosting female participation with tax incentives.
…but dismal labor prospects and stagnant productivity call for more radical
action. With 70 percent of new contracts being temporary, additional flexibility at
the margin does little to reduce duality and incentivize investment in workers.

Implementation Status

Link unemployment support to employability. In deep recessions,
the current wage supplementation scheme hampers reallocation of
labor from unprofitable firms and should shift to a more universal
support system conditional on job search and training.

Proposed in Jobs Act but
not yet implemented.

Simple contracts. A single labor contract with gradually increasing
protection would enhance fairness by reducing duality, especially if it
were to replace open-ended contracts. Grandfathering could ease
adjustment to the new system.

Staff proposal goes further
than the “trial” contract in
Jobs Act.

National coordination of ALMP. Build on the experience of successful
schemes like Finland’s, to reduce regional disparities and improve
monitoring and evaluation. Greater information sharing on job
openings and seekers could create new markets for more flexible work,
especially among women and the elderly, similar to U.K. and U.S. job
exchanges.

Staff goes beyond Jobs Act
and suggests new marketbased institutions for job
matching.

Decentralized wage setting. To allow firms to adapt more quickly to
changing economic conditions, Italy should promote more firm-level
wage bargaining, together with greater flexibility in national contracts
e.g. on non-wage terms such as shifts and working hours.

The idea is not included in
the Jobs Act.

Authorities’
Views

The authorities underscored that the short-term priority has been to create
new jobs. Lifting restrictions on temporary contracts was an urgent measure to
boost labor demand in the face of very high unemployment. Moving forward, the
authorities will develop options to improve ALMPs and design an experimental
contract with gradually increasing protection. Social partners noted the difficulty of
implementing the new experimental contract, while keeping existing temporary
contracts. They also highlighted the need to increase labor market participation and
welcomed the idea of creating job exchanges.
On wage setting, the authorities pointed out that moving to a fully
decentralized system could prove costly and disruptive. They agreed firm-level
bargaining should be more representative, but noted that it would be costly to
negotiate all terms of a labor contract at the firm level. Some national-level template
is needed. Labor economists highlighted the importance of sufficient flexibility in
national-level agreements to allow for firm-level differences linked to productivity.

Judicial reforms to improve court efficiency would have wide ranging benefits
Context

The lengthy judicial process is a major factor behind Italy’s weak business
environment. It takes more than a thousand days to enforce a contract in Italy—

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

ITALY

more than twice the OECD average. The huge backlog (5.2 million civil cases) is
slowly decreasing but remains an obstacle to improving judicial performance.
Greater judicial efficiency would bring cross-sector benefits by lowering the
cost of credit, encouraging investment, and facilitating employment. Staff
analysis of regional disparities finds that halving the duration of labor disputes is
associated with an increase in probability of employment by about 8 percent. Recent
reforms, such as the increase in court fees, are welcome, but the judicial system is
still slow compared to the European

Judicial reform remains a priority for the government. The backlog of cases fell
by 11 percent since 2009 and processing times were reduced by an average of
3.7 percent since 2011. The authorities are now exploring options to use assisted
dispute resolution, restrict appeals to the Supreme Court, and reinforce commercial
courts. They pointed to future efficiency gains from the introduction of electronic
document filing, and the positive reaction to the idea of monitoring court
performance. The authorities earlier proposed dropping the requirement for lawyers
to participate in compulsory mediation—Italy is one of the few EU countries that
requires lawyers to be present—but faced stiff resistance by the legal profession
which succeeded in reinstating the requirement in parliament.

Greater efforts against corruption are needed to improve the business environment
Context

Public sector corruption remains a serious problem in Italy. Although crosscountry comparisons are challenging, Italy fares poorly in global rankings of
perceptions of corruption, e.g. according to Transparency International Italy ranks
30 out of 31 among high income OECD countries in perceptions of corruption. The
authorities highlighted linkages between corruption and money laundering.

Advice

The anti-corruption legal framework should be further enhanced. The
effectiveness of anti-corruption efforts could be improved by criminalizing the false
accounting offense and changing the statute of limitation provisions.

Currently, the statute of limitations continues to run after the first instance court
judgment becomes final. This means that with typically lengthy appeals procedures
for corruption, cases may be dismissed as time-barred even after a first instance
conviction. One option could be to change the law to re-start the limitation period
after the first instance court decision.
Authorities’
Views

The authorities agreed on the importance of sustained action against
corruption. They noted that the 2012 anti-corruption legislation aligns the legal
framework with relevant international standards and lays the foundation for effective
anti-corruption activities. Since 2013, the BoI requires enhanced due diligence by
financial institutions in their dealings with domestic “politically exposed persons”, in
line with international standards and as recommended by staff last year. The
government recently approved measures to provide greater powers to the national
anti-corruption authority (ANAC).

Accelerate competition policy reforms to improve the business environment
Advice

Authorities’
Views

Rapid implementation of reforms in sectors that are essential inputs to
production would support growth. Progress has been made on some measures,
such as the liberalization of the gas sector. But, in other areas, notably the opening
up of professional services and privatization of local services, reforms have stalled.
The transport authority was legally established in 2011 but is still understaffed.
Addressing these staffing shortages, opening up the legal profession and enhancing
competition in the retail sector would reduce markups and raise productivity. The
short-term adjustment costs from liberalization could be offset by improved
sentiment and new investment in deregulated sectors.
The authorities pointed to important liberalization measures on the horizon.
They have committed to legislate the recommendations of the antitrust authority by
September 2014—an important first step to enhancing competition, encouraging
new entrants, and lowering the cost of services. The reform timeline includes an
initiative to restructure rail and local public transport by end-2014.

B. A Financial Sector That Supports Growth and Investment
A greater push to clean up bad loans would support new lending in the recovery
Context

16

The European AQR is leading Italian banks to recognize further losses and raise
capital… Ahead of the AQR, the large Italian banks booked net losses of nearly
€22 billion in 2013, announced plans to dispose of NPLs and have raised €11 billion
in capital. The foundation owner of Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena sold most of its
shares in the bank, and after raising €5 billion in capital in June, repaid the bulk of its
state aid.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ITALY

…but, NPLs continue to rise and
deleveraging persists. Since 2007, the NPL
ratio has tripled to 16 percent at end2013, and has reached 29 percent for
corporate loans (higher in the South). The
largest increase has been for “bad debt”
loans in insolvency (“sofferenze”). The
continued rise in NPLs has weighed heavily
on banks’ profits, pushed up lending rates,
and added to the pressures on banks to
deleverage and reduce their risk exposure.

rising NPL stock, write-off rates continue to
decline, while recent NPL sales have been
limited to those in default over ten years. Provisioning has improved but the
coverage varies—it is lower in mid-size banks where capital buffers are thin and
weak governance has made it difficult to raise outside capital. NPLs disposal is also
hindered by the slow recovery process (three years to foreclose on collateral and
seven years to complete a bankruptcy). Italy ranks 21 out of 31 among high income
OECD countries in resolving insolvency (Doing Business).
Advice

Cleaner balance sheets would free up resources for financing the recovery.
Write-off rates would need to triple from their historic average to bring the bad debt
ratio to pre-crisis levels within 10 years, suggesting that a greater push by all
stakeholders is urgently needed to accelerate NPL disposals. A three-pronged
approach should be considered:
a) Stronger provisioning and write offs. Supervisory guidelines could foster
convergence in provisioning rates, including forbearance loans under the
moratorium program—this could provide incentives for banks to coordinate and be
more pro-active in addressing problem loans. To encourage write-offs, the
supervisor could monitor bank progress in working out NPLs and conduct targeted
on-site inspections of loan collection performance. As tried in other countries (Japan,
United States), the supervisor could also impose higher capital charges or time-limits
for writing off old NPLs.
b) Develop the distressed debt market. An active NPL market would provide an
alternative to lengthy bankruptcy, draw in needed financing, and boost loan recovery
values. Private NPL asset management companies (AMCs) could be encouraged
through tax incentives (accelerated depreciation or preferential capital gains), while
ensuring bad assets are transferred at fair market value.
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

ITALY

c) Enhanced enforcement and insolvency regimes. The authorities should expand
specialized insolvency benches within courts and introduce time-limits to expedite
business reorganization. Adopting international best practice guidelines along the
INSOL Principles for Multi-Creditor Workouts could encourage more out-of-court
workouts. Also, greater reliance on online court filings could speed up foreclosures.
Authorities’
Views

After weathering the crisis, Italian banks have made great efforts to clean up
balance sheets without significant State support. The authorities stressed that the
inflow of new bad debt is beginning to stabilize. Encouragingly, banks are exploring
market-based solutions for NPL management and disposal, capitalizing on growing
foreign interest. However, the financial and operational challenges for banks to work
through large NPLs are significant. With respect to harmonizing provisions, they
noted that supervisory responsibility, including for minimum prudential standards on
provisioning, would be transferred to the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) in the
fall. Tax incentives to jumpstart the distressed debt market may also conflict with
state aid rules.
The authorities highlighted that past BoI inspections had helped prepare banks
for the ECB comprehensive balance sheet assessment. The 2012 BoI loan
inspections covered 40 percent of NPLs using a conservative definition in line with
the EBA standards, and tightened collateral valuation. One difference, however, is
that the ECB’s AQR is also looking at performing loans, including those under the
loan moratorium program, which could push provisioning needs higher. In response
to regulatory pressure, some mid-tier banks are preparing plans for possible capital
needs later this year. In line with the European Council decision, the authorities are
putting in place national arrangements for resolution mechanism and public
backstops and stressed the need to coordinate closely these arrangements at the
European level.

Improvements in corporate governance would also strengthen capital raising and
stability
Governance

18

Reforms to improve bank corporate governance should continue. The BoI has
taken steps to strengthen the role of independent board members and the “fit and
proper” test for directors. The role of the foundations has also diminished, as banks
have sought outside sources of capital. Governance reforms should continue by
requiring published audited accounts by foundations participating in banks, limits on
their leverage, and proper governance rules. The ban on foundations controlling
banks should be applied in practice, and over time, foundations should reduce their
stake in banks within proper concentration limits. The largest cooperative banks
should also be encouraged to convert to joint stock companies and consolidate as a
way to achieve synergies.

Capital
Markets

Deeper capital markets could diversify sources of finance and support new
lending activity. Italian corporates rely more on debt versus equity—with debt-toequity ratios 17 percentage points higher than the Euro area average (123 percent).
Italian institutional investors’ exposure to equities is limited, with just 16 percent of
pension assets in equities (compared to 50 percent for the largest international
pension funds) and less than 1 percent in Italian equities. Encouraging institutional
investors, such as pension funds, to raise their allocation in equities and alternative
assets, to be more in line with those of other large global investors with the
appropriate benchmarks would expand the supply of long-term risk capital.
Reducing the tax bias against equity financing would encourage family-owned firms
to seek more outside equity. Over time, reducing the gap between the taxation of
public and private securities would also support more investment in the private
capital markets.

Authorities’
Views

The authorities highlighted that the shift to the SSM could foster Europe-wide
consolidation and a rethink of banks’ business models. Italian banks have made
progress in cutting branch networks (by 7 percent since 2008), while scope still exists
to incorporate technology in retail banking. Rising compliance costs and greater
competition at the European level will likely add to bank pressures to lower costs
and seek out appropriate mergers. On corporate governance, a newly issued BoI
regulation and a draft decree pending Parliament’s approval will implement most of
the IMF’s FSAP recommendations, including the power to remove board members
(Appendix II). On the foundations, the BoI has argued that the ban on foundations
controlling banks be enforced to facilitate capital raising and consolidation.

A range of measures have been undertaken to support equity investment in
corporates and mobilize new sources of financing. These include an enhanced
Allowance for Corporate Equity (ACE) program, which expands tax benefits for
increasing retained earnings and raising public equity; elimination of withholding tax
on medium- and long-term financing for foreign-based investors; proposals to allow
direct lending to firms by insurance companies and other non-banks; and a proposal
to allow for multiple-voting shares to encourage family-run SMEs to raise outside
equity capital.

A broad strategy to revive the SME sector would complement financial sector reform
Context

SMEs are the backbone of the Italian economy… SMEs account for about
80 percent of the corporate workforce and 70 percent of firm value added in Italy.
They are more prevalent and smaller than elsewhere in the euro area.
…but they are suffering more
from the financial crisis. Italian
SMEs suffer from high leverage and
weak profitability and are more
vulnerable to financial stress than
large firms. Their small size and low
productivity are particularly evident
in the trade and tourism sectors.
Compared to the euro area,
business startup and firm exit rates
are lower, limiting the economies
ability to innovate and shift
resources to more productive areas.

A broad based strategy to assist SMEs growth and restructuring will strengthen
balance sheets and improve productivity. Such a strategy is complementary to
efforts to reduce bank NPLs:


Guidelines for creditor-led restructuring. Establishing standard criteria for
assessing SME loans and guidelines for restructuring viable, but distressed, firms
could help overcome creditor coordination problems and encourage greater use
of the insolvency regime and out-of-court workouts. This would help identify
non-viable firms for a quick exit and open opportunities for a “fresh start.”
Shifting public support schemes away from guarantees and moratorium for
existing firms to financing for new firms could support the restructuring process.



New fiduciary loan contract. Efficient collateral enforcement mechanisms that do
not rely on court decisions could expand the availability and lower the cost of
credit. A new loan contract based on fiduciary arrangements could allow quick

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

21

ITALY

and efficient enforcement in the event of default (Box 3). Introducing a
nationwide electronic registry for all types of collateral would support the use of
fiduciary contracts.


Authorities’
Authorities’
Views
Response

Greater sharing of credit information. The system of credit registries and bureaus
is fragmented with limited sharing of information. Expanding access to the key
registries by nonbanks and including other relevant data such as payments on
taxes, retail credit, and utility bills would improve credit monitoring and support
the shift from collateral-based to a more risk-based lending.

The authorities highlighted active government support as crucial for relieving
the SME credit squeeze during the crisis. These included a moratorium scheme for
SME loans (currently covering some €23 billion in principal), rapid expansion of the
Central Guarantee Fund and support to bank lending through the Cassa Depositi e
Prestiti. The payment of government arrears (some 60 billion planned over 2 years)
would also give liquidity support to SMEs. The Fondo Italiano d’Investimento was
created in 2009 to invest in SME risk capital to help them grow and aggregate.
On a new loan contract, the authorities had explored modifying existing
contracts to allow for 3rd party collateral, but this was difficult to implement
without a new law. Instead, they are now considering introducing guarantees on
movable property and have presented draft legislation to Parliament in December
2013. Greater sharing of credit information is welcome but faces challenges from
Italy’s data privacy laws.

Policies at the European level could also support growth by easing monetary conditions
and reducing financial fragmentation
14.
Recent ECB actions have helped to ease financial conditions… Bank funding costs have
eased and several banks have reissued unsecured senior debt. The improvement in funding
conditions has also facilitated a gradual repayment of the LTRO, with Italian banks having repaid
one third of their Eurosystem borrowing. According to the BoI, recent ECB measures (T-LTRO) could
provide liquidity of more than €200 billion over the life of the program. The BoI will extend the pool
of eligible collateral for refinancing operations to SME loans and mortgages and is also exploring
ways to allow for refinancing of overdraft bills, which are widespread among SMEs.
15.
…but more can be done. The spread between the yield on bank bonds and the swap rate
has diminished, but fragmentation across the Euro area still persists and euro area inflation is below
the ECB’s target. If inflation remains too low, the ECB should consider a substantial expansion of its
balance sheet, including through asset purchases. Faster progress towards the banking union will
further reduce financial fragmentation. Italy needs to play its part, for example by completing
national arrangements for resolution and backstopping in advance of the ECB assessment.

22

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ITALY

Discussions are ongoing between the MEF and BOI on the national backstop, while legal
impediments to bail-in remain. Finalizing the national backstop and clarifying the bail-in process
would enhance the predictability of the resolution framework.
Box 3. A New Fiduciary Loan Contract for Efficient Collateral Enforcement
Efficient collateral enforcement mechanisms that do not necessarily rely on court decisions could
expand the availability and lower the cost of credit for small firms. Civil law jurisdictions, such as Italy’s,
are increasingly considering the concept of fiducia (fiduciary ownership agreements) as a way to facilitate
contract enforcement of collateral outside the court system. In a fiduciary agreement, a borrower will receive
a loan from a lender in exchange for transferring the title, but not the possession, of certain assets (collateral)
to a fiduciary, third party. If the loan is repaid in full, the title reverts to the borrower. If the borrower
defaults, the fiduciary party transfers the asset title to the lender without resorting to the courts. The lender
benefits from reduced uncertainty, time and cost of securing the collateral. The borrower benefits not only
from a lower cost and broader access to credit, but also from maintaining possession and use of the
underlying collateral for his or her ongoing business, e.g. machinery.

Brazil and France have introduced these types of contracts recently:


France. In 2006, the French Civil Code was amended to include the so-called “fiducie-sûreté.” This is
a contract by which the full title is transferred to a lender or to a third party to secure the payment
of the borrower’s debt. On default, the “fiduciary party” may realize the assets and use the proceeds
to repay the loan. Any surplus is repaid to the borrower. The French law is also very flexible, allowing
all kinds of present or future assets to be transferred to the fiduciary.



Brazil. In 2004, the notion of “Fiduciary Ownership Agreements” was introduced whereby a
borrower, as security for its obligation, transfers the ownership of a movable property to the lender,
keeping possession of the asset until the debt is repaid. The lender acquires a limited, transitory and
conditional property, which is automatically extinguished upon repayment of the debt. The asset
given in collateral may be recovered by the lender through summary proceedings in case of default.

These types of fiduciary arrangements do not exist in Italy and could have cross-cutting benefits. In
addition to expanding credit availability, such a fiduciary contract could also enhance market discipline by
strengthening contract enforcement. Allowing borrowers to voluntarily switch to a fiduciary contract in
exchange for a lower rate could also signal their willingness to repay. Efficient foreclosure arrangements
could also support alternative means of financing, such as factoring or securitization of SME loans; unlock
other forms of collateral besides real estate, and foster a market for credit insurance, such as for trade credit.

C. Boosting Growth Through Fiscal Policy
An ambitious rebalancing to lower marginal taxes and boost productive spending is
needed…
Context

The public sector budget in Italy suffers from a number of distortions that hold
back growth. Marginal tax rates on capital and labor are high. The government
reduced the personal income tax (PIT) for low earners by around ½ percent of GDP
in 2014 (roughly 1,000 euro per household), but at around 48 percent of total labor
cost, the labor tax wedge is well above the OECD average of 36 percent. Public
spending has one of the highest elderly bias and lowest levels of education spending
in the EU, leaving little room for ALMP and education policies to strengthen
productivity and employment. The efficiency of public spending also varies
considerably across regions, with the South being the weakest (Box 4).

Advice

Lower marginal tax rates are needed… Further reductions in the labor tax wedge
should come through lower social security contributions instead of cuts to personal
income tax to better support new employment. The increase in the tax allowance for
corporate equity returns (ACE) is welcome and should be extended.
…by generating more durable savings. The PIT cut was partly funded by one-off
measures, such as the VAT on arrears payments and taxes on revalued shares at the
BoI. More permanent measures to finance tax cuts are needed, including through
lower tax expenditures, higher taxes on wealth (including inheritance taxes), and
additional savings from the spending review. Stronger efforts to curb tax evasion
would generate savings and raise the fairness of fiscal adjustment.
The spending review is an important mechanism to address intergenerational
imbalance and improve public efficiency. Key areas for improvement are in
pensions, health and addressing large regional gaps in efficiency. With previous
pension reforms having strengthened long-term sustainability, the focus should shift
to finding savings from current pensions, such as through higher progressive
indexation. For health, large regional differences in spending efficiency suggest
room for savings. Greater differentiation of public wages across regions would not
only generate savings, but also better link wages to productivity in the private sector.
Savings could be used not only to lower marginal tax rates, but also to shift
resources towards education, active labor market policies, and public investments—
including EU-co financed projects where absorption remains low.

Authorities’
Views

The authorities agreed that reorienting budget priorities required more
permanent savings, but this would be challenging. The cut in PIT was intended
primarily to stimulate domestic demand, with the aim now to improve its targeting.
Going further would be difficult, given the additional need to make the PIT cut
permanent. The authorities viewed age-related spending as sustainable, albeit high.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

25

ITALY

Prospects for further pension changes, including progressive indexation for existing
pensioners, was seen as limited given the significant reforms already enacted.

…while a stronger primary balance is needed to bring down public debt, given the low
growth and high interest rate environment
Context

The pace of fiscal consolidation is set to ease after tough adjustment… The
structural primary surplus improved from 0.7 to 4.5 percent of GDP between
2011 and 2013 and is now one of the highest in the euro area and close to its debtstabilizing level. Given the weak growth, the nominal headline deficit is expected to
remain at 3 percent of GDP this year but fall short of a zero structural balance under
Italy’s new fiscal rule. For 2015, the authorities plan a ½ percent of GDP adjustment
to narrow the structural deficit to -0.1 percent of GDP.
…but not by too much. Italy’s public debt is sustainable but subject to significant
risks. Public debt is set to rise further, peaking at 136 percent of GDP in 2014, due to
slower growth and one-off operations from arrears clearance. Under the baseline,
public debt is projected to decline modestly to 125 percent of GDP by 2019 but
remain vulnerable to adverse shocks, especially from weak growth and low inflation
(see DSA). Market funding conditions have been relatively benign, supported by
ample global liquidity, but real borrowing rates still exceed economic growth rates.
With annual gross financing needs of 24 percent of GDP (almost €400 billion), Italy is
also vulnerable to swings in market sentiment.

Advice

Conditional on the recovery taking hold, a modest structural surplus next year
would be appropriate to bring down debt faster. In the short-term, fiscal policy
needs to strike a delicate balance between setting the debt ratio on a downward
path while helping the economy recover. An additional adjustment compared to the
authorities’ plans (up to ½ percent of GDP depending on the strength of recovery)
would help achieve a small structural surplus by 2015. If growth turns out weaker
than expected, a slower pace of consolidation—but still enough to reduce the debt
ratio—would be appropriate.

Once the recovery is firmly underway, maintaining a structural surplus would
bring down debt more quickly. Beyond 2015, after the recovery is entrenched, a
1 percent of GDP structural surplus buffer would provide valuable insurance against
shocks and generate additional interest savings over time (to lower taxes further).
Accelerating the privatization program (0.7 percent of GDP annually
through 2017), particularly at the local level, would reduce debt faster and support
investment.
Authorities’
Views

The authorities believed that the key to sustainable debt reduction is higher
growth rather than further consolidation. Given the impact of earlier fiscal
consolidation and the fragility of the recovery, they viewed further near-term
adjustment as having a potentially counterproductive impact on confidence and derailing the recovery. They noted their intention to pursue greater flexibility within the
EU fiscal governance rules in exchange for more structural reforms. Furthermore,
while they agreed that a structural surplus buffer would be helpful over the mediumterm, they viewed their target of a structural balance as appropriate for securing
long-term sustainability.

Stronger budget institutions will improve fiscal performance and the quality of spending
Context

Progress has been made in building fiscal institutions. The creation of the
Parliamentary Budget Office (PBO) lays the foundation for an independent institution
that can strengthen monitoring and credibility of the fiscal rules. In June, the
government approved a public administration reform plan that includes measures to
simplify bureaucratic procedures. Steps have been taken to simplify tax procedures
and reform the cadastral land survey.

Advice

Establishing a medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF) would improve
budget planning and spending efficiency. The spending review should be a
permanent feature of the multi-year budget process to enhance policy prioritization,
monitoring and accountability. Performance information should be collected
systematically to promote the use of output indicators and activity costing.
Budgetary rules should facilitate reallocation of resources towards policy priorities,
and ministries should be held accountable for achieving those priorities. For the
newly established PBO, it would be important to ensure adequate access to fiscal
data to strengthen its oversight function.
Stronger efforts to curb tax evasion would generate savings and increase
fairness. These efforts should include greater use of the anti-money laundering
framework, such as criminalizing self-laundering. Greater information sharing would
also help e.g., between the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) and the “fiscal registry”
(anagrafe tributaria).

Box 4. Italy’s Spending Review and the Efficiency of Public Spending1
As part of their rebalancing efforts, the authorities have undertaken a spending review to identify
potential areas of efficiency–enhancing savings. The spending review commission issued its report in
March which identified potential savings of €34 billion over 2014–16 (Table) across various areas, such as in
procurement and transfers. The government has approved measures of €3 billion for 2014, mainly focused
on administrative efficiency measures.

low, providing little room for savings. However, outcome
indicators, such as income inequality, poverty risk and tertiary education attainment are relatively weak,
suggesting scope for improving spending efficiency.

Regional analysis also shows that spending efficiency is generally weaker in Southern regions that are
poorer and more reliant on outside transfers.
Efficiency Score for
Public Health by Regions
Health care spending, which has been a major source of spending
pressure over the past decade, represents a large share of regional
spending and is much higher in the south. Staff analysis suggests that
bringing efficiency scores in 2011 to national average levels in the low
performing regions could have provided savings of almost 1 percent
of GDP; the figure is likely smaller now following the spending reforms
in recent years. The introduction of standard costs in health care was
important in this regard. Improving allocation of regional transfers in
other functions using standard costs based on more efficient
benchmarks (fabbissogno standard) could provide another source of
savings. Swift parliamentary approval of the legislation determining
standard costs would be needed.

Authorities’
Response

Reforms to fiscal and budgetary institutions are ongoing. The authorities agreed
on the MTEF as a useful policy tool, which will be introduced in the near term. The
authorities have also intensified their fight against tax evasion and have raised their
target of collecting unpaid taxes by €2 billion for 2015. Additional PFM reforms such
as electronic invoicing and cash budgeting at local levels are being implemented to
fight tax evasion and ensure that new arrears do not arise. The PBO is working on a
MOU with the Treasury on the PBO’s involvement in the budget process and plans to
issue its first report in the fall on compliance with the fiscal rule.

STAFF APPRAISAL
16.
The economy is struggling to emerge from its deep balance-sheet recession… Steady
exports and an easing fiscal drag are being offset by the stiff headwinds to investment from tight
credit conditions, especially for indebted SMEs, and deeply-rooted structural rigidities. Growth is
projected to be -0.1 percent in 2014, rising gradually to 1.1 percent in 2015. Inflation is forecast to
remain low.
17.
…and the risks are tilted to the downside. Italy is exposed to geopolitical tensions in
Russia and Ukraine as well as the Middle East through trade and investment linkages. In addition,
the high public debt, large public financing needs, and elevated NPLs leave Italy vulnerable to
financial contagion and/or low growth and inflation. Failure to follow through on the reform agenda
will exacerbate Italy’s declining productivity and weak medium-term growth prospects.
18.
The improvement in the current account has reduced external imbalances. However,
productivity and competitiveness indicators point to an external position weaker than suggested by
medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies. A modest weakening of the REER would lead to
stronger growth, and a healthier external balance sheet.
19.
Deep structural changes are urgently needed to unleash Italy’s growth potential,
secure a robust recovery and address debt overhang risks. Implementing structural reforms
simultaneously would be self-reinforcing and generate significant growth synergies:


Labor reforms. A labor contract with gradually increasing protection would reduce duality and
encourage firms to invest in workers. Raising the quality of ALMP to the level of the best
regions, with centralized monitoring, would help address long-term unemployment. Promoting
firm-level bargaining through greater flexibility under national contracts would better align
wages to productivity.



Judicial reforms. To speed up the judicial process, consideration could be given to reviewing
court fees, limiting excessive appeals, developing performance indicators for all courts, and
incentivizing the use of mediation. Disseminating regional best practices would help reduce the
performance gap.

30

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ITALY



Competition policy. Legislative initiatives have been put forward over the years to remove
regulatory barriers in many markets, but implementation has been weak. Delivering on the
commitment to legislate recommendations of the antitrust authority would enhance
competition and lower the cost of services.



Corruption. The 2012 anti-corruption legislation and recent measures to enhance the power of
ANAC represent important steps. The legal framework could be further improved, notably by
criminalizing the false accounting offense and changing the statute of limitation provisions.

20.
A greater push to clean up bad loans would support lending in the recovery… BoI
inspections and the European AQR have improved provisioning coverage ratios and strengthened
confidence, but NPLs continue to rise, weighing on bank profits and lending. Encouraging more
provisioning and write-offs; developing the distressed debt market; and enhancing the insolvency
regime would help accelerate the reduction of NPLs and free up resources for the recovery.
21.
...while, a broad strategy to revive the SME sector would complement financial
reforms. This strategy should support viable firms and identify non-viable firms for a quick exit. Key
elements include adopting a more standardized approach to assessing SME loans and restructuring
viable, but distressed firms through insolvency or out-of-court workouts; introducing a new fiduciary
loan contract to speed up the enforcement of collateral; and greater sharing of corporate credit
information to support the development of alternative financing sources. Forms of support that do
not distinguish between viable and non-viable firms should be scaled back.
22.
Further improvements in corporate governance and deeper capital markets would
support growth and financial stability. Reducing the influence of foundations controlling banks
and encouraging cooperative banks to convert to joint-stock companies would strengthen capital
raising and market discipline. Promoting professional management of pension funds, while ensuring
adequate safeguards are put in place, would draw in more equity investment in Italian firms.
23.
Fiscal policy needs to strike a delicate balance between setting the debt ratio on a
downward path while helping the economy recover. To support the economy, the priority should
be to lower the tax burden financed by savings from the spending review and lower tax
expenditures. Following difficult adjustment, Italy has achieved one of the highest primary surpluses
in the euro area. However, more still needs to be done to bring down the high level of public debt
given the low growth and higher interest rate environment. Conditional on the recovery taking hold,
a modest structural surplus next year would be appropriate to strengthen public finances.
24.
Adopting an MTEF would improve budget planning and spending efficiency. Making
the spending review a permanent part of the multi-year budget process would enhance
accountability and monitoring, while performance information should be integrated systematically
to promote the use of output indicators and activity costing for budget allocation. For the newly
established PBO, it would be important to ensure adequate access to fiscal data to strengthen its
oversight function.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

31

ITALY

25.
Policies at the European level could also support growth. If inflation remains too low, the
ECB should consider further easing measures, while faster progress towards the banking union will
help address financial fragmentation. Italy needs to play its part in the EU process, for example by
completing arrangements for resolution and backstopping in advance of the ECB assessment.
26.

It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation be held in the usual

12-month cycle.

Annex I. Debt Sustainability Analysis
Italy’s public debt is sustainable but subject to significant risks. Italy’s public debt ratio continues to rise,
and at around 136 percent of GDP, is the second highest in the euro area. External financing
requirements and gross public financing needs are also large due to the rollover of existing debt. Most
of the public debt is held domestically. Market risks are mitigated by the long duration of debt, much of
which is under a fixed interest rate. The main risk stems from a growth shock, in the absence of
structural reforms, which could result in an unfavorable macro-fiscal dynamics. Contingent liabilities in
the financial sector also constitute a significant risk.

1.
Macroeconomic and fiscal assumptions: The assumptions underpinning the DSA are those
of the baseline scenario of the staff report. Real GDP growth is projected at 0.1 percent in 2014,
increasing to around 1 percent in the medium term. Inflation is projected at around 1.5 percent over
the medium term. The structural balance improves annually to meet the zero balance as required
under the fiscal rule. In 2014, however, cyclically adjusted balance implies a slight relaxation. Spreads
are assumed to moderate from current levels. However, yields are expected to rise over the medium
term and the effective interest rate is forecast to rise from 4.0 percent in 2014 to 4.4 percent in 2019.
2.
The DSA tool that assesses the realism of the main assumptions on growth, primary
balance, and inflation does not indicate systematic forecast errors.


While growth outcomes in Italy have sometimes tended to be worse than projected, the current
growth projections are in line with consensus but below the authorities’ forecasts. Near–term
risks are broadly balanced. The recent government initiative on electoral and structural reforms
and arrears clearance provide upside risks for growth potential. Nevertheless, the trend decline in
productivity and investment collapse along with risks of a confidence shock given the large debt
levels pose downside risks for long-term growth. Inflation projection errors have been small
historically. Nevertheless, the risk of deflation is a particular concern given its implications on
debt dynamics and the weak medium-term outlook.



The maximum projected 3-year adjustment in the cyclically-adjusted primary balance is large, but
the bulk of that adjustment was already undertaken in 2012 and 2013 and Italy currently has the
second largest structural primary balance in the Euro area. However, the weak recovery may
create pressure to relax the fiscal targets, which raises the risks of a slower pace of future
consolidations.

3.
The definition of public debt comprises Excessive Deficit Procedure (EDP) debt of the
General Government. The General Government includes the Central Government, Regional
Governments, Local Government, and Social Security Funds. It excludes public enterprises. EDP debt
is a subset of General Government consolidated debt such as trade credits and other accounts
payable. Stocks are recorded at their face value and thus usually exclude unpaid accrued interest.

Baseline
4.
Staff forecast that the debt-to-GDP ratio will peak at 136 percent in 2014, before
declining to 124 percent in 2019. The debt profile is projected to be higher than a year ago as
slower fiscal adjustment, the additional arrears clearance program (0.8 percent of GDP), along with
the lower-than-projected nominal growth are forecast to push up the debt ratio.
5.
While gross financing needs are expected to remain sizeable over the medium term,
rollover risks are mitigated by the long–term debt structure. Italy remains vulnerable to a loss in
market confidence, owing to the large refinancing needs. Government financing requirements, at
24 percent of GDP, and external financing requirements at 48 percent of GDP, remain large.
Nevertheless given the public debt structure with an average maturity under 6½ years and
70 percent of debt with fixed interest rate, the refinancing risks are mitigated somewhat. The direct
interest pass-through to the budget is relatively slow; a 100 basis points shock to the yield curve is
estimated to raise the interest bill by just over 0.16 percent of GDP in the first year, 0.34 percent in
the second year and 0.44 percent in the third year. Almost 2/3 of debt is held by domestic investors.
Since banks now account for the largest share, at around 20 percent, the rollover of LTROs would
likely be important for containing interest costs.
Shocks and Stress Tests
6.
The heat map of the main risk shows susceptibility to a negative surprise to growth
and macro fiscal shocks.


Growth shock. Real output growth rates are assumed to be lower by one standard deviation for
two years starting in 2014, resulting in an average growth of -1.3 percent in 2015–16.
Furthermore, for every 1 percentage point decline in growth, inflation declines by 0.25
percentage points. The nominal primary balance improves much more slowly than the baseline,
reaching only 2.3 percent of GDP by 2019. Debt-to-GDP increases rapidly to about 147 percent
during the growth shock and then fails to come down over the projection period. Gross financing
needs also rise significantly.



Interest rate shock. Market concerns about medium-term debt sustainability intensify increasing
spreads by 200 bps. Higher borrowing costs are passed on to the real economy, depressing
growth by 0.4 percent. The government’s interest bill climbs reaching an implicit average interest
rate of almost 5.3 percent by 2019. The debt-to-GDP ratio declines only modestly to 132 percent
in 2019, despite sizeable primary surpluses.



Contingent liability shock. Negative surprises, such as from the financial system, lead to a onetime increase in non-interest expenditure of about 10 percent of banking sector assets. This leads
to a decline in growth for two consecutive years by about 1.2 percent depressing domestic
demand and lowering inflation by 0.3 percent. Primary balance worsens by 12 percent of GDP
in 2015 and by 1.4 percent of GDP from 2016 onwards. Debt rises and stabilizes at a higher level
of 150 percent of GDP. Gross financing needs would remain elevated at around 30 percent of
GDP.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ITALY



Primary balance shock. Reform fatigue weakens the implementation of fiscal adjustment
plans—which are delayed by one year relative to the baseline. The slippage leads to a very slight
increase in risk premiums (30 bps increase for each 1 percent of GDP slippage). The debt-to-GDP
ratio is about 3.5 percentage points higher than the baseline by 2019.



Low inflation and prolonged stagnation. Inflation surprises on the downside given the large
negative output gap and is lower by 1 standard deviation (0.6 pp) from 2015 onwards, rising
from 0.6 percent in 2015 and reaching 1 percent in 2019. Annual GDP growth is 0.5 to
1 percentage points lower than in the baseline and there is a 100 bps increase in interest rates
from 2015–19. This could potentially arise due to slow progress in structural reforms, increase in
contingent liabilities, possibly from the banking sector, and loss of confidence as interest rates
spike. The debt-ratio increases to 145 percent of GDP in 2019 and fails to stabilize over the
projection period.



Policy advice scenario. Under this scenario, additional adjustment of around ½ percent of GDP
is undertaken in 2015 compared to the baseline. This is combined with structural reforms to
rebalance the budget which provides a growth dividend of ¼ percent in 2016 that rises
permanently to 1 percent of GDP in 2019. The higher fiscal surplus allows the interest rate to
decline by around 20 bps. These assumptions allow the debt-ratio to decline firmly to about
117 percent of GDP by 2019 and continue on a declining path.

Background. Italy’s net international investment position (NIIP) has deteriorated by 16 percent of GDP since joining the
Euro area, with net liabilities of 29 percent of GDP (September 2013) as compared with 13 percent at end 2000. 1/
Modest current account surpluses forecast over the medium-term will gradually shrink Italy’s net liability position as a
share of GDP. At 123 percent of GDP, Italy’s external debt is in line with the Euro area as a whole; however the
composition of external debt, of which 40 percent is owed by the government, underscores the vulnerabilities related to
the high level of public sector debt. 2/
Assessment. In light of the current account’s shift into small surplus, overall external sustainability is not a concern;
however, some further strengthening of balance sheet is desirable. Italy is vulnerable to financial contagion given its
large stock of government debt and the large share held by non-residents.
Current
account

Background. Italy’s current account (CA) averaged a deficit of 2 percent of GDP over the past decade, and moved into
balance starting in 2012. In 2013, the current account registered a surplus of 1 percent of GDP. The improvement in the
current account reflects a modest trade surplus starting in 2012 (growing to more than 2 percent in 2013), owing both
to higher exports and subdued imports, while the deficit in incomes and (EU) transfers continued. In terms of saving
and investment, declining investment accounted for about three-fourths of the improvement in the current account,
while increased public saving more than offset lower private saving.
Assessment. With the recent improvement in the current account, the EBA model suggests the cyclically-adjusted level
was very near balance (0.3 percent of GDP) in 2013, essentially matching the EBA-estimated norm implied by mediumterm fundamentals and desirable policy settings. Given the need for stronger growth to reduce the high public debt
and unemployment over the medium term, while improving the external balance sheet, staff assesses a gap of -1.5 to
0 percent of GDP.

Real exchange
rate

Background. Stagnant productivity and rising labor costs have resulted in a gradual appreciation of the real effective
exchange rate (REER) since joining the Euro area, both in absolute terms and relative to the Euro area average. A
comparison of price-based indices suggests misalignment on the order of 0 to 10 percent, with labor-based indicators
showing a much wider gap than other price-based measures.
Assessment. The EBA methodologies provide estimates of REER gaps of +3 percent (overvaluation, from the REER
regression method) to -1 percent (undervaluation, from the CA regression method). On balance, and consistent with
the staff assessment of the CA, a real effective depreciation of 0-5 percent would support further adjustment and
address economic imbalances over the medium-term.

Capital and
financial
accounts:
flows and
policy
measures

Background. Portfolio and other-investment inflows typically have financed the current account deficit, and a modest
net FDI outflow, without much difficulty. Over 2011-12, however, banks had difficulties raising funds in international
markets, resulting in an increased reliance on euro system refinancing. As conditions in the Euro area stabilized starting
in late-2012, TARGET2 liabilities have declined. Foreign investment in portfolio debt securities turned positive in 2013,
following two consecutive years of outflows, led by investment in government securities.

FX
intervention
and reserves
level

Background. The euro has the status of a global reserve currency.

Assessment. Italy remains vulnerable to a loss in market confidence, owing to the large refinancing needs of the
sovereign and banking sectors, and tight credit conditions from financial fragmentation.

Assessment. Reserves held by the euro area are typically low relative to standard metrics, but the currency is free
floating.

Overall Assessment
Overall Assessment:
The external position is broadly consistent
but likely still weaker than suggested by
medium-term fundamentals and desirable
policy settings.
This assessment is supported by Italy’s
weak productivity and competitiveness
indicators. In particular, stronger growth,
consistent with reducing high
unemployment and public debt, while
strengthening the external balance sheet,
would require a modest weakening of the
real effective exchange rate.
Part of the needed adjustment may reflect
Italy’s weak competitive position within the
Euro area, where relative price effects may
be magnified by the existence of a
common currency.
Potential policy responses:
Implementation of structural reforms will
be critical to improving competitiveness
and boosting potential growth. Continued
progress in medium-term fiscal
consolidation will also help close the
competitiveness gap and maintain investor
confidence. Combined, these measures will
support growth and employment over the
medium-term.

Background
Notes

1/ The NFA position is somewhat more negative, at about -34 percent of GDP in 2012, than the NIIP position of about
-28 percent of GDP in that year. While not very negative in relative terms, a stronger NIIP position would help reduce
vulnerabilities to financial contagion.
2/ Total gross external liabilities are about 152 percent of GDP (2012), of which external debt represents about fourthfifths.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
ITALY—STATISTICAL ISSUES APPENDIX
As of July 20, 2014
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is adequate for surveillance. Italy’s economic and financial statistics are comprehensive
and of generally high quality. Data are provided to the Fund in a comprehensive manner (see Table 1). The
authorities regularly publish a full range of economic and financial data, as well as a calendar of dates for the
main statistical releases. Italy is also subject to the statistical requirements of Eurostat and the European
Central Bank (ECB), including the timeliness and reporting standards,) and it has adopted the European System
of Accounts 1995 (ESA95).
National Accounts: Further improvements should be considered regarding changes in inventories in the
quarterly national accounts, which are currently derived as a residual and lumped together with the statistical
discrepancy.
Price Statistics:
Government Finance Statistics:
Monetary and Financial Statistics:
Financial Sector Surveillance: Participates in the IMF’s Coordinated Direct Investment Survey (CDIS),
Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS) and financial soundness indicators (FSIs) databases.
External Sector Statistics: The first transmission of International Investment Position (IIP) data on the basis of
the Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual, 6th edition (BPM6) will take place in
June 2014, as envisaged by the work plan agreed with the ECB and the Eurosystem national central banks.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Italy has subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) since 1996

A data ROSC was

and posts its metadata on the Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB). Italy

disseminated in 2002.

has shown interest in adhering to the SDDS Plus; an STA mission found that Italy
could be among the initial adherents when the SDDS Plus is launched.
Implementing G-20 DGI recommendations: The authorities have already
implemented a good number of the recommendations and work is underway to
implement the remaining ones. Further progress in the near future is likely to be
made on the reporting frequency of Financial Soundness Indicators.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes Article IV Consultation with Italy
On September 12, 2014, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation1 with Italy.
The economy is struggling to emerge from a balance sheet recession. GDP contracted in the first
half of the year but business surveys and resilient exports suggest a gradual increase in economic
activity in coming quarters. Against the background of significant economic slack, inflation fell
well below one percent and unemployment reached 12.3 percent. Sovereign spreads narrowed
but financing conditions remain very tight for the corporate sector (especially for small and
medium enterprises, SMEs) and non-performing loans (NPLs) continue to increase. Growth is
expected to pick up to 1.1 percent in 2015 as credit conditions normalize and the effects of the
easing measures by the European Central Bank (ECB) are felt. Risks are still tilted to the
downside and include geopolitical tensions and the possibility of stagnation and low inflation
Prime Minister Renzi has outlined a bold reform agenda—firm implementation is now essential
to create jobs, increase productivity, and lift potential growth from a low estimate of about ½
percent. The first phase of the labor market reform focused on increasing flexibility at the margin
and future measures will explore a contract with gradually increasing protection and improve
active labor market policies. Reforms in the judicial system and the public administration are in
progress and competition-enhancing reforms are to be legislated soon. Implementing structural
reforms simultaneously would be self-reinforcing and generate significant growth synergies.
The nominal budget deficit is expected to be around 3 percent of GDP this year. In structural
terms, a deficit of 0.8 percent of GDP is expected. Public debt will peak this year at about 136
percent of GDP and is projected to decline thereafter. The passage of the delega fiscale
establishes a framework for simplifying and improving the tax system and will be an important
tool to achieve a growth-friendly fiscal rebalancing.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors noted that the Italian economy has yet to emerge from a prolonged recession
and prospects remain uncertain with downside risks. Unemployment remains high and inflation
has declined further. Meanwhile, tight credit conditions, weak corporate balance sheets, and
deeply-rooted structural rigidities continue to weigh on domestic demand. Directors considered
that the high level of public debt has magnified these challenges.
Against this backdrop, Directors agreed that deep structural changes are needed to unleash Italy’s
growth potential, secure a recovery, and address debt overhang issues. They welcomed the bold
policy agenda set out by the new government. The proposed changes to the labor market, the
judicial system, the public sector, and the electoral law are important steps for supporting future
growth.
Directors stressed the urgency of labor market reforms to reduce duality and increase flexibility,
building on recent gains. They saw the benefits of options such as simplified labor contracts with
gradually increasing protection, and decentralized wage setting to promote firm-level wage
bargaining and better align wages to productivity.
Directors welcomed initiatives to improve the business climate. They emphasized in particular
the importance of judicial reforms, aimed at improving court efficiency and facilitating corporate
restructuring. Directors supported continued efforts to enhance competition, especially in the
retail and service sectors, and to strengthen the anti-corruption legal framework.
Directors agreed that cleaning up banks’ bad loans remains an immediate priority. They
encouraged more provisioning and write-offs, development of a private market for distressed
debt, and an enhanced insolvency regime. Directors supported steps to improve corporate
governance and promote diversification of financing sources through deeper capital markets.
Directors saw a broad strategy to reinvigorate the small- and medium-sized enterprise sector as a
complement to financial sector reforms. They encouraged the authorities to provide restructuring
support for viable but distressed firms, and facilitate a smooth exit for those that are not viable.
Directors noted that steps to strengthen collateral enforcement would help support new
financing.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers

Directors commended the Italian authorities for the remarkable fiscal consolidation over the past
few years. Going forward, they underscored the need for fiscal policy to strike a balance between
securing near-term growth and setting the debt ratio on a downward path over the medium term.
In this regard, they agreed that the priority for growth-friendly adjustment should be to create
space for lowering marginal tax rates through spending savings and lower tax expenditures. At
the same time, Directors considered that, given the environment of low growth, high real interest
rates, and large financing needs, it would be prudent to build up a structural balance buffer once
the recovery firmly takes hold. Directors supported ongoing fiscal reforms, notably the planned
expenditure review, efforts to fight tax evasion, and the intention to introduce a medium-term
expenditure framework.

Statement by Mr. Andrea Montanino, Executive Director for Italy
September 12, 2014
Introduction
The bulk of the 2014 Article IV Report on Italy is dedicated to a set of reforms aimed at
unleashing potential output. In a context where the most significant risks facing the Italian
economy in the past few years have receded – thanks to a sizeable fiscal consolidation, the
resilience of the banking sector, and strengthened European institutions – a Report tilted
towards structural issues is appropriate. As staff notes, structural reforms are the fundamental
component of the authorities’ agenda. This has been the case for several years now, in a
continued effort by the country to overcome all impediments to economic growth. However,
this is a long and demanding process: making reforms requires political support, while
implementing them takes time and unwavering commitment.
While the track record of the reform efforts undertaken since the outbreak of the crisis is
relatively long and consistent, further momentum needs certainly to be gained. Some recent
initiatives approved by the government during the most recent period – which are not
included in the staff Report – go into this direction. Still, the process is far from complete and
will require maintaining a resolute determination, to be extended to the implementation phase
and to the monitoring of the results to ensure their effectiveness. At this juncture, it is
important that economic policies are carefully calibrated to avoid further weakening
economic prospects.
In this broad context, the collaboration between staff and the authorities continued to be
excellent. As always, Fund staff recommendations are highly appreciated and are carefully
considered in order to inform the policy agenda. Overall, there is broad agreement on the
main objectives, priorities, and instruments to be adopted, with some qualifications. In what
follows we elaborate on some of the issues touched upon by the Report, noting a few points
of disagreement and providing evidence about the renewed reforming efforts of the
authorities.
Structural reforms
Judicial
Improving the efficiency of the justice system is a central concern of the Italian authorities.
As staff noted, a number of measures have been adopted over the course of recent years and
some early positive results can now be seen. However, structural bottlenecks remain and
further efforts are in progress. On August 29, 2014 the government presented a new set of
measures which are broadly consistent with staff suggestions and include, among others,
norms to discourage litigations and to enhance mediation in civil justice and to criminalize
false accounting in criminal justice.

2
From a broader perspective, we were somewhat surprised by the emphasis given to
corruption in the public sector in Para. 13 of the Report. The evidence referred to pertains to
perceptions of corruption, which is a different concept and measure from corruption itself.
Besides being challenging, the relevance of such statistics should not be overstated.
Labor market
The reform of fixed-term contracts and of the apprenticeship became law last May making it
easier for firms to hire new workers. On other matters, the work is still in progress and
should be completed in the coming months. The objectives and instruments of the reform are
broadly consistent with staff recommendations, albeit with some differences in emphasis.
With respect to the latter, and in particular to the issue of decentralized wage settings – which
staff suggests that is somehow neglected – we note that a process of erosion of the centrality
of national contracts has been ongoing for several years now. Further improvements are
certainly possible, although staff did not consider that last January social parts agreed upon
an Act on Representation which will help enforceability of industry-wide and company level
agreements. On a more general note, it should be emphasized that a labor market reform was
already undertaken in 2012 (Fornero Reform). Its provisions – which have been largely
implemented – addressed issues related to employment protection, to the duality in the labor
market, and to the design of a universal unemployment benefit system. Based on available
evidence, the first results of these reforms are positive, but the difficult conditions of the
labor market require further reform efforts that the authorities are determined to undertake.
Public Administration
An effective public administration is a pre-requisite for the implementation of structural
reforms. On August 7, 2014 the reform provisions envisaged by the government in June were
adopted by Parliament. Among others, the main measures are aimed at: i) fostering mobility
(voluntary and compulsory) of public sector workers; ii) strengthening caps to salaries of top
civil servants; iii) introducing the possibility for the public administration to unilaterally
terminate labor contracts with its employees under specific circumstances; iv) disallowing
the public administration and enterprises where central or local governments have a stake to
assign consultancy contracts to retired workers. The government is determined to implement
these provisions steadily and to closely monitor their effectiveness.
Legislative system
It has long been argued that the complexity of the Italian legislative process called for
simplification, better coordination among different layers of government, and enhanced
accountability. On August 8, 2014 a step forward was achieved: the Senate approved a draft
constitutional bill to revise the general provision that assigns equal powers to both chambers
of parliament – the House and the Senate – while intervening also on the relations between
central and local governments. The House is now examining the draft bill.

3

Among the measures included in the provision, the following are particularly worth
mentioning: i) only the House will be endowed with full legislative powers except for a few
topics on which the Senate vote will be relevant; ii) the size of the Senate will shrink from
the current 315 to 100 members, which will represent local authorities; iii) Provinces (one of
the local governments layers) will be repealed.; iv) indemnities for the Regions’ Presidents
and for the members of Regional Councils will be capped and the allowances for regional
political groups will be abolished.
Competitiveness
As can be inferred from the evidence provided in the previous paragraphs, the authorities
fully concur with staff that the key instrument to address the competitiveness gap from which
the Italian economy is suffering is the simultaneous pursuit of wide-ranging reforms. In order
to inform the right choice of measures, it is important that the issue be assessed through a
broad set of indicators. As staff correctly emphasized with an enlightening SIP included in
the 2013 Art. IV Report, due to the effects of globalization “labor-cost measures may present
an incomplete picture, and should perhaps be complemented” with other indicators. In
particular, last year staff advocated for a more comprehensive approach, relying to a large
extent on the assessment of export market shares together with other non-price factors. In
view of this, with which my authorities fully agree, it is somehow puzzling to note that this
year staff referred just to labor cost indicators to argue that “…competitiveness has yet to
improve” (Fig. 1, page 7). While improvements are certainly needed, we emphasize that –
when assessed through PPI-based measures – Italian competitiveness has improved by
around 5 percent since 2008. Furthermore, recent econometric analysis shows that, compared
to other measures (including ULCs), PPI-based indicators have a greater power in explaining
Italian export dynamics. Finally, we also observe that, according to staff, “Italy’s share of
global exports increased for the first time since 2007” (page 4). The broad picture is thus
rather complex and we remain convinced that a more comprehensive approach is warranted.
On a closely related issue, and in line with staff, we would like to stress that the recent rise of
real wages was due to the sizeable decrease of inflation, rather than to nominal wage
dynamics. Actually, as shown by some recent empirical research, neither centralized nor
firm-level bargaining have been a source of rigidity for wage adjustment to the economic
cycle. Of course, the role played by the staggered nature of bargaining rounds has also to be
considered. The overall evidence confirms that productivity-enhancing reforms are the right
way to tackle the Italian competitive gap.
Financial sector
Over the course of the recent difficult years Italian banks strengthened significantly their
capital position relying almost exclusively on contributions by private capital. The share of
the public sector has been minimal, reaching only 0.3 per cent of GDP in the first quarter of

4
2013, a level far below those of most of the other European countries. With the recent
repayment of the largest share of the State’s loan to Monte dei Paschi di Siena, the public
contribution has been substantially wiped out.
As staff noted, in Italy banks play a central role in financing the economy. Their business
model – centered on the traditional intermediation of savings, mostly within the country –
allowed them to withstand the impact of the crisis, which originated in foreign markets and
speculative financial products. Benefitting from the highest standards of supervision, the
resilience of the system continued in recent years, despite the heavy toll taken by the effects
of the protracted recession and the sovereign debt crisis. The very sharp contraction of GDP
hit severely the soundness of many firms, increasing their debt-service burden. The
repercussions for banks have been very serious, as shown by the rise of NPLs.
However, despite difficult circumstances, the Italian banking system has been able to absorb
the shocks smoothly. Capital strengthening is proceeding, as is required by the new rules on
bank capital (Basel 3) in force in the European Union since January. Thanks also to the
continued efforts of the supervisory authority, the coverage ratio on NPLs keeps increasing;
it reached 42 percent in 2013 (up from 39 percent in 2012). Regulation on the
appropriateness of provisioning has been enhanced. It is also encouraging to note that the
inflow of new bad debt has been declining since the third quarter of 2013.
Looking forward, further strengthening banks’ capital necessitates increasing profitability, as
pointed out by staff. The supervisor keeps encouraging banks to reduce their operational
costs. In the last few years, progress on rationalization of the branch network and the curbing
of administrative and staff expenses allowed to keep costs constant in proportion to revenues.
We agree that further efforts have to be pursued along these lines, and we know that banks
must reduce the volume of NPLs in order to free up the resources needed to finance the
economy. In this respect, we observe that there is growing interest in these assets on the part
of specialized investors. They are now willing to pay higher prices than in the past, thanks to
the reduction in risk premiums. And banks are prepared to dispose of these loans at lower
prices, as a consequence of the increase in provisioning. A positive contribution should come
also by recent changes in tax treatment of loan losses. Some disposals of NPLs have already
taken place, and others may be well received by national and international investors.
Financing of the economy
In Italy financial conditions are still tight, with hardest credit supply restrictions on smalland medium-sized firms (SMEs). To revive the SMEs sector, the staff Report includes
several proposals that – for the most part – aim at complementing several initiatives already
undertaken by the authorities. While we agree with many of the staff proposals, we do not
concur with staff on the suggestion of “shifting public support schemes away from
guarantees and moratorium for existing firms to financing for new firms”. At a time when
banks are concerned about borrowers’ soundness and prospects, the dearth of credit has been

5
alleviated by the granting of government guarantees, which have the objective of preserving
the flow of funding to firms with good growth opportunities. In this regard, we emphasize
that the forbearance risks implied in these schemes are quite well controlled, as the access to
the measures is precluded to financially distressed firms and the default rate of such schemes
is among the lowest of comparable public guarantee schemes around the world.
We also don’t agree with staff on the alleged fragmentation of the system of credit registries
and bureaus. In fact, the Italian Credit Register ensures a very large coverage – by
international standards – of credit activity by banks and other intermediaries granting credit
(e.g. the size threshold for loans is 30,000 euro). Data covered only by private credit bureaus
are limited to very small loans. From a broader perspective, we welcome staff proposals to
develop further capital markets. This is indeed a crucial issue: bank lending cannot be the
sole source of funds for the productive economy and several steps have been taken in recent
years to address this concern, as also acknowledged by staff.
Fiscal policy
Against the background of the sizeable fiscal consolidation efforts implemented since the
beginning of the crisis, Italy’s fiscal prudence was confirmed in 2013, when the government
continued to keep the deficit below the Maastricht threshold, in line with the official targets.
Looking forward, my authorities remain committed to a prudent and rigorous fiscal policy to
keep public finance on a sustainable path; they also reaffirm that the spending review is a
strategic tool to this aim. As envisaged by the domestic budgetary process, the government
will present shortly by October 1, 2014 the Update to the Economic and Financial Document
of last April, which will provide the updated macro-economic and budgetary projections for
the Italian economy. Given the current juncture – characterized by more muted international
economic perspectives and by the persistent weakness of domestic demand – we need to
avoid the risk of further weakening economic conditions, which would perversely add a
further heavy burden to Italy’s consolidation efforts. For these reasons, we do not concur
with staff recommendations that – under the baseline scenario – additional consolidation is
needed. Furthermore, we also consider that – in the medium term – the target proposed by
staff of a structural surplus of 1 per cent of GDP is not advisable, being well beyond what is
requested by the EU fiscal rules, including the debt rule.
Conclusion
Over the course of the last year, the most pressing risks surrounding the outlook for the
Italian economy have gradually lessened. The very sizeable consolidation efforts pursued
since the outbreak of the crisis have been crucial to achieving this outcome, together with
other important factors. While the authorities are firmly determined to consolidate these
results, the “supply-side” emphasis of the 2014 Art. IV Report is welcome as a framework
towards unleashing the Italian potential output. Indeed, at this juncture the return to a stable

6
and sustainable growth path is an essential complement to the policies aimed at repairing
public and private balance sheets. The growth strategy has to be based on structural reforms
and on measures to foster investments and competitiveness, while pursuing budget
consolidation.
