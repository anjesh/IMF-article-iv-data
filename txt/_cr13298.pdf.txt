KEY ISSUES
Beyond Austerity: Priorities for Reviving Growth
A difficult recovery. After two years of recession, the economy is showing signs of
stabilizing, but continues to face strong headwinds from tight credit conditions. A
modest recovery is expected to take hold later this year, led by exports.
Declining trend growth. The euro area crisis hit Italy hard, but the origins of Italy’s low
growth pre-date the crisis and stem from its stagnant productivity, difficult business
environment, and an over-leveraged public sector. In the absence of deeper structural
reforms, medium-term growth is projected to remain low.
Risks and spillovers. Italy is vulnerable to a renewal of euro area tension and risks from
domestic policy slippages, stalling of structural reforms, and banking distress that could
undermine confidence. In view of its central role in the global trade and financial system,
steps by Italy to reduce fiscal vulnerabilities and boost growth would carry important
spillover benefits for the currency union and for global financial stability.
Policies to revive growth and tackle structural problems. A comprehensive policy
response is needed to reduce vulnerabilities and sustain a robust recovery:
 Improving the business environment and creating jobs. The government has
taken steps to liberalize services, open the energy sector, and improve the labor market,
but more is needed to boost productivity and raise Italy’s low employment rate.
 Reducing public debt and rebalancing adjustment. Italy is set to reach its target of
a structural balance this year. To support growth, a rebalancing of fiscal adjustment
towards spending cuts and lower taxes is needed. Once the recovery is underway,
building a buffer under the structural balance rule would bring down debt more quickly
and reduce vulnerabilities.
 Strengthening banks’ balance sheets and lending. Banks have improved their
capital positions, but continue to suffer from weak asset quality and profitability.
To strengthen lending, banks should build adequate capital and liquidity buffers and
accelerate the repair of their balance sheet. Measures to address financial fragmentation
at the European level would ease credit conditions and funding concerns.

BACKGROUND: A DIFFICULT RECOVERY
1.
After nearly two years of recession, the economy is showing signs of stabilizing.
GDP contracted by 2.4 percent in 2012, and at a similar annualized rate in the first half of 2013.
The contraction was led by sharp falls in domestic demand, reflecting tight credit conditions, the
sizeable fiscal adjustment, and depressed confidence. Recent data show some signs of
stabilization: business and household confidence is improving and export orders have picked up,
but spending and employment remain weak. The unemployment rate is at post-war highs of
12 percent, with youth unemployment nearing 40 percent.
2.
Sovereign financing pressures have eased significantly. Following significant fiscal
adjustment and the announcement of the Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT) framework in
August 2012, sovereign yields have fallen considerably. Volatility and yields picked up earlier this
year following the elections in Italy and global reaction to Federal Reserve policy, but proved
temporary, and have returned roughly to levels seen at the end of last year.

3.
Credit conditions, however, remain tight
and have depressed private spending. Since 2010,
financial fragmentation has driven Italian lending rates
up by nearly 150 bps, far exceeding those in the core
countries and elsewhere. Compared to the sharp
declines in sovereign yields since the OMT
announcement, Italian lending rates have fallen only
slightly. Staff analysis indicates that higher lending
rates have tightened monetary conditions, negating
the impact of ECB rate cuts and the euro’s
depreciation, and were a major factor behind the deep
recession (Box 1).

4.
The lengthy recession and financial fragmentation have taken a heavy toll on
Italian banks. The ratio of nonperforming loans has almost tripled since 2007, while the outflows
of nonresident deposits and limited access to wholesale financing have raised the cost of
funding. Italian banks have responded by keeping lending rates high and reducing loans to the
corporate sector (by 4 percent in June, y/y). While weak demand was the main factor driving
deleveraging last year, lending survey data suggest that supply constraints are becoming more
important.
5.
Weak demand has also contributed to the narrowing of external imbalances. The
current account deficit has declined from 3½ percent of GDP in 2010 to near zero in the first half
of 2013, reflecting mainly a collapse in imports and steady exports. Italy’s net international
investment position is modest at -24 percent of GDP and has been broadly stable. Private-sector
capital inflows have increased over the past few quarters, as overseas investors have resumed
purchases of Italian sovereign bonds.

Box 1. Italy―The Impact of Tight Credit Conditions on Growth
Despite cuts in the policy rate, monetary conditions in 2013 have eased only marginally compared
to 2009.1 Over the period, the spread between the Italian lending and the policy rate has increased by nearly
160 bps. The tightening from higher real lending rates has largely offset the 4 percent real effective
depreciation, leaving monetary conditions only marginally looser. In contrast, the MCI for Germany has
declined by more over the period, led by falling lending rates.

1/ Loan supply and demand are estimated as linear
functions of the indicators of supply and demand
conditions obtained from the bank lending survey,

An analysis based on bank lending surveys suggests that supply factors are becoming more
important in driving credit developments. An approach that uses bank surveys on credit demand and
lending standards as proxies for unobserved demand and supply (Zoli, 2013) finds that after the LTRO
in 2012, demand for funds fell well short of supply. However since late 2012, supply factors are becoming
more important and, along with weak demand, have been driving deleveraging. According to the surveys,
expectations of weak growth have been an important factor constraining supply.
VAR analysis suggests that tight credit conditions are a key factor in explaining the depth of the
recession. We estimate a VAR over the period 2003Q1–2012Q4 that includes four lags of GDP growth,
inflation, real interest rate on new bank loans, real credit growth, and changes in credit standards to
enterprises. Generalized impulse responses find the impact of credit shocks on growth in Italy to be
statistically significant and sizeable. In annualized terms, a 1.2 percent contraction in credit reduces growth
by 0.68 percentage points. A one standard deviation exogenous tightening in lending standards (roughly
one third the tightening that took place after the sovereign shock in late 2011) lowers growth by
1.2 percentage points. Since the VAR tends to overestimate GDP contractions out-of-sample, the magnitude
of the responses should be interpreted with caution and attention should be paid to the lower bound of the
confidence intervals.
1

A Monetary Conditions Index (MCI) is defined as a weighted average of the interest rate and the exchange rate:
, where r is the real lending rate to non-financial corporations and q is the log of the CPI-based
REER. The reference period is 2009Q2. The
ratio represents the exchange rate depreciation needed to offset the effects of
100bps increase in interest rates. Here, the ratio is set to 2.9 following Dornbusch et al. (1998) who estimated the parameters for
Italy. Higher ratios as estimated by Peeters (1998) generate a smaller impact.

6.
The coalition government that took office in April is moving forward on the reform
agenda, but faces political constraints. The government is led by Prime Minister Letta from the
Democratic Party, and includes representatives from the center-right and Mr. Monti’s Civic
Choice parties, as well as technocratic members. In June, the government announced further
measures to boost growth and improve the labor market, in particular for the youth. While the
government maintains support in the parliament, tensions between the coalition partners are
apparent and represent a key risk to the economic outlook.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
A. From Recession to Recovery
7.
A modest recovery is expected to start in late 2013, supported by net exports. After
sharp declines in previous years, domestic demand is expected to recover slowly in the face of
stiff headwinds from tight credit conditions. On this basis, growth is projected at -1.8 percent this
year, before rising to 0.7 percent next year. The main factors underlying the forecast are:


Easing fiscal drag. The pace of consolidation in structural
terms will slow from 2¾ percent of GDP in 2012 to
1 percent of GDP this year and close to zero in 2014. The
arrears clearance program (€40 billion or 2½ percent of
GDP) is estimated to contribute 0.4 percentage points to
growth, mainly in 2014. After taking into account the
arrears payment, the fiscal stance is projected to be
1
broadly neutral for this year and next.



Steady exports. A weak recovery in the euro area and
slower growth in key emerging markets are expected to
keep export growth modest. Weak domestic demand and
imports imply further positive contributions of net exports
to growth.



Tight credit conditions. However, tighter lending standards since end-2011 are expected to
persist and limit the pass-through of lower sovereign yields to lending rates, holding back
growth.

That is, contractionary fiscal policy.
2/ Change in structural primary balance.
3/ Including arrears.

The arrears payments are treated as a one-off fiscal operation and excluded from the structural balance
estimates. The estimated growth impact assumes that half are cleared in 2013, and the rest in 2014. Around ¼ of
the €40 billion goes to banks to redeem factored debt with a minimal impact on activity. For the remainder paid
to firms, staff assumes a multiplier of 0.5. Given the lags in spending, most of the growth impact is expected to
take place in 2014.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ITALY

8.
Unemployment is expected to peak at around 12½ percent in 2013 and decline
gradually as the recovery takes hold. The slow recovery and hysteresis effects, however, will
leave the unemployment rate above pre-crisis levels over the forecast horizon.
9.
The large output gap is projected to keep inflation below the euro area average.
HICP inflation declined to 1.1 percent in July (y/y), reflecting mainly the pass through of VAT rate
and indirect tax hikes. Core inflation (excluding energy and seasonal food) was 1.0 percent (y/y)
and is expected to remain low, consistent with the large output gap. High unemployment and
weak aggregate demand are likely to keep wage inflation moderate.

B. Weak Medium-Term Growth Prospects without Reforms
10.
In the absence of deeper structural reforms, medium-term growth is projected to
remain low. The euro area crisis hit Italy hard, but the origins of Italy’s low growth pre-date the
crisis and stem from its stagnant productivity, difficult

The IMF’s External Balance Assessment (EBA) for 2012 and other similar exchange-rate analysis suggest that the
potential degree of misalignment is more modest—EBA estimates imply that the REER is broadly in line with
fundamentals, whereas CGER estimates suggest that the exchange rate may be overvalued by around 8 percent.

share of world exports has generally moved in parallel with its European peers, but weak
productivity has pushed up relative unit labor costs and placed Italian exporters at a growing
disadvantage, particularly vis-à-vis other countries that have adjusted sharply in recent years. 3
Taking into account a broad range of indicators, staff considers that a real effective depreciation
of not more than 10 percent would be appropriate to restore competitiveness.4

C. Managing Risks and Global Spillovers
12.
Risks to the outlook are tilted to the downside, stemming mainly from potential
policy slippages and banking distress. As highlighted in the Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM),
Italy remains vulnerable to financial contagion due to the high level of sovereign debt and
financing needs (€400 billion annually). Policy slippages, including at the European level, could
undermine confidence in the sovereign, pushing Italy into a negative environment of rising
sovereign spreads, tighter bank funding, and a worsening economy. In a prolonged recession,
analysis for the FSAP shows that rising corporate bankruptcies and falling property prices would
further increase NPLs, especially for weak,

13.
Strong policies, both in Italy and at the euro area level, to maintain credibility and
confidence will be crucial for mitigating spillover risks. The appropriate policy response
would depend on the shock and market reactions, but in general should aim to restore
confidence by reaffirming the structural balance target, including over the medium-term,
enhancing the commitment to structural reforms, and strengthening the resilience of the banks.
In this context, given the uncertainty surrounding these estimates, the 2013 Pilot External Sector Report notes
that the exchange rate may be overvalued by 0-10 percent, consistent with a current-account gap of 0-2 percent
of GDP.
3

See Selected Issues Paper “Italy: Innovation, Productivity and Competitiveness.”

IMF staff estimates suggest that product and labor market reforms that bring Italy close to OECD best practices
could increase the level of GDP by about 6 percent over the medium term and contribute significantly to closing
Italy’s competitiveness gap (see Lusinyan and Muir, “Assessing the Macroeconomic Impact of Structural Reforms:
The Case of Italy”, IMF WP/13, 22, January 2013). These reforms are not incorporated in staff’s medium-term
baseline growth projections.

In the event that banking stress spills over to the sovereign, a euro area backstop would be
needed to break the sovereign–banking link and support the needed adjustment and reform
efforts.
14.
Spillover analysis indicates that a shock from Italy could have a marked impact on
Europe and beyond through trade and financial channels. Bilateral links are particularly
pronounced vis-a-vis Germany and France; but more broadly, Italy is the world’s fifth largest
manufacturer, represents 17 percent of euro area GDP, and has the world’s third largest bond
market. Given its central role in the global trading and financial system, a significant idiosyncratic
shock in Italy could generate regional or global spillovers that would likely be larger than
suggested by direct exposures alone (Box 2). In this context, the authorities’ ongoing efforts to
reduce fiscal vulnerabilities and support growth will have benefits beyond Italy—contributing to
a more robust recovery in Europe, strengthening the currency union, and supporting global
financial stability.

D. Authorities’ Views
15.
The authorities shared staff’s view on the headwinds from tight credit, but placed
more emphasis on stimulus measures in helping the recovery. They remain concerned about
the tight credit conditions for firms, as banks continue to deleverage, keep rates high, or demand
more collateral for loans. They saw recent policy actions to pay arrears and accelerate
infrastructure spending as playing an important role in supporting the recovery. In particular, the
arrears payments, which have helped avert further corporate defaults and unblock credit markets,
could contribute more than 0.6 percentage points to growth in 2013-14. This is also borne out in
Bank of Italy (BOI) surveys in June which still highlight the difficulties in accessing credit but point
to an improvement in investment expectations in the second half of the year. On this basis, the
BOI’s July Economic Bulletin forecasts GDP to decline by 1.9 percent this year before recovering
to 0.7 percent in 2014.
16.
Domestic risks have eased as public support for the government coalition has
grown and on account of recent steps to strengthen the banking system. Instead, the
authorities saw greater external risks to the outlook, arising from weaker growth in emerging
markets, renewed euro area tensions, and higher interest rates. On the inward spillovers, Italy
remains vulnerable given its high level of public debt, though the introduction of the OMT
framework, progress on the banking union, and an improved fiscal outlook have reduced these
vulnerabilities. Foreign banks have also reduced significantly their exposures to the Italian
sovereign and banks, while Italy’s export mix has diversified into more non-euro area
destinations. As cross-border vulnerabilities have been reduced, Italy is also less likely to be the
source of disruptive shocks flowing outward. To mitigate these risks, the authorities saw
achieving the fiscal objectives and fully implementing reforms as crucial for maintaining
confidence.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ITALY

Box 2. Assessing Italy’s Inward and Outward Spillovers
Italy has sizeable links with other euro area countries, and remains vulnerable to inward spillovers from
the region (Figure 6). On trade, about 41 percent of Italy’s total exports are still directed to the euro area.
Financially, the direct exposure of Italian banks to the euro area is also considerable (30 percent of GDP), with
the largest exposure to Germany and Austria. Bank funding is similarly concentrated, with most interbank loans
coming from Europe (4¼ percent of GDP) and primarily from Germany and France (3 percent combined). In
addition, Italy has guaranteed funding to Greece, Ireland, and Portugal through the Greek loan facility and the
EFSF, amounting to around €37 billion (2.4 percent of GDP).
Italy’s central role also suggests that outward spillovers, especially to Central, Eastern, and Southeastern
Europe (CESEE), could be significant. Italy is the second largest bank creditor, after Austria, to the CEE. Most
of these exposures are funded locally, rather than from Italy, but distress among Italian parent banks could
nonetheless have regional consequences by prompting a withdrawal of local deposits. Moreover,
interconnectedness analysis suggests that Italy is also a global “gatekeeper,” acting as a propagator or a
dampener of trade and financial shocks, depending on the country’s vulnerabilities and policy response. Given
Italy’s relatively central global role, a large disturbance in Italy would represent a significant regional or global
shock for other countries, and might have a larger impact than suggested by direct exposures alone.
Model simulations and empirical analysis confirm the key role of financial channels in propagating
potential shocks from Italy. Staff simulations using the G35-S model provide a quantitative guide to the
transmission of shocks originating in Italy. The general pattern of outward spillovers can be summarized by
spillover coefficients to each other country, similar to the concept of a multiplier. Spillovers from
macroeconomic shocks (such as a demand or policy disturbance) are most evident in central Europe, Austria
and Switzerland, but seem relatively modest. However, the potential spillovers from a financial shock—such as
a sudden increase in Italian sovereign spreads—are markedly
higher. For example, an increase in spreads (of around
500 bps) would not only reduce Italian demand, thereby
depressing Italian imports, but also impact foreign debt
holders. Moreover, this impact would be further amplified to
the extent that the prices of other assets, both within Italy and
abroad, tend to move together. The net effect could be to
lower output by up to ½ percent in countries such as Austria,

wage declines in some of Italy’s key competitors has been mainly due to labor tax cuts.
Nevertheless, with the wage share in gross output falling in Italy and elsewhere, broader pricebased indicators, such as for producer prices, may be more indicative and for Italy, show a more
modest competitiveness gap. The authorities viewed the recent improvement in the current
account as structural, and expect the current account to remain broadly balanced over the
medium term. They agreed that Italy’s declining competitiveness is consistent with a modest
overvaluation of the real effective exchange rate that could be addressed through structural
reform.

18.
The authorities still saw potential growth returning to around pre-crisis levels of
1 percent by the end of the decade. They agreed, however, that further structural reforms are
needed to achieve this and saw significant potential gains. For example, they estimate that the
package of reforms approved last year, if implemented fully, could increase GDP 3.9 percentage
points by 2020 and 6.9 percent in the long term. Should lending rates, however, remain elevated
and hold back investment, potential growth could be lower.

POLICY PRIORITIES FOR REVIVING GROWTH
Reviving growth will require comprehensive reforms to improve the business environment,
reduce fiscal vulnerabilities, and strengthen the banking system. The difficult reforms taken
over the past years were necessary to restore confidence and bring Italy back from the brink. But
growth prospects remain weak, unemployment is high, and market sentiment is still fragile,
underscoring that the task is far from complete. Accelerating the momentum for reforms will be
essential to strengthen confidence and secure a robust recovery. Europe will also need to play its
part with actions to reverse financial fragmentation and strengthen further the currency union.

The economy’s weak recovery since the crisis highlights its lack of flexibility in
responding to shocks and changes in global demand. High entry barriers and regulatory
hurdles, especially in services, inefficient public services, and the prohibitive cost of electricity
(about 50 percent greater than the euro area average) have eroded Italy’s productivity and
competitiveness. The lengthy and inefficient

Priority should be given to completing the implementation of product market
reforms and improving public services. Progress has been made in liberalizing some
professional services and opening the gas sector, amid signs that greater competition is pushing
down energy prices. However, implementation in other areas has lagged. Compared to other

OECD countries, the gap between regulations on paper and perceptions of market efficiency in
Italy is wide, highlighting the need for further concrete action.


Product and service markets. Steps to appoint transport regulators, enhance competition in
the electricity sector, and reform the legal profession should be completed quickly to reduce
markups and boost productivity. At the euro area level, moves to strengthen the common
market, such as the Services Directive, would enhance the cross-border benefits of reforms.



Public services. Accelerating the privatization agenda, especially at the local level, and
completing the spending reviews to enhance public administration would improve the
efficiency and costs of public services.

21.
More is needed to raise Italy’s low employment and better match wages to
productivity. Italy’s employment rate for women and the youth is well below the euro area
average and represents an underutilized source of growth. Staff estimates that reforms that close
half the employment gap with the rest of Europe (some 4½ percentage points) could lift the level
of GDP by as much as 2½ percent by 20185 and should aim to:

abuse, the development and use of performance indicators for all courts, and a further alignment
of the appeal systems with international practice to reduce excessive appeals.6

23.
Efforts to combat corruption should be stepped up. Although it is difficult to measure,
Italy fares poorly in global surveys on corruption perceptions, and the government has made
fighting corruption a policy priority. The 2012 anti-corruption law took important steps in
criminalizing corruption in the private sector and emphasizing prevention. Further strengthening
of anti-money laundering (AML) tools, including by criminalizing self-laundering and reinforcing
due diligence regarding persons entrusted with prominent public functions, would better equip
the authorities in their fight against corruption.

Authorities’ Views
24.
The authorities stressed their continued commitment to the reform agenda. They
highlighted the growth package passed in June that included public infrastructure investments
and funds to promote employment, especially among the youth and have recently issued a
report to Parliament on deregulation and simplification. On energy, they pointed to progress in
liberalizing the gas market as having lowered wholesale prices by nearly 25 percent. However,
further declines will be limited by Italy’s heavy dependence on more expensive natural gas and
the need for further infrastructure investment in distribution. The Cabinet’s appointment of a
management team to lead the transport authorities is waiting for parliamentary approval.
25.
The authorities plan to push forward with privatization as part of their efforts to
reduce debt and improve the efficiency of public services. The government has pledged to
sell state-owned assets, mainly real estate, amounting to around 5 percent of GDP through 2017.

ITALY

While privatization at the central government level has moved forward, most recently with the
separation of gas distribution and production, progress at the local level has been slow. The
government aims to announce a more detailed privatization plan in the fall that will include both
state-controlled companies and property.
26.
Labor reforms passed last year clarified the conditions for dismissals and expanded
apprenticeships, but any impact on hiring was likely overshadowed by the collapse in
demand. Despite the incentives for apprenticeships as a bridge to regular contracts, firms still
face the legal risk of reinstatement for unfair dismissals and saw the cost of conversion as too
large. While a more flexible, single labor contract could help bridge this gap, it would not resolve
the larger issue of existing contracts. Rather than further legal changes, the authorities placed
greater emphasis on effectively implementing the new rules and improving the judicial review for
disputes to reduce hiring uncertainty.
27.
In addition to tackling youth unemployment, there is a need to look more broadly
at labor market and demand policies to strengthen employment. Some observers noted that
although youth unemployment is a serious issue, much of the increase in unemployment in
recent years has been for the working age and elderly who now face greater difficulties in reentering the labor force. To expand participation, the authorities agreed on the need to improve
the coordination of ALMPs where unemployment benefits are paid at the national level, but

28.
Important judicial reforms are underway
to improve the business environment. The authorities have reintroduced compulsory
mediation after a constitutional challenge, reduced the backlog of pending cases, shifted to
more online court procedures, and raised some court fees which, compared to other countries in
Europe, still cover only a modest portion of court costs. Nevertheless, their efforts continue to
face stiff resistance from lawyer groups against limiting access to the justice system. Looking
ahead, the authorities are preparing a comprehensive review of the civil procedure code to
reform the appeal system and facilitate more settlement outside the courts.
29.
The authorities agreed that greater use of AML tools would increase the
effectiveness of their efforts. They saw the cost of corruption to the economy to be a
significant drag on business and are taking steps to implement the anti-corruption law’s
preventative framework and review customer due diligence measures.

Despite the significant adjustment, the
public debt ratio continues to rise. The public
debt-to-GDP ratio reached 127 percent in 2012 and
is projected to rise another 5 percentage points this
year due to the weak economy and one-off factors
related to the public arrears clearance and higher
ESM contributions. Although the debt ratio is
projected to decline after 2014, the debt outlook
and financing needs remain vulnerable to a variety
of macro-economic shocks, including slower growth
or market distress (see Debt Sustainability Analysis
in the Annex).

Sovereign financing pressures have subsided, partly reflecting the fiscal adjustment
and improved sentiment towards the euro area. Treasury debt auctions have seen renewed
interest from long-term, institutional investors, both domestic and foreign. After a sharp decline
in 2011–12, the foreign ownership of Italian government bonds has held steady at around
33 percent. Demand has been particularly strong among retail investors for longer-dated bonds,
helping to keep the maturity of public debt at around 7 years. Nevertheless, given the high level
of public debt, sovereign funding needs will remain high, with the amount to be rolled over
annually amounting to around €400 billion (25 percent of GDP) during 2014–15.

7

This includes as yet unidentified measures to finance the revenue shortfall (to be announced in the 2014
budget), potentially around ¼ percent of GDP, from the proposed abolition of the property tax on primary
residences starting in 2014.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

ITALY

Policy Issues and Staff Views
33.
The structural balance target for this year is appropriate. Achieving one the highest
primary surpluses in the euro area last year was a key factor in strengthening policy credibility
and confidence. Targeting a structural balance this year will preserve Italy’s hard-won fiscal gains,
while allowing fiscal policy to remain flexible to the economic cycle.
34.
Recent fiscal policy changes have been mixed. Effective implementation of the
government’s arrears payments could significantly ease firms’ credit constraints, without
affecting the underlying fiscal stance. The renewed efforts to legislate the Delega Fiscale which
aims to improve the structure and efficiency of the tax system are also welcome. Staff also
supported finding savings to substitute the increase in the top VAT rate, which is now postponed
till October. However, the proposal at end-August to repeal the property tax on primary
residences (and introduce a new local services tax) could erode an important tax base,
compromise the fiscal targets, and does little to support medium-term growth. To avoid
weakening the fiscal stance, it will be important to identify measures in the budget to offset the
revenue shortfall. Progress in privatization, especially at the local level, has been slow, and
should be accelerated.
35.
Rebalancing of fiscal adjustment is urgently needed to support growth. With the tax
burden in Italy among the highest in the OECD at 44 percent of GDP, more needs to be done to
support the economy by lowering capital and labor taxation financed with cuts in unproductive
current spending and tax expenditures. Additional savings could also be used to raise public
investment. In staff’s estimates, such a package (Box 3) could lift the level of GDP by around
½ percent over 2 years by shifting resources to higher multiplier areas and could include:


Spending reviews. Starting in 2014, a bottom-up spending review covering all levels of
government should focus on improving the efficiency of public spending and finding
additional savings to lower taxes. This should build on past efforts to control the public
sector wage bill, health costs, and local government spending.



Broadening the tax base. The spending reviews should be undertaken jointly with a
systematic review of tax expenditures which, estimated at 8 percent of GDP, are high by
international standards. The new local services tax should also cover primary residences for
equity and efficiency reasons, and the review of cadastral values accelerated to ensure
fairness. Consideration could also be given to raising the inheritance tax to generate savings
and make the tax system more progressive.



Lower marginal tax rates on labor and capital. Savings from cutting expenditures and
broadening the tax base would help achieve the government’s objective of reducing the high
tax on labor (4 percentage points of GDP higher than the euro area average) to boost
employment and raising the allowance for corporate equity returns (ACE) to spur investment.

Box 3. Rebalancing Taxes to Support Growth1
Evidence suggests that property and consumption taxation are more growth-friendly than direct
taxes. A growth-enhancing tax reform would shift part of the revenue base from labor and capital income to
consumption, immovable property and other forms of wealth whose taxation is less distortionary.
Taxation of labor and capital income remains high in Italy, weighing on employment and growth. Italy
in 2011 had the 4th highest capital taxes among EU27

often a poor way of pursuing policy objectives and create distortions. Instead, tax expenditures, in
particular the VAT reduced rates and exemptions and those benefiting specific sectors and regions,
should be reviewed regularly as part of a broader strategy for government support. Simplifying the tax
system would reduce administration and compliance costs and opportunities for avoidance.



Raising wealth taxation. Bringing the cadastral values closer to market values would improve the
fairness of the property tax system and substantially increase the tax base. Revenue gains could be
partly used to cut property tax rates, and reduce distortionary transaction taxes on real estate.
Strengthening the inheritance tax, which at 0.03 percent of GDP is very low due to generous tax rates
and allowances, could also generate revenue for other more growth-friendly tax cuts on labor and
capital, while allowing the tax system to become more progressive.

In light of the revenue uncertainties from broadening the tax base and introducing wealth taxes, the
package should be carefully costed and sequenced to ensure budget neutrality.

Stepping up efforts to combat tax evasion would also raise revenue and more fairly
distribute the tax burden. The government has conducted more risk-based tax audits and
lowered the thresholds for cash transactions. More can be done, including by strengthening and
making greater use of AML tools mentioned earlier, broadening the scope of false accounting
offenses, and providing the revenue authority with access to suspicious transaction reports
related to tax crimes.
37.
Vulnerabilities from the high public debt underscore the importance of building a
primary surplus buffer over the medium term to support growth. Targeting a more
ambitious surplus than prescribed by the fiscal rule would provide insurance against the risk of
an economic shock to the debt profile. After the recovery is firmly underway, the authorities
should consider gradually over the medium raising the structural target to a surplus of 1 percent
of GDP to bring down the debt ratio more quickly. This will help ensure that the debt ratio
remains on a sustainable path, even in the face of a negative shock, and more broadly contribute
to global stability in sovereign bond markets.
38.
Stronger budget institutions will enhance the credibility of the fiscal anchor and
improve the efficiency of expenditure. To achieve the fiscal objectives, binding multi-year
expenditure ceilings should be used to guide budget planning by ministries and sub-national

governments. The bill establishing the Parliamentary Budget Office (PBO) in January 2014 is
broadly in line with international best practice. The selection of qualified board members and the
integration of the PBO’s role in the budget cycle will be critical to underscoring its independence
and effectiveness.

Authorities’ Views
39.
The authorities viewed the 3 percent of GDP nominal deficit as important for
bolstering their policy credibility. They agree in principle on targeting a structural balance—
consistent with their Medium-Term Objective and the new fiscal rule—to allow for automatic
flexibility to the economic cycle. However, should the outlook deteriorate, they would put priority
on maintaining their fiscal commitments, both to lock in their hard-won fiscal credibility and to
create space next year for more investment spending under the EU framework. They saw in the
near term a greater role for clearing public arrears and accelerating infrastructure spending to
support growth.
40.
Over the medium term, any savings above the structural balance target should be
used to lower the tax burden. The authorities saw that maintaining a structural balance in line
with the fiscal rule would set the debt ratio on an appropriate downward path and comply with
the EU debt requirements. Rather than targeting a higher surplus over the medium term, they
favored using any savings to reduce the high tax burden to support growth. To bring down debt
in the near term, they emphasized privatization receipts, which they estimate at up to 5 percent
of GDP over the next five years, and aim to accelerate plans in this area.
41.
The authorities agree with need to rebalance the budget toward lower spending
and taxes, but face near-term constraints. Following large spending cuts in recent years, the
authorities saw limited scope to do more quickly without undermining key public services—they
pointed to the 2 percent drop in primary

Italy has made significant progress in strengthening fiscal institutions. Since 2010,
the authorities have begun producing an indicative medium-term budget framework, enacted
legislation to create a fiscal council, and initiated various reforms to unify budget legislations and
reduce special funds. On the fiscal council, they plan to follow an open selection process for the
board members of the PBO. They concurred that the budget process needs to be simplified
further and aligned with EU requirements under the fiscal governance framework, e.g. by
changing the timeline on budget decisions, and are considering further steps to strengthen the
fiscal rule, including through top-down spending ceilings.

C. Banking Sector—Strengthening Balance Sheets to Revive Lending
43.
Italian banks continue to rely heavily on Eurosystem support. Italian banks have
repaid little of their Eurosystem borrowing (€255 billion as of June). Household and corporate
deposits continue to increase, but access to wholesale term funding remains tight. The FSAP
stress test finds that with Eurosystem support, Italian banks can easily absorb a liquidity shock
with their substantial collateral (more than €300 billion), leaving deposit flight as the main
liquidity risk. However, Italian banks still face a sizeable funding gap (estimated at 12 percent of
total liabilities) with the expiry of the LTRO next year and the phasing out in March 2015 of
government guaranteed bonds as ECB-eligible collateral.

and remain a source of bank vulnerability and a
drag on profits (Box 4). Indeed, firm-level analysis
of corporate debt highlights about 30 percent of Italian firms (accounting for nearly 50 percent
of corporate debt) as vulnerable to the weak economy and concentrated mainly in the SME and
construction sectors (Annex II).8

A “vulnerable” firm is classified as having an interest coverage rate (gross operating income to interest
payments) of less than two (see Annex II). The forthcoming GFSR, which contains further analysis of corporate
debt under alternative stress scenarios, also points to significant vulnerabilities in the corporate sector and their
implications for bank asset quality.

Box 4. Addressing the NPL Problem in Italy
High NPLs represent a growing risk to bank profitability and soundness. Since 2007, NPLs have
outpaced the buildup of loan loss provisions and core
Tier 1 capital and now exceed capital buffers and
provisions. This however, does not include collateral

including through forward-looking, comprehensive asset
quality reviews and conservative valuation of real estate collateral, would ensure that banks face the proper
incentives to write-off or dispose of bad loans. Aligning the tax deductibility of loan loss provisioning and
write-offs to international levels could accelerate disposals. Staff estimates that allowing for full deductibility
of new loan loss provisions would cost around €3 billion (0.2 percent of GDP) in tax revenue. The market for
distressed assets, which in the mid-1990s was active in purchasing NPLs from banks, could be expanded to
facilitate NPL disposals and restructuring. Such a market has been used effectively in other countries to not
only dispose of bad assets, but also draw in outside financing and expertise, including from overseas, to help
rehabilitate distressed borrowers. The large pricing gap between banks and distressed debt investors (10-25
percent depending on the loan category) remains an obstacle, but has started to narrow, reflecting in part
recent actions by the BOI to strengthen provisioning.

vulnerable to further distress. In such a scenario,
13–20 banks accounting for a quarter to one-third of the banking system would fall below the
Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) and Tier 1 minima, respectively as of 2015, by €6-14 billion
in aggregate (0.4-0.9 percent of GDP).9 This amount would be larger if a higher capital ratio
target were used or if banks were to reclassify loans or raise provisioning rates under the BOI
inspections or the forthcoming ECB/EBA asset quality review (AQR).

Policy Issues and Staff Views
46.
Accelerating write-offs of bad loans would strengthen confidence in Italian banks
and ensure they play a supportive role in the recovery. The high stock of NPLs is due both to
an increase in flows and the slow pace of write-offs (6 years on average). Slow write-offs reflect
several factors, including tax disincentives against provisioning, banks’ heavy reliance on real
estate collateral (which reduces the need for cash provisioning), the lengthy judicial process
(3 years to foreclose on collateral estate and more than 7 years to complete a bankruptcy), and
the limited market for distressed assets. Policies to assist banks in developing strategies for
selling, disposing, or writing down impaired loans should look to:


Enhance provisioning / write-offs. The BOI inspections of 20 banking groups last autumn have
arrested the decline in provisioning coverage since the crisis. Expanding the BOI inspections
to cover more impaired and performing loans as well as smaller banks would strengthen
provisioning further. This will also help banks be prepared for the forthcoming ECB/EBA AQR
and stress tests. Publishing the general findings of the inspections, including guidance on
provisioning, would encourage banks to converge to best practices and enhance market
confidence. As the FSAP notes, ensuring a minimum level of harmonization and

9

In terms of the breakdown, banks influenced by foundations and cooperative banks account for more than
three-quarters of the total shortfall for the system as a whole in the “adverse” scenario. See accompanying
Financial Sector Stability Assessment report for a fuller interpretation of the stress test results.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

27

ITALY

strengthening prudential considerations in write-off practices could also accelerate NPL
disposal (see Table 5 for a summary of the FSAP’s recommendations).


Increase tax deductibility of loan losses. Raising the tax deductibility cap on existing loan loss
provisions (currently 0.3 percent of total loans), while allowing for full deductibility of new
ones, would encourage more provisioning and lift bank earnings.



Expedite the judicial process. Expanding the use of specialized insolvency courts beyond Milan
could reduce the time in insolvency, while greater reliance on on-line court filings and
decisions could accelerate the collateral foreclosure process. Introducing best practice
guidelines on workouts would encourage more out-of-court restructuring.

47.
Ensuring adequate capital and liquidity buffers would strengthen bank lending.
Targeted action to strengthen capital buffers where needed would strengthen Italian banks’
resilience and lending capacity, and prepare for the forthcoming ECB/EBA AQR. At the euro area
level, extending a new LTRO of sufficient tenor would help reduce uncertainty surrounding Italian
banks’ funding gap. At the same time, banks should be encouraged to prepare for changes in
ECB collateral rules on government guaranteed bonds and a gradual exit from Eurosystem
support.
48.
Public capital support for problem banks should attach stringent conditionality. As
noted by the FSAP, and in accordance with new EU State Aid rules, state recapitalization should
be conditional on the attribution of losses to shareholders and junior debt-holders, and
mitigation of moral hazard, such as by replacing the Board and senior managers and restricting
dividends to shareholders. Restructuring plans should include targets for raising new capital and
a clear and credible exit strategy for public assistance to minimize the risk to the sovereign. The
authorities should monitor closely the implementation of the restructuring plan of Banca Monte
dei Paschi di Siena (MPS), which has received nearly €4 billion in public capital, and be prepared
to take action quickly if the bank fails to meet its targets.
49.
Corporate governance of the banking sector should be enhanced. Foundations that
are major shareholders in the banks should have in place proper governance frameworks,
including a cap on leverage and strict diversification rules. Banks should be subject to stringent
fit and proper tests for directors and controlling shareholders. To raise new capital, the large
cooperative banks should be encouraged to convert to joint stock companies (Box 5).
50.
A more robust framework for financing SMEs would help ease credit constraints.
Initiatives, such as the launch of mini-bonds, lending support from the Cassa Depositi e Prestiti,
and expansion of the Central Guarantee Fund have helped ease SME access to credit. The
authorities should monitor the expansion of its public credit guarantees for SMEs and strengthen
the fee system to limit moral hazard. At the euro area level, to address financial fragmentation,
the ECB could consider further unconventional policies, including through a targeted LTRO
(linked to new SME lending), or direct purchase of select private assets to promote SME
securitization and covered bonds.

Box 5. Improving the Governance of Foundations as Shareholders in Italian Banks1
Nonprofit foundations (Fondazioni) were created in the early 1990s to take over the capital of
privatized banks. Later, they were recognized as private legal entities, with full statutory and operational
autonomy and obliged to gradually sell their controlling interests. Foundations have served as stable longterm shareholders, helping banks to expand and modernize. They have supported the consolidation of the
banking system, and during the global crisis, provided nearly 22 percent of the capital raised by the largest
Italian banks.
Despite the legal mandate to diversify their investments, foundations still control or exercise
significant influence over 30 percent of the banking system. Foundations are major shareholders in four
of the top 10 groups: Banca Monte dei Paschi
di Siena (MPS), Banca Carige, Intesa and
Unicredit, and have used cross-holdings,

over the bank.2
Foundations pose a special challenge for the governance of the banks. Although foundations follow
some general corporate governance principles, they face weak internal accountability and are heavily
influenced by the interests of their membership. Foundations do not follow uniform accounting rules and
lack transparency in the appointment of their governing bodies. In 2003, the Constitutional Court curtailed
the supervisory powers of the Ministry of Economy and Finance, limiting oversight over the foundations.
Foundations also have very concentrated portfolios (with stakes varying from 30 to 90 percent in the original
bank) and at times use risky leverage to support their banks.
Reforms to enhance the governance of the foundations would strengthen the shareholder base for
Italian banks. Ensuring that foundations meet standards of transparency and audit and accounting
principles and move towards more balanced portfolios and prudent investment policies would strengthen
their role as stable investors in the banks. Foundations should remove restrictions on outside bank
shareholders’ voting to facilitate capital raising and be subject to strict related party transaction rules.

Authorities’ Views
51.
The BOI stressed the importance of its special inspections of the 20 large and
medium-sized banking groups in bolstering banks’ resilience and market confidence. The
inspections covered 40 percent of NPLs and included the valuation of banks’ real estate
collateral. The BOI issued a report summarizing the main results at end-July and plans to expand
these inspections to cover a wider range of loans and banks and make use of Pillar 2
requirements when providing further guidance on provisioning and valuation. Based on the
results, the BOI has asked banks to build up buffers by cutting costs and limiting dividend and
compensation payments where needed.

53.
A market for distressed assets could help reduce NPLs and facilitate corporate
restructuring. The authorities noted that a market for distressed assets with the participation of
foreign investors was active in the late 1990s and helped banks to reduce their NPLs. However,
banks remain reluctant to sell bad loans in a weak economy and prefer to hold the underlying
collateral. While interest is growing in selling to outside investors, the authorities stressed the
need for transparency in market transactions and that the risk transfer from banks to investors be
fully consistent with prudential rules and accounting standards.
54.
The authorities welcomed the recent steps towards strengthening the banking
union but called for more flexibility for national authorities to intervene. They welcomed
the European AQR and saw their own special inspections as helping banks prepare for the AQR
and stress tests. Adopting common rules and methodologies, especially for the definition of
NPLs and risk weights, would help ensure its success. Given Italian banks’ reliance on retail
bonds, the authorities raised concerns that the forthcoming Bank Recovery and Resolution
Directive (BRRD), which will require use of bail-in powers, would raise the cost of bank funding.
To address any stability issues in the run up to a European resolution mechanism, they favored
some flexibility in the bail-in rules under the BRRD. For MPS, delays agreeing with the
Commission on the bank’s restructuring plan have added to the difficulty in raising private

capital. The authorities do not expect further official support, but in the event the bank requires
public help, any new capital would fall under new EU State Aid rules.
55.
Further improvements in corporate governance will strengthen bank soundness.
The authorities have taken steps to strengthen banks’ corporate governance. To limit conflicts of
interests, they introduced a related party lending regulation and a ban on cross-appointments in
financial institutions with significant cross shareholdings. The authorities have also called on
cooperative banks to transform to joint stock companies, ensure adequate representation of
outside institutional investors, and raise capital from new members.
56.
The authorities saw the expansion of the credit guarantee and loan moratorium
program as critical for relieving SME’s credit constraints. To support SMEs, the government
has nearly doubled the size of the Central Guarantee Fund to €9.4 billion, raised the maximum
guarantee coverage from 60 to 80 percent, and eased the selection criteria. Despite the weak
economy, default rates on the guarantees have held steady at around 3 percent and are below
those for bank loans.

STAFF APPRAISAL

The economy is showing signs of stabilizing, but continues to face strong
headwinds. Sovereign pressures and the pace of fiscal adjustment have eased this year, but
financial conditions are tighter in Italy than in many other euro area countries. Growth is
projected at -1.8 percent in 2013, before rising to 0.7 percent next year, led by net exports.
58.
The risks, however, are tilted to the downside, stemming mainly from potential
policy slippages and banking distress. Italy remains vulnerable to financial contagion from its
high level of sovereign debt, sizeable financing needs, and large NPLs. In a downside scenario,
the outward spillovers from Italy could be considerable, given its central role in the global
trading and financial system.
59.
Weak productivity continues to undermine Italy’s competitiveness. Staff considers a
modest real effective depreciation of not more than 10 percent appropriate to restore
competitiveness, which could be achieved through structural reforms.
60.
Maintaining the momentum for reform is also essential to improve the business
environment and create jobs. More is needed to boost productivity and raise the employment
rate, especially of youth and women. To support the Youth Guarantee program, active labor
market policies could be made more efficient at the local level. Shifting to a more flexible, single
contract for new workers that increases job protection over time could lower the cost of new
hires and support apprenticeships. Encouraging companies and workers to set more firm-level
contracts would better match wages with productivity. Ongoing product market reforms should
be implemented expeditiously. Moreover, a more efficient civil judicial system could also have
significant cross-cutting benefits.

61.
Italy is set to reach its fiscal target of structural balance this year and should aim to
build a buffer in the medium term to cope with vulnerabilities. The sizeable consolidation in
2012 weighed heavily on growth but was crucial for Italy to exit the EU Excessive Deficit
Procedure. The structural balance target this year appropriately provides automatic flexibility to
the economic cycle. Over the medium term, after a recovery is underway, the authorities should
consider building a buffer for the structural balance rule to more rapidly reduce vulnerabilities
from the high public debt.
62.
A rebalancing of fiscal adjustment is urgently needed to support growth. Effective
implementation of the government’s payments to clear arrears could significantly ease firms’
credit constraints. Once legislated, the Delega Fiscale should improve the efficiency of the tax
system. But more should be done quickly to support growth. Savings from expenditure cuts and
a broader tax base would help achieve the government’s objective of reducing taxes on labor
and capital. The new local services tax should also cover primary residences for equity and
efficiency reasons, and the review of cadastral values accelerated to ensure fairness. The
privatization agenda should also be accelerated to reduce public debt.
63.
Stepping up efforts to tackle tax evasion and corruption would more fairly
distribute the tax burden and improve the business environment. Making greater use of
current AML tools, such as by broadening the scope of false accounting offenses, and
strengthening the AML framework, including criminalizing self-laundering, would support the
authorities’ efforts in these areas.
64.
Banks should have adequate buffers and accelerate write-offs of bad loans, to
strengthen their balance sheets and support lending. The deep recession and financial
fragmentation have undermined banks’ asset quality and profitability. Targeted action to
improve bank profitability and efficiency and to strengthen capital plans where needed would
shore up the resilience of Italian banks and help prepare for the forthcoming ECB/EBA AQR.
Encouraging further provisioning and write-offs, increasing tax deductibility of loan loss
provisions, and expediting the judicial process would accelerate the reduction of nonperforming
loans and the revival of new lending.
65.
Italy’s efforts should be complemented at the euro area level with steps to
strengthen the currency union and support growth. Direct purchases of select private asset
purchases by the ECB, an additional LTRO of sufficient tenor, and lower collateral haircuts and/or
a targeted LTRO linked to new SME lending would help reverse financial fragmentation. Greater
progress in the banking union, especially a strong single resolution mechanism, would help sever
the sovereign banking link. Moves to strengthen the common market, such as the Services
Directive, would enhance the cross-border benefits of reforms. Progress in European policies
combined with vigorous reforms in Italy would go far in producing a more vibrant and dynamic
currency union.
66.
It is recommended that the next Article IV Consultation takes place on the standard
12-month cycle.

Annex I: Debt Sustainability Analysis
At close to 130 percent of GDP, Italy’s public debt ratio is the second highest in the euro area and
financing needs are large, at about 23 percent of GDP in 2013, due to the rollover of existing debt.
At these high levels, the debt outlook is vulnerable to a variety of shocks, particularly contingent
liabilities and growth shocks. Given the debt structure (average maturity around 7 years), the direct
interest pass-through to the budget is relatively slow, but the impact of higher interest rates on
economic activity presents a significant threat to debt dynamics. While most debt profile indicators
are below early warning benchmarks, the country’s high total external financing requirements point
to continued vulnerability to changes in market perceptions.
Baseline and Realism of Projections1


Debt-levels. Staff forecast that the debt-to-GDP ratio will peak at 133 percent in 2014, before
declining to 123 percent by 2018. Despite fiscal effort, the debt-ratio is projected to be higher
than a year ago, as EFSF/ESM contributions (3 percent of GDP), the arrears clearance program
(2½ percent of GDP), along with the fiscal drag on growth, are forecast to push up the debt
ratio.



Growth. Growth outcomes in Italy have tended to be worse than projected. The current growth
projections are slightly above consensus and incorporate a positive impact from the arrears
clearance program. They assume a very slowly closing output gap. Nonetheless, risks are tilted
to the downside, highlighting the relevance of growth shocks in the stress tests.



Debt Profile. While the yields on Italian debt have moderated from earlier highs, the spreads
against the German bund-yields remain significant at 276 bps. Although spreads are assumed to
moderate from current levels, the effective interest rate is forecast to rise from 4.2 percent in
2013 to 4.7 percent in 2018. Given the debt structure (average maturity just under 7 years), the
direct interest pass-through to the budget is relatively slow; a 100 basis points shock across the
yield curve is estimated to raise the interest bill by about 0.2 percent of GDP. The government
financing needs are large, at around 23 percent of GDP in 2013, due to the rollover of existing
debt. Only 30 percent of marketable debt is held by non-residents, down from about 50 percent
in mid-2011. This decline reduces the rollover risk attributable to international investor worries,
but exacerbates domestic sovereign-bank links.



Fiscal adjustment: The structural primary balance improves with the implementation of fiscal
plans. From 2014, the constitutional requirement for a balanced budget in structural terms
requires modest additional adjustments that have yet to be identified. While the maximum
projected 3-year change of the cyclically-adjusted primary balance is in the top quartile of the
historical experience for high-debt market access countries, the bulk of that adjustment was
already undertaken in 2012. However, this large fiscal consolidation may lead to reform fatigue
(see primary balance shock and reform fatigue stress test).

3/ Bond Spread over German Bonds.
4/ Defined as interest payments divided by debt stock at the end of previous year.
5/ Derived as [(r - p(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; p = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;
a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
6/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 4 as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
7/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as ae(1+r).
8/ In 2012 and for projections, this line includes EFSF gurantees, arrears clearance payments, and exchange rate changes.

Shocks and Stress Tests


Primary balance shock. The implementation of fiscal adjustment plans are delayed by 1 year
relative to the baseline. The slippage leads to an increase in risk premiums (30 bps increase for
each 1 percent of GDP slippage). The debt-to-GDP ratio is about 3.5 percentage points higher
than the baseline by 2018. Gross financing needs average about 1¼ percent of GDP more than
the baseline.



Growth shock. Real output growth rates are lower by 1 standard deviation for 2 years starting in
2014. The nominal primary balance improves much more slowly than the baseline as nominal
revenues fall against unchanged expenditure plans, reaching only 2.8 percent of GDP by 2018.
The lower primary balance leads to an increase in risk premiums (30 bps increase for each 1
percent of GDP slippage). The debt-to-GDP ratio increases rapidly to about 145 percent during
the growth shock and then fails to come down over the projection period. Gross financing needs
climb toward 30 percent of GDP.



Interest rate shock. Market concerns about medium-term debt sustainability intensify
increasing spreads rise by 200 bps. The government’s interest bill climbs reaching an implicit
average interest rate of almost 5.5 percent by 2018. Higher borrowing costs are passed on to the
real economy, depressing growth. The debt-to-GDP ratio remains at 131 percent in 2018,
despite sizeable primary surpluses, and gross financing needs reach around 25 percent of GDP
by 2015.



Contingent liability shock. A one-time bail out of the financial sector increases non-interest
expenditures by 10 percent of banking sector assets. This is combined with real GDP growth
shock (1 standard deviation for 2 years). Sovereign borrowing costs are pushed up (30 bps for
each 1 percent of GDP worsening in the primary balance). The debt-to-GDP ratio rises above
160 percent and fails to stabilize. Gross financing needs jump to about 35 percent of GDP.



Reform fatigue stress test. Reform fatigue leads to a failure to improve on the forecast 2013
nominal primary balance. This is effectively a loosening in structural terms relative to baseline,
which supports short-term growth through reduced fiscal drag. However, confidence effects kick
in (30 bps for each 1 percent of GDP slippage in primary balance, plus 25 additional bps for each
year in which the debt-ratio fails to decline), pushing up the interest bill and dragging down
growth. Debt remains stuck at about 133 percent of GDP and gross financing needs reach 27
percent of GDP.



Deep recession and confidence stress test. This could potentially arise due to contagion from
the euro area crisis and slow progress in implementing domestic structural reforms. Annual GDP
growth is 0.5 to 1 percentage points lower than in the baseline. There is a 100 bps increase in
interest rates from 2014–18, which acts as a further drag on growth. These assumptions push the
debt-to-GDP ratio above 135 percent in 2014 and keep it on a rising path. Gross financing needs
rise about 27 percent of GDP by 2018

Annex II. Balance Sheet Vulnerabilities from the Italian
Household and Corporate Sectors11
Italian households’ considerable net wealth has mitigated credit risk to the banks.
However, the financial situation of non-financial corporations, in particular SMEs, is fragile, and the
sector is vulnerable to shocks. Given its importance as a source of collateral for loans, a shock to the
real estate sector could also trigger vulnerabilities for the banks.
1.
The debt burden of Italian households is modest, and “vulnerable” households hold a
small proportion of debt. Household income has declined during the crisis, leading to tighter
financial conditions, in particular for low-income and young households. However, only 22 percent
of households are indebted. “Vulnerable households”—conservatively defined as households with
debt service above 30 percent of income—represent 10 percent of indebted households, and hold
24 percent of total household debt, with total household debt representing about 50 percent of
GDP. “Vulnerable” households that that have a negative net wealth position hold only 1.2 percent of
household debt (“debt-at-risk”).
Credit risk from households is mitigated by their positive net wealth position. Italian
households hold close to 800 percent of disposable income in net wealth, defined as real and
financial assets minus financial debt, of which two thirds are real assets. In a downside scenario
where income declines by 3 percent (similar to the decline in gross household disposable income
since 2008) and interest rates increase by 100 bps (similar to the increase in rates on new mortgages
in 2011–12), the share of “vulnerable” households would increase to 11 percent and debt-at-risk
would remain small at 1.3 percent. Even the combination of more extreme shocks to interest rates
(+300 bps) and income (-15 percent) would modestly raise debt-at-risk to 1.6 percent.

3.
However, a shock to real estate, as the predominant source of household wealth and
collateral for loans, could increase bank losses. During the decade preceding the crisis, housing
prices and sales rose modestly, in line with euro area averages. However, since 2006, housing
transactions have dropped by more than 50 percent, mainly due to the deterioration in households’
financial situation and tighter lending conditions, while housing prices have fallen from their peak
cumulatively by almost 7 percent since 2011. Affordability indices suggest that the gap between
market and long-term prices is limited, but the weak economic outlook is likely to put further
downward pressure on prices, consistent with the current slow sale times (more than 8 months) and
considerable discount-to-ask price (16 percent). A sensitivity analysis shows that a further 5 percent
decline in housing prices would increase debt-at-risk only modestly, reflecting the prudent loan-tovalue ratios applied to mortgages. Nonetheless, given the important share of real assets, a larger
shock to house prices (20 percent) would trigger household balance sheet vulnerabilities, as debt-atrisk would reach 12 percent.

The corporate sector was hit hard by the crisis, pushing up NPLs for the banks.
Although the level of indebtedness of Italian firms is moderate, at 115 percent of GDP, leverage is
high at 57 percent, compared to 50 percent on average for the euro area (debt to debt plus equity),
and concentrated mainly in SMEs. Weak corporate profitability and tight credit conditions have
worsened asset quality, with the NPL ratio for firms rising to 25 percent in May 2013, up from
10 percent before the crisis. The gap between large and small firms has also closed considerably.

in 2008, it has been rising over the past two years.12
SMEs and firms in the construction and real estate sectors are found to have a larger proportion of
debt at risk, consistent with the sectors’ high and rising default rates.

6.
Italian firms are vulnerable to profit and
interest rate shocks. The impact on firms’ debtservicing capacity of a 15 percent decline in
operating income or a 100 bps increase in interest
rates is likely to be moderate, but a combined shock
could increase the proportion of debt at risk to
55 percent. Reflecting a weaker starting point, smaller
firms are most vulnerable to shocks, and up to
65 percent of their debt would be at risk in the
combined shock scenario.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
ITALY—STATISTICAL ISSUES APPENDIX
As of July 23, 2013
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is adequate for surveillance. Italy’s economic and financial statistics are comprehensive
and of generally high quality. Data are provided to the Fund in a comprehensive manner (see Table 1). The
authorities regularly publish a full range of economic and financial data, as well as a calendar of dates for the
main statistical releases. Italy is also subject to the statistical requirements of Eurostat and the European
Central Bank (ECB), including the timeliness and reporting standards,) and it has adopted the European System
of Accounts 1995 (ESA95).
National Accounts: Further improvements should be considered regarding changes in inventories in the
quarterly national accounts, which are currently derived as a residual and lumped together with the statistical
discrepancy.
Price Statistics:
Government Finance Statistics:
Monetary and Financial Statistics:
Financial Sector Surveillance: Participates in the IMF’s Coordinated Direct Investment Survey (CDIS),
Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS) and financial soundness indicators (FSIs) databases.
External Sector Statistics: The first transmission of International Investment Position (IIP) data on the basis of
the Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual, 6 th edition (BPM6) will take place in
June 2014, as envisaged by the work plan agreed with the ECB and the Eurosystem national central banks.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Italy has subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) since 1996

A data ROSC was

and posts its metadata on the Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB). Italy

disseminated in 2002.

has shown interest in adhering to the SDDS Plus; an STA mission found that Italy
could be among the initial adherents when the SDDS Plus is launched.
Implementing G-20 DGI recommendations: The authorities have already
implemented a good number of the recommendations and work is underway to
implement the remaining ones. Further progress in the near future is likely to be
made on the reporting frequency of Financial Soundness Indicators.

Statement by Mr. Montanino, Executive Director for Italy
September 23, 2013
Authorities wish to thank staff for the balanced analysis provided in the insightful set of
papers on Italy. They agree on most recommendations, while on possible vulnerabilities of
the private sector, both financial and non-financial, they wish to provide some remarks.
Overall, Authorities concur that the most pressing goals are to:
1. Sustain economic recovery in the short term;
2. Raise potential growth over the medium term through measures that increase
competitiveness and structural reforms;
3. Maintain market confidence through a rigorous execution of the public budget;
4. Further strengthening the financial sector.
Sustain economic recovery
After a negative GDP result in the first half of 2013, over the latest months a number of
indicators have pointed to a gradual stabilization of the cycle. The upturn in GDP is expected
to materialize by the last quarter of this year, in line with staff’s forecast. To stimulate the
recovery, Authorities have taken a number of measures:
i. Clearance of arrears. To ease tight credit conditions for firms and support domestic demand,
the Government committed to pay arrears to non-financial firms for a total of €40 billion
in 2013-2014. By the beginning of this month, the central government provided local
authorities (firms’ debtors) with 90 per cent of the amount projected for 2013 (i.e. €18
billion). In turn, local governments already paid €7.2 billion to their creditors.
ii. Ease credit constraints. Since one of the main constraints to growth are the very tight
financing conditions, the Government enacted several policy measures to tackle the issue.
They include: the expansion of the Central Guarantee Fund for SMEs which guarantees
up to 80 per cent of the loan; the lending support from Cassa Depositi e Prestiti through
additional liquidity to the banking sector; the development of alternative financing
sources for SMEs (so-called mini-bonds); the development of publicly supported equity
funds (Strategic Investment Fund for large companies and the Italian Investment Fund for
SMEs).
iii. Property tax (IMU). To sustain confidence and households spending at this juncture, in
August the Government decided on a one-off basis to repeal the payment of the first
installment of the IMU tax. The measure is fully compensated in the public budget.
iv. Reduction in labor tax wedge. Last but not least, given the very difficult situation in the
labor market, the Government is considering possible measures to reduce the very high
tax wedge. This would add to the already implemented tax credits for firms to support
new hiring; incentives are particularly sizeable for women and young people.

2
Raise potential growth
The Italian economy has been characterized by a disappointing productivity performance,
with a highly negative impact on potential growth. Over the past few years, the Italian
authorities have already adopted measures to improve the business environment. Specifically,
measures have aimed to reform the labor market institutions, to provide firms with tax
incentives to raise risk capital (so-called ACE), to boost the quality and efficiency of the
public administration. In this regard, continued action has been taken to simplify the
regulatory environment, to cut red tape, to enhance coordination between the different
government levels, and to improve the functioning of the judicial system.
As indicated in the SIP on judicial reform, removing Italy’s bottlenecks is key to attract
foreign investment. The Government is launching a wide set of micro-measures to improve
business confidence. Among others, further strengthening the role of specialized judicial
courts for firms, promoting cooperative compliance between foreign investors and the
Revenue Agency, implementing the Digital Agenda to enhance public administration
efficiency and reduce the administrative burden on firms and households.

Rigorous execution of the public budget
Despite disappointing economic conditions, Italy has continued to deliver on its
commitments. Last June, the country exited from the Excessive Deficit Procedure (EDP)
started in 2009, having achieved in 2012 a general government deficit of 3.0 per cent of GDP,
down from 5.5 per cent in 2009. It is worth noting that this result came well ahead many
other advanced countries while, at 2.5 per cent of GDP last year, Italy’s primary balance
ranked among the highest in the euro area, together with Germany.
As for the fiscal framework, in 2013 the general government deficit target is firmly set within
the 3 per cent of GDP limit. This will be reaffirmed by the Government in the coming days,
before the Board discussion, when presenting to the Parliament the targets for coming years.
The structural balance target by 2014 is now enshrined in the Constitution. According to
staff’s estimates, Italy is expected to come close to this target already this year, one year
ahead of schedule.
With a more forward looking view, the Government is also committed to enhance the
spending review to achieve structural savings in the budget. To improve coordination among
ministers, a Special Commissioner for the spending review is going to be appointed shortly.
Moreover, to improve fiscal stability, authorities assign high importance to the fight against
tax evasion. In the draft enabling law on tax issues (“Delega fiscale”), the Government is
committed to provide a regular estimate on tax evasion elaborated by an independent
Commission.
Finally, in line with the staff’s suggestion to roll back tax expenditures, the “Delega Fiscale”
engages the Government in presenting a systematic and regular annual report on tax
expenditures, with the aim of repealing the inefficient ones.

3
Further strengthening the financial sector
Despite a string of unprecedented negative shocks over six years (global financial crisis, two
domestic recessions, euro area sovereign debt crisis), Italy’s financial system held up well,
due to its traditional business model and effective regulation and supervision.
Notwithstanding a difficult environment, Italy’s banks were able to increase their capital
ratios and raise residents’ deposits. By end-2012, bank tier 1 and total capital ratios were
respectively 11.1 and 13.8 per cent. The core tier 1 capital ratio rose on average to 10.7 per
cent, achieved with very modest public support (0.3 percent of GDP, see Figure 1).

That said, Authorities broadly agree that the prolonged double-dip recession has deteriorated
credit quality, weakened banks’ profitability, and inflated NPLs. At end-2012, NPLs stood at
13.4 per cent of loans, for the most part attributable to non-financial firms. Although lower
than in other countries, at 40 per cent, the coverage ratio has stabilized. To provide a
meaningful comparison across countries, it should be recalled that Bank of Italy’s definition
of NPLs is stricter than elsewhere. For example, while some major European banks do not
classify fully collateralized loans as NPLs, in Italy loans are classified on the basis of the
borrower’s creditworthiness irrespective of collateral guarantees. Applying the prevailing
criteria used by foreign banks, the share of Italy’s NPLs would decrease by one-third,
lowering their NPLs ratio significantly and raising their coverage ratio; at the same time, the
rise in NPL ratio in the recent years would be less pronounced, reflecting the sharp increase
in collateral demanded by Italian banks in reaction to the deteriorating economic outlook.

4
Because of the credit quality deterioration, in the second half of 2012 the Bank of Italy
enacted a strengthened inspection in 20 large and mid-sized banks. The coverage ratio of the
banks under investigation rose from 41 to 43 per cent by end-2012. Authorities broadly agree
with staff on the need to continue to be vigilant on this front. Regarding the staff’s proposal
of increasing tax deductibility of loan loss provisions and accelerating the write-offs of bad
loans, the Government is fully aware of the shortcomings of the current situation and will
examine all the options to remove the tax disincentives, provided that the conditions of the
public accounts allow.
Authorities also welcome the progress towards an effective EU banking union. The asset
quality reviews to be conducted in 2014 by the ECB will also allow a homogenous
assessment of Italy’s banking system towards its peers.
Despite the exceptional slack of the economic system, FSAP stress tests point out that, thanks
to its capital strengthening, the Italian banking system is resilient. In all the scenarios
considered, the capital adequacy of the system as whole remains above the Basel III minima.
At a disaggregated level, only a few banks would face a capital shortfall. In any case, the
amount of such a shortfall would be very limited (0.4 per cent of GDP in the most adverse
scenario if the Core Tier 1 minima are considered).
Finally, as regards the assessment of the financial situation of households and corporate
contained in Appendix II, we would like to provide a few remarks to complete the overall
picture. First, on households, it has to be stressed that, by international standards, their debt
level is low and their wealth is very high (Fig. 2a and b). The vulnerability coming from this
sector is indeed very limited.

Second, the stock of debt of the corporate sector measured as a share of GDP is below the
euro area average although Italian firms traditionally rely significantly on bank credit, and
less on risk capital. The recently growing financial tensions of Italy’s firms are mainly due to

5
the impact on their profitability coming from a very harsh recession and the effects of
financial fragmentation in the euro area. In this respect, the lessening of these difficulties will
benefit from the return to a positive rate of growth which, as said, is expected for the last part
of this year. Besides, Authorities intend to pursue further efforts to help firms diversify their
funding sources through the development of the capital market and the possibility for the
unlisted companies to issue bonds.
