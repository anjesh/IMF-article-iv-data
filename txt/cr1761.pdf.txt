IMF Executive Board Concludes 2016 Article IV Consultation with Somalia and
Somalia Completes the First Review under the Staff–Monitored Program
On February 3, 2017, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation1 with Somalia.
Over the past five years, Somalia has marked important milestones in rebuilding its economy
and normalizing relations with international financial institutions. In 2012, Somalia emerged
from nearly two decades of civil war. However, the post-war social and economic conditions
remain difficult, poverty is widespread, and more than half of the working-age population is
unemployed. The Federal Government of Somalia (FGS), elected and recognized by the
international community in 2012, continues to face weak institutional capacity, fragile
security, and complex clan politics which complicate economic reconstruction. With donors’
support, progress is being made in the FGS’s efforts to improve security, capacity
development, and state building.
The IMF resumed its relationship with Somalia in 2013 and has since been heavily involved
in the provision of policy advice and technical assistance. The IMF Executive Board
concluded the 2015 Article IV Consultation with Somalia in July 2015, the country’s first in
more than a quarter-century. And the IMF Managing Director approved a Staff-Monitored
Program (SMP) in 2016, covering the period May 2016 through April 2017. The SMP aims
to help Somalia’s economic reconstruction efforts and focuses on reforms to strengthen
macroeconomic policy management, economic governance, and institutional capacity. Given
Somalia’s weak administrative capacity, technical assistance is an integral part of the
program.
Despite a very difficult political environment, the FGS continues to make significant efforts
toward restoring its key economic and financial institutions. The government approved a
public financial management (PFM) law, initiated electronic payments of civil service and
police wages, submitted the 2015 financial statements of the FGS to the auditor general,

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a
report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

approved the 2016–20 PFM reform action plan, and adopted a draft National Development
Plan (NDP). In connection with the authorities’ currency reform plan, the Central Bank of
Somalia (CBS) was recently reconstituted and has since fully staffed its cash management
department, prepared a draft anti-counterfeit strategy, and adopted a detailed roadmap for
currency reform. In addition, an external audit of the CBS’s 2014 financial statement was
completed.
The Somali economy is expected to continue to be sustained by donors' grants, remittances,
and foreign direct investment, mostly by the Somali diaspora. Economic activity is projected
to decelerate in 2016–17. Growth is projected to be 3.4 percent and 2.5 percent in 2016 and
2017, respectively. The deceleration in growth mainly reflects the impact of the drought on
the agriculture sector, which will be partially offset by activities in the construction,
telecommunications, and service sectors. Meanwhile, inflation is estimated to be 1.5 percent
in 2016 and projected to pick up to 2.7 percent in 2017. The annual trade deficit during
2014–15 was about 55.5 percent of GDP and was largely financed by remittances and grants.
For the same period, the current account registered an annual deficit of 8.6 percent of GDP
and was covered mostly by foreign direct investment, mainly by Somali diaspora.
The fiscal position was strained in 2016. Budgetary grants and tax revenue fell short,
reflecting delayed disbursements and weak tax collection performance. Meanwhile,
expenditure on goods and services continued to increase, in part due to the election and
security spending.
Going forward, the FGS will continue to implement measures to improve the fiscal
framework, raise tax revenue, and implement structural reforms. The authorities plan to
revise their National Development Plan, allowing it to become the FGS’s key development
policy tool.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors commended the authorities for the significant progress made in
rebuilding the economy and restoring key economic and financial institutions in a difficult
political and security environment. Directors emphasized that strong policy implementation
is necessary to address the challenges ahead, boost economic activity, and improve
livelihoods. Continued support by the donor community would also be vital in this regard.
Directors noted that budget execution remains difficult because of weak tax collection, poor
public financial management, and delays in grant disbursements. They stressed that greater
fiscal discipline and stronger budget execution would improve fiscal performance. Directors

welcomed the authorities’ continued efforts to improve public financial management and
contingent measures to deal with domestic arrears and limit delayed payments.
Directors underscored that steady improvement in tax collection would help mitigate the
impact from volatility of grants and meet security and social spending needs. To broaden the
tax base, they encouraged the authorities to swiftly adopt the Appropriation Bill to endorse
the tax code.
Directors supported the authorities’ currency reform strategy. They noted that this reform
would limit counterfeiting, restore credibility of the national currency, and allow the central
bank to conduct monetary policy. Directors concurred that sound and successful
implementation of the currency reform hinges on careful preparation and planning. They
advised the authorities to follow through on the currency reform roadmap as agreed with the
staff.
Directors welcomed the plan to overhaul the financial sector and improve the operations of
the central bank, as well as commercial bank accounting and reporting standards. They
stressed that jump starting financial intermediation is critical to enhancing Somalia’s
economic growth. Directors welcomed the progress in advancing financial sector reform,
including efforts to bring banks into compliance with prudential norms, and combating the
financing of terrorism (AML/CFT). They stressed that aligning the AML/CFT law with
international standards and ensuring an effective risk-based implementation would safeguard
the flow of remittances into Somalia.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ plan to continue to improve the national development
plan (NDP). They emphasized that the NDP should give priority to social safety net and
pressing humanitarian conditions.
Directors agreed that a steadfast effort to rebuild Somalia’s key institutions and governance
remains critical. They were encouraged by the increasing focus of the Financial Governance
Committee (FGC) on institution building, governance, and reorganization of the Ministry of
Finance and the central bank. Noting the significant shortcomings in economic data
provision, they called for swift adoption of the long-delayed statistical law.
Directors urged continued strong policy implementation under the Staff-Monitored Program
(SMP) and subsequent SMPs. This would help establish a durable economic track record as a
basis for future program engagement with the Fund and eventual debt relief.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
AND FIRST REVIEW UNDER THE STAFF-MONITORED
PROGRAM

KEY ISSUES
Context and background. Over the past five years, Somalia has marked important
milestones in rebuilding its economy and normalizing relations with international financial
institutions. After more than two decades of a civil war that caused significant damage to
the country’s social and economic infrastructure, the Federal Government of Somalia (FGS)
was elected and recognized by the international community in 2012. With donors’
support, progress is being made in the FGS’s efforts to improve security, capacity
development, and state building. However, significant challenges remain ahead to rebuild
the economy and institutions and improve social conditions. The IMF resumed its
relationship with Somalia in 2013 and has since been heavily involved in the provision
of policy advice and technical assistance, particularly in the context of the 12-month StaffMonitored Program (SMP) which was approved by the IMF Managing Director in May
2016. Despite a very difficult political environment and complex clan politics, the FGS
continues to make significant efforts toward restoring its key economic and financial
institutions and keeping the SMP on track.
Macroeconomic situation, outlook, and risks. The Somali economy is expected to
continue to be sustained by donors' grants, remittances, and foreign direct investment
mostly by the Somali diaspora. Reflecting a looming drought, economic activity is
expected to slow down in 2016–17. Revenue shortfalls and delays in pledged donors
support are making budget execution difficult. Risks to the outlook and the program are
tilted to the downside and stem mainly from fragile security, expenditure overrun in the
lead-up to the presidential elections, weak revenue collection and administrative capacity,
and repeated delays of the electoral process which could weaken donors’ support to the
FGS.
Review under the SMP. Performance under the SMP through the end of September 2016
was broadly satisfactory. Six out of seven quantitative benchmarks (set for the end of
September) and all the structural benchmarks for the first review were met. In light of the
broadly satisfactory program implementation so far, remedial measures to address the
lone missed target, and the authorities’ strong commitment to policy implementation
under the SMP, staff support the completion of the first review of the SMP.

SOMALIA

Focus of the Article IV Consultation and policy discussions. Discussions focused on:
(1) fiscal policy and reform measures to improve fiscal discipline, budget execution,
revenue mobilization, and contingent measures to avoid arrears; (2) currency reform and
reviving of the financial sector; (3) the national development plan (NDP), inclusive growth
and social safety net; (4) the economic implications of repatriating Somali refugees from
Kenya; (5) institutional capacity building; and (6) remittances and money transfer
businesses.
Key policy recommendations. The authorities are urged to: (1) pass the 2017
Appropriation Bill to endorse the tax code and step up efforts to mobilize tax revenue;
(2) improve fiscal management and budget execution; (3) adhere to agreed plans to avoid
arrears and limit delayed payments; (4) follow through with the currency reform roadmap
and revive the financial sector; and (5) revise the NDP with more focus on required
funding, social safety net program, capacity development, and humanitarian needs.
Authorities’ views. The authorities agreed with staff’s assessment and balance of risks.
They also acknowledged that in the absence of remedial measures, the fiscal risks could
be higher. They, however, remain committed to stronger fiscal discipline, avoiding new
arrears, raising tax revenue, and implementing structural reforms. They felt strongly that
currency reform and reviving the financial sector represent priority areas, while
acknowledging that the preconditions for issuing a new currency must be in place first.
The authorities plan to revise the NDP with a greater focus on funding needs, institution
building, and developing social safety net programs—including those for Somali
refugees—supporting existing humanitarian programs in coordination with donors. To
mitigate risks to the program, they felt that continued progress under the SMP, and
political, sustained, and coordinated international support—including with regards to
security, peace, and capacity building—are needed.

BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT
1.
Overview. Somalia is a fragile state that emerged in 2012 from a two decade-long civil
war that caused significant damage to the country’s social and economic infrastructure. Post-war
social and economic conditions continue to be difficult, with poverty widespread and more than
half the working-age population unemployed. The Federal Government of Somalia (FGS)
continues to face weak institutional capacity, fragile security, and complex clan politics which
complicate economic reconstruction.
2.
The security situation remains fragile. The Al-Shabaab group has continued to launch
sporadic attacks, despite recent gains by the Somali national army and African Union (AU) troops.
3.
Political developments. The presidential elections have been postponed for the fourth
time in a row.1 The international community had expressed concern over repeated delays and
pressed for a peaceful, transparent, and inclusive electoral process in order to send a strong
signal of electoral order to the people of Somalia and international partners. They stressed the
urgent need to swiftly conclude the electoral process by January 19 and warned of the risks of
further delays (including compromising donors’ support to the FGS).
4.
Fund relations. The IMF recognized the FGS in April 2013. The IMF Executive Board
concluded the 2015 Article IV Consultation with Somalia in July 2015, the country’s first in more
than a quarter-century.2 Somalia’s overdue financial obligations to the IMF were last reviewed by
the Executive Board on December 2015. The next review was postponed to take into account the
outcome of the 2016 Article IV discussions and the first review of the SMP and to be considered
by the Executive Board together.3 Somalia is in arrears to the Fund ($319.4 million, 537.6 percent
of quota, as of the end of December 2016)4 and is therefore ineligible for financial support from
the Fund. IMF management approved a 12-month Staff-Monitored Program (SMP) in May (May
2016–April 2017, Countrty Report No. 16/136), marking another milestone in normalizing
relations between Somalia and international financial institutions. The authorities have since
continued to move forward with their reform agenda, making significant progress in areas
recommended under the SMP and the 2015 Article IV recommendations (Box 1).

Box 1. Somalia: The 2015 Article IV Policy Recommendations and Follow-Up
On July 27, 2015, Somalia completed its first Article IV Consultation with the IMF since November 18, 1989.
Executive Directors recognized that Somalia is facing daunting challenges and they stressed that the first priority is
to continue building institutions and administrative capacity. They also urged the Somali government to take
decisive steps toward building fiscal discipline, underpinned by realistic budgeting and effective implementation
systems, including commitment controls. On banking and financial policy, Directors welcomed the Central Bank of
Somalia’s (CBS) currency reform initiative, supported by the Fund’s TA. They stressed that the elaboration of a
financial sector roadmap would be a critical first step toward building credibility in licensing and supervising banks
and money transfer businesses (MTBs).
The authorities have continued to move forward with their reform agenda by making significant progress
in areas recommended by Directors. On May 16, 2016 IMF management approved an SMP to support the FGS
and to establish a track record of policy implementation. Prior to the approval of the SMP, the authorities
demonstrated tangible commitment by implementing key measures, including: (1) adopting an Appropriation Bill
consistent with a zero-cash balance; (2) setting up an institutional framework for fiscal data reporting; (3) adopting
an arrears-management strategy as part of their public financial management (PFM) reform; and (4) approving the
key principles for currency reform.
Reform implementation momentum is continuing under the SMP.



On fiscal policy and reforms, the authorities completed electronic payments of civil service wages,
submitted the 2015 financial statements to the Auditor General, and approved the 2016–20 public financial
management (PFM) reform action plan. The implementation of the commitment system, which has been
delayed, is expected to start in January 2017, and the stock-taking of existing bank accounts of Ministries,
Departments, and Agencies (MDAs) is underway.



On currency reform, the CBS has reconstituted a fully staffed cash management department, and prepared a
draft anti-counterfeit strategy and roadmap for currency reform.



On financial sector policy, the authorities achieved: (1) the completion of the audit of the financial statement
of the CBS for 2014; (2) continue to reach out to foreign banks to recover missing, lost, or stolen assets; (3) the
recruitment of a reputable Trusted Agent to work with MTBs on anti-money laundering and combating the
financing of terrorism (AML/CFT), in addition to assisting the CBS to help secure confidence in the payment
system and safeguard the continued flow of international remittances to Somalia; (4) banks are now
complying with prudential norms; (5) as of September 2016, banks have started publishing quarterly financial
statements; (6) the adoption of a foreign direct investment (FDI) law; and (7) under the World Bank’s project
“Core Banking System,” a new financial infrastructure for CBS banking operations is being developed.



On technical assistance (TA), efforts to restore key economic and financial institutions continue. From June
2013 to December 2016, the IMF delivered 66 TA missions, including training in its areas of expertise and
14 TA missions delivered support to the Financial Governance Committee.

ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS, OUTLOOK, AND RISKS
The Somali economy is expected to continue to be sustained by donors’ grants, remittances,
and investment by the Somali diaspora. Reflecting a looming drought, economic activity is
expected to slow down, with inflation projected to pick up in 2016–17. Risks are tilted to the
downside, emanating mainly from weak institutions and fiscal performance, and the fragile
security situation.

tax revenue are projected to fall short in 2016, reflecting delayed disbursement and weak
performance, respectively. Meanwhile, expenditures on goods and services increased, in part due
to the presidential elections and security spending. To maintain the fiscal balance at zero (on
cash basis), the authorities opted to delay some salary payments for November and December.7
7.
The Central Bank of Somalia (CBS) is slowly resuming its activities (Table 3). Available
data indicate that the gross assets of the CBS declined slightly between December 2015 and
September 2016, largely reflecting the drop in cash held in vaults (from $13.3 million in
December to $9.8 million).8

exchange rate has remained

8.
The financial sector is being revived. The Somali financial sector is rudimentary with
limited intermediation.10 It consists of six commercial banks—which mainly act as money
exchange and trade financing institutions for their owners—and 12 Money-Transfer Business
(MTBs).11 In June 2016, the total assets of the six licensed commercial banks reached $214
million, up from $170 million 12 months prior, an increase of 26 percent. Bank capitalization
increased sharply by an average of 24 percent.12 However, two out of the six banks representing

The decline during this period reflects, in part, the theft of $530,000 in August 2016 (see ¶20–21).

9

Payments are settled in U.S. dollars, mobile phone platforms, and counterfeit SOS banknotes.

10

Some intermediations have started recently and banks are also beginning to make more Islamic investments.

11

There are 12 licensed MTBs, and 4 registered MTBs that are operating in Somalia. The MTBs provide
international money transfer service, generally to households, and in many cases act as quasi-bank by providing
financial services to handful of the population. Recent assessment of MTBs compliance carried out by the Trusted
Agent (Box 1) found that MTBs are not fully implementing the existing compliance and their policies and
practices are yet to be consistent with the regulations.
12

All but one bank meet the minimum capital requirement of $5 million. Commercial banking activity is
geographically concentrated in Mogadishu, with each institution having only a few branches in other parts of the
country, typically engaged in money transfers and trade finance. An additional 13 applications for commercial
bank licenses are pending.

about 12 percent of total assets have been reporting negative income, suggesting caution for
pockets of vulnerabilities on their solvency. Bank loans—both in the forms of Islamic investment
and traditional loans— increased on an annual basis to $51.4 million in June 2016 from $42.2
million in June 2015, a 22 percent increase.13
9.
The authorities agreed that the outlook is subject to significant domestic and
external risks, stemming from both global uncertainties and weaknesses in domestic factors (as
detailed in the Risk Assessment Matrix–RAM, Box 2).14


External risks include spillovers from the protracted conflicts in the Middle East which could
weaken demand for Somali exports, reduce donor support, and decrease remittances. Tighter
international regulatory and supervisory frameworks could also further slow remittances.



Domestic risks include the loss of expenditure control and slowdown in reform
implementation in the run-up to the presidential elections, which could weaken the fiscal
position, in particular revenue collection; weak institutional capacity, which could undermine
critical reforms to mobilize revenues and public financial management; drought conditions in
some key regions of Somalia;15 repeated delays in the electoral process, which could
compromise donors’ support to the FGS; fragile security; and poor financial system
supervision, including the need to strengthen compliance with anti-money laundering and
combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) in line with international standards.

1 Based on the July 2016 Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM). The RAM shows events that could materially alter the baseline outlook (the
scenario most likely to materialize in the view of Fund staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment
of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability of
10-30 percent, and “high” a probability of 30 percent or more). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level
of concern at the time of discussions with authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.

PROGRAM PERFORMANCE, MODALITIES, AND RISKS
Performance under the SMP is broadly satisfactory. All the structural benchmarks (SBs) and six
out of seven quantitative benchmarks (QBs) set for the first review were met. The authorities
and staff agreed to introduce two new SBs. Going forward, a worse-than-anticipated security
situation could slow program implementation, repeated delays of the electoral process could
weaken donors’ support to the FGS, and fiscal risks, if realized, could be harmful in the
absence of remedial measures. Staff support the authorities’ corrective measures to address
missed target and contingent plans to mitigate risks.
10.
All SMP indicative quantitative targets for June 2016 (indicative targets) were met.
On structural benchmarks, the only target for June (“The Minister of Finance to approve the
2016–20 public financial management (PFM) reform action plan”) was also met.
11.
Performance under the SMP through the end of September 2016 was broadly
satisfactory. All the SBs and six out of seven QBs (set for the end of September 2016) for the
first review were met (Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies or MEFP ¶7, MEFP Table
1 and 2). Due mainly to the delayed disbursement of budgetary grants by two bilateral donors,
new estimated arrears of approximately $10 million were accumulated in payments of wages and
allowances at the end of September, but were subsequently paid in full as part of donors’ grants
was received.
12.
The authorities have also advanced the implementation of their structural reforms,
as spelled out in the MEFP ¶7 (bullets #3, 4, and 5). In addition, two out of three SBs set for
December 2016 have been completed and one is in progress: (1) the issuance of commercial
bank and MTB licenses now requires approval by the CBS Board of Directors; (2) a report on the
process and design of an electronic payment system for the Somali National Army and Police
with biometric screening capability is completed; and (3) the benchmark of achieving
100 percent of non-salary Recurrent Cost and Reform Financing reimbursement which has been
delayed is expected to be completed by March 2017. A prime ministerial decree that requires all
foreign grant agreements to be cosigned by the Minister of Finance (set for March 2017) has
been completed. Moreover, an action plan to improve cash management, and a plan to
modernize revenue and customs administration (both structural benchmarks for March 2017),
are being developed. However, on data provision, the authorities agreed that while the business
registry was technically completed (an SB set for the end of September 2016), to operationalize
the process, the registry would need to be improved and consolidated. In addition, passage of
the new Statistical Law would be critical.16
13.
The SMP’s key policy objectives remain unchanged. Staff support the authorities’
corrective measures to address the missed QB. The authorities and staff also agreed to modify

The law includes articles on statistical system, statistical confidentiality, cooperation between state agencies on
data sharing.

the SB on CBS issuance of banknotes in light of the roadmap developed to launch the new
currency. Also, two new SBs have been proposed in the areas of revenue measures and currency
reform.
Corrective measures to avoid new arrears. The QB on non-accumulation of new domestic
arrears set for the end of September was missed.



17



In staff’s view, this constitutes a temporary slippage that does not jeopardize the
successful implementation of the program. In the absence of a program adjustor for a
shortfall in grants, staff support the authorities’ corrective measures to avoid new
arrears and limit delayed payments.



Remedial measures include: (1) improve budget execution, through prioritizing the
payment of salaries in December to Ministries, Departments, and Administrations
(MDAs); (2) strict adherence to the new arrears management strategy; and (3) realistic
revenue and grant forecasts and stronger resolve for improving domestic revenue
mobilization, including greater enforcement of tax collections.



Delayed payments in Somalia have been a practice to manage liquidity. This has
generally led to accumulation of arrears. In December, due to financing pressures in the
lead up to the presidential elections and contingent spending,17 the authorities delayed
November and December 2016 salary payments until early 2017. Staff expressed concern
over such a practice and recommended that the deferred amount be included in the
2017 budget and paid fully to avoid new arrears. While the FGS cash flow situation came
under pressure due to unplanned expenditures, staff noted that deferred payments have
been the result of delays in grant disbursement, and weak revenue performance, as well
as weak public financial management (that is, using deferred payments as a means to
manage treasury cash flows). Staff recommended that improving treasury single account
(TSA), cash management, and arrears management be made high priorities for the
2017 budget measures (¶18). Moreover, staff stressed that the authorities should also
remain current on all future bills and adhere strictly to the sequestration18 provisions in
the 2016 Appropriation Law.



In addition, further efforts to prevent new arrears and limit delayed payments include the
effective start of the new payment process reforms and implementation of the
commitment system roll-out (MEFP ¶12) in January 2017.19 This is a significant shift from
the current practice—which is mainly based on manual payment processing—to a

On security, arrears, and transfers to regions.

18

The sequestration rule refers to expenditure payment prioritization. In the event that treasury cash/liquidity is
not sufficient to make all payments, salaries, and other current and capital expenditure payments should be made
before payments of arrears.
19

The delay in implementation of the commitment system also affected the schedule of the new arrears
management strategy.

SOMALIA

realtime tracking of payment obligations of all line MDAs. Also, the authorities intend to
further strengthen the TSA system by evaluating existing bank accounts which would
result in closing non-critical accounts and consolidating the rest. Staff believe that the
effectiveness of these measures will solidify efforts to avoid new arrears and limit delayed
payments.




New SB on revenue measures. A new SB on passing the 2017 Appropriation Bill has been
introduced to endorse the tax code rate for income and sales taxes to help re-enforce the
existing tax laws for income and sales taxes for telecommunications, electricity and water
supply companies, as well as hotels (see ¶15 for more discussion). With the enforcement of
this measure, staff believe that the projected revenue (¶17 and Text Table 3) can be achieved.


On the one hand, there is upside potential to the tax revenue measures resulting from
the authorities’ plan to enforce a Cabinet resolution (passed in 2016) which imposes fees
on the telecommunications sector. This could raise significant revenue (up to 10–12
percent of tax revenue). In addition, the FGS is expected to generate some fiscal savings
from the implementation of the new payment process.



On the other hand, revenue collection efforts could be impacted by the weak security
and governance conditions.



Should downside risks materialize, to keep the program on track, staff agreed with the
authorities to consider the following measures: (1) cutting non-priority spending on
goods and services; and (2) use any buffers arising from improved PFM to safeguard
against revenue shortfall.

Modification of SB on currency reform. The CBS has endorsed a new roadmap for currency
reform (¶21 and Box 1) in which two QBs—a ceiling on issuance of banknotes other the SOS
1,000 and a ceiling on issuance of SOS banknotes that are not backed by foreign assets—are
scheduled to be completed after July 2017 (that is, beyond the SMP period).20 The authorities
and staff agreed to propose a new SB to (“finalize the anti-counterfeit strategy by the end of
March 2017”21), which is part of the currency reform roadmap.

20

At the time of the SMP approval, the authorities adopted a guiding principle for a currency reform roadmap
involving two phases. In the first phase (spanned through mid-2017, that is during the SMP period), the CBS
would issue new SOS 1,000 banknotes whose value would not exceed the U.S. dollar assets on the balance sheet
of the CBS. During the second phase, the CBS would issue higher SOS banknote denominations.
21

Significant progress has been made in drafting anti-counterfeit measures. For example, the CBS is in the
process of finalizing regulation establishing a National Anti-Counterfeit Center. In addition, the CBS is drafting a
MoU on cooperation between the CBS and the Somali police.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

14.
The authorities and staff discussed risks to the program, program prospects, and
Somalia’s future engagement with the IMF.


Risks. The authorities shared staff’s assessment that while the uncertainties outlined in
¶9 and Box 2 will continue to be risks to the program, the cabinet reshuffle following the
presidential elections could also challenge the implementation of the program. They also
acknowledged that in the absence of appropriate corrective measures, fiscal risks could be
higher. The authorities are, however, cognizant that strong commitment to the program, and
sustained and coordinated international support—including with regards to security, peace,
and capacity building—would help mitigate risks. As the FGS fiscal stance depends largely on
donor inflows, other risks include persistent delays and revisions in grant disbursements.
These could lead to arrears accumulation or cash rationing. The authorities and staff agreed
that the corrective measures discussed to avoid arrears and delay payments could help
mitigate such a risk. The authorities further stressed that donors’ pledged grants disbursed
on schedule would help avoid arrears and limit delayed payments. On the positive side, tax
revenue collection could surprise on the upside (¶13).



Program prospects. As the SMP will end in April 2017, discussions laid the groundwork for a
successor SMP. The authorities and staff agreed to the measures for the fiscal and financial
sectors outlined in ¶18 and MEFP ¶13; and ¶21 and MEFP ¶15, respectively. The repeated
delays in the elections have affected the 2017 budget schedule (now expected to be
approved by March 2017). Staff stressed that the completion of the second review hinges on
the new authorities’ commitment to the implementation of policies agreed on and Somalia’s
capacity to enforce existing laws, particularly on tax administration and tax collection.
Lessons from this SMP and prioritization of the identified fiscal and financial sector measures
will be discussed at the time of the second review. The second and final review of the SMP is
expected to be completed by June 2017.



Somalia’s future engagement with the IMF. While the authorities and some donors are
pushing for a quicker move for IMF financing support, staff explained that only after
establishing a strong economic track record (successfully completing this, and subsequent,
SMPs) and the clearance of arrears to the Fund,22 will Somalia be eligible for an IMF Upper
Credit Tranche (UCT) facility.

22

The clearance of arrears will be an important part of normalizing relations with the international community
and establishing a roadmap to debt sustainability. The process will involve: (1) establishing a track record of
cooperation with the Fund on policies and payments, including in the context of SMPs; (2) reconciling external
debt; (3) preparing a poverty reduction strategy; and (4) mobilizing donor resources to finance debt relief under
the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
Discussions focused on critical near-term policy challenges:23 (1) improving fiscal policy and
reforms, budget execution, and revenue mobilization; and identifying contingent measures to
avoid new arrears; (2) instituting reforms toward Somalia’s national currency and prepare for
effective monetary policy over the medium term; (3) developing the financial sector; (4) the
national development plan (NDP) and social safety net; (5) the economic implications of
repatriating Somali refugees; (6) remittances and money transfer businesses; and
(7) strengthening institutions and governance, as well as rebuilding macroeconomic statistics.

A. Fostering Fiscal Discipline
Background
15.
The 2017 fiscal framework is underpinned by stronger tax revenue mobilization
(Text Table 2).24 Projections will continue to be based on a zero-cash balance and no
accumulation of new domestic arrears (as required under the SMP). Revenue and grants are
projected to reach 3.8 percent

23

Somalia’s macroeconomic and financial data are rudimentary, the economy remains highly fragile, and the
entire economy is in need of rebuilding. As such, the authorities and staff agreed to focus the discussions on the
near-term challenges.
24

The 2017 projection is in line with the draft 2017 budget, which has yet to be endorsed by the Minister of
Finance, approved by the Cabinet, and is expected to be adopted by the Parliament by March 2017. For the first
three months of 2017, the authorities will operate on extended 2016 budget.

package of tax policy and tax administration measures agreed to with the authorities, the tax
measures will generate $43.0 million. Grants projection is conservative and based on
confirmed grants from traditional donors.


Revenue from telecommunication sector (Text Table 3). The authorities aim to collect
about $24.5 million in tax revenues from the telecommunication sector in 2017 (19.2 percent
of tax revenue), up from the negotiated tax of $5.0 million collected in 2016. The projection
comprises about $12–14 million from taxes on corporate profits and $10–12 million from
sales taxes. Revenue from income taxes on telecom employees’ salaries is not accounted for
at this point; but could also come on stream later in 2017, representing an upside potential
to 2017 revenues (see Box 3). Additional revenue collection from the telecom sector could be
achieved but will require significant improvements in revenue administration and tax
collection, while improving security for telecom operators.



Expenditure. Expenditure projection is aligned with revenue. It allows for a zero-cash
balance and accommodates a buffer to absorb deferred payments of salaries from 2016
amounting to $22.9 million.25 The wage bill ($121.8 million) accounts for the full-year
payment of civil servants and security forces and the salaries for the new Senate members.
Increases for non-wage recurrent spending and investment will support the efforts to rebuild
institutions and public infrastructure.

16.
Significant progress has been made toward rebuilding Somalia’s external debt
statistics (Table 5a and 5b). With technical assistance (TA) from the African Development Bank
(AfDB), the Debt Management Unit (DMU) has reconstituted the bulk of the country’s external
debt database either lost or destroyed during the conflict. Based on information through-end
October 2016, from more than two-thirds of Somalia's creditors, outstanding public debt was
estimated to be over $5 billion (nearly 80 percent of GDP), of which $4.7 billion in arrears
(74 percent of GDP). In 2016, the debt comprises multilateral creditors ($1.4 billion or
22.9 percent of GDP), Paris Club creditors ($2.3 billion or 36.6 percent of GDP), and some nonParis Club creditors ($1.3 billion or 20.5 percent of GDP).

Policy discussions
17.
To achieve the fiscal targets for 2017, the authorities agreed on the need for:
(1) strengthening fiscal discipline and improving budget execution; (2) implementing strong
reform measures to tax law enforcement and improving revenue collection; and (3) following
through with the expenditure prioritization rules. In this regard, they agreed to set a more
realistic budget underpinned by a broader revenue base, conservative grants, and a prudent
expenditure policy. Revenue windfalls (including additional grants for budgetary support) would

be used to build up buffers (for contingent measures, including inflows of refugees) and pay
down arrears. The authorities agreed that priorities should focus (MEFP, ¶12):

On tax policy and reforms, the authorities and staff reached an understanding on the need



On expenditure policy and reforms, the authorities are taking steps to enforce stronger
fiscal discipline. These efforts include mainly cap on staff numbers set at the 2016 budget
levels and a task force led by the Prime Minister to fully review the existing recruitment
policies and examine the disparity between parliamentarian and civil service compensation
levels. Also, to improve accountability and transparency, line ministries’ spending will be
aligned with the budget and off-budget grants will be published in an addendum to the
budget.

The projection conservatively assumes a revenue-base of the telecommunication sector of $96 million.

Box 3. Somalia: Illustrating Potential Revenue from the Telecoms Sector
Revenue from telecoms could be increased sharply. In the absence of formal taxation, the sector’s
contribution to the budget amounts to about $5 million in negotiated monthly fees and taxes (about
5.6 percent of 2016 projected tax revenue). At the same time, the sector’s total annual revenues could
amount to over $220 million according to the authorities (3.5 percent of projected 2016 GDP). Increased
revenue generation would require more formal taxation and regulation, but also improved provision of
public services to incentivize voluntary payment. For example, telecom companies currently provide their
own security to guard their infrastructure.
An expert’s report commissioned by the authorities estimated that annual revenue generation could
range between $81 and $119 million (see Table).1
These estimates are based on a population size of
10 million and peer-group comparable rates of
penetration and per capita revenues that suggest
sector-wide annual revenues of around $220 million.
The revenue estimate is based on several taxes and
fees, including a corporate tax, payroll-tax, a valueadded tax, and fees on licensing and spectrum access.
Importantly, several revenue sources are excluded due
to the nascent development of the sector and
government institutions. These include mobile money
service fees (important in Somalia), fees from fixed line
and broad-band services, and rent on public land, and
taxes on handsets, which could also represent future
revenue measures.
The authorities are targeting to collect about
$24.5 million in taxes from the telecom sector,
including $12–14 million from corporate profits and
the rest from sales taxes. The authorities’ new
revenue measures are based on an annual telecom
sector revenue estimate of $96 million, a sales tax of 15
percent and implementation of the new measures by

18.
The authorities recognized that Somalia’s fiscal policy framework needs to be
strengthened considerably. To address the weak revenue base, volatile grants, and serious
shortcoming in public financial management (PFM), they intend to implement a number of
reform measures (MEFP, ¶13–15):


Improving revenue administration and mobilization. 27 The need to lift the FGS tax level is
a high priority. 28 The authorities are planning to introduce a modern system of taxpayer
registration, strengthen audit and enforcement, while improving tax compliance. This also
includes expanding the tax base, plans to harmonize customs’ entry point across the country,
as well as Inland Revenue Department and Customs administration.



Improving treasury management. This is critical for the effectiveness and credibility of the
fiscal framework and the authorities will step up efforts to: (1) strengthen the TSA; (2)
improve cash management; (3) operationalize the management of commitments and arrears;
and (4) complete electronic payments.



Strengthening fiscal federalism (Box 4). The authorities agreed to step up their efforts to
improve the central-subnational fiscal coordination and achieve state-level consensus on
issues related to fiscal federalism. They recognized that the slow progress on fiscal federalism
undermines the FGS revenue stream and the country’s development process. They concurred
that the near-term focus should be on issues related to revenue sharing and harmonizing the
FGS and state PFM systems, including revenue policies and expenditure responsibilities.

19.
On debt policy, staff stressed the need to continue to refrain from external and
domestic borrowing—including from the CBS—while re-establishing relationships with
external creditors. In this regard, staff encouraged the authorities to continue strengthening the
DMU’s capacity while completing the public debt statistics (with TA from the African
Development Bank–AfDB). The authorities have reached out to external creditors and
reconstituted about two-third of their external debt database. They have also initiated efforts to

Box 4. Fiscal Federalism in Somalia: Challenges and Opportunities
Fiscal federalism is a near-term concern for Somalia. It is a viable vehicle for nation building. The scope
for fiscal federalism to help reducing poverty and addressing inequality in the distribution of resources is
substantial. For example: the heavy dependence on trade taxes puts landlocked states and states without
major ports at a disadvantage; less urbanized regions can raise comparatively less revenue from personal
and business taxes; and areas more often subject to droughts are damaged by the volatility of trade in
livestock, and suffer human losses that could be otherwise avoided. An effective system of fiscal federalism
can help to address inter-regional inequity, avoid duplication in government intervention, and improve
service delivery.
However, the establishment of a federal system is facing significant challenges.


Political. While a successful federal fiscal system in Somalia requires strong political support, the

authorities still need to decide on whether the federal system will emphasize the role of the federal
government or will give more relevance to local institutions. When the power to tax and spend is assigned
to local authorities, actions can be better tailored to local needs, responsiveness and accountability can be
strengthened. However, pre-existing differences across states can be difficult to resolve, unless states with
more resources voluntarily agree to share them with less well-off states. A centralized federal system may be
more efficient, and more effective in countries where capacity is low. If a well-designed transfer mechanism
is in place, a centralized solution can also reduce inter-regional inequality through fiscal transfers.


Economic. At present, the low tax base reflects the geography of the country, with each state

collecting taxes within its geographic boundaries. Absent an overarching legal architecture, individual states
have assumed full revenues as well as expenditures powers. And administrative systems and practices are at
different stages of development, reflecting in part the security situation. The balkanization of the fiscal
system represents a concrete risk, with harmful consequences such as heightening competition in revenues
collection (e.g. from the ports); increasing domestic trade barriers; and eroding the premises of goodwill and
trust upon which a successful federal system is built.
The authorities need to move swiftly to establish a federal system. It is critical that agreements on the
allocation of spending responsibilities, and the revenues authority between FGS and state governments are
reached, as the state formation process progresses. The authorities should improve the central-subnational
fiscal coordination. More specifically, this will include the development of the reporting framework between
the central and subnational governments and the formalization and operationalization of the centralsubnational dialogue on expenditure assignments and transfer options.

B. Strengthening Capacity at the Central Bank to Support Stability
The authorities and staff recognized that while currency reform is among the highest priorities
for Somalia, rebuilding the capacity at the CBS and reviving the financial sector are equally
critical.

Background
20.
The authorities have recently reached a number of milestones in reform
implementation (MEFP ¶7–8 and Box 1), particularly in the areas of: (1) CBS safeguards and
governance; (2) currency reform; and (3) the financial sector. However, the near-term challenges
ahead are daunting and include:


CBS safeguards and governance. On August 17, 2016, some high- and mid-level staff at the
CBS substituted $530,000 with counterfeit currencies (about 5 percent of the total CBS cash
in the vault).30 Following the incident, the authorities tightened their internal procedures.
They adopted a number of measures, including removing the Director of Operations and two
clerks from the cash operation department, appointing a new Director of Operations,
tightening the vault operations procedure, and introducing a new layer of supervision at all
times. The CBS continues to take measures to improve its financial reporting and accounting
practice.



Currency reform. Preparations are proceeding steadily with tangible steps already taken. In
particular, a fully-staffed cash management department has been reconstituted; a draft anticounterfeit strategy has been prepared, and the Board of Directors attended a seminar
regarding currency reform in May 2016.



Financial sector. The nascent financial sector is slowly being transformed (¶8) and important
reforms have been implemented in the past two years (Box 1). However, significant
challenges remain to reviving the financial sector, improving access to credit, and
safeguarding the remittances inflows to Somalia. The authorities agreed with staff that the
near-term key bottlenecks to financial development in Somalia include: (1) the absence of
financial sector laws, including outdated contract and property laws; (2) a poor payment
system and clearance house, and the absence of inter-banking system; (3) absence of a credit
bureau and consumer protection laws; and (4) the absence of basic consistent CBS and
commercial banks accounting and reporting, despite recent effort to improve financial
reporting.

30

This incident does not affect the Net Foreign Assets definition under the SMP (which excludes CBS cash in vault
denominated in foreign currency). The authorities have also indicated that the incident will not bear any fiscal
cost and will be reflected in the CBS financial statement as a capital loss. The CBS work with Somalia’s national
security agencies and the criminal investigation on this issue is still ongoing.

Policy discussions
21.
Staff welcome the progress made in reform implementation while noting that the
near-term challenges remain significant (MEFP ¶16). The near-term focus will be on:


CBS safeguards and governance. To avoid a repeat of the theft incident in August, the
authorities are accelerating the improvement of the CBS governance, transparency, and
organizational guidelines. These efforts include internal auditing, risk management,
compliance, and oversight. The authorities intend to build on recent achievements and to
address the near-term reform agenda on CBS governance and accounting. 31 A particular
focus will be on establishing an Executive Committee and an Audit Committee.32



Currency reform. The authorities reaffirmed that credible and successful implementation of
the currency reform hinges on careful preparation and planning. They outlined and discussed
with staff a roadmap for the currency reform focusing on: (1) finalizing the counterfeit
strategy; (2) deciding on the scope of exchange and conversion factors; (3) properly phasing
in the legal framework; and (4) initiating the preparatory work for storage, distribution, and
collection (including exploring alternative distribution channels, while closely considering the
geographical distribution of the Somali people). The authorities stressed that for successful
completion of the currency reform, adequate donor financing would be needed. Staff
indicated that the IMF stands ready to continue providing the needed TA to ensure a
successful launch of the new currency. The authorities agreed with staff that in near future,
the CBS will need to decide on key macro-critical aspects, including: (1) the exchange rate
regime to be adopted; (2) develop reserve management strategy; and (3) develop some
monetary policy instruments.



Financial sector reform. The authorities are determined to swiftly improve CBS and
commercial bank accounting and reporting standards in line with the provision of
international financial reporting standards (IFRS), while strengthening its oversight position
to arrive at full banking legislation, regulation, and supervisory rules for licensed institutions
(banking and non-banking), including enforcement capacity. In addition, they are
contemplating the preparation of a roadmap to revive an inclusive financial sector by the end
of April 2017.

31

Staff indicated that the IMF stands ready to provide support as needed, including by sharing international
experience and TA.
32

The World Bank is providing support for the competitive hiring of skilled bankers, including work on pensions
and severance packages.

C. Enhancing Inclusive Growth Amid Challenging Security Situation
The authorities welcomed the focus on: (1) the revision of the NDP; (2) the impact of
correspondent banking relationship (CBR) withdrawals and remittances; (3) how to absorb the
return of Somali refugees from Kenya; and (4) ways to improve financial sector development
and access to credit and to ensure the flow of remittances through MTBs.

Background
22.
Fostering inclusive growth will require bolder action in priority areas. The key nearterm actions in this area include:


NDP and inclusive growth. In addition to the institutional and macroeconomic policies, it
was agreed that, at current stage of development in Somalia, the NDP will underpin the FGS
development strategy by laying out the foundations for sustained and inclusive growth and
poverty reduction. The NDP will be critical for understanding the FGS development strategy
and garnering development partners’ support.33 However, the authorities agreed with staff
that the current draft has a number of shortcomings (MEFP ¶16 and Box 5), including: (1)
sectoral consistency; (2) prioritization of development needs; (3) mapping of costing and
financing; (4) a coherent safety net program; (5) a capacity development program; and (6) a
financial sector development roadmap.



Return of Somali refugees. This is adding another challenge with significant humanitarian
consequences. Somalia is also dealing with more than 1.1 million internally-displaced people
(due to persistent insecurity and drought), as well as large numbers of refugees, mainly from
Yemen. Additionally, the planned closure of the largest Somali refugee camp in Kenya
(currently home to about 425,000 people) in May 2017 (as announced by the Kenyan
authorities) will be even more challenging for the FGS (Box 6).34



CBR withdrawals and remittances (Box 7). Remittances amounted to about 23 percent of
GDP (average, 2013–15) and were, for the most part, received by about 40 percent of the
Somali population. The MTBs, which represent more than 45 percent of all financial sector
assets, channel inflows of remittances to the wider population. Although data are limited,
anecdotal evidence suggests that the withdrawal of Somalia’s CBR could significantly disrupt

33

The international community is preparing to provide strong support to Somalia through the NDP. In this
context, with the collaboration of the World Bank and the FGS, the UN agencies have developed a number of
Joint programs to support key institutions, and social and economic sectors under the UN Multi-Partner Trust
Fund for Somalia.
34

The repatriation could increase the number of skilled workers and small business entrepreneurs, thereby
boosting the fishing, farming, and livestock sectors.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SOMALIA

the country’s formal remittance inflows,35 as well as the balance sheets of MTBs. While no
data were available, staff were informed that the cost of transferring funds to Somalia has
increased.
Box 5. National Development Plan, 2017–19
The authorities are finalizing a draft three-year National Development Plan (NDP). The NDP will
replace the New Deal Compact which has served as the road map for peace and state building activities, and
will serve as the new vehicle for boosting growth and reducing poverty for the period of 2017–19.
The draft NDP covers several important areas. The NDP focuses on poverty reduction with the aim to
comply with the interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper and make progress toward the Sustainable
Development Goals (SDGs). It will also help enhance social cohesion and provide steps toward stronger
federalism. It provides a comprehensive diagnose of the Somalia economic and social conditions and its
broad objectives are well identified. In particular, the NDP intends to: (1) consolidate peace, security, and
rule of law; (2) build institutions; (3) lay the groundwork for the foundation for rapid, inclusive and
sustainable growth; and (4) restore and protect Somalia’s strategic infrastructure–transport, water, energy
and sanitation.
However, there are a number of challenges ahead of finalizing the NDP:


On policy and strategy: (1) the vision and mission should be clearly stated to avoid clashing priorities
among member states; (2) modalities of fiscal federalism still under discussion, the development needs
of different states are still unclear; (3) ensure that the medium-term strategy is consistent with sectoral
strategies; and, (4) ensure that the preparatory work is inclusive.



On financing: The draft NDP lacks discussions on costing and sources of funding and the need to
mobilize more tax revenue to support development and reduce heavy reliance on external grants.

Stronger policy support for the NDP will be critical. The momentum for the finalization of the NDP
should be maintained. The FGS is encouraged to increase consultation and engage in political buy-in for its
development agenda. Efforts should be made toward building a peer review structure and generating
international community support to ensure that the process is consistent with addressing poverty and the
wider promotion of SDGs. The NDP should therefore target economic growth through mobilizing
traditionally productive sectors and enhancing the private sector, while increasing the country’s fiscal
capacity. With the weakness in data sources in Somalia, it will be important to set appropriate procedures to
ensure assessment and monitoring of the NDP.

35

Anecdotal evidence suggests that the CBR withdrawal is constraining financial inflows to NGOs operating in
Somalia. In particular, regulatory pressure on some U.S. and U.K banks has led to termination of some CBRs with
MTBs.

Box 6. Closure of Somali Refugees Camp in Kenya––Some Economic Implications
The Kenyan authorities recently announced the planned closure of the Dabab camp, the country’s
largest Somali refugee camp. The closure of the camp which was initially announced for November
2016, has now been delayed to May of 2017. The delay does not affect the agreement by a tripartite
commission comprising the UNHCR, the governments of Kenya, and FGS to carry out the voluntary
repatriation of some 425,000 Somali refugees over a five-year period. Under this agreement Somali asylum
seeker will no longer automatically be granted refugee status.
The closure of the Dabab camp will significantly affect the Somali economy:


A number of non-government organizations raised concerns over downside risks, including an increased
risk to security, as well as potential increases in unemployment and poverty. In particular, a number of
returnees could be targeted as potential recruits by the militant jihadist group, Al-Shabaab, if the
repatriation process is not carefully considered and executed. The returning population will put pressure
on already scarce social services such as health, water, and education. Other risks associated with the
returnees include a possible worsening conditions of the internally displaced population which will
exacerbate the humanitarian needs.



Some anecdotal views suggest that there are some advantages related to the returning refugees,
specifically a potential boost in human capital. This includes the new skills that many of the returnees
have acquired, as some were born and trained in Kenyan schools. The increasing number of newcomers
will contribute to Somalia’s economic activity through self-employment, as some refugees ran small
businesses inside their camps. With some of the refugees hailing from productive areas of Somalia, their
return could spark the revival of the fishing and farming sectors. Those who have been historically
nomadic, meanwhile, will be able to integrate back to their nomadic societies, helping to boost the
livestock sector which is vital to Somalia’s economy.

To address the refugees challenges ahead, greater coordination and stronger support will be needed.
The Somali National Task Force on Repatriation estimated the Somali refugees’ repatriation cost at
$200 million. Without the support of international donors, a sustainable and durable solution to this refugee
crisis which could require some contingent fiscal costs for the FGS will not be manageable. The Somali
government will need to strategically plan for the resettlement of refugees and displaced populations and
to address this issue in its NDP. In order to embark on these actions, greater coordination with donors and
stronger political support will be needed from all regional administrations to face the resettlement
obligation in an unified manner.

SOMALIA

Policy discussions
23.
The authorities intend to revise the NDP to address a number of weaknesses in the
current version and continue to respond to the CBRs (MEFP ¶16 and Boxes 5, 6, and 7).


NDP and inclusive growth. The authorities plan to revise the NDP and address identified
weaknesses. In this context, they welcomed IMF support which will focus on: (1) the mediumterm macroeconomic framework; (2) sectoral consistencies; (3) the costing and financing
options of the NDP; and (4) institution and capacity development. They stressed that
increasing attention will be paid to enhancing economic activity by: (1) strengthening
financial sector reforms, including MTBs; (2) revising the NDP; and (3) improving the business
environment to unlock private sector activities.



Refugees. To mitigate the risks associated with the repatriation of refugees, including related
humanitarian and contingent fiscal costs,36 the FGS has improved collaboration with donors
and Somali states and regions, while designing a voluntary repatriation program which will
be in the revised NDP. They are cognizant that political consensus and donor support will be
critical for successfully returning this group of refugees in an orderly manner.



CBR. The authorities stepped up efforts to improve access to the international financial
system. In this context, while customer due diligence and third-party auditing of MTBs are
appropriate, the authorities acknowledged the need to strengthen the CFT legal framework
in line with the FATF standard and ensure that Somali financial institutions (including MTBs)
adhere to and effectively implement the AML/CFT law and guidelines.37 In addition, they
agreed that stronger collaboration between the FGS and the private sector, as well as
international partners, would be critical.

36

Given the size and forms of support from donors, the FGS’ main short-term concern is more humanitarian than
fiscal costs.
37

The Somali Ministry of Internal Security is drafting new CFT legislation. The FGS is also developing additional
CFT procedures and guidelines with the support of the IMF and the U.S. Treasury Department TA.

Box 7. Remittances and Money Transfer Businesses
The remittances of the Somali diaspora are large and significant. Official remittances from the Somali
diaspora are estimated to be about $1.4 billion dollars per year (average, 2013–15) and could be even
higher. This represents about 23 percent of the country’s GDP and is the major funding source for both
households and businesses. About 40 percent of Somalis rely on remittances for their daily needs.
Remittances also play a key role in the financing of Somalia’s trade deficits.
The absence of a functioning central bank has prompted remittance companies to work with little or
no supervision from the authorities. The culture of non-regulation has made international banks handling
transactions from Money Transfer Businesses (MTBs) uncomfortable due to risks and strong requirements by
their governments to tighten regulations. Over the past two years, banks in Australia, the United Kingdom,
and the United States have closed the accounts of some Somali remittance companies, citing legal and
regulatory weaknesses, as well as risks of money laundering with possible financing of terrorism.
Additionally, the lack of a proper regulatory framework could increase risks to money transfers to
Somalia. The inability to transfer money through the commercial banks will affect the transparency of such
operations from one country to another with increasing risks of MTBs resorting to other underground
systems. One of the major impacts of international banks suspending services to MTBs was the inability of
individual account holders and aid agencies to send money, which reduced incomes in recipient households.
According to some of the MTBs surveyed as part of an Oxfam report in the United States, this new regime of
regulatory caution has led to reduced volume, a rising cost of transfers, and increased informality among the
Somali remittances market. While no clear data provided by MTBs, fees and costs of transferring money
have increased, as has physical transfer of cash remittances.
Efforts are underway to improve the regulatory environment. An important step was achieved when the
Somali parliament approved the AML/CFT law on December 26, 2015. Implementation of the new law
should help in limiting the threat of CBR withdrawal and closure of the accounts of Somali remittance
companies by global banks. In addition, customer due diligence will be improved by recent efforts to involve
a ‘trusted third party agent’ with the assistance of the World Bank working with the CBS to monitor
transaction flows and provide independent third party audits of MTBs. The authorities are also in the process
of introducing new CFT legislation in line with the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) standards.
Policies to ensure a sustained inflows of remittances will be critical. A strong collaboration between the
authorities and private sector—as well as with international partners in working toward more transparency,
supervision, and regulation—will safeguard an uninterrupted flow of remittances, while restoring
relationships with international banks that work with Somali MTBs. Fundamentally, the authorities need to
continue to improve regulation and supervision of the financial system, which, as it develops, will also
improve transparency.

D. Keeping the Momentum in Capacity Building and Governance
Background
24.
The Somali authorities’ efforts to restore key economic and financial institutions
are proceeding well. Capacity development activity has intensified in the past two years (Table
7 and Box 1). Somalia is among the largest beneficiaries of IMF TA which is funded from a multidonor trust fund. The Somali authorities, however, noted that the needs for TA remain large and
addressing them will be essential for a successful SMP. They indicated that an increase in the
Fund’s TA to Somalia, in coordination with other TA providers, will significantly improve capacity,
empower local staff, and strengthen program monitoring.
25.
The authorities recognized that governance is critical for institution building. In
early 2014, they established the Financial Governance Committee (FGC) to advise the President of
Somali on progress on PFM action plan including on public contracts, concessions, and
procurement; and government assets recovery, as well as reforms at the CBS, and, recently, the
monitoring of performance under the SMP.38 In addition, at more regional and sectoral levels,
donors are supporting the “Strengthening Somali Governance” (SSG) project that focuses on
three objectives: (1) improve the legislative, oversight, and representational functions of
Somalia’s deliberative bodies; (2) improve the ability of targeted government institutions to carry
out essential functions; and (3) increase citizen awareness of and engagement in government
decision-making.

Policy discussions
26.

The authorities and staff agreed that TA delivery should be intensified.



Authorities’ views. They recognized that TA delivery is helping to address weak capacity
constraints, while supporting policymaking in Somalia (MEFP ¶20–22).39 However, to
withstand the near-term development challenges ahead, they have requested new TA (Table
8).



Staff comments. Staff indicated that the Fund TA will continue to be aligned with Somalia’s
absorptive capacity, the authorities’ program priorities, and the SMP’s objectives, Staff
argued that better coordination among the different TA providers to Somalia is needed,
including a more concerted demand-approach to improve the effectiveness of TA delivery. In
particular, drawing lessons from past experience and good practice, staff indicated that plans

The FGC consists of senior national officials and international experts (including from IMF and the World Bank)
and is chaired by the Minister of Finance.

On PFM, the authorities have ensured that they will follow through the PFM TA guiding prioritization outlined
in “Developing a PFM Reform Action Plan, 2016–2020” and endorsed by the FGS.

28

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SOMALIA

should be developed for each area of TA delivery and priorities should be identified and well
sequenced over time, in collaboration with the IMF.
27.
The authorities are determined to improving governance and institutions (MEFP
¶17–19). They are planning to reorganize the MoF, Ministry of Planning and International
Cooperation (MoPIC), and CBS, and strengthen key legislative and regulatory frameworks. This
will include reorganizing and re-enforcing key economic units (e.g., the recently established
domestic arrears management committee, national statistics, and debt management unit) and
departments (e.g., Customs, Inland Revenue, and the Treasury departments). In this regard, with
the passage of the 2017 Appropriation Bill which will endorse the tax code rate for income and
sales taxes, the authorities intend to introduce a more transparent regulation at the
telecommunication sector. The FGC will also continue to review large procurements and
concessions. Following the approval of the SMP, the authorities established the SMP Monitoring
Committee in July 2016 which has since produced monthly reports on progress under the
program. Also progress at the CBS is underway (¶20–21). Efforts to improve governance will
include the establishment of the anti-corruption commission. The authorities also intend to keep
up progress recorded under the SSG, including the monthly monitoring meeting.

OTHER SURVEILLANCE ISSUES
28.
Somalia no longer maintains restrictions under Art. XIV, and the exchange
restrictions and multiple currency practices identified at the time of the 1989 Article IV
consultation are no longer in effect. Staff encouraged the authorities to consider at some
point initiating the necessary steps for the country to accept its obligations under Article VIII. The
authorities and staff discussed the current exchange system and regulation (see Informational
Annex). Staff noted that, due to the absence of administrative measures controlling the level of
the exchange rate and the inoperative status of the CBS in the foreign exchange market, the de
facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a free-floating arrangement. While the Somali
Shilling is the official currency, the de facto currency in use in Somalia is the U.S. dollar. Most
transactions are settled in U.S. dollars and shillings are used for small payments (¶7). Residents
exchange U.S. dollars and shillings at a freely determined market exchange rate.40 Also,
neighboring countries’ currencies are used in border areas. Mobile phone payments, with
transactions denominated in U.S. dollars, are also widely used.
29.
Progress on producing FGS statistics has been slow and data provided to the Fund
have significant shortcomings that hamper surveillance (see Annex I–Informational Annex),
particularly on monetary, national account, price statistics, and balance of payments data.


40

Monetary data. The CBS balance sheet is incomplete and the commercial banks’
consolidated balance sheet is not yet available. IMF TA has intensified to improve the CBS
data reporting since the 2015 Article IV Consultation. Recent progress has included the use
The CBS also sets its own rate for accounting purpose but no transactions occur at that rate.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

29

SOMALIA

of U.S. currency for accounting purposes (instead of SOS) and timely reporting of CBS
financial statements (both balance sheets and income statements using QuickBooks).
However, despite improvements in timeliness and reporting, there are a number of
shortcomings stemming from weak data sources, insufficient coverage, and capacity
constraints. Finally, the CBS financial statements have yet to comply with the IFRS.


National accounts, price statistics, and balance of payments.41 Progress since the last
Article IV consultation has been very slow. A number of factors have limited IMF TA delivery
to improve the national account and price statistics since the last Article IV consultation,
including the long-standing new statistical law which has yet to be adopted by the
parliament, and delays in the production of a high frequency survey by the World Bank,
which only reached completion in September 2016.



Authorities’ views. The authorities are aware of the low quality data and pledged that, with
the intensification of TA delivery, data provision will continue to improve under the SMP.
They also explained that the delay in the passage of the new statistical law was due to
circumstances related to the country’s presidential elections.

STAFF APPRAISAL
30.
Over the past five years, Somalia has taken important steps toward normalizing
relations with the international financial institutions. Despite these efforts, Somalia’s external
debt is high and virtually all in arrears, thus precluding the country’s access to external
borrowing. Somalia is also in arrears to the Fund and is therefore not eligible for financial
support from the Fund.
31.
Since the approval of the SMP in May 2016, the authorities have remained
committed to keeping the program on track. Staff welcome the significant progress made by
the FGS in implementing policy reforms recommended under the SMP and at the time of the
2015 Article IV Consultation.
32.
Notwithstanding the commendable progress made thus far, there are risks to the
program. The authorities and staff agreed that the risks identified—including security, weaker
fiscal position including low revenue collection, weak capacity, drought, and slow progress on
policy and reform implementation—could challenge the program implementation. However, a
stronger commitment to the program, and sustained and coordinated international support—
including with regards to security, peace, and capacity building—would help mitigate these risks.

41

Rudimentary current account data and lack of effective exchange rate data prevent a meaningful external
stability assessment.

30

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SOMALIA

33.
Improving fiscal management will be critical. To improve the credibility of fiscal policy,
greater fiscal discipline and enhancing budget execution will be critical. This will require adhering
to agreed measures to avoid arrears and limit delayed expenditure payments, while keeping
expenditures in check. In this context, staff welcome the effort to move toward the development
of a commitment control system and improve the TSA system. Staff also commend the
authorities’ resolve to improve revenue forecasting and prepare a realistic budgeting of grants.
34.
Step up efforts to mobilize tax revenue. There is significant potential to raise tax
revenue, notwithstanding the security uncertainties and poor governance. Over the medium
term, higher revenue collection will provide buffers against the volatility of budgetary grants, as
well as support the country’s development needs. Staff welcome the authorities’ plan to
introduce new tax measures in 2017. In this context, the passage of the 2017 Appropriation Bill to
endorse the tax code will be critical.
35.
Swift resolutions to address critical challenges at the CBS and the financial sector
will be essential. These include:


Currency reform. It is a high priority to limit the widespread prevalence of counterfeiting,
while restoring the credibility of the national currency. Credible and successful
implementation of the currency reform hinge on careful preparation and planning. In this
regard, it is important that the authorities follow through on the currency reform roadmap
agreed on with staff.



CBS safeguards and governance. The authorities’ responses to avoid repeated theft
incidents and their resolve to accelerate the improvement of the CBS governance,
transparency, and organization are welcome. In this context, steadfast steps toward
establishing an Executive Committee and an Audit Committee would be essential.



Financial sector. Reviving the nascent financial sector of Somalia will support inclusion and
economic growth. Staff welcome the authorities’ plan to prepare a roadmap to overhaul the
financial sector and improve the CBS and commercial bank accounting and reporting
standards.

36.
Improving access to the international financial system will be critical. Bringing the
AML/CFT law in line with the FATF standards and ensuring an effective risk-based
implementation will be essential for securing access to the international financial system, while
safeguarding the flow of remittances into Somalia. In this context, staff stress the importance of
stronger collaboration between the FGS and the private sector, as well as international partners.
37.
The authorities’ plan to revise the NDP is welcome. It will highlight the FGS policy
intention for inclusive growth and social justice, and build confidence and reinforce donors’
support. The NDP will become the FGS’ key development policy tool.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

31

SOMALIA

38.
Somali refugees’ issues are adding to the country’s many challenges. Staff welcome
the FGS strategy to strengthen collaboration with donors and Somali federal member states,
while designing a voluntary repatriation program to mitigate the risks and humanitarian
consequences. In this context, the FGS should continue to seek political consensus and donor
support for the successful return of refugees and the orderly resettlement of those who have
become displaced.
39.
Steadfast effort to rebuild key institutions and governance is required. The
authorities are urged to swiftly adopt the long-delayed statistical law. Reforms to build economic
and financial data to guide policies will continue to be tailored to institutions and capacity
development. In this context, the role of the FGC will be essential and progress in institution
building, governance, and organization at the Ministry of Finance and the CBS need to be
accelerated.
40.
Data provision has significant shortcomings. The database remains weak, particularly
in the areas of national account, price, balance of payment, monetary, and social statistics. While
data provision will continue to improve and TA delivery will intensify under the SMP, the
authorities’ sustained efforts to upgrade institutional capacity and legal framework will be
instrumental to filling the data gap.
41.
Staff support the completion of the first review of the SMP. In light of the broadly
satisfactory program implementation so far, remedial measures to address the missed target, and
the authorities’ strong commitment toward policy implementation under the SMP, staff support
the completion of the first review of the SMP. Staff also support the corrective measures to avoid
new arrears in the future and recommend the proposed two SBs to help improve tax collection
and strengthen the currency reform process.
42.
Staff will continue to support Somalia through policy advice and technical
assistance, particularly in the context of the SMP. This, and subsequent SMPs, are designed to
build a track record of policy and reform implementation, achieve debt relief, and allow Somalia
to graduate to the IMF Upper Credit Tranche facility. Staff recognize that this process will require
a concerted effort and continued policy commitments on policy and reform implementation,

Appendix I. Letter of Intent
Mogadishu, December 27, 2016

Mme. Christine Lagarde
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431 USA

Dear Madame Lagarde:
The Federal Government of Somalia (FGS) values the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) continued
support to Somalia through the Staff–Monitored Program (SMP) and technical assistance. Since the
approval of the SMP in May 2016, we have continued to make efforts on reform and policy
implementation. Given the daunting challenges ahead, continued support from the IMF and donors
will be critical.
Somalia’s economic and social infrastructure was severely damaged by conflicts that lasted for a
quarter of a century. Since 2012, the FGS has embarked on an ambitious process of rebuilding the
state, as well as its economic and social infrastructure. Despite challenging security and economic
conditions, our efforts are bearing fruit. With IMF technical assistance and policy advice, we have
reestablished the core functions of our economic institutions, initiated reforms to improve our
macroeconomic management, and laid the foundation for economic recovery.
The Somali government remains committed to sustaining its efforts to rebuild the economy,
improve social conditions, and move toward normalizing relations with the international financial
institutions. In this regard, it has formulated a reform program under the SMP for the period May
2016–April 2017 that focuses on implementing prudent macroeconomic policies, including initiating
an important currency reform, while strengthening institutional capacity for macroeconomic
management. As described in our Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP,
Attachment I), our program’s objectives are to support economic growth by enhancing governance
and economic statistics, strengthening fiscal discipline, rebuilding capacity for implementation of
monetary policy, and fostering financial sector development.
To address the economic and social challenges Somalia is facing, the FGS has continued moving
forward by making tangible efforts in reform implementation supported by the SMP. The FGS hopes
that the successful completion of this, and subsequent SMPs, as well as building a track record of
policy implementation could, in the future, lead to an IMF-supported program of upper-credit
tranche quality.

46

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SOMALIA

The government is convinced that the policies and measures set forth in the MEFP are appropriate
for meeting the objectives of the program. We remain committed to the implementation of these
objectives and stand ready to adopt any additional measures that may become necessary. We will
remain in close consultation with IMF staff on the adoption of such measures and in advance of any
revisions to the policies contained in the MEFP. To facilitate the monitoring of the performance of
the program, the government will regularly provide IMF staff with all necessary information within
the required deadlines specified in the attached Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU,
Attachment II).
Finally, the government authorizes the IMF to publish this letter, the attached MEFP and TMU, and
the related staff report, including placement of these documents on the IMF website, subject to the
removal of market-sensitive information.
Sincerely yours,

/s/

Attachment I. Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies
(MEFP)
This memorandum reviews recent economic developments and outlines our policies and reforms for
2017—19 in regard to Somalia’s Staff-Monitored Program (SMP) with the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) for the 12-month period, May 2016—April 2017.

A. Background
1.
Somalia is a fragile state emerging from decades-long civil war. In 1991, armed
opposition groups toppled the government, resulting in a protracted civil conflict and the implosion
of the central government. Nearly 25 years later, a provisional constitution was adopted in
August 2012 and elders across the country elected a 275-member Federal Parliament. In
September 2012, Parliament elected Mr. Hassan Sheikh Mohamud as President, leading to the
formation of the Federal Government of Somalia (FGS) in October. The FGS was subsequently
formally recognized and reengaged with the International Financial Institutions. The formation of all
federal member states was concluded in October 2016 laying down the foundations for federalism.
2.
Since the approval of the SMP in May 2016, the government has taken important steps
to rebuild the country’s economic institutions. Somalia now has functioning key administrative
institutions, a Cabinet, and FGS agencies and federal member states administration that have been
working together, including in developing the economic infrastructure of Somalia. Although these
institutions need substantial human and technical capacity, significant progress has been achieved in
building the institutional framework and in preparing basic macroeconomic statistics.
3.
Because of the protracted conflict, however, state institutions remain weak, the
economy is severely underdeveloped, and poverty is pervasive. The legacy of the destruction of
both physical infrastructure and human capital will continue to limit Somalia’s growth potential for
long. Weak capacity in government institutions and shortages in accurate and timely statistics
hamper policy formulation and implementation. Moreover, a generation where non-payment of
taxes was the norm, and the lack of policy consensus on fiscal federalism pose challenges to revenue
mobilization and weaken the ability of the FGS to support economic activity. Nevertheless, the
reestablishment of the basic functions of the country’s economic institutions, aided by the
international community, provides us with an opportunity to improve macroeconomic management
and rebuild institutional capacity.

Our program aims to facilitate economic recovery and improve the livelihoods of the
Somali people. To this end, we will embark on policies and reforms to strengthen our fiscal
framework, rebuild the financial system, and improve governance. The SMP, in support of our
program, while establishing a policy implementation track record as an important step toward an
eventual Fund arrangement, will also facilitate Somalia’s re-engagement with the international
community, including the international financial system.

B. Recent Economic and Financial Developments
5.
Notwithstanding capacity constraints, the policies undertaken in recent years have
supported macroeconomic stability. Economic growth recovered to about 3.5 percent in 2014–16
and inflation remained low. However, reflecting mainly revenue shortfalls and delays in pledged
budget support, budget execution has been difficult.
6.
The government has consistently improved fiscal, financial, and statistical institutions
and capacities.


On fiscal measures, we started training the staff of tax-collecting agencies in the area of tax
and customs administration. On public financial management (PFM), the government has
approved a new PFM law, introduced an electronic system for paying the salaries of civil
servants, submitted the 2015 financial statements to the auditor general, and phased in the
implementation of the Somalia Financial Management Information System (SFMIS). At the same
time, the implementation of the commitment system and related payment reforms, including a
Treasury Single Account (TSA) are well advanced.



On financial sector measures, to enhance the governance of the Central Bank of Somalia (CBS),
its Board of Directors has approved new by-laws and regulations to safeguard the autonomy
and accountability of the Central Bank, including: (1) setting up an audit committee to report
directly to the Board of Directors; (2) establishing an Internal Audit Department reporting to the
Governor; and (3) the auditing of the 2014 CBS financial statements, which is in progress. On
currency reform, the CBS has reconstituted a fully staffed cash management department and
prepared a draft anti-counterfeit strategy.



On governance and transparency, we have strengthened the legislative framework with key
legislation passed by Parliament, including the Foreign Investment Law, Anti-Money Laundering
(AML) Law, the Audit Law, and the Procurement Law. We received training to assist the CBS to
build confidence in the payment system, and safeguard the continued flow of international
remittances to Somalia and to work with MTBs on anti-money laundering and combating the
financing of terrorism (AML/CFT). We established the National Anti-Money Laundering
Committee (NAMLC) to oversee the efforts of the Federal Government of Somalia in monitoring
transactions. The Financial Reporting Center was established to liaise and directly work with
financial institutions, including MTBs, to receive and analyze information concerning money
laundering and terrorism financing. We established the National Interim Procurement Board to
review large concession contracts and ensure transparency.



On capacity development, we have intensified staff training at the Ministry of Finance (MOF),
CBS, and Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation (MOPIC), delivered by both
multilateral organizations and bilateral donors. In this regard, we benefited from more than
60 IMF technical assistance missions and workshops over the past two years.

C. Program Performance
7.

Program performance under the SMP has been satisfactory.



The government has met all SMP indicative quantitative targets for June 2016 and the structural
benchmark (SB) target (The Minister of Finance to approve the 2016–20 PFM reform action plan)
was also met.



Six out of seven quantitative performance indicator targets for the first review (end-September,
Table 1) were met. However, due mainly to the delayed disbursement of budgetary grants by
two bilateral donors, new budgetary arrears of $10 million were accumulated through the end of
September, but were settled in November. We remain confident that the following measures will
help avoid future arrears: we will (1) continue to improve budget execution, through prioritizing
the payment of salaries to Ministries, Departments, and Administrations (MDAs), (2) adhere
strictly to the new arrears management strategy; and (3) increase the realism of our revenue and
grant forecasts and take steps to improving domestic revenue mobilization, including greater
tax collections.



The government has met all the SBs set for the first review (end-September, Table 2). The newlyestablished SMP Committee will monitor progress in the implementation of policy measures
spelled out in the MEFP: (1) the Ministry of Finance has prepared a plan to identify existing
domestic arrears and a payment schedule; and (2) the MOPIC is strengthening the recently
established business registry to support the collection of macroeconomic statistics. However,
this process would be completed upon the passage of the new Statistical Law which would
include articles on statistical system, statistical confidentiality, cooperation between state
agencies and data sharing. Also, the government is making progress on completing an action
plan to improve cash management and on a plan to modernize revenue and customs
administration (both SBs for March 2017).



The government is keeping the reform momentum and has completed a number of structural
measures set for the second review (test date: end-March 2017), including: the completion of a
report on the process and design of an electronic payment system for the Somali National Army
and Police, complete with biometric screening capability, is on track (set for December); and the
issuance of a Prime Ministerial decree that requires all foreign grant agreements to be cosigned
by the Minister of Finance (set for March 2017) has been completed.



Progress has been made on advancing the implementation of reforms to the payment processes
necessary to achieving 100 percent of non-salary recurrent cost and reform financing (RCRF)
reimbursement (set for December 2016). A pilot program involving approximately ten MDAs is
underway to modernize payment processes, and commitment control will be made mandatory
for all MDAs starting January 2017. Furthermore, to address liquidity issues sufficient cash has
been reserved to meet the claims for payment from the pilot MDAs. These reforms will be key
for the success of the RCRF program to achieve the SMP benchmark.

D. Economic and financial policies for 2017–19
8.
Our objectives are to establish the building blocks for macroeconomic stability and
economic recovery. Therefore, our program focuses on building a sound framework for
macroeconomic management, notably strengthening PFM, creating a modern tax and customs
administration, following through measures outlined in the arrears management strategy to avoid
future arrears, continuing national currency reform, and improving the licensing and supervision of
financial institutions to foster confidence in commercial banks and money transfer businesses
(MTBs). Program design recognizes our limited institutional capacity, and envisages capacity
building as an essential component. Furthermore, we are preparing a national development plan
(NDP), which is compliant with the Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, for the period 2017–19
to guide delivery of aid.
9.
Economic recovery is expected to resume in 2018-19 after slowdown in 2017. Growth is
projected to decelerate to 2.0–2.5 percent and inflation to tick up to 2.7–3.0 percent in 2017
Thereafter, growth is expected to recover to 3.5–4.5 percent in 2018–19. The weak growth rate in
2017 reflects mainly the impact of the drought on the agriculture sector. Nonetheless, the
construction, telecommunications, and service sectors will remain the engines of growth. We will not
allow the net foreign assets (as defined in the TMU) to fall below a continuous floor. Given the
reality of very low foreign reserves, the CBS will use recovered CBS foreign assets to increase its net
foreign reserves. While the trade balance is projected to remain large, we expect remittances and
grants to continue to cover the deficit.
10.
Our program will lay the foundation for sound macroeconomic management. It focuses
on: (1) developing and maintaining a fiscal framework consistent with a zero-cash balance, while
avoiding arrears accumulation and improving budget execution; (2) improving PFM; (3) raising
revenue; (4) continuing the national currency reform; (5) improving commercial banks and MTBs
regulation, and licensing and supervision; (6) facilitating remittances to Somalia; and (7) developing
a statistical system.

Fiscal Policy and Reforms
11.
Our fiscal framework for 2017–19 aims at strengthening the role of the budget as a
policy tool. In line with the SMP, the 2017 budget will target a zero-cash balance. Any revenue
(including budgetary grants) windfall will be used to build up buffers for contingent measures,
including paying down arrears.


On the revenue side, in light of low domestic revenue and weak tax administration capacity, we
will continue to require donor grants (on budget) while abstaining from domestic and external
borrowing. The projected budgetary grants for 2017 will be based on confirmed and committed
pledges. The tax revenue in 2017 is projected to reach $126 million, up from $89 in 2016
(representing a 0.5 percent of GDP increase). This increase is underpinned by a reform agenda
aiming at replacing negotiated taxes with the existing tax law, and strengthening tax
administration:

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

51

SOMALIA



o

The tax policy measures will: (1) increase khat tariff from $2/kg to $3/kg; (2) double
the tariff on imported tobacco products; (3) harmonize visa charges and introduce a
departure tax; and, (4) increase the tariff rate on petroleum products by 25 percent.
In the telecommunication sector, negotiated taxes will be replaced by the adherence
to the existing sales tax law. By end-March 2017, we will pass the 2017 Appropriation
Bill to endorse the tax code rate for income and sales taxes. This measure will
broaden the tax base and improve revenue collection by implementing existing tax
law for payroll income tax and sales for telecommunications, electricity supply, water
supply, and hotel.

o

Tax administration will include tax compliance on income tax –on hotels,
telecommunication firms, financial institutions, electricity companies; sales tax
measures (on telecommunication services, electricity and water companies); a bed
tax on hotels; and an increase in the road tax compliance. Efforts to improve tax
compliance and widen the tax base will also include plans to modernize tax and
customs administration SB for end of March 2017, introduce a modern system of
taxpayer registration, strengthen audit and enforcement.

On the expenditure side, we will execute the budget in conformity with the Appropriation Law.
In the event of revenue or grant shortfalls, we will cut spending in conformity with the rules for
sequestering (prioritizing) expenditures, and, if required, submit a revised budget to Parliament.
Where possible, we will direct any revenue windfalls to the payment of arrears. Provisions for
arrears will be carefully managed to ensure settlement of current liabilities are prioritized.

12.
Our fiscal policy will be supported by near-term structural measures to strengthen the
foundation of fiscal institutions and policy tools (“getting the basics right”).


On expenditure management and budget execution, our near-term priority will be to pass the
PFM Bill and improve the government’s expenditure management. Enhancements of cash
management, payment processes, and public procurement are also underway. Moreover, to
tighten expenditure commitment control, we will provide quarterly allotment ceilings for
ministries, departments, and agencies that are in line with our revenue outlook. We will also
continue to improve the preparation of credible annual budgets and focus on accounting and
fiscal reporting, as well as external auditing.



On treasury management, significant progress has been made on some of these structural
reform measures including the development of commitment control system with a mandatory
roll out planned in January 2017. To strengthen the TSA, a stock-taking of the existing bank
accounts belonging to MDAs is underway resulting in the closing of non-critical accounts and
consolidation under the TSA. An action plan for the electronic payment system for the Somali
National Army and Police with biometric screening (PFM, SB #4) has been drafted.



On the management of arrears, we will update the arrears management plan to reflect
developments since October 2016 and establish plans to settle outstanding arrears.

52

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SOMALIA



On revenue, we will harmonize the custom entry points across the country in the medium term;
reform the Inland Revenue and Customs administration in line with the roadmaps currently
being prepared; and consider introducing a pre-shipment inspection regime for customs.



On fiscal federalism, we continue discussions with the federal member states toward
harmonizing taxes across sub-national governments, establish channels for intergovernmental
transfers, and define basic principles for a national fiscal framework.

13.
We will implement the remaining PFM and any additional reform measures agreed to
under the SMP, by end of March 2017 (Table 2). These include: (1) reaching 100 percent of nonsalary Recurrent Cost and Reform Financing reimbursement by the end of December 2016;
(2) completion of a report on the process and design of an electronic payment system for the
Somali National Army and Police, complete with biometric screening capability, by the end of
December 2016; (3) completion of an action plan to improve the policy and processes for cash
management function by the end of March 2017 (this action will involve taking stock of the reforms
and changes introduced with the assistance of development partners, including the IMF, identifying
weaknesses, and proposing an action plan to address them); and (4) completion of a plan to
modernize the revenue and customs administration by the end of March 2017 (this SB will be
achieved by establishing a modern system of tax registration and tax administration, including
assessment, audit, and enforcement).
14.
To lay the foundations for improving our fiscal revenue and to support credible
currency reform, we agreed with the IMF staff to add two new SBs. On fiscal reform, we will
pass the 2017 Appropriation Bill to endorse the tax code rates for Income and Sales Taxes (by end
March 2017) to implement existing tax law for Payroll (Income) Tax and Sales Taxes. On currency
reform, in line with our ongoing currency reform roadmap, we will “finalize the anti-counterfeit
strategy” (by the end of March 2017).

Financial Sector Reforms
15.
We will implement a package of reforms in 2017 to restore financial institutions and
the credibility of the Somalia national currency. These reforms will be centered on commercial
banks, CBS governance, transparency, and organization, and currency reform.


On the financial sector development, we will continue the overhaul of the nascent financial
sector by identifying the bottlenecks to inclusive financial sector development and financial
intermediation and define a roadmap for financial sector reform by end-April 2017. Meanwhile,
we will endorse the new regulation governing commercial bank branches and the commercial
banks asset quality classification and provision regulation. We will continue banks’ onsite
examination. We will also improve commercial bank accounting and reporting standards in line
with the provision of international financial reporting standard (IFRS), and strengthen CBS
oversight. In this context, we will: (1) prepare monthly financial statements of the CBS by March2017; (2) continue to strengthen the organizational and governance structure of the
CBS(establish an Executive Committee and an Audit Committee, finalize the terms of reference

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

53

SOMALIA

for main departments and the competitive recruitment with the World Bank Capacity Injection
Project, and completion on the “Core Banking” project with the World Bank support); and,
(3) implement new accounting and financial reporting systems and practices at the CBS.


Currency reform is a high priority. The economy is largely cash-based and highly dollarized,
and the CBS has not been in a position to issue legal tender currency since the early 1990s. As a
result, virtually all Somali Shillings (SOS) currently in circulation are counterfeit. In March 2016,
the Board of Directors of the CBS decided on the principles for currency reform in two stages.
The CBS has initiated technical work on comprehensive currency reform. A number of reforms
have been implemented since May 2016. We completed the currency reform roadmap in
November 2016 and we will strictly adhere to it. The roadmap includes the completion of the
following milestones by July 2017: (1) finalizing the counterfeit strategy; (2) deciding on the
scope of exchange and conversion factors; (3) properly phasing in the legal framework; and (4)
initiating the preparatory work for storage, distribution, and collection. We welcome the IMF’s
commitment to provide considerable near-term technical assistance to support our currency
reform. However, the CBS and the government lack the funds needed to finance this reform.
Grants from international donors will be critical not only for the procurement of new banknotes
on the international market but also for implementing this reform. We will also reach out to
other central banks for additional technical support and advice to underpin this necessary
project.



On other reforms at the CBS, the short-term priorities will focus on governance, transparency,
and overall CBS re-organization. On governance, we will initiate the internal audit, risk
management, compliance, and oversight procedures.

Policies for Growth and Social Inclusion
16.
The ultimate goal of our economic policies is to attain inclusive and sustainable
growth and to reduce poverty. In addition to the institutional and macroeconomic policies
outlined above, we are preparing our NDP which will underpin our development strategy. The NDP
for the period mid-2017–2019 will lay out our medium-term strategy to build the foundations of
sustained and inclusive growth and poverty reduction. We are committed to complete the
preparation of the NDP and submit it for Cabinet approval. During the preparation phases, we
identified areas need improvements in the current NDP draft and our work will focus on the
following critical issues and missing steps: (1) ensure that the underlying medium-term
macroeconomic framework is coherent and fully consistent with sectoral strategies; (2) ensure that
the preparatory work continues to be inclusive—in this regard, we will intensify our consultation and
cooperation with member states, as well as our international partners; (3) a comprehensive safety
net program to support the most vulnerable members of the population, including IDPs returnees
(to this end, we will work with the World Bank and the UN , who are already providing social safety
net program support to Somalia). In this context, the NDP will discuss the social and economic
implications of the repatriation of Somali refugees (from Kenya) and the Yemeni refugees living in
Somali; and finally (4) the NDP will outline updated plans to continue to rebuild economic and
financial data, and institutions. Based on the recently published World Bank and MoPIC Household
54

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SOMALIA

survey, it will also assess the current poverty outcomes and discuss strategies to achieve the
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs); (5) the NDP will outline the critical role of fiscal federalism,
including a plan to achieve it; (6) the NDP will discuss the objectives of the ongoing currency reform,
the need to restore the CBS and its monetary instruments, and development of the financial sector;
and (7) on financing, the NDP will discuss its costing and funding in coordination with donor
communities. It will also discuss ways to safeguard the Somali diaspora remittance inflows to
support economic development and social inclusion.

E. Governance and Statistics
17.
Enhancing the governance of key institutions is critical. The focus will be on reorganizing
the MoF, MOPIC, and CBS, and strengthening key legislative and regulatory frameworks. In
particular, with the assistance of donors, we plan to primarily reorganize and re-enforce key
economic units (including the recently established domestic arrears management committee,
national statistics, and debt management unit) and departments (Customs, inland revenue, and the
Treasury). Donors’ technical assistance is expected to provide guidance on best practices and an
appropriate regulatory framework.
18.
We will strengthen institutional capacity, enhance governance, and foster strong
private sector-led growth. We will establish the anti-corruption commission as stipulated in the
Anti-Corruption Commission Establishment Act, which is currently undergoing public consultations.
We will continue to introduce appropriate regulations for the private sector (for example, a law
governing the telecommunications sector), and formalize administrative procedures. Strengthening
fiscal governance is a priority as well. The Financial Governance Committee will continue to review
large procurements and concessions, and will play an enhanced role in reviewing progress in public
financial management reforms. It will also provide advice on asset recovery, the management and
disposal of Government assets.
19.
We will continue to rebuild our economic and financial statistics. In particular, we will
submit the new Statistical Law that establishes an institutional framework for data compilation,
reporting, dissemination, and sectoral regulation to the Parliament for approval. Further, we commit
to taking specific actions to improve statistical data by: (1) completing the list of business
enterprises that will form the basis for conducting statistical surveys to collect critical economic
statistics that will support broadening the tax base and developing FDI statistics; (2) collecting data
on the value and volume of exports and imports using internationally recognized systems and
improving coordination among statistical agencies at the Ministries of Finance, Commerce,
Transportation, and the CBS and MOPIC; (3) start collecting remittance data from money transfer
businesses (MTBs); and (4) re-establishing cooperation with the Immigration Department to collect
traveler data.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

55

SOMALIA

F. Technical Assistance
20.
Technical assistance delivery is addressing weak capacity constraints and supporting
policymaking. In recent years, a large number of our staff and institutions have benefited from
technical assistance supported by development partners. Technical assistance in 2014–16 helped the
Ministry of Finance to prepare a realistic 2016 budget. However, further improvements in the
consumer price index, gross domestic product, and external sector statistics are needed. With the
preparation of financial statements, the CBS is gradually restoring its credibility and capacity for
managing monetary policy. With IMF technical assistance, we also started enhancing the banking
regulation and supervisory regime.
21.
The government has identified the following priorities for technical assistance:
(1) internal controls, payments, and commitments; (2) cash management and the treasury single
account (TSA); (3) procurement; (4) accounting and reporting; (5) modernization of tax and customs
administration; (6) external auditing; (7) natural resource and concessions management;
(8) advancing central banking operations; and (9) building capacity for the production and
dissemination of macroeconomic statistics.
22.
During the program period, we are requesting IMF technical assistance in: (1) tax policy,
revenue, and customs administration; (2) budget preparation and execution; (3) reforms in cash
management and forecasting, and the TSA; (4) planning and implementing Treasury management
and reforms, including a GFS compliant Chart of Accounts; (5) internal controls; (6) fiscal federalism;
(7) bank licensing, supervision, and regulation; (8) currency reform; (9) banking operations; and
(10) macroeconomic statistics. We will make specific requests to the IMF for assistance. As we
advance on reform priorities, it is becoming increasingly critical for technical assistance to be
provided on the ground with access to expert advice and implementation support.

G. Relations with International Creditors and debt relief
23.
We recognize the importance of normalizing relations with international creditors. This
will in due course help address the burden of external debt and arrears. Given the urgency of
meeting Somalia's social and reconstruction needs, a substantial reduction in the debt burden is an
essential element of our economic strategy. Therefore, we will make every effort to establish a
sufficient track record of sound economic management with successful completion of this and
subsequent SMPs.
24.
We understand that Somalia is ineligible for financial assistance from the IMF, pending
the clearance of its longstanding arrears. We note that arrears clearance will be an important part
of normalizing our relations with the international financial community, and with the help of the IFIs
we are looking to establish a roadmap to public debt sustainability. We have also been informed
that the process will involve establishing a track record of economic management, cooperation with
the Fund on policies and payments. Going forward, we know that a successful completion of these
steps will, help Somalia move towards debt relief under the HIPC Initiative.

56

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SOMALIA

25.
Government records on external debt were lost or destroyed during the conflict, but
are being reconstituted. With technical assistance from the African Development Bank, our Debt
Management Unit (DMU) has engaged with Somalia's external creditors to collect loan information.
This has allowed for the reconstruction of about two-thirds of our external debt database and we
are still waiting to receive additional creditors’ information to finish reconstructing the external debt
database. We will continue to improve the DMU’s debt management and monitoring capacity given
its criticality for future debt sustainability assessment. In this context, we will monitor Somalia rating
on the Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) and Public Expenditure and Financial
Accountability (PEFA) and the Debt Management Performance Assessment (DeMPA).

H. Program Monitoring
26.
Our SMP Monitoring Committee will continue to monitor the implementation of our
program with the help of quarterly quantitative benchmarks (Table 1) and SBs (Table 2). The
program will have two reviews to assess its performance based on the test dates of September 30,
2016 and March 31, 2017. The quantitative benchmarks are defined in the TMU (Attachment II).

Attachment II. Technical Memorandum of Understanding
1.
This technical memorandum of understanding (TMU) sets out the framework for
monitoring the performance of the Federal Government of Somalia (FGS) and the Central
Bank of Somalia (CBS) under the 2016 Staff-Monitored Program (SMP). It specifies the
quantitative benchmarks on which the implementation of the SMP will be monitored. In addition,
the TMU establishes the terms and timeframe for transmitting the data that will enable IMF staff to
assess program implementation and performance.

A. Quantitative Benchmarks
Quantitative Indicators
2.

The quantitative benchmarks (Table 1 of the MEFP) are the following:
a)
b)
c)
d)
e)

Floor on the fiscal balance (on a cash basis).
Ceiling on accumulation of new domestic expenditure arrears of the FGS.
Ceiling on new domestic debt contracted by the FGS.
Ceiling on new external debt contracted or guaranteed by the FGS or the CBS.
Floors on CBS’s net foreign assets.

3.
Quantitative indicators have been set for the end of June 2016, end of September
2016, end of December 2016, and end of March 2017. All quantitative benchmarks are
cumulative from January 1, 2016.

Definitions and Computation
4.
For the purposes of the SMP, the government is defined as the Federal Government of
Somalia. This definition excludes public entities with autonomous legal personalities whose budgets
are not included in the Federal Government budget.
5.
Government revenue includes all tax and non-tax receipts transferred into the FGS general
accounts at the CBS and excludes grants. It is measured on a cash basis, and cumulative from
January 1, 2016.
6.
The fiscal balance, on a cash basis, is defined as the difference between: (a) the sum of
central government revenue (as defined in paragraph 4) and grants; and (b) total current
expenditure plus capital expenditure (excluding foreign-financed off budget investment).
7.
New domestic expenditure arrears of the government are defined as budgeted federal
government payments to residents determined by contractual obligations that remain unpaid
90 days after the due date. Under this definition, the due date refers to the date in which payments
are due according to the relevant contractual agreement, taking into account any contractual grace
periods.

Debt is defined for program purposes in accordance with Executive Board Decision
No. 15688-(14/107), Point 8(a) and 8(b), adopted on December 5, 2014.


For program monitoring purpose, the term “debt” will be understood to mean a current, i.e., not
contingent, liability, created under a contractual arrangement through the provision of value in
the form of assets (including currency) or services, and which requires the obligor to make one
or more payments in the form of assets (including currency) or services, at some future point(s)
in time; these payments will discharge the principal and/or interest liabilities incurred under the
contract. Debts can take a number of forms, the primary ones being as follows:
(i)

(ii)

(iii)



Loans, that is, advances of money to the obligor by the lender made on the basis of
an undertaking that the obligor will repay the funds in the future (including deposits,
bonds, debentures, commercial loans, and buyers’ credits) and temporary exchanges
of assets that are equivalent to fully collateralized loans under which the obligor is
required to repay the funds, and usually pay interest, by repurchasing the collateral
from the buyer in the future (such as repurchase agreements and official swap
arrangements);
Suppliers’ credits, that is, contracts where the supplier permits the obligor to defer
payments until sometime after the date on which the goods are delivered or services
are provided; and
Leases, that is, arrangements under which property is provided which the lessee has
the right to use for one or more specified period(s) of time that are usually shorter
than the total expected service life of the property, while the lessor retains the title
to the property. For the purpose of the guideline, the debt is the present value (at
the inception of the lease) of all lease payments expected to be made during the
period of the agreement, excluding those payments that cover the operation, repair,
or maintenance of the property.

Under the definition of debt set out in this paragraph, arrears, penalties, and judicially awarded
damages arising from the failure to make payment under a contractual obligation that
constitutes debt are debt. Failure to make payment on an obligation that is not considered debt
under this definition (for example, payment on delivery) will not give rise to debt.

9.
Domestic debt is defined as short-term and medium-to-long-term borrowing from
residents of Somalia, including the CBS. The definition of domestic debt excludes temporary
advances for liquidity management from the CBS, and domestic expenditure arrears as defined in
paragraph 6. Temporary advances will be fully repaid within 90 days.
10.
Benchmarks for external debt are cumulative ceilings on contracting or guaranteeing of
new nominal external non-concessional borrowing by the government from January 1, 2016.
External debt is defined by the residency of the creditor.
11.
The CBS’s net foreign assets are defined as the difference between the CBS’s gross
foreign assets and gross foreign liabilities. Gross foreign assets are defined as: (1) gold valued,

over the program period, at the market price of December 31, 2015 ($1,060.80 per ounce); plus
(2) foreign exchange (including recovered CBS assets, non-earmarked budget and earmarked donor
grants); minus (3) government budget grant deposits at the CBS in foreign currency; minus (4) other
earmarked foreign currency deposits by residents of Somalia. Somalia’s net position to the IMF is
excluded from the definition of net foreign assets. Gross foreign liabilities under the SMP are set at
zero. Relevant exchange rates against the U.S. dollar at December 31, 2015 will be used to convert
foreign assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars.

B. Program Monitoring
Program-Monitoring Committee
12.
The Somali authorities shall maintain a program-monitoring committee composed of
senior officials from the Ministry of Finance, the Central Bank of Somalia, and the Ministry of
Planning and International Cooperation. The IMF Resident Representative will have observer
status on this committee. The committee shall be responsible for monitoring the performance of the
program, recommending policy responses, informing the Fund regularly on program performance,
and transmitting the supporting materials necessary for the evaluation of benchmarks. The
committee shall provide the Fund with a monthly progress report on the program within four weeks
of the end of each month, using the latest available data.

Data Reporting to the Fund
13.
To allow monitoring of developments under the program, the Ministry of Finance, the CBS
and the Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation will provide to the Resident
Representative’s office of the IMF the following information contained in the data reporting table

Statement by Maxwell Mkwezalamba, Executive Director for Somalia,
Dumisani Herbert, Alternate Executive Director, and
Tanka Tlelima, Advisor to Executive Director
February 3, 2017
Our authorities highly appreciate Fund efforts towards normalization of Somalia’s
relations with the Fund, and other international financial institutions (IFIs). They thank
staff for the constructive discussions during the Article IV Consultation and SMP review
mission and are broadly in agreement with staff’s assessment and policy
recommendations.
Background and Context
1.
Somalia continues to face a difficult rebuilding process from two decades of civil
conflict, which is further complicated by the fragile security situation. The civil war has
not only destroyed the country’s social and economic infrastructure but has also impaired
the country’s ability to service its debt, comprising mostly of arrears. As a result,
Somalia’s external debt burden, estimated at about 80 percent of GDP, remains a key
binding constraint. In this context, approval by the Fund management of the StaffMonitored Program (SMP) in May 2016 was a key milestone towards normalization of
relations with the IFIs. The authorities are hopeful that their efforts will ultimately pave
the way for debt relief.
2.
Since the approval of the SMP, the authorities have continued to rebuild their
economic institutions. While significant progress has been achieved in building the
institutional framework and preparing basic macroeconomic statistics, more is still
needed in the form of human and technical capacity.
3.
Due to the protracted civil conflict, state institutions remain weak, the economy is
severely underdeveloped, and poverty is pervasive. At the same time, the lack of
consensus on the desired fiscal federalism poses challenges to revenue mobilization, and
weaken the ability of the Federal Government of Somalia (FGS) to support economic
activity.
4.
Against this background, our authorities will embark on policies and reforms to
strengthen the fiscal framework, rebuild the financial system, and improve governance
with the aim to facilitate economic recovery and improve livelihoods. Supported by the
SMP, the authorities’ program is aimed at establishing a track record of policy
implementation, which will serve as an important step towards an eventual Fund
financing arrangement.
Program Performance
5.
Despite facing immense challenges, our Somali authorities remain committed to
the SMP program objectives. All SMP indicative targets for end-June 2016 were met,
including a structural benchmark (SB) requiring approval of the 2016–20 public financial
management (PFM) reform action plan by the Minister of Finance. At the same time, six

2
out of seven quantitative benchmarks set for the first review, end-September 2016, were
met. The delayed disbursement of pledged budgetary grants resulted in accumulation of
new budgetary arrears amounting to $10 million through the end of September, but were
nonetheless settled in November. In addition, the authorities have met all SBs set for the
first review. Moreover, two out of three SBs for end-December 2016 have been
completed.
6.
Going forward, to avoid slippages and allow for timely remedial action when
needed, the authorities have established a new committee to monitor progress in the
implementation of planned reforms under the SMP. Meanwhile, to avoid accumulation of
arrears in the future, the authorities will use conservative revenue and grant forecasts, and
maintain tight controls on expenditure. In addition, they are confident that the measures
outlined in their new arrears management plan will help avoid future buildup of arrears.
Recent Economic Developments, Outlook, and Risks
7.
The Somali economy continues to depend on donor grants, and remittances and
investment by the Somali diaspora. Economic activity is projected to have decelerated
from 3.6 percent in 2015 to 3.4 percent in 2016. Further deceleration to about 2.5 percent
is projected in 2017. The slowdown in activity is attributed to the impact of drought on
the agricultural sector. In contrast, economic activity is expected to be stronger in the
construction, telecommunications, and service sectors. Meanwhile, inflation has remained
under control, although higher food prices due to the drought are likely to exert upward
inflationary pressure. At the same time, execution of the government budget was
complicated by delays in pledged budget support, which resulted in cutting of nonpriority spending and delays in salary payments. The trade deficit is projected to remain
large and financed by remittances and grants.
8.
The outlook for the Somali economy is subject to significant downside risks
emanating from both global uncertainties and domestic factors. In particular, external risk
factors have a potential to reduce donor support and remittances, which would have
devastating effects on the economy. On the domestic side, the fragile security situation on
account of terrorist attacks remains a major threat. However, the authorities are
committed to improving national security, with the support of the international
community.
Fiscal Policy and Reforms
9.
To achieve the fiscal targets for 2017, the authorities intend to strengthen fiscal
discipline and improve budget execution; continue to implement public financial
management (PFM) reforms and improve revenue collection; and maintain expenditure
prioritization rules. The budget process will be strengthened to ensure that expenditure
commitments are in line with available resources. In this regard, a realistic budget, based
on a broader revenue base, conservative grants, and prudent policy, consistent with a
zero-cash balance, will be set. In addition, attempts will be made to avoid arrears’

3
accumulation and any revenue windfalls will be utilized to build up buffers and paying
down arrears
10.
On the revenue side, the authorities will identify a set of realistic measures to
replace negotiated tax arrangements, and anchor tax collection more closely to the tax
base. To this end, they have commissioned a study, which has estimated up to $119
million potential revenue from the telecommunications sector, compared to $5 million in
negotiated monthly fees and taxes currently collected. In this regard, the authorities
intend to take the necessary steps to collect additional revenue from the
telecommunication sector, in the form of corporate and sales taxes, departing from the
current system of negotiated tax payments. However, the authorities understand that
progress in this area will require significant improvements in revenue administration and
tax collection, while improving security for telecommunication operators. As capacity of
the key state institutions is being rebuilt, more progress will be possible.
11.
On the expenditure side, the authorities are taking necessary actions to enforce
stronger fiscal discipline. Among others, these include a cap on the number of civil
servants, and a task force led by the Prime Minister to review the existing recruitment
policies and disparities in compensation levels. In addition, to improve accountability and
transparency, line ministries’ spending will be aligned with the budget, while off-budget
grants will be published in an addendum to the budget.
Strengthening Central Bank Capacity and Governance
12.
Our Somali authorities have continued to make considerable progress in
strengthening capacity and governance of the Central Bank of Somalia (CBS). Following
an incident of theft in August 2016, the authorities have moved swiftly to take corrective
measures. In particular, they are accelerating the reforms aimed at improving governance,
transparency, and organizational guidelines at the CBS. Specifically, these measures
include internal auditing, risk management, compliance, and oversight.
13.
Notwithstanding progress made in the implementation of reforms, near-term
challenges remain significant. One of the key priorities is currency reform, against the
background of a predominantly dollarized environment as a legacy of the civil war.
While there is considerable social and political pressure for the CBS to undertake urgent
currency reforms, the authorities are convinced that credible and successful
implementation of the currency reform hinges on careful preparation and planning. In
addition, adequate donor financing would be needed for successful completion of
currency reform.
Enhancing Inclusive Growth
14.
The Somali authorities believe that bold action will be required to boost inclusive
growth. In this context, the revised National Development Plan (NDP) 2017–19, which
addresses the weaknesses identified by staff, will serve as the new vehicle for boosting
growth and reducing poverty for the period 2017–19. In particular, the NDP will focus
on, amongst others, the following key areas: how to absorb the return of Somali refugees

4
from Kenya; remittances; and the impact of withdrawal of correspondent banking
relationship (CBR).
15.
The imminent return of Somali refugees from Kenya is expected to have a
significant impact on the Somali economy and the authorities’ capacity to provide basic
social and economic services. As recently announced by the Kenyan authorities, the
country’s largest Somali refugee camp will be closed in May 2017, which will result in
the repatriation of more 400,000 refugees. This raises concerns about potential risks
including increased unemployment and poverty. To mitigate the associated risks, political
consensus and support by the international community will be critical.
16.
Remittances from the Somali diaspora, channeled through the money transfer
businesses (MTBs), are a major source of funding for both households and businesses in
Somalia. Over the past two years, the key correspondent banks have closed the accounts
of some Somali remittance companies, citing legal and regulatory weaknesses, as well as
risks of money laundering with possible financing of terrorism. In response, the
authorities have stepped up efforts to improve access to the international financial
system, including approval of the AML/CFT law on December 26, 2015. Implementation
of the new law is expected to limit the threat of CBR withdrawal and closure of the
accounts of Somali remittance companies by global banks. In addition, customer due
diligence will be improved by recent efforts to involve a ‘trusted third party agent’ with
the assistance of the World Bank working with the CBS to monitor transaction flows and
provide independent third party audits of MTBs. Efforts are underway to introduce new
CFT legislation consistent with the Financial Action Task Force standards.
Capacity Building and Governance
17.
The Somali authorities continue to make progress towards restoring key economic
and financial institutions with support from IMF TA, funded from the multi-donor trust
fund. Capacity development activity has intensified in the past two years. However, the
need for TA remains large. Increased Fund TA, in coordination with other TA providers,
will be essential in further improving capacity and strengthening program monitoring. As
part of an effort to enhance governance, the authorities are planning to reorganize the
Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation, and CBS, and
strengthen key legislative and regulatory frameworks.
Conclusion
18.
Our Somali authorities are firmly committed to implementing their reform
program and advance the country’s development agenda. This will not only create
opportunity for the citizens, but will help in counteracting potential radicalization of the
country’s youth. The authorities are therefore determined to establish a sufficient track
record of sound economic management, supported by successful completion of the
current and subsequent SMPs. They, however, recognize the important role of the
international community and continue to appeal for a speedy process towards debt relief.
