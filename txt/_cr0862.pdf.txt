Staff Report for the 2007 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2007 Consultation with Israel
Approved by Michael Deppler and Michael Hadjimichael

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Economic growth and policies have been strong but vulnerabilities remain. There was
agreement between staff and the authorities on the major issues. The key points are as follows:
•

Economic growth is projected to remain strong in 2008, although less buoyant than in
the recent past. Domestic fundamentals are solid, except that capacity constraints are
beginning to bind and risk premia have increased. Slowing demand in partner countries
is expected to weigh on activity.

•

Interest rates would probably have to rise to keep inflation in the 1–3 percent target
range over the medium run. But downside risks to external demand and higher risk
premia argue for caution in raising rates.

•

The 82 percent of GDP public debt ratio is a key source of economic vulnerability.
Given that good times are expected to prevail, the central government deficit should
stay at the close-to-balanced position achieved in 2007 to support a rapid decline of the
debt ratio. This will require tight execution of the 2008 budget, which tables a ceiling
of 1.6 percent of GDP for the central government deficit, and allocating revenue
overperformance to deficit reduction.

•

The present rules-based approach to fiscal policy has served the country well and
should be preserved. An increase in the relatively low expenditure growth ceiling is
under consideration. Staff argued for anchoring a revised rule also on a 60 percent of
GDP debt objective for 2015. Achieving this objective would require maintaining the
close-to-balanced central government position through 2015. The authorities thought
that this was a realistic target that was consistent with higher expenditure growth and
would be considered.

•

Financial sector soundness has been improving and a more diversified and complex
system is emerging as a result of ambitious reforms. This will require a commensurate
strengthening of prudential policies and practices. Key are more scope to recruit highly
qualified staff; rebalancing activities from developing new regulation to on-site
supervision; taking a more principles-based approach to regulation; enhancing
collaboration between the supervisors, notably with respect to crisis management and
resolution; and formal independence for the insurance supervisor.

I. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
1.
Strong macroeconomic conditions and
sound domestic policies have significantly
improved Israel’s growth performance and
prospects but vulnerabilities remain.1 Amid
global financial market turmoil and heightened
uncertainty about growth prospects, the
discussions focused on external stability and the
exchange rate; financial sector vulnerabilities and
policy requirements; and fiscal policy, notably the
need to reduce the high public debt.

A. Macroeconomic Prospects: Strong but Less Buoyant Activity
2.
The economy is entering the global slowdown with significant momentum.
Notwithstanding the war in the north during 2006, real GDP growth averaged about
5¼ percent during 2006–07 (Table 1, Figure 1). Buoyant world trade propelled exports and
investment, fostering strong employment growth––which was also supported by welfare
reform––and private consumption.
3.
The global financial turmoil has caused some increase in risk premia but has not
prompted significant concerns thus far (Figure 2–3 Tables 2–4). Stock prices have been

provided losses on AAA-rated prime-mortgagebacked securities (ABS) remain limited.2
4.
Looking forward, activity is thus widely expected to remain strong, even if
somewhat less buoyant than in the past. Domestic preconditions for continued output
growth remain in place. Specifically, GDP growth is broad based; families’ real incomes are
rising, including those of the poor; corporate profitability and balance sheets have improved;
and the cooperation between employers and trade unions is good. Furthermore, the
economy’s competitiveness is still solid (¶7). However, capacity constraints are beginning to
bind (Figure 4), notably in the market for highly skilled employees; and risk premia on
corporate funding have risen. Also, external conditions are becoming less supportive. In
particular, decelerating activity in the United States and Europe will weigh on exports and
investment, although much hinges on the extent to which the external slowdown spreads
beyond foreign real estate sectors; and oil prices are standing some 40 percent above
2007:Q1 levels. Accordingly, the Ministry of Finance (MoF) and Bank of Israel (BoI)
foresee 4.2 percent and 4.4 percent real GDP growth, respectively, for 2008. Taking into
account the latest developments and prospects, staff projects 3.8 percent real GDP growth,
which is around potential, and an output gap that is estimated to be broadly closed.3
5.
Risks around the forecasts were seen to be broadly balanced. MoF staff felt that
their forecast was prudent, considering repeated upside surprises to growth in the past. BoI

Banks were instructed to disclose their holdings of US mortgage-related assets by September 30, 2007.
According to the disclosures by the largest five banks (which account for almost all banking system assets),
holdings of structured products, which are being hit by write offs, amounted to 0–12 percent of equity; those of
ABS that are not guaranteed by US government-sponsored enterprises amounted to 3-11 percent of equity for
four banks and 75 percent of equity for one bank (Hapoalim). All the banks have reported that they have no (or
minimal) exposure to sub-prime mortgages in their ABS portfolios. Hapoalim reported that 99 percent of its
holdings of ABS are AAA-rated. Mark-to-market losses on these types of assets have to date been modest.

This assumes steady-state productivity growth of 2 percent, with population growth at 1¾ percent.

5
staff explained that under an alternative scenario, with the United States experiencing a
recession, growth would still reach 3.6 percent. The authorities concurred that external risks
are tilted to the downside: partner demand might slow more than expected, global financial
turmoil might worsen and begin to affect Israel significantly, oil prices could exceed
projections further, and rising geopolitical uncertainty could adversely affect output. But
domestic risks are to the upside. In particular, despite unemployment rates nearing record
lows and wages accelerating gradually, capacity might be less constraining than estimated.
B. External Prospects: More Integration with the World Economy

2008. Staff sees the current account stabilizing at 2¼ percent of GDP over the medium run.
Multilateral calculations point to an equilibrium current account (“norm”) of about 1 percent
of GDP for Israel and suggest that the real exchange rate may be undervalued by 5–
10 percent, although the “norm” and the underlying current account could be closer
together.4 Consistent with such a view, the balance for goods and services has not moved
much during 2004–06 and market shares for goods have moved broadly sideways.

The authorities had no firm view on the valuation of the exchange rate. There
was agreement that domestic policies are consistent with external stability. However, the
authorities considered it difficult to determine the medium-run equilibrium current account
balance and exchange rate with much confidence. BoI analysis suggests that the former is
higher and the latter more appreciated than over the 1990s. Also, BoI representatives thought
that talk about under or overvaluation could prompt calls for renewed intervention in
exchange markets (BoI last intervened in 1997), which could complicate monetary policy.
The flexible exchange rate regime was viewed to be appropriate for Israel. Also, any
undervaluation would allow scope for nominal appreciation, which would help moderate
inflationary pressure (¶10).
C. Monetary Policy: Staying on Target Amid Exchange Rate Volatility
9.
Monetary policy has successfully stabilized inflation expectations, even though
inflation has frequently been outside the 1–3 percent target range on account of
exchange rate changes. Lately, inflation has been undershooting the 1–3 percent target,
largely reflecting sheqel appreciation against the US dollar, but is rising again. By
November, prices stood just under 3 percent above the end-2006 level (Figure 6), while the
sheqel (NIS) appreciated by about 6.5 percent against the US dollar (US$), which may have

7
lowered domestic prices by about 2 percent.5 As
the exchange rate prompted CPI deflation earlier
in the year, the BoI responded by cutting interest
rates from a peak of 5.5 percent in October 2006,
to 3.5 percent by June 2007. The rate cuts to
below the U.S. federal funds rate (an
unprecedented differential) contributed to
weakening the shekel. With inflation
reaccelerating, falling unemployment and rising
wage pressure, and some evidence of slowing
productivity growth, the BoI changed course in
August, raising rates in three steps, to
4.25 percent by January 2008.

run, with the policy rate rising to around 4.5 percent by 2008:Q4. Staff’s forecast based on
the WEO and other tools is for inflation of around 2 percent in 2008–09, assuming interest
rates rise gradually to about 5.0 percent by end-2009. However, the risks around this
scenario, particularly on account of the potential for a further appreciation of the exchange
rate, remain appreciable (Box 1). More importantly, there was agreement that growing
uncertainty about external demand prospects and rising risk premia in capital markets argue
for caution in raising rates.
11.
Staff welcomed steps to strengthen the transparency of the monetary policy
framework and discussed options for further improvements. The BoI is moving to
publish inflation reports on a quarterly rather than semi-annual frequency to improve
communication with markets. In addition, model-based fan charts of inflation and interest
projections have been added to the report. Staff welcomed these steps, but suggested
clarifying the role of the fan chart forecasts, which are not considered official BoI forecasts,
in the BoI’s decision making; the relationship between these forecasts and those for other
macroeconomic variables (notably the exchange rate); and the monetary policy horizon. BoI
officials were open-minded, but also had concerns about publishing a formal, full-fledged
inflation forecast. They thought that the volatility of the exchange rate and its high (although
weakening) pass through to domestic prices would limit the informational content of such a
forecast. Nonetheless, they stood ready to alter their communications, notably when
restructuring the BoI following the adoption of the draft BoI law.6

6

In December 2007, the MoF and BoI formally agreed on a new wage agreement that should pave the way for
passage of the new BoI law. For details on the law, see IMF Country Report No. 06/120, para. 23.

Box 1. Monetary Policy—Baseline Forecast and Risk Assessments
The central scenario assumes a small positive
output gap that is expected to close by mid2008. Under this scenario, and at an
exchange rate of about 3.9 shekel/$, the
policy rate would be expected to rise in order
to maintain headline inflation within the 1–3
percent band over the next two years.

D. Fiscal Policy
12.
The key challenge for fiscal policy is to keep the public debt ratio firmly on a
downward path. Public debt, which exceeded 95 percent of GDP in 2005, is expected to fall
to 82 percent of GDP by end-2007, still very high for one of the most vulnerable advanced
economies. The 2001–03 downswing––which resulted from a confluence of global and
security developments––is a stark reminder of this vulnerability, as the public debt ratio,
which had been on a downward trend since the early 1990s, swung upward by 15 percentage
points, to 102 percent of GDP. The Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) suggests that this
vulnerability remains significant (Figure 7, Table 6).
Near-term requirements
13.
Fiscal outturns have been much stronger than budgeted over the past couple of
years (Figure 8, Table 7). This is mainly because higher-than-projected revenue has been
allocated to debt reduction, but also because war-related expenditure has been offset through
expenditure cuts, contrary to budget plans to accommodate such spending. As a result, the
central government deficit has been kept well below the 3 percent of GDP deficit ceiling,
falling to 1 percent of GDP in 2006 and approaching balance in 2007.7
14.
The authorities are confident that they can stay on the path of debt reduction,
notwithstanding growing pressures for more spending. The central government deficit
ceilings are 1.6 percent and 1.0 percent of GDP for 2008 and 2009 respectively. The 2008
budget foresees no more than 1.7 percent real expenditure growth over the 2007 budget. In
110

argued that in the current period of good times a widening of the government deficit should
be avoided. Accordingly, revenue overperformance should serve deficit and debt reduction, a
message with which the authorities agreed.

The general government deficit is projected to fall to 1 percent in 2007.

11
Medium- and long-term challenges
15.
The current fiscal rule––specifically, the ceiling on real expenditure growth of
1.7 percent––is considered unsustainable, and a search for a new rule is underway. The
current real expenditure growth ceiling entails a continuous slimming of the public sector,
given the economy’s potential growth rate of 3¾ percent of GDP. There are complaints about
compressed welfare spending––nondefense spending is already lower than in many advanced
economies––and rising inequality/poverty, but there are also pressures for more tax cuts.

16.
The authorities are considering changes for 2009 and beyond, in the context of a
revised rules-based approach to fiscal policy. Staff advised anchoring a revised fiscal rule
on the objective of lowering the public debt to 60 percent of GDP by 2015.8 This objective
also featured prominently among plans under discussion in various quarters, including at the
National Economic Council, an advisory body to the Prime Minister. Achieving this
objective would require maintaining a broadly balanced central government budget, implying
general government budget deficits of about

consideration for the medium-run, and that they
would want to continue overperforming against deficit ceilings. Various expenditure growth
rate ceilings would be discussed, bearing in mind that further tax relief was desirable. Staff
underscored that debt reduction needed to be given precedence over tax cuts, considering
also that, unlike the debt, present tax rates are not out of line with those in most OECD
countries. Instead, efforts should focus on simplification of what is an overly complex tax
system, including by reducing tax exemptions (Figure 9).

Staff reiterated the need for more fiscal transparency and better governance. To
work well, rules need supporting fiscal institutions. For Israel, this means:9
•

9

Better budgetary preparation and transparency. Budget documentation needs to
include a multiyear scenario analysis of conjunctural and other risks for public
finance objectives. Such an analysis could help communicate the vulnerability of the
economy on account of the high public debt ratio.

For details, see IMF Country Report No. 07/25, Chapter I.

13
•

Stronger fiscal governance, including an institutional set-up to help monitor
independently the implementation of any new fiscal rule. Symptoms of creative
accounting to meet the current expenditure rule are beginning to emerge, although
they do not reach disconcerting proportions. Moreover, recent experience suggests
that deviations from rules might be necessary for a variety of good reasons that are
difficult to fully specify in advance. An independent and nonpartisan fiscal
surveillance mechanism could help address these concerns.

•

Improved long-term fiscal planning, including analytical work to better understand
long-run challenges. The growth rate of the labor force, for example, may well
decelerate from around 2½ percent per annum during 2000–05 to around 1½ percent
during 2010–15. Some projections suggest that by 2050, only about 2–3 people in the
workforce will support each retiree, down from more than 4 people today. These
developments have fiscal implications that deserve discussion.

18.
The authorities agreed on the usefulness of risk analysis and better long-term
planning. BoI has already begun to publish a risk analysis after the submission of the budget
to the Knesset, and to some extent performs the functions of a fiscal watchdog. The
government also considered various macroeconomic scenarios when preparing the budget,
although these had not been fleshed out in detail or published.
E. Managing the Transformation of the Financial System
19.
Financial sector reforms are spurring rapid change. Under the July 2005 reforms,
banks have been forced to divest themselves of mutual and provident fund management, to
foster a less bank-centric financial system. Also, the abolition not too long ago of the
obligation for institutional investors to hold fixed rate government bonds still reverberates.
The same holds for the end of the differential tax treatment of holdings of foreign and
domestic assets. New financial instruments have been introduced, including sale and
repurchase agreements. Further significant measures are planned, including increasing the
mobility of savings between different financial products and providers, the extension of
(plain vanilla) securitization, and the introduction of money market funds. A new
interministerial committee on capital markets has been established under the leadership of
the Ministry of Finance to plan the next stages of development of the markets.

The shared view was that these changes entail increased risk in the short run but
should make the economy more resilient in the long run. As a result of the reforms capital
markets have flourished, the role of banks in funding the business sector has declined in
relative terms, and that of institutional investors has increased. This is changing the nature of
financial risks:
•

Banks need to find new activities to substitute for old ones, while increasing their still
comparatively low regulatory capital ratios and this is likely to lead them into riskier
activities. Some, for example, are entering emerging markets. Accounting indicators,
such as nonperforming loans and capital adequacy ratios, suggest a continuous
improvement in banking sector soundness since 2002. Market indicators paint a
somewhat different picture, suggesting that bank soundness, after a substantial

15
improvement between 2003 and 2005, may have been retreating in 2006 and 2007.
This may reflect reform-related drops in franchise values as well as uncertainties over
the long run impact of global credit conditions.10 However, stress tests based on
publicly available data suggest improving system robustness, with credit risk as the
main source of risk (Box 2).11

•

Managed funds are rapidly increasing their holdings of assets with higher risk and
this requires a commensurate improvement in risk management capacities, even if the
risks are ultimately largely borne by households. During 2002–06, the public’s
holdings of shares and corporate bonds rose from 14 to 32 percent of all assets,
mainly at the expense of cash, deposits and government bonds. Concurrently, the end
of discriminatory taxation of investments abroad triggered sizable capital outflows.

•

Insurers’ business profiles are more diversified as a result of the recent reforms but
this is coming with new risks. The types of permissible activities have been relaxed.
Most significantly, insurance companies have acquired the largest share of the fund
management businesses which banks have been required to sell. As a result,
insurance firms and their affiliates are assuming new or enhanced risks, including
credit risk, with which they have less experience.

•

The changes in markets are temporarily stretching the resources of the authorities
both on the regulatory and the supervisory front.

10

Stock market indicators for insurance companies have weakened recently as a result of the latest market
turbulence, although not in a major way.

Box 2. Banking Sector Stress Tests

•

The main result of the tests is that resilience of the banking system has
improved. This reflects a combination of increasing buffers (improving
capitalization and profitability) with generally decreasing exposures.

•

The tests confirm credit risk as the main source of risk. Banks’ exposures to
direct interest rate risk are limited, as most of banks’ loan books are in floating
rates, and the duration of banks’ trading portfolios is relatively short. Banks
also have low direct exchange rate risk, reflecting their relatively low foreign
exchange positions, and their exposures to equity risk are moderate. Banks are
liquid at present, which was reflected in positive results of tests of the impact of
sudden withdrawals.

•

The staff’s tests were based on publicly available data. The staff encouraged the
authorities to start carrying out regular stress tests using supervisory data.

There was widespread agreement on the need to develop and implement
regulation to keep pace with changing risks and new international standards. The
mission welcomed the progress being made with implementation of Basel II for banks, more
risk-based approaches to supervision of banks, and improvements in disclosure and

17
enforcement of standards.12 Regulators have recently agreed on a Memorandum of
Understanding to improve exchanges of information and practical cooperation on initiatives

22.
The Ministry of Finance is reforming insurance regulation extensively in
response to the development of insurance companies’ business. The inadequacy of
existing solvency requirements has been recognized and proposals made to strengthen the
regime in the near future. Efforts are being made to improve the quality of the risk
management and controls of insurance companies. Risk-based supervision is being
developed.
23.
Regulators are seeking to improve the financial strength of banks and insurance
companies further to prepare for a possible economic downturn and coming regulatory
12

Progress has also been made on AML/CFT. A ROSC summarizing the findings of a Moneyval assessment
will be prepared during 2008. As a related matter, the authorities remain committed to ensuring a continuing
clearing function for West Bank/Gaza banks; however, there are concerns about the vulnerability for potential
misuse of the Israeli financial system that are in the process of being addressed.

18
change. The Bank of Israel has asked banks to increase capital ratios further in advance of
the implementation of Basel II, the impact of which on bank capital adequacy remains
unclear. Insurance companies are being asked to restrict the payment of dividends to no
more than 50 percent of income pending finalization of the new solvency requirements.
24.
The mission welcomed the improvements made to date but pointed to the
challenges ahead.13 Discussions covered five issues:
•

Of critical importance is the ability of regulators to build the expertise necessary to
support the more complex regulatory system now being put in place. This requires
greater recruitment flexibility and competitive pay scales, in line with the practice in
many advanced countries. The authorities explained that they had hired industry
experts on a consultant basis but agreed that this was not optimal.

•

There is a risk that the rapid pace of regulatory change will prove inconsistent with
high-quality implementation. Additionally, all regulatory initiatives carry costs to
consumers, firms, and regulators themselves. This calls for submitting major new
initiatives to cost-benefit analysis. The authorities agreed but expressed concern
about the resource implications. Staff explained that some rebalancing from the very
rules-based approach to a more principles-based approach by the authorities could be
helpful in alleviating resource constraints and also came with other advantages.

•

As increased competition brings more risk, there is a need for a strong capacity to
manage and resolve financial stress if and when it emerges. In this regard, the mission
welcomed the recent Memorandum of Understanding among the supervisors, which
includes provisions on crisis management. However, staff argued for further work,
such as exercises that test responses to crisis scenarios, to identify remaining gaps.

•

In line with good international practice, the insurance supervisor needs independence
to set solvency standards; enforce managerial changes in companies and resolve
failing institutions, as necessary; and powers to perform groupwide supervision. The
authorities agreed, but they thought that the legal process to achieve this was complex
and lengthy. Accordingly, they wanted to await a clearer vision of how to adapt the
structure of supervision to markets before proceeding on this front.

II. STAFF APPRAISAL
26.
The economy is performing exceptionally well but still high public indebtedness
calls for the continuation of the strong economic policies. While sound policies have been
central to the strong performance, so has unprecedented global growth. Moreover, with the
public debt today not much lower than before the latest recession and the country still highly
vulnerable to economic shocks, debt reduction remains the key macroeconomic policy
challenge. Welcome improvements to the financial sector framework also need to be carried
forward to enhance the economy’s robustness.
27.
Economic activity is likely to remain strong, even if less buoyant than in recent
years, and domestic inflationary pressure elevated. Domestic preconditions for continued
output growth remain in place, while external conditions are becoming less supportive.
Given continued solid growth and growing capacity constraints, inflationary pressures would
probably mount. Higher interest rates are thus probably needed for inflation to stay on target
over the medium run but external downside risks and heightened risk premia argue for
caution in raising rates.
28.
Monetary policy has successfully stabilized inflation expectations, but policy and
communication challenges remain. These stem largely from the high pass-through of the
NIS/US$ exchange rate to domestic prices. The publication of inflation reports on a quarterly
rather than semi-annual basis and the release of model-based inflation and interest rate
forecasts are welcome. But greater clarity is needed about the role of these forecasts in BoI’s
decision making, the relationship between these forecasts and those for other macroeconomic
variables, and about the policy horizon. In addition, swift adoption of the draft BoI law is
particularly important because it would strengthen the economy’s institutional foundation.

20
29.
The recent positive fiscal performance needs to be carried forward into 2008 to
cement its many benefits, including those related to improved international credibility.
The central government budget needs to be kept close to balance, given that good times are
expected to prevail and the economy’s vulnerability to shocks on account of the high debt
ratio needs to be lowered. It is thus appropriate that the budgeted 1.6 percent of GDP central
government deficit is a ceiling and not a target. Maintaining a sound fiscal policy stance
demands strict compliance with the 1.7 percent expenditure growth ceiling, tight budget
execution, and the allocation of any revenue overperformance to debt reduction.
30.
The government’s intention to stick with a rules-based approach to fiscal policy,
solidly anchored in longer-run objectives, is welcome. The main objective of a new rule
should be to achieve a 60 percent debt-to-GDP ratio by 2015. This ratio is considered an
upper limit in many less exposed advanced economies and it can be achieved without an
appreciable tightening in fiscal policy. Furthermore, debt reduction should be given
precedence over tax cuts, although there is scope to simplify the relatively complex tax
system, including through cutting tax exemptions.
31.
Enhanced fiscal transparency and governance are essential to improve the
quality of policy making. Budget documentation needs to include a multiyear scenario
analysis of risks for public finance objectives, and a long-term fiscal sustainability analysis,
which can help the public appreciate the importance of rapid debt reduction. The governance
of the fiscal framework should be further strengthened by instituting independent,
nonpartisan fiscal evaluation.
32.
The ambitious reforms of recent years are fostering the development of a more
diversified financial system but they also raise new risks. With the economic expansion,
financial soundness indicators have been improving, and risks of major losses in financial
institutions appear low, although regulatory capital and solvency levels remain lower than in
many advanced economies. In the meantime, the reforms have unleashed dramatic changes
that have increased the complexity of the financial system. This raises the importance of
high-quality prudential policies and practices, close collaboration among regulators, and
ensuring that reporting standards for financial institutions do not deviate unnecessarily from
international norms.
33.
While much work to adapt the prudential framework and financial
infrastructure is ongoing, the challenges ahead are still major, and regulators’
resources are not commensurate. In particular, the regulators are moving to increase
capital and solvency levels, and are at an early stage of introducing risk-based supervision
approaches. However, regulators need to be able to build the expertise necessary to support a
more complex regulatory system, which in turn requires greater recruitment flexibility and
competitive pay scales. Also, the authorities need to ensure consistency between the pace of
regulatory change and high-quality implementation, and achieve the right balance between
principles-based and rules-based approaches to supervision. They need to strengthen their

21
capacity to manage and resolve financial stress. Finally, the insurance supervisor needs to be
granted formal independence and broader powers, in line with international standards.
34.
Israel has subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination Standards and its
macroeconomic statistical system is generally adequate for Fund surveillance.
35.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12month cycle.

8/ National definition, cash basis.
9/ International definition, accrual basis. On the difference between central and general government deficits during 2003–06: much of it is accounted
for by the difference between accrual and cash bases accounting. On the latter, the key factor is the CPI indexation component that is paid on all NIS
debt when it matures and is recorded below the line in the central government balance but above the line in the general government balance when it
accrues.

Debt-stabilizing
non-interest
current account 6/

4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels
of the last projection year.

2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock. ρ increases with an appreciating domestic currency (ε > 0) and rising inflation
(based on GDP deflator).

Membership Status: Israel became a member of the Fund on July 12, 1954, and
accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 on September 21, 1993,
and, other than solely for national and international security reasons, maintains an
exchange system free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for
current international transactions. Israel subscribes to the SDDS and is in full
observance of the SDDS’s prescriptions for data coverage, periodicity and timeliness,
and for the dissemination of advance release calendars.1

IX.

Exchange Rate Arrangement:
As of June 9, 2005 Israel’s exchange rate regime is officially classified as floating.
This step by the Government of Israel was taken to remove the last vestige of a policy
in which the exchange rate of the NIS fluctuated within the limits of a crawling band.
In practice, however, the NIS has been floating since 1997, when the Bank of Israel
stopped intervening to protect the band.

X.

Article IV consultation:
The last Article IV consultation was concluded on January 19, 2007. Israel is on the
standard 12-month consultation cycle.

XI.

ROSCs:
•

•

XII.

Financial System Stability Assessment was conducted in 2000, issued in August 2001.
Fiscal Transparency ROSC was conducted in 2003, issued in March 2004.
AML/CFT ROSC was conducted in 2003, issued in June 2005.
Data Module ROSC was conducted in 2005, and issued as IMF Country Report
No. 06/125 in March 2006.
Technical Assistance:

The Fund has been providing policy advice and technical assistance to the Palestinian
Authority since the 1993 Oslo Accords, and presently has a senior resident representative
based in Jerusalem. The Fund’s work in the West Bank and Gaza (WBG) has recently
intensified, with a focus on the macroeconomic, fiscal, and financial areas. Staff missions to
the WBG took place during May-August and November 2007 to assist the authorities in
developing their medium-term macroeconomic and fiscal framework. That framework
underpinned the Palestinian Reform and Development Plan (PRDP) presented at the Paris
international donors’ conference in December 2007. Looking forward, the Fund will be
regularly reporting to donors on the macroeconomic and fiscal situation, and on the
implementation of public finance reforms. Technical assistance will be stepped up in the areas
of public expenditure management, banking supervision and regulation, and macroeconomic
statistics.
XIII.

Resident Representative:
A resident representative has been in the WBG since early 1996.

APPENDIX II. ISRAEL: STAFF RESEARCH, 2006−08
Monetary Policy
“Endogenous Monetary Policy Credibility in a Small Macro Model of Israel,” (Eyal Argov,
Natan Epstein, Philippe Karam, Douglas Laxton, and David Rose. 2007, Working Paper).
•

Extends a small linear model of the Israeli economy to allow for nonlinearities in the
inflation-output process that arise from convexity in the Phillips curve and endogenous
monetary policy credibility. Finds that the dynamic responses to shocks in the
extended model more closely resemble features in the data from the recession period
of 2001−03. In particular, the extended model does a much better job in accounting for
the deterioration in monetary policy credibility and the output costs of regaining
monetary policy credibility once it has been lost.

“A Simple Forecasting and Policy Analysis System for Israel: Structure and Applications,”
(Natan Epstein, Philippe Karam, Douglas Laxton, and David Rose. 2006, Selected Issues).
•

Develops a simple forecasting and policy analysis system (FPAS) model to prepare
baseline forecasts and risk assessments for monetary policy and the Israeli economy.
The model is designed to support policy analysis for an inflation-targeting regime and
captures the essential small, open, flexible-exchange-rate economy linkages between
the policy rate and output, inflation and the exchange rate. Conducts risk assessments
on three key sources of uncertainty underlying the baseline forecast— exchange rate,
output gap, and oil prices—and reviews model properties and performance.

Fiscal Policy
“Toward a New Fiscal Rule: What Might Work Well for Israel,” (Xavier Debrun and Natan
Epstein. 2008, Selected Issues).
•

Assess Israel’s fiscal performance against its fiscal rules over the past two decades;
reviews the international experience with fiscal rules; and proposes a new rule for
Israel. In particular, recommends anchoring a new fiscal rule on the objective of
lowering the public debt to 60 percent of GDP by 2015.

“The Political Economy and Fiscal Institutions in Israel,” (Mario Catalan. 2007, Selected
Issues).
•

Analyze the political economy factors that have affected fiscal policy and performance
in Israel. Finds that fragmented parliaments and short average government duration
have boosted public debt and deficits. Argues that strengthening fiscal governance
mechanisms can counter political economy biases to fiscal policy, notably through
enhanced budgetary transparency and analysis and independent fiscal policy
assessment.

5
“Fiscal Consolidation in Israel: A Global Fiscal Model Perspective,” (Selim Elekdag, Natan
Epstein, and Marialuz Moreno-Badía. 2006, Working Paper).
•

Employs the IMF’s Global Fiscal Model to quantify the costs of delaying fiscal
consolidation in Israel. Finds that early consolidation through expenditure cuts would
result in a substantial increase in Israel’s long-term output growth relative to the case
with delayed fiscal adjustment. Using an alternative fiscal instrument, it also finds that
delaying tax cuts would result in long-run cumulative real GDP that is five times
larger than when the tax cuts are immediately implemented.

Financial Sector
“Financial Sector Stability Analysis for Israel,” (Martin Čihák. 2008, Selected Issues).
•

Examines financial sector stability in Israel, focusing on market-based indicators and
stress tests. Compared with the accounting ratios, market-based indicators paint a
more mixed picture of recent financial stability developments in Israel, reflecting
markets’ assessment of challenges and risks associated with the recent financial sector
reforms. The note also presents preliminary results of stress tests for banks, based on
publicly available data. It finds that the banks have become more resilient to shocks
over time, and that credit risk remains the key source of risk.

“Financial Sector Developments,” (Ian Tower, Michael Moore and John Palmer, 2008,
Selected Issues).
•

Describes and analyses recent changes in the financial sector and financial regulation
as they emerge from a period of major reform. Performance of the banks has been
improving. Although one bank has incurred significant losses on assets related to the
US mortgage market, the scope for further losses appears limited, provided that AAA
mortgage-backed securities other than sub-prime are not significantly impaired. A key
development in insurance has been the greater diversification of insurance groups.
Overall the reforms have led to more diverse financial markets and appear to be
generating benefits for the economy. It is also appropriate for the authorities to take
stock of the results so far. Regulation of banking and insurance has been strengthened
but further development is required, especially to build expertise for a more complex
regulatory system and to consider the appropriate balance between a principles-based
and a rules-based approach.

“Financial Sector Supervision Structures: Assessing the Alternatives for Israel,” (Natan
Epstein and Richard Pratt. 2007, Selected Issues).
•

Reviews the international experience with various financial supervision structures.
Examine the key advantages of the different models and provide a neutral assessment
of the existing options. Highlights that any restructuring must provide for more
independent supervision, supported by a strong governance structure; adequate

6
resources for supervision; a strong regulatory capacity; and a level playing field across
financial service industries.
“Corporate Balance Sheets and Investment: Empirical Estimates for Israel,” (Marialuz
Moreno. 2006, Selected Issues).

Analyzes the empirical relationship between corporate leverage— and other indicators

Reviews and analyzes the capital market reforms in Israel. Highlights that, together
with the forced divestiture of banks’ holdings of mutual and provident funds, actions
that the authorities have taken to remove the legal, tax, and regulatory barriers to the
further development of capital markets, are leading to growth and innovation in the
creation of new instruments for investment and risk management. Maintains that the
rapid development of the capital markets have created new supervisory and regulatory
challenges.

This supplement contains information on recent economic developments in Israel that has
become available since the circulation of the staff report for the Article IV consultation. The
information does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.

Following downward revisions to growth forecasts for the United States and
Europe, staff lowered its 2008 real GDP growth projection for Israel from 3.8 to
3.5 percent. While the latest conjunctural indicators do not show any weakness, the main
reason for the downward revision is a fall in projected export growth, which would also slow
investment and private consumption. Risks around the new projection are broadly balanced.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2007 Article IV Consultation with Israel
On February 13, 2008, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Israel.1
Background
The economy is entering the global slowdown with significant momentum. Notwithstanding the
war in the north during 2006, real GDP growth averaged about 5¼ percent during 2006–07.
Buoyant world trade propelled exports and investment, fostering strong employment growth––
which was also supported by welfare reform––and private consumption.
Inflation undershot the 1–3 percent target in 2006 and in the first half of 2007, largely reflecting
sheqel appreciation against the U.S. dollar, but rose in the second half of the year. In December
2007, prices stood 3.4 percent above the end-2006 level. The Bank of Israel (BoI) responded to
the earlier declining price pressure by cutting the policy rate from a peak of 5.5 percent in
October 2006 to 3.5 percent by June 2007. With inflation reaccelerating and unemployment
falling and the output gap closing, the BoI changed course in August 2007, raising rates in three
steps, to 4.25 percent by January 2008.
Fiscal outturns have been much stronger than budgeted over the past couple of years because
of higher-than-projected tax revenue and public expenditure restraint. As a result, the central
government deficit has been kept well below the 3 percent of GDP deficit ceiling, falling to
1 percent of GDP in 2006 and reaching balance in 2007. Nonetheless, public debt remains high

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

at just over 80 percent of GDP. For 2008–09, the central government deficit ceilings are
1.6 percent and 1.0 percent of GDP, respectively.
Indicators for the financial soundness of corporations and households have generally been
improving but the global financial turmoil has caused some increase in risk premia. There have
been losses on mortgage-related US assets but the effect on bank profitability and capital has
been small thus far. Nor have banks been experiencing funding pressures. Concurrently, credit
default swap (CDS) spreads on government bonds are up from unusually-low pre-crisis levels;
and spreads between the returns on corporate and government bonds have widened, testifying
to a general increase in risk premia.
Looking ahead, slowing demand from Israel’s export partner countries is projected to reduce
output growth in 2008 to around 3½ percent, with broadly balanced risks. The ongoing shift from
external to domestic sources of economic growth would further reduce the external current
account surplus.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the Israeli economy’s exceptional performance, which reflects
both sound policy implementation and strong global growth. Directors observed that, while
public debt has declined in recent years, its still elevated level leaves the economy vulnerable to
shocks, and debt reduction remains a priority. They considered that further improvements to the
financial sector framework would enhance the economy’s resilience. Looking forward, Directors
agreed that, with the domestic preconditions for buoyant activity in place, economic growth is
likely to remain strong, although external conditions are becoming less supportive.
Directors observed that, given continued solid growth and growing capacity constraints,
domestic inflationary pressure would probably mount, although the recent appreciation of the
sheqel has lowered external inflationary pressure. They considered that, while interest rates
may have to be at a higher level once external demand reaccelerates, external downside risks
to activity and heightened risk premia argue for caution in raising rates over the near term.
Directors praised monetary policy for successfully stabilizing inflation expectations. They
welcomed improvements in the transparency of policymaking, and encouraged the authorities
to consider steps towards providing greater clarity on the role of macroeconomic forecasts in
decision-making and on the monetary policy horizon. Directors recommended swift adoption of
the draft Bank of Israel law, as it would strengthen the economy’s institutional foundation. They
agreed that the flexible exchange rate regime is serving Israel well.
Directors welcomed the strong fiscal policy performance that brought central government
accounts into balance in 2007. They viewed that, with activity projected to remain strong, the
budget should be kept close to balance, to further reduce the public debt ratio and the
economy’s vulnerability to shocks. Accordingly, for 2008, Directors supported compliance with

3

the 1.7 percent expenditure growth ceiling, tight budget execution, and the allocation of revenue
overperformance to debt reduction.
Looking forward to 2009 and beyond, Directors generally welcomed the government’s intention
to stick with a rules-based approach to fiscal policy. A reformed rule that aims at reaching a
60 percent debt-to-GDP ratio by 2015 would be consistent with a debt level that is considered
an upper limit in many less exposed advanced economies, and could also accommodate an
increase in welfare spending. Directors agreed that debt reduction should be given precedence
over tax cuts, and saw scope to simplify the relatively complex tax system, including through
cutting tax exemptions.
Directors recommended enhanced fiscal transparency and governance to sustain the improved
quality of policy making. Budget documentation could usefully include a multiyear scenario
analysis of risks for public finance objectives, and a long-term fiscal sustainability analysis,
which could help the public appreciate the importance of rapid debt reduction. Consideration
could also be given to strengthening the governance of the fiscal framework by instituting
independent, nonpartisan fiscal evaluation.
Directors concurred that the ambitious reforms of recent years, which foster the development of
a more diversified financial system, may also raise new risks. They welcomed the improvement
in financial soundness indicators, as well as ongoing work to adapt the prudential framework
and financial infrastructure, while noting that major challenges still lie ahead. Directors noted the
importance of giving regulators more scope to build the expertise necessary to support the
increasingly complex regulatory system. Achieving consistency between the pace of regulatory
change and high-quality implementation, and the right balance between principles-based and
rules-based approaches to supervision will also be important. Directors underscored the value
of strengthening the capacity of regulators to manage and resolve financial stress. They also
viewed that the insurance supervisory authority should be granted independence in those areas
where it is currently subject to constraints on its powers, in line with international standards.

Statement by Age Bakker, Executive Director for Israel and
Nir Klein, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
February 13, 2008
General
The Israeli authorities thank staff for the productive discussions in Jerusalem as well as for
their well-written set of papers. They share staff’s appraisal on the challenges ahead and
broadly agree with the report’s key recommendations.
Owing to global economic buoyancy and prudent economic policies, geared toward a freemarket economy, the Israeli economy continued to thrive in 2007, growing at above 5
percent for the fourth year consecutively. The robust economic performance was supported
by high corporate profitability, prosperous financial markets and an increasing household
income, which boosted business confidence and spurred private consumption and investment,
as well as by the benign external conditions that contributed to a strong export performance.
The current account surplus – although somewhat declining - remained at a comfortable
level, and together with the high level of the net external asset position, underpinned the
economy’s external resilience. The positive developments in 2007 percolated to the labor
market as the unemployment rate continued to decline, reaching the lowest level in decades,
while the participation rate continued to grow. Fiscal policy remained responsible, keeping
the central government budget at balance, and thus allowing a sharp reduction in the debt-toGDP ratio. On the monetary front, while opposing inflationary pressures shifted the inflation
rate from a negative level in early 2007 to above the upper limit of the inflation target at the
end of the year, the policy’s high credibility kept inflationary expectations well anchored
within the inflation target range, and thus continued to support price and financial stability.
The impressive momentum of Israel’s economic activity was acknowledged by Standard and
Poor’s, which upgraded Israel’s risk rating in November, and earlier in 2007 (May) by the
OECD, which invited Israel to begin membership negotiations.1 That said, the authorities
well recognize that Israel is not yet “out of the woods” as significant challenges remain,
including the need to reduce the high debt-to-GDP ratio, closing social gaps and, in view of
the recent structural change, further enhance the financial sector’s resilience. In this regard,
they remain committed to continue with prudent policies and underscore their intention to
forcefully progress with their ambitious reform agenda to ensure a sustainable and high
growth path for the economy.
Macroeconomic developments and outlook
In 2007, the Israeli economy continued the strong cyclical upswing that was recorded in the
past three years. Overall, economic activity expanded by 5.3 percent (preliminary estimate)
while the performance of the business sector was even stronger (6.3 percent). Strong

1

A framework for carrying out the accession process (known as the “roadmap”) was set by the OECD Council
(December) and the authorities are now engaging with the OECD’s various bodies in order to complete the
accession process promptly.

2
domestic demand,2 which benefited from supportive macroeconomic policies and benign
business environment, generated a significant increase in imported investment and
consumption goods and contributed to the decline of the current account surplus to 3.6
percent of GDP, despite strong export performance (8.6 percent). On the supply side, while
in previous years growth was largely based on high productivity growth, a significant
increase in labor and capital inputs became apparent in 2007. Indeed, the unemployment rate
declined by 0.9 percentage points to 7.5 percent, while the participation rate increased to 56.4
percent, and fixed capital formation increased by 10.4 percent. The deceleration of
productivity indicates that excess capacity is narrowing, and that a future increase in
demands may result in higher inflationary pressures. In this context, signs of price pressures
from the labor market are beginning to emerge as real wages rose this year by 2.7 percent,
which is significantly higher than in the previous two years.
Looking ahead, the authorities broadly share the staff’s assessment that the domestic
fundamentals are solid and provide a firm platform for future expansion. They well recognize
that growth performance is likely to be less strong than in previous years as capacity
constraints are beginning to bind and external conditions are becoming less supportive.
Accordingly, the authorities’ baseline scenario suggests that 2008 GDP growth will be in a
4.2-4.4 percent range, assuming a moderate slowdown in global economic activity and no
significant change in the geo-political situation. A more conservative scenario (3.6 percent),
which in view of the recent global developments is becoming more realistic, is also being
considered. The authorities are closely monitoring current developments and intend to revise
their growth projections should conditions warrant that.
Fiscal policy
In 2007, the authorities continued with prudent fiscal policy-making and further progressed
with fiscal consolidation. Buoyant revenues and strong fiscal discipline, as reflected in a tight
expenditure envelope, led to a balanced central government budget, despite the ongoing
implementation of the tax reform, in which corporate and personal income tax rates are being
reduced, and the significant increase in defense-related spending following the conflict in the
north. The balanced budget, coupled with robust GDP growth, contributed to a sharp
reduction in the debt-to-GDP ratio to the level of 81 percent of GDP in 2007. This decline
sums up an accumulated decrease of more than 20 percent in 4 years. In the same vein, the
ongoing fiscal retrenchment continued to support the business sector’s activity and was
reflected in downsizing of the public sector to 46 percent of GDP, compared to 56 percent in
2002.
While being encouraged by the recent fast decline in debt-to-GDP ratio, the authorities
recognize that its current level remains relatively high and needs to be further reduced to
contain the remaining vulnerabilities. They agree with staff’s view that reducing debt to GDP
to the level of 60 percent over the medium term is an ambitious yet achievable goal and
reiterate their intention to make every effort to progress in this direction. In this context, the
2

According to early estimates, in 2007, the private consumption and investment rose by 7.2 percent and 13.4
percent, respectively.

3
authorities are in the process of redefining their fiscal policy rules. Accordingly, they intend
to revise the current fiscal rules to ensure the continuation of debt reduction (as a share of
GDP) in both good and bad times, while allowing a more sustainable path for public
expenditures. The expectation is that new fiscal rules will be introduced and adopted in the
course of this year and will take effect in the 2009 budget onwards.
In late December, the Knesset adopted the 2008 budget, which envisages a deficit of 1.6
percent of GDP and expenditure real growth of 1.7 percent, in line with earlier
commitments.3 The authorities, nevertheless, underscore that the envisaged fiscal deficit
should be regarded as a ceiling, and in fact, expect to end the year with a smaller deficit, as in
the past few years. The budget envisages a significant increase in the public civil
consumption (nearly 7 percent), which under the current tight expenditure rule, was possible
due to the considerable reduction of public debt and its associated interest rate payments. The
budget aims at closing social gaps, inter alia, by encouraging labor participation, reforming
the education system and increasing the support to weak population.
In an effort to streamline the budgetary process and allow a far-reaching public debate on the
budget components, the government has agreed to bring forward the submission of the
budget proposal to the Knesset. The proposed 2009 budget will be submitted no later than 30
September 2008 and the proposed 2010 budget and future budgets will be submitted no later
than 31 August. To further increase transparency and improve fiscal management, the MoF
positively considers, in line with staff’s recommendation, introducing a multi-year budgetary
plan with an explicit analysis of potential risks.
Monetary issues
The opposing inflationary pressures, driven by both domestic and external factors, shifted, in
2007, the monetary stance from easing to tightening. In the first half of the year, the
significant appreciation of the Sheqel, coupled with the decline in energy prices toward the
end of 2006, exerted downward pressures on prices and brought the inflation rate in the last
12 months to a negative level. Consequently, the Bank of Israel (BoI) continued to maintain
an accommodative monetary stance by gradually cutting the interest rate by 1 percent to 3.5
percent in June, thus allowing the US-Israel interest rate differential to reach its record-high
level (1.75 percent). During this period, local components of the CPI continued to increase,
yet their impact on the overall headline inflation was rather moderate. In the remainder of the
year, the narrowing output gap and higher energy and food prices exerted greater inflationary
pressures and pushed the inflation rate toward the upper limit of the inflation target range (13 percent). Accordingly, the BoI tightened the monetary stance and gradually raised the
interest rate to 4 percent. In January 2008, the interest rate was raised again by additional
25bp following new indications about mounting inflationary pressures. The CPI recorded,
during 2007, an overall increase of 3.4 percent. At present monetary policy has to take into
account both the ongoing inflationary pressures from the closing of the output gap, and the
3

In addition, the budget envisages one off spending to allow an increase in defense-related spending following
the conflict in the north and to finance the remainder of the disengagement costs. This implies an additional
spending growth of 1.5 percent.

4
impacts on future inflation of the slowdown in global demand growth and the strengthening
of the Sheqel. This caused the authorities to leave the interest rate for February unchanged,
and leaves the future course of interest rates uncertain.
While the high variability of inflation underscores the complexity of monetary policymaking
in a small and open economy such as Israel where exchange rate movements largely affect
the pattern of prices, it is worth noting that inflation expectations for one and two years ahead
remained relatively stable and, for most of 2007, fluctuated within the inflation target range.4
This serves as a testimony to the high credibility of the current flexible inflation targeting
framework and the public’s recognition that the BoI is committed to meet the inflation target
at the medium term. The BoI is constantly making efforts to improve its communication and
transparency. In this regard, it has started to publish its forecast about the interest rate path5
and intends, starting from 2008, to shift toward quarterly publication of Inflation Reports.
Following a protracted dispute over the wage structure at the BoI, an agreement was signed
(December 2007) between the BoI and MoF and the labor union. It is expected that this
agreement will pave the way for prompt adoption of the new BoI law as well as for the
acceleration of the BoI’s restructuring process, which will enhance the BoI’s capacity and
professional independence and place it in line with the best practice of central banks in
advanced economies.
Financial sector issues
Israel’s financial system is undergoing rapid reform-driven change. Accelerated financial
deepening has fostered economic growth and has been reflected in a continuous improvement
in financial sector’s indicators. In this context, since 2004 there has been an improvement in
banks' earnings, capital ratios, levels of NPLs and in loan-loss reserves, and even under an
extreme stress-test scenario, the banking system is resilient. By and large, the current
financial turmoil has had so far a relatively moderate impact on financial institutions’ balance
sheets due to their limited exposure and conservative investment approach. That said, the
authorities are vigorously monitoring the banks and other financial institutions’ exposures to
structured products, and have required enhanced transparency in their financial statements.
The staff rightly points out that the recent capital market reform has generated significant
challenges for supervisors as risks have shifted from banks to institutional investors and
households. While a new inter-institutional (Ariav) committee was recently established to
address the emerging challenges, the authorities have taken several steps to secure financial
stability, inter alia by increasing markets’ transparency and discipline as well as fostering
greater competition and market sophistication. Among other measures, the authorities
enacted a series of new regulations to facilitate switching between the supervised entities and
choosing between different savings instruments and plans, and launched a website that
enables comparison between provident funds and between pension funds. Additionally,
following extensive discussions with commercial banks, the latter decided to exploit the

benign macroeconomic conditions, and included in their business plans a gradual rise in
capital ratios to the range of 12-13 percent (from 10-12 percent) within the next two years.
In May 2007, the authorities announced a Joint Work Plan for the Supervisor of Banks and
Banks regarding implementation of Basel II. The plan has a twofold objective: enhancing the
risk management, control systems and corporate governance of the banks as well as moving
towards risk- and principles-based banking supervision. The authorities intend to devote
substantial resources to this issue, including through hiring high-quality international experts,
and they are conducting consultations with banks in order to implement Basel II by the end
of 2009. In line with disclosure requirements of Basel II, the authorities published a new
financial reporting directive on the measurement and disclosure of impaired loans and debt
securities, credit risk and the allowance for credit risk. The directive improves the standards
for measurement and disclosure of credit risks, in alignment with the advanced economies'
standards, as well as the banks' ability to monitor and measure credit risks. The authorities
share staff’s appraisal that more is needed to improve their capacity to manage and resolve
financial stress. To this end, the BoI’s Governor established teams with the objective to
prepare a manual on this issue.
Structural reforms and social policy
The authorities are continuing with their ambitious reform agenda to boost competitiveness
and efficiency in the markets. In 2007, the government reduced its holding in the Pi-Glilot
gas depot and completed the privatization process of the Israel Oil Refineries with the sale of
the second oil refinery in Haifa. Further structural changes in the energy sector also include
the government’s intention to split the monopolistic Electric Corporation into several
separated companies (transmission, generation and distribution) in order to improve
efficiency and induce price reduction. Additional planned privatizations, which are currently
in the stage of evaluation and assessment, include the Postal Authority, the Israeli Military
Industries (IMI), the Israel Aircraft Industry (IAI) and the seaport in Eilat.
As for the social developments, the authorities are encouraged by the fact that after a
continuous increase in poverty, the extent of the population living below the poverty line, has
recorded a moderate decline.6 7 Nevertheless, the poverty level remains high and income
inequality continues to be among the highest in the world. The government, in this regard,
adopted (April 2007) the “Social-Economic Agenda for 2008-10”, which sets explicit targets
for poverty and the labor market participation rate.8 To achieve these targets the government
intends to introduce in the course of 2008 an Earned Credit Income Tax (EITC), which
subsidizes low wage working families, to expand vocational training in the context of

The NII 2007 poverty report, which reviews the scale of poverty in 2006, shows that the population below the
poverty line moderately declined by 0.6 to 20 percent (after welfare payments and taxes).

It should be noted that the poverty measure in Israel is of relative poverty: a person is defined as being poor if
his or her income is below half the median income. It is thus more a measure of income gaps than of absolute
poverty.

The two targets are gradually increasing the participation rate for ages 25-64 by 2.6 percent to the OECD
average (71.7 percent) and increasing the income of the lowest socio-economical quintile by 10 percent higher
than the growth of GDP per capita until 2010.

ALMP, subsidize day-care centers (to encourage mothers to join the labor market), to
strengthen enforcement of labor laws and to reduce the number of illegal foreign workers.
The new agreement between the labor union and the manufacturers association on a
mandatory pension is also expected to contribute to poverty reduction over the medium and
longer term.
