Executive Summary
Background
While the recent strong growth performance continued in 2006, inflation accelerated.
Despite considerable disruptions to energy supply late in the year, real GDP growth reached
7 percent, fueled by a surge in construction activity and continuing strong remittance-financed
demand for retail and trade services. However, CPI-inflation reached 12.7 percent, its highest
level since 2003, mostly as a result of failed harvests and higher gas prices, but also reflecting a
relatively loose monetary policy stance and remittance-related demand pressures. The exchange
rate has been relatively stable, with reduced intervention in the foreign exchange market.
Inflation risks for 2007 are on the upside, mostly because of the recent decision by
Uzbekistan to double gas export prices. While staff welcomed the authorities’ decision to
pass through fully the cost of higher gas prices, this increase—to take place at the same time as
an adjustment in electricity tariffs of 40 percent on average—may compromise the authorities’
macroeconomic goals for 2007.
Key Policy Issues and Discussions
The main policy issue discussed during the consultation was the need to develop a
sustainable and credible external debt management strategy. The size and rapid
disbursement profile of project loans from China over the next three years may put Tajikistan at
increased risk of future debt problems, particularly if the authorities’ ambitious growth
objectives are not achieved. Although concessional in nature, the disbursement of these loans
will lead to a rapid reaccumulation of debt, very soon after debt relief was provided under the
Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI).
Controlling inflation will require a supportive policy framework. The authorities’
macroeconomic policy framework should continue to be buttressed by a strong fiscal position,
and accompanied by a firm commitment to a flexible exchange rate regime, but also reinforced
by efforts to strengthen the monetary policy framework. In this connection, the balance sheet of
the central bank needs to be put on a stronger footing to give more flexibility and credibility to
monetary policy.
The authorities’ medium-term growth objectives are ambitious. Reaching these goals will
require considerable determination on the part of the government to address long-standing
problems in the agricultural and energy sectors and to intensify efforts to improve the private
investment climate and enhance corporate governance, including for state-owned enterprises.
The authorities should also continue with reforms in the fiscal and banking areas.

4
I. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
1.
Tajikistan’s performance under two ESAF/PRGF arrangements (1998–2005) was
strong. Economic growth during 2002–05 in particular far exceeded program projections,
though inflation performance was at times volatile, mostly because of lax monetary policy. A
strong fiscal policy stance was the centerpiece of macroeconomic policy efforts (Figures 1–2),
with significant remittance flows playing a key role in fostering growth. Moreover, foreign debt
has fallen sharply, to a sustainable level. While initial progress in implementing structural
reforms in the context of weak institutional capacity was mixed, the authorities’
implementation record improved significantly over time, reflecting enhanced program
ownership and more streamlined conditionality. Nevertheless, the implementation of some key
structural reforms is still pending.
2.
Tajikistan has significant development potential, particularly in the agricultural
and electricity sectors. Much of this potential, however, remains unexploited, primarily
because of an uncertain private investment environment and a protracted structural reform
process. The authorities’ development strategy is currently based on attracting large debt flows
in order to benefit from the country’s comparative advantage in these sectors, with plans for
accompanying sectoral reforms largely at an early stage.
3.
The main policy issue discussed during the consultation was the need to develop a
sustainable and credible external debt management strategy. The size and rapid
disbursement profile of project loans from China may put Tajikistan at increased risk of future
debt problems (Box 1). Although concessional in nature (with a grant element of 40 percent),
the disbursement of these loans will lead to a rapid reaccumulation of debt, very soon after debt
relief was provided under the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI).
II. RECENT POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
4.
The political situation remains stable following the November 2006 presidential
elections. President Rakhmonov, who is seen as the sponsor of economic progress and hardwon stability after the civil war, was reelected to a new seven-year term with a significant
majority of the votes.
5.
While the recent strong growth performance continued in 2006, inflation
accelerated. Despite considerable disruptions to energy supply late in the year, real GDP
growth reached 7 percent, fueled by a surge in construction activity and continuing strong
remittance-financed demand for retail services. However, CPI-inflation reached 12.7 percent,
its highest level since 2003, mostly as a result of failed harvests and higher gas prices, but also
reflecting a relatively passive monetary policy stance and remittance-related demand pressures.
6.
Fiscal policies remained sound despite the election cycle. The budget recorded a
better-than-expected surplus of about 0.8 percent of GDP (excluding the externally-financed
Public Investment Program (PIP) and the MDRI grant), reflecting a strong tax revenue
performance and the government’s decision to refrain from seeking approval for a
supplementary budget. Despite the accumulation of tax arrears by the Tajik Aluminum Smelter

Box 1. Project Financing from China
In June 2006, the authorities signed three separate credit agreements totaling about $604 million with
the Export-Import Bank of China. The loans will be disbursed over the next three years and will finance
the construction of two high-voltage electricity lines and the rehabilitation of the road linking Tajikistan and
Uzbekistan.
In January 2007, the authorities signed a memorandum of understanding for an additional $400
million in financing from China for the construction of new hydropower projects, thus bringing the total
amount of loans to be disbursed by China over the next three years to $1 billion (about 35 percent of 2006
GDP).
The World Bank believes that the transmission line and road projects have the potential to contribute
to Tajikistan’s long-term growth prospects, if they are implemented according to the original plan and
costs, and are accompanied by appropriate sectoral reforms. At this point, however, there is not enough
information available to conduct a proper assessment of the economic viability of the new hydropower
projects.

VAT-related revenues surged as they are not affected by such agreements.

7.
Monetary policy was relatively loose in 2006. In an effort to keep aggregate demand
strong ahead of presidential elections, the central bank refrained from taking an active role in
stemming inflationary pressures, and actually reduced its sterilization operations significantly.
Moreover, the National Bank of Tajikistan (NBT) provided subsidized loans to the agricultural
sector in the last quarter of 2006, partly financed by a $10 million loan from the Development
Bank of China. These developments, however, were partly offset by a significant accumulation
of government deposits late in the year. There has been little progress in the deliberations of the
commission charged with developing a strategy to securitize the government obligations on the
NBT’s balance sheet and to recapitalize it. As a result, the NBT relies almost exclusively on
reserve requirements and the issuance of its own bills, albeit on a limited basis, to regulate
monetary conditions.
8.
The de facto flexibility of the somoni has progressively decreased since late 2004.2
The relative stability of the somoni appears to have been supported by the strong growth in
workers’ remittances rather than by a deliberate attempt to peg the rate, particularly as it has
been accompanied by declining NBT intervention in the foreign exchange market (Figure 3).
Moreover, the authorities remain committed to a flexible exchange rate regime. There are no
signs that the somoni is overvalued, but the export base remains very narrow. Although the
current account deficit is projected to widen significantly in the medium term, this reflects the
disbursement of significant project financing. Finally, despite significant remittance inflows,
the country has not had to deal with the effects of Dutch disease or any significant impact on
domestic liquidity yet (Box 2).
9.
Despite record-high aluminum prices, a strong performance in noncotton
agricultural exports, and the continued rapid growth of workers’ remittances, external
accounts did not improve commensurately. Since Tajikistan does not mine the raw material
for aluminum production, but rather relies on an export processing agreement with its foreign
suppliers for its processing, export performance did not fully benefit from higher aluminum
prices in 2006.3 While workers’ remittances continued to grow at a very rapid pace, these flows
were just enough to offset the increase in the trade deficit resulting from higher energy import
prices and buoyant demand for imported consumer and foreign-financed capital goods. Gross
reserves remain relatively low, at the equivalent of about two months of imports.

2

According to a classification developed in Reinhart and Rogoff (2004), an exchange regime could be classified
as a de facto peg when the proportion of monthly exchange rate changes over the previous two years falling within
a +/- 1 percent range exceeds 80 percent.

3

According to the authorities, TadAZ receives a fixed pre-negotiated fee for the processing of alumina. This
arrangement has been in effect since 2005, and in 2006 the fee was $410 per ton of aluminum. The details of the
arrangement are not fully transparent.

Box 2. The Role of Remittances in Tajikistan
In recent years, remittances have grown exponentially, and have emerged as the main source of financing of the trade deficit,
outstripping official loans and grants (Figure 1). Although the increase can be partially explained by improvements in the quality and
coverage of data, the magnitude of these flows is evident. Unsatisfactory job prospects in Tajikistan and buoyant recent growth in
Russia—the origin of about 90 percent of remittances—where monthly dollar wages have tripled since 2001, contributed to this growth.

Recorded remittances to Tajikistan are among the highest in the world as a percentage of GDP (Figure 2).
By supporting consumption and expenditure on health and education, remittances have contributed to growth and poverty
reduction. So far, there has been no evidence of appreciation pressure via either a rapid accumulation of reserves or nominal
appreciation. Three factors likely explain this (1) high import content of remittances inflows; (2) accumulation of remittances proceeds in
the form of cash, rather than bank deposits; and (3) high dollarization of the Tajik economy.

A strong macroeconomic policy framework and continued progress with financial stabilization and structural reforms are
needed to respond to challenges that remittances may pose. Reliance on remittances to finance consumption and investment may make
the economy more vulnerable to external economic and political developments. A well-targeted social safety net is needed to protect the
poorest in the case of interruption of remittances.

11
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
10.
The Article IV discussions focused on a) the debt sustainability implications of the
authorities’ debt-based development strategy; and b) policy challenges to keep inflation under
control while sustaining growth. The mission also discussed prospects for reinvigorating
structural reform efforts and possible support under the Policy Support Instrument (PSI).
The Debt Issue
11.
The authorities explained that their development strategy involved a very rapid
accumulation of external debt, on concessional terms, over the next three years. After
lowering the external debt-to-GDP ratio to an estimated 31 percent by end-2006—mostly as a
result of a debt restructuring operation with Russia and MDRI relief—the authorities’ plans to
go ahead with the contracting of $1 billion of concessional loans from China would bring that
ratio to a projected 56 percent by end-2009. In NPV terms, the debt-to-GDP ratio would rise to
about 45 percent (from 25 percent now), compared with a DSA threshold of 30 percent, and
would remain above this threshold for a number of years. The DSA prepared by staff, jointly
with the World Bank, shows that debt dynamics would seriously deteriorate should economic
growth not materialize at the rates forecast by the authorities (Appendix I).4
12.
While mindful of the implications for debt sustainability of contracting these loans,
the authorities argued that their current debt management strategy is geared towards the
promotion of regional economic integration, enhancing growth prospects in the longer term and
reducing poverty. Specifically, they noted that they are looking to finance projects that would
alleviate existing domestic and regional transportation bottlenecks, allow for increased trade in
the region (most importantly in electricity and agricultural products), and improve domestic
infrastructure. They also stressed that the Chinese government was the only available source of
concessional financing for these critical projects. They nonetheless agreed with staff that proper
project vetting mechanisms needed to be put in place at the earliest, possibly with external
assistance.
13.
The authorities stated that they intended to be constrained by a medium-term
foreign debt ceiling of 60 percent of GDP. Staff indicated that the planned pace of debt
accumulation, even if constrained by this ceiling, would greatly increase the risk of future debt
problems for Tajikistan, particularly as plans for supporting sectoral reforms remain largely
unclear. Specifically, the lack of a well-defined electricity regulatory regime, problems with
payment discipline on the part of state-owned enterprises, and remaining distortions in the
agricultural sector, which could benefit the most from the road project, create uncertainty about
the economic viability of the projects in question. Moreover, staff expressed concerns that the
rapid accumulation of debt would put additional pressure on the budget, as significant
counterpart funds would be needed, which would reduce resources available for other key
priority sectors and affect macroeconomic performance.
4

Tajikistan is now classified as a “medium performer” by the World Bank, which would imply a threshold of
40 percent. However, recent guidance from the Executive Board requires the use of three-year CPIA average
scores in cases of rapid debt accumulation.

12
Challenges to Controlling Inflation While Sustaining Growth
14.
Inflation risks for 2007 are on the upside, mostly because of the recent decision by
Uzbekistan to double gas export prices. 5 While staff welcomed the authorities’ decision to
pass through fully the cost of higher gas prices, this increase—to take place at the same time as
an adjustment in electricity tariffs of 40 percent on average—may compromise the authorities’
original goal of 7½ percent growth and 7 percent inflation for 2007. Since the inflation target
was likely to prove especially challenging, the authorities considered that it would be more
credible to aim for inflation in the range of 8–9 percent, particularly when taking into account
the worse-than-expected 2006 outcome. While a strong fiscal stance would remain central in
the fight against inflation, the NBT agreed with staff that they should also remain vigilant and
tighten monetary policy as required to avoid second-round price effects from higher energy
prices, and that a flexible exchange rate framework should be maintained.
15.
Based on approved expenditure plans, a continuation of the strong 2006 tax
revenue performance would likely lead to a small fiscal surplus in 2007. The authorities
argued, however, that they wanted to stick to their original budget deficit target of 1 percent of
GDP, to allow for higher social expenditures and support wage reform, which would require
the approval of a supplementary budget later in the year. Staff noted that under current
expenditure plans, a significant increase in these areas is already contemplated, including a
larger allocation for the energy compensation mechanism and higher wages and pensions
(½ percent of GDP in total), financed in part by MDRI resources. As such, staff urged the
authorities to save a large part of any revenue overperformance, particularly at a time when
inflation was on an upward trend and debt dynamics were worsening, and that, at a minimum, a
supplementary budget should not be considered until the inflation picture had sufficiently
improved.
16.
The NBT noted that, because of a lack of progress in resolving the large
outstanding debt of the cotton sector and the absence of appropriate financing
mechanisms, there were strong pressures to provide financial resources to the agricultural
sector, which could undermine inflation performance. The authorities stressed that they were
working with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the World Bank as lead agencies in
resolving the debt of the cotton sector—incurred by farms under a complex system of in-kind
credit from intermediaries—and in designing a mechanism for financing the agricultural sector,
which would be accompanied by appropriate sectoral reforms. The mission encouraged the
authorities to continue to work closely with the lead agencies to find a solution to this critical
problem, while noting that the FSAP team could provide assistance in evaluating the merits of
any draft resolution plan.
17.
There has been little progress in strengthening the balance sheet of the NBT. The
authorities stressed that, while they remain committed to enhancing the marketability of the
stock of government securities held by the NBT and restoring the capital position of the NBT,
moving forward with specific steps, especially on recapitalization, required a careful

assessment of the accounting and legal implications of carrying out such efforts. The mission
urged the authorities to implement without further delay the recommendations of the
March 2006 MCM technical assistance mission in the area of monetary operations, and to
continue to seek support from the MCM regional advisor on these matters. Moreover, given the
complexity of the subject, the mission encouraged the authorities to seek technical assistance
from MCM in the area of central bank recapitalization.
Reinvigorating Structural Reforms
18.
The medium-term prospects are good, but not without risks, particularly as the role
of remittances in sustaining high rates of growth and reducing poverty could be expected to
diminish, and may be affected by potential restrictions in the movement of workers. In the
medium term, the authorities intend to reduce inflation to an average of 6 percent, while GDP
growth is projected at an average rate of 8 percent a year. Further new investment in
infrastructure and the energy sector, coupled with the commissioning of the Sangtuda I
hydroelectric project, will continue to boost construction and the services sector. The
agricultural sector is also expected to benefit from continued strong demand from Russia and
Kazakhstan. The authorities nevertheless agreed that reaching these goals requires a
reinvigoration of their efforts to stimulate private investment and diversify Tajikistan’s export
and production base. Specifically, the authorities recognize that there is an urgent need to
address long-standing policy issues in the agricultural and energy sectors.
19.
The authorities reaffirmed their commitment to pushing ahead with the
outstanding structural reform agenda, but recognized that some difficult steps are still to be
taken:
•

On fiscal structural reforms, significant progress has been achieved in the areas of tax
administration and public financial management (Boxes 3–4). Nevertheless, the
authorities need to urgently address remaining weaknesses in tax compliance and
financial monitoring of state enterprises.

•

The banking sector is now stronger but remains small and vulnerable (Figure 4).
The banking system appears well-capitalized and profitable, but despite rapid growth in
credits and deposits in recent years, it remains small and is heavily dollarized. Although
nonperforming loans have declined, they are still relatively high by international
standards and provisioning may be insufficient. Moreover, public disclosure
requirements are inadequate and, despite legal amendments introduced late in 2005,
foreign competition is still very limited. An FSAP assessment is currently underway
and is expected to inform the authorities’ reform agenda.

•

While there has been some progress in improving the finances of the energy sector, a
large agenda remains. Notably, structural and regulatory weaknesses in the electricity
sector continue to undermine its enormous potential. While a first adjustment of
25 percent was enacted on February 1, 2007, further significant increases in electricity
tariffs are needed to make the electricity sector financially viable. Moreover, a formal
regulatory framework for the electricity sector is still missing, which may explain the
lack of more interest from potential foreign investors.

14

Box 3. Tajikistan: Improvements in Public Financial Management System
In recent years, Tajikistan achieved important progress in improving fiscal transparency and
strengthening key public financial management (PFM) areas. The recent Fiscal ROSC and FAD
technical assistance missions concluded that (a) the roles and responsibilities of the executive, legislature,
and judiciary are clearly defined; (b) reporting on the budget to parliament and the general public has
strengthened in recent years; (c) the stock of expenditure arrears has been dramatically reduced and there is no
accumulation of new arrears; (d) the creation of a budget institution has strengthened public financial
accountability; and (e) the law on State Finance has markedly strengthened the regulatory framework of the
budget process.
This improvement was also acknowledged in the staff assessment of Tajikistan’s qualification for the
MDRI (Republic of Tajikistan—Staff Assessment of Qualification for the Multilateral Debt Relief
Initiative, December 8, 2005 (www.imf.org)). The assessment concluded that the country’s core PFM system
works reasonably well and compares favorably to that of a number of other HIPCs that qualify for debt relief.

Poverty-Reduction Public Spending", April 2005 (Country Report No. 05/177) and Tajikistan's "Staff Assessment of Qualification for the MDRI"
December 2005 .

Despite progress so far, Tajikistan still faces some key challenges in improving its public finance systems.
The monitoring of financial operations of state-owned enterprises deserves greater attention and scrutiny to
identify and report on contingent liabilities and quasi-fiscal activities of these enterprises. Likewise, the design
and implementation of a new commitment control system in harmony with the implementation of the new
decentralized procurement system should be in place to avoid recurrence of expenditure arrears. While
Tajikistan’s budget process has improved, the authorities need to develop an organizational classification in line
with international standards for budget preparation and execution, clearly demarcate the boundaries between the
general government sector and the broader public sector, and strengthen the link between policy and budgeting.

15

Box 4. Tajikistan: Reforms in Revenue Administration
An important element of the reform program of the government has been the modernization of the
revenue administration framework, where early reform efforts have contributed to the strong growth in
tax revenues. These achievements have laid the foundation for further reforms needed to lift Tajikistan’s level
of collections which, despite steady improvement during the past five years, still remains at the lower end of the
scale among CIS countries.

1/ Central government

With technical assistance from donors, including the IMF, the authorities have made significant progress
over the past 3–4 years in the areas of legislation (new tax and customs codes were introduced in 2005),
restructuring the tax department along functional lines, clarifying the responsibility of tax administration for the
collection of social security taxes, and introducing new procedures and systems.
Nevertheless, the full implementation of several key reforms is lagging, partly due to personnel capacity
constraints. Almost two years after the adoption of new tax and customs codes, the authorities have been able
to adopt only half of the required supporting regulations. Tax arrears have increased substantially in recent
years, particularly those of state-owned enterprises. The ongoing restructuring of the tax department along
functional lines also needs to be completed.

•

While the government has made some headway on land reform, distortions remain.
Even though a significant number of land share certificates were issued to private
farmers, restructured farms are still subject to implicit state control over production and
harvesting decisions, particularly in the cotton sector. Finally, there is an urgent need to
facilitate the use of share certificates as collateral for obtaining bank financing.

President Rakhmonov told the mission that governance concerns, which continue to
plague Tajikistan, are seriously affecting the business climate and private sector growth
(Box 5). Staff welcomed the legislative changes that were introduced in 2006 to cut
down on bureaucratic and overly complex regulatory and licensing procedures.
Nevertheless, the implementation of the approved procedures has been slow and
accompanying regulations have not been approved. Efforts to privatize large stateowned enterprises and improve corporate governance are lagging.

A Possible PSI-supported program
20.
The authorities explored with the mission a possible PSI. They felt that Fund
support, in the form of a PSI, could be important for safeguarding the macroeconomic stability
achieved under the previous PRGF arrangement, accelerating structural reform, and enhancing
the role of the private sector in fostering economic growth. They also expressed their
commitment to continue with the reforms of core institutions, specifically in the areas of
revenue administration, public expenditure, and the design and implementation of monetary
policy. However, the authorities and the staff were unable to reach understandings on the
appropriate borrowing policies (see paragraphs 11–13).
Other Issues
21.
The authorities are in the process of completing their second Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper (PRSP2) to cover the period of 2007–09. They expect to complete the PRSP2
in the first quarter of 2007, before holding a donors’ meeting, which they have asked the World
Bank to organize to seek pledges for its implementation. The PRSP2 is expected to focus on
efforts to improve the private investment climate and the consolidation of their public sector
reform program.
22.
Tajikistan continues to pursue membership of the WTO, which the authorities
believe would provide a boost to exports, investment and growth in Tajikistan. While
Tajikistan has a relatively low-tariff open trade regime, the WTO Accession Working Party has
noted that issues remain relating to market access in services, electricity subsidies, as well as
discriminatory rules toward foreign investors’ participation in the privatization process. Despite
some progress in improving bilateral relations, bottlenecks remain in trade and transit relations
with Uzbekistan. In that regard, the accession of Uzbekistan to the Eurasian Economic
Community (EAEC) is expected to serve as a catalyst for progress in this area.
23.
A LEG technical assistance mission in late 2006 found that the second draft of a new
AML/CFT law addresses some of the shortcomings identified in an earlier version of the draft
law. Nevertheless, the mission also found that the law still falls short of international standards
and further work is needed, including a formal decision on the responsibilities and governance
structure of the proposed Financial Intelligence Unit, and thus is unlikely to be adopted before
the second half of 2007.

18
Box 5: Private Investment Climate
The World Bank’s Governance Indicators rank Tajikistan rather low on all five key indicators
(Figure 1). Transparency International also assigns the country a low score of 2.2 and a rank of 142 out of 158
countries on its Corruption Perception Index (CPI), and a regional rank of 17 out of 21 countries sampled.
While rankings indicate slow progress in this area, improving governance has recently been placed high on the list
of government priorities.
The World Bank’s Doing Business in 2006 ranks Tajikistan at 133 out of 175 countries. Its best ranking is
achieved in such categories as employment laws, registering property, enforcing contracts, and closing a business
(all above rank 50), while poor ranking is observed in protecting investors (rank 174), starting a business (rank
166), trading across borders (rank 163), paying taxes (rank 154), and getting credit (rank 143). The trading across
borders category stands out especially: it takes an average of 12 documents, 58 days and $3,925 to carry out
foreign trade transactions, compared to the regional average of 9 documents, 33 days and $1,519.
According to the EBRD’s Transition Indicators, Tajikistan has lagged behind most transition economies in the
region (Figure 2). The World Economic Forum’s Growth Competitiveness Index (GCI) places Tajikistan 96
out of 125 assessed countries. However, its performance does not diverge significantly from its comparators
(Figure 3).

IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
24.
The authorities’ debt-based development strategy entails substantial risks to debt
sustainability in the longer term. In the absence of appropriate project vetting mechanisms,
and delays in implementing key sectoral reforms, the prospective significant debt accumulation

19
in the coming years could lead to debt-servicing problems in the future, particularly if the
authorities’ ambitious growth objectives are not achieved. Staff therefore urges the authorities
to put in place a well-defined debt management strategy that would include cautious limits on
the accumulation of new debt, reaffirm their commitment to contract debt only on a
concessional basis, and set up appropriate vetting mechanisms to assess the economic viability
of proposed projects.
25.
The authorities expressed interest in a PSI-supported program. Staff recognizes
that a Fund arrangement could be beneficial for a country that, despite recent gains, remains
among the poorest in the region. However, while the authorities have broadly followed Fund
advice and appear more committed to reform than in the early years of engagement, they are
determined to pursue their debt-based development strategy. In view of the substantial risks this
entails to debt sustainability, staff does not consider the strategy to be appropriate.
26.
Controlling inflation will require a supportive policy framework. Staff believes that
the authorities’ macroeconomic policy framework should continue to be buttressed by a strong
fiscal position, and accompanied by a firm commitment to a flexible exchange rate regime, but
also reinforced by efforts to strengthen the monetary policy framework. The authorities should
save a large part of any revenue overperformance in 2007. Moreover, the balance sheet of the
central bank needs to be put on a stronger footing to give more flexibility and credibility to
monetary policy. Given the balance sheet problems of the central bank, the policy of directed
credits should be ended. Any financial resources, particularly if subsidized, should be
channeled through the budget in a transparent manner.
27.
Staff welcomes the central bank’s continued commitment to a managed exchange
rate float, with intervention in the foreign exchange market limited to smoothing operations
and shoring up the reserve coverage.
28.
The authorities’ medium-term growth objectives are ambitious, but achievable.
Reaching these goals will require considerable determination on the part of the government to
address long-standing policy issues in the agricultural and energy sectors and to intensify
efforts to improve the private investment climate and enhance corporate governance, including
for state-owned enterprises. In this regard, while initial steps to adjust electricity prices are
welcome, a properly defined regulatory framework needs to be put in place as soon as possible
to allow the country to take full advantage of its potential in this sector. Similarly, staff
encourages the authorities to ensure that production decisions in the agricultural sector are not
subject to political interference and to continue to work closely with the ADB and the
World Bank in finding an equitable and macroeconomically sound solution to the cotton debt
problem. The authorities should also continue with ongoing reforms in the fiscal and banking
sector areas.
29.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Tajikistan takes place on the
standard 12-month cycle.

APPENDIX I. TAJIKISTAN: JOINT FUND–WORLD BANK EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
ANALYSIS
This DSA updates the previous DSA prepared in early 2006 (Country Report No. 06/63).
Since then, Tajikistan has received debt relief from the IMF under the MDRI (SDR 69.3
million), and contracted $604 million of debt from China to finance projects in the
infrastructure and energy sectors. In addition, the government of Tajikistan intends to
contract $400 million of debt from China to build new hydroelectric power stations.
Therefore, despite the MDRI relief, debt distress risk has increased significantly and could
be now classified as high. Under the baseline scenario, the ratios of NPV of debt to GDP,
exports, and revenue breach their policy-dependent thresholds in the medium term, although
they improve over time. The ratio of NPV of debt to exports, however, is projected to remain
above the threshold throughout the projected period. The breach of the thresholds is more
severe under stress tests reflecting potential macroeconomic shocks, including falling short
of projected growth, and additional significant borrowing. The ratios for debt service
payments to exports and revenue are expected to remain below the thresholds under the
baseline scenario. However, under stress tests and alternative scenarios, these ratios would
also breach the thresholds.
Data and Methodology1
1.
The DSA focuses mainly on external public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) debt.
Government and government guaranteed debt includes debt directly contracted or guaranteed
by the government,2 and partially includes public sector nonguaranteed debt.3 To the extent
that the information on the stock of private debt is available from the authorities (in 2005 the
NBT started compiling inventory of external private sector debt not guaranteed by the
government), it is incorporated into the DSA. As for domestic debt, domestic securitized
public debt stands at $53 million and consists of government securities of $47 million held
1

This DSA was conducted jointly by Fund and World Bank staff and in collaboration with the authorities,
using the debt sustainability framework for low-income countries. It has benefited from Fund and Bank staff
consultations with the Ministry of Finance (MoF) during missions to Dushanbe in October–November 2006 and
January 2007, and included a full reconciliation of debt data. The Low-Income Countries (LICs) DSA uses (a)
the current year exports as denominators for estimating debt-to-exports ratio; (b) the WEO exchange rate
projections for estimating debt stocks and debt service; and (c) a 5 percent discount rate.
2

Tajikistan has some “disputed” government guaranteed debt from the period prior to 1998, when guarantees
were issued in ad hoc manner; the estimated amount of guarantees is about $50 million. In 1999, the issuance of
guarantees was centralized at the MoF. The disputed guarantees were not included in the DSA given that exact
terms, conditions, and government repayment obligations were not known at the time of this analysis. However,
even if these guarantees were recognized as valid, given the small amount involved (about 6 percent of total
public and publicly guaranteed debt at end-2006), including them in the DSA would not materially change the
main results.

3

Coverage of public sector nonguaranteed debt is limited to debt on which debt service is likely to be assumed
by the government.

32

by the NBT and government guarantees to finance the cotton sector of $7 million.4 At
present, given its small size, incorporating domestic debt into the analysis will not materially
affect the results of the DSA. However, in the future, the evolution of public domestic debt
will need to be monitored closely with the view to incorporating it into the DSA.
II.

Tajikistan’s External Debt Situation

2.
Tajikistan has continued to meet its external debt obligations on a timely basis,
while seeking relief from its creditors. Since a large share of loans has been provided on a
concessional basis, debt service obligations remain manageable. In 2006, Tajikistan
obtained rescheduling of debt from Iran—no debt service payments are expected until 2008
on a $25 million loan, and maturity was extended by two years to 9 years—and
Uzbekistan—$8 million of debt service payment in 2006 and 2007 were rescheduled to
2008.
3.
Debt relief under MDRI and the contracting of loans from China were two
major developments in 2006 that affected the external debt situation in Tajikistan. In
January 2006, Tajikistan qualified for debt relief from the IMF under MDRI and was
granted debt relief amounting to SDR 69.3 million ($100 million).5 Following debt relief,
however, Tajikistan contracted debt from China in the amount of $604 million to finance
projects in the infrastructure and energy sectors.6 While the debt was granted on
concessional terms, with a 40 percent grant element, its size (25 percent of 2006 GDP) and
uncertainty regarding the economic impact of the projects increased risks to debt
sustainability.7 However, with no disbursement on loans from China in 2006, the nominal
PPG debt-to-GDP ratio continued to decline, reaching 31 percent at the end of the year
mainly on account of strong GDP growth and debt relief.
4.
In 2007, the contracting of an additional $400 million of debt from China is
expected to increase risk of debt problems in the medium term. The authorities have
indicated that they are pursuing additional financing from China for the construction of new
hydropower plants. While concessional terms are expected, the exact details of financing
agreement have not been worked out yet. Regardless of the terms, the rapid accumulation of
4

However, given the large size of government deposits at the NBT, the NBT remains a net debtor to the
government.

5

Debt relief was granted on the basis that Tajikistan’s income per capita was below $380 in 2004. Under
MDRI, Tajikistan was provided debt relief on the stock of outstanding debt as of end-2004.

6

$281.2 million loan was contracted by the government to finance the construction of the road connecting
Dushanbe and the northern part of Tajikistan. Two loans—$267.2 million for construction of a North-South
electricity transmission line and $58.1 million for construction of Lolazor-Khatlon electricity transmission
lines—were contracted for on-lending to Barki Tajik, which is expected to service the debt.
7

While preliminary indications are that the projects will increase Tajikistan’s growth and export potential, a
thorough analysis to assess the economic impact of the projects has not been undertaken yet.

33

debt will further increase risks to debt sustainability (see the baseline scenario). It is
estimated that following the disbursement of loans from China, the nominal PPG debt-toGDP ratio will increase to 57 percent of GDP by 2009, or by 26 percentage points in three
years, remaining, however, below its 2000 level of 96 percent.
5.
A potential bail out of the cotton sector by the government poses additional risk
to debt sustainability. Political pressure has been building up to provide financing to
agriculture (cotton sector), as reflected in the recent decision by the NBT to contract
$10 million debt from China for on-lending to agriculture. By various estimates, the debt
accumulated by the cotton sector ranges between $90 and $300 million. While the
resolution of the debt issue has been on the agenda of the government, no clear-cut solution
has emerged yet. Given that the government assigns high social importance to the cotton
sector, there is a probability that the government will assume the debt, at least partially, or
will subsidize future lending to the sector. This DSA tests the worst case scenario under
which the government assumes $300 million.8
III.

Baseline Scenario

6.
The baseline scenario, developed on a realistic set of assumptions about
economic policies and outcomes (Box 1), shows that Tajikistan’s debt is sustainable,
but is at a high risk of debt distress. According to the latest three-year average World
Bank’s CPIA rating, Tajikistan’s policies and institutions are assessed as those
corresponding to a “poor performer.”9 The debt-burden thresholds for countries in this
category are (a) NPV of debt-to-exports of goods and services of 100 percent; (b) NPV of
debt-to-GDP of 30 percent; and (c) NPV of debt-to-fiscal revenue of 200 percent. The
relevant debt service thresholds are (a) 15 percent of exports of goods and services; and (b)
25 percent of revenues.

8

Although this is an unlikely scenario, this could also be a proxy for a stress test for additional concessional
lending.

9

The three-year average of CPIA ratings is used according to recently issued guidelines on DSA for LIC. These
guidelines aim at a more conservative and less volatile assessment of risk than that based on a single latest
CPIA rating. For Tajikistan, however, the use of the latest CPIA ratings would not substantially change the
assessment of risk in this DSA. Indeed, according to the latest 2005 CPIA rating, Tajikistan is placed into a
“medium performer” category implying higher policy dependent thresholds. However, even these thresholds are
breached in the medium term—albeit by a smaller margin—pointing to increased risk to debt sustainability.

34

Box 1. Tajikistan: Macroeconomic Assumptions
Real GDP is projected to grow at about 8 percent per year until 2011, and at 6.5 percent between 2012 and
2026. This figure is slightly above its ten-year historical average of 6.1 percent, but well below its latest fiveyear (post-Russian crisis) average of 9.4 percent. Growth is driven by exports, FDI, and expanding
nontraditional sectors (services, textiles, and noncotton agriculture), as well as continued inflows of remittances.
Exports of goods and services are projected to grow at a rate of 10 percent through 2012, reflecting expansion
in nontraditional sectors and strong external demand, and at 7 percent thereafter as the economy will be
expanding following large investments in the energy sector, and in response to a stable macroeconomic
environment and significant progress with structural reforms.
The current account deficit is expected to deteriorate sharply in 2007–2009 due to the increase in imports
financed by loans from China, but will improve in 2010 following the completion of the projects. Thereafter,
the current account deficit is expected to remain at about 4 percent as imports and exports are expected to grow
at the same pace and financing will be constrained to official financing on concessional terms and stable FDI
inflows. The net foreign transfer inflows (driven by remittances) are assumed to remain strong but decline from
36 to 20 percent of GDP from 2006 to 2026. The reserve coverage of imports is projected to build up gradually
to three months of imports by 2026.
The fiscal stance continues to be prudent. During 2006–2010, revenues excluding grants will increase from
19.3 to 19.5 percent of GDP, and then further to 21 percent by 2026. Expenditure, excluding foreign-financed
PIP, will increase at the same pace leaving the fiscal deficit broadly unchanged.
Official external loan financing (on concessional terms) is projected to peak at 15.4 percent of GDP in 2008
and then decline to 4 percent by 2010 and remain at that level thereafter.

7.
Under the baseline scenario, three of Tajikistan’s external debt burden
indicators are projected to breach policy-dependent thresholds following the rapid
disbursement of loans from China (Table 1 and Figure 1). In particular, by 2009 the
NPV of debt-to-exports of goods and services ratio will reach 186 percent, exceeding the
threshold of 100 percent by a significant margin. The NPV of debt-to-GDP will be at
44 percent, also significantly exceeding the 30 percent threshold, and NPV of debt-torevenue will reach 227 percent exceeding the 200 percent threshold as well. By 2026,
however, these ratios are expected to decline to 136, 23, and 107 percent, respectively. The
NPV of debt-to-export ratio, however, while on a declining path, will remain above its
threshold over the years, underscoring the importance of implementing the relevant
structural reforms targeted at increasing the GDP and export potential of Tajikistan.10
8.
External debt service ratios are expected to stay below their thresholds over the
entire period. During the projected period, debt service payments continue to be
manageable, with the assumption that all of Tajikistan’s external public and publicly
guaranteed debt has been contracted on concessional terms, albeit spiking during the years
when principal payments on loans from China fall due. In particular, the debt service-torevenue ratio would remain comfortably below 25 percent, peaking in 2014 at 17 percent
10

Substantially lower than projected net foreign transfer inflows in the outer years (for example, due to a
deteriorating regional economic situation) would likely lower imports, exports, and real GDP growth, with a
possibility of the NPV of debt-to-export ratio marginally exceeding its policy-relevant threshold in those years.

35

and declining thereafter to 11 percent. The debt service-to-export ratio will peak at
14 percent (slightly below the 15 percent threshold), but then decline to 6 percent.
IV.

Alternative Scenarios and Bound Tests

9.
The historical scenario is based on averages from 1998 to 2005, and thus
reflects a period of macroeconomic consolidation, some progress with structural
reforms, and debt reduction.11 During 1998–2005, the current account deficit was
relatively small as financing was limited, and growth was high as the economy was growing
from a low level. Therefore, under this scenario, not only do all debt burden ratios remain
well below the threshold indicators, they also follow a downward trend throughout the
projection period. While the scenario illustrates the importance of preserving
macroeconomic stability, progress with structural reforms and continued prudent debt
management, the scenario is not very useful as a benchmark against which the current debt
situation can be assessed because both the conditions of the economy and its external
environment have changed dramatically.
10.
A scenario incorporating an additional $300 million borrowing on concessional
terms in 2007 to bail out the cotton sector shows increased risk of debt distress
compared to the baseline scenario. In particular, all ratios, except the one for debt serviceto-revenue, will breach their respective thresholds. The ratios of NPV of debt to GDP,
exports, and revenue follow the baseline pattern, but exceed the thresholds sooner and by
higher margin compared to the baseline scenario. The ratio of debt service-to-exports
breaches its 15 percent threshold in 2012–13, but then declines by the end of the projection
period (Table 2 and Figure 1).
11.
A high-investment low-growth scenario underscores the risk to debt
sustainability of the current debt-based development strategy. Rapid accumulation of
debt together with uncertainty regarding the impact of investments financed by China on
growth tests the robustness of the conclusions of the baseline scenario. This alternative
scenario shows that if growth were to come at half the rate forecasted by the authorities, all
ratios, except for the debt service-to-revenue, will breach and remain above or very close to
their respective thresholds. Moreover, the ratio of NPV of debt-to-export increases and
becomes unsustainable (Table 3 and Figure 1).
12.
A relaxation of the authorities’ current prudent approach to contracting
external debt only on concessional terms, would lead to a deterioration of Tajikistan’s
external debt indicators compared to the baseline scenario. If all new borrowing were to
be contracted on less than concessional terms during the projection period, Tajikistan’s
NPV debt-to-GDP ratio would rise substantially. Specifically, with the increase in the
11

The 1995–97 period has been excluded from historical average scenario due to disruptions from civil war.

deflator in $ terms, export growth, net transfers and FDI to GDP ratios.

average interest rate on new disbursements by 2 percentage points, the NPV of debt-to-GDP
ratio would rise to 50 percent by 2009 and slowly decline afterwards to 34 percent by 2026
remaining above 30 percent threshold throughout the projected period. The ratios of NPV of
debt-to-exports and debt service-to-exports would peak at 215 and 19 percent, respectively,
and remain above their thresholds at a roughly steady level during the projected period. The
NPV of debt-to revenue ratio will peak at 261 percent in 2009, but then decline to
162 percent at the end of the projected period (Table 4 and Figure 1).
13.
Bound tests show that adverse macroeconomic shocks would also have a
profound negative impact on Tajikistan’s external position. In the event of a combined
shock (to real GDP growth, exports growth, FDI inflows), all ratios would exceed the
policy-dependent thresholds by a significant margin. In particular, Tajikistan’s NPV of
debt-to-GDP ratio would rise to 109 percent by 2009, falling below the policy-dependent
threshold of 30 percent only by 2026. The same shock would also significantly worsen the
NPV of debt-to-revenues ratio, which would jump to 565 percent in 2009 and stay above
the threshold of 200 percent until 2022. 12 The ratios of the NPV of debt-to exports and debt
service-to-exports would peak at 531 and 44 percent, respectively, and while on a declining
path, would remain above the thresholds throughout the projected period. Debt service-torevenue ratio would also exceed the threshold between 2013 and 2022, but would decline
below the threshold after 2022.
VI.

Conclusions

14.
Tajikistan’s risk of debt distress has increased significantly and has become
high. The results of the alternative scenarios and stress tests indicate that the debt
sustainability situation could further deteriorate with negative macroeconomic shocks,
borrowing on nonconcessional terms, or incurring extra debt—even on concessional
terms—in an attempt to bail out the agricultural sector, and could become unsustainable if
growth associated with large prospective investments does not materialize. The DSA results
thus underscore the need for the authorities to exercise extreme caution in incurring extra
debt and vetting projects, strengthening their debt management capacity, including
developing “in house” capacity to conduct DSA, and making sure that external resources
are used productively. Sound macroeconomic policies and the acceleration of structural
reforms, especially in the agricultural and electricity sectors, would also be essential for
maintaining debt sustainability. By contributing to higher export and output growth, these
measures would reduce Tajikistan’s vulnerability to exogenous shocks.

12

Since Tajikistan is a small open economy with a high share of exports-to-GDP, the debt-to-revenue indicator
is an important measure of debt vulnerabilities.

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock
(implicitely assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Safeguards Assessment

The previous safeguards assessment of the NBT was completed on July 23, 2003, which
proposed specific measures to address a number of weaknesses, as reported in Country
Report No. 03/222. Under the Fund’s safeguards assessment policy, while safeguards
assessments are optional under the PSI, central banks may undertake such assessments as a
way of enhancing their accountability, transparency, and institutional strength, and
facilitating quick access to Fund resources in the event of need.
X.

Exchange Rate Arrangements

The NBT maintains a managed floating exchange rate regime with no preannounced path for
the exchange rate. Since August 2005, the NBT has increased the frequency of calculating
and announcing the official exchange rate from a weekly to a daily basis. The official
exchange rate is based on all interbank transactions in foreign exchange.
With effect from December 9, 2004, the Republic of Tajikistan accepted the obligations of
Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Articles of Agreement. As a result, the Republic of
Tajikistan maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on the making of
payments and transfers for current international transactions, except for exchange restrictions
maintained for security reasons that have been notified to the Fund pursuant to Executive
Board Decision (www.imf.org).
XI.

Article IV Consultation

The 2004 Article IV consultation was completed on March 18, 2005. Tajikistan is on the

Partnership in Tajikistan’s Development Strategy

1.
The Bank’s Country Partnership Strategy, endorsed by the Bank’s Board of
Executive Directors on July 26, 2005, focuses on the following three priorities, which are in
line with the country’s PRSP:
•

To improve business opportunities in rural and urban areas

•

To enhance and preserve the quality of the human capital

•

To improve energy service delivery and increase electricity exports.

2.
In addition, in each of the above areas, the Bank Group and government agreed to
work to improve government capacity and efficiency, and reduce corruption by giving
special emphasis to measures that increase transparency of resource use, reduce discretionary
controls, and encourage the participation of users in the provision of services.
3.
Macroeconomic management aims at establishing a stable economic environment
through appropriate fiscal, monetary, exchange rate, and sustainable debt policies. In support
of these policies, the authorities are tightening payment discipline, especially in the energy
sector, hardening budget constraints for state-owned enterprises, and pursuing enterprise and
banking privatization and restructuring. Recent improvements in macroeconomic
management have supported the current economic recovery. However, to maintain strong
growth the authorities will need to accelerate structural reform to support private sector
development and investment, and encourage foreign investment.
4.
The IMF has taken the lead in assisting Tajikistan in enhancing macroeconomic
stability. The Fund has encouraged the authorities to continue with fiscal consolidation,
maintain a restrictive monetary policy, and conduct prudent debt management policy to
enhance its sustainability.
5.
The World Bank has taken the lead in the policy dialogue on structural issues,
including poverty reduction measures, agriculture sector reforms, private sector
development, institution building, budget planning, improving public service delivery, and
governance. A range of instruments is used to conduct the dialogue. Policy based lending and
technical assistance are supporting reforms in a number of sectors. The Programmatic
Development Policy Credit Financing (PDPC)—three year development policy financing
program to support government’s medium-term reform program—was approved in July 6,
2006; it is supporting the government in the areas of public administration reform, public
expenditure management, social service delivery and private sector development.

7
6.
This broad-based approach is combined with sector projects in health, education,
municipal infrastructure, power, agriculture, environment, and poverty alleviation. Over the
last three years the following studies have been prepared and finalized: the Country
Procurement Assessment Review, the Country Financial Accountability Assessment, a Trade
Diagnostic Study, an Investment Climate Assessment, Regional Energy Export Potential
Study, a Note on Public Sector Wages, the Public Expenditure and Institutional Review,
Aviation Sector Note and a Note on development Impact of Remittances. Within Fast Track
Initiative (FTI) framework and in anticipation of a sector wide reform currently a Fiduciary
Capacity Assessment is being finalized to enable gradual integration and implementation of
the donor-funded public investment projects in education. The Bank has recently launched
Programmatic Public Expenditure Review and within it a Public Expenditure Tracking
Survey in Health and Education, as well as spending efficiency in these two sectors. With
support of DFID financing—and technical supervision of the Bank—the Government has
adopted a plan to implement Medium-Term Budget Framework which initially will be
piloted in Education for the 2008 budget. With Swiss support the Bank has launched the first
Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) Assessment in September 2006.
The Bank is supporting the development of a Private Sector Development (PSD) Strategy in
close coordination with the Government and the Donor Coordination Council in Tajikistan.

World Bank Collaboration in Specific Areas

Areas in which the World Bank leads and there is little direct IMF involvement
7.
Areas in which the Bank leads and there is no direct IMF involvement are social
sectors, infrastructure and environment. In the social sphere, the Bank has carried out regular
Poverty Assessments to monitor poverty and develop programs to alleviate poverty. Based on
the completed Living Standards Survey (2003), a Poverty Assessment Update Report has
been prepared. Two Poverty Alleviation Projects have supported capacity development at the
national and local levels to implement participatory approaches to poverty alleviation and
improve the access of the poor to essential economic and social services. In addition, the
second Poverty Alleviation Project has provided support to vulnerable people through
microprojects, microfinance services, and community empowerment. The Bank has been
supporting within the framework of the Donor Coordination Council in Tajikistan in the
preparation of a new Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper for 2007–09, which is expected to be
completed soon. Under the Strengthening National Statistics System Project, a new Living
Standards Survey is being prepared for implementation in 2007.
8.
In education, the Bank focuses on both addressing policy issues and utilizing IDA
credit funds for investments. The ongoing Education Modernization Project (FY03) aims to
upgrade the basic education system through (a) building capacity for change by providing
continued support for strategic changes in curriculum and textbook production and
supporting improved management and finance at the national level; and (b) supporting local
initiatives for infrastructure and quality improvement, support for textbook rental schemes
and book printing, and provision of equipment at the local level. Tajikistan has also received
grant funding from the Education for All (EFA) FTI catalytic fund, administered by the
Bank. Key issues in education, apart from infrastructure rehabilitation and capacity building,
are pay reform, per capita financing and expenditure tracking. Assistance to this sector will
continue through the Programmatic Development Policy Financing (PDPF), multi-donor
education investment program, and PSRP. Bank’s involvement in education also includes
wage reform in education and gradual move towards program-based budgeting in the sector
through the PDPF. The IMF has supported the education reform process, in close
collaboration with the World Bank, through a structural benchmark requiring the drawing up
of a fully costed education reform plan by the government.
9.
In health, the Bank is focusing on (a) rationalizing the delivery of the basic health
services based on the needs of the population in selected districts, especially in remote areas
where the poorest are located; (b) reform the public health services, with particular emphasis
on prevention of major communicable diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS;
and (c) further strengthening the institutional capability (both at the center and district levels)
to carry out health care reforms, to improve the system for budgeting and spending for basic
health services, pay reform and to control outbreaks of communicable diseases and prevent
HIV/AIDS epidemic from spreading; and (c) implementation of the Basic Benefits Package,
wage reform and improving budget allocation mechanism for primary and secondary health
care. The Community and Basic Health Project and PDPF is main instruments for the
implementation of this agenda. Policy dialogue if being carried out under PDPC.

10
10.
With regard to infrastructure development, the Bank is concentrating on upgrading
basic utility services impacting the population at large and especially the poor. The
Dushanbe Water Supply Project is helping the Dushanbe Municipality and the local water
company to address the most critical deficiencies of water supply services. The Pamir
Private Power Project is supporting improvements in reliability of electricity supply in the
Gorno Badakshan region through private sector participation. The Energy Loss Reduction
Project is helping to reduce commercial losses and improve the power and gas sector
financial viability. Municipal Infrastructure Project is providing support to improve urban
infrastructure in big towns. The Bank has also been leading policy dialogue (under PDPF)
on increasing efficiency/viability to ensure long-term growth prospects of the sector.
11.
In agriculture, the Bank is concentrating on land reform, rehabilitation of irrigation
and drainage infrastructure and introduction of market rules in procurement of inputs and
marketing of outputs as well as on the resolution of the cotton farm debts. The Land
Registration and Cadastre Project is assisting the government with the land reform, issuance
of land certificates and establishment of a modern cadastre system. The Ferghana Valley
Project aims to increase water supply and efficiency of irrigation systems in the Ferghana
Valley, and develop institutional capacity in land and water resources management. The
proposed Cotton Development Project (FY07) will help provide alternative financing
mechanisms to cotton farmers. Cross cutting policy issues for increasing productivity in
cotton sectors are being addressed through the PDPF.
12.
The Bank has supported programs to improve environmental management and to
deal with natural disasters. A National Environment Action Plan was developed with the
Bank’s help. The Emergency Flood Assistance and Lake Sarez Risk Mitigation Projects have
helped the government to mitigate the consequences of frequent natural disasters and to build
national capacity to address frequent natural hazards such as mudslides, rock-falls,
avalanches, and seasonal floods.
Areas in which the World Bank leads and its analysis serves as input into the IMF
program
13.
The Bank leads the dialogue on structural reforms through the three year PDPF
currently under implementation. Institution building and technical assistance in support of
PDPF structural reforms continue to be provided by the Education Modernization project,
Land Registration and Cadastre, and the PSRP. The Bank leads in areas of:
Private sector development, including new measures for financial transparency and hard
budget constraints, establishment of a new agency to support the private sector and
improvements in the regulatory framework, and reduction of taxes on the agricultural sector.
The Bank has completed the Investment Climate Review and Agriculture Sector Review to
determine the most important impediments to private sector development. Tajikistan became
a part of Doing Business 2005 which provides insightful and cross-country comparison of
business environment in the country. The Bank has been preparing Private Sector
Development Strategy Note with the Government of Tajikistan.

11
Enterprise and farm privatization and reform, including acceleration of privatization of
medium and large enterprises, development of a plan to engage the private sector in
Tajikistan’s strategic enterprises and adoption of a strategy to privatize these enterprises in a
medium term context, improvements to the corporate governance framework public
enterprises; upgrading of the status of the Land Reform Committee to the equivalent of a
ministry and acceleration of farm privatization and enforcement of procedures to ensure the
transparency and equitable privatization of farm land; development of procedures and
institutional mechanisms at the state level and selected regions to ensure fair and equitable
transfer of land and other farm assets to private individuals or groups; creation of sustainable
private family farming units and providing them with the enabling conditions to operate
independently in a market economy. The Bank has completed the Investment Climate
Review and Agriculture Sector Review to determine the most important impediments to
unleashing the agriculture sector potential. With support of donors, the Bank has been
providing technical support to the State Property Committee to implement long-term
strategic privatization plan; initial actions in restructuring large SOEs has commenced.
Regulatory reforms, including focus on (a) changing role of Anti-monopoly Agency and
further strengthening its capacity; (b) improving inspection regime for businesses; and
(c) easy and transparent rules for business entry (licensing) and exit (bankruptcy regulation).
In addition to that, separation of policy making and technical regulators functions in aviation
sector is a subject of on-going reforms under PDPC. Actions in this area also include initial
steps towards separation of airline, airport and air traffic control to improve access to
Tajikistan. The discussion on the Review of the Air Transport Sector in Tajikistan has
provided the basis for further reforms in this area.
14.
While the Bank has taken the lead in privatization and in structural reforms in the
private sector as described above, the IMF has also a strong interest in these areas since
many of these reforms are critical to achieving macroeconomic stabilization and enhancing
growth prospects. Accordingly, there is a high degree of consultation and coordination
between the two institutions on these matters.
Areas of shared responsibility
15.
The Bank and the Fund are working jointly in the following four main areas
(supported by the Bank’s PDPF, grants, and several investment operations and the Fund’s
PRGF):
•

Public sector management. The Bank has provided technical support to the
Government of Tajikistan to develop a comprehensive public administration reform
strategy. It includes policy actions in public administration reforms aimed at
redefining the role of the state in line with the market economy needs, reorganizing
key ministries, strengthening the State Financial Control Committee responsible for
budget audits, and supporting the pay reform. The Bank is involved in civil service
reform while the Fund is providing technical assistance in support of tax and customs
administration and treasury management.

12
•

Budget planning and execution. Both institutions work on providing support for a
national Treasury, adoption of new Law on Public Finances introducing modern
budgetary procedures and improved fiscal management; including Public Investment
Program and switching from norm-based costing and allocation of expenditures to
activity/population based in education and health sectors. The Bank will continue to
provide technical support, and mobilize donor funds, to implement the Medium-Term
Budget Framework (MTBF) that was approved by the Government in September
2006. The Bank will also continue to support public financial external and internal
control reform through the PDPC, IDFs, and PSRP. Treasury reform will be
supported by the forthcoming PFM project (FY08).

•

Financial sector reforms. This area includes the acceleration of financial sector
restructuring and closure of weak banks, new regulatory framework for the
establishment of non-bank intermediaries; significant changes in the tax code making
tax authorities’ access to bank accounts conditional on a court authorization. In terms
of banking supervision, the IMF is monitoring the closure and merger of banks that
do not satisfy prudential requirements. The first FSAP for Tajikistan is being planned
in collaboration with the IMF for the first quarter of 2007.

•

Utilities reform. The Fund has included in the PRGC arrangement conditionality
related to energy tariff rates, energy arrears and collection rates with the aim to
reduce quasi-fiscal activities and increase transparency. The Bank’s program supports
this objective, with a focus on enhancing market structures, improved enterprise
operation, service delivery, as well as financial performance through PDPC. The
Bank completed an Energy Sector Utility Reform Review in 2004. The Review
described the financial condition of the energy sector enterprises and detailed the
Bank’s medium-term energy sector development strategy. The Bank also approved
the Energy Loss Reduction Project to help implement the energy sector strategy. It is
also working closely together with the Asian Development Bank and the EBRD in the
areas of utilities reform and restructuring of strategic enterprises such as the railways
and airlines.

•

Debt sustainability analysis: The Bank and the IMF have started carrying out joint
DSAs. The first one was done in early 2006 and a follow up update was completed in
February 2007.

13
Areas in which the IMF leads and its analysis serves as input into the World Bank
program
16.
The Fund leads the dialogue on fiscal matters, setting the overall envelope for public
expenditures. The World Bank’s work in key sectors, such as health, education and
infrastructure, necessitates close cooperation. In addition to the achievement of overall fiscal
targets, the Fund-supported PRGF includes structural benchmarks and performance criteria
prohibiting the NBT from issuing directed credit, from making expenditures not related to its
core business activities, and from paying dividends while it has negative net worth. This also
includes finalization of an inventory of guarantees, pledges, and other contingencies of NBT.
17.
In the budgetary area, the Fund is taking the lead on tax reforms and treasury systems
development. The IMF also leads the dialogue on polices to rationalize and contain
expenditures in the public sector. These include policies regarding wage setting in both the
public service, and defining the ceiling for public investment expenditures.
18.
In these areas, the Bank takes into account the policy recommendations of the IMF
and ensures that its own policy advice is consistent.
Areas in which the IMF leads and there is no direct World Bank involvement
19.
The Fund takes the lead in the formulation and execution of fiscal and monetary
policies, tax policy, external trade policies, and issues involving economic and financial
statistics. However, the World Bank has recently provided an IDA project and catalyzed
other donors’ financing for the Strengthening National Statistics System Project.
III.

IDA Funding

20.
IDA funding to Tajikistan was provided in the form of 100 percent grant in FY06;
FY07 allocation is set with a 45 percent grant component. Tajikistan’s eligibility for grants in
outer years will be determined based on the annual Debt Sustainability Analyses. The
indicative FY06–09 IDA funding is about SDR102 million; the FY06 allocation was SDR
30 million, FY07 allocation is around SDR 26 million.

ANNEX III:TAJIKISTAN—RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
(As of February 15, 2007)
Country Director: Mr. Neeraj Jain—Telephone: 992-372-210558/235314/235315
1.
Tajikistan became a member of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in 1998. The
ADB has participated in the Consultative Group Meeting for Tajikistan since 1998. After
conducting an initial mission in June 1998, ADB completed an Economic Report and Interim
Operational Strategy that identified three areas: (a) agriculture; (b) infrastructure
rehabilitation (especially energy and transport sectors); and (c) social sector, in which ADB
assistance would have the greatest development impact. Based on the Interim Strategy,
ADB’s Board of Directors approved in October 1998 Tajikistan’s country classification,
which provides the basis for Tajikistan’s full access to concessional resources (Asian
Development Fund (ADF)). Based on the new ADF replenishment arrangements completed
in 2004, Tajikistan is eligible for receiving 40 percent of the loan amount on grant basis after
2005.
2.
In view of Tajikistan’s urgent need for assistance in 1998, in coordination with the
IMF and the World Bank (WB), the ADB provided a Post-conflict Infrastructure Program
Loan ($20 million), which was designed to create a framework for developing market-based
transport and energy sectors. The loan was for two years and was fully disbursed by end2000. Based on the satisfactory progress of the Post-conflict Infrastructure Program loan
conditionality, the following loans were approved in these two sectors:
3.
Transport Sector: the Road Rehabilitation Project loan ($20 million in 2000), which
rehabilitates the most deteriorated sections of the Dushanbe—Kulyab road in the southern
part of Tajikistan, the most civil-war affected areas; and Dushanbe—Kyrgyz Border Road
Rehabilitation Project loans (first phase of $15 million in 2003 and second phase of
$30 million in 2005), which improves Tajikistan’s transportation link toward north and east
through Kyrgyz Republic, further to Kazakhstan and Russia, as well as to China. These
projects also improve rural roads in the project areas. Continued supports in strengthening
the government’s institutional capacity for efficient management of national road network
are provided under technical assistance grants associated with these loans and provided on
stand-alone basis.
4.
Power Sector: the Power Rehabilitation Project loan ($34 million in 2000) aims to
improve people’s quality of life and support poverty reduction by increasing the availability
of electricity, and assist in post-conflict recovery of Tajikistan’s economy (the project
rehabilitates and reinforces power transmission and distribution facilities in the war-damaged
areas in Khatlon and Dushanbe regions, and rehabilitates the Nurek Power Plant and Central
Hydropower Plant); and the Regional Power Transmission Modernization Project loan
($20 million in 2002) is geared towards improving the reliability and the operation of the
Central Asian power transmission system, enhancing the intercountry power trading between
Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, and laying the foundation for a future wholesale regional power
market. The later loan had to be cancelled due to the inability of Tajikistan and Uzbekistan
agreeing on the Power Trade Agreement. Various technical assistance projects were provided

15
to accelerate market-oriented reforms in the power sector also in line with IMF and WB
programs and for supporting the government in formulating a power sector development
strategy. The Tajikistan Afghanistan Power Transmission and Interconnection Project loan is
being prepared for ADB Board approval in 2006.
5.
In addition to the above, the ADB Board approved to date the following loans to
Tajikistan in each sector:
6.
Social Sector: the Social Sector Rehabilitation Project loan ($20 million in 1999) to
address the serious deterioration in living standards and strengthen the delivery of essential
social services; the Health Sector Reform Project loan ($7.5 million in 2003), which aims to
improve health, especially of the poor, women, and children by providing pro-poor health
service package, and by reforming the health service delivery and financing mechanism; and
the Education Sector Reform Project loan ($7.5 million in 2003), which focuses on
supporting the government’s reform priorities in primary (grades 1–4) and general secondary
education (grades 5–11) by improving the education system and its management. These two
social sector reform loans are being supported by respective grants financed by Japan Fund
for Poverty Reduction (JFPR): (a) the project for Community Participation and Public
Information Campaign for Health Improvement ($1 million in 2004); and (b) the School
Improvement Project ($2 million in 2004), which aims to increase access to improved
education for children, particularly girls, of poor families and vulnerable groups.
7.
Agriculture Sector: based on the agriculture sector assessment prepared during
1999–2000, the Agriculture Rehabilitation Project loan ($35 million in 2002) is being
implemented to improve living conditions of the farming communities in the project area and
to institute measures to sustain benefits of improvements for irrigation and drainage systems
and water supply, as well as by providing farm production support services. In order to
support the agriculture sector reforms, the TA for Farm Debt Resolution and Policy Reforms,
which is associated with the loan, has been implemented in consultation with the IMF,
involving a wide range of stakeholders. Based on the findings of the TA, ADB supported the
government in close cooperation with other donors and NGOs for formulating a National
Farm Debt Resolution Strategy. A wide range of donor assistance is now needed as the
Strategy has been announced by the government. ADB, in collaboration with DFID, is
supporting donor coordination for implementing the Strategy. A road map with clearly
defined actions, time frame, and results is currently being developed to improve coordination
among donors and between donors and the authorities in implementation of the Strategy.
Grant assistance for Rural Poverty Reduction Project ($2.9 million in 2001) financed by
JFPR has supported the loan preparation and implementation by pilot testing innovative
poverty-oriented on- and off-farm supports. In 2004, Irrigation Rehabilitation Project loan
was approved for $22.7 million. In a major push supporting the agriculture sector and rural
development, Sustainable Cotton sub-Sector Project loan and Rural Development Project
loan are being prepared for ADB Board approval in 2006.
8.
Finance: Microfinance Systems Development Program loan ($4 million in 2003) to
support policy, legal, and regulatory reforms; and Microfinance Systems Development

16
Project loan ($4 million in 2003) to help transform nongovernmental organization
microfinance programs into licensed and regulated microfinance institutions.
9.
Trade Facilitation: the Regional Trade Facilitation and Customs Cooperation
Program loan ($10 million in 2002), which supports trade and customs reform development
across the East and Central Asia. Regional Customs Modernization and Infrastructure
Development ($10.7 million in 2004) to promote international trade and enabling
environment for private sector development.
10.
Emergency Assistance: in response to the government’s urgent requests, three
emergency loans, including the Emergency Flood Rehabilitation Project loan ($5 million in
1999), the Emergency Restoration of Yavan Water Conveyance System loan ($3.6 million in
2001), and the Emergency Baipaza Landslide Stabilization Project loan ($5.3 million in
2002) were approved.
11.
As of August 2006, in addition to the above 18 loans, totaling $264.4 million, and
6 JFPR grant projects, totaling $10.2 million, ADB provided 46 technical assistance grants,
totaling $23.1 million to support policy reforms, capacity building, and project
implementation.
12.
In end-2000, ADB started supporting the government in developing PRSP through
participatory approach under a TA grant in close cooperation with the IMF, WB, and UNDP.
Following the finalization of the PRSP in June 2002, ADB concluded the Poverty
Partnership Agreement (PPA) with the government in December 2002, and proceeded to
prepare a new five-year Country Strategy and Program (CSP) for 2004–08 for Tajikistan,
which was endorsed by the ADB Board in October 2003. Its main objectives are (a) to
strengthen rural development through institution building that will support policy
implementation and the private sector; (b) to rehabilitate power and rural infrastructure; and
(c) to strengthen regional cooperation through improved customs services and transport links,
both within the country and neighboring ones.
13.
ADB prepares and updates its three-year rolling programs for Tajikistan every year in
consultation with the government based on the ADF resources availability, carefully
examining the country’s social and economic development status and in coordination with
other donors, including IMF. The Country Strategy Update for 2006–08 was approved by the
Board in August 2005. The Update for 2007–2009 is currently under preparation. ADB pays
full attention to the progress of Tajikistan’s MDG achievement. ADB is paying intensive
attention to governance reforms through investment projects and technical assistance. In
2006, ADB is leading a multi-donor consortium for a technical assistance project entitled
Strengthening Results Management in Support of Poverty Reduction in Tajikistan. In 2007,
ADB would launch significant technical assistance for implementation of the Private Sector
Development Strategy for Tajikistan. ADB is also currently preparing Tax Administration
Modernization and Governance Enhancement Project loan for ADB Board approval in 2007.
The total country indicative planning figure of ADF lending level for Tajikistan is
$88.5 million including $31.0 million in grants for 2007–09 including. Moreover, Tajikistan

17
will be a potential candidate for regional projects amounting to $85 million over 2007–09. In
addition, nonlending operations are proposed for $4.9 million over 2007–08. These exclude
cofinancing. The actual lending level will be determined by (a) availability of overall ADF
resources; (b) country performance assessment vis-à-vis ADB’s policy on performance based
allocation of ADF resources; and (c) processing status of the projects in the pipeline.

18
ANNEX IV: TAJIKISTAN—STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance purposes. Tajikistan began
participation in the GDDS in November 2004 and the country page in the International
Financial Statistics (IFS) has been published since February 2003.
2.
The authorities have indicated their interest in subscribing to the Fund’s SDDS. They
have appointed a national SDDS coordinator and requested technical assistance for this
purpose. Before subscribing to the SDDS, Tajikistan will need to compile and disseminate
the following datasets: quarterly national accounts, template on international reserves and
foreign currency liquidity, and international investment position. Also, Tajikistan will need
to disseminate regularly general government operations that include special funds (extrabudgetary accounts) at least on an annual basis, quarterly central government debt, monthly
gross international reserves, and quarterly external debt data, with improved timeliness for
several data categories.
3.
The data ROSC mission in April 2004 found that the consumer price index,
government finance statistics (GFS), and monetary statistics broadly follow sound
methodologies. The mission also noted that source data are well-developed in all areas of
statistics, and that suitable processes for assessment and validation of source data are in
place. However, further efforts to improve the quality of economic statistics are limited by
tight budgetary constraints.
National Accounts and Price Statistics
4.
The ROSC mission identified significant deficiencies in statistical techniques for
national accounts and price statistics, most notably in procedures to estimate the informal
economy, and in the techniques for imputation, replacement, quality adjustment, and
introduction of new products in the price indices. In addition, an intensified effort is needed
to strengthen the scope, classification/sectorization, and basis of recording of the national
accounts, and to reconsider the concepts and basis of recording underlying the producer price
index (PPI).
Fiscal Statistics
5.
The government finance statistics are based on cash transactions as recommended in
A Manual on Government Finance Statistics, 1986. Although there are no plans at present to
migrate the basis of compilation to the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001, the cash
GFS operations data were reported in the new framework for inclusion in the 2005 GFS
Yearbook, although no details on financing of the cash deficit were reported. Data with a
higher frequency for inclusion in the IFS are not reported.

19
Monetary and Financial Statistics
6.
A monetary and financial statistics mission visited Tajikistan in early 2006 and
assisted the authorities in establishing the procedures for compiling analytical accounts for
commercial banks using data collected from the revised chart of accounts. The mission also
assisted the authorities in implementing the Standardized Report Forms (SRFs) developed by
STA. The authorities resumed regular reporting of monthly monetary data to STA for
publication in IFS shortly after the mission. Further efforts are needed to implement the SRFs
and the mission’s other recommendations for improving the collection, compilation, and
dissemination.
Balance of Payments Statistics
7.
There is a need for consistency in applying the residency concept in the balance of
payments and the national accounts, and the scope of the foreign trade data needs to be
improved to cover the shuttle trade.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2006 Article IV Consultation with the
Republic of Tajikistan
On March 28, 2007, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with the Republic of Tajikistan.1
Background
While the recent strong growth performance continued in 2006, inflation accelerated. Despite
considerable disruptions to energy supply late in the year, real GDP growth reached 7 percent,
fueled by a surge in construction activity and continuing strong remittance-financed demand for
retail services. However, CPI-inflation reached 12.7 percent, its highest level since 2003, mostly
because of failed harvests and higher gas prices, but also reflecting a relatively passive
monetary policy stance. High aluminum prices and strong growth in nontraditional exports and
workers’ remittances did not translate into a commensurate improvement in the external
accounts, as higher energy prices and strong demand for consumer and capital goods led to a
surge in imports. Gross reserves remain relatively low, at the equivalent of two months of
imports.
Fiscal policy remained prudent. Reflecting strong revenue performance and cautious fiscal
management, the 2006 budget recorded a surplus, continuing the impressive fiscal performance
of the past four years. While Tajikistan’s external debt profile has improved significantly—mostly
as a result of debt restructuring operations and relief under the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
—on current trends, total public and publicly guaranteed debt is projected to increase
significantly over the period of 2006–2009, mainly because of large project–related
disbursements from China.
Progress in the structural reform area has been mixed. The authorities have been successfully
implementing tax administration and public financial management reforms. While further
headway has been made in strengthening the banking sector, it remains small and vulnerable,
and public disclosure requirements continue to be inadequate. In the energy sector, important
steps have been taken to align tariffs with costs; however, structural and regulatory weaknesses
continue to undermine its potential. Agricultural reforms are on going, although finding a solution
to the debt overhang in the cotton sector is still an outstanding policy issue. Enhancing growth
prospects will also require improving the private investment climate. In this vein, the forthcoming
second Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper is expected to address some of these issues.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for their progress in stabilizing the economy and
their implementation of sound economic policies and structural reforms that have contributed to
high rates of economic growth. Together with debt relief and macroeconomic stability, strong
growth has led to significant progress toward meeting the Millennium Development Goals,
including poverty reduction. At the same time, Directors observed that major challenges remain.
Inflation pressures have resurfaced, debt sustainability could become a concern with rising
indebtedness, and poverty remains widespread.
Directors commended the authorities for their strong fiscal performance in 2006. They urged the
authorities to continue to implement a sound fiscal policy in 2007 and save any revenue
overperformance, particularly since inflation is on an upward trend and the debt dynamics are
worsening. Directors encouraged the authorities to refrain from adopting a supplementary
budget until the inflation picture improves. Directors welcomed the significant progress achieved
in the areas of tax administration, civil service reform, and public financial management.
Nevertheless, the authorities need to address urgently remaining weaknesses in tax compliance
and the financial monitoring of state enterprises.
Directors underscored the importance of controlling inflation. The macroeconomic policy
framework should be buttressed not only by a strong fiscal position and a flexible exchange
rate, but also by a tighter monetary stance. In this context, the balance sheet of the central bank
needs to be placed on a firmer footing to give more flexibility and credibility to monetary policy.
Directors advised the central bank to refrain from providing directed credits to the agricultural
sector. Any financial resources directed to the private sector, particularly if subsidized, should
be channeled through the budget in a transparent manner.
Directors supported the current managed float exchange rate regime, which they considered
has served Tajikistan well. They encouraged the authorities to limit intervention in the foreign
exchange market to smoothing operations and shoring up reserve coverage.

3
Directors observed that the authorities’ development strategy, centered on financing essential
infrastructure investments through large and rapidly disbursing project loans at concessional
interest rates, could entail risks to debt sustainability in the longer term if the expected
concomitant acceleration in growth does not materialize. In addition, many Directors cautioned
that the rapid debt accumulation could place additional pressure on the budget, as significant
counterpart funds would be needed, which could reduce resources available for other priority
sectors and affect macroeconomic performance. Against that background, Directors welcomed
the authorities’ intention to put in place a debt management strategy that will prevent public debt
from exceeding 60 percent of GDP.
Directors considered that the authorities’ medium-term growth objectives are ambitious but
achievable. Reaching these goals will require determination on the part of the government to
address long-standing policy issues in the agricultural and energy sectors, intensify efforts to
improve the private investment climate, promote the channeling of the large volume of private
remittances to the most productive uses, and enhance the governance framework for stateowned enterprises. Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to focus the second poverty
reduction strategy paper on efforts to improve the private investment climate and move forward
with the public sector reform program.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to continue with the reforms of core
macroeconomic institutions. They looked forward to even closer cooperation and discussion
between the authorities and the staff in the period ahead, with a view to the design of a program
that could elicit Fund support.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by Thomas Moser, Executive Director for Republic of Tajikistan
March 28, 2007
1.
My Tajik authorities would like to thank staff for the very constructive policy
dialogue. They highly appreciate the support from the Fund. As the staff report notes,
Tajikistan’s performance under two previous arrangements (1998-2005) was strong, and last
year’s Ex Post Assessment concluded that “Tajikistan’s engagement with the Fund is on
balance a success story.” The authorities fully share this view, and they would very much
appreciate a new Fund arrangement, which could play a critical role in helping to safeguard
macroeconomic stability and tackle the outstanding structural reform agenda.
Recent Developments and Economic Policies
2.
Real GDP growth has again been strong in 2006, supported by all sectors. The main
drivers, however, were the construction sector and remittances, which financed demand for
services. The surge in construction activity and the spike in energy prices further complicated
monetary policy, which already has to manage the substantial remittances inflows. The
authorities’ decision to pass through fully the cost of significantly higher gas prices and
higher food prices due to the failed harvest have contributed to the increase in inflation.
3.
While inflation is expected to recede partly, absent negative exogenous shocks, the
authorities’ objective of 7 percent inflation for 2007 will be difficult to achieve. The National
Bank of Tajikistan (NBT) is therefore considering aiming for a more credible inflation target
in the range of 8-9 percent. The authorities remain committed to a flexible exchange rate
regime and intend to limit foreign exchange interventions to smoothing exchange rate
movements. To strengthen the monetary policy framework, efforts are underway to widen the
menu of monetary policy instruments available to the NBT. A working group has recently
been established to develop the next steps. The authorities are also looking forward to the
FSAP mission and its recommendations, which will be useful for moving forward with the
restoration of the capital position of the NBT.
4.
A strong fiscal policy stance continued to be the centerpiece of macroeconomic
policy. As noted in the staff report, the 2006 budget recorded a better-than-expected surplus,
despite the election cycle, with tax revenues over-performing. It should be pointed out that
Tajikistan has achieved a remarkably successful fiscal consolidation under Fund-supported
programs. The overall fiscal balance, excluding the externally financed Public Investment
Program, turned from a deficit of about 4 percent of GDP in 1998 to surplus since 2002,
while at the same time the authorities have made good progress in reprioritizing expenditures
towards social sectors. Significant progress has also been achieved in tax administration and
public financial management, as highlighted in Boxes 3 and 4 of the staff report.

2
5.
The staff report rightly points out, however, that the implementation of some key
structural reforms is still pending, particularly in the agricultural and energy sectors. The
authorities share the staff’s view that the cotton debt problem in the agricultural sector must
be resolved. To make progress, they have endorsed on March 5, 2007, a “Road Map”
attached to the existing cotton debt strategy approved last year. The “Road Map” envisages,
among others, to eliminate interference and implicit governance of the local governments on
cotton harvesting. These efforts should help address the remaining distortions that exist
despite the crucial progress made on land reform. Given the complexity of the cotton debt
problem, the authorities continue to seek technical assistance.
6.
The Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) II draft was distributed to the donor’s
community. The main objective of PRPS II is to concentrate on improving the investment
climate, make progress with the public sector reforms, while sustaining macroeconomic
stability and reducing further poverty. The PRSP II draft will be discussed at the technical
level among donors at a meeting to be held in Switzerland in April.
The Development Strategy and the Debt Issue
7.
As pointed out in the staff report, Tajikistan has significant development potential,
particularly in the agricultural and electricity sector. Currently, however, inadequate energy
infrastructure causes severe electricity shortages, characterized by regular electricity
blackouts and many areas having only two hours of electricity per day during winter months.
In order to improve the quantity and reliability of electricity supply, the authorities have
arranged for concessional loans to construct two large electricity transmission lines and new
hydroelectricity projects. The authorities would like to point out, as the G-8 did at its 2006
Summit in St. Petersburg, that it is impossible to drastically reduce poverty, support health
services, provide clean drinking water and sanitation, promote more productive agriculture,
and secure investment in job-creating enterprises without addressing the serious energy
problems. The authorities have further signed a concessional loan for a road project linking
Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, which would substantially reduce traveling distance and help
promote regional economic integration.
8.
These concessional loans amount to USD 1 billion and bring the debt-to-GDP ratio to
a projected 56 percent by end-2009. The authorities believe that the projects that are financed
with these loans will improve Tajikistan’s growth potential and debt capacity. As pointed out
in the staff report, the World Bank agrees that these projects have the potential to contribute
to Tajikistan’s long-term growth prospects. Moreover, in recognition of significant advances
in macroeconomic management and governance, the World Bank has recently reclassified
Tajikistan as a “medium-performer,” which also implies a higher debt capacity.
9.
However, the authorities understand that their borrowing strategy raises concerns
about debt sustainability, particularly the pace of debt accumulation. To address these

3
concerns, they intend to adopt a well-defined debt management strategy, the key pillars of
which would be (1) a zero ceiling on contracting non-concessional debt, and (2) a
medium-term foreign debt ceiling of 60 percent of GDP. The joint Fund-Bank external debt
sustainability analysis shows that under the baseline scenario, Tajikistan’s debt would remain
sustainable and debt service payments manageable. Under the historical scenario, all debt
burden ratios not only remain well below the threshold indicators but also follow a
downward trend throughout the projection period. It should also be recalled that fiscal
prudence and adherence to fiscal targets have been a strength under previous Fund programs,
which helped the authorities to reduce the external debt-to-GDP ratio from about 130 percent
at the end of the 1990s to about 50 percent in 2005 before receiving MDRI relief.
Which Reforms Could a New Fund Arrangement Support?
10.
In addition to the debt management strategy outlined above, the authorities intend to
make further improvements in tax and customs administration, and they are aware of the
need to address the high level of tax arrears. They are also committed to improve public
expenditure policy and management, including the financial monitoring of state enterprises.
A new Fund arrangement could help to gather internal support for such measures, including
for the above mentioned borrowing ceilings.
11.
The authorities aim to strengthen monetary policy management and develop the
banking sector. A new Fund arrangement could help the authorities to design the appropriate
policy framework and the results of the forthcoming FSAP could be incorporated.
12.
The authorities will work closely with the World Bank on energy sector reform,
including a plan to improve energy sector finances. On February 1, the authorities increased
electricity tariffs by 25 percent. The authorities intend to make further progress toward
cost-recovery, accompanied by improvements in the social assistance mechanism. With the
assistance of the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, they also intend to continue
with reforms of the agricultural, civil service, and education sectors.
