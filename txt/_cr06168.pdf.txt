The mission met with the President, Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Minister,
the Ministers of Public Finance, Economy, Labor, and Transportation, the
Governor of the National Bank of Romania (NBR), other senior officials, and
members of parliament, including opposition parties. It also met with the EC,
EBRD, IBRD, academics, bankers, labor unions, employers’ associations, and
the foreign investors council. Mr. Croitoru (OED) participated in policy
discussions.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background. Real GDP growth slowed to 4.1 percent in 2005, with agricultural output falling as
a result of floods and industrial output growth slowing due in part to the abolition of global
textile quotas. Domestic demand grew strongly, however, reflecting a sharp increase in private
consumption, which in turn was supported by a direct tax cut, higher wages, and rapid credit
growth. Consequently, the disinflation process has slowed (CPI inflation was 8.6 percent y-o-y in
December 2005 and 8.5 percent y-o-y in February 2006), and the current account deficit widened
to 8.7 percent of GDP in 2005.
Outlook. Growth is expected to pick up to 5.2 percent in 2006, driven by a recovery in
agriculture and industry. Domestic demand growth will slow due to fiscal consolidation, more
moderate wage growth, and monetary tightening. Staff’s scenario projects inflation of 6.5 percent
at end-2006 and a current account deficit of 8.5 percent of GDP. The authorities broadly agreed
with the scenario, but thought that growth could be higher.
Policy Issues and Discussions
Fiscal policy should be the centerpiece for the macroeconomic strategy, especially given the
likelihood of continued large capital inflows. Further fiscal consolidation should aim at
stemming excess demand and keeping public finances on a sustainable medium-term path. Staff
advocated a balanced budget in 2006 and small surpluses over the medium term, but the
authorities considered that a milder adjustment would be sufficient and appropriate to achieve
their macro objectives. Given the tight expenditure envelope, Romania’s substantial
infrastructure requirements, and the need for additional resources for the country’s contribution
to the EU budget and co-financing of EU projects, the revenue base should be strengthened.
A prudent wage policy is critical for successful disinflation. To this end, the government’s
wage policy needs to be recalibrated to the needs of a low inflation country, featuring wage
increases only once a year. The authorities noted their recent decision to freeze non-EU-related
vacant positions, and their intent to exercise prudence in their SOE- and minimum-wage policies,
but acknowledged that vigilance will be necessary to avoid wage overruns.
In light of the 2005 inflation outturn, the authorities need to establish firmly the credibility
of their new inflation-targeting regime. Staff urged a tightening of monetary policy, through an
increase in interest rates. In early-February, the NBR increased its policy rate by 100 basis points
and has since stepped up sterilization operations, bringing the effective interest rate in line with
the policy rate. The authorities agreed with the staff’s assessment that the exchange rate remains
competitive. Staff recommended that intervention in the foreign exchange market be fully
sterilized and focused on reducing excess volatility, rather than controlling the longer-term trend.
Financial soundness indicators point to a relatively healthy and resilient banking system, and the
mission suggested further implementation of FSAP recommendations.
Sustained growth and rapid convergence to EU living standards are contingent on progress
in structural reforms. There was agreement on the need to maintain momentum on
privatization, continue energy price adjustments, make the labor market more flexible, strengthen
governance, and improve the business climate.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Discussions were held against a backdrop of widening macroeconomic
imbalances and approaching EU accession. While convergence to the EU continues and
confidence remains high, developments during the past year have raised concerns. Growth
and disinflation have slowed, and the external deficit has widened. The European
Commission’s latest report noted Romania’s progress in implementing EU legislation, but
also cautioned that accession could be delayed until January 2008 unless decisive actions are
undertaken, mainly in developing sufficient administrative and judicial capacity, and fighting
corruption. The next monitoring report will be presented in May 2006, and the accession date
may be decided in June 2006.
2.
The political events of late-2004 had significant economic implications.
Opposition leader Basescu won the presidential elections in December 2004, and his party
formed a coalition government. The new government cut the personal income and profit
taxes to a single rate of 16 percent effective January 1, 2005 and initiated a process for
increasing pensions. These policies, in tandem with significant public-sector wage increases,
exacerbated already-strong demand pressures. Political turmoil in mid-2005, in which an
initial announcement to hold early parliamentary elections was reversed, led to the
reconsideration of some critical policies.
II. BACKGROUND
3.
Romania has registered substantial accomplishments since 2000. Stop-go policies
during the 1990s left Romania behind many other transition economies with mediocre
growth, high inflation, and low FDI. Following the 1999 currency crisis, macroeconomic
conditions improved as a result of fiscal adjustment, enhanced financial performance of stateowned companies (SOEs), and privatization. The NBR achieved substantial disinflation
while slowing the rate of depreciation. This stabilization, and improved prospects for EU
accession, prompted a positive supply response.

Strong credit growth has been associated with expanding domestic demand and
inflationary pressures. Real domestic credit grew by 45 percent in 2005, and while
foreign-currency denominated credit growth has slowed more recently, leu credit
growth has picked up substantially. The shift away from foreign currencydenominated lending partly reflects a number of measures introduced to contain
foreign currency-denominated credit (Box 1), as well as a monetary easing in the fall
of 2005.

Box 1. Credit-Related Measures
•

(July 2005). The reserve requirement of 30 percent is extended to all foreign currencydenominated liabilities, regardless of their maturity or contract date.

•

(August 2005). The reserve requirement on RON-denominated liabilities, with maturities less
than 2 years, is lowered from 18 to 16 percent.

•

(August 2005). Regulations on limits to household-lending risk are tightened. The new
regulations set a monthly debt-service ceiling of 40 percent of the net monthly income of the
borrower, and cover the sum of all commitments (e.g., mortgage, real-estate and consumer
loans). Moreover, the monthly debt service ceilings for consumer and real-estate credits are
limited to 30 and 35 percent of monthly net income, respectively.

•

(September 2005). For credit institutions granting foreign exchange-denominated loans,
exposure to unhedged borrowers is limited to 300 percent of the creditor’s own funds. In this
context, only borrowers with foreign currency income are considered to be hedged.

•

(December 2005 and February 2006). The reserve requirement on foreign currencydenominated liabilities was increased from 30 percent to 35 percent, and again to 40 percent.

•

The credit expansion has also paralleled sizeable external imbalances. The
current account deficit widened to 8.7 percent of GDP in 2005 from 8.5 percent of
GDP in 2004.1 Import growth continues to outpace export growth, but rising FDI and
EU transfers covered about 90 percent of the current account, with private capital
inflows financing the rest and supporting substantial reserve accumulation. An
updated debt sustainability analysis points to a sustainable deficit of 8 percent of GDP
(Box 2 and Appendix IV).
The credit expansion has paralleled a widening of the current account deficit...

... but capital inflows have fully financed the current account and allowed for a large
reserve accumulation.

The analysis is also sensitive to exchange rate developments. A 10 percent real depreciation,
accompanied by a sudden stop of non-debt-creating flows in 2006, would raise external debt by
17 percentage points of GDP on impact, before any current account response. Returning to a debtto-GDP ratio of 35 percent by 2011, would require a current account deficit of 6¾ percent of GDP
on average over 2007-10, against a baseline of 8 percent of GDP.

Romania’s competitive advantage has narrowed. The gains achieved by the 1999
exchange-rate correction were preserved until end-2004 in an environment of low
capital inflows. However, the recent appreciation, in tandem with strong wage growth
and declining productivity gains, is eroding profitability and competitiveness (Box 3).

Enterprise profitability in the
manufacturing sector appears to have deteriorated on account of wage growth and a slowdown in
productivity, although increasing labor costs have been largely offset by strong growth in the price
of exported goods. Nonetheless, Romania has historically enjoyed a significant competitive edge;
staff analysis suggests there still exists a margin for further appreciation, at a measured pace,
without causing a significant deterioration in the external balance.

complacency and monitor future productivity developments closely, staff analysis suggests that the

not yet be viewed with undue alarm.

The introduction of the flat tax, however, led to a loss in personal income and profit tax
collections of about 1 percent of GDP (Box 4). This loss was offset by higher-than-budgeted

Box 4. Tax Policy
Effective January 1, 2005, the profit tax was cut from 25 percent to 16 percent; a single personal income
tax rate of 16 percent replaced a progressive five-bracket scale with rates of 18-40 percent; while the tax on
micro-enterprises was increased and an already-approved cut in the social contributions rate was cancelled.
Effective May/June 2005, the increase in excises envisaged for July was brought forward and excises
increased further; the tax on interest and short-term capital gains (for securities and commercial real estate)
was increased from 1 to 10 percent, the tax on gambling to 16 percent, and the profit tax, VAT, and excisetax bases were broadened.
The revenue loss from the cut in the personal income and profit tax (compared with 2004) amounts to about
1 percent of GDP. Compared with the baseline of no tax cuts, the loss is about 1½ percent of GDP. This
loss was compensated by better-than-budgeted VAT collections mainly on account of strong consumption.

In addition to the tax cut, procyclical wage and pension policies exacerbated
domestic demand pressures.
Public sector real wage growth has outpaced that of the private sector.

strongly by other macroeconomic objectives. In a major regime change, the NBR

Progress on structural reforms has been mixed. Large-scale privatization has
continued (including with the sale of Romania’s largest bank (BCR), expected to be
completed shortly), but the government is reconsidering its strategy for privatizing the last

amendments fall short of eliminating some of the main sources of labor-market rigidity.
Finally, judicial reform has progressed, including the recent establishment of a National
Anticorruption Prosecutor’s Office that will be able to investigate and prosecute members of
parliament. Little progress has been made on the liquidation of Rafo, a large oil refinery and
one of the biggest debtors to the budget.

III. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
10.
Discussions focused on policies for reducing imbalances and setting the stage for
sustainable high growth. With slowing growth and disinflation, and a widening current
account deficit, there was broad recognition that, unless decisive action is taken, the situation
could deteriorate further. Accordingly, discussions covered the following questions:
•

What is the most appropriate policy mix to reduce imbalances and best support the
authorities’ growth and inflation objectives in a new era of no capital controls?

•

Can Romania bring inflation down to low single digits without relying as much on
exchange rate appreciation and thus losing competitiveness and threatening growth?

- 17 -

•

How can fiscal policy respond to substantial expenditure needs and raise resources to
cover EU accession-related expenditures, while lowering the burden on monetary
policy to lower inflation?

•

What are the main elements of the structural reform agenda that will help Romania’s
convergence to EU living standards?

11.
The authorities have concurred with the thrust of the Fund’s overall economic
assessment and policy advice (Box 5).
Box 5. Fund Policy Recommendations and Implementation
The authorities have broadly followed the Fund’s policy advice 1/, although some recent policy
decisions have exacerbated excess demand pressures.
Fiscal policy: While fiscal consolidation has continued, last year’s tax cuts led to a significant revenue
loss and were not accompanied by sufficient broadening of the tax base. Progress on tax administration
and the articulation of a medium-term fiscal framework has been slow.
Monetary policy: Over the past two years, monetary policy has been broadly in line with Fund advice
and has been successful in bringing inflation down to single digits, albeit slower than expected.
Wage policy: Substantial wage increases in the general government sector during 2004-06 have not
been in line with the Fund’s long-standing recommendation for prudent wage policy, and have
threatened macroeconomic stability. By contrast, wage policy in the SOEs and minimum wage increases
during 2005-06 were more prudent.
Structural policies: Significant progress has been made on privatization, and energy pricing has been
broadly in line with Fund recommendations. However, domestic gas prices have fallen behind
international prices and labor market flexibility has improved only marginally. Recent efforts to increase
the independence and effectiveness of the judiciary should help improve the business climate.

A. Macroeconomic Outlook, Vulnerability, and Risks
12.
The authorities recognized that sustaining strong growth requires
macroeconomic stabilization and renewed reform. A tightening of macroeconomic
policies is needed to resume disinflation and contain external imbalances. Tighter fiscal and
incomes policies will allow monetary policy to fight inflation without excessive upward
pressure on the exchange rate. In this connection, staff supported the authorities’
commitment to further establish the credibility of the inflation-targeting regime. Moreover,
the authorities agreed with the staff’s analysis that, while the recent sharp leu appreciation
has narrowed the margin, the exchange rate remained competitive.

Box 6. Accession, Efficiency, and Long-Term Growth
As outlined by the staff’s analysis in Growth in the Central and Eastern European Countries of the
European Union—A Regional Review, (IMF Occasional Paper (to be published)), integration with
the EU will likely play a profound role in supporting growth in Romania. As with other countries,
catch-up growth will be dominated initially by increases in TFP, and recent staff research has provided a
quantitative model of how Romania’s productivity may evolve over the next decade (see IMF Country
Report No. 05/416). The model uses a stochastic-frontier framework that relates each country’s
productivity to its overall efficiency—i.e., how effectively the country employs its available resources.
The model then provides a measure of this efficiency, gauged against a hypothetical benchmark in which
all resources are used optimally using international best-practice techniques. In the context of Romania’s
accession, the model allows us to draw from the experience of other countries, focusing in particular on
that of the EU.

With convergence, we can expect
a sizeable improvement in
overall efficiency and income.
Part of this will reflect an EUsupported increase in public
investment and infrastructure. A
further—perhaps larger—part will
reflect the authorities’ success in
bringing Romania’s institutional
framework into greater harmony
with EU standards. Within this
framework, staff have outlined
three quantitative scenarios.

In the high-case scenario, it is
assumed that the authorities are
able to absorb all EU grants, and that they are able to implement in full a successful program of
institutional and structural reform. It is estimated that, over the next ten years, this would bring
Romania’s efficiency level from the current level of 50 percent to about 70 percent—the estimated
efficiency level for both Greece and Portugal in 2000 was about 75 percent. The net result is a significant
boost in TFP, and a sustainable GDP growth rate of 7½ percent. The staff’s medium-case scenario is
deliberately conservative. It allows for some slippage in the authorities’ structural reform program, and
assumes a more subdued pace of public investment—the latter resulting from project-management
bottlenecks or other binding constraints. Overall, this scenario envisages a modest improvement of
efficiency from

15.
Although vulnerability indicators point to low short-term risks, medium-term
risks would be more substantial without a shift to more stability-oriented policies and
structural reforms. External and public debt levels are low, and reserve coverage is
comfortable. However, uneven policy implementation remains a key source of risk. In the
absence of a change in the policy mix, inflationary pressures will continue, the deterioration
in external competitiveness could deepen, and the widening in the current account deficit
could continue, potentially fueling a boom-bust cycle (baseline scenario in text table).

All these factors would adversely affect the debt-service capacity of households and

B. Macroeconomic Policies
Fiscal policy
16.
The authorities and staff agreed that fiscal policy should be the centerpiece of
the authorities’ strategy, although differences of view arose regarding the size of fiscal
adjustment. Fiscal policy should aim at stemming excess demand and keeping public
finances on a sustainable medium-term path. To this end, staff urged the authorities to target
a balanced budget in 2006 and small surpluses over the medium term. With the expenditure
envelope already tight, staff suggested that the proposed fiscal adjustment be implemented
through revenue-raising measures. Staff also noted that although fiscal sustainability is not an
immediate concern, in light of the country’s low public debt (Appendix IV) a tight fiscal and
incomes policy is needed to quell excess demand pressures from continued large capital
inflows. The authorities saw merit in further fiscal consolidation this year, but considered the
0.3 percent of GDP adjustment envisaged for 2006 (from last year’s outturn of 0.8 percent of
GDP) as sufficient. They also noted that the factors that led to the excess demand pressures
last year, namely the tax cut and wage hikes, would not be repeated this year. They felt that
small deficits could be accommodated in the medium term, without endangering fiscal
sustainability and noted the need to boost infrastructure spending.

Finally, Romania faces substantial infrastructure needs. Staff suggested the following menu
of options for strengthening revenue: an increase in the VAT, revisiting the rate of the flat
tax, broadening the tax base, increasing property taxes, increasing administrative fees, and
improving revenue administration. Staff also noted the importance of stability in the fiscal
code and recommended that significant revenue-raising measures be approved in the first half
of this year, to take effect no later than January 2007. The authorities indicated their plans for
a comprehensive revision of the fiscal code later in 2006, but did not elaborate on specific
measures. They noted, though, that planned improvements in revenue administration should
strengthen revenue collections.

The authorities’ efforts to strengthen revenue administration are a step in the
right direction, but must be buttressed with legislative changes. With FAD and World
Bank assistance, the authorities have embarked on a comprehensive reform of revenue
administration. Staff urged the authorities to draw on the plan proposed by the June 2004
FAD mission to modernize tax administration and broaden the tax base. This plan aims at:
establishing full control of field offices; limiting the role of the unified revenue agency to
revenue administration; eliminating restrictions on audits and arrears enforcement; and
harmonizing tax and social requirements for income definitions and bases, eligibility
determination, and payment. Staff also noted the need to adopt a comprehensive plan to
eliminate illegal trade in petroleum products and cigarettes, and fight corruption in customs
administration. Finally, staff cautioned that although administration improvements are
always welcome, it would take time for such benefits to materialize.

The authorities recognized the importance of a strict public-sector wage policy
for successful disinflation. To anchor inflation expectations in low single digits, public
sector wages should increase only once a year. Moreover, wage levels need to reflect skill

Moreover, starting in 2007, they
committed to one wage increase per year. Finally, they noted that the increase in the
minimum wage was contained to 6.5 percent in 2006 and considered the 3.5 percent increase
in the wage bill of the SOEs that are monitored under the Stand-By Arrangement prudent.
20.
Staff noted that additional measures will be needed to achieve the fiscal
objective. The envisaged reduction in the allocation for goods and services is not sustainable
and could lead to new arrears. This consideration, combined with pressures stemming from
recent wage increases, points to an underlying deficit of over 1 percent of GDP, compared
with the approved deficit of 0.5 percent of GDP. Staff welcomed the government’s decision
to freeze all vacant positions in the general government (with the exception of EU accessionrelated hiring), which is expected to offset wage overruns. Staff also urged the authorities to
cancel bonuses and monitor wage developments closely. In the absence of further measures,
meeting the deficit target may again result in a squeeze in capital expenditure. The authorities

- 24 -

felt confident that the budgeted allocation for goods and services was sufficient, and thus
additional measures would not be needed to meet their deficit target. Staff also highlighted
the risk to the fiscal target of using the proceeds from the sale of BCR for non-budgeted
projects. Finally, staff noted that, to balance the budget and provide for a permanent increase
in revenue, strong revenue action is needed.
21.
The authorities acknowledged the fiscal-management challenges associated with
the expected sizeable privatization proceeds and EU transfers. As a first step, it is
important to assess the macroeconomic impact of privatization proceeds (projected at about
3 percent of GDP in 2006) and EU transfers (over 2 percent of GDP in 2007). Staff noted
that, while privatization inflows will help reduce public debt and support the pension reform
in the coming years, they may also risk generating pressures for higher spending, thus
resulting in higher deficits, and weakening the resolve for fiscal reform. In addition, staff
stressed the importance of developing a medium-term framework that will set a realistic
fiscal trajectory, fully incorporating revenue from privatization, post-accession EU receipts
and expenditures, and the impact of ongoing reforms. Moreover, it is important to put in
place mechanisms to ensure the efficient allocation of resources and absorption of EU
inflows. Transparency and candid communication will help avoid surprises, while
simultaneously improving budgetary controls. With EU accession approaching, structural
fiscal reforms will be important in improving the quality of public expenditure. The World
Bank has been assisting the authorities with, among other, reforms of the civil service, health,
and pension systems, with the objectives of overhauling pay and employment practices,
improving the quality of health services while containing costs, and introducing a second
pension pillar, respectively. Finally, public spending management needs to be improved to
ensure a uniform spending pattern over the year.
Monetary policy
22.
Discussions focused on the need to strengthen confidence in the NBR’s
commitment to inflation targeting. In the staff’s view, the introduction of inflation
targeting had been somewhat inauspicious—the announcement of the new regime had
coincided with strong capital inflows, prompting the NBR to intervene heavily in the foreign
exchange market and to cut interest rates, rather than allow further appreciation. While
acknowledging that the authorities faced a difficult environment, staff noted that the inflation
target had been missed just four months after its announcement and remarked that the policy
compromise had sent mixed signals to the market, complicating the NBR’s efforts to
successfully anchor inflationary expectations.

- 25 -

23.
Staff projections for inflation, broadly in line with those of the authorities, imply
that the NBR was unlikely to meet its target for 2006. Missing this year’s target would

that, on balance, there was little

inflation targets for 2006-07. While
noting that it is generally desirable to set targets that are ambitious yet feasible, staff
concurred that a large revision of the 2006 target would be more costly in terms of the NBR’s
credibility. The authorities pointed to their own simulations, which suggested that such a
revision would significantly dampen the pace of disinflation over the forecast horizon. The
mission stressed that the key to regaining credibility was to provide a frank public discussion
of the reasons for missing the 2005 target—including a discussion of policy errors. Also,
while candidly acknowledging that the 2006 target range might now be out of reach, the
discussion should focus instead on the inflation forecast for end-2007 and include a credible
action plan to achieve the 4-percent target by the end of this period. The authorities agreed on
the need for supporting fiscal and incomes policy to achieve the inflation objective.

wages, and the persistence of inflationary expectations.
26.
The authorities shared the staff’s view that, while Romania’s margin of
competitiveness has been eroded, the exchange rate remains competitive (Box 3).4
Exports were still performing well due to a welcome shift away from low value-added goods,
as well as an improvement in the quality of goods. Moreover, trend real appreciation was a
phenomenon shared by most transition countries as they converged with Western Europe,
although the recent real appreciation was sharper and faster than that experienced in other
transition economies. Staff’s analysis showed that Romania’s real exchange rate was still
undervalued, and would continue to rise with further market-friendly institutional reform and
associated capital inflows. The authorities agreed with this assessment. In this context, the
mission suggested that an appreciation resulting from monetary tightening should be
accommodated, unless it leads to a possible undershooting of the inflation target. Staff
stressed that intervention in the foreign exchange market should be sterilized fully at the
policy rate, and should be focused primarily on reducing excess volatility, rather than
attempting to control a longer-term trend. In addition, staff emphasized that NBR balance
sheet concerns should not determine the conduct of monetary policy.
27.
Following the conclusion of the mission, the NBR announced a 100 basis-point
increase in the policy rate to 8.5 percent. Sterilization operations have also been stepped
up, bringing the effective rate in line with the policy rate. And as expected, this has generated
added pressure on the local currency, which has appreciated by about 5 percent against the
euro since the beginning of the year. In the staff’s view, these movements will impact
demand and inflation in the conventional manner—although, taking into account the effect of
high euroization and low household debt on Romania’s monetary transmission mechanism,
the exchange rate channel is likely to be stronger, and the interest-rate channel weaker,
compared to other more financially-developed economies.
28.
Prudential restrictions on credit flows (Box 1) had a significant short-run impact
on the mix between foreign-currency and local-currency lending.5 From a peak of
5 percent of GDP in August 2005, the annualized flow of foreign-currency credit turned
negative by end-December, while local-currency flows have almost doubled to 7 percent of
GDP over the same period. The mission observed, however, that the shifting composition of
lending had been assisted in large part by monetary loosening over the course of 2005, which
had resulted in a narrowing gap between local– and foreign-currency interest rates.
Nonetheless, despite expanding lei credit, the pace of overall lending has decelerated—with a
drop in the total (annualized) credit flow from about 9 percent of GDP in August to just
above 5 percent of GDP in December.

The mission presented a seminar to discuss its findings on competitiveness. The staff’s

Staff cautioned, however, that the effectiveness of administrative measures
would likely diminish over time. Demand for credit remains strong, so borrowers and
lenders have a continued incentive to find alternate channels for funding. Indeed, some
foreign-owned banks have started to adjust to the new lending limits; e.g., by selling their
loan portfolios abroad, or by raising additional capital. Moreover, restrictions on bank
lending may have encouraged direct foreign borrowing by large corporate clients, and may
have also favored the less-regulated non-bank financial sector. On the latter point, the
authorities have taken steps to bring non-bank institutions (NBFI) within the scope of their
authority, and the mission welcomed efforts to speed up the implementation of supporting
legislation—pending passage of this legislation, an emergency ordinance bringing NBFIs
under NBR regulation and supervision was passed, and it is anticipated that the new NBFI
requirements will be fully effective by mid-2006.
30.
To ensure the development of a sound and efficient financial system, staff
advised the authorities to be wary of viewing prudential-style measures as a substitute
for more traditional stabilization instruments. Prudential measures should aim to ensure
that the risks associated with credit growth are adequately managed by lenders. Moreover,
staff warned that, if used in the place of interest rates to dampen demand. such measures are
often associated with undesirable or unintended consequences, and might fuel doubts
regarding the priority given to controlling inflation.
C. Financial Sector Stability and Development
31.
The mission observed that, while the banking sector seemed well-positioned to
absorb adverse shocks, the authorities needed to be alert to medium-term
vulnerabilities. Financial soundness indicators suggest a relatively healthy and robust
financial system, and discussions increased staff’s confidence in this assessment. Rates of
return on equity and capital-adequacy ratios are high, while non-performing loan (NPL)
ratios remain at moderate levels. NBR stress tests also suggested that the banking system was
resilient to the direct impact of interest rate and exchange rate movements. Still, indirect
exposures through loan portfolios are more difficult to assess, and need to be reflected in
high capital ratios and conservative provisioning. In addition, strong income and credit
growth in recent years have helped hold down NPL ratios. As growth slows to more
sustainable rates and loan portfolios mature, NPL ratios could increase significantly.
32.
Substantial progress has been made in strengthening the regulatory and
supervisory framework. Many recommendations made in the 2003 Financial Sector
Assessment Program (FSAP) have been implemented, including the introduction of
consolidated supervision; payment and settlements systems; the recent extension of
supervision to cover non-bank credit institutions; improved information exchanges with
foreign-banking supervisors; tighter regulation of lending exposures; and establishment of a
credit bureau. The mission observed that progress in developing capacity for assessing
financial-system stability had been impressive. Staff looked forward to the publication of the
first Financial Stability Report in April/May 2006.

- 28 -

33.
Implementation of FSAP recommendations should continue, including improving
accounting and audit practices in the corporate and financial sectors; strengthening investor
and creditor rights and judicial-system effectiveness; promoting increased information
sharing through the credit bureau, including through closer monitoring of banks’ efforts to
assess borrower indebtedness. The mission supported efforts to further upgrade the NBR’s
risk-assessment capacity, especially in preparation for introduction of Basel II. Staff
suggested that the authorities should also consider issuing financial instruments to establish
benchmark yields, thus promoting domestic capital-market activity.
D. Structural Policies
34.
The authorities saw structural reforms as crucial for convergence to EU living
standards. Discussions focused on a range of issues, many of which are covered by the
World Bank in the context of their PAL 2 discussions.
Privatization
35.
The authorities acknowledged the need to maintain momentum for
privatization. They noted that the recent sale of BCR was an important success for the
government and should help improve the business climate and attract FDI. Staff urged them
to continue with the privatization of CEC, the restructuring and privatization of the power
generation sector (including Romgaz), and the privatization of other smaller companies.
Energy Sector and Mining
36.
Although the authorities recognized the need to continue energy price
adjustments, they were hesitant in announcing their intentions. Staff regretted that gas
prices had not been adjusted in line with opportunity costs. They also urged the authorities to
announce publicly a schedule for increased domestic producer prices, in line with their EU
commitment to achieve import parity over the medium term. Accelerating the speed of price
convergence, while allowing adequate time for agents to adjust, would help expedite
enterprise restructuring. Staff also noted the importance of implementing the heating sector
strategy. Finally, staff commended progress in implementing the mining sector strategy and
argued for the accelerated restructuring of the hard coal sector.

The authorities are
determined to strengthen governance and improve the business climate. During various
discussions, the business community noted the difficulties of using the judicial system. The
authorities, however, felt that rapid progress is being made on forcefully implementing the
judicial reform agenda. They also noted their determination to pursue the liquidation of Rafo,
and to implement effectively the improved bankruptcy proceedings approved last year.

- 30 -

Finally, the authorities established a National Anticorruption Prosecutor’s Office that will be
able to investigate and prosecute members of parliament.
E. Program Issues
39.
Staff noted its preparedness to engage in program discussions, should the
authorities request a resumption of the SBA review discussions. In June 2005, staff had
reached understandings on the completion of the next SBA reviews, but political turmoil in July
derailed implementation of key policies agreed with staff. The authorities expressed their
interest in resuming discussions to complete reviews of the SBA prior to its expiration in July
2006, and noted that over the coming months they would engage staff on the key
conditionality for a Fund-supported program.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
40.
Romania stands at an important crossroad. Although convergence to the EU
continues and confidence in the country’s medium-term prospects remains high, the
economic outlook is clouded by widening imbalances. Economic growth and disinflation
have slowed, and external imbalances have widened. Despite continued fiscal consolidation,
domestic demand has been exacerbated by rapid credit growth and procyclical policies— i.e.,
substantial tax cuts and public-sector wage increases.
41.
A tightening of policies is needed to resume Romania’s disinflation path to
reduce external imbalances and vulnerabilities and to set the stage for sustainable
growth. Consumption smoothing is understandable, but it is important to pay due regard to
enhancing the economy’s productive capacity and to design macroeconomic policies more
prudently until real income growth is secured. Higher foreign savings will ultimately boost
investment and help the country’s integration into the EU. But care must be taken to invest
these funds wisely, and to ensure that the urge to increase current consumption does not
generate excess private or government spending that could jeopardize the authorities’
stabilization goals. Tighter fiscal and incomes policies will relieve some of the burden on
monetary policy and will minimize upward pressure on the exchange rate. While most
vulnerability indicators are satisfactory, failure to address the economy’s widening
imbalances may eventually lead to an adverse change in market sentiment.
42.
A strong fiscal stance should be the centerpiece of the authorities’ strategy,
especially given the likelihood of continued large capital inflows. To this end, and
although fiscal sustainability is not of immediate concern, the authorities should target a
balanced budget for 2006 and small surpluses thereafter. Without further measures, meeting
the government’s 2006 deficit target of 0.5 percent of GDP may again result in an
unfortunate squeeze in capital expenditure. Moreover, staff cautioned the authorities on the
utilization of privatization proceeds for higher spending, thus resulting in a larger deficit,
which would then compromise their macroeconomic objectives.

- 31 -

43.
Given the tight expenditure envelope, there is a need to strengthen revenues. It is
therefore regrettable that the introduction of the flat tax resulted in a sizeable revenue loss.
Additional resources will be required for Romania’s contribution to the EU budget and cofinancing of EU projects, and to allow for a much-needed boost in infrastructure spending.
High social contribution taxes remain an impediment to employment, and needed cuts in
labor taxation will have to be offset by other taxes. Finally, given the importance of stability
in the tax code, well-designed revenue-raising measures should be approved now and take
effect no later than January 2007. This would forgo the need of tinkering with the tax regime
thereafter. It is also important to broaden the tax base and modernize fiscal administration.
44.
The authorities should prepare an ambitious and transparent medium-term
framework—setting a realistic fiscal trajectory, and fully incorporating the impact of
ongoing reforms and post-accession flows. Such a framework would avoid surprises, while
simultaneously improving budgetary controls. In this context, public spending management
needs to be improved to ensure a uniform pattern over the entire year and thus prevent
sudden inflationary pressures. Moreover, the authorities need to assess the macroeconomic
impact of large privatization proceeds and EU funds. It is essential to put in place
mechanisms to ensure the efficient allocation of resources and a high absorption rate for EU
inflows.
45.
Prudent public sector wage policy is critical for macroeconomic stability. With
large wage increases, inflation in Romania has been considerably higher than in all other
European countries over the past 15 years. The government’s wage policy needs to be
recalibrated to the needs of a low inflation economy, featuring wage increases only once a
year. While the government’s recent decision to freeze all vacant positions in the general
government (with the exception of EU accession-related hiring) is welcome, vigilance will be
necessary to avoid wage overruns. In the staff’s view, the 2006 wage increases in the general
government are not compatible with the NBR’s announced inflation target. Nonetheless, the
authorities should be commended for their prudent decisions regarding the minimum wage
and the wage bill of public enterprises.
46.
The central bank should continue strengthening its inflation-targeting
credentials. The recent tightening of monetary policy is most welcome, but further
tightening might be necessary. The February increase in the policy interest rate by 100 basis
points is an important first step, as it not only underscores the primacy of inflation over other
considerations, but will also play a vital role in bringing inflation down to the center of the
target range by end-2007. Although the exchange rate remains competitive, Romania’s
margin of competitiveness has been eroded, so productivity gains and prudent wage policies
will be needed to offset the impact of a strong currency. The staff recommends that
interventions in the foreign exchange market be fully sterilized and focused on reducing
excess volatility in the foreign exchange market, rather than on controlling the longer-term
trend. With real appreciation likely as part of the income convergence process with the EU, it
is preferable that this is achieved via the exchange rate rather than higher inflation.

- 32 -

47.
The banking sector seems well-positioned to absorb adverse shocks, but the
authorities still need to be alert to medium-term vulnerabilities. Financial soundness
indicators suggest a relatively healthy and robust financial system, and stress tests suggest
that the banking system would be resilient to the direct impact of interest rate and exchange
rate movements. Still, indirect exposures through loan portfolios are more difficult to assess,
and need to be reflected in capital ratios and conservative provisioning.
48.
The authorities have made substantial progress in strengthening the regulatory
and supervisory framework. Most of the recommendations contained in the 2003 FSAP
have been implemented, and the NBR has made impressive progress in developing its
capacity for assessing overall stability. Staff commends the authorities for the recent step to
regulate nonbank financial institutions and encourages them to implement the remaining
FSAP recommendations.
49.
An ambitious program of structural reform is needed to accelerate convergence
to EU living standards while enhancing competitiveness. The recent progress on
privatization is welcome and the authorities are encouraged to maintain momentum with the
privatization of CEC bank, Romgaz, and other smaller companies. The labor market is more
flexible following the recent amendments to the Labor Code, but further amendments are
needed to eliminate the imposition of collective wage contracts for non-signatory parties and
to increase employers’ representation in the Economic and Social Council. The legal
framework has improved significantly, but implementation challenges remain, including the
need to reduce corruption, improve financial discipline, strengthen exit mechanisms for
bankrupt enterprises, and enforce creditor rights. To provide sufficient time for economic
agents to adjust, the authorities are encouraged to publish the schedule for raising gas prices
to import parity, and adjusting other energy prices in line with opportuniry costs; delaying
such adjustments will entail higher costs later on. Finally, it is important to continue progress
on the government’s mining strategy.
50.
It is proposed that Romania’s Article IV consultation cycle remains subject to
provisions of the decision on consultation cycles approved by the Board on July 15, 2002
(No. 12794-(02/76)).

1/ For program purposes, all values are defined on a monthly average basis.
2/ Program definition excludes deposits of commercial banks to meet required reserves against foreign currency deposits. This, and the fact that the figures are monthly averages, explains
the differences from the monetary survey.
3/ All changes are 12-month rates of change, unless indicated otherwise.
4/ Adjusted for changes in minimum reserve requirements.
5/ The minimum reserve requirement for lei deposits was decreased from 25 percent to 22 percent in April 2002, to 18 percent in December 2002, and to 16 percent in September 2005.

APPENDIX I

Exchange Rate Arrangements

Romania has maintained a de jure inflation-targeting regime since August 2005, but has also
characterized its exchange-rate approach as a managed float. In this context, the authorities
have intervened, often heavily, in response to perceived excessive exchange rate movements,
but have no formal predetermined path. The official reference rate published by the NBR is
an average of rates reported for interbank and client transactions. Romania has accepted the
obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, with effect from March 25, 1998. Romania’s
exchange system is free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current
international transactions.
VIII. Article IV Consultation
Romania is on the 24-month consultation cycle subject to the provisions of the decision on
consultation cycles approved by the Board on July 15, 2002. The last consultation was
concluded on July 7, 2004.
IX.

Technical Assistance

The transition in Romania has been supported by substantial technical assistance from
multilateral agencies and bilateral donors. The Fund has provided support in a number of
areas with more than 40 technical assistance missions since 1990, although the authorities
have had a mixed record with regard to implementation. Expert Fund assistance has focused
on a number of key areas, including: fiscal reforms; modernization of the central bank and
the banking system; creating a market-oriented legal structure; training; and improving the
collection and reporting of statistics. The implementation of a comprehensive tax
administration reform designed in line with the recommendations of several technical
assistance missions of the Fund’s Fiscal Affairs Department started in January 2003. A report
on the observance of standards and codes (ROSC) on fiscal transparency was completed on
November 6, 2002 (IMF Country Report No. 02/254). Furthermore, in 2003 an FSAP was
completed, while technical assistance by the Fund’s Monetary and Financial Systems
Department on inflation targeting is ongoing.
X.

Safeguards Assessment

Under the Fund's safeguards assessment policy, the NBR is subject to an assessment with
respect to the precautionary Stand-By Arrangement approved on July 7, 2004. The
assessment was completed on June 17, 2004 and concluded that the safeguards in place at the
NBR appear generally adequate. However, certain weaknesses were identified in the internal
audit and control system, and the safeguards assessment recommended measures to address
them. Recent information received from the authorities indicates that these measures have
been implemented as envisaged.

APPENDIX I

Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism framework

The legislative framework for anti-money laundering and combating the financing of
terrorism (AML/CFT) has been updated recently to bring Romania in line with international
standards, in the context of Romania's EU accession. The AML/CFT system continues,
however, to suffer from severe shortcomings, including in the supervisory area. While the
level of AML supervision is improving in the banking sector and the NBR appears to be
taking this issue seriously, it remains extremely weak for the financial sector at large. In
addition, there is very little, if any, oversight of the non-financial sector for AML/CFT
purposes and the authorities have started only recently to inspect casinos, a sector which
appears to be particularly vulnerable to money laundering risks. Finally, while AML
requirements have been extended to cover financing of terrorism recently, additional training
of reporting entities and competent authorities in this area remains necessary.
XII.

Resident Representative

The Fund has had a resident representative in Bucharest since 1991. Mr. Graeme Justice
assumed the post in January 2003.

APPENDIX II

ROMANIA: RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK
Partnership in Romania’s Development Strategy
1.
The Romanian authorities are pursuing a strategy designed to achieve macroeconomic
stability and establish sustainable economic growth and poverty reduction, moving towards
the eventual goal of accession to the European Union. Key elements of this policy include
tightening payments discipline throughout the economy, especially in the energy sector,
hardening budget constraints for state-owned enterprises, actively pursuing enterprise and
banking privatization and restructuring, and strengthening the social safety net. Over the
medium term, continuation of the current economic recovery will depend critically on the
maintenance of reform momentum and moving steadily ahead with governance and private
sector development reforms. Such reforms would stress transparency and accountability in
government, judicial reforms, improvements in the business environment, and actions to
strengthen the regulation and oversight of financial and capital markets.
2.
In broad terms, the IMF has taken the lead in assisting Romania in achieving
macroeconomic stability. As such its program focus is on the fiscal framework, monetary
policy and those elements of the structural reform program that have a direct bearing on the
macroeconomic situation. The main vehicles for its dialogue with the authorities are the
previous Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) covering the period October 31, 2001 to October 15,
2003 and the current precautionary SBA.
3.
The World Bank has taken the lead in policy dialogue on structural issues, including
poverty reduction measures, private sector development, institution building and governance.
It has a range of instruments through which it conducts dialogue, including adjustment
lending operations such as PSAL 1 and PSAL 2, a series of Programmatic Adjustment Loans,
the first of which went to the Bank Board in September 2004, several sector investment
operations and economic work such as the Public Expenditure and Institutions Review
(PEIR), and the Country Economic Memorandum (CEM).
4.
In some areas where the Bank takes the lead in the dialogue, its analysis is shared
with the IMF and is used as input for the fiscal framework, but there are no directly
corresponding structural benchmarks or policy conditions in the IMF SBA. In other areas
where the Bank takes the lead, the SBA does reflect certain elements in its conditionality.
These are generally structural reform measures which have important fiscal implications,
such as energy sector reform and restructuring. There are further areas of formal joint
responsibility such as the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP).
5.
Overall the IMF and World Bank staff maintain a close collaborative relationship in
supporting the Government’s reform program and are coordinating their policy advice to the
Romanian authorities.

- 48 -

APPENDIX II

A. IMF-World Bank Collaboration in Specific Areas
Areas in which the World Bank leads and there is no direct IMF involvement
6.
The policy areas in which the Bank leads and which are not directly incorporated into
the IMF program or country dialogue include strengthening the social safety net, revitalizing
the economy in rural areas, institution building and governance, and improving the business
environment. Bank policy dialogue for strengthening the social safety net includes poverty
monitoring, social assistance, pension reform, child welfare reform, health sector reforms,
and labor retraining and redeployment. These have been supported by the Bank’s
Employment and Social Protection Loan, the Social Sector Development Loan, the Social
Development Fund and the Mine Closure Loan. They are further supported by economic
work such as the recently completed Poverty Profile and the Local Services Delivery Study,
and by planned economic studies on poverty and vulnerability, pension reform and gender
assessment.
7.
The Bank has a range of programs to revitalize the economy in rural areas. These
include the Rural Finance Loan which supports income generation activities and will be
complemented by a Rural/Urban Linkage Growth Study to set the stage for a Rural
Development Loan supporting infrastructure development and improved governance at the
community level. The Irrigation Rehabilitation loan supports infrastructure rehabilitation and
institutional reform. Other supporting economic work includes the Community Networks
Study and the Jiu Valley Development Study.
8.
The Bank has a strong institution building and governance program. This builds on
recent reforms in local public finance and taxation and decentralization. Policy dialogue has
been facilitated the Public Expenditure and Institutions Review (PEIR) which included
analysis and recommendations relating to 1) improved resource allocation in the health
sector; 2) delivery of social assistance at the local level; 3) pension reform; 4) institutions for
budget management 5) fiscal decentralization; and 6) reforms to the budget process in the
judiciary. The policy dialogue has also been supported by a Country Financial Accountability
Assessment (CFAA). The Bank completed a Diagnostic Survey of Corruption in Romania
prior to the Government’s preparing of its National Program for Prevention of Corruption.
The first in a series of Programmatic Adjustment Loans (PAL) was approved by the World
Bank Board in September, 2004. These focus on institutional and governance reforms in the
public service and the judiciary as well as public expenditure management as well as the
remaining structural reform agenda. They are supported by a $18.6 million Private and
Public Sector Institution Building Loan (PPIBL) which provides technical assistance for
these activities and others relating to privatization. Other institution-building support
includes financing of a cadastral and land titling project, a project on the environmental
aspects of mine closures, a hazards mitigation project cofinanced by a GEF grant which
focuses on damage from earthquakes, floods toxic wastes and other hazards in high risk
areas, and by a regional project on Trade and Transportation Facilitation in South East
Europe.

- 49 -

APPENDIX II

9.
Policy advice and support for reforms in the business environment have been offered
by the Bank in several areas. Through PSAL 1 and PSAL 2 the Bank has focused on
reducing barriers to entry for firms and joint ventures, implementing internationally
recognized accounting standards and introducing improved bankruptcy and liquidation
procedures. The PALs will also address business environment issues, and all these initiatives
will be supported by technical assistance provided under the PPIBL.
Areas in which the World Bank leads and its analysis serves as input into the IMF
program
10.
The Bank supports the GOR’s privatization program through PAL program which
includes targets and timelines for privatization of commercial SOEs and financial
institutions. The program builds on the progress established under PSALs 1 and 2 which
identified pools of SOEs from which set minimum numbers of enterprises are selected for
case-by-case privatization and workout. Specific enterprises including Alro, Alprom, and
Petrom, were also identified. The PAL program continues this process with further targets for
privatization of commercial enterprises and enterprises in the energy and banking sectors.
Key to the success of this program is agreement with the Bank on strategies for the
privatization of theses entities and the subsequent adoption of a clear, open and transparent
tender process using the services of qualified investment advisors in a manner consistent with
Bank policies.
11.
The Bank has led the dialogue on restructuring, reform and eventual privatization of
enterprises in the electricity, district heating and gas industries and on the adoption of
regulatory legislation in preparation for privatization to strategic investors. As part of this
process the Bank is supporting, inter alia, energy tariff reforms and reforms in the electricity,
district heat and gas sectors. These objectives are woven into the policy conditions of the
PAL program, along with conditions related to the privatization of electricity distribution
enterprises. These conditions have been closely coordinated with the IMF since the SBAs
have also included provisions for structural reforms in the energy sector including tariff
setting, arrears clearance and collection rates. The Bank is leading the IFI dialogue with the
Government on such critical long-term issues as power generation sector restructuring and
the integration of the Romanian power sector with the South East European Regional
Electricity Market and with the EU’s electricity market, and provides assistance on the
associated regulatory and market operation issues. The Bank has also provided technical
assistance to the Ministry of Industry to establish a system of pricing and taxation of gas
consistent with attracting further investment into the industry. Policy dialogue in these and
other areas, notably including the district heating sector, will be further facilitated by ongoing
dialogue with the Government on the recently completed Energy and Infrastructure Strategy
paper and its operational recommendations.
12.
The Bank has taken the lead in dialogue and policy advice regarding regulation,
restructuring, privatization and liquidation of banks. Under PSAL 1 the Law on Bank
Privatization was modified and transparent privatization procedures established. Liquidity
and solvency requirements of the NBR were tightened and provisions introduced for

- 50 -

APPENDIX II

improved compliance with prudential regulations and external audits conducted according to
International Accounting Standards. Legal and institutional reforms were introduced for
orderly disposition of non-performing assets. These policy changes underpinned liquidation
of the most troubled bank (Bancorex ) while Bank Agricola was restructured and eventually
privatized as were two smaller state owned banks. This policy agenda is continued under the
PAL program with steps privatize the Savings Bank (CEC). The Bank is continuing the
dialogue with the government on the need to move forward with further improvements of the
legal and regulatory framework for the securities and insurance sectors. The PPIBL will
provide funding for these activities.
Areas of shared responsibility
13.
While the Bank has taken the lead in privatization and in structural reforms in the
energy sector as described above, the IMF has a strong interest from a macroeconomic
perspective since privatization revenues have been primarily used to retire public debt, and
quasi-fiscal deficits of the SOEs present a threat to macroeconomic stability. Accordingly,
there is high degree of consultation and coordination between the two institutions on these
matters. While the terms of the respective programs are mutually consistent and supportive,
the focus and motivation for the Bank’s program are on the efficiency of the resulting market
structures, improved enterprise operation, service delivery and financial performance, and the
transparency of the process and improvement in overall sector governance, and that of the
IMF is on immediate revenue generation and expenditure control, and containment of
ongoing fiscal burdens.
14.
The Bank and the IMF jointly conducted a Financial Sector Assessment Program
which was completed in June 2003.
Areas in which the IMF leads and its analysis serves as input into the World Bank
program
15.
While the Bank has focused on improvements in revenue administration, the Fund
leads the dialogue on fiscal matters. The IMF also leads the dialogue on policies to contain
certain expenditures in the public sector. These include policies regarding wage-setting in
both the public service and SOEs and the budgets of SOEs.
16.
In these areas the Bank takes into account the policy recommendations of the IMF
and ensures that its own policy advice is consistent.
Areas in which the IMF leads and there is no direct World Bank involvement
17.
The IMF is fully responsible for the dialogue on monetary policy, interest rates, the
exchange rate regime, the balance of payments and all the related statistical and measurement
issues.

- 51 -

APPENDIX II

B. World Bank Group Strategy and Lending Operations
18.
The last Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Romania was presented to the World
Bank’s Board on June 19, 2001. The CAS defined the Bank's lending and advisory services
based on the Government’s priorities of poverty reduction and EU accession, and built on the
work initiated under the Comprehensive Development Framework, for which Romania was
one of the pilot countries. About one half of the FY02–04 lending program was adjustment
lending. Two distinct lending scenarios were outlined. In the event of a hesitant pace of
reforms, Romania would have been in the low case of the CAS, with significant reductions in
Bank Group support to a level of $60 million during FY02–04 to support actions centered on
a few poverty focused interventions. However, Romania successfully remained in the highcase lending scenario under which Bank commitments of up to $995 million during FY02–04
were envisaged, compared with $600 million in FY98–00. This reflected the sustained
fulfillment of the high-case triggers, which included progress in establishing a
macroeconomic environment conducive to lower inflation and sustainable growth as well as
progress on structural issues including privatization as initiated under the PSAL program,
initiation of the privatization and work-out process for a number of remaining large stateowned enterprises, agreement on a plan and schedule for reducing energy arrears, agreement
on a method and timetable for privatization of Romanian Commercial Bank and the Savings
Bank, improvements in the financial sector legal and supervisory framework, an agreement
on an anti-corruption strategy, and approval of social assistance legislation.
19.
The high-case scenario embodied a program of accelerated structural and sectoral
reforms that will pave the way for Romania’s eventual accession to the EU. The first stage of
this program was launched with the approval of PSAL 2 by the Bank Board in September
2002 and the delivery of the Public Expenditure and Institutions Review (PEIR) in July 2002.
In the second stage to follow PSAL 2, the Bank offered support through a series of
Programmatic Adjustment Loans (PALs) focusing on institutional and governance reforms,
completion of the privatization agenda, implementation of the recommendations of the
Energy and Infrastructure Strategy Paper and improvements to the business environment, as
well as a Country Financial and Accountability Assessment and a Country Economic
Memorandum focusing on the reform agenda for Romania’s accession to the EU. The first
of these PALs was approved by the Board September 2004 and closed successfully March
31, 2005.
20.
The PAL 1 Program Document included a CAS Update covering FY05. The FY05
program, designed to support EU accession through sustaining and accelerating the reform
process, continued with two distinct lending scenarios. Remaining in the high case depended
on: (i) maintenance of a macroeconomic framework agreeable to the Bank; (ii) sustained
progress in PAL 1 actions; (iii) adherence to the agreed schedules of electricity and gas price
increases; (iv) sustained progress, satisfactory to the Bank on the sale of Petrom and two
electricity distribution companies as well as privatization of AVAS companies, including
reasonable progress in the sale of the remaining electricity companies; (v) observance of
agreed pension deficit ceiling; and (vi) timely initiation and completion of planned technical
assistance activities under the PPIPL supporting judicial and public administration reforms.

- 52 -

APPENDIX II

The next full CAS is to be discussed at the Board in the spring of 2006, after Bank
management has completed its assessment of Romania’s macroeconomic framework.
21.
The World Bank has been active in Romania since 1991 and has built up a portfolio
of 51 Bank-financed operations with total commitments of US$4.9 billion. Romania's
portfolio is the largest in ECA in terms of number of projects and third largest in
commitments. The active portfolio as of January 3, 2006 consists of 23 projects with
aggregate net commitments totaling $1.6 billion and a total undisbursed balance of $1 billion.
Sector composition in terms of net commitments is dominated by environment and socially
sustainable development (48 percent, eleven projects), and energy and infrastructure (22
percent, five projects), followed by the social sectors (17 percent, four projects).
22.
The quality of the Bank’s Romania portfolio has been improving over the past several
years. While the overall performance indicators are positive, several cross-cutting
implementation issues persist. These include: (i) project management capacity (specifically,
issues relating to procedures, inter-agency coordination, and project implementation unit
staffing and facilities), (ii) the imposition of ceilings to withdrawals from external borrowing,
in order to restrain public expenditures and protect the budget deficit target and the timely
availability of counterpart contributions as well as the quality and processing of disbursement
applications, to yield maximum development impact from the Bank’s portfolio, and (iii)
integration of procurement planning into the financial budgeting process.
23.
IFC has dedicated substantial resources to assist the development of capital markets
and infrastructure (utilities and telecommunication), and provide support for small and
medium enterprises (SMEs). To date, IFC has committed over US$712 million of its own
funds in 37 projects and has arranged over $241 million in syndications to support projects in
the financial markets, information technology, food and beverage, general manufacturing and
infrastructure. As of December 2005, IFC portfolio in Romania stood at $525 million. In
addition to investments, IFC has undertaken a number of advisory assignments aimed at
supporting the privatization and restructuring of large state-owned enterprises, public utilities
and the health sector.

APPENDIX III

ROMANIA: STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
Data collection and reporting are adequate for surveillance and program monitoring,
but the quality of the national accounts, price, fiscal, and balance-of-payments data needs
improvement. The authorities have made progress in improving economic and financial
statistics with technical assistance, including from the Fund, over the past several years.
Romania began participating in the GDDS in February 2001 and graduated to subscription to
the SDDS in May 2005.
Real Sector
2.
Quarterly and annual national accounts statistics are produced by the National
Institute for Statistics (INS) using the European System of Accounts 1995 (ESA95). Estimates
are methodologically sound and are reported to the Fund on a timely basis for publication in
the International Financial Statistics (IFS). However, quarterly and annual national accounts
are not harmonized on a regular basis and late revisions can sometimes be significant. The
latest dedicated national accounts publication was released in October 2005 and included the
final accounts for the 1999-2002 series. Provisional and semi-final versions are disseminated
in the Statistical Yearbook and other publications, and on the web at (www.insse.ro).
3.
The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is subject to standard annual re-weighting, and it is
considered reliable. In January 2004, the INS changed the coverage of the PPI to include the
domestic and non-domestic markets.
Public Finance
4.
Consolidated data on central government operations are reported annually for the
GFS Yearbook and quarterly for IFS, while EUR receives monthly budget data. Consolidated
general government data have been reported for inclusion in the 2005 GFS Yearbook. These
data are reported on an accrual basis, having been derived from cash data using various
methods: tax revenues are adjusted using the time-adjusted cash method; expense data are
adjusted using due-for-payments data; and interest payments are calculated on an accrual
basis. Beginning in 2002, the Special Fund for Development of the Energy System, Special
Fund for Public Roads, Special Fund “Romanian Agriculture Development,” and Special
Fund “Romania” were included in the state budget, while the Special Fund for Insured
Protection was eliminated from general government accounts. The reported data excluded
data on the Agency for Recovery Bank Assets.1 The authorities introduced a new budget
classification for the 2006 budget and have produced the 2004-05 outturns on the basis of the
new classification. However, they have not produced fiscal accounts for years prior to 2004.

APPENDIX III

Monetary and Financial
5.
The NBR reports monetary and financial statistics on a regular and timely basis for
publication in the IFS. Since December 2004, the NBR reports monetary data to STA using
the Standardized Report Forms, which are designed in accordance with the methodology in
the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual. Nevertheless, monetary statistics need to be
reconciled with government finance statistics. In line with 1993 SNA and MFSM, accrued
interest on deposits and loans, and securities other than shares should be incorporated in the
outstanding amount of financial assets or liquidity.
Balance of Payments
6.
The NBR routinely reports balance of payments statistics to the Fund in a timely
fashion. A 2003 STA mission undertook a detailed review of the NBR’s compilation
methodology for balance of payments and international investment position statistics,
developed in consultation with Eurostat, and concluded that the proposed system is broadly
appropriate. The STA mission supported implementation of this compilation system in 2004,
along with a new FDI survey.

APPENDIX IV

ROMANIA—EXTERNAL AND PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
A. External Sustainability
1.
With appropriate policies in place, Romania’s external sustainability will remain
under control over the medium-term. Under the baseline scenario, the external debt-toGDP ratio is expected to increase slightly to about 35 percent over the medium-term, mainly
on account of a slowdown of non-debt creating flows from the current level of 7-8 percent of
GDP to about 4¼ percent of GDP by 2010-11. Romania’s gross external financing needs are
projected to remain stable at 14½ percent of GDP throughout the projection period, reflecting
a slight increase in debt service that offsets the current account improvement.
2.
Among the standard stress tests (B1-B4), Romania’s external debt appears most
vulnerable to a further widening of the current account deficit (B3). An average
1 percent of GDP widening of the current account deficit would result in a debt-to-GDP ratio
of 40 percent over the medium-term. Policies to contain domestic demand (through lower
consumption and import growth) remain key to maintain Romania’s external sustainability.
Under other standard shocks, external debt dynamics would remain under control—a ratio of
below 40 percent of GDP—although increasing over the medium term. A sharp real
depreciation, however, could increase the debt-to-GDP ratio above 46 percent on impact,
although the ratio would return to a 35-40 percent range by the end of the projection period.
B. Fiscal Sustainability
3.
Public sector debt is expected to remain under control over the medium-term.
With appropriate policies in place, primary surpluses would remain stable at about 1 percent
of GDP and overall fiscal balances would hinge at around ¼ percent of GDP over the
medium-term. This path of fiscal accounts would lead to a fall in the public sector debt from
the current level of 19 percent of GDP to about 14 percent of GDP by 2010-11. A primary
deficit of ¾ percent of GDP would stabilize public debt at this level.
4.
However, stress tests on public debt dynamics suggest that fiscal sustainability
remains vulnerable to real GDP growth shocks. Should GDP growth slow down by about
2¼ percentage points to 3½ percent over the medium-term, public debt would climb to about
30 percent of GDP. Dynamics of public debt ratio are resilient to shocks to nominal interest
rate, real exchange rate and primary balance, with the debt ratio remaining below 25 percent
of GDP throughout the period.

Average Deviation

1/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; ρ = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms,
g = real GDP growth rate, e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock. ρ increases with an appreciating domestic currency ( ε > 0)
and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
4/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
5/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain
at their levels of the last projection year.

B1. Nominal interest rate is at baseline plus one standard deviation
B2. Real GDP growth is at baseline minus one-half standard deviations
B3. Non-interest current account is at baseline minus one-half standard deviations
B4. One time 30 percent real depreciation in 2006

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
April 26, 2006
1.
This statement provides information on recent developments since the issuance of the
staff report. The new information does not change the thrust of the staff appraisal and
reinforces the staff’s concerns about the current policy mix which places a heavy burden on
monetary policy to achieve the authorities’ macroeconomic objectives.
2.
As indicated in the statement by Messrs. Kremers and Croitoru, the authorities
confirmed during discussions with staff on the occasion of the Spring Meetings their
intention not to resume discussions for the completion of reviews under the SBA prior to its
expiration in July 2006.
3.
On account of mounting expenditure pressures, on April 19 the government
approved a revised 2006 budget, increasing the deficit from 0.5 to 0.9 percent of GDP. It
is the staff’s understanding that the approved budget includes additional allocations
equivalent to 1 percent of GDP for infrastructure, teachers’ wages, social benefits, flood
repairs, and other expenditure. This additional expenditure will be partially financed by
higher-than-originally-budgeted revenue (estimated by the authorities at 0.6 percent of GDP)
associated mainly with strong indirect tax collections due to the continued consumption
boom, but also initially-conservative revenue projections. The government also approved
(already-budgeted) hikes in excises effective July 1, 2006 in line with Romania’s
commitments to the EU; and additional excises on tobacco and alcohol, effective
immediately. The increase in the budget deficit confirms the staff’s view (¶20 of the staff
report) that the underlying budget deficit for 2006 is about 1 percent of GDP.
4.
The Senate recently approved legislation (opposed by the government) that
could increase the general government deficit relative to that in the revised budget. In
early April, the Senate approved a cut in the VAT rate on food to 9 percent (from the current
19 percent), with an estimated revenue loss of 3⁄4 percent of GDP. If approved by the House,
this will lead to a weakening of government revenue and a higher budget deficit. The
government has indicated that it will not support such legislation and the authorities have
informed staff that, in the event that it passes, offsetting revenue-raising measures will be
adopted.
5.
The envisaged fiscal loosening will accentuate external imbalances. Recent data
releases confirm that macroeconomic imbalances are widening: the consumption boom
continues, and strong import growth outpaces export growth, thus pointing to a widening
current account deficit. The narrowing of the current account deficit projected in the staff
report (incorporating a change in the policy mix as recommended by Fund staff) was driven
by an improvement in the savings-investment balance of the government, thus allowing for a
substantial increase in private sector investment. Staff now projects a widening in the current
account deficit to about 9 percent of GDP in part on account of the envisaged fiscal
loosening. This policy will increase the burden on monetary policy.

-2-

6.
The monetary authorities have affirmed their readiness to tighten policy further
depending on the evolution of inflationary pressures. Following the increase in the policy
interest rate in February, the authorities have stepped up open-market operations and have
brought the effective sterilization rate in line with the policy rate—this stance has been
maintained through April. The envisaged fiscal loosening and the inflationary consequences
of higher excise rates on tobacco and alcohol have however created a more challenging
environment for the National Bank.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2006 Article IV Consultation
with Romania
On April 26, 2006, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Romania.1
Background
Romania has registered substantial accomplishments since 2000. Macroeconomic
conditions improved owing to fiscal adjustment, the enhanced financial performance of
state-owned enterprises, and privatization. The National Bank of Romania (NBR) achieved
substantial disinflation while slowing the rate of depreciation of the exchange rate. This
stabilization, and improved prospects for EU accession, have created a positive supply
response.
Macroeconomic results were not as strong in 2005 compared with 2004 on account of both
internal and external factors. Growth slowed to 4.1 percent in 2005, with agricultural output
falling as a result of floods and industrial output growth slowing due in part to the abolition of
global textile quotas. Domestic demand, on the other hand, grew strongly reflecting a sharp
increase in private consumption—supported by significantly lower direct taxes, higher
wages, and faster credit growth. The credit expansion has contributed to a widening in the
current account deficit to 8.7 percent of GDP in 2005, and also led to inflationary pressures.
As a result, and despite the significant appreciation of the leu, disinflation slowed
considerably: CPI inflation was 8.4 percent year-on-year in March 2006.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and
discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the
staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of
the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive
Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities.

-2Fiscal consolidation continued last year: the general government deficit declined to
0.8 percent of GDP in 2005 from 1 percent of GDP in 2004. However, some procyclical
fiscal policies exacerbated domestic demand. The introduction of the 16–percent flat tax
on personal income and profits led to a loss in collections of about 1 percent of GDP.
This loss was offset by higher-than-budgeted indirect tax collections due to strong
demand for goods and services, thus keeping the revenue-to-GDP ratio broadly
constant. On the expenditure side, there were large overruns in the wage bill as a result
of substantial increases in public sector wages (16–34 percent compared with the 2004
average), and significant cuts in capital expenditure (compared to the budget).
Moreover, the recalculation of pensions for those retired before 2001 also increased
government spending. Finally, there was a significant relaxation of fiscal policy in
December 2005, as the government cleared arrears, paid for flood-related repairs and
other goods and services, and injected capital into Exim Bank.
Having brought inflation down into single digits, the NBR succeeded in maintaining
inflation on its downward trend in 2005 even though it slightly missed its inflation target
for 2005. In a major regime change, the NBR announced its shift to inflation targeting in
August 2005. However, facing sustained upward pressure on the exchange rate,
it reduced its sterilization efforts in September 2005—by not absorbing the full amount of
excess liquidity in the banking system, and so driving its effective interest rate
(the average rate at which it accepts bank deposits) significantly below its policy rate.
The drop in the effective rate was largely successful in arresting short-term pressure on
the exchange rate, but represented a significant procyclical easing of policy.
Since November 2005, the NBR has not intervened in the foreign exchange market,
and has taken steps to gradually increase the volume of sterilization. In February 2006,
the NBR redoubled its disinflation efforts by increasing its policy rate from 7.5 to 8.5
percent, and by stepping up sterilization operations to bring the effective rate in line with
the policy rate. This has generated renewed pressure on the currency, which
appreciated by about 4¼ percent against the euro from end-2005 to end-March 2006.
Mixed progress has been made on structural reforms. Large-scale privatization has
been successful (including Romania’s largest bank (BCR)), the liberalization of the
electricity and gas markets has continued, the national reference price for heating has
increased, and significant progress has been made in the implementation of the mining
strategy. However, gas prices have not been adjusted in line with opportunity costs,
and the domestic producer price is only 38 percent of the international import price.
The Labor Code has been revised with the objective of increasing labor market
flexibility, although a number of important rigidities remain. Finally, judicial reform has
progressed, including the recent establishment of the National Anticorruption
Prosecutor’s Office.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the Romanian authorities on their economic policy
achievements since 2000, including continued fiscal consolidation, disinflation,
enhanced financial performance of state-owned enterprises, and privatization.
These accomplishments, which resulted in a substantial improvement in macroeconomic
conditions, pave the way for eventual accession into the EU.

-3–

Directors stressed that Romania faces important issues. Although convergence towards
the EU continues and confidence in the country’s medium-term prospects remains high,
slowing disinflation and a widening current account deficit pose challenges.
Directors urged the authorities to adopt policies to address these developments, and to
ensure an environment that supports the growth-enhancing use of large capital inflows.
While external and public debt levels are low, and reserve coverage is comfortable,
reducing the external imbalance will be crucial for removing Romania’s external
vulnerability.
Directors, while acknowledging that fiscal sustainability is not of immediate import,
expressed concern about the government’s recent decision to increase the 2006 deficit
target. They emphasized that fiscal consolidation will be essential to containing
domestic demand, making room for capital inflows, and ensuring sustainability over the
medium term. Directors also noted that Romania needs a coherent plan for absorbing
prospective large inflows to the public accounts from EU funds and for saving
privatization proceeds, so as not to generate excess demand pressures. They looked
forward to the finalization of a medium-term budgetary framework, and urged the
authorities to put in place mechanisms to ensure the efficient allocation of resources and
a high absorption rate for EU inflows.
Directors observed that Romania’s government revenue ratio is considerably below
levels in the EU. In light of this, they regretted the sizeable revenue loss resulting from
the introduction of the flat tax. Directors also noted the need for additional resources to
cover Romania’s contribution to the EU budget, to co-finance EU projects, and to
accommodate a boost in infrastructure spending. High social contribution taxes remain
an impediment to employment, and cuts in labor taxation will have to be offset by other
taxes. In this connection, Directors urged the authorities to take revenue-raising
measures that will strengthen revenue permanently, broaden the tax base, modernize
fiscal administration, and make room for the needed higher expenditures.
Directors stressed the importance of a prudent public sector wage policy for
macroeconomic stability. They urged the authorities to recalibrate their policy to the
needs of a low inflation economy. They welcomed the authorities’ intentions in this
regard, including to restrict wage increases to only once a year. The government’s
recent decision to freeze all vacant positions in the general government (with the
exception of EU accession-related hiring) is commendable. Vigilance will be necessary
to avoid wage overruns. Directors welcomed the authorities’ prudent decisions regarding
the minimum wage and the wage bill of public enterprises.
Directors urged the authorities to continue strengthening the central bank’s inflationtargeting credentials. They noted the difficult environment in which it is operating, given
pronounced capital inflows, non-supportive wage policies, and administered price
increases. In this context, Directors welcomed the recent tightening of monetary policy,
and viewed that further tightening might be necessary, in light of the envisaged fiscal
loosening and higher excise rates. They noted that, while the exchange rate remains
competitive, Romania’s margin of competitiveness has eroded, and viewed that
productivity gains and prudent wage policies will be needed to offset the impact of a
strong currency. Moreover, interventions in the foreign exchange market should be fully

-4–

sterilized and focused on reducing excess volatility in the foreign exchange market,
rather than on controlling the longer-term trend.
Directors noted that financial soundness indicators suggest a relatively healthy and
robust financial system, and that stress tests indicate that the banking system would be
resilient to the direct impact of interest rate and exchange rate movements.
Nevertheless, with bank credit to the private sector escalating, much of it in foreign
currency and to unhedged households, Directors stressed that medium-term
vulnerabilities will need to be monitored closely. They welcomed the implementation of
recommendations contained in the 2003 FSAP and commended the authorities for the
recent step to regulate nonbank financial institutions.
Directors noted that further ambitious structural reforms are needed to accelerate
convergence to EU living standards while improving the business environment.
They welcomed the recent progress on privatization and encouraged the authorities to
maintain the momentum of the privatization of the Savings Bank, Romgaz, and other
smaller companies. Directors also welcomed recent amendments to the Labor Code
aimed at increasing labor market flexibility, but recommended further amendments to
eliminate the imposition of collective wage contracts for non-signatory parties and to
increase employers’ representation. They urged improvements in the legal framework
with a view to reduce corruption, improve financial discipline, strengthen exit
mechanisms for bankrupt enterprises, and enforce creditor rights. Directors encouraged
adjusting energy prices in line with opportunity costs.

Statement by Jeroen Kremers, Executive Director for Romania
and Lucian Croitoru, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
April 26, 2006
The broad picture
The Romanian authorities appreciate the staff report and acknowledge that the
report provides a realistic view of the policy challenges. They broadly agree with staff
recommendations. While the authorities and staff reached agreement on the need to address
imbalances, as discussed earlier this year, they have different views on the magnitude of
needed adjustments. Confident that the envisaged policy mix is adequate to preserve
macrostability and sustain strong growth, the authorities do not intend to resume discussions
for completing reviews of the SBA prior to its expiration in July 2006. The authorities thank
staff for the sound and professional advice and look forward to continued cooperation.
Macroeconomic conditions continue to be strong, although they were somewhat
altered by recent developments. After peaking at 8.4 percent in 2004, growth slowed down
to 4.1 percent in 2005 due to a decline in agriculture output induced by severe floods and a
drop in external demand, which was partly responsible for the slowing down in industrial
output. Large capital inflows continued despite the fact that the National Bank of Romania
(NBR) reduced its policy interest rate from 211⁄4 percent in June 2004 to 71⁄2 percent by end2005. These inflows increased after the capital account was liberalized in April 2005, as part
of the authorities’ EU commitments. This resulted in a significant leu appreciation. Facing
sustained upward pressure on the exchange rate, the NBR reduced its effective interest rate
for sterilization to below the headline policy interest rate soon after shifting to inflation
targeting in August 2005. This monetary relaxation, which was partly reversed later in the
year, added to the lower taxes adopted in January 2005, higher wages, and faster credit
growth, all of which led to a sharp increase in private consumption. With strong domestic
demand and higher oil and administered prices, CPI disinflation continued at a slower pace,
reaching 8.6 percent y/y in December 20051 and 8.4 percent y/y in March this year2. The
current account deficit has been roughly stable at 8.5 percent of GDP in 2004 and 8.7 percent
of GDP in 2005. In part this reflects booming consumption. It also reflects the pick-up in FDI
and Romania’s high rate of return to capital. EU grants and FDI covered 90 percent of the
current account, reflecting increased confidence in Romania’s prospects. Private capital
inflows financed the rest and supported a reserve accumulation of almost $ 8 billion in 2005.
Fiscal consolidation continued for the fifth year in a row, with the general government deficit
kept to 0.8 percent of GDP—below the target of 1 percent of GDP and a deficit of 1 percent
of GDP in 2004. The financial system is healthy and robust, well positioned to absorb
adverse shocks.

December 2004.
2

Against the NBR’s target of 5 percent ±1 percent band at end-2006.

-2Progress has been made in implementing structural reforms. Privatization in the
banking sector has continued with the sale of the largest Romanian bank (BCR). The
privatization and deregulation of the gas and electricity market has also continued, and
significant progress has been made in the implementation of the mining sector strategy. Gas
prices remained at 38 percent of the international import prices, a gap that has to be
eliminated by the end of 2008, as recently agreed with the EU.
Looking forward, the authorities are committed to preserving macroeconomic
stability and renewing reform efforts as prerequisites for sustained strong growth. To
contain external imbalances and make noticeable progress with disinflation, the authorities
will further tighten macroeconomic policies. In 2006, tight budget deficit and tight incomes
policy will help monetary policy to fight inflation and reduce pressure for currency
appreciation. The fiscal deficit for this year is envisaged at 0.9 percent of GDP, roughly the
same as last year’s outcome. This represents a small increase compared with this year’s
original budget (which incorporated a 0.5 percent deficit) so as to accommodate some extra
room for investment in infrastructure, education, and flood defense. As to the latter, Romania
is currently experiencing yet another severe flooding of the Danube with many villages,
citizens and businesses strongly affected. The authorities acknowledge that while the recent
sharp leu appreciation has narrowed external competitiveness, the exchange rate remains
competitive, so that a moderate further appreciation would not cause a significant
deterioration in the external balance and could be accommodated.
The authorities are aware that achieving growth consistent with the goal of
convergence to EU living standards requires increased investment and employment
creation. They are improving their project-implementation capacity to absorb all EU funds
and will increase the share of capital spending in the public budget to boost infrastructure. In
addition, they are committed to further improving the investment climate, including by
bringing the institutional framework to greater harmony with EU standards, and continuing
privatization and enterprise restructuring to support productivity gains.
Fiscal policy
In the authorities’ strategy to preserve macroeconomic stability, fiscal policy will
continue to play a central role. In view of Romania’s low public debt, fiscal sustainability
is not a concern. However, prudent fiscal policy and a tight incomes policy are needed to
address excess demand pressure stemming from continued large capital inflows. The
authorities assess that a 0.9 percent defict is appropriate also in view of the fact that the tax
cut and wage hikes that fueled consumption last year would not be repeated this year.
Strengthening revenue will be a key element of the fiscal strategy. Room left for
expenditure compression approaches its limit since recent compression of expenditure
resulted in arrears. Last year the government cleared arrears to the health sector (virtually
eliminating all arrears) and it is its policy to avoid further arrears accumulation. Moreover,
additional revenue will be needed to compensate further cuts in the social contribution tax
aimed at enhancing employment and growth to provide resources for fulfilling Romania’s
contributions to the EU budget and co-financing of EU projects, and to meet modern
infrastructure needs.

-3A comprehensive revision of the fiscal code is ongoing and a draft will be
submitted for Parliament’s approval in June this year. Among the measures envisaged to
raise revenue are increases in some taxes, including taxes on buildings, land, and
transportation means, and also the adoption of new taxes on tobacco and alcohol. The
authorities feel that improved tax collection can still be a significant source of revenue and
plan improvements in tax administration in line with FAD and World Bank
recommendations. The micro-enterprises taxation system will be changed (in line with EU
requirements) as of January 2007 to bring these enterprises under the regular corporate
income tax, a change that is expected to bring additional revenue of about 0.6 percent of
GDP. Royalty increases are also envisaged for water, oil, salt, and sand.
The authorities are preparing to face challenges associated with the expected
sizeable privatization proceeds and EU transfers. Pressure for higher spending can be
strong since privatization inflows in 2006 are expected to be about 3 percent of GDP and
post-accession EU receipts will exceed 2 percent of GDP in the first year of accession. To
deal with this pressure, the government is now finishing a medium-term budgetary
framework, which fully incorporates these funds and also post-accession expenditure. The
authorities plan to continue placing revenue from privatization with the NBR, who invests it
abroad. The authorities are also working on creating mechanisms to ensure the efficient
allocation of resources and absorption of the EU inflows. Drawing on the assistance received
from the World Bank, the authorities started working on improving the quality of public
expenditure, with the objective of overhauling pay and employment practices, improving the
quality of health services, and introducing a second pension pillar.
Wage-policy
Wage policy is aimed at managing demand pressures and protecting the
competitiveness of the Romanian economy. For 2006, the authorities agreed on a prudent
annual increase of 6.5 percent in the statutory minimum wage. Also, the increase in the wage
bill of the SOEs that were monitored under the SBA will be limited to 3.5 percent. The
authorities acknowledge that, given the recent wage increases in the public sector, strict
control of the wage bill is required. To this end, the authorities decided to freeze all vacant
positions in the general government, which is expected to offset wage overruns, and to
monitor wage developments closely. They also look forward to canceling bonuses if
necessary. To anchor inflation expectations, the authorities committed to one wage increase
per year starting in 2007, thus terminating the habit of interim ad hoc increases seen in the
past.
Monetary policy
The NBR is strongly committed to inflation targeting, although last year’s target
was missed by a slight 0.1 percentage points in a difficult environment. Confronted with
strong capital inflows at the time of the adoption of the inflation targeting regime, the NBR
had to intervene heavily in the foreign exchange market and cut interest rates to alleviate the
abrupt appreciation of the leu. The successful arrest of short-term pressures on the exchange
rate came at the cost of a temporary easing of policy, which was reflected in slightly missing
the inflation target last year and may also make meeting the target this year more difficult.

-4The authorities decided to maintain the inflation targets for 2006 and 2007,
while acknowledging that the 2006 target might be difficult to reach and a strong action
plan is needed to achieve the 4-percent target by the end of 2007. A significant revision
of the 2006 target would have been costly in terms of the NBR’s credibility, at least from the
perspective that pressure for wage increases would have been linked to the revision’s
magnitude. In addition to inflationary expectations generated by the 2005 slight miss and to
delayed effects of past monetary easing, this year’s inflation would reflect higher wages and
planned increases in administered prices, the latter contributing 21⁄2-3 percentage point to
headline inflation.
To bring the 2006 target closer within reach and to secure the landing of
inflation at the center of the target range in 2007, the NBR further tightened monetary
policy this year. After resuming full sterilization at the policy interest rate in November
2005, the NBR increased the policy interest rate by 100 basis points to 8.5 percent in
February this year to signal clearly the primacy of inflation over other considerations.
Monetary tightening added pressures on the local currency, which has appreciated by about 5
percent against the euro since the beginning of the year. Further tightening of monetary
policy might follow, depending on the evolution of inflationary pressures.
Credit growth has moderated but the authorities are still cautious since the
effectiveness of administrative measures is likely to diminish over time. Prudential
restrictions have been adopted in July-August 2005 with the aim to tame foreign-currency
lending. In addition, the monetary easing over the course of 2005 has led to a narrowing gap
between local and foreign-currency interest rates. These policy actions have resulted in a
shifting composition of lending and a deceleration of overall lending. The annualized flow of
foreign-currency credit, which reached a peak of 5 percent of GDP in August 2005, turned
negative in December, while local-currency flows have almost doubled to 7 percent of GDP
over the same period. The total annualized credit flow dropped from about 9 percent of GDP
in August to roughly 5 percent of GDP in December 2005. However, with still strong
demand for credit, incentives for borrowers and lenders to find alternative channels for
funding exist. Being aware that prudential measures cannot be used in place of interest rates
without undesirable or unintended consequences, the authorities, consistent in their
commitment to the inflation target, will rely more on the interest rate for stabilization
purposes. Building on the substantial progress made in strengthening the regulatory and
supervisory framework, the NBR will continue the implementation of FSAP
recommendations, including by upgrading its own risk-assessment capacity, especially in
preparation for the introduction of Basel II.
Structural policies
The program for structural reform remains ambitious. Privatization in the
banking sector will continue with the savings bank CEC (the last state-owned bank), for
which final bids are expected in May. Like in the case of BCR, price will weigh most heavily
in selecting investors. The authorities acknowledge that, in addition to the recent
amendments to the Labor Code, further reforms are needed to make the market fully flexible,
including the elimination of the obligatory nature of collective wage contracts for nonsignatory parties. Rapid progress is being made in implementing judicial reform, which helps

-5strengthening governance and improving the business climate. The National Anticorruption
Prosecutor Office, which has been established recently, will be able to investigate and
prosecute members of Parliament.
