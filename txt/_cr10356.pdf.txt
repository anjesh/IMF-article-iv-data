REPUBLIC OF LATVIA
Staff Report for the 2010 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the European Department
(In Consultation with Other Departments)
Approved by Anne-Marie Gulde-Wolf and James Roaf
July 6, 2010
Article IV Consultation and Exchange Rate Regime: The last Article IV consultation was
concluded by the Executive Board October 4, 2006 (Country Report No. 06/353). An FSAP
update in 2007 as well as a supplement in 2008 were circulated to the Board but not discussed.
Latvia operates a conventional peg of the lats to the euro at the rate of €1 = L0.702804 with a
±1 percent band, and entered ERMII in April 2005. Latvia has accepted the obligations
of Article VIII and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions except for some
security-related restrictions and a partial deposit freeze on one bank. A proposal to extend the
restriction related to the deposit freeze, with a view toward eventual removal, was approved in
the context of the June report on delayed Article IV consultations.
Stand-By Arrangement: The Executive Board approved an exceptional access SBA of
SDR 1.52 billion (1,200 percent of quota or approximately €1.7 billion) on December 23, 2008
(Country Report No. 09/3). The Second Review was completed February 17, 2010
(Country Report No. 10/65), when the arrangement was extended until December 22, 2011.
Discussions were held in Riga May 19 to June 4 2010. The mission met with Prime
Minister Dombrovskis, Finance Minister Repše, and political leaders; Bank of Latvia
Governor Rimšēvičs; Head of the Financial and Capital Market Commission Krūmane; senior
officials in these institutions; social partners; and representatives of financial institutions.
Staff: The staff team comprised Mark Griffiths (head), James John, Emilia Jurzyk,
Magnus Saxegaard (all EUR), Alex Klemm (FAD), Michaela Erbenova (MCM), and
Irena Asmundson (SPR). David Moore (Resident Representative) and Lone Christiansen (EUR)
assisted the mission. Gundars Davidsons (OED) attended meetings. The team worked closely
with staff of the European Commission, European Central Bank, World Bank, and the Swedish
authorities.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Latvia’s severe downturn may now be bottoming out. After an 18 percent contraction
in 2009 and substantial volatility due to the unwinding of an unsustainable credit boom, the
global financial crisis, and local banking pressures, market conditions have calmed and
quarterly growth is expected to pick up in the second half of 2010, with annual growth
forecast to resume in 2011.
Strong policy actions have supported stabilization and the authorities’ competitiveness
strategy. Adjustment of 13 percent of GDP has counteracted massive fiscal deterioration due
to the crisis and greatly enhanced the credibility of the authorities’ strategy, although some
measures were low-quality and not sustainable. Deposits have recovered to pre-crisis levels
and a sharp improvement in the current account as well as program support have
strengthened international reserves and restored confidence in the quasi-currency board.
Sharp wage adjustments and deflation have gone a long way toward addressing previously
serious competitiveness problems, with further support from recent euro depreciation.
Immediate risks are now much lower, but key challenges remain to strengthen the
economy and enable euro adoption: boosting growth to reduce unemployment; accelerating
the shift toward the tradable sector; undertaking substantial and durable further fiscal
adjustment; ensuring that competitiveness is restored and maintained; and resolving the
substantial private sector debt overhang that inhibits recovery.
Talks focused on steps to address these challenges, with staff recommending:


Training to match skills needs, improved education, and a lower tax wedge on labor
(fiscal conditions permitting) to stop unemployment becoming entrenched.



Spending measures to achieve large further fiscal adjustment—although revenue
measures should also be prepared—and reforms to improve budget controls to make
the adjustment sustainable, as well as a fiscal responsibility law to anchor future
policies.



Structural reforms to help address a remaining competitiveness gap and support
higher growth and employment through stronger exports in the absence of other
policy options.



Tax and other changes to facilitate market-based debt restructuring.

Despite substantial progress, risks remain. The new government will need to make a clear
commitment to the strategy of enhancing competitiveness and fiscal adjustment to make it
work. Sustained high unemployment would add to spending pressures, while not resolving
bad loans and restoring financial sector health would also drag down growth. Failure to
undertake structural reforms could undermine competitiveness under a fixed exchange rate.
Additional risks include possible delays in euro adoption and spillovers from adverse
developments in Western Europe.
The authorities generally shared staff views, but were more optimistic on the
medium-term recovery path, and believe that fewer fiscal measures would be needed to meet
the Maastricht targets. With considerable real exchange rate adjustment having already
occurred, the authorities were confident their strategy to rebuild competitiveness was
working.

5
I. BACKGROUND
A. From Boom to Bust1
1.
During the 2000s Latvia’s economy grew extremely rapidly, helped by capital
inflows and expansionary macroeconomic policies. Growth averaged 7.5 percent in the
first part of the decade, driven by structural reforms ahead of European Union (EU)
accession. Following EU membership in 2004, growth accelerated into double digits
(Figure 1). Increased confidence in the peg caused interest rates to fall, leading to a boom
typical of exchange rate based stabilizations. Substantial inflows from Nordic parent banks
into Latvia’s small economy fuelled rapid credit expansion, largely foreign currencydenominated, which financed increasing current account deficits. Investment primarily in
non-tradables contributed to a dramatic real estate bubble. Though strong revenue growth
pushed the budget into small surplus by 2007, between 2001 and 2007 government spending
doubled in real terms.
2.
The boom proved unsustainable. Inflation increased, worsening competitiveness
and turning real interest rates negative, which increased domestic demand, further fuelling
the boom (Figure 2). Fund advice to tighten fiscal policy was largely ignored (Box 1). The
Bank of Latvia (BoL) raised its refinancing rate largely in line with European Central Bank
(ECB) changes, and increased reserve requirements in 2004 and 2005, but annual credit
growth remained high. Latvia’s non-financial private sector debt rose rapidly from 35 percent
of GDP in 2000 to 116 percent in 2007—in Europe an increase matched only by Iceland and
Spain—and was a key source of vulnerability. The current account deficit rose to more
than 20 percent of GDP in 2006 and 2007, increasing Latvia’s net external debt to 50 percent
of GDP. Foreign banks, overexposed to the Baltics, started to slow lending in early 2007. By
end-2007 GDP had started to fall, and then global prospects worsened.
3.
Financial sector vulnerabilities turned the slowdown into crisis (Figure 3,
Table 1). Private sector deposits fell almost 10 percent between end-August and
end-November. Post-Lehman, at first there were doubts over the health of Swedish banks,
but the Swedish government’s announcement in September of a support package restored
confidence. Then speculation over Parex Bank’s (the second largest bank, and largest
domestically owned) ability to pay its syndicated loans caused a run on the bank: its deposits
fell 25 percent creating a severe liquidity shortage, and necessitating a deposit freeze. The
initial attempt to partially nationalize Parex was mishandled and deposits fell steeply until
agreement on the SBA was announced on December 19. Aside from the turmoil in
international markets, Latvian banks’ funding model (relying relatively more than
neighboring countries on nonresident deposits and short-term syndicated loans) and lax
1

boom, the causes of the crisis, and financial sector developments and policy responses.

6
lending standards during the boom exacerbated its crisis. The BoL cut reserve requirements
to increase banks’ liquidity, but customers converted withdrawals into foreign currency,
draining international reserves. To prevent international reserve cover of base money from
falling below 100 percent (potentially threatening the currency board), ensure sufficient
funds to meet depositor withdrawals, and address a rapidly deteriorating fiscal position due to
falling revenue and financial sector costs, in November 2008 the authorities approached the
Fund and European Commission (EC) for emergency financial support.
Box 1: Effectiveness of Past IMF Advice Prior to the Crisis
In 2006, the Fund warned of risks from overheating and recommended a tighter fiscal stance
including slower public wage growth, more effective real estate taxation to cool mortgage borrowing
and moderate credit growth, strong banking supervision, and efforts to boost productivity and exports.
The 2008 Article IV staff report, which was not discussed by the Board, also called for a tighter fiscal
stance and steps to strengthen the tradable sector, while emphasizing the need for precautionary
financial buffers and contingency planning.
The authorities maintained a stimulative fiscal stance until late in the boom despite double-digit
growth and inflation, although in 2007 they did expand real estate taxation and refrain from a
generalized personal income tax cut. To slow rapid credit growth and inflation, the authorities in 2007
required banks to grant loans only on the basis of legally reported income, required a 10 percent
minimum down payment, and strengthened loan-to-value requirements to slow the rapid credit
growth, but later reversed the last two measures. The authorities heeded advice to reinstate limits on
banks’ net open position in euros in 2007, but did not follow recommendations to raise the minimum
capital adequacy ratio. Most of the recommendations of the 2007 FSAP Update were implemented,
except for creating a more favorable environment for out-of-court debt restructuring, and events
showed that the authorities’ contingency planning was not sufficient to avoid serious challenges when
banks came under pressure.

B. Program Strategy
4.
Mindful of the fragile world economy, Fund staff considered a wide range of
options to stabilize Latvia and stem the risk of contagion.2 Fund staff were ready to
consider exchange rate depreciation, probably through step adjustment of the peg combined
with full use of the ±15 percent margins allowed under ERMII (and the prospect of credible
ECB intervention if these bands were tested), or through accelerated euro introduction at a
depreciated rate, although this latter option was dismissed as inconsistent with the Maastricht
Treaty. Depreciation would have boosted exports, allowed lower interest rates, and eased
pressures on international reserves, although high pass-through could have led to rapid
inflation and limited the competitiveness benefits. However, given the high share of foreign
currency borrowing, depreciation would have immediately damaged household and corporate
balance sheets. This could have resulted in increased private sector defaults, collapsing
domestic demand and a deeper initial recession. The counter-argument is that these balance
2

discussion of program strategy and exchange rate options.

7
sheet effects would also happen eventually under internal devaluation, since falling wages
and prices and rising unemployment would make it harder to service debts, but the process
would take place over time, potentially allowing banks to adjust. Perhaps the strongest—and
hardest to quantify—argument against depreciation was the risk it would encourage
speculative attacks against other European countries with pegs. Post Lehman Brothers, the
outcome of this could have been quite uncertain.
5.
Reflecting their view of the potential costs, the authorities insisted on basing the
program strategy on maintaining the peg—a pillar of economic stability since 1994. The
program is built on fiscal adjustment and internal devaluation—wage and price cuts and
productivity boosting reforms—to improve competitiveness and reduce the current account
deficit. Given the authorities’ strong preference for this approach, and substantial financial
support from the EC and Nordic and other EU countries (Sweden, Denmark, Norway,
Finland, Estonia, the Czech Republic, and Poland), the Fund supported the authorities’
adjustment program (the World Bank and EBRD also provided assistance, financial and
technical). An international support package of €7.5 billion (€3.1 billion from the EC,
€1.7 billion Fund and €1.8 billion Nordics) was assembled and designed to be sufficiently
large to convince markets the peg would stay.

C. Stabilization and Recovery
6.
Though the fixed exchange rate strategy avoided the balance sheet effects of
disorderly devaluation, the recession proved far steeper than envisaged at end-2008
(Figure 4). Output fell 18 percent in 2009, the deepest recession in the world. Unemployment
increased to 17 percent. These worse than expected outcomes were mirrored around the
world, but they were magnified in Latvia (and the other Baltic countries) due to unwinding of
the imbalances built up during the preceding boom.

7.

The recession caused wage and price deflation:



Wages fell 10 percent in 2009, led by the public sector (potentially large declines in
undeclared “envelope” wages may mean the private sector wage drop is understated)
(Figure 5).



Consumer prices fell 1.4 percent during 2009 (end of period); excluding increases
in VAT and excises, prices fell 6.5 percent.



Lower prices and wages have improved competitiveness. Although nominal
depreciations among trading partners meant the CPI based real effective exchange
rate did not peak until February 2009, it has since depreciated by around 10 percent
(Figures 2 and 6).

12
8.
The deep recession and improved competitiveness pushed the current account
into substantial surplus in 2009 and early 2010 (Figure 7, Table 6). Goods exports fell
21 percent in 2009, in part because of lower export prices, but imports fell even more, by
40 percent, due to collapsing domestic demand. A large part of the 9 percent of GDP current
account surplus in 2009 reflects foreign banks writing off losses in Latvia—around 6 percent
of GDP—that will likely prove transitory (these losses are recorded as positive for the
income account although no funds are actually transferred; the net international investment
position improves).
9.
Despite substantial international support, questions over Latvia’s ability to
implement the program initially undermined attempts to restore confidence in the
exchange rate peg. The government’s collapse in February 2009, followed by doubts over
the successor government’s ability to deliver fiscal adjustment, weakened the lats within the
narrow fluctuation band. Interbank interest rates increased to more than 30 percent, while the
CDS peaked at 1200 basis points (Figures 3). Failure of a Treasury bill auction contributed to
the panic. From end-2008 to end-June, non-resident deposits fell by about 32 percent;
residents increased their foreign currency deposit share from 49 percent to 58 percent.
International reserves fell to €2.8 billion. That said, even these sizeable outflows fell short of
what had been allowed for when the program was originally designed.3
10.
Following passage of the 2009 supplementary budget in June (Figure 8, Table 3)
and disbursement of additional international support, confidence improved markedly.
Market volatility began to subside, and calmed even more in November and December
following approval of the 2010 budget (which included an ambitious 4 percent of GDP fiscal
adjustment). Deposits returned as current account surpluses and program disbursements
increased international reserves, boosting confidence in the peg and in the financial system,
and contributing to growth in broad money. Cash in circulation and banks’ lats liquidity have
also increased (banks so far have been generally unwilling to lend this liquidity) and interest
rates fell (Figure 12, Tables 9 and 10). Since October, the BoL has rarely had to intervene,
and international reserves have increased to €5.5 billion (Figure 9). In early 2010, ratings
agencies raised their outlook from negative to stable. At first Latvia seemed relatively
insulated from the turbulence in Greece, but CDS rates have risen recently like other CEE
countries, following increased international financial market tensions.
11.
The weak economy is putting pressure on the banking sector (Figures 10 and 11,
Table 11). New overdue loans have stabilized, but non-performing loans and provisioning
needs remain high. Banks have responded by pre-emptive recapitalization, raising the
system-wide capital adequacy ratio to almost 15 percent.
12.

Despite the deep recession, there are signs the economy is stabilizing:



The pace of output decline is slowing. In the first quarter of 2010, seasonally
adjusted GDP seems to have leveled off, and the year-on-year decline has slowed to
6 percent.



Real sector indicators are turning. Apart from a setback at the end of last year,
industrial production has been increasing since March 2009. Real estate prices have
started to increase (after falling 70 percent from their peak). Retail sales have
generally increased since December 2009. However, construction activity and sales of
consumer durables continue to decline.

13.
Consistent with the authorities’ strategy to rebuild competitiveness, exports have
started to pick up, increasing 17 percent year-on-year in the first quarter of 2010. Wood
exports have been particularly strong.

II. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
14.
The authorities face two main challenges: converting the recent economic
stabilization into sustained economic recovery, and ensuring euro adoption by 2014, the
program’s exit strategy. Discussions focused on:


restoring growth and reducing unemployment;



completing the fiscal adjustment to meet the Maastricht criteria and replace program
support with market financing;



success of the authorities’ strategy of wage and price cuts and productivity boosting
reforms in addressing the competitiveness gap;



resolving the private sector debt overhang to stimulate credit growth and domestic
demand;



structural reforms to improve competitiveness and raise potential growth.
A. Restoring Growth

15.
Staff projects the economy will start to grow in the second half of 2010, but
much slower than before the crisis, with the output gap closed slowly (Table 2).
Continued contributions from net exports plus positive public and private consumption
growth are expected to lead to a pickup in quarter-on-quarter growth in the second half of
2010. In the last two years, potential growth has slowed markedly and the sharp GDP
contraction has created a sizable
output gap. Assuming unemployment 10000 RealGDP (million lats)

growth by an additional 2–3 percent.

24
16.
Inflation should remain subdued. Near-term inflation is rising faster than expected
due to energy and food prices (including regulated prices), and euro depreciation. Deflation
is projected to end in 2011, but the persistent output gap and continued fiscal consolidation
keeps wage and price inflation well below euro area levels through 2015.
17.
Over the medium-term, growth shifts back towards domestic demand. Some of
the recent substantial contribution of net exports to growth reflects temporary factors such as
collapsing import demand. External demand is forecast to be weak with further downside risk
from developments in Western Europe. But with fiscal policy likely to be contractionary, at
least until the Maastricht targets are reached, stronger domestic demand will depend on banks
increasing lending, including by converting excess liquidity into new credit growth.
18.
The current account—in large surplus in 2009 after years of deficits—is
expected to decline gradually but remain in surplus. Within the current account, a rising
trade surplus compensates for weakening transfers and factor incomes, with potential for
significant growth in transportation-related services exports, exploiting Latvia’s EU
connections and transit links with CIS countries (which streamlined customs procedures
could enhance). Current account surpluses will be balanced by continuing gradual outflows
from financial sector deleveraging. FDI not associated with financial sector recapitalizations
is projected to remain weak, but could outperform with improvements in competitiveness and
the business environment.
19.
Internal and external debt are expected to stabilize at lower levels. Current
account surpluses, equity recapitalizations, and deleveraging by banks will help external debt
decline (Figure 14, Tables 7 and 8). Fiscal adjustment will reverse the recent sharp rise in
public debt, and if some program financing is foregone, Latvia’s public debt could remain
below the Maastricht threshold of 60 percent of GDP (Figure 15, Tables 4 and 5).
B. Reducing Unemployment
20.
The recession has pushed unemployment above 20 percent (Figure 13). When the
program was launched, flexible labor markets were expected to moderate wages and improve
competitiveness. Instead, the private sector has adjusted more through job losses than wage
cuts, in part because the boom had left the economy with structural imbalances. Since
late 2007, more than 200,000 jobs have been lost, about one-fifth of total employment
pre-crisis. Construction employment has halved, contributing roughly one third of all job
losses with male and less skilled workers hurt most; the resulting skills mismatch (new jobs
are more likely in the traded goods sector) will likely increase the natural unemployment
rate. Youth unemployment has increased to 43 percent, and long-term unemployment to
32 percent of all unemployed. Despite the recession in Europe, migration has also increased,
with 1 percent of Latvia’s population leaving since the end of 2007 (and anecdotal reports of
higher outflows), which will help address unemployment, but could also reduce skilled

25
workers in Latvia. Unless unemployment falls quickly, there is a risk that hysteresis effects
could raise the natural rate and make higher unemployment permanent.
21.
The government has taken emergency measures to cushion the impact. First, it
has introduced active labor market schemes. The Workplace with Stipend (WWS) program,
supported by the World Bank and EC, has provided jobs for those not receiving
unemployment benefits. Through mid-May, around 19,000 jobs had been created, 35,000
people had participated, and 53,000 were on the waiting list. Around half who participated
were at risk of social exclusion (long-term unemployed, young, or ex-convicts). The low
stipend (L100 or €140 per month) should provide sufficient incentive to seek other
employment as soon as the labor market recovers. That a stipend below the minimum wage
(L180 per month) has attracted so many job-seekers suggests the minimum wage could be a
constraint on employment (though the bunching of wages around the minimum may reflect
increasing use of additional envelope payments). The Ministry of Welfare is also providing
skills training to the unemployed: participants receive a lower stipend than in the WWS
program (70 lats per month). Second, it has extended the duration and coverage of
unemployment benefits, but these are relatively low (falling to €65 per month after a few
months) and terminate after nine months.
22.
Given constraints to expansionary macroeconomic policy, unemployment
reduction will depend on structural reforms, though Latvia’s deficiencies are hard to
pinpoint. Some survey data suggest labor market rigidities are a problem, but this does not
square with the reality of sizeable job cuts. World Economic Forum rankings suggest
relatively flexible labor markets, as illustrated by wage setting policies (low unionization),
high correlation between pay and productivity, and high female participation.
23.

Discussions focused on structural reforms to boost employment:



Unemployment benefits seem too low to be the problem. Consistent with World Bank
advice, the mission suggested extending benefits given the likelihood unemployment
will persist.



To lower the tax wedge and protect take-home pay, any minimum wage cuts could be
combined with labor tax cuts for the low-paid (who face a tax wedge of almost
40 percent).



In the short run, increasing domestic demand could help reduce unemployment before
hysteresis sets in. Debt restructuring and strengthening the financial system to boost
credit could help here, and could also facilitate new capital investment in tradables.



For the longer term, the authorities need to focus on improving educational
performance, where Latvia lags. The share of students graduating from science

26
departments is among the lowest in the EU. In spite of high unemployment, finding
skilled labor in certain sectors (manufacturing) remains difficult.

C. Completing the Fiscal Adjustment
24.
Without fiscal measures, the deep recession would have raised Latvia’s budget
deficit to unsustainably high levels. Lower tax revenues (especially corporate and indirect
taxes), the denominator effect of huge falls in GDP on government expenditure ratios, higher
spending on interest payments, and unemployment benefits and pensions would have
increased the deficit to over 20 percent of GDP.
25.
To preserve debt sustainability, the authorities have taken around 13 percent of
GDP in fiscal tightening measures during the program. Expenditure cuts have dominated
the adjustment. The wage bill was cut by 4 percent of GDP (an average 30 percent wage cut
for central government employees, though some workers such as teachers suffered more);
pensions were initially cut by 10 percent (70 percent for working pensioners), though this
was later reversed by the Constitutional Court; and investment was cut by 3 percent of GDP.
Higher taxes raised around 2 percent of GDP. The personal income tax was increased by
3 percentage points to 26 percent (reversing a 2 percent cut early in 2009); the tax-free
personal income tax allowance was cut from L90 (€125) to L35 (€50) per month; VAT was
increased from 18 to 21 percent, and the reduced rate increased from 5 to 10 percent.
26.
The scale of fiscal adjustment achieved in such a limited time is impressive, but
designing quality measures proved challenging given the need for quick action. The
government’s pension cut was ruled unconstitutional for violating pensioners’ legitimate
expectations. The 70 percent cut for working pensioners was high, violated the principle of
the notional defined contribution system, and some working pensioners lacked time to
de-register from working to avoid the cut. Legislation governing the new withholding tax and
taxes on the private use of company cars was unclear, implementation inconsistent, and
revenue yields of company car taxation were one-fifth of expectations. In part because of the
difficulty of reaching consensus across ministries run by different coalition partners, together
with the Ministry of Finance’s (MoF) weak central authority, there has been excessive
reliance on across-the-board cuts rather than removing unnecessary functions to find savings.
Despite the later introduction of a wage grid, public sector pay cuts were uneven, with central
government staff and teachers bearing the greatest burden, while local governments and
especially state owned enterprises have reduced wages much less. Cuts in personal income
tax allowances were highly regressive, pushing the adjustment burden largely onto the poor
(when Latvia already has the highest inequality, as measured by the Gini coefficient, in the
EU). Some of the cuts in investment and maintenance may not be sustainable and could
increase future costs. Instead, structural spending reforms (and perhaps progressive income
taxes) would have been preferable, but the authorities’ approach has yielded substantial
savings in a short time, and held up better than expected.

27.
To meet the Maastricht deficit criteria by 2012, staff estimates a further
6 percent of GDP in adjustment remains necessary:


On unchanged policies, the deficit should increase to around 8½ percent of GDP
in 2011 and 2012, with a further 6 percent of GDP in measures required to achieve
the Maastricht target. The authorities argued for slightly lower adjustment pointing to
strengthening revenue. Staff noted that higher unemployment and artificially low
investment and maintenance outlays could increase spending risks.



While continued adjustment might worsen the recession, delaying it would increase
government debt (which private markets have been unwilling to finance), making the
Maastricht criteria even harder to fulfill and undermining the euro adoption strategy.

28.
International experience suggests expenditure cuts, particularly current
spending, generate more sustainable adjustment. Latvia’s deficit reflects higher spending,
which since the early 2000s had increased by 13 percent of GDP (8 percent excluding EU
funds-related spending). Much of this reflects constant nominal spending and declining GDP;
but since there will likely be a permanent output loss, expenditure needs to adjust. The
largest increase came in subsidies and transfers, which now comprise more than half of
general government spending, especially pension costs which more than doubled
between 2005 and 2010, when nominal GDP increased by only one-third.
29.
Though the authorities prefer to adjust entirely through expenditure cuts, they
prepared a medium-term tax strategy which could also raise revenue. The strategy
foresees abolishing reduced VAT rates, increasing residential real estate tax, and lowering
the labor tax wedge when and if affordable. While the initial draft strategy was ambitious,
subsequent revisions include restrictions that could curb its effectiveness (such as limiting the
tax-to-GDP ratio to 30 percent, or ruling out increases in PIT, VAT and CIT rates). The

30
proposal for a single rate VAT would reflect best practice, but this year’s decision to cut
hotel VAT is at odds with the strategy.
30.
Staff encouraged the authorities to develop structural fiscal reforms to ensure
sustained adjustment. The MoF’s powers need strengthening to enforce fiscal discipline.
Currently, the Cabinet of Ministers or groups of parliamentarians can propose tax cuts or
spending increases without the finance minister’s consent, even if these increase the deficit.
Latvia’s history of short-lived coalition governments makes this common. During the budget
such amendments have to be deficit-neutral, but outside the budget there is no restriction,
undermining the purpose of the annual budget and making it hard to ensure fiscal targets are
met.
31.
The authorities largely agreed, but claimed that giving the finance minister veto
rights on tax or spending proposals would require constitutional amendment. Staff
recommended alternatives such as requiring appropriations increases, even outside the
budget consideration period, be accompanied by offsets. Staff also recommended that all tax
policy measures be assessed and approved by the MoF before submission to the cabinet. The
authorities claimed that such a provision already existed, but staff noted this has not
prevented tax measures from reaching the cabinet without proper evaluation.
32.
The authorities intend to include a fiscal rule in their planned Fiscal
Responsibility Law to guide policy once the Maastricht criteria have been reached. One
of the authorities’ proposals—balance the budget when growth equals potential and
automatically allow deficits (require surpluses) when growth is lower (higher)—would likely
achieve the goals of counter-cyclical and sustainable fiscal policies. The mission reiterated
that, unless the finance minister’s powers were enhanced, or the rule made binding with
higher status than other laws, this reform would have little impact. Especially as in Latvia,
new laws supersede old, so there is a risk that new budget legislation would override a Fiscal
Responsibility Law, although this would still impose a reputational cost.
33.
Fiscal control of state-owned enterprises needs to be improved. Latvia has many
state-owned enterprises (SOE), controlled by various line ministries (run by different
coalition parties) with limited MoF oversight. This hampers fiscal transparency and
subjects the government to contingent risks. Many are not really enterprises, but should be
considered government agencies or part of central government (e.g., the SOE responsible for
roads). The mission advised the government to prepare a complete list of SOEs, including
essential information on profits, subsidies, wages, employment, and dividend payments.
Strategic analysis should then determine which SOEs could be brought back into the budget,
and which could be considered for privatization. The Ministry of Economy (MoE) had
already established a working group covering these issues.
34.
Tax laws need to be drafted more clearly and their application made more
transparent. The mission recommended that the State Revenue Service publish tax rulings

31
promptly to reduce taxpayers’ uncertainties, publish answers to tax questions, and establish a
provision for advance decisions on tax queries.
D. Improving Competitiveness Through Internal Devaluation
35.
Latvia is pursuing an internal devaluation strategy to address competitiveness
concerns. From 2005 to their peak in early 2009, the CPI- and PPI-based real effective
exchange rates appreciated roughly 30 percent, while the ULC measure increased 50 percent.
Starting in 2000, the appreciation is around 10 percentage points less, though still significant.
These indicators plus large current account deficits pointed to substantial exchange rate
overvaluation before the crisis. With considerable progress under the program—the current
account has moved into surplus and real exchange rates have depreciated—it is appropriate
to reassess competitiveness.
36.
Staff’s application of the CGER methodology yields a wide range of assessments
of the competitiveness gap. The equilibrium real exchange rate (ERER) approach still
points to a large competitiveness gap, with the main determinants productivity (which has
deteriorated) and the amount of government consumption. The macro-balance (MB) and
external sustainability (ES) approaches indicate slight undervaluation but results are highly
sensitive to estimates of the output gap and other temporary factors used to construct the
underlying current account. Other plausible assumptions for the output gap and underlying
current account position would point to a remaining competitiveness gap.
37.
The BoL argued strongly against any suggestion of exchange rate overvaluation.
Its interpretation of CGER methods even indicated slight undervaluation. For the ERER
approach, choice of a shorter sample length yielded an overvaluation of only about
10 percent. To correct for the exclusion of Latvia in the derivation of the original ERER
coefficients, BoL staff also estimated a country-specific model. However, the results
depended in part on Latvia having become relatively more closed since joining the EU, and a
shorter data sample was used compared to staff estimates. For the MB and ES methods, the
BoL’s preferred approaches to calculating the underlying current account deficit and on the
output gap and crisis effects yielded large undervaluation.
38.

More qualitative indicators also present a mixed competitiveness assessment:



Before the crisis a sizeable competitiveness gap had emerged. From the beginning
of 2005 through end-2008, wages and prices increased roughly 120 and 40 percent,
well above Estonia and Lithuania (Figure 6), and much higher than Germany, one of
Latvia’s major trading partners and a key country for the euro, to which Latvia is
pegged. Unit labor costs increased 93 percent, compared with around 50 percent in
Lithuania and Estonia.



Competitiveness indicators have since improved considerably. After peaking in
early 2009 consumer and producer price-based real effective exchange rates have
depreciated 10 percent. This may even understate the true improvement, since part of

32
the CPI increase comes from higher VAT, which exporters do not pay. Recent
weakening of the euro—the nominal effective exchange rate has depreciated
5 percent so far this year—has provided a further boost to competitiveness, as
evidenced by stronger export growth to non-euro zone countries. And while consumer
prices have increased in recent months, price pressures are concentrated in tradable
sectors, with nontradable prices expected to decline further, suggesting that
competitiveness is likely to continue improving.


Unit labor cost real effective exchange rates have depreciated around 10 percent.
The BoL argues that improvements in marginal unit labor costs are even greater,
since unemployed workers will accept wages well below the average. But these
workers may also have below average productivity and need retraining.



The economy is rebalancing towards tradables. Market shares are improving and
exports have increased strongly. Although Latvia’s share of EU trade fell in 2009, the
BoL’s constant market share analysis suggests this reflected greater than average falls
in partner-country demand and in demand for the types of exports Latvia produces;
correcting for these, competitiveness improved.

39.
In staff’s view, even though there has been substantial improvement, there is still
evidence of a small competitiveness gap of around 10 percent (based on end-2009 data).
EC staff, acknowledging the very large uncertainty underlying misalignment estimates, shared
the broad conclusion that a moderate competitiveness gap might still exist while noting that
ongoing trends would reduce it further. While it is hard to draw definitive conclusions from
CGER estimates, simpler approaches suggest that Latvia’s price level still seems high,
including for its level of per capita GDP. Also, in staff’s view the 15 percent natural rate of
unemployment implicit in the BoL’s calculations is undesirably high; reducing it will require
further competitiveness improvements to expand and redirect output towards tradables. That
said, staff accept that the profound structural changes in the Latvian economy render any
numerical assessment of competitiveness especially uncertain. Arguably more important,
there was clear evidence that competitiveness has improved considerably, and that further
wage and price adjustment, together with structural reforms, have the potential to close the
remaining competitiveness gap. The authorities’ commitment to their strategy to rebuild
competitiveness is consistent with its quasi-currency board regime and supportive of
achieving domestic and external stability. The recent record of rising exports, sustained
current account surpluses, and reserve inflows have all improved confidence in this strategy
and in the exchange rate peg.
E. Financial Stability
40.
Rapid expansion of Latvia’s financial sector during the boom and reliance on
wholesale external funding increased vulnerabilities. Commercial bank assets increased
dramatically from 2001 to 2007, fuelled by sharp growth in banks’ foreign liabilities which

33
increased to 86 percent of GDP, accounting for nearly 60 percent of total liabilities. This
exposed the financial sector to international shocks and funding pressures. Nordic banks led
the lending boom, and supervisors were either unwilling or unable to coordinate and address
the risks of too rapid credit growth. To compete, domestic banks relied heavily on short-term
syndicated borrowing and non-resident deposits, which exposed them to confidence shocks.
The run on Parex Bank in late 2008 and the government’s massive liquidity support and
recapitalization illustrated Latvia’s vulnerabilities. Banking sector related fiscal costs could
have been even larger but for recapitalizations of foreign subsidiaries by parent banks.
41.
The authorities have responded by introducing safeguards to minimize future
financial system vulnerabilities (Box 2). Staff encouraged the FCMC to enforce these
regulations and to continue active participation in EU discussions on the regulatory
framework, liquidity, and capital requirements. Many of the qualitative aspects of the
forthcoming liquidity risk management standards have already been put in place, but the
authorities recognize the importance of banks’ securing stable funding over a range of
maturities. The authorities support efforts to strengthen bank capital, but expressed concerns
about potential changes that would increase volatility in banks’ own funds and erode quality
and consistency of their capital bases. Since a leverage ratio is unlikely to be an effective
counter-cyclical tool for Latvian banks, the authorities support the need to introduce
counter-cyclical regulatory measures but are somewhat skeptical on a number of proposed
buffers and their interoperability. While money laundering and terrorist financing
vulnerabilities related to due diligence on non-resident customers and fit and proper
requirements exist, the authorities appear committed to addressing them, as illustrated by the
recent decision to intervene a bank and withdraw its license because its shareholders were not
deemed fit and proper.

34

Box 2: Regulatory Steps Strengthening The Financial Sector
Strengthened bank resolution framework: A bank resolution strategy was developed in
August 2009 with assistance from the World Bank, and internal FCMC guidelines were introduced
which specify prompt remedial action for troubled banks before regulatory thresholds are breached.
At the same time, amendments to the Law on Credit Institutions and the FCMC Law in
February 2009 significantly strengthened the FCMC’s ability to intervene troubled banks. Finally, the
Law on Bank Takeovers—which came into effect in December 2008—sets out the framework that
permits the government to take over banks if necessary.
Emergency Liquidity Assistance: The BoL issued regulations in January 2009 to strengthen
institutional arrangements for emergency liquidity support.
The Deposit Guarantee Fund’s institutional framework and legal basis were strengthened to
enhance the credibility of the guarantee while allowing the FCMC to increase insurance premiums
after a payout to replenish the fund’s resources. The DGF also was transformed into an autonomous
unit with dedicated staff.
Credit and liquidity risk: In March 2009, the FCMC introduced revised regulations on asset
classification and provisioning and issued new Pillar 2 Basel II regulations on the Capital Adequacy
Assessment Process. Liquidity risk management and credit risk management regulations were revised
in December 2009. The amended regulations on liquidity risk account for developments in
international best practice, inter alia, by putting more emphasis on the management of funding risks
arising from reliance on short-term wholesale funding and by specifying stress testing requirements
and the criteria for determining the size of liquidity buffers. The regulations on credit risk clarify the
methodology for determining acceptable credit risk levels and the requirements for managing
concentration risk, stress testing, and contingency plans. A recent FCMC circular clarifies the
prudential treatment of special entities set up by banks to manage seized property or other problem
assets.
Financial sector supervision has been strengthened by stronger cooperation between the BoL and
the FCMC and reporting requirements have been improved by increasing the frequency and quality of
reporting on restructured loans to enhance assessments of asset quality. At the same time, improved
cooperation between the BoL and the FCMC—in particular in the area of stress testing—has
strengthened the authorities’ understanding of macrofinancial risks and linkages.
Cross-border cooperation with parent banks’ supervisors intensified through participation in
supervisory colleges. Six group-specific Memoranda of Understanding on information exchange have
been signed with home supervisors and one is in the pipeline. The Nordic-Baltic Agreement on
cooperation on cross-border financial stability, crisis management and resolution was signed in
late 2009. Amendments to the Law on Credit Institutions that were drafted to transpose provisions of
the Capital Requirements Directive II and sent to banks for comments in May 2010 will further
enhance home-host cooperation.

35
F. Debt Restructuring
42.
Unwinding of the credit boom has increased debt distress. NPLs—loans more
than 90 days overdue—exceeded 18 percent of total loans in April, and are spreading from
mortgages and real estate to more sectors. Although new overdue loans appear to be
declining due to the improving economic environment and continued low euro interest rates,
the stock of NPLs will likely remain high for several years in part because bankruptcy
proceedings in Latvia average 3 years relative to 1.7 years in the OECD (World Bank Doing
Business 2010).
43.
Latvia’s large debt stock could hinder growth. The debt overhang may constrain
credit availability as banks increase loan-loss provisions, lose interest income, and tighten
lending standards. The decline in asset prices reduces private consumption for households,
and reduces collateral and hurts investment for corporates. This could cause a debt-deflation
spiral.
44.
The authorities are attempting market-based approaches to debt restructuring.
Drawing on World Bank and Fund assistance, the authorities have introduced guidelines for
out-of-court restructuring and are improving the corporate and personal insolvency regimes.
Eighteen percent of loans were reported as restructured in April 2010, more than double the
amount at end-2008, while the amount of loans where banks are taking credit enforcement
action, including foreclosing on collateral, invoking guarantees, and initiating insolvency
proceedings has almost trebled. The full benefits of the reforms to the insolvency framework
will only become evident once market participants and the legal system become familiar with
the new framework. However, anecdotal evidence suggests voluntary restructurings
generally do not reduce the net present value of outstanding debt, so there is a risk debt
distress may recur. Conversely, legal protection (rehabilitation) and insolvency proceedings
usually lead to a very high haircut for unsecured creditors who may then suffer financial
distress.
45.
Staff argued further tax and legal changes would improve incentives for
write-downs and reduce bankruptcy and foreclosure costs, thereby increasing recovery
rates:


Foreclosure auctions are currently cash-only, which limits the number of bidders,
depresses real estate prices, and contributes to the gray economy. Allowing buyers to
pledge purchased assets for a loan could increase bids and asset prices.



Costs of foreclosures and bankruptcy proceedings are relatively high in Latvia—
13 percent of insolvent estates compared to an 8 percent OECD average—due to
lengthy court procedures and high fees for insolvency practitioners. Proposals to link
administrators’ remuneration to recoveries (rather than hourly fees) should lower
these costs, but may not go far enough.

36


The tax system discourages debt restructuring. Debt write-downs can increase banks’
tax liabilities, since loan-loss provisions are tax deductible but write-offs are not,
unless all legal means to recover the debt have been exhausted. The debtor’s gain is
also taxable and rules for applying the tax are unclear. In addition, the 2 percent
stamp duty creates an additional loss when real estate collateral is sold. Making losses
deductible for banks, suspending temporarily personal income tax liability for
write-offs, and eliminating stamp duty once fiscal space allows, could help promote
debt restructuring and reduce the stock of NPLs. It would be important to avoid
creating loopholes that would allow tax evasion.



If these obstacles can be addressed, prospects for market-based restructuring in Latvia
are good given the absence of debt securitization, the prevalence of single creditor
structures, and relatively long maturities on most loans.
G. Structural Reform

46.
Structural reforms are needed to restore growth and competitiveness. While the
boom obscured the importance of productivity-enhancing measures, the recession increases
their urgency, especially given the authorities’ strategy of fiscal consolidation and
maintaining the peg.
47.
Business environment surveys suggest Latvia lags other Baltic and EU 27
countries in some respects. However, the mixed results do not suggest obvious solutions:


The World Economic Forum’s 2009–10 Global Competitiveness Report ranks Latvia
68 out of 133 countries, well behind Estonia (35) and Lithuania (53), and 25th out of
the EU 27. Latvia scores poorly on business sophistication and innovation. The labor
market is partly efficient: wage-setting is among the most flexible in the world, but
rigidity of employment scores poorly. Few businesses cited restrictive labor
regulations as an obstacle to doing business, but did point to inefficient government
bureaucracy.



Latvia ranks well below Estonia, and slightly below Lithuania, in Transparency
International’s 2009 Corruption Perceptions Index. Businesses frequently noted
corruption, in particular links between business and politics, and politics and the
judiciary, as a key obstacle to doing business.



The MoE’s 2009 business survey cited tax rates most as an obstacle to doing
business. Though this may reflect concerns about tax competition with neighbors,
Latvia’s taxes are low by EU standards, and businesses had the same view during the
low-tax boom years. There are widespread complaints of tax evasion (envelope wages
are common), that this undermines trust in government and peoples’ tolerance of
higher tax rates.

48.
Stakeholder meetings also highlighted an unpredictable environment and
governance shortcomings. Businesses argued for a more stable policy environment
especially on taxes (but which have had to increase because of the crisis), but also noted
difficulties in obtaining tax rulings. Business leaders and especially foreign investors pointed
to governance problems, including protection of investor rights and need for extra payments
when bidding for government contracts.
49.
The authorities saw the remaining business environment challenges as relatively
limited. The MoE’s action plan seeks to simplify business start-up procedures and tax
administration, promote e-government and create a one-stop agency for public services, and
support microenterprises, including through simpler taxes. The government is also

38
developing a strategy to reduce the gray economy. While the action plan argued for applying
reduced VAT rates to key industries, this conflicts with the MoF’s strategy of abolishing
reduced VAT rates.
III. STAFF APPRAISAL
50.
Latvia’s economy is showing signs of bottoming out. After substantial volatility
and deep recession in 2009, market conditions have normalized. For 2010 a much smaller
contraction is forecast, followed by sustained growth, although much slower than before the
crisis, including because of substantial private sector indebtedness. Net exports have
cushioned the dramatic decline in domestic demand, and the sharp current account
improvement has strengthened international reserves and will reduce high external debt
levels. While sizeable fiscal adjustment has slowed growth, the authorities have made
progress toward a sustainable deficit level and the Maastricht criteria. Sharp wage
adjustments and deflation have improved competitiveness, with a further benefit from recent
euro depreciation.
51.
Policy efforts have supported stabilization. After initial missteps that heightened
doubts about Latvia’s ability to implement its difficult competitiveness strategy and maintain
the peg, strengthened program implementation, especially through a supplemental 2009
budget and the 2010 budget, helped enhance confidence, including for depositors, and
stabilize international reserves—a key program objective. These budgets helped counteract
massive fiscal deterioration due to the effect of the crisis on GDP and revenue. While
better-than-expected fiscal outcomes were achieved, a more deliberate approach, backed by
structural reforms and less reliant on across-the-board cuts might have made for a more
sustainable fiscal adjustment.
52.
Immediate risks are much lower than last year, but medium-term challenges
remain en route to euro adoption. These include: boosting growth and reducing a very high
level of unemployment; undertaking substantial and durable further fiscal adjustment;
improving competitiveness; and structural reforms to support growth, employment, and
competitiveness. Structural reforms and a strong fiscal stance are essential given the lack of
alternative policy instruments under the fixed exchange rate, and to safeguard long-term
flexibility and competitiveness once Latvia joins the euro area.
53.
The authorities need more creative approaches to reduce unemployment.
Although labor markets appear flexible, and an emergency public works scheme has been
quite successful, the needed structural shift away from construction and toward export
industries will create skill mismatches, on top of potential de-skilling of the long-term
unemployed. Sustained high unemployment is a clear risk. A smaller labor force would limit
potential growth and reduce the tax base, while high long-term unemployment could increase
social spending. With fiscal space limited, the authorities should, in addition to broader
growth-oriented reforms, lower the tax wedge on labor and undertake educational reforms.

39
54.
The authorities should focus on durable spending cuts, but revenue measures
may also be required. With approximately 6 percent of GDP in further savings needed, staff
encouraged early identification of high-quality measures, particularly on the expenditure
side, given steep spending increases during the boom years and international experience on
sustaining fiscal adjustment. Staff noted large past increases in pensions as well as subsidies
and transfers, and welcomed efforts to reexamine the budget for additional savings. Given
the scale of adjustment required, staff also encouraged preparation of tax measures and
welcomed the authorities’ medium-term tax strategy of reducing VAT exemptions and
increasing real estate taxation. This could raise revenue, improve collection efficiency, and
reduce evasion.
55.
Staff encouraged broader consideration of fiscal issues and structural reforms to
improve budgeting practices. Staff encouraged the authorities to consider whether Latvia
wishes to be a relatively low-tax state, or a state that provides more generous benefits—a
tradeoff made clear once the crisis undercut cyclically strong revenues. To improve fiscal
policy formulation and implementation, staff recommended strengthening the MoF’s
authority over the budget process, consideration of a fiscal rule to anchor policies after the
Maastricht criterion is reached, rationalization of state-owned enterprises, and better and
clearer tax administration to improve efficiency and compliance.
56.
The internal devaluation strategy has yielded substantial competitiveness
improvements and enhanced confidence in the peg. While a precise assessment of the real
exchange rate is difficult in the current circumstances, significant adjustment has already
taken place to reduce over-valuation before the crisis. Rising exports, the large swing in the
current account, and reserve inflows have increased confidence in the exchange rate peg and
the internal devaluation strategy. Staff believe a modest competitiveness gap remains, but
that the authorities can close this through further wage and price declines, and structural
reforms.
57.
Staff welcomed efforts to strengthen regulation and supervision to improve
financial stability, including reducing reliance on wholesale external funding. Steps to
bring regulation and supervision in line with evolving international best practice and
strengthen bank resolution procedures, emergency liquidity support, and management of
credit and liquidity risk address key needs. Staff stressed ensuring compliance with
regulations, adequate staffing and resources for the FCMC, and greater attention to maturity
profiles and liquidity risks.
58.
Further steps are needed to facilitate private debt restructuring. These include
making it easier to purchase assets at auctions, lowering costs of insolvency proceedings,
speeding up insolvency and foreclosure procedures, and removing tax impediments
discouraging banks from writing off bad loans or restructuring them.

40
59.
With monetary and fiscal policy constrained by the fixed exchange rate and the
need to reduce the deficit, growth depends on structural reform. Staff welcomed the
authorities’ efforts to make government more efficient and to reduce the gray economy, but
argued against using preferential VAT rates to stimulate sectors. Staff urged stronger
procurement rules and action to address governance concerns.
60.
While economic and financial conditions are much improved, risks remain
significant. Sizeable fiscal adjustment is still needed, but approaching elections have already
led to expansionary measures. The new government will need to make a clear commitment to
the strategy of enhancing competitiveness and fiscal adjustment, for it to succeed. High
unemployment seems hard to address, and may necessitate increased social spending. Bad
loans could inhibit lending and slow growth. And while substantial progress has been made
so far to restore competitiveness, structural reforms are needed to enhance productivity given
the fixed exchange rate constraint and the lack of fiscal space. Any delays in euro adoption
would prolong exchange rate risk, while developments in Western Europe could create a less
favorable external environment.
61.
It is expected that the next Article IV consultation with Latvia will be conducted
in accordance with the decision on the consultation cycles for program countries.

1/ General government.
2/ Derived as [(r - (1+g - g + (1+r]/(1+g++g)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate;  = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;  = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and  = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as  (1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

1/ Derived as [r - g - (1+g) + (1+r)]/(1+g++g) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms, g = real GDP growth rate,
 = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and  = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-(1+g(1+r1+g++g) times previous period debt stock. increases with an appreciating domestic currency (> 0) and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels
of the last projection year.

Exchange Arrangements:
The currency of Latvia is the lats, which was introduced in March 1993 to replace the
Latvian ruble. The exchange rate was pegged to the SDR from February 1994 to
December 2004, within a ±1 percent band. On January 1, 2005, the lats was repegged to the
euro at the rate € 1 = 0.702804 lats, and on April 29, 2005, Latvia entered ERMII,
maintaining the previous band width. On June 30, 2010 the lats was equal to US$1.75.
Latvia’s exchange system is free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for
current international transactions. Latvia maintains security-related exchange restrictions
pursuant to UN Security Council resolutions and EC Council regulations, which have been

3
notified to the Fund under Decision No. 144-(52/51), adopted August 14, 1952. Latvia also
maintains a partial deposit freeze on Parex Bank, which gives rise to an exchange restriction.
However, as it has been imposed for balance of payments reasons, is temporary and is
nondiscriminatory, the Board has approved its retention until end-December 2010.
Article IV Consultation:
Latvia is on the 24-month consultation cycle.
The 2006 Article IV staff report was issued on September 13, 2006 (Country
Report No. 06/353). The last Article IV Board discussion took place on October 4, 2006.
The Public Information Notice No. 06/113 was released on October 12, 2006.
Safeguards Assessment:
The safeguards assessment completed on July 8, 2009 concluded that the BoL operates
robust internal audit and control systems. The assessment recommended clarifying the BoL
and Treasury’s respective roles in holding, managing, and reporting to the Fund audited
international reserves data. It also recommended amendments to the mandate of the BoL’s
audit committee and improvements to the financial statements' disclosures. The authorities
have already taken steps to implement some of these recommendations, notably by
establishing a formal arrangement between the BoL and Treasury, revising the audit
committee charter, and expanding the existing accounting framework.
FSAP Participation and ROSCs:
A joint World Bank-International Monetary Fund mission conducted an assessment of
Latvia’s financial sector as part of the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) during
February 14–28, 2001. The Financial Sector Stability Assessment (FSSA) report was
discussed at the Board on January 18, 2002, together with the 2001 Article IV staff report
(Country Report No. 02/10). An AML/CFT assessment mission took place during
March 8-24, 2006, and the report was sent to the Board on May 23, 2007. A joint IMF-World
Bank mission conducted an FSAP Update during February 27–March 9, 2007.

APPENDIX II. LATVIA: STATISTICAL ISSUES
LATVIA—STATISTICAL ISSUES APPENDIX
As of June 22, 2010
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision to the Fund is adequate for surveillance purposes.
A data ROSC report published in June 2004 found that the national accounts, the consumer and producer
price indices, government finance statistics (GFS), monetary and balance of payments statistics
generally follow internationally accepted guidelines on concepts and definitions, scope, classification
and sectorization, basis of recording, and valuation. The ROSC report pointed to the following areas to
be strengthened: (a) the consumer price index (CPI) excludes the services of owner-occupied dwellings;
(b) the Ministry of Finance should adopt the accrual standards of the Government Finance Statistics
Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001) for expenditures and include all income and expenditure of the general
government sector within the Treasury accounting and statistical system; (c) monetary statistics should
provide for greater detail in the classification of the liabilities of depository corporations by subsectors
of the general government. Moreover, there are discrepancies between the GDP estimates based on
production and those based on expenditure, provisions for expected losses of foreign-owned banks are
recorded in the balance of payments as a negative outflow, and cash data in the 2009 GFS Yearbook are
provided up to 2008.
National Accounts: The CSB compiles and publishes quarterly national accounts using the production
and expenditure approaches on a regular and timely basis, largely following the 1993 System of National
Accounts (SNA 1993) and the 1995 European System of Accounts (ESA 95). However, there are
significant discrepancies between the GDP estimates based on production and those based on
expenditure. The underlying data for the production approach are obtained primarily through a
comprehensive survey of businesses and individuals, and are supplemented by data from labor force
surveys and administrative sources. The CSB believes that the basic data understate economic activity,
particularly in the private sector, and there is an ongoing effort to increase coverage. Meanwhile, official
national accounts include an adjustment for under-recording. Additional data for the expenditure-based
accounts are obtained from household budget surveys and other surveys from the State Treasury and
ministries.
Government finance statistics: The Fund staff is provided with monthly information on revenues,
expenditures, and financing of the central and local governments and special budgets. With some
limitations, the available information permits the compilation of consolidated accounts of the general
government. The 2009 Government Finance Statistics Yearbook contains cash data in the GFSM 2001
format up to 2008. Monthly central government and quarterly general government data are provided on a
timely basis for International Financial Statistics.
Monetary statistics: Monetary statistics should provide for greater detail in the classification of the
liabilities of depository corporations by subsectors of the general government in line with international
standards.

This supplement provides additional information that has become available
since circulation of the staff reports (SM/10/180 and EBS/10/138). It does not alter the
thrust of the staff appraisals.
2.
Recent indicators continue to suggest that the economy is bottoming out.
Industrial production increased 13.3 percent year-on-year in May, while exports grew
35 percent. Imports are picking up too, rising 6 percent month-on-month and 11 percent since
December. Registered unemployment fell to 15.7 percent in June, but the labor force survey
measure remains at around 20 percent. Although year-on-year inflation still remains negative
at -1.6 percent, prices have started to increase, with monthly core and overall HICP inflation
of +0.4 percent in June.

The end-June performance criteria on net international reserves net domestic

Preliminary data suggest the end-June fiscal targets are likely to be met. While
final outturns for the general government and for relevant adjustors will not be available until
after the Board meeting, the central government fiscal deficit for June (2 percent of GDP
versus a program projection of 3.1 percent) is consistent with the target having been met.
Revenues have been a little stronger and net lending somewhat lower than assumed in the
budget.
5.

Progress has been mixed on structural benchmarks related to fiscal policy:



The authorities met the benchmark on preparing a draft fiscal responsibility
law, but important revisions should be made before the law is submitted. These
include using a rolling three-year medium-term budgetary framework for the
spending rule (rather than fixing expenditure ceilings four years ahead without scope
for revision), and modifying the deficit rule to allow scope for more countercyclical
fiscal policies while respecting the Stability and Growth Pact.



The authorities have met the benchmark on pension reform by producing a
strategy paper that offers a number of possible reforms to the pension system that
would achieve cost savings and ensure the system’s sustainability.



However, the benchmark on conducting a review of welfare benefits seems only
to have been partially met. While full details are not yet available, the review seems
only to identify one possible reform: making permanent the cut in maternity and
paternity benefits to 80 percent of wages (from 100 percent in 2009). However, there
is no intention to make permanent the other 2010 measures (e.g., reducing by
50 percent benefits that exceed L11.5 per day, including for unemployment and
parental benefits (care of the child in her first year)), and no identification of savings
to pay for this additional cost.

6.
A parliamentary committee is considering delaying the introduction of a natural
gas excise tax from July 2010 to January 2014, given the likely increase in heating prices
next winter. Although the full year cost is limited (just under 0.1 percent of GDP), this would
be inconsistent with an LOI commitment to avoid tax cuts in 2010, though this year’s deficit
target would still be met.
7.
On July 15 the Bank of Latvia announced that it will lower rates on its deposit
facility, cutting the 7-day rate from 1 percent to 0.5 percent and the overnight rate from
0.5 percent to 0.375 percent. The changes will take effect on July 23. The Bank of Latvia
believes this cut will help stimulate lending.
8.
The President’s veto has prompted improvements to proposed amendments to
the insolvency law concerning household debtors (EBS/10/138, ¶23). The latest proposal
would limit the use of an income-based repayment scheme to obtain a discharge from the
remaining debt to natural persons with either relatively small debts (of up to L100,000) or

3
very limited repayment capacity. Those with larger debts or better repayment capacity would
not be able to make use of this type of scheme, and would have to pay a proportion of their
debt (e.g., 50 percent or 35 percent), after liquidation of their non-exempt assets, before
being discharged from the remaining debt. A final vote by Parliament is not expected until
after the Board meeting, but it seems that stakeholders broadly accept this compromise
proposal, which should allow for other improvements to the insolvency law to go through.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2010 Article IV Consultation and
Third Review of the Stand-By Arrangement with the Republic of
Latvia
On July 21, 2010, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the 2010 Article IV consultation with the Republic of Latvia and completed the
Third Review of the country’s performance under an economic program supported by a
Stand-By Arrangement (SBA).1 Completion of the review makes available an amount
equivalent to SDR 90 million (about €105.8 million or US$135.6 million), bringing total
disbursements under the SBA to SDR 982 million (about €1.15 billion or
US$1.48 billion).
Background
Latvia’s economy grew extremely rapidly for a number of years through 2007. Capital
inflows, including from foreign parent banks, and expansionary macroeconomic policies
pushed up growth, but also fueled unsustainable credit and housing bubbles, as well as
a current account deficit above 20 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). The
combination of these bubbles unwinding, the global financial crisis, and acute banking
pressures in Latvia contributed to a crisis in late 2008 and eventually to an 18 percent
output contraction in 2009—the largest in the world. In November 2008, with deposit
withdrawals putting pressure on international reserves and the fiscal position

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings
up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

deteriorating due to a steep drop in revenue as well as mounting banking costs, Latvia
approached the Fund and European Commission for emergency financial support.
Strengthened policy implementation since mid-2009, including sizeable fiscal
adjustment, as well as financial and policy support from international program partners
have helped stabilize Latvia’s economy and restore a measure of balance after the
crisis. Domestic interest rates and external measures of risk have both come down
dramatically since 2009. Deposits, which fell sharply early in the crisis, have returned to
near pre-crisis levels, which along with a sharp improvement in the current account and
international support have boosted foreign exchange reserves and restored confidence
in Latvia’s exchange rate peg. While the country’s contraction has been especially
steep, falling prices and wages have gone a long way toward addressing previous
competitiveness problems. Policy actions in the past year have also helped insulate
Latvia to a degree from recent turbulence in Western Europe
Latvia’s economy appears to be bottoming out with positive annual growth expected to
return in 2011. However, growth is forecast to remain well below pre-crisis levels in the
medium term, and Latvia faces a number of challenges to entrench stability, raise
growth, and meet the Maastricht criteria for euro adoption as quickly as possible—a key
goal of the government. These challenges include: reducing very high unemployment,
including by facilitating a shift toward the tradable sector; undertaking substantial
additional fiscal adjustment; ensuring that competitiveness is restored and maintained;
and resolving a large private sector debt overhang that will inhibit growth.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for undertaking difficult fiscal and
financial sector reforms, which have helped stabilize the economy and contributed to a
rebound after last year’s deep recession. Although near-term vulnerabilities have
declined substantially, the recovery is still fragile and significant medium-term
challenges remain toward the goal of euro adoption. Directors underscored the
importance of sustained fiscal adjustment, restoration of financial sector health, and
continued structural reforms aimed at reorienting growth toward the tradable sector,
boosting employment and competitiveness, and improving the business environment.
Directors emphasized that considerable fiscal adjustment is still needed, especially on
the expenditure side, to preserve debt sustainability and lower the deficit in line with the
Maastricht criteria. They encouraged the authorities to focus on high-quality measures
and durable spending cuts, including by re-examining areas where spending had
increased significantly in the past, and to improve control over state-owned enterprises.
Given the required size of the adjustment, Directors welcomed the authorities’ mediumterm tax strategy, which identifies possible revenue measures, as well as the plans to
tackle the gray economy. They supported efforts to improve budget practices and
promote counter-cyclical policies, including through the planned fiscal responsibility law.
Strengthening the authority of the Ministry of Finance would help improve policy
formulation and implementation. It would also be important to maintain fiscal discipline
and avoid further deviation from the consolidation strategy through the coming election
period. Preparation of a menu of options would help achieve needed savings in the
2011 budget.

3

Directors welcomed the substantial improvement in competitiveness since early 2009,
attributable in part to the marked decline in unit labor costs. Additional wage and price
adjustment, together with structural reforms, would help close any remaining
competitiveness gap, further enhance confidence in the quasi-currency board exchange
rate regime, and reorient the economy toward the export sector.
Directors commended efforts to address Latvia’s high unemployment rate, notably a
successful public works program. They encouraged further reforms to enhance
productivity, a lower tax wedge on labor, and measures to address skill shortages and
mismatches through training and vocational education.
Directors welcomed the progress in strengthening financial sector regulation and
supervision, bank resolution procedures, and credit and liquidity risk management rules.
They emphasized the need to ensure that banks fully comply with regulations and
maintain adequate provisioning against nonperforming loans. Given high levels of
private sector debt, further steps would also be needed to facilitate market-based debt
restructuring, streamline insolvency and foreclosure procedures and reduce costs, and
address tax disincentives. Directors called for rapid action to restructure the two stateowned banks, including preparation of a restructuring plan for Mortgage and Land Bank.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
