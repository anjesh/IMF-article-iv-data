STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
April 18, 2014

KEY ISSUES
Context. With a strong policy framework, Luxembourg has weathered the crisis well, and
the economy is rebounding. The fiscal position remains sound, and the large financial
sector has been resilient. But trend growth has slowed substantially. The financial sector
will have to adjust to a changing external landscape, public finances will come under
strain from losses in e-VAT revenue and strong expenditure growth, and Luxembourg’s
cost competitiveness is being eroded. A new government took office in December 2013.
Fiscal policy. A moderate but sustained fiscal consolidation is essential to preserve the
current healthy fiscal position, stabilize debt below 30 percent of GDP—a commitment
of the new government—and strongly anchor the AAA rating. Given current low rates,
the planned VAT hike is appropriate, and consideration should be given to increasing
the yield of property taxes. But even after implementing revenue measures, it will remain
critical to curb public spending growth; the expenditure review underway will be a useful
tool to identify savings. A thorough assessment of social benefits should receive special
focus and would also help boost growth potential through greater labor participation.
Financial sector policy. Banks’ capitalization and liquidity remain high, the investment
fund industry continues to grow, and financial sector oversight has been strengthened.
Faced with lower growth in euro area activities, and the switch to automatic exchange of
information, banks are diversifying businesses and retooling private banking activities.
The decision to front-load the implementation of Basel III capital requirements will help
safeguard the resilience of the financial sector. But consideration should be given to
supplement it with additional measures for systemic banks over time and within the
European framework. Supervisors need to continue to closely monitor domestic real
estate exposures, interconnections in the domestic financial sector and new emerging
risks from financial diversification.
Structural policies. Despite a strong external position, the country might be pricing
itself out of some activities, following substantial labor cost increases since the crisis. The
expiration of the temporary agreement on wage indexation offers an opportunity to
adjust the mechanism in a way that better aligns wages and productivity movements.
Measures to strengthen labor skills and the business environment would further support
the authorities’ strategy to diversify beyond the financial sector.

RESILIENT SO FAR, BUT CHALLENGES LOOMING

2.
But trend growth has slowed markedly from the
pre-crisis period. The period of buoyant pre-crisis
activity—with average growth of 4¾ percent over 2000–08,
driven by rapidly expanding financial services—has come
to an end. The ongoing changes in the EU financial
landscape will call for adjustment. Meanwhile, labor costs
have risen substantially more than in trade partners, and
underlying productivity has been dented by the crisis
(Figure 3). As a consequence, potential growth is estimated
to have been cut to half the pre-crisis period, at about 2–
2¼ percent.

Thanks to sound policy management, Luxembourg has weathered the crisis well. After
a shallow recession in 2012, growth reached 2.1 percent in 2013—the second best performance in

While the external position remains strong, the economy faces several challenges from
an evolving external environment. The current account surplus reached 5.2 percent of GDP
in 2013, and the exchange rate is estimated to be broadly in line with fundamentals (Appendix I).
However, Luxembourg’s role as a hub for EMU financial activities ties its fortunes intrinsically to the
euro area (Box 1 and Figure 4). Deleveraging trends, EU-driven regulatory changes, and the global
move toward higher transparency of cross-border financial flows will weigh on the banking sector.
Large and volatile capital flows are dominated by cross-border banking and investment fund
activities with limited linkages to domestic activity, but their sheer size in comparison to the
economy could still generate inward spillovers in case of systemic shocks.
4.
Luxembourg’s fiscal position is healthy, but there are looming challenges there too.
The fiscal position is characterized by a structural surplus and very low general government debt
(23 percent of GDP in 2013), and Luxembourg remains one of the few AAA-rated sovereigns in the
region. However, the fiscal position will come under strain from upcoming losses in e-VAT revenue,
and rapidly growing public expenditures. The G20-driven push to increase transparency in corporate
taxation could also affect Luxembourg, as it hosts large multinational activities.

Box 1. Luxembourg’s Financial Sector
Luxembourg hosts a large financial sector mostly
focused on cross-border businesses. It hosts the
second largest fund industry after the U.S., a large
banking sector (15 times GDP) with diversified
activities, and one of the largest primary markets for
international bond issuance. A wide spectrum of
specialized financial service providers gravitate around
the industry, with support ranging from legal to
accounting and IT activities. In 2012, the sector
contributed 22 percent of GDP and 11 percent of
employment.

The banking sector is dominated by subsidiaries
and branches of foreign groups. These conduct mostly cross-border businesses, including wealth
management, intragroup treasury and liquidity management, custody services to investment funds, and
international wholesale lending. Unlike other countries with a large financial sector, the system is a net
provider of liquidity, and overall non–resident deposits have remained stable, even after the move to
automatic exchange of information for tax purposes was announced in April 2013. Only a handful of banks—
less than 20 percent of total banking assets but about 250 percent of GDP—provide credit to the economy,
with generally limited links with the internationally-oriented sector. Half of these domestically-oriented
banks are stand-alone domestic banking groups, the rest are owned by European banking groups.
The investment fund industry manages assets amounting to 2.6 trillion euro. The industry benefits from
the established trademark and passporting features of UCITS (Undertaking for Collective Investment on
Transferable Securities) products, and caters to a diversified pool of non-resident investors. After a marginal
decline in May 2013 in the context of global volatility, assets under management have resumed their
increase. UCITS funds for retail distribution under EU regulation continue to dominate, with around
80 percent of assets. Money market fund activities have been curtailed in the wake of the crisis, and constant
net asset value (CNAV) funds, which generated substantial liquidity pressures in 2009, account for only
5 percent of total fund assets. A large part of the investment funds’ products are sold outside of the euro
area, but similarly, a substantial part of the funds are invested in assets from non-euro area countries.
In synergy with those activities, the financial sector is also involved in bond issuance, and custodian
and settlement activities. Luxembourg is one of the biggest international bond issuance markets in the
world. It hosts an important global clearing and settlement player focusing on euro-denominated bonds. It
is also home to various other financial services. The insurance sector is relatively large and growing, with
total assets over 5 times GDP.
The country’s business model benefits from several key comparative advantages:

Stable political and economic conditions, as exemplified by the AAA sovereign rating, a central
location within the euro area and a multi-lingual society.

A first-mover advantage, as the country’s financial center status was originally built on European
banks’ foreign exchange and euro loan businesses that were attracted by flexible regulations. The authorities
have generally been proactive in implementing new European regulations.

EU and euro area financial integration, in particular the European passport for financial
intermediaries and single rulebooks for financial regulation, such as UCITS.

Despite an inclusive social model, the labor market is showing some signs of strain,
and the housing market is posing multi-dimensional challenges. Unemployment has doubled
since the early 2000s to reach 7 percent, even though employment has increased steadily, including
during the crisis. Rapid pre-crisis growth allowed for a well-developed safety net and substantial
income redistribution, but generous social benefits also tend to generate inactivity traps. The
temporary adjustment to automatic wage indexation—limiting it to one tranche every twelve
months—has mitigated the steady erosion in cost competitiveness, but the agreement expires at the
end of 2014. Meanwhile, rapid income and population growth is feeding demand for residential real
estate, while structural supply shortages persist (Box 2).
Box 2. Housing Market Challenges1
House prices picked up strongly in 2013, by almost 9 percent, following a longer period of moderate but
sustained growth between 2003 and 2011, and a slight decline in 2012.
Cyclical as well as structural factors are contributing to the imbalance between demand and supply.



Continuing population and employment growth, as well as a very large group of non-resident
workers (around 40 percent of employment) are pushing up structural demand.



With mortgage interest rates at record lows, accommodative financial conditions provide further
impetus to demand, while government policies (i.e. interest subsidies, tax deductibility of mortgage
loan interest payments, and other assistance) strengthen incentives for home ownership.



Meanwhile, supply is held back by constraints on building, including through environmental and
zoning rules. Low recurrent taxation on immovable property is keeping the opportunity cost of
holding unused land or property low, especially in a context of expectations of continuous price
increases, further reducing turnover.

Domestically-oriented banks’ exposure to Luxembourg’s real estate market has risen significantly.
Mortgage credit never slowed during the crisis, even as credit to non-financial corporates fell sharply. As a
consequence, mortgage credit has risen from 12 percent of domestically oriented banks’ assets in 2008 to
24 percent in 2012, or almost 50 percent of GDP.
Households’ financial position is strong, though with pockets of vulnerability. Household debt to GDP
is around 55 percent, and households are among the wealthiest in the region. However, much of the wealth
is held in real estate, and therefore sensitive to valuation changes. With most loans at floating interest rates,
increases in interest rates, as well as higher unemployment, could pose risks for households with a more
fragile financial position.

OUTLOOK, RISKS, AND SPILLOVERS
6.
The outlook is for growth to firm up, but falling well short of the pre-crisis trend.
Growth is forecast to reach 2 to 2½ percent over 2014–19, broadly in line with potential (Table 1). A
more conducive regional outlook will support trade and investment. The financial sector will
continue to contribute to growth, but at a slower pace than pre-crisis, as banks retool and reorient
their activities toward new businesses.
7.

Short to medium-term risks are tilted to the downside (see Table 2).



On the external side, a protracted period of low growth in the euro area could hold back the
recovery in the Grand Duchy, given its strong trade and financial linkages with the region.



On the domestic side, failure to address forthcoming losses in revenue and strong spending
growth would sharply worsen the fiscal position. As this would lead to a steady increase in
public debt, investors could eventually come to doubt the stability of Luxembourg’s AAA rating,
a critical requirement for the financial sector’s attractiveness.

8.
Longer-term risks pertain to the capacity to secure Luxembourg’s business model in a
changing environment and to the prevalence of a large financial sector.


The baseline scenario assumes that the banking sector successfully reorients its activities toward
more dynamic regions—as the euro area banking sector continues to deleverage—and higher
net-worth individuals—as the move to automatic exchange of information for tax purposes
reduces private banking geared to less affluent non-resident clients. An overriding risk, however,
is that these adjustments have a larger-than-expected impact, with knock-on effects on growth,
employment, and public finances.



Rising residential real estate exposures could also pose a risk in the (still low-probability) event
of a sharp correction in housing prices. The three largest mortgage lenders are sizeable relative
to the economy and support to any of these banks would add significantly to public debt. A few
of these banks also remain subsidiaries of large European banks, posing a risk of contagion as
happened with Dexia.

9.
Luxembourg is a recipient of inward spillovers and a conduit for outward spillovers,
rather than a generator of spillovers in its own capacity. Internationally-oriented banks represent
about 80 percent of assets. In the event of a systemic shock in one of the large euro area parent
banks, the treatment of intragroup exposures in any bail-in decisions will be critical, given that such
exposures account for half of the sector’s assets. The 2.6 trillion euros managed by the fund industry
are almost entirely invested in foreign assets. Thus, both inward and outward potential spillovers
from a surge in global financial market volatility could be large—for example arising from the
unwinding of unconventional monetary policies in the United States. The unwinding could affect the
portfolio allocation of investment funds, but with likely limited effect on the domestic economy. Yet,
the reallocation, if sizeable, could affect a wide range of countries in which these funds are invested.

Authorities’ views. The authorities concurred that growth would not return to pre-crisis
levels, but viewed short-term growth prospects slightly better than staff, on the basis of a more
negative output gap. However, there was agreement that the measure of the output gap was
surrounded with high uncertainty, given the small size of the economy and the ongoing adjustment
in the financial sector (Box 3). They also saw risks more balanced, as they were optimistic that the
financial sector would come out stronger from the regulatory changes implemented at the EU level
and from the move toward greater transparency. Conversely, they viewed continued financial
fragmentation within the euro area as a significant risk factor exacerbating the impact of regulatory
changes in Europe and hence for financial activities in Luxembourg.

2¾ percent.
The wide range of estimates illustrates the need for a conservative approach, as revisions to the data tend to
reduce the size of the output gap over time. Going forward, staff’s medium term projections assume a very
gradual recovery in potential growth, given headwinds to growth from the various challenges, and a slow
pick-up in TFP reflecting diversification efforts. The output gap is projected to broadly close by 2016.

POLICY PRIORITIES TO SECURE LUXEMBOURG'S
ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL MODEL
Luxembourg’s success has been predicated on a model of strong public finances, dynamic financial
services, and an attractive business environment. Together, these factors allowed for solid growth
prior to the crisis and the financing of a generous social welfare system. Discussions focused on
the priorities to preserve the main outlines of this model in a changing environment. Those
revolved around actions to preserve the healthy fiscal position, manage the risks associated with
the diversification of financial sector activities, and shore up competitiveness to ensure the
economy can also diversify beyond the financial sector.

A. Adapting Fiscal Policy
11.
Without corrective measures, the fiscal position would deteriorate substantially over
the next five years. While the 2014 fiscal stance is projected to be broadly neutral, under
unchanged policies the structural deficit is projected to worsen by as much as 3½ percent of GDP
over 2015–2019. The deterioration would be driven broadly equally by the loss in e-VAT revenues
and continued buoyant expenditure growth—which has outpaced that of revenue and GDP
since 2009.1 Public debt could reach close to 40 percent of GDP by 2019, substantially higher than
the new government’s target (Figure 5, Tables 3 and 4).
12.
Staff advocated a moderate but sustained consolidation effort for the next five years.
An annual effort of around ½ percent of GDP in structural terms (excluding the effect of e-VAT
losses) over 2015–2019 would stabilize debt below 30 percent of GDP—an explicit commitment of
the coalition partners. It would also allow Luxembourg to return to its medium-term objective of
½ percent of GDP structural surplus by 2018—a European commitment—while mitigating the
negative impact on growth (Figure 6, Table 5).
13.
The authorities have announced a VAT hike, as a first measure. The measure is expected
to be adopted by Parliament in the second half of the year, with rate increases to take effect in
January 2015, and an estimated yield of ¾ percent of GDP. Staff supported this move, noting that,
given low current rates, the planned 2 percentage point hike would still allow Luxembourg to
maintain the lowest VAT rate in the EU. The increase would apply to all rates but the lowest
3 percent rate on basic goods, helping to shield the poorest households.

Based on the E-Business Directives, from 2015, VAT on digital content will be charged where the customer resides,
not to the country of origin. 70 percent of the revenue (1½ percent of GDP) will be lost starting in 2015, an additional
15 percent in 2017, and the full amount in 2019.

1/ Excludes the effect of eVAT losses, as those do not represent a fiscal stimulus to the domestic economy, despite the fact
that without correction, they would appear as a relaxation of the fiscal stance.
2/ Under the assumptions of measures including (i) VAT adjustment totalling ¾ percent of GDP, spread over 2015-2016 (ii)
increase in recurrent property taxes yielding ¾ percent of GDP spread over 2015-17, and (iii) moderation in expenditure growth
in social benefits, purchases of goods and services, wages and salaries, current transfers, and subsidies of 2½ percent of GDP.
Total current expenditures would be assumed to grow by 1¾ percent per year on average in real terms as opposed to 3½
percent, over 2015-19.

14.
Property taxes would be another preferred source of revenue. Luxembourg’s income
from such taxes is currently less than 0.1 percent of GDP, while it averages ¾ percent of GDP in the
euro area. Increasing the tax yield could take the form of an update in property valuations—which
date back to 1941 and are out of line with current market prices. Raising revenue through this
channel would also increase the holding costs of unused properties, potentially relieving pressures
in the housing market.
15.
However, staff stressed that significant steps were also required to curtail rapid
expenditure growth:


Staff welcomed the recently-initiated comprehensive expenditure review as a tool to prioritize
savings to be included in the 2015 budget. As part of EU commitments, the planned
introduction of multi-annual budgeting and expenditure ceilings for the central government
could also help identify efficiency gains. A public sector reform bill which includes a wage
agreement for 2014–16 is expected to generate short-term costs but will allow for a slowdown
in the seniority system. Staff noted that, over the medium term, public sector staffing and
compensation policies would need to be consistent with the new budgetary framework.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

LUXEMBOURG



Staff stressed that a specific area of focus should be social benefits, as they absorb about half of
public spending, are the highest per capita in the region, and some of them create disincentives
to work (Box 4). Consideration could also be given to partially means-testing family benefits.

16.
Pension reforms remain an unfinished agenda. Despite the steps taken in 2012, without
deeper reforms, pension obligations are still expected to remain unsustainable in the long term.
Staff encouraged the authorities to consider measures well ahead of the 2017 scheduled review,
including by permanently limiting indexation of pensions to inflation only.
17.
The fiscal framework is to be adjusted to fulfill EU commitments and prepare for
potential changes in international corporate taxation. A fiscal council to monitor deviations from
fiscal targets is to be constituted. With the main fiscal target now defined in structural terms, staff
underlined the importance of estimating output gaps conservatively, to avoid overstating the
structural balance. The extent to which the global push for transparency in corporate taxation would
affect revenues in Luxembourg is difficult to determine, as data is patchy; staff encouraged the
authorities to develop a better capacity to assess tax revenues stemming from multinational
activities.
Authorities’ views
18.
The authorities are keenly aware of the fiscal challenge, and plan to achieve
consolidation mainly by slowing expenditure growth. They underscored that efforts had already
started in 2014, with a limit on expenditure growth at the central government level, and that the VAT
increase was also to come. They expressed a preference for front-loading measures in 2015, the year
the revenue loss would materialize, stressed the role of the ongoing expenditure review, and took
note of the recommendation on property taxes. They agreed that social benefits selectivity would
need to increase—it is part of the coalition agreement—but noted, however, that reforms in that
area might take longer to implement. While they recognized that more needed to be done to
reform the pension system, they did not foresee any measures in the near term.
19.
The authorities also planned a strategic review of both tax and expenditure policies to
provide the basis for reforms. On the revenue side, a committee of experts will be established to
conduct a comprehensive review of the tax system, in particular with a view to improving efficiency
while maintaining tax competitiveness. Measures would be expected in 2017. On the expenditure
side, the authorities noted that a move to a more flexible system, whereby public servants could be
moved from one area to another more easily, would help respond to evolving needs. With respect
to international corporate taxation, the authorities reiterated that, as long as a level playing field was
established at a global level, they would favor those reforms.

Box 4. Inactivity Traps in Luxembourg1
Incentives embedded in the social benefits system can give rise to “inactivity traps”. These operate
when people taking up employment are financially worse off, because the additional net income from work
is less than the social benefits foregone in the process, either from unemployment benefits and/or from
other social assistance, deterring those affected from participating in economic activity. In those
circumstances, the marginal effective tax rate (METR) exceeds 100 percent: more than 100 percent of the
additional income is “taxed away”. These effects tend to be observed mostly at the low end of the wage
scale.
The social benefit system in Luxembourg exhibits some of these features. Unemployment benefits are
relatively generous, with an 80 percent replacement rate, for a maximum of 12 months. Those ineligible for
unemployment benefits can access the minimum guaranteed income (RMG), with amounts received varying
by family status and by income up to a certain level. The RMG also includes a small housing benefit portion.
Other relevant benefits include family benefits, which are not means-tested, a cost-of-living type allowance
(“allocation de vie chère”), and a minimal income tax credit for work.
This system results in very high METRs, particularly for those receiving unemployment benefits, for
whom virtually all the additional income is taxed away when taking up employment. This effect is present up
to relatively high wage income and across family status ranging from single persons to single earner couples
and two-earner couples, with or without children. For example, the METR only declines below 100 percent
levels at 90 percent of average wage for a single person, and at as high as 150 percent of average wage for
the second earner of a two-earner couple.
In the case of the RMG, the inactivity trap effect operates at lower wage ranges than with
unemployment benefits, but still applies to many types of family status. The METR is above 100 percent
for singles earning below 50 percent of the average

Policies should focus on incentives to participate
in economic activity. While the social benefit system has helped support social cohesion, it is likely to have
contributed to the high rate of unemployment for unskilled workers, and to a less dynamic economy
through lower participation rates. The authorities have revamped the employment agency to more actively
tackle this challenge. Experiences in neighboring countries such as Germany suggest indeed that more
active labor market policies help, but they also highlight the need to combine them with a reform of social
benefits to address the adverse incentives related to high METR. In that respect, a reduction in social
transfers could be associated with the introduction of a well-targeted earned income tax credit system.

B. Navigating the Changing Financial Landscape
20.
The European regulatory and supervisory environment is undergoing substantial
changes. As the euro area moves toward a banking union, banks and supervisors will have to
prepare for the switch to the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM). The single rulebook is being
enhanced through the transposition of Basel III framework, and harmonization of banks’ recovery
and resolution processes as well as of national deposit guarantee schemes. In parallel, the
authorities announced that they will start the automatic exchange of information with other tax
authorities under the EU Savings Taxation Directive on savings income from 2015.
21.
The financial sector appears resilient and, faced with these new challenges, is moving
toward diversification. 2 Despite a contraction of their balance sheets since the crisis—driven by
deleveraging pressures in euro area parent banks—banks remain highly capitalized and liquid, and
NPLs are low (Table 6). However, staff stressed that, with the euro area banking sector still ailing,
activities geared toward the region were likely to grow only moderately. Progress toward banking
union was seen as positive in the long run. But staff noted that strengthened capital requirements
and the introduction of bail-in instruments might initially exacerbate euro area deleveraging
pressures, and that more harmonized EU regulation and supervision might lessen Luxembourg’s
competitive advantage for some businesses. In that context, it was recognized that diversification
already underway would mitigate some of the short-term effects of EU-driven changes:


Luxembourg has been able to attract new institutions from emerging markets looking for a hub
in the euro area, in part thanks to its extensive financial infrastructure.



Banks are retooling private banking activities toward high net-worth individuals to mitigate the
effects of the switch to automatic exchange of information in 2015—which could be challenging
for some institutions.



The investment fund industry has continued expanding, despite recent bouts of volatility in
global financial markets. The rapid transposition of the Alternative Investment Fund Managers
Directive was seen as an opportunity to develop new activities.

22.
Financial sector oversight has been steadily improved. Since the 2011 FSAP, staffing at
the Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (CSSF) has been increased, techniques for stress
testing banks have been enhanced, and investor protection has been stepped up (Appendix III).
Cooperation between the Banque Centrale du Luxembourg (BCL) and the CSSF is being enhanced in
the context of the preparations for the SSM. It will be further strengthened through the foreseen
set-up of a national Systemic Risk Committee, involving the supervisors, the BCL, and the Finance
Ministry. Preparation for the SSM, though taxing on resources, is proceeding according to schedule,
with 80 percent of total assets expected to be supervised by the SSM, either directly or through

2

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

LUXEMBOURG

parent banks.3 Staff noted that the operational independence of the CSSF could be further
strengthened as part of the SSM-related revision of the legal framework.
23.
The authorities are also taking steps to preserve the resilience of the banking sector.
The implementation of Basel III capital requirements is being front-loaded, with banks having to
meet the minimum 7 percent CET1 from 2014. Given the already high level of capital, banks were
generally expected to meet this requirement without difficulty. Staff viewed the measure as
appropriate but encouraged the supervisors to remain vigilant and carefully monitor systemic banks
to determine, in collaboration with European authorities, whether specific additional measures might
be warranted over time. In parallel, each bank will be required to provision at least 1 percent of their
insured deposits by end-2016—the aggregate provisioning already exceeds 2 percent of insured
deposits. Work to transpose EU’s Deposit Guarantee Schemes and Bank Recovery and Resolution
Directives has started, and banks will be mandated to prepare resolution plans in this context.
Coordination with all parties involved, in the context of the future Single Supervision and Resolution
Mechanisms, would be critical in the event of a potential systemic shock in one of the large euro
area parent banks.
24.
Domestic residential real estate exposures require monitoring. Exposures have risen
substantially since 2008. The authorities have taken several positive steps, including by raising risk
weights for mortgage loans exceeding 80 percent of loan-to-value ratios and by requiring frequent
stress testing. While early indications suggest these measures are gaining traction, staff argued that
supervisors should stand ready to take additional macro-prudential measures if exposures
continued to rise. Given their systemic importance for the domestic economy, consideration could
also be given to maintaining higher capital requirements for domestically-oriented banks, in
collaboration with European authorities.
25.

Interconnections and emerging risks should be carefully scrutinized.



Staff underscored the need to closely monitor the entire financial sector. In particular, links
between the various domestic financial actors—for example, from large deposits in the banking
system from the fund industry, specialized financial service providers, financial holdings and via
financial infrastructures—warrant close monitoring, including of potential inward and outward
spillovers. The proposed Systemic Risk Committee would be well-placed to monitor these risks,
possibly through system-wide stress testing covering both investment funds and banks.



Staff stressed that diversification comes with both benefits and risks. In that context, emerging
risks should receive enhanced attention; for example, currency mismatch risks could increase as
banks’ business in foreign currencies expands. Staff encouraged the authorities to publish their
assessments regularly to show that they are closely following new developments in the sector.

3

Seven banks with head offices in Luxembourg, including two domestically-oriented banks, will be subject to the
comprehensive assessment directly. 62 other banks, including all other major domestically-oriented banks, will also
be subject to the exercise through their head offices in other euro area countries.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

LUXEMBOURG



Likewise, to maintain the confidence in the financial sector and ward off reputational risks, staff
called for more communication on the authorities’ commitment to investor and depositor
protection.



Staff pointed to remaining shortcomings in the AML/CFT and tax information exchange
frameworks to be addressed. While the Financial Action Task Force recently recognized efforts in
addressing some of the shortcomings under the 2003 AML/CFT standard, further progress is
needed in relation to the treatment of tax offences, transparency of legal persons and
arrangements, and exchange of information with foreign counterparts (Appendix IV).

Authorities’ views
26.
The authorities and industry were optimistic about the financial center’s prospects
under the changing environment. They saw the financial industry capable of adapting to more
transparency and to upcoming EU-driven regulatory changes. They noted that these trends, which
they called for, could even have upside risks as they could strengthen the financial center’s
advantages. They pointed in particular to the “eco-system” developed over time in Luxembourg as a
powerful selling point to attract new businesses—a unique concentration of diversified financial
institutions and related services, providing services based on the EU rulebook and the civil law
tradition, and supported by the multi-lingual workforce. They were also positive about the move
toward a euro area banking union, as it would ensure a level playing field and contribute to the
stability of the European banking system. The comprehensive assessment by the ECB was not seen
as likely to raise any substantial issue as the authorities viewed banks as well capitalized and with
limited exposures to risky assets. They emphasized that the national supervisors would continue to
work closely with the SSM after its establishment, as envisaged in related regulations.
27.
Supervisors stressed, though, the importance of moving in collaboration with
European partners. They were open to consider additional capital buffers for systemic and
domestically-oriented banks. They noted, however, that these measures would have to be carried
out over time and in consultation with EU partners—once the full picture of CRD IV implementation
became clearer in the euro area. The authorities explained their plan to move ahead expeditiously to
set up an ex-ante deposit guarantee scheme and saw merit in maintaining the current overall level
of protection even as they moved to this ex-ante system.
28.
The authorities broadly shared staff’s views on possible sources of risks for the
financial sector. They agreed on the need to closely monitor banks’ residential real estate exposure
and to consider further measures if need be, but preferred for now to wait for the full effects of
recent measures. They concurred on the need to continuously monitor risks arising from growing
interconnections within the financial sector and from diversification efforts, but at this point, did not
see those links posing a substantial risk to the sector’s stability. The authorities agreed with the need
to communicate more proactively their focus on investor protection. Finally, the authorities indicated
that they are waiting for the adoption of the 4th AML/CFT Directive to revise their legal framework in
line with international and regional standards, but that they had already taken preparatory steps
with regard to tax crimes and the transparency of legal persons and arrangements.

C. Supporting Economic Diversification beyond the Financial Sector
29.
The authorities are implementing a diversification strategy beyond financial activities.
They have been targeting specific sectors of growth (i.e. logistics, ICT, bio- and eco-technologies),
and efforts are starting to bear fruit, in particular in the fledging but rapidly growing ICT sector.
30.
However, despite a strong external position, underlying trends are less benign. Wages
have continued to increase rapidly, even after the crisis, and this despite a decline in productivity
and slower employment growth. As a result, the increase in unit labor costs has outpaced that in
euro area neighbors by about 20 percent since 2007. The automatic wage indexation mechanism
played a critical role, making it difficult for wages to adjust to declining productivity since the crisis;
staff analysis suggests that it contributed to more than half of the persistent wedge between
Luxembourg and euro area inflation (Box 5). Despite strong economic performance in pre-crisis
years, and a solid external position, structural problems in the labor market, as exemplified by the
continuous increase in long term unemployment and skills mismatch at the lower end of the wage
scale, could eventually erode competitiveness, and hamper long-term growth potential.
31.
Adjusting the wage indexation mechanism would help halt these trends. Under a
temporary agreement expiring in December 2014, efforts to alleviate the negative side-effects of
indexation—by limiting wage adjustments to once a year—have helped contain unit labor costs. But
staff underscored the need for further actions to better link wage and productivity developments,
and suggested some complementary options:


Making the limit of one indexation round per year a permanent feature after the current
arrangement expires, but setting the annual cap closer to the ECB price stability objective (close
but below 2 percent) than the current 2½ percent threshold, with additional wage increases left
to negotiations between employers and employees to reflect productivity developments.



Supplementing the current mechanism with escape clauses when inflation among the main trade
partners falls significantly below the annual cap on automatic indexation.



Modifying the reference index to exclude volatile prices (notably food and fuel prices).

one of the highest among advanced economies.

An econometric analysis suggests that at least half of the inflation differential with the euro area can
be attributed to the automatic indexation mechanism. In a model linking Luxembourg inflation to the
euro area inflation and idiosyncratic effects such as the automatic indexation and the review of minimum
wages, the latter effects are found to contribute ½ to 1 percentage point to the annual inflation rate. Spikes
in inflation are found to occur the quarter directly following an episode of automatic wage indexation. In this
context, the temporary arrangements in place until end–2014 limiting the frequency of adjustment has
helped, but a permanent system less conducive to high inflation persistence should be designed to preserve
competitiveness. This is especially important in a context where the increase in labor compensation has been
accompanied by a decline in labor productivity since the crisis.

Steps to increase labor participation, strengthen labor skills and reinforce the business
environment would further support diversification efforts. Staff pointed to the need to:


Review social benefits to strengthen work incentives. The 2012 pension reform increased the
number of contribution years required for full pension, but did not touch existing early
retirement schemes that result in a low effective retirement age. The recent reform of the
employment agency (ADEM) improved job search assistance and training opportunities. But staff
argued that a review of existing social transfers, including unemployment insurance benefits and
minimum guaranteed revenue, would complement these efforts by increasing incentives to
participate in the labor market.



Continue efforts to align skills to private sector needs. Growing skill mismatches at the low end of
the wage scale suggest a need to review some features of the education system—where
Luxembourg ranks low compared to OECD peers—with a view to reducing dropout rates and
increasing efficiency. In addition, efforts should continue to be made to match workers’ skills
with private sector needs, in collaboration with the private sector, including through support for
training in the areas of targeted growth.



Reduce barriers to entry and competition. As noted by the OECD, Luxembourg has more stringent
product market regulations than other EU members, notably for professional services and
network industries (i.e. retail distribution). In addition, the emergence of new firms could be
facilitated by improving administrative processes to start a business.

Authorities’ views. The authorities agreed that some social transfers created disincentives
to work and that competitiveness had deteriorated due to rising labor costs in a context of declining
productivity. However, they viewed the business environment as conducive to attracting skilled
foreign workers, and stressed that their diversification strategy was based on improving overall
productivity—through increased public investment in the areas of targeted growth and through
training efforts—rather than narrowly focused on cost competitiveness. In that context, they took
note of the recommendations regarding the automatic indexation mechanism, but indicated that
consideration so far had only been given to making the current arrangement permanent and
limiting full indexation to the lower end of the wage scale.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

STAFF APPRAISAL
34.
The Luxembourg economy is rebounding. The fiscal position remains sound, the large
financial sector has been resilient, and the outlook is for growth to gradually firm up, yet without
returning to pre-crisis trend. Protracted low euro area growth as well as a larger-than-expected
impact on banks from euro area deleveraging trends and from the move to automatic exchange of
information constitute the main downside risks. EU-driven regulatory changes may also curtail
growth of the financial sector.
35.
Yet securing Luxembourg’s economic and social model calls for a proactive approach
to address the fiscal, financial, and structural challenges ahead. The fiscal position will soon
come under strain from losses in e-VAT revenues, the financial sector will have to adjust to a
changing external landscape, and Luxembourg’s cost competitiveness is being eroded. It will be
essential to adapt fiscal policies, manage the risks associated with the diversification of financial
sector activities, and preserve competitiveness to allow for alternative sources of growth.
36.
A moderate but sustained consolidation is essential to preserve the current healthy
fiscal position, underpinned by significant efforts on the expenditure side. A consolidation
effort of ½ percent of GDP for the next five years would allow public debt to stabilize below
30 percent of GDP, and the authorities to meet their medium-term objective by 2018, while
mitigating the impact on growth. Given current low rates, the planned VAT hike is appropriate, and
consideration should also be given to increasing the yield of property taxes. Yet, even after revenue
measures are implemented, it will remain critical to curb public spending growth; the expenditure
review underway will be a useful tool to identify savings. Changes to the design of some social
benefits should be a specific area of focus, as they would also help boost the economy’s growth
potential through greater labor participation. In that context, a reduction in social transfers could be
associated with the introduction of a well-targeted earned-income tax credit system.
37.
Adjustments to the fiscal framework should improve transparency. The planned
introduction of expenditure ceilings in the context of multi-annual budgeting, in line with EU
commitments, should support efforts to moderate spending growth. Likewise, the future fiscal
council should have the expertise and resources to monitor deviations from fiscal targets in full
independence. With the main target now defined in structural terms, output gap estimates will need
to be made conservatively—to avoid overstating the structural balance—and assessed
independently—to prevent politicization. Better information on tax expenditures and revenues
stemming from multinational activities would also help inform fiscal policy decisions.
38.
The financial sector’s resilience should be preserved as diversification proceeds. The
decision to front-load the implementation of Basel III’s capital requirements is welcome. Supervisors
should remain vigilant and carefully monitor developments to determine, in collaboration with
European authorities, whether specific additional measures may be warranted over time to reflect
the systemic size of a number of banks. They should also stand ready to take additional actions if
domestic real estate exposures continue to rise. Meanwhile, the authorities should move ahead

LUXEMBOURG

expeditiously to set up the ex ante deposit guarantee scheme and resolution fund required by
European legislation. The switch to the SSM also offers an opportunity to further strengthen
financial sector oversight, but a smooth transition will require the continued involvement of the
national competent authorities in the supervision of banks. In addition, the future Systemic Risk
Committee should play a leading role in monitoring the interconnections between domestic
financial sector actors and new emerging risks from financial diversification. To ward off reputational
risks, a more proactive focus on investor protection in the authorities’ communication strategy
would be beneficial.
39.
Structural policies should support Luxembourg’s efforts to diversify beyond the
financial sector. In particular, the expiration of the temporary agreement on wage indexation offers
an opportunity to adjust the mechanism in a way that allows wage and productivity developments
to be better aligned. At a minimum, annual indexation should be permanently capped at a level
closer to the ECB price stability objective than the current 2½ percent threshold, and escape clauses
considered when inflation among the main trading partners drops significantly below 2 percent. As
high real estate prices put pressures on wages, measures to support housing supply would
complement these efforts, including through more flexible rules on land use and higher holding
costs on unused properties. Meanwhile, the authorities should continue their efforts to match
workers’ skills with private sector needs, and the emergence of new firms should be facilitated by
improving administrative processes to start a business.
40.
It is recommended that the next Article IV Consultation with Luxembourg be held on
the standard 12-month cycle.

Table 2. Luxembourg: Risk Assessment Matrix
Source of risks

Surges in global financial market
volatility (related to UMP exit)

Reemergence of financial stress in
the euro area

More protracted recovery in the
euro area

Failure to address forthcoming
fiscal revenue losses and dynamic
public spending

Impact of changes in regulatory
European banking landscape larger
than expected, and/or
diversification strategy fails to
offset those changes
A sharp correction in housing
prices

Relative likelihood and channels of
transmission
High
Financial sector impact on the
investment fund industry through
portfolio reallocation.

Medium
Due to its role as a hub for euro
area financial activities,
Luxembourg’s financial sector
health is intrinsically linked to that
of the euro area’s.

High
Strong trade and financial linkages
make Luxembourg particularly
vulnerable to developments in the
euro area.
Low
Under unchanged policy, losses of
e-VAT and spending growth rate
far outstripping revenue growth
would lead to a substantial
deterioration of the fiscal position.
Medium
Luxembourg’s attraction as a
financial center for euro area
cross-border activities is
significantly diminished.
Low
Real estate exposures have risen to
22 percent of domesticallyoriented banks’ assets. These
banks’ assets account for 2½ times
GDP.

Impact if Realized
Low
Impact deemed limited unless the
global stress is particularly severe.
Policy response: Conduct stress tests
covering the entire financial sector,
beyond banks.
Medium
Financial service activities further
curtailed.
Policy response: Maintain existing
financial sector buffers; preserve
competitiveness, especially related
to wage growth, to support
diversification beyond financial
sector.
High
Economic recovery in Luxembourg
held back.
Policy response: Diversify toward
more dynamic non euro area
markets
High
The impact would be high if it
eventually comes to threaten
Luxembourg’s AAA rating.
Policy response: Articulate a clear
medium term consolidation
strategy.
High
Significant impact on growth,
employment, and public finances.
Policy response: Proactively pursue
diversification strategy while
scrutinizing associated new risks.
High
Credit flows would slow
substantially. In addition, given
their combined size, if support to
domestically-oriented banks is
needed, it would add significantly
to public debt.
Policy response: Monitor risk and
stand ready to take additional
macro-prudential measures.

Change in gross public sector debt

Source: IMF staff.
1/ Public sector is defined as general government.
2/ Based on available data.
3/ Long-term bond spread over German bonds.
4/ Defined as interest payments divided by debt stock (excluding guarantees) at the end of previous year.
5/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;
a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
6/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
7/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as ae(1+r).
8/ Includes asset changes and interest revenues (if any). For projections, includes exchange rate changes during the projection period.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

Appendix I. Exchange Rate Assessment
1.
Luxembourg’s current account gap is expected to narrow over the medium term.
Rising income and transfers, including the loss of e-commerce VAT revenue from 2015 and beyond,
will weigh on the current account. As a result, the external position is projected to move closer to its
equilibrium level in the medium term. These medium-term projections, however, do not reflect any
policy changes and are subject to large uncertainty from the intrinsic volatility in financial service
exports.
Staff estimates show that the exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals. The
Macroeconomic Balance (MB) and External Stability (ES) approaches indicate a slight undervaluation
of the real effective exchange rate (REER) while the Equilibrium Real Exchange Rate (ERER) approach
points to a mild overvaluation. Taking all together, the exchange rate is estimated to be close to the
equilibrium value implied by fundamentals, with no evidence of substantial misalignment.1 Under
the MB approach, the initial net foreign asset (NFA) position and relative income growth are the two
main contributors to the current account balance norm for Luxembourg, with a prudent fiscal
framework also playing a role, although to a lesser extent.

Economies that serve as hubs for international financial flows have tended to run substantial current account
surpluses and net creditor positions. This effect is captured in the IMF exchange rate assessment framework by a
financial center variable that represents the following economies: Belgium, Hong Kong SAR, Luxembourg,
Netherlands, Singapore, and Switzerland.

Appendix II. Implementation of Past Fund Advice
Recommendations

Authorities’ Response
Financial

Promote cross-border cooperation among
supervisors of non-EU banking groups and
investment funds.

Cooperation agreements have been signed with a
number of countries, particularly regarding AIFMs.

Continue pursuing regulatory enhancements not
requiring legislation.

A new minimum provisioning requirement for the
deposit guarantee scheme was introduced.
Individual bank-level recovery and resolution plans
are being discussed.

Continue encouraging banks to prepare for tighter
liquidity standards under Basel III.

Discussion with banks is proceeding, to grant
waivers for European bank subsidiaries where the
standards will apply at the group-level.

Revisit institutional arrangements for regulation and
supervision, to better align these with evolving
international standards.

Cooperation between institutions is being enhanced
in the context of the preparation for the Single
Supervisory Mechanism. A Systemic Risk Committee
will be established. The legal objectives of CSSF
have been clarified.

Fiscal
Undertake a more comprehensive reform of the
pension and healthcare systems to ensure fiscal
sustainability.

A pension reform was adopted in December 2012,
but more is needed. Further reforms to health care
are to be formulated.
Structural

Improve active labor market policies and the social
safety net with a view to minimizing work
disincentives and addressing market rigidities.

Luxembourg has reformed the public employment
agency, effectively stepping up job search
assistance.

Revise or eliminate the wage indexation system in
the medium term.

Revisions of the current system are being
considered by the new government.

Recommendations
Recommendations

Actions Taken to Date

1

Overall Financial Sector Oversight
Make the CSSF’s oversight procedures and
remedial actions more expeditious and effective.

A number of organizational and procedural changes have
taken place to expedite enforcement actions.

Continue to increase resources and skills for the
supervision of financial institutions in order to
better perform risk-focused inspections and
enforcement, and reduce reliance on the
compliance-oriented work of external auditors.

Staff and resources for CSSF were further increased to
around 500 full-time equivalent staff. A new department
responsible for AIFMs was created. Improved supervisory
techniques, including stress testing, and preparation
towards SSM also contribute to better risk-focused
supervision.

Revise the legal framework in order to ensure
full operational independence of the CSSF.

Legal provisions that could be interpreted as giving CSSF
an objective to promote the financial center were removed.
Ongoing work to revise the law to prepare for the SSM
could further improve the operational independence.

Clarify the respective responsibilities of the BCL
and CSSF in the conduct of financial supervision,
especially on liquidity risk and financial market
infrastructures, and formalize the modalities of
their collaboration and information exchanges.

The cooperation between the BCL and the CSSF is being
enhanced in the context of the preparation for the SSM.
The set-up of national Systemic Risk Committee is
expected to further strengthen that collaboration and
information exchange.

Banking Oversight
Continue to closely monitor intragroup
exposures to affiliate and parent banks, and take
action to limit them, including through the use
of formal sanctions, when necessary.

CSSF continues to closely monitor intra-group exposures
and subjects them to periodic stress testing. The new law
transposing CRD IV will give supervisors the power to
restrict such exposures if needed.

Investment Funds/Securities Markets Oversight
Enhance the duties of investment fund
depositaries and clarify the investment fund
shareholder/ownership rights.

Guidance to require investment funds to clarify their
shareholder/ownership rights was issued. The duties of
depositories will be enhanced through UCITS V.
Crisis Management

Strengthen the deposit insurance scheme
through ex ante funding, speedier and
automatic payments, the use of funds for bank
restructuring, and improved governance.

1

The payment period for the deposit insurance scheme was
shortened. Work to revise the scheme in line with European
requirements is ongoing.

Measures in italics denote those taken before the 2012 Article IV consultation.

36

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

LUXEMBOURG

Strengthen the bank resolution framework,
including by providing for earlier control of
problem banks and enhanced resolution tools.

Work to revise the bank resolution framework in line with
European requirements is ongoing.

Finalize contingency plans to ensure the
continuity of the ICSD.

Discussion with the ICSD on its contingency plans are
ongoing.

Formalize a multipartite domestic framework
providing for operational procedures and
decisive, quick and early intervention.

A multipartite domestic framework for crisis preparedness
consisting of the MoF, BCL, CAA and CSSF resumed its work.

Appendix IV. Financial Integrity and Transparency Issues
1.
While highly attractive, Luxembourg’s financial center may also be vulnerable to
misuse. Political stability and multilingual, qualified financial services advisors contribute to the
attractiveness of Luxembourg’s financial center. The FATF recently decided that Luxembourg had
made significant progress in addressing the deficiencies identified in its 2010 AML/CFT mutual
evaluation report.1 However, the AML/CFT and tax information exchange frameworks still suffer from
some shortcomings, such as an inadequate treatment of tax offenses, (notably in relation to the
revised (2012) AML/CFT standard), limited transparency of ownership of legal persons and
arrangements, and weaknesses in the detection of and exchange of financial intelligence and tax
information on non-residents. Both the OECD’s Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of
Information for Tax Purposes and the FATF have raised concerns in this regard. The authorities
indicated that they were waiting for the adoption of the European Union’s 4th AML/CFT Directive to
introduce the necessary amendments in their legal framework.
2.
The authorities are encouraged to include tax crimes amongst the predicate offenses
to money laundering. The scope of tax fraud2 has a number of limitations. Both the substance and
the implementation of this offense have been criticized. It may hamper international judicial
cooperation relating to tax offenses. For instance, non-residents who bring funds to Luxembourg in
order to evade taxes in their own country are not deemed to commit the offense covered by this
provision because using the Luxembourg legal framework does not amount per se to a “systematic
use of fraudulent means”. In addition, tax crimes are not predicate offenses to money laundering. In
these circumstances, the AML/CFT framework is not applicable in cases of tax crimes, which hampers
detection of, and international cooperation on, tax evaders. The authorities have indicated that they
are working towards including tax crimes as predicate offenses to money laundering as
recommended by the 2012 FATF standards.
3.
The authorities are taking steps to increase the transparency of legal persons that
issue bearer shares but have not taken similar measures with respect to legal arrangements.
The lack of transparency over legal persons is widely recognized as offering opportunities to
facilitate the laundering of criminal proceeds. On October 4, 2013, a bill providing for the
immobilization of bearer shares was submitted to Parliament. If adopted, this would play an
important role in increasing the transparency of legal persons. Nevertheless, further measures are
necessary to ensure that information relating to the beneficial ownership of legal entities is readily
available. This includes ensuring that adequate and accurate information on the beneficial owners of
legal persons is available in all cases, and may require changes in the Registry of Business and
Corporations (RCS)’s framework. Beneficial ownership information relating to trusts is only accessible

1

th

See FATF, 2014, Mutual Evaluation of Luxembourg: 6 Follow-up report.

2

The main tax crime in Luxembourg is the “escroquerie fiscale” as defined in Articles 396, paragraph 5, and 397 of the
Tax Code. Additional tax offenses include the “fraude fiscale” (Article 396, paragraph 1, of the Tax Code) and offenses
relating to indirect taxes, and customs and excise duties.

38

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

LUXEMBOURG

in the course of criminal proceedings and the identification of trusts and their beneficial owners is
not carried out in a systematic manner. The Committee on Transferable Securities (within the CSSF)
and the Committee on Company Law (within the Ministry of Justice) are currently conducting a joint
analysis of the shortcomings in the area of transparency of legal persons, trusts and other legal
arrangements.
The framework for exchanging financial intelligence on non-residents potentially misusing
Luxembourg’s financial sector is in place but would benefit from further strengthening. An
important number of AML/CFT inspection missions have taken place over the past years, the
number of suspicious transactions reports have increased and the number of sanctions pronounced
has increased. In addition, the authorities appear to request information from foreign counterparts
as soon as a foreign person appears in a suspicious transaction report—a critical element given that
the majority of predicate crimes may be committed outside the country. Almost 10,000 AML/CFTrelated information requests have been sent in 2012, as opposed to less than 3,000 in 2010.
However, the decreasing number of inspections of banks in 2013, the short length of the onsite
inspection missions (3-5 days) and the relatively low amount of fines imposed in 2013 (less than
EUR150,000) could impact the effectiveness of the supervisory process.3 It also appears that one
single bank disclosed more than 85 percent of all the suspicious transactions in 2012, and explains
the high number of information exchanged. A draft law concerning the harmonization and update
of the general legal framework on sanctions and prudential powers of the CSSF is being discussed
by the authorities. With regard to exchange of information for tax purposes, the November 2013
Phase 2 Global Forum report indicated significant delays in responses to foreign requests, based on
the analysis of the response timeframe for years 2009–11. The authorities indicate that
communications with requesting partners have significantly improved in the last years.

3

Fund staff experience and indications from some FATF members with supervisory frameworks that are generally
considered to be effective suggest that onsite inspections missions last 2-3 weeks on average, depending on the size
of the financial institution. Similarly, much higher fines have been pronounced for non-compliance with AML/CFT
equirements by some foreign supervisors, with several fines higher than US$10 million (e.g.: JP Morgan Chase, TD
Bank, TCF National Bank, HSBC Holdings in the US.; Standard Bank PLC in the U.K.; UBS France in France).

STATISTICAL ISSUES
A. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General:
Data provision is adequate for surveillance. The Central Service for Statistics and Economic Studies
(Statec) regularly publishes a full range of economic and financial data and provides an advance
release calendar for main statistical releases at:
http://www.statistiques.public.lu/fr/agenda/calendrier-diffusion/index.html.
On-line access to Statec’s databases and those of other jurisdictions is available to all users
simultaneously at the time of release through the Statistics Portal of Luxembourg.
Key publicly accessible websites for macroeconomic data and analysis are:
Statistics Portal of Luxembourg
Statec
Central Bank of Luxembourg
Ministry of Finance

http://www.statistiques.public.lu/fr/
http://www.statec.public.lu/fr/index.html
http://www.bcl.lu/en/index.php
http://www.mf.public.lu/

National Accounts:
Luxembourg avails itself of the SDDS special flexibility for the timeliness of the national accounts,
and generally disseminates national accounts data not later than four months after the reference
period (the SDDS timeliness requirement for the national accounts is three months). Reduction of
the reporting lag would aid surveillance.

B. Data Standards and Quality
Luxembourg has been a subscriber to the Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) since
May 12, 2006. Luxembourg uses SDDS flexibility options on the timeliness of national accounts and
analytical accounts of the central bank.
No data ROSC is available.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2014 Article IV Consultation with Luxembourg
On May 2, 2014, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation1 with Luxembourg.
With a strong policy framework, Luxembourg has weathered the crisis well and the economy is
rebounding. The fiscal position remains sound, and the large financial sector has been resilient.
After a shallow recession in 2012, growth reached 2.1 percent in 2013. The improving economic
and financial environment in Europe drove the recovery in services exports. Meanwhile, healthy
public finances, accommodative credit conditions, and continued employment growth supported
domestic demand.
The outlook is for growth to firm up but without returning to its pre-crisis trend. Output is
forecast to grow broadly in line with potential (2 to 2½ percent) over 2014-19. The economy is
facing several challenges. The financial sector will have to adjust to a changing external
landscape, public finances will soon come under strain from losses in e-VAT revenue and strong
expenditure growth, and Luxembourg’s cost competitiveness is being eroded.
Securing Luxembourg’s economic and social model calls for a proactive approach. A moderate
but sustained fiscal consolidation is essential to preserve the sound fiscal position. Beyond
revenue measures under consideration, steps will also be required to curtail rapid public spending
growth. On the financial front, resilience should be preserved as diversification proceeds. The
decision to front-load the implementation of Basel III’s capital requirements is welcome, but
systemic banks should be carefully monitored, in coordination with European authorities, to
determine whether additional measures may be warranted over time. Supervisors also need to
continue to closely monitor domestic real estate exposures, interconnections in the domestic
financial sector, and new emerging risks from financial diversification. Finally, the expiration of
the temporary agreement on wage indexation offers an opportunity to adjust the mechanism in a

way that better aligns wages and productivity movements. Measures to strengthen labor skills
and the business environment would also further support the authorities’ strategy to diversify
beyond the financial sector.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors commended the authorities for their strong policy management, which
helped Luxembourg weather the recent economic crisis well. Directors noted that while growth
is rebounding, the country faces several external and internal challenges. To preserve the main
features of Luxembourg’s economic and social model, they agreed that policy priorities ahead
should continue to focus on fiscal and structural reforms, adjustment to the changing external
financial environment, and economic diversification.
Directors noted that although the fiscal position is reassuring, losses from e-VAT revenues and
rapid expenditure growth would pose strains in the coming years. To ensure fiscal sustainability,
they called for a moderate growth-friendly fiscal consolidation. Directors supported the planned
VAT hike and encouraged the authorities to consider increasing the yield of property taxes. In
addition, they saw need to curtail public spending, while preserving social cohesion. Directors
welcomed the expenditure review underway as a useful tool to identify savings. They
encouraged the authorities to reconsider the social benefits systems, particularly the pension
system, as reforms in this area would also help boost the economy’s growth potential through
greater labor participation. The planned introduction of expenditure ceilings in the context of a
multi-year budgetary framework should also support efforts to moderate spending growth.
Directors took note of high bank capitalization and liquidity, and the strong growth of the
investment fund industry. They underscored the need to preserve the financial sector’s resilience
as diversification proceeds. Directors commended the authorities for their decision to front-load
the implementation of Basel III’s capital requirements. They noted that supervisors should
remain vigilant and carefully monitor developments in the sector to determine whether specific
additional measures may be warranted taking into account the systemic size of a number of
banks. Directors underscored the need to continue to closely monitor domestic real estate
exposures, interconnections in the domestic financial sector, and new emerging risks from
financial diversification. They also encouraged the authorities to move expeditiously to set up the
ex ante deposit guarantee scheme and resolution fund required by European legislation. Further
improvements in transparency and strengthening of the Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the
Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) framework are also called for.

2

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers
used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

3
Directors agreed that economic diversification beyond the financial sector is essential to improve
Luxembourg’s growth prospects and create new job opportunities. They noted that despite a
strong external position, the country might be pricing itself out of some activities because of
substantial labor cost increases. Directors encouraged the authorities to adjust the wage
indexation mechanism to better link wage and productivity movements. Measures to tackle labor
market rigidities and reduce skills mismatch would support the authorities’ strategy to diversify
beyond the financial sector.

Statement by Menno Snel, Executive Director for Luxembourg and Amela Hubic, Senior
Advisor to the Executive Director
May 2, 2014
The Luxembourg authorities would like to thank staff for their comprehensive analysis. It
provides an objective view of the macroeconomic situation in Luxembourg and the challenges
the economy is facing. The authorities broadly agree with the staff’s analysis and
recommendations.
The country’s continued stable political, social and regulatory environment has helped the
economy and financial sector to weather the recent global financial and the European sovereign
debt crisis well. The authorities have followed prudent macroeconomic and counter-cyclical
fiscal policies, and have paid careful attention to developing a climate conducive to business and
investment. Luxembourg is among the few European countries to maintain an AAA credit rating
assessment with stable outlook from all three major credit agencies, clearly demonstrating the
market’s confidence in the country, and its macroeconomic and financial fundamentals. The new
three-party coalition government took office in December 2013 following early elections in
October 2013.
Recent economic developments and outlook
After a slight contraction in 2012, the economy recovered in 2013 and registered a real GDP
growth of 2.1 percent in the context of the rebound of euro area economies. The authorities
project the economy to grow by 3.2 percent of GDP in 2014 and on average by 3.5 percent of
GDP over the period 2015-2018 - better medium-term prospects than estimated by staff. The
projections are based on a number of factors, among others: (i) sustainable pick-up of the euro
area growth; (ii) a recovery in the global economy; and (iii) favorable stock exchange
developments. Nevertheless, the authorities are aware that the trend growth slowed down
markedly from the pre-crisis period. Growth projections for the medium term, produced by the
independent national statistical authority, are hence being considered with the necessary
prudence. The authorities will carefully analyze and consider different policy options – to be
included in the 2015 budget – which will be growth friendly and at the same time reflect the new
economic reality, in particular in terms of public spending.
Inflation is expected to be 0.9 percentage point higher in 2015 than estimated by staff, on the
account of a 2 percentage point increase of VAT. Employment has recorded an increase of 1.7
percent in 2013, less than its trend level. Close to one third of new jobs were created in the
public sector. The government’s latest projections show that the employment growth will
accelerate in the coming years and amount to 1.9 percent in 2014, and will stabilize at 2.3
percent beyond 2015. The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate is on the rise, reaching a
historical peak of 6.9 percent at the end of 2013. Unemployment tends to become more structural
as rightly emphasized in the staff report. Almost half of the unemployed are lowskilled and a
quarter of them are long-term unemployed. The authorities, conscious of this problem, have
already adopted several measures in order to address it. For example, the employment agency is
operating under new management with more staff and an upgraded IT system, with a new
organizational system and a more proactive approach allowing for better matching. Further

2
measures are in preparation, and these will tackle in particular theinactivity and unemployment
traps.
Public finances
The economic and financial crisis has weakened public finances. Nevertheless, Luxembourg has
maintained its relatively low level of public debt, 23 percent of GDP in 2013 - among the lowest
in the euro area - as well as a significant budgetary safety margin with respect to the Maastricht
deficit reference value of 3 percent of GDP. The budget balance remained consistently well
above this reference value. Moreover, significant assets to fund future pension liabilities - these
amounted to 26.9 percent of GDP at the end of 2013 - have been accumulated and set aside in a
dedicated Fund.
However, the country is facing a series of challenges of a structural nature that will have a direct
impact on the public finances. Potential growth is declining and the high degree of openness of
the economy and its specialization in financial services make public revenues vulnerable to high
volatility. The recent move to automatic exchange of information adds additional uncertainty on
revenues; and the entry into force of the new regime for VAT on e-commerce of the 2008 EU
Council Directive (2008/8/EC) will generate a loss of around 1.5 percent of GDP of VAT
revenue beginning 2015. At the same time, public expenditures display downward rigidity with a
significant part growing autonomously, independent of the business cycle. The ageing population
also impacts public finances over the long term.
The general government balance increased from a neutral stance in 2012 to a small surplus of 0.1
percent of GDP in 2013. Given the early elections in October 2013, the 2014 budget had to go
through two steps. The first four months were run under a so-called ‘current procedure’, with a
partial continuity of the 2013 budgetary articles to allow for the smoothing functioning of the
State. Second, the 2014 budget was voted on April 24. In this budget, consolidation measures of
0.5 percent of GDP were announced: 60 percent of these savings are to be achieved through a
reduction of public investments; 21 percent through a reduction of the operating costs of the
central government; and the remaining part represents savings from a new scheme of financial
grants and loans for students in higher education. These additional consolidation measures will
lead to a surplus of 0.2 percent of GDP in 2014.
For 2015, the authorities are keenly aware that, without additional corrective measures, the fiscal
situation will deteriorate significantly. This deterioration will be mainly driven by the loss in
VAT revenue from e-commerce activities and continued buoyant expenditure growth. Therefore,
the authorities are committed to act firmly. On the revenue side, as a first measure, the
government has already decided that all VAT rates will be increased by two percentage points
with the exception of the 3 percent rate on basic goods, in order to shield the poorest households.
This measure is expected to generate 0.7 percent of GDP of additional revenue. Moreover, the 3
percent rate would be henceforth limited to purchases of owner-occupied homes, constituting a
first step in reducing excessive government support for housing demand. The planned reduction
of this important budget expenditure in the housing market is part of the authorities’ efforts to
provide an adequate policy response to the housing market, with a shift from demand-based
policies to more supply-based policies. In this context, staff’s recommendation to increase
property tax is still under consideration. The remaining part of consolidation for 2015 is expected

3
to take place by implementing additional measures with a focus on slowing expenditure growth.
On the outlay side, the authorities have initiated a comprehensive expenditure review as a tool to
prioritize savings over the next four years. The review is conducted in four phases from
conception to implementation, with analysis across both ministerial and functional lines. 20
working groups have been established. The analytical phase will be finalized in June and provide
the government with a report that will list a menu of savings measures. In line with the country’s
2014 update of the Stability Program, fiscal consolidation needs an amount of 1 billion euro in
structural terms for the period 2015-2018. The aim is to ensure a gradual and sustainable return
to balanced public finances by the end of the government’s tenure in 2018.
The staff report rightly emphasizes that the debt-to-GDP ratio has tripled in the period 20072013, from 6.7 to about 23 percent. Nonetheless, Luxembourg’s debt level remains well below
the 60 percent level of the Maastricht criteria, the net public debt is significantly lower, and the
public debt is entirely denominated in euro. The authorities are committed to keep the public
debt below 30 percent - as the only sustainable trajectory.
The authorities are aware of the importance of putting the public finances on a sound footing in
the long term, including keeping public debt levels low, and have introduced several new
initiatives. An important healthcare reform became effective on January 1, 2011 - and further
reforms are being discussed - while pension reform was adopted late 2012. The authorities
concur with the staff’s view about the need to place Luxembourg’s old-age pension system on a
sustainable path. The pension system still suffers from a number of costly rigidities, including
the adjustment of benefits to both price and real wage developments. The authorities are aware
that the recent reform might not be sufficient to solve the problems of the pension system. But,
under the new pension regime, the authorities appraise every five years by means of an actuarial
study the consistency between the assumptions underlying the reform and the updated financial
trajectory of the scheme. This regular reassessment allows prompt corrective measures in case of
expected shortfalls.
A law establishing a multi-year budgetary framework is currently undergoing the national
legislative procedure. The framework would apply to all levels of government and include multiyear expenditure ceilings - consistent with the new EU requirements under the legislative “six
pack” and the Fiscal Compact. Important steps have been taken to set up an independent Fiscal
council that will be provided with sufficient resources and expertise in order to monitor
deviations from fiscal targets.
Financial sector
Luxembourg’s financial sector has weathered the recent crises relatively well and remains
generally sound. Nevertheless, significant regulatory changes at the European level – in
particular those related to the banking union - and the recent move to automatic exchange of
information from January 2015 represent challenges. The authorities believe that these
challenges could have upside risks as they could strengthen the financial center’s advantages in
the long term by ensuring a transparent environment, a level playing field and a more stable
European banking system. Luxembourg’s unique ‘eco-system’ – described by staff as ‘a unique
concentration of diversified financial institutions and related services, providing services based

4
on the EU rulebook and civil law tradition, and supported by multilingual workforce’ - will also
continue to attract new business and support its role as a financial hub within the euro area.
Banking sector. The aggregate banking sector balance sheet has contracted over the last few
years, largely driven by a decline of asset values during the peak of the crisis, and more recently,
the contraction in intragroup exposures with core euro area parent banks. The total assets
recorded a level of 711 billion euro in February 2014. The capitalization and liquidity ratios
remain sound, with Tier 1 capital ratio over 16 percent and liquid assets to total assets at around
60 percent. The NPLs are extremely low. The banking sector continues to be profitable and an
important liquidity provider.
While some banks are leaving Luxembourg, mainly because of the deleveraging process of
parent banks, large banking groups expand their presence in the country because of its role and
expertise as a hub for back-office and custodian services within the euro area. Private banking is
undergoing a transformation - partly in response to the switch to automatic exchange of
information - becoming more service-oriented and catering increasingly to high net-worth
individuals. The banking sector is strengthening its ties with emerging market economies. Eight
new banks opened a branch or subsidiary in 2013 and a few more have applied for a banking
license. The sector, together with the backing of the government, is also working to position
itself as a European hub for the Renminbi business. Thus, diversification of the forward-looking
financial sector across business activities, investment destinations and customer bases will help
support and further develop banking activities.
The investment fund industry remains an important component of the financial system, and it
continues to expand. The country is the second largest investment fund domicile in the world
after the US. With over 2.6 trillion euro in March 2014, assets in Luxembourg-domiciled
regulated funds reached a historical ceiling. This is a result of both revaluation of assets held and
new inflows. The industry continues to invest in a diversified class of assets and caters to a
diverse pool of investors. Furthermore, the authorities see the recent rapid transposition of the
Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive as another opportunity to develop new
activities and support the industry. The authorities take note of staff’s recommendation that an
enhanced and proactive communication by the authorities and the industry would be beneficial,
emphasizing ongoing efforts focused on investor and depositor protection. They stressed that the
legal framework was in place but would need to be better communicated.
Regulatory issues. The authorities have made substantial progress in strengthening financial
sector supervision and the regulatory framework. To improve the financial stability policy
framework, they followed the FSAP recommendation on this issue, by further enhancing onsite
supervisions and by hiring highly qualified staff. Indeed, staffing resources of the supervisory
authority (CSSF) have been significantly increased to 500 full-time equivalent staff, which
resulted in more frequent on-site inspections and augmented enforcement actions. The CSSF has
also improved its supervisory techniques, including stress testing, and its preparation towards
SSM also contributes to better risk-focused supervision. Similarly, the Central Bank (BCL) has
expanded and strengthened its supervisory activities. Its liquidity monitoring and surveillance
framework at the institutional level comprises qualitative and forward-looking quantitative
analyses, which include both off-site analysis and on-site inspections. Moreover, the BCL
requires from a large proportion of banks to provide their liquidity gap projections on a daily

5
basis. Nonetheless, the increasing number of tasks falling within the remit of the BCL’s
responsibilities calls for the strengthening of its human and financial resources. In this context,
the Bank’s need for an increase of capital has been brought to the attention of the government
and has been corroborated by the BCL’s external auditor.
The cooperation between the BCL and the CSSF is being enhanced through the evolution of
institutional arrangements in the context of the preparation for the SSM. The recent proposal to
establish a national Systemic Risk Committee (SRC) involving supervisors, the BCL and the
Finance Ministry is expected to further strengthen that collaboration and information exchange.
The authorities took note of staff’s recommendation to closely monitor the links between the
various domestic financial actors. Indeed, the SRC would be the right setting to monitor these
risks through system-wide stress testing. However, the authorities do not share staff’s
concerns/analysis regarding the scenario on possible redemptions from investment funds’ impact
on banking sector liquidity needs. Investment funds have a number of options to address an
increase in redemption requests: sell assets (highly liquid UCITS funds); suspend redemptions to
avoid disruptions; and as a last resort, borrow from liquid banks.
The authorities also do not concur with the description of financial integrity and transparency
issues, as they appear mainly in Appendix IV of the staff report. By bundling together
AML/CFT, tax offences, transparency of legal persons and arrangements as well as exchange of
information with foreign counterparts in a single, mainly negative sentence, the report ignores
the very real progress made on all of them. This is discouraging and thus counterproductive. The
staff report gives the impression of losing sight of the objective which is to fight money
laundering and the financing of terrorism. This should first of all be achieved through efficient
prevention and, secondly, through detection and penalizing of offenders. Its effectiveness cannot
be measured in numbers of inspections, reportings of suspicious transactions and fines, but only
in a decrease of actual money laundering or financing of terrorism. Finally, the authorities have
provided staff with answers to show that the framework and actions implemented are effective in
avoiding that financial institutions established in Luxembourg are abused for illegal or illicit
activities.
Other issues
Diversification of the economy beyond financial activities. The authorities are committed to
pursue efforts to diversify the structure of the economy, which is currently largely based on the
financial sector activities. Specific sectors of growth such as logistics, ICT and bio- and ecotechnologies have been chosen for this purpose. These diversification efforts are already starting
to bear fruit, in particular in the rapidly growing ICT sector. As regards logistics, the government
decided to re-use the existing facilities, close to railway and highway networks, to expand this
sector without making significant investments. It has put in place a training facility to prepare
staff for employment in this sector, which will partially tackle the problem of long-term
unemployment of low-skilled workers.
Competitiveness and unit labor cost (ULC). The authorities noted the deterioration in price
competitiveness over the last decade, due to relatively high wage increases coupled with low
productivity growth. Wages and benefits are linked to inflation through an automatic indexation
mechanism. The authorities took steps to improve competitiveness by introducing a law that

6
temporarily modified - until October 2014 - the system of wage indexation. Moreover, this law
foresees that at least 12 months should elapse between each indexation step of 2.5 percent.
From 2015 on, the automatic indexation will return to its previous mode. The authorities are
aware that this modulation is only temporary and that the room for maneuver in terms of
productivity gains is getting smaller. Therefore, it is essential to preserve the competitiveness by
limiting the growth of ULCs. The authorities will use the coming months to work closely with
unions and employers’ representatives on a more permanent solution which should not
undermine social cohesion in Luxembourg.
Housing market. Both structural and cyclical factors continue to contribute to the divergence
between supply and demand in the housing market. On the demand side, several factors interfere:
high demand from residents and cross-border workers; relatively high population and
immigration growth; government housing benefits policies; and low mortgage interest rates. On
the supply side, administrative constraints and low recurring taxes on immovable property seem
to be the restraining factors. As mentioned above, the authorities are in the process of a review of
expenditures where housing benefits will carefully be analyzed and if needed reconsidered. A
measure on the VAT side, to be implemented in 2015, constitutes already a first step in reducing
demand. Furthermore, staff notes that domestic residential real estate exposure of domesticallyoriented banks has increased and would require monitoring. In this context, the authorities have
taken several important steps such as raising risk weights for mortgage loans exceeding
80 percent LTV ratios as well as requiring frequent stress testing. In addition, the CSSF, in
conjunction with the BCL, stands ready to take additional macro-prudential measures if
exposures continue to rise.
