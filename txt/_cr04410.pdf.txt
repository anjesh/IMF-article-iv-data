-3EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Armenia’s economy has performed well during the last three years. Prudent financial policies,
structural reforms, and external financial support contributed to double-digit economic growth,
low inflation, declining fiscal, quasi-fiscal, and external imbalances, and poverty reduction.
Most targets under the PRGF-supported program were met, although some structural reforms
suffered from delays or deficient implementation. The program was closely aligned with the
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP).
The discussions focused on policies to sustain growth and foster poverty reduction, which are
the key challenges ahead. Future policies entail a deepening of structural reforms to revamp tax
and customs administration, strengthen the financial sector and the judiciary, and improve
expenditure management. While important reforms have taken place in the energy and water
sectors, the reform agenda should be completed with the support of the World Bank.
¾

The stance of monetary policy is in line with the authorities’ 3-percent inflation objective.
The staff encouraged the authorities to deepen the market for government bonds to
facilitate monetary management and eventual private debt issues.

¾

Armenia’s flexible trade and exchange rate regimes have served the country well. The
recent appreciation of the dram is offsetting the effect of higher import prices and is
compatible with large productivity gains in tradable sectors since 2001.

¾

The 2005 budget is expected to maintain a prudent fiscal stance and align expenditures
with PRSP priorities on infrastructure outlays. A fiscal deficit slightly above 2 percent of
GDP is consistent with economic stability and with increases in social and infrastructure
spending. The authorities need to monitor the effectiveness of expenditures and increase
capacity and accountability in state-owned noncommercial organizations.

¾

There is a need to revamp the tax and customs administration agencies to boost efficiency
and reduce discretion, especially by making wide use of risk-based audit systems for
collection, VAT refunds, and customs clearance. The staff has also advised the authorities
to revisit the organizational structure of the tax and customs agencies and bring them
under the control of the Ministry of Finance.

¾

The recent strengthening of the banking system and growth in private sector credit are
promising developments. Remaining reforms involve enhancing corporate governance,
streamlining collateral recovery procedures, and improving court processes.

¾

To tackle lingering governance problems, the implementation of the recently prepared
anti-corruption strategy should be stepped up and complemented with appropriate
penalties for abuse and with an efficient and independent judicial system.

Armenia has made substantial progress in setting up the basic framework for sound
macroeconomic policies and the makings of a modern market economy. The implementation of
the narrow set of recent or remaining reforms requires, however, a higher degree of political
commitment. Such resolve will be critical for the success of an eventual successor program that
could be supported by the Fund.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Discussions on the 2004 Article IV consultation and the sixth review under the Poverty
Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) were held in Yerevan from August 26 to September 9,
2004.1 Armenia’s three-year PRGF arrangement for SDR 69 million (75 percent of quota) was
approved on May 23, 2001 (IMF Country Report No. 02/73). The equivalent of
SDR 60 million has been disbursed, and the equivalent of SDR 9 million will be available upon
completion of this review (Table 1). The arrangement expires on December 31, 2004.
2.
The thrust of the Fund’s policy advice in previous Article IV consultations has been
broadly implemented, especially in the areas of macroeconomic stabilization and quasi-fiscal
reforms. In concluding the 2002 Article IV consultation on September 25, 2002 (Armenia is
on a 24-month consultation cycle), Directors commended the authorities for their success in
maintaining macroeconomic stability and welcomed the envisaged reduction in the fiscal
deficit. They expressed concern that there had been slippages in the implementation of key
structural policies and emphasized the importance of improving tax administration, clearing
budgetary arrears, and pursuing reforms to restructure the banking system and improve
performance in the energy and water sectors. Most recommendations made in the context of
the Article IV consultation overlapped with conditionality in the PRGF-supported program
(Appendix I).
3.
Given Armenia’s long-term program engagement with the Fund, the staff has
prepared an ex post assessment of past involvement.2 The assessment concludes that
Armenia’s engagement with the Fund has been beneficial to policymaking and has facilitated
access to external financing.3 The authorities have expressed interest in continued Fund
support through a successor PRGF arrangement. In the attached Letter of Intent
(Attachment I), the authorities request the completion of the sixth review and a waiver for the
nonobservance of end-July 2004 energy sector performance criteria. In the accompanying
Memorandum of Economic Policies (Attachment II), the authorities describe a set of policies
designed to maintain the reform momentum in coming months.

The staff representatives met with the Prime Minister, Mr. Margaryan; the Minister of Finance and Economy,
Mr. Khachatryan; the Chairman of the Central Bank, Mr. Sargsyan; the Economic Advisor to the President,
Mr. Nercissantz, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Oskanian; the Minister of Justice, Mr. Haroutyunian;
other senior officials; and representatives of nongovernmental organizations, the donor community, and the
private sector. The staff team comprised Mr. Gelbard (head), Ms. George, Mr. McHugh (Resident
Representative), and Mr. Beddies (all MCD); Ms. Redifer (PDR); Mr. Bhatia (MFD); and Mr. Simone (FAD).
Ms. Minasyan and Mr. Stepanyan (economists at the local office) provided valuable support. Mr. Christiansen
(head of the ex post assessment team) conducted discussions on the assessment of performance under
Fund-supported programs on September 13.

The report on the ex post assessment has been distributed to the Executive Board.

A summary of Armenia’s relations with the Fund, including technical assistance provided and assessments of
standards and codes, is presented in Appendix II. Armenia’s structural reform agenda is also supported by the
World Bank Group (Appendix III), the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (Appendix IV),
and bilateral donors.

II. STOCKTAKING OF PERFORMANCE IN RECENT YEARS

momentum and of economic activity. The
situation has improved since 2001 and the country has enjoyed unprecedented levels of
investment and foreign financing (including support from the Armenian diaspora).
Nevertheless, Armenia’s reform agenda remains to be finished, poverty is high, and trade
prospects are crippled because of unresolved disputes with Turkey and Azerbaijan.4

6.
The PRGF-supported program has focused on measures necessary for sustained
macroeconomic stability and a deepening of structural reforms. The program aimed at
reducing the fiscal and quasi-fiscal deficits, repaying domestic and foreign arrears, lowering
debt ratios, and running a cautious monetary policy in a flexible exchange rate environment.
The structural reform agenda was geared to support stabilization efforts, reduce
vulnerabilities, and sustain medium-term growth prospects. It focused on improving the
business environment, strengthening the banking system, tax and customs administration,
and expenditure management, as well as increasing efficiency in the energy and water sectors
(Appendix I).
7.
The program has been consistent with Armenia’s PRSP.5 The policies and
programs envisaged in the PRSP have been progressively integrated into the Medium-Term
Expenditure Framework (MTEF) and the budget process. The authorities have changed
expenditure priorities in the budget, implemented reforms in the areas of health and
education, and proceeded to develop monitoring indicators.6 They have also been refocusing
their efforts on social policies and the rural economy.

The accompanying Selected Issues paper contains an assessment of Armenia’s reforms and future challenges.

An interim PRSP was prepared in March 2001, and the full PRSP was finalized in September 2003 (IMF
Country Report No. 03/362).

In October 2004, the authorities prepared a draft Annual Progress Report of PRSP implementation. The draft
outlines the policies adopted during the last year, including the additional allocations for poverty-reducing

The policies supported by the program have been remarkably successful on the
macroeconomic front. Annual real GDP growth averaged 12 percent between 2001 and
2003 and poverty rates fell. Growth, fueled by grant and privately financed investment and
exports, was broad-based. The external

10.
Most of the envisaged structural reforms were carried out, but some suffered
from delays and weak implementation. There was good progress in strengthening
expenditure control, reducing red tape, and improving efficiency in the energy and water
sectors. By mid-2004, EBRD transition indicators showed that Armenia fared quite well
compared to other CIS countries on all dimensions of structural reforms. Still, this positive
assessment is tempered by some delays and weak implementation. For instance, there have

expenditures and the improvement in poverty indicators. The authorities are expected to finalize the draft by
end-November, after which the staffs will proceed to prepare the corresponding Joint Staff Advisory Note.

III. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
11.
The political situation is stable but the influence of vested interests is a concern. The
government coalition remains firmly in control following anti-government demonstrations in
April. At that time, the opposition contested the legitimacy of President Kocharian’s reelection in 2003. More recently, the increasing influence of vested interests in parliament led
to the stalling of pieces of tax legislation and the granting of tax privileges.9 These
developments are worrisome as they put the country’s prospects for lasting reform at risk. On
the international arena, the European Union has recently included Armenia in the
configuration of the “wider Europe” initiative, an event that in the long term could foster
economic integration and contribute to a diplomatic solution to the Nagorno-Karabakh
conflict.10 The latter, however, cannot be easily resolved because of deep-rooted sensitivities
in both Armenia and Azerbaijan.

8

This reflected choices made by the authorities (e.g., prolonged period of intervention of commercial banks) as
well as the influence of vested interests and capacity constraints (e.g., discretion and inefficiency in tax and
customs administration).
9

As in other countries of the former Soviet Union, powerful business interests have emerged in the transition to
a market economy. These interests have been exerting influence in the media, parliament, and in government
decisions. NGOs have also been vocal about this issue as well as corruption in general.

10

In mid-June, the EU included Armenia, Georgia, and Azerbaijan in the European Neighborhood Policy with
the aim of promoting stability in the region.

reduction in external private grants, fueled by
increases in agricultural production, housing
construction, and services. GDP growth for the
year as a whole is projected at 9 percent
(Table 2). The 12-month rate of inflation fell
from 8.6 percent in December 2003 to
6.1 percent in September. The central bank’s
inflation objective of 3 percent for 2004 is within
reach, although it may be exceeded slightly
because of recent increases in the price of
imported fuels.

Poverty and income inequality have been falling, but they still remain high. The
improvements are much smaller in cities other than Yerevan and in rural areas. The overall
poverty rate fell from 51 percent in 2001 to an

2015 (Table 3).
14.
Fiscal policy has remained prudent, with somewhat higher-than-programmed tax
revenues and lower-than-programmed expenditures. Tax revenues through September 2004
increased by 21 percent over the same period last year.12 In June, Parliament approved a
supplementary budget allocation entailing an increase in expenditures of 0.7 percent of GDP.
The higher expenditures focus on priority capital expenditures and will be executed during a
12-month period. Notwithstanding the additional allocation, the fiscal deficit is projected
at 1.3 percent of GDP in 2004 because of under-execution of expenditures (Table 4). The
under-execution reflects a combination of factors, including optimistic assumptions about the
timing for implementation of donor-financed projects and capacity constraints.13
11

The 2003 figures are preliminary estimates from the authorities. World Bank staff estimates that poverty and
inequality have fallen even further.

12

The tax-to-GDP ratio, however, may not improve as expected in 2004 if growth and/or the GDP deflator turn
out to be higher than projected.

13

The execution of current expenditures has improved in 2004, but problems remain regarding the execution of
capital expenditures. The authorities indicated that they expect an improvement in 2005.

-9-

15.
Monetary policy has also been prudent.
Money demand has been increasing in light of
strong economic activity and improved
confidence in the banking system. In 2004,
reserve money and broad money are projected to
grow at about 4 percent and 15 percent,
respectively (Table 5).
16.
The external current account balance
and debt ratios are improving. After a slight
deterioration in 2003, the current account deficit
is expected to narrow to 5.6 percent of GDP in
2004 because of higher workers’ remittances.14
Both import and export growth will be lower this
year than in 2003, as last year’s grant-induced
surge in imports dissipates and diamond export
growth is hindered by increased competition
from other countries. Despite lower capital
grants, the capital and financial account remain
well supported by continued increases in foreign
investment. Gross international reserves are
expected to remain slightly below four months of
imports. Lastly, Armenia’s debt management
strategy during the last two years has been
successful, and external debt ratios are projected
to decline further in 2004–05 (Table 6).15

Flexible trade and exchange regimes have served Armenia well in recent years.16
Since late 2003, strong capital inflows and higher remittances have contributed to an
appreciation of the dram. In the 12-months to August 2004, the real exchange rate
appreciated by 11 percent, helping to mitigate the effect of recent hikes in the prices of
imported fuels on inflation and on real income. The appreciation does not pose a threat to

14

According to official statistics, worker remittances (private transfers and worker compensation inflows) are
equivalent to 8 percent of GDP, but unofficial estimates point to a figure between 15 and 25 percent of GDP.

15

During 2002-03, external financing contained a balanced mix of grants and concessional borrowing, and
domestic debt issuance was limited. Payment arrears were cleared in 2003, and debt-for-equity swaps lowered
the stock of external debt. Armenia has an excellent record of servicing its obligations to the Fund.

16

The exchange rate fluctuates in response to market forces, although the central bank intervenes occasionally
in the foreign exchange market to smooth out volatility. Armenia accepted the obligations under Article VIII,
Sections 2(a), 3, and 4 of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement in 1992 and maintains an exchange system free of
restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions, except for exchange restrictions
kept for security reasons.

export competitiveness because (i) the real
exchange rate had depreciated by more than
25 percent between 2000 and 2003 and (ii)
productivity gains are boosting exports and real
wages and are thus compatible with the recent real
appreciation.17

Banking sector performance has
improved, especially during the last year, and there
has been a gradual return of confidence toward
banks following the resolution of eight banks that had been intervened by the government
(Table 7). The last intervened institution to be resolved, Armcommunications Bank, was
recapitalized by a new investor in October 2004.18 Since mid-2003, monetization has been
rising, the currency-to-deposits ratio has been falling, and interest rates have continued their
gradual declining trend. Private sector credit grew by 43 percent in the year through
September, albeit from a low base. However, dollarization (measured by the ratio of foreign
currency deposits to total deposits) remains at over 70 percent. Overall, banking system
soundness has improved, although weak corporate governance and the prevalence of foreign
currency lending to unhedged borrowers are a concern (Box 1).

Recent performance under the PRGF-supported program has been broadly
satisfactory. The authorities met all the quantitative performance criteria for end-June 2004
(Table 8). The indicative target on the primary balance of the energy sector was missed by a
small margin because of lower-than-expected collection from export sales. Regarding the
implementation of structural reform measures, the energy sector structural performance
criteria as well as two of the four structural benchmarks were delayed (Table 9).

The staff estimates that total factor productivity grew at an average rate of 9.4 percent per year between
2001and 2004 (see Section II of the accompanying Selected Issues paper).

Box 1. Armenia: Financial Sector Soundness and Pending Reforms
Confidence in the banking sector is growing. Following the prolonged phase of bank exits and with bank
supervision now strengthened, years of sluggish intermediation have given way to estimated annual growth
rates of bank deposits and credit to the private sector of 28 percent and 43 percent, respectively, through
September 2004. The latter was driven by consumer lending. Since end-2000, deposit dollarization has fallen
by 5 percentage points to 76 percent and loan dollarization by 10 percentage points to 68 percent.
Further consolidation is likely. Currently there are 19 banks in Armenia-- arguably too large a number
considering that total bank assets and broad money are equivalent to 19 percent and 14 percent of GDP,
respectively. About four banks are likely to fall short of meeting the new minimum capital requirement of
$5 million that becomes effective in mid-2005; this will likely lead to further consolidation (Chart A). Given
that the niche players add little to the system, weeding out a few more small banks would be a positive
development.
In the event of adverse shocks, capital cushions could prove inadequate for some banks. Partly
reflecting the prevalence of dollar lending to un-hedged borrowers, nonperforming loan (NPL) ratios have
been large and volatile, prompting banks to maintain generous capital buffers (Chart A). With large
exposures having traditionally been twice as problematic as small exposures, the new emphasis on consumer
lending may augur well for asset quality. The staff has run a credit risk stress test in which: (i) each bank’s
largest single customer exposure is assumed to go bad; and (ii) a varying percentage of other standard loans
is assumed to migrate to the loss category (Chart B). The results indicate that the largest-customer failure
plus a 10 percent loan migration as described above would cause four banks to fall below the minimum
required CAR of 12 percent, including three banks that account for about 10 percent of the deposit base each.
A Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) update planned for early 2005 will look at future
reforms. Key areas will include: (i) corporate governance in both the banking and the non-financial sectors;
(ii) financial reporting by companies to facilitate a shift away from collateral-based lending; (iii) bank
supervision and bank resolution techniques; and (iv) transparency and efficiency in the judicial system. In
parallel, the authorities are seeking to attract a second international bank in order to increase competition and
bring new technologies into the system.

The performance criteria on the adoption of regulations for contracting electricity and
removing the state-owned company Armenergo from the energy sector were implemented in
October. The design of the regulations to enable direct contracting took longer than expected,
which in turn delayed the decision on Armenergo.19 The structural benchmark on the
initiation of a VAT deferral system for capital goods was implemented in September while
the one on the system of tax audits is expected to be implemented in November.20
IV. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
20.
The discussions focused on: (i) performance under the program and the ex post
assessment of Armenia’s long-term use of Fund resources (EPA); (ii) economic policies for
the near-term; (iii) macro-relevant structural measures to sustain growth and foster poverty
reduction, which are the key challenges ahead; and (iv) the medium-term economic outlook.
A. Ex Post Assessment and Review Discussions
21.
Since 1994, the Fund has provided almost continuous financial assistance to
Armenia. Given Armenia’s long-term program engagement with the Fund, and considering
that the current three-year PRGF arrangement (2001–04) is coming to an end, the staff has
prepared an ex post assessment (EPA) of Fund involvement in the country. On balance, the
EPA views the engagement positively and provides useful insights on the way forward
(Box 2).
22.
The authorities were in broad agreement with the conclusions and
recommendations of the ex post assessment. They stressed that Fund-supported programs
helped promote internal dialogue as well as structured and effective policy implementation.
The authorities acknowledged that implementation of some structural measures—in
particular those pertaining to the energy sector and tax and customs administration—suffered
from delays and/or deficient implementation. They attributed these problems to the role of
vested interests in resisting reforms and undermining program ownership. Nonetheless, the
authorities stressed that slow progress in raising the tax-to-GDP ratio also stemmed from
strong growth in tax-exempted sectors and that those exemptions were fostering growth or
resulted from agreements with foreign donors.

19

Armenergo was in charge of wholesale operations in the midstream sector. The staff had urged the authorities
to liquidate Armenergo because of concerns about the quality of its management and its role in generating
quasi-fiscal losses and distorting the electricity market. The decision on Armenergo reflects the fact that market
rules were needed before the company could cease to intermediate transactions in the sector. The authorities are
requesting a waiver for the nonobservance of these performance criteria.

20

Drafts of a new audit manual and audit reform legislation have already been prepared.

Box 2. Assessment of Longer-Term Program Engagement: Key Points and Lessons
The Fund engagement with Armenia since 1994 has been beneficial. The country’s economic performance
compares favorably with similar countries in the region and the record of implementation of reforms is
satisfactory. Program design and conditionality were on balance appropriate and many program objectives
were met. Implementation was not without slippages, however, particularly during the 1999–2001 period.
The different programs helped to establish macroeconomic stability, reform key quasi-fiscal sectors, and
set the stage for the development of an efficient treasury and a more stable banking system. Nonetheless,
efforts to develop a well-functioning tax system and foster financial intermediation have been less
successful, highlighting the need for increased ownership in these areas.
The main conclusions from the assessment are as follows:
•

A higher degree of political commitment is required to address pending problems in the areas of
tax and customs administration, the banking system, and governance in general.

•

Continued Fund engagement would be beneficial and facilitate political support to consolidate the
reform process, although lower financing needs point to a low-access type of arrangement.

•

A successor arrangement could continue to provide a useful signaling role, build further capacity,
and address remaining reforms in the areas of Fund competency.

•

An eventual new program should target macro-critical areas and seek evidence of strong
commitment to carry out the remaining reforms.

•

An exit from PRGF support is envisaged after a potential successor arrangement. During the next
three years, Armenia’s income level is likely to exceed International Development Association
(IDA) thresholds, the financing gap will probably diminish, and the reform agenda in the areas of
Fund competence should be completed.

23.
Looking ahead, the authorities expressed interest in a successor arrangement.
The ex post assessment suggests a low-access PRGF, but the most recent balance of
payments projections point to somewhat higher financing needs (Table 6).21 The authorities
expressed reservations about the suggestion in the ex post assessment that a hiatus between
the present program and a successor PRGF-arrangement may be needed to ensure enough
ownership of the remaining reform agenda. As the reform momentum slowed down earlier
this year, the staff pointed out the risks of complacency and urged the authorities to put the
common good above the influence of vested interests. Recognizing the need to demonstrate
greater commitment to reform in certain areas, the authorities expressed their determination
to invigorate the reform agenda in the coming months (Attachments I and II).

21

The level of access would be determined at the appropriate time taking account of updated projections for
external financing.

- 14 -

B. Near-Term Economic Policies
Fiscal policy
24.
The staff advised the authorities to maintain a balance between current and
capital expenditures in the 2005 budget. While the authorities’ MTEF for 2005–07 targets
a prudent fiscal deficit of 2 percent of GDP, it envisages sizable increases in current
expenditures (including social expenditures), and much smaller increases in capital
expenditures. The staff urged the authorities to rebalance budget priorities and allocate
additional capital expenditures to PRSP priorities such as transport, agriculture, water, and
housing. At the same time, the staff suggested that some current expenditure could be
rationalized, and recommended that the pace of increase in current social spending could
usefully be tied to improvements in capacity, efficiency, and transparency in the respective
sectors.
25.
Understandings were reached on a budget framework for 2005, which is broadly
in line with the PRSP. On the revenue side, tax revenues are targeted to increase by at least
0.4 percent of GDP based on forthcoming tax reforms (see Section C below).22 This increase,
while appearing optimistic when compared to past outcomes, seems feasible given the
sizable slack in tax administration. On the expenditure side, some savings are envisaged in
domestic interest payments and subsidies, while current expenditures on health, education,
and social security are projected to

increase by 1 percent of GDP (Table 10).

22

The higher tax revenues are based on expected improvements in administration, forthcoming changes in the
coverage and rate structure of the simplified tax (Attachment II, Table 2), and the effect of the recently
introduced the minimum tax on turnover. These measures should yield additional revenues from the simplified
tax, the VAT, and the profit tax.

23

Armenia has qualified for grant disbursements from the Millennium Challenge Account and could receive
grants totaling 2–3 percent of GDP during the next three years.

- 15 -

26.
The projected fiscal stance is
compatible with macroeconomic stability.
The fiscal deficit in 2005 is projected at
2.3 percent of GDP, which is a somewhat
looser stance compared to the estimated outturn
for 2004 and is explained by the higher social
and infrastructure spending. The projected
amount of domestic financing (0.5 percent of
GDP) is consistent with a monetary program
based on 14.5 percent money growth and a
further accumulation of international reserves.

Monetary policy
27.
The stance of monetary policy is appropriate and will be supported by increased
use of domestic instruments. Growing confidence in the banking system should contribute
to further increases in money demand and greater financial intermediation. At the same time,
the central bank intends to maintain a prudent monetary policy to achieve its annual inflation
objective of 3 percent. In addition, and to ensure that the recent increase in credit growth
remains sustainable, the staff encouraged the authorities to carefully monitor lending
practices and the quality of loan portfolios. Given the still limited array of indirect
instruments of monetary policy, the staff welcomed the central bank’s efforts to augment its
stock of government securities as this will allow for their use in open market operations.24
C. Structural Reforms
28.
The authorities agreed on the need to invigorate the reform momentum by proceeding
with the implementation of pending reforms under the PRGF-supported program and
formulating a plan of action for the next few months. The discussions focused on reforms in
the areas of tax and customs administration, expenditure management, the banking system,
the energy and water sectors, and governance.
Fiscal reforms
29.
The authorities expressed broad agreement with the staff recommendations to
tackle weaknesses in tax administration (Box 3). They agreed on the need to enhance the
operations of the large taxpayers unit and ensure the wide use of risk-based approaches to
auditing, VAT refunds, and arrears collection. In this regard, the authorities prepared in
October a draft two-year program of priority reforms to improve efficiency and revamp the
organizational structure of the tax service in line with recent advice from the Fund’s Fiscal
Affairs Department. The program contemplates legislative changes to facilitate effective tax
audits, prevent further accumulation of VAT refunds arrears,25 and write-offs from the books
24

The mission also suggested to revisit the central bank’s standing facilities. The deposit facility does not
extend beyond 14 days and interest rates paid on it are too low to attract funds from the banking system.

25

The bookkeeping of VAT refunds is cumbersome and has led to claims that amounted to 1.3 percent of GDP
at end-December 2003. However, a large part of this amount is related to mistakes, companies that are no

- 16 -

illegitimate refund claims and unrecoverable tax arrears.26 While the intended reforms are
appropriate, some implementation dates are not ambitious enough. Lastly, to ensure the
success of these reforms, the staff advised the authorities to unify the tax and customs
agencies under the umbrella of the Ministry of Finance. However, there is no consensus
within the government about this particular step.
30.
Similar to tax administration, the authorities need to combat discretion and
improve transparency at customs. They should press ahead with the implementation of the
remaining reforms, namely increasing further the use of declared transaction values in
assessing customs duties and VAT, following risk-based methods for inspection and
post-clearance verification of imports, and allowing for the submission of import declarations
to be based on self-assessment. As they finalize the above-mentioned program of tax
reforms, the authorities could usefully include in the program priority reforms in the area of
customs administration.
31.
The staff encouraged the authorities to ensure the efficient and transparent
allocation of higher social and infrastructure spending. This requires the close monitoring
of recent decentralization measures and capacity building. A large portion of Armenia’s
social spending is now channeled through government-owned “noncommercial
organizations.”27 With World Bank support, the authorities are expected to take additional
steps to fully restore financial reporting and accountability for these organizations.28, 29 In the
context of forthcoming assistance under the U.S. Millennium Challenge Account, the
authorities are developing a plan for additional investments in transportation, water and
irrigation, and agriculture.

longer in operation, and invalid claims. The authorities intend to clear their books within the next few months
and repay the outstanding stock of claims to exporters by mid-2006. They are also committed to prevent the
further accumulations of arrears.
26

In mid-2004, the stock of tax arrears from companies was equivalent to 5 percent of GDP. However, only
about 0.5 percent of GDP is believed to be recoverable, and the authorities expect to collect this amount during
the next two years. The bulk of the stock is deemed unrecoverable as it corresponds to nonexistent or nearly
bankrupt companies and will therefore be written off.

27

In early 2003, about 5000 budgetary organizations (nearly 15 percent of the budget) were given a different
legal status as part of a wide decentralization reform. However, these entities (mainly schools and hospitals)
were not subject to sufficient auditing and reporting procedures, rendering their activities less transparent.

28

Some measures to restore financial reporting and accountability in government-owned organizations that
were formerly part of the central government budget have been introduced under the PRGF-supported program,
but remain to be fully implemented. It is also necessary to establish reporting mechanisms for similar
organizations owned by local governments.

29

Fund and World Bank staff coordinate their activities in these and other areas. Fund staff takes the lead on
macroeconomic policy issues, budget formulation and execution, quasi-fiscal deficits, tax reforms, debt
management, and statistics. Areas of shared responsibility include financial sector, customs, and energy sector
reforms. The Bank takes the lead on PRSP-related issues including social spending allocations, poverty and
labor market analysis, public expenditure reforms, health and education reforms, decentralization, procurement
and financial accountability assessments, anti-corruption, trade and transportation, judicial reform, business
environment, rural infrastructure, civil service reform, and water and irrigation sector reforms.

- 17 -

Box 3. Armenia’s Tax System: Status and Staff Recommendations
Weaknesses in tax administration remain the main constraint to revenue collection. A large gap
between actual and potential collection is evidence of Armenia’s tax revenue potential. Tax
administration reforms during the last two years focused on setting up the operations of the large
taxpayers unit, putting in place codes of conduct and internal audit units in the tax and customs
agencies, disseminating tax laws and regulations, and enhancing the authority of the tax service to
collect arrears. This, however, has not been accompanied by organizational improvements and the
effective implementation of laws and regulations. The large taxpayers unit collects just 23 percent of
total revenues, while it could potentially collect up to 75 percent. Discretionary behavior and
organizational deficiencies within the tax service, and creative accounting practices by companies all
contribute to this disappointing performance. Looking ahead, the staff has recommended specific
steps to revamp the internal organization of the tax service and implement risk-based systems for
audit and administration of VAT refunds. A similar set of recommendations applies to customs
operations. In addition, both tax and customs should be brought under the control of the Ministry of
Finance in order to improve coordination and ensure consistency between policies and
administration.
While improving tax administration should be the top priority, there is also room to improve
tax policy environment. Armenia’s tax system is generally well designed and characterized by low
and uniform rates. The main tax policy reforms in the last two years focused on reducing VAT
exemptions on imports and improving legislation to limit the erosion of the tax base. In the mediumterm, the authorities will need to streamline a number of overlapping taxes which lead to a
fragmentation of the tax base. First, there is a simplified tax intended for small taxpayers which has
lower rates than the regular tax regime (profit, income, and value-added taxes). However, it has
provided incentives for the fragmentation of large businesses that take advantage of its lower rates
and switch between regimes to minimize tax liabilities. Second, presumptive taxes on certain
products were introduced in the mid-1990s because of administrative difficulties in covering them
with the regular regime. There will soon be scope to begin covering these activities with the VAT.
Third, a rather complex set of laws and regulations has emerged in recent years highlighting the
importance of compiling a unified tax code. Fourth, the remaining VAT exemptions on imports of
selected intermediate inputs and capital goods (equivalent to about 15 percent of total imports)
should be removed, as they undermine the integrity of the tax system, distort price signals, and
create an uneven playing field among importers. Lastly, the authorities need to ensure that the profit
tax holiday for foreign investments is not renewed beyond its expiration in 2007.

Banking system
32.
The authorities need to proceed with additional financial sector reforms to foster
financial intermediation. The staff welcomed the central bank’s plans to improve corporate
governance in banks and strengthen creditors’ rights by streamlining the collateral
registration and recovery process. The authorities agreed on the need to improve financial
reporting by firms and governance in the judicial system. Lastly, the authorities need to
follow up on recent recommendations from the Monetary and Financial Systems Department
to improve the financial market infrastructure and develop new financial instruments.
33.
The central bank unveiled plans to fine-tune banking supervision. It is
considering enhancements to the risk weights used to compute capital adequacy ratios and a
tightening of exposure limits. The staff views these proposals as broadly appropriate and
pointed to the upcoming FSAP update as an opportunity to discuss them in detail. A number
of banks have been lobbying for a relaxation of criteria to fulfill the new minimum capital

- 18 -

requirement of US$5 million that will become effective in mid-2005. The staff urged the
authorities to take a strict approach to enforce the new capital requirements.
34.
The staff highlighted the advantages of deepening the domestic debt market. The
domestic debt-to-GDP ratio remains below 3 percent and the government securities market is
thin and lacks liquidity. The staff encouraged the authorities to deepen the debt market by
issuing more government bonds not just to improve monetary management but also to foster
the creation of a yield curve, tap domestic savings more aggressively, and provide a platform
for private debt issues. The authorities agreed, but they are likely to proceed in a gradual way
because the Ministry of Finance is concerned about the costs and risks of over-funding the
budget at this time.
Quasi-Fiscal Sectors
35.
The energy sector is reaching the last stage of reforms. Since 2002, privatization
and other reforms led to a substantial transformation of the sector. Losses arising from
technical deficiencies and theft have fallen, collection rates have increased to nearly
100 percent, and the primary balance has gone from deficit to surplus. The recent removal of
Armenergo from transactions in the energy sector allows for direct contracting between the
distribution company, the generation companies, and the dispatch companies, thereby
reducing quasi-fiscal losses and opportunities for graft. Despite some delays, the authorities
approved in October the minimal regulatory framework governing market mechanisms for
electricity trading as envisaged under

plan approved in November 2003.
36.
Although reforms in the water and irrigation sectors have been progressing,
more needs to be done to improve efficiency and ensure these sectors’ financial
viability. The primary deficits in these sectors have declined in recent years, but there are
still problems with technical losses and theft. In addition, the pace of tariff increases should
be stepped up as planned to reach cost-recovery by 2007. Lastly, the authorities need to
develop the water infrastructure and improve efficiency and accountability in the users’
associations that are now in charge of managing the irrigation networks.
Governance
37.
The staff encouraged the authorities to accelerate the implementation of the
government’s anti-corruption strategy. In June 2004, a high-level council was created to
implement the strategy. The council, in turn, created a monitoring committee with civil
society and parliamentary representation. The staff encouraged the authorities to move ahead

- 19 -

with the three-year strategy which included measures to harmonize legislation on sanctions
for corruption and witness protection, reduce corruption in the tax and customs agencies,
build an independent judiciary, introduce financial audit standards in the public sector, and
strengthen the role of parliament in the audit process. While the authorities expressed their
intention to implement the strategy, it is yet unclear whether there is enough ownership
within the government to do so.
Technical Assistance and Data Issues
38.
The authorities expressed satisfaction with the substantial amount of technical
assistance provided by the Fund during the last two years (Appendix II). While the assistance
has been broadly effective, there have been some delays and inefficiencies in implementing
the respective recommendations. These shortcomings can be attributed to capacity
constraints and, in certain areas, insufficient ownership. Future needs involve national
accounts methodology and details on the implementation of forthcoming tax administration
and banking reforms. The latter will be prioritized after the FSAP update planned for early
2005.
39.
The quality and timeliness of economic and social statistics have improved
significantly over the past three years, although real sector, fiscal, and balance of payments
data require further enhancements (Appendix V). Armenia subscribes to the Special Data
Dissemination Standard, and the data provided to the Fund are generally adequate for
surveillance and program monitoring.
D. Medium-Term Outlook
40.
Armenia faces four key medium-term policy challenges to sustain high growth
rates and reduce poverty. First, forthcoming budgets and the medium-term expenditure
framework need to preserve macroeconomic stability, improve fiscal transparency, and focus
on PRSP priorities on social and infrastructure spending, including in rural areas. Second, the
authorities should revamp tax and customs administration and foster a level playing field
among taxpayers. This will improve the environment for private sector activity and will
generate additional revenues to finance poverty-reducing and growth-enhancing
expenditures. Third, there is a need to complete legislative reforms to foster financial sector
development and improve corporate governance in banks. Higher financial intermediation
will channel resources to new companies and investments. Fourth, corruption should be
tackled more forcefully and the judicial system should function more efficiently and
transparently.
41.
Assuming a consistent reform effort, Armenia’s medium-term economic outlook
envisages fast growth, low inflation, and robust fiscal and external positions (Table 11).
Growth should be supported by further improvements in the business environment. The

(PRSP).30 To guide the future allocation of
development funds, the staff encouraged the authorities to develop a well-prioritized public
investment program. The authorities, citing capacity constraints, were noncommittal.

V. STAFF APPRAISAL
42.
Armenia’s economy has performed remarkably well during the last three years.
Prudent financial policies, structural reforms, and external financial support contributed to
double-digit economic growth, low inflation, declining fiscal, quasi-fiscal, and external
imbalances, and poverty reduction. Most of the targets in the PRGF-supported program were
met, although some structural reforms suffered from delays or deficient implementation.
43.
The authorities are well-positioned to continue with their prudent macroeconomic
policies. They are expected to maintain a cautious fiscal stance and ensure that the
expenditure envelope is in line with PRSP priorities on infrastructure spending. The
projected fiscal deficit of about 2 percent of GDP is consistent with economic stability and
debt sustainability. The staff encourages the authorities to continue rationalizing nonpriority
current expenditures and proceed with the envisaged higher allocation for capital
expenditures in the draft 2005 budget. Lastly, a comprehensive medium-term public
investment program based on sound project selection criteria should be prepared. Such a
program is needed to complement medium-term expenditure frameworks and guide future
external assistance.

Further financing could be provided by the EBRD and the Armenian diaspora.

44.
The current stance of monetary policy aimed at lowering inflation to 3 percent by
year-end is appropriate. The gradual deepening of the government debt market will facilitate
monetary management and eventually provide a platform for private debt issues.
45.
Armenia’s flexible exchange rate has lent autonomy to monetary policy and
facilitated the adjustment of the economy to external shocks. On the backdrop of a sizable
improvement in competitiveness and lower debt ratios since 2001, the recent appreciation of
the dram is a welcomed development as it facilitates the natural adjustment of the real
exchange rate and offsets the impact of higher import prices on inflation.
46.
Notwithstanding the progress made so far, certain structural reforms need to be
completed to sustain growth and achieve further poverty reduction. The priorities should be
strengthening tax and customs administration, improving expenditure management,
deepening banking sector reforms, completing energy and water sector reforms, and adopting
a vigorous approach to resist corruption and vested interests.
47.
Despite improvements in recent years, the administration of tax and customs remains
weak because of managerial and organizational shortcomings. In this regard, the staff
welcomes the authorities’ draft of a two-year plan of priority reforms in these areas and urges
them to advance the calendar for implementation of such reforms as well as to include in the
plan key measures to improve customs administration. In addition, tax and customs
operations should be brought under the control of the Ministry of Finance. Lastly, the staff
welcomes the authorities’ plan to simplify the tax system and compile a unified tax code, and
encourages the authorities to eliminate the remaining VAT exemptions on imports.
48.
The much-needed steps to improve fiscal transparency in state-owned noncommercial
organizations are just beginning to yield results. Given the importance of these organizations
within the budget and PRSP priorities, the authorities should intensify the monitoring and
auditing of these organizations to ensure that their capacity, accountability, and potential for
results are good enough to justify increasingly generous budget allocations.
49.
The banking system has strengthened during the last two years, and the authorities are
developing a strategy to foster financial intermediation. After years of stagnation in credit to
the private sector, the staff welcomes the recent increase and encourages the authorities to
press ahead with their plans to strengthen prudential norms, improve corporate governance in
banks, streamline collateral recovery procedures, and improve court processes.
50.
Notwithstanding improvements in recent years, more work remains to be done on the
quasi-fiscal sectors and on governance. Reforms in the energy sector need to be completed
through further privatization and settlement of pending debts. As the water and irrigation
sectors have lagged behind, it is now important to proceed with plans to increase water tariffs
toward cost-recovery levels and strengthen the water infrastructure with the support of the
World Bank. Regarding governance, the implementation of the recently prepared anticorruption strategy needs to be stepped up and complemented with appropriate penalties for
abuse and an efficient and independent judicial system.

- 22 -

51.
Armenia’s economic outlook is favorable, but it is not without risks. The most
important risks are on the domestic front, where intermittent political turmoil and insufficient
resolve to deal with problems in tax collection and strengthen the legal, judiciary, and
banking systems could damage growth prospects and impede a meaningful reduction in
poverty rates. Effective political leadership will be required to fight corruption and vested
interests and counterbalance these risks. In addition, the external position remains vulnerable
as a result of the unresolved conflict with Azerbaijan, the trade blockade by Turkey, and
limited export diversification. Lastly, Armenia’s dependence on grants and foreign financing
means that any disruptions in their disbursements could have an adverse effect on fiscal and
macroeconomic stability. This reinforces the importance of building a domestic revenue base
and deepening financial markets.
52.
The authorities agreed with the thrust of the ex post assessment of past
Fund-supported programs and expressed interest in a successor PRGF arrangement. A Fundsupported program could play a useful role in completing Armenia’s reform agenda in the
areas of Fund competence, but political resolve at the highest levels of government will be
required to ensure the proper implementation of ongoing and pending reforms.
53.
Given Armenia’s good overall performance under the program and the recent
implementation of the structural performance criteria on the energy sector originally
scheduled for end-July 2004, the staff supports the authorities’ request of a waiver for the
nonobservance of these conditions and recommends the completion of the sixth and final
review under the PRGF arrangement.
54.
Armenia’s data are generally adequate for surveillance and program monitoring. It is
proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Armenia be held in accordance with the
provision of the Executive Board Decision No. 12854-(02/96), 9-/12/02.

Sources: Ministry of Finance and Economy, Central Bank of Armenia, and Fund staff estimates.
1/ For better comparability, the composition of expenditures for 2001–03 have been adjusted to reflect changes in expenditure categories
brought about by the reclassification of budgetary institutions as non-commercial enterprises in 2003 and the reclassification of public order
and safety wages previously classified in goods and services.
2/ Includes expenditure authorized by the supplementary budget, but not included in the original program.
3/ The projected increase in 2005 is mostly due to the envisaged increases in education and health.
4/ The figure for 2005 includes US$20 million in estimated grant disbursements from the Millenium Challenge Account.
The actual figure will be reflected in the budget after it is confirmed.
5/ The figure for 2003 includes a recapitalization of state-owned water companies amounting to 0.3 percent of GDP.
6/ Excluding external arrears on principal which are included in external financing.
7/ The tax base is estimated as GDP minus 90 percent of the value-added in construction, which is largely tax-exempt due to international
agreements with official and private donors.
8/ Excluding domestic expenditure arrears.

1/ The projected decline in 2005 is related to additional privatization proceeds primarily from the sale of a copper company. These proceeds will be saved in the
special privatization account which is a separate account at the CBA and is subject to regular audit by Parliament. Those proceeds are not reflected in the fiscal
accounts until funds are earmarked for spending within the budget.
2/ At actual exchange rates, excluding the SPA.
3/ At program exchange rates. March and June figures are based on end-December 2003 exchange rates (IMF Country Report No. 04/136, Attachment III, Table 1).
September and December figures are based on end-June exchange rates.
4/ Ratio of foreign currency deposits to total deposits (in percent).

ATTACHMENT I

October 27, 2004
Mr. Rodrigo de Rato
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431
Dear Mr. de Rato:
In May 2001, the Executive Board approved a three-year arrangement for Armenia under the Poverty
Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF). At the time of the fifth review on May 3, 2004, the
arrangement was extended through December 2004 to allow additional time in order to implement
additional reforms in line with the objectives of the arrangement. The purpose of this letter and the
attached Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies is to inform you of the progress in
implementing the program, set out the policies for the period ahead, and request the seventh
disbursement under the arrangement following the completion of the sixth review.
Economic performance in 2004 has been in line with program objectives and all quantitative
performance criteria for end-June 2004 were met. While the structural reforms scheduled for
implementation during the last six months were largely met, some delays occurred in relation to
important fiscal and energy sector measures. These include the adoption of legislation to regulate the
use of cash registers and register traders at large retail markets, the preparatory work to set up a riskbased system of tax audits, and the adoption of regulations for contracting electricity and for
removing the state-owned company Armenergo from the energy sector.
On the basis of completion of the delayed measures and other actions envisaged in the near term and
detailed in the attached Memorandum of Economic Policies, we hereby request the completion of the
last review under the arrangement. We are also requesting a waiver for the nonobservance of the
above-mentioned energy measures (performance criteria for the sixth review), which were delayed
because of technical complications but have been implemented on October 1, 2004.
The government would like to continue its fruitful cooperation with the IMF and would like to
proceed with discussions on a new PRGF arrangement covering the 2005–08 period after the
completion of the sixth review. The policies and measures to be implemented during the next five
months are designed to address more forcefully lingering inefficiencies in tax and customs
administration and pave the way for continued cooperation under a new three-year arrangement. The
government intends to make these understandings public and authorizes the IMF to publish this letter,
the attached memorandum, and the staff report including the ex post assessment of long-term program
engagement with the Fund.
Sincerely yours,
/s/
Andranik Margaryan
Prime Minister
Republic of Armenia

ATTACHMENT II

REPUBLIC OF ARMENIA
Memorandum of Economic Policies
October 27, 2004
1.
This memorandum supplements the Memorandum of Economic and Financial
Policies (MEFP) of April 2003. It updates the government’s policies for 2004 and outlines
the government’s main economic policies for the remainder of 2004 and early 2005.
A. Recent Developments
2.
Economic growth continues at high pace. Real GDP in the first eight months of 2004
expanded by 9.7 percent. The 12-month rate of inflation reached 6.1 percent in September.
Broad money grew by 18.7 percent in the twelve months through August. In the first half of
2004, the outturn of the fiscal deficit on a cash basis was 1 percent of GDP compared to
3.0 percent of GDP under the program, mainly because of under-execution of expenditures.
In June, parliament passed a supplementary budget amounting to an increase of expenditure
by 0.6 percent of GDP. The additional expenditures are expected to be executed during a
12-month period.
3.
We met all but one of the program’s quantitative targets for end-June. The indicative
target on the primary surplus of the energy sector was missed by a small margin because of
somewhat lower-than-expected collection rates from export sales (Table 1). We established
revised targets for up to end-December 2004. While the structural reforms scheduled for
implementation during the last six months were largely met, some delays occurred in relation
to important fiscal and energy sector measures. These include the adoption of legislation to
regulate the use of cash registers and register traders at large retail markets, the initiation of a
deferral system for imports of capital goods, the preparatory work to set up a risk-based
system of tax audits, and the adoption of regulations for contracting electricity and for
removing the company Armenergo from the energy sector. The latter was delayed because of
technical complications in devising market rules and reaching understandings with other
energy market participants. Despite those delays, we have taken actions to ensure that the
measures envisaged in the context of the sixth review of the PRGF-supported program will
be implemented by mid-November 2004.
B. Economic Policies in the Period Ahead
4.
For the rest of 2004 and 2005, our macroeconomic policies will focus on price
stability, a forceful implementation of tax and customs administration reforms, and fiscal
transparency. Some of these policies were listed in the April 2003 memorandum of economic
and financial policies but will be supplemented by additional policies as noted below and
summarized in Tables 1–2.
5.
Fiscal policy. The 2005 budget to be submitted to parliament will be based on
the following key parameters. Domestic tax and nontax revenues will be targeted at

- 38 -

ATTACHMENT II

AMD 313 billion of which tax revenues will be at a minimum of AMD 306 billion,
representing an increase of at least 0.4 percent of GDP from the previous year. The tax
revenue target for 2005 will be adjusted if GDP developments in early 2005 suggest that such
an update is warranted. Current expenditures will be at most AMD 290 billion. At the same
time, we will limit expenditure increases in areas where capacity constraints, transparency, or
the efficiency of expenditure are a concern. To ensure a balanced mix between current and
capital expenditures, capital expenditures excluding net lending and those to be financed
from the Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) will be at least AMD 70 billion. The figure
for capital expenditures will include the carryover of unexecuted expenditures in the 2004
supplementary budget estimated at AMD 4 billion (0.2 percent of GDP). Once assurances are
received regarding support from the MCA, those amounts will be included in the budget as
additional capital expenditure. The overall deficit of the central government (including
grants) will not exceed AMD 47.5 billion, which is a looser stance compared to the estimated
outturn for 2004 but allows for priority social and infrastructure spending increases. Finally,
the 2005 budget document will include detailed information and data on the budget
allocations to noncommercial organizations.
6.
Tax and customs administration. Despite some progress in recent years, tax and
customs administration still suffer from severe deficiencies. The operations of the large
taxpayers unit need to be revamped to improve collection from all large taxpayers and
prevent discretionary treatment of taxpayers. To move forward, a major change in direction
is required to improve efficiency and transparency in these agencies. As a result, we will
finalize, in consultation with Fund staff, a two-year program of priority reforms in the area of
tax policy and on tax and customs administration. The program will include a number of
legislative and managerial changes to revamp tax administration. On the legislative front, we
will enact legislation to facilitate the carrying out of effective tax audits, particularly in
relation to large enterprises. In addition, we will enact legislation to prevent further
accumulation of VAT refund arrears and will discuss with Fund staff amendments to the law
on Bank secrecy to improve compliance with tax payments. On the managerial side, we will
move the tax audit function in the STS to the large taxpayers unit and foster the
implementation of risk-based management approaches in performing audits, collecting
arrears, and processing VAT refunds by the tax and customs agencies.
7.
Regarding the existing stock of VAT excess payments owed to exporters and
domestic suppliers, we will ascertain the legitimate refund claims and remove from the books
the requests of defunct companies, requests that did not follow legislative requirements and
appropriate administrative procedures, and requests deemed fraudulent and therefore
rejected. We will prepare, by end-November 2004, a complete list of legitimate claimants
and amounts owed to each of them. Of the overall stock amounting to AMD 21 billion
accumulated prior to December 31, 2003, we estimate that AMD 5.4 billion is legitimately
owed to exporters. During 2005, we will repay at least AMD 4 billion in equal quarterly
installments, with the remainder to be paid during the first half of 2006. If the legitimate
claims owed to exporters exceed AMD 5.4 billion, we will discuss with Fund staff the
modality for its repayment to ensure that all outstanding claims are fully repaid by June 2006.

At the same time, we will ensure that during 2004 and 2005 there will be no further
accumulations of VAT refund arrears exporters.
8.
Regarding the stock of tax arrears amounting to AMD 89 billion at end-June 2004,
we will take steps to write-off the part of the stock that is non-recoverable in line with recent
technical assistance advice from the Fund including enacting the enabling legislation by
December 2004. We will collect the recoverable amounts owed by current participants of the
tax system, including large enterprises and other active traders and state entities. In
particular, we will assign a high-level taskforce to collect arrears from the largest
100 debtors. The task force will prepare a collection plan for the recoverable amounts with
targets for 2005–06 by December 2004. Of the total recoverable amounts, we expect to
collect at least AMD 4 billion in 2005. Lastly, we will ensure that there are no further
increases in the stock of tax arrears by active state-owned companies, including those in the
energy sector.
9.
To improve the functioning of customs administration, we intend to achieve the
following results in the near term. First, consistent with WTO principles, we will ensure that
declared transaction values are increasingly used for assessing customs duties and VAT and
will begin publishing on our website quarterly information on the use of transactions values.
Second, we will strengthen the operations of the internal audit unit and the post-clearance
verification audit unit and continue preparing audit reports. Third, we will enact the
electronic signature law to make the direct trader input system operational and will conduct a
wide campaign to inform traders and companies at large about the direct trader input system.
Lastly, we will prepare in consultation with Fund and World Bank staff, terms of reference
for an operational review of customs operations to be conducted by a specialized
international company.
10.
Tax policy. We have begun preparatory work to build a unified tax code containing
an internally consistent set of tax laws and regulations. In the near term, the differentiated tax
rate structure in the simplified tax will be replaced with one tax rate on turnover and with no
deductions for expenses, and action will be taken to remove large taxpayers from the
simplified tax regime and move them to the regular regime (VAT and profit tax).
11.
Monetary policy. The Central Bank of Armenia (CBA), with full support of the
government, will continue pursuing a tight monetary policy and will not stand in the way of
an appreciation of the dram in order to ensure that inflation is lowered to its objective of
3 percent. The CBA will follow the current course of increasingly relying on open market
operations in the dram money market for the day-to-day conduct of monetary policy. To
enhance its implementation capacity, the CBA will continue, in cooperation with the
Ministry of Finance and Economy (MFE) to augment its holdings of government securities
for use both in direct sales and as collateral in repurchase contracts. To facilitate liquidity
management and to develop the domestic debt market, the MFE will increase the aggregate
face value of its dram-denominated securities stock by at least 6 billion in 2005.

- 40 -

ATTACHMENT II

12.
Banking system reforms. The CBA will continue to improve the regulatory
framework for commercial banks. The new minimum capital requirement of US$5 million
will become effective July 1, 2005, with eligible capital to remain as is currently defined.
Banks that fail to meet prudential requirements will be promptly liquidated or converted into
nonbank credit organizations. Bank consolidation and new shareholder entry will be
encouraged and leading banks with well-established international track record will be given
preference in awarding new licenses. By end-2004, the CBA will amend its system of risk
weights, making it consistent with Basel Committee recommendations under the
standardized approach, and will tighten related-party exposure and large exposure limits.
Finally, by end-March 2005, the Civil Code will be amended to further support creditor
rights in relation to collateral registration and recovery, and the Civil Procedures Code will
be amended to improve court processes governing these rights.
13.
Energy sector reforms. As of October 1, 2004, Armenergo has been extricated from
all cash and non-cash transactions and is prevented from making any new contracts in the
energy sector. By end-November 2004, we will establish, according to the law, a liquidation
commission to conduct a fair and transparent liquidation process, a process that would
include the sale of assets, the collection of receivables and the payment of debt according to
priority rules, and finally, the appropriate handling of remaining Armenergo staff. The
commission will consist of experts and trusted appointees who have no interests and no
involvement in the energy sector. By end-March 2005, an audit of the company for the year
2004 will be undertaken, and as standard practice, another audit will be conducted at the end
of the liquidation. Subsequently, all of Armenergo’s outstanding liabilities to the government
will be written off, it’s remaining debt restructured, and the company’s removal from the
enterprise registry will be initiated through the court system. In addition, the Public Services
Regulatory Commission will pass the remaining elements of market rules including rules
governing export sales and swaps to ensure the proper functioning and transparency in the
energy sector.
14.
The government believes that the policies and measures described in this
memorandum are adequate, but it stands ready to take any additional measures that may be
required to ensure the success of the intended reforms. The government will continue
consulting with the Fund in advance of the adoption of any new policies and will provide the
Fund with the information required to assess progress in implementing its program.

Outcomes
Objectives achieved. Real economic growth averaged 12 percent per
year during 2001–03, income per capita rose by 48 percent and
consumption per capita rose by 39 percent. The poverty rate fell from
56 percent in 1999 to 43 percent in 2003.
Objectives achieved. The nominal exchange rate has been broadly
stable and average annual inflation was 3.8 percent between mid-2001
and mid-2004. Between 2000 and 2003, the general government
deficit fell from 6.4 percent of GDP to 1.1 percent and the current
account deficit fell from 15 percent of GDP to 7 percent. Foreign
exchange reserves remained at over 3.5 months of imports.
Objectives achieved. During 2001–03, exports of goods and services
grew at an average rate of 27 percent per year and the external debtto-exports ratio fell from 139 percent to 87 percent.
Capacity constraints, discretionary behavior of collection agencies,
exemptions, and influence of vested interests hindered progress in this
area. There has been a gradual improvement in tax and customs
administration during 2001–03 and tax exemptions were partially
removed, but implementation has been deficient. Tax policy changes
have been compromised by the influence of vested interests, and
transparency of customs operation remains a concern.
Objectives broadly achieved. The treasury system was strengthened
and expenditure control procedures were put in place. Domestic and
external arrears were cleared in 2003 and unclassified expenditures
fell from 15.6 percent of total expenditures in 2000 to 0.8 percent in
2003. At present, about 15 percent of the budget is allocated to
noncommercial organizations that were recently separated from the
treasury. The move represented a loss of control and accountability for
the use of public funds. The problem is beginning to be addressed
through a new reporting system and related reforms.
Objectives broadly achieved. Prudential regulations were
strengthened, a loan classification system was put in place, minimum
capital requirements were raised, and eight problem banks were
resolved. The resolution process for these banks could have been more
expeditious to ensure a faster recovery of confidence in the system.
Weak governance in banks and enforcement of creditor rights remain
a concern.
Objectives broadly achieved. A number of companies have been
privatized, collection rates rose, efficiency improved, and quasi-fiscal
losses have been substantially reduced. Further privatization of stateowned energy and gas companies is needed.
The business environment has improved. License procedures were
simplified, internal audit functions were set up in the treasury and in
the tax and customs services, a new criminal code was adopted, and a
program of dissemination of laws and regulations was put in place.
However, much more remains to be done to deal with corruption,
particularly in customs and the judiciary.

VII. Safeguards Assessment
Under the Fund’s safeguards assessment policy, the Central Bank of Armenia (CBA) is
subject to a full safeguards assessment with respect to the PRGF arrangement approved
on May 23, 2001. The safeguards assessment of the CBA, completed on February 19,
2002, found the safeguards at the CBA to be generally adequate to ensure the integrity of
bank resources, including Fund disbursements. However, the assessment noted a number
of vulnerabilities and proposed specific measures to address the weaknesses. The CBA
has implemented all the measures recommended.
VIII. Exchange Rate Arrangement
(a)

On November 22, 1993, the Republic of Armenia introduced its national currency, the
dram, at a rate of 200 Armenian rubles per dram. The exchange rate has been allowed to
float since then with minimal intervention by the central bank. The official exchange rate
is quoted daily as a weighted average of the previous day’s interbank exchange rates.

- 45 -

(b)

APPENDIX II

Armenia maintains no exchange restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for
current international transactions except for exchange restrictions maintained for security
reasons, and notified to the Fund pursuant to Executive Board Decision No. 144-(52/51).

IX. Article IV Consultations
The 2002 Article IV consultation with Armenia was concluded on September 25, 2002.
Armenia is subject to the 24-month consultation cycle.
X.

FSAP Participation and ROSCs
A joint World Bank-International Monetary Fund mission assessed Armenia’s
financial sector as part of the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) during
September 6–22, 2000. The Financial Sector Stability Assessment (FSSA) report was
discussed at the Board on May 14, 2001, together with the 2001 Article IV staff report.
The authorities have made progress in implementing the FSAP recommendations.
Outstanding issues that need to be addressed include several legislative and regulatory
shortfalls and the need for enactment of the legal protection for supervisory authorities.
An FSAP update is scheduled to be conducted during this financial year.

APPENDIX III

ARMENIA: RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK
(As of October 13, 2004)
Country Director: Donna Dowsett-Coirolo

Telephone: (202) 473-0121

I. Implementation of Structural Reform Measures
A. Legal Framework
The Armenian government has established the core legal framework necessary for private
sector operations, including the Civil Procedure Code, the Procurement law, the Business
Registration law and the Public Auction law. The fully restructured and enacted Bankruptcy
law is now harmonized with the Civil Code and the Civil Procedure Code, and strengthens
the enforcement mechanisms for bankruptcy procedures. The Concession law has been
enacted and the National Assembly has adopted a new Labor Code, which is compatible with
the requirements of a market economy and is an important instrument of flexible jobcreation.
B. Business Environment
The government has made satisfactory progress in removing administrative barriers for
business and investment and has strengthened the consultative mechanisms with the business
community. The steps taken include, inter alia, consolidating, downsizing, and clarifying
mandates of various government inspections; enacting the new law on business registration;
streamlining licensing procedures; issuing new accounting recommendations for small and
medium-sized enterprises; establishing a regulatory framework that allows privatization of
urban land by business entities; and adopting simplified procedures for obtaining site
development and construction permits. The capacity of the Armenian Development Agency
as a focal point for government’s efforts to promote investment and exports as well as for
identifying the remaining bottlenecks in the business environment has been strengthened.
The functioning of the Business Council has been improved and the private sector’s
awareness of its activities has been enhanced.
The recent business surveys of the Armenian entrepreneurs during 2002 and 2003, suggest
that these efforts have already resulted in a more positive private sector perception of the
business and investment environment. For example, the average time necessary to get
construction and building renovation permits was reduced from 310 days in 2001 to 76 days
in 2003. The number of goods subject to mandatory certification at the border was reduced
from 80 in 2001 to 60 in 2003. The number of registered joint ventures increased by
25 percent from January 1, 2002 to November 1, 2003, and the FDI (outside the energy
sector) increased by 44 percent in the first nine months of 2003 compared with a similar
period in 2002. The State Customs Committee’s websites became operational and during
2003, on average 467 references per month were made to it. Despite these improvements,
there is still considerable scope for further reforms in the areas of competition, deregulation
and strengthening of business and investment climate, especially in commercial debt

- 48 -

APPENDIX III

recovery procedures, improvements in the transparency and efficiency of the judicial system,
tax and customs administrations, improvements in governance and implementing the
anti-corruption strategy.
C. Energy and Infrastructure
Since its privatization in the second half of 2002, the Electricity Distribution Company has
remained in compliance with its licenses agreement as confirmed by making full payments to
the generation and service providers, reporting to the regulator on a timely basis, and
submitting investment plan to the regulator. The government has also made satisfactory
efforts to improve the legal and regulatory framework in the energy sector in order to
establish a supportive environment for the new private operator. Budget allocations have
been increased to ensure full payments to the energy sector by the budgetary organizations
and public utilities. Despite this satisfactory performance, continued efforts are crucial for
improvements in the energy sector through restructuring the midstream companies and
strengthening the regulatory framework to ensure adequate functioning, transparency, and
reliability of this sector.
There has been limited progress in improving fiscal discipline and reducing losses in the
irrigation and water sectors. The World Bank has been working with the government to:
(i) upgrade the management capacity of public companies in these sectors; (ii) ensure a
gradual increase in tariffs to cost recovery; (iii) provide additional investments to improve
technical efficiency; and (iv) ensure that the budget provides adequate financing for water
consumed by public sector entities. The government has adopted the medium-term
Infrastructure Rehabilitation Plan to provide further guidelines for restructuring in water,
irrigation, and public transportation. To provide full cost recovery, the government has
adopted a schedule for irrigation tariff increase in 2002–07 in order to achieve full cost
recovery in the irrigation system by 2007.
E. Education and Health
The government implemented a major rationalization program during the 2003 school year.
As a result, 37 schools were merged or closed and about 3,500 teachers were made
redundant. The medium-term action plan for improving the financial management,
accounting, and financial reporting for higher education institutions was adopted by the
government on January 26, 2003. Accountants at the higher institutions have been trained
and special software has been prepared for use. Since the second quarter of 2003, the new
accounting procedures are being used. The government increased the state budget allocation
for primary and secondary education and improved teachers’ salaries. The government also
developed an action plan and cleared arrears in the education sector and prevented further
arrears in this sector. Despite these improvements, there is scope for further reforms in
education, including adoption of new curricula for secondary education, enhancement of
standards for higher education to make it more responsive to employers’ needs, improving
preschool systems, and strengthening monitoring and financial reporting of the
noncommercial organizations (NCOs) in the education sector.

- 49 -

APPENDIX III

The government adopted the hospital master plan for Yerevan in late 2002. As a result, the
remaining public hospitals in Yerevan were to be merged into smaller number of hospital
networks with necessary steps to be taken to restructure them. The government adopted a
decree on November 21, 2003, identifying the configuration of ten hospital networks through
consolidation of twenty-four public hospitals and thirteen outpatient health care institutions.
Directors for nine of these hospital networks have been appointed. While the hospital merger
process is being implemented, introduction of further appropriate adjustments may be
required. The medium-term action plan for improving financial management accounting and
reporting for the public hospitals was adopted by the government on September 14, 2003, to
prepare new reporting and accounting procedures and cost accounting manuals.
Implementation progress has been satisfactory and about 200 hospital accountants have been
trained in new accounting procedures. The government developed an action plan for clearing
the accumulated arrears in the health sector and prevented further arrears in this sector. The
government also adopted a Decision to introduce further reforms in the Basic Benefit
Package in the health sector. Further reforms are needed in increasing the population overall
health status, reducing child and maternal mortality, increasing use of healthcare system by
rural and low-income groups, monitoring public health and promoting better health behavior,
and strengthening monitoring and financial reporting of the noncommercial organizations
(NCOs) in the health sector.
F. Social Protection and Insurance
Since 1999, the government has been replacing a range of fragmented cash and non-cash
benefits and privileges with better-targeted transfers to families. The government completed
several important steps to enhance its capacity for administration of transfers to families,
including: (i) re-registration of poverty benefit recipients; (ii) beneficiary assessment of the
existing benefits; and (iii) establishment of a central database for poverty benefit recipients.
Data from the recent household survey suggest that the system of benefits and transfers to the
poor has become an efficient instrument for reducing extreme poverty. Continued efforts are
needed to ensure the adequacy of the level and administrative capacity of the social
protection systems to guarantee coverage of transfers to people with special needs.
The law on Public Pension focuses on strengthening and streamlining the pension system. It
provides significant improvements in the pension systems, including: (i) introduction of an
equal retirement age for men and women at age 63; (ii) separation of social insurance
benefits from social pensions; (iii) elimination of most early retirement provisions; (iv)
indexation of pension to inflation; and (v) establishment of more direct links between
benefits and contributions, with adequate provision for a minimum benefit. Following
adoption of the law, the government has made satisfactory progress in its implementation.
The government decree no. 309 of July 2003, established an inter agency working group to
monitor introduction of the Personal Identification Numbers (PINs) into the pension system.
Additionally, a range of necessary implementation regulations, based on the Public Pension
Law, was developed, including: (i) the documents required for award of pensions; (ii) rules
for awarding and making payments for partial pensions to those with less than the minimum

- 50 -

APPENDIX III

required length of insurance history; (iii) procedures for making payments of the survivors’
pensions to children under full state custody; and (iv) procedures for awarding, computing
and making payments of the privileged pensions. While the fiscal performance of the Sate
Pension Fund has improved and as a result, the average pension has increased, the level,
coverage and sustainability of pensions are issues for further elaboration.
II. Lending
World Bank lending to Armenia as of October 13, 2004 totals US$822.1 million, of which
US$672.6 million has been disbursed. Of the 36 IDA credits and 1 IBRD loan approved,
17 have closed.
Building on the major Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP)’s themes, the fourth
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Armenia was discussed in the World Bank Board of
Executive Directors on June 10, 2004 to focus on three main objectives of: (i) promoting
private sector led economic growth, (ii) making growth more pro-poor, and (iii) reducing
non-income poverty. Unless the high case is reached, IDA lending is expected to be up to
$45 million a year during the forthcoming CAS period and could reach up to $55 million a
year if Armenia moves into the high case during the FY05–08 CAS period. Towards the end
of the CAS period, there could be a first IBRD loan if Armenia’s creditworthiness improves
sufficiently. The CAS includes three Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSCs) for FY05,
06 and 07. These will support the PRSP objectives and focus on four critical reform themes:
(i) consolidating macroeconomic discipline and strengthening governance, (ii) sharpening
competition and entrenching property rights, (iii) mitigating social and environment risk, and
(iv) modernizing the rural economy. Macroeconomic stability is a precondition for the PRSC
and is vital for facilitating an enabling environment necessary for successful structural
reforms implementation. The PRSC’s preparation is being closely coordinated with the IMF
Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF). The first proposed PRSC is expected to be
presented to the World Bank Board of Executive Directors on November 18, 2004.

APPENDIX IV

ARMENIA: RELATIONS WITH THE EUROPEAN BANK FOR
RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT (EBRD)
(As of October 1, 2004)
As of October 1, 2004, EBRD had signed twelve projects in the power, transport,
agribusiness, mining and financial sectors. Total cumulative commitments amounted to
EUR 93.5 million.
There are two sovereign projects. First, the EBRD approved a sovereign guaranteed loan of
EUR 54.8 million for construction of the Hrazdan Unit 5 thermal power plant in March 1993,
partly aimed at the eventual closure of Armenia’s nuclear plant in Medzamor. The
government is contemplating the privatization of Hrazdan Unit 5 as the completion of this
plant is constrained by limited budgetary resources. The EBRD had funded technical
assistance for the Hrazdan privatization prospectus and continues to follow the privatization
process. The Hrazdan Thermal Power Complex excluding the unfinished Unit 5 has been
transferred to the Russian Federation in the context of the debt-for-equity deal. Second, in
November 1994, the agreement on a EUR 21.8 million loan to build an air cargo terminal in
Zvartnots airport was signed under a guarantee by the Armenian government. The airport
was transferred to private management in 2002. The new management has prepared a master
plan for the development of the airport, which is expected to generate further cargo traffic for
the cargo terminal.
There have also been a number of private sector projects in Armenia. The EBRD has
provided a loan to the Yerevan Brandy Company owned by Pernod Ricard of France
(EUR 19.1 million). In the banking sector, an equity participation in the Commercial Bank of
Greece-Armenia (EUR 1.1 million) was approved in late 1999. Moreover, a multi-bank
on-lending facility of EUR 10 million was activated in early 2000. Within the framework of
multi-bank facility the Bank currently has credit lines for micro and small enterprises with
three local banks (a total of EUR 4 million). The EBRD is committed to further expanding
lending under this facility to other banks. A Trade Facilitation Program with the purpose to
facilitate access of Armenian banks to trade financing was also made available to four
Armenian banks. In 2002 a loan to finance EUR 2.9 million in working capital expansion
was signed with the Armenian Copper Programme (the only copper smelter in the region)
and a new loan (EUR 4.3 million), including the refinancing of the existing loan, was signed
in August 2004. Moreover, the EBRD has launched the Turn Around Management (TAM)
and Business Advisory Service Programmes in Armenia in 2003, funded by the EU-Tacis
program, to support micro, small and medium-sized enterprises.
The key priorities of the EBRD for the coming years are (i) enterprise sector, (ii) financial
sector, (iii) portfolio monitoring and implementation support and (iv) infrastructure and
state-owned public utilities. The EBRD’s new country strategy was approved in
November 2003.

APPENDIX V

ARMENIA: STATISTICAL ISSUES
The overall quality, timeliness, and coverage of macroeconomic statistics in Armenia have
improved significantly over the past few years, a process in which the Fund has been heavily
involved through technical assistance from the Statistics Department, the Fiscal Affairs
Department, and the Monetary and Exchange Affairs Department. On November 7, 2003
Armenia subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) and has provided
timely data for all SDDS prescribed data categories. Further improvements are needed in
real, fiscal, and external sector statistics in order to enhance the design and monitoring of
economic policies. The table below on core statistical indicators shows the availability of key
macroeconomic data and the authorities’ publication policy.
National accounts and price statistics. The National Statistics Service has made significant
changes to the national accounts methodology to bring it in line with international best
practices. Progress has been made in developing estimates of quarterly real GDP that are now
published. Basic data collection procedures have also improved, with national accounts
adopting the concept of gross value based on accrued sales valued at transaction prices.
However, progress has been slow in improving the compilation of national accounts at
constant prices; these data are still derived by re-valuing current output and inputs at previous
year prices instead of deflating these by the relevant components of the producer price index.
Data on the consumer price index and wages are reported on a timely basis, but wage data are
still limited to the public sector.
Fiscal statistics. The budget execution reporting system is compiled on a cash-basis and
supplemented with monthly reports on arrears and quarterly reports on receivables and
payables. However, the system to track arrears is cumbersome and there is a 45-day lag in the
compilation of the data. Daily revenue and cash expenditure data for the central government
are available with a lag of one to two days. The Ministry of Finance is undertaking a
comprehensive reform of the treasury system, including the introduction of an internal
auditing system in line ministries and their budgetary institutions. A single treasury account
(TSA) was introduced in 1996, and all bank accounts held by budgetary institutions were
closed, except for Project Implementation Units that are required by donors to operate with
commercial banks’ accounts. Starting in 2002, some budgetary institutions have been
converted into “noncommercial organizations” (NCOs). These units have been taken out of
the treasury system and have their own bank accounts. They have just started reporting data
on their operations to the Ministry of Finance. With these exceptions, all government receipts
and payments are processed through the TSA, although there are still shortcomings on the
timeliness and quality of data on the operations of local governments. Classification of
government transactions by function and economic category are generally in line with the
Manual on Government Finance Statistics 1986, and monthly data on central government
operations are disseminated within 40 days of the end of the month. However, the budget
presentation and the classification of items under the economic and functional classification
of expenditures need to be made more transparent; for instance, the data has been subject to
frequent reclassifications and wages for military personnel are reported in the broader
category of “other” goods and services rather than as a wage item. The reconciliation of

- 54 -

APPENDIX V

central government with general government operations is also difficult owing to the need to
identify manually transactions among central government, local government, and the Social
Insurance State Fund. The authorities expect by early 2005 to begin providing date for
publication in the GFS Yearbook or in the IFS in early 2005.
Money and banking statistics. Money and banking statistics are provided on a timely basis.
Daily data on the accounts of the CBA are provided weekly with a one-day lag, while weekly
data on the monetary survey are provided with a one-week lag. Monthly interest rate data are
provided with an one-week lag. A new chart of accounts meeting International Accounting
Standards (IAS) was introduced in January 1998. Since then, the balance sheets of the CBA
and of the deposit money banks follow IAS methodology.
External sector statistics. The coverage of external sector data has improved in recent years.
Trade statistics are provided on a timely basis, and trade data by origin or destination and by
commodity are generally available within a month. Price data for exports and imports is
less readily available. Quarterly balance of payment data are generally available with a
three-month lag. However, data on private non-guaranteed external debt and on direct
investment abroad are not compiled, and capital outflows are likely underestimated. The
balance of payments data will need to be revised in light of recent studies showing that
remittance inflows have been underestimated. The absence of a fully established
(comprehensive and updated) business register in Armenia hampers a wider coverage of
transactions and institutional units. The international investment position for 1997–2003 has
been compiled and published.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
December 1, 2004
1.
The following information has become available since the issuance of the staff report
on November 17. It does not change the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
Recent data on monetary aggregates, inflation, and the exchange rate have been in
line with expectations. By end-October, the annual growth of reserve money and broad
money was 12 and 22 percent, respectively. The 12-month rate of inflation in November was
4.8 percent, down from 6.1 percent in September. The exchange rate has remained broadly
stable since September, trading in a range of 496 to 508 drams per U.S. dollar.
3.
After a series of delays, parliament approved on November 22 the law on trade and
services and the law on cash registers. This was a structural benchmark under the fifth review
of the program. These laws expand the tax base to large retail markets and are expected to
become effective in January.
4.
As noted in the staff report, the last intervened bank (Armcommunications bank) was
recapitalized by a new investor in October. The authorities have informed the staff that the
investor has acquired both the bank and the chemical company Nairit (the bank’s main
debtor) and is expected to either sell or swap shares of Nairit with interested parties or
depositors. However, the market value of Nairit is uncertain, raising questions about the
bank’s solvency. The staff has advised the authorities to ensure that the bank complies with
prudential norms.
5.
Last week, parliament approved the first reading of a bill amending the country’s
anti-money laundering and terrorist financing legislation. The amendments include
procedures for investigating suspicious transactions and creating a Financial Intelligence Unit
at the central bank. The bill had been initially rejected as some legislators expressed concerns
about the treatment of worker’s remittances.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
December 10, 2004

International Monetary Fund

Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes Article IV Consultation
with the Republic of Armenia
On December 1, 2004, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with the Republic of Armenia.1
Background
Armenia’s economy has performed well during the last three years. Annual real GDP growth
averaged 12 percent between 2001 and 2003. Fiscal and quasi-fiscal deficits were significantly
reduced and inflation remained in single digits. The external current account deficit fell rapidly
in response to strong export growth stemming from increased competitiveness as well as
import substitution. Poverty, while still high, fell about 8 percentage points to an estimated
43 percent of the population.
Armenia’s strong economic performance has been continuing in 2004. In the period January–
September, the year-on-year rate of GDP growth was 10 percent, fueled by increases in
agricultural production, housing construction, and services. GDP growth for the year as a whole
is projected to be 9 percent. The 12-month rate of inflation fell from 8.6 percent in December
2003 to 6.1 percent in September. The central bank’s inflation objective of 3 percent for 2004 is
within reach, but may be exceeded slightly because of recent increases in fuel prices.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

-2On fiscal policy, tax revenues through September 2004 increased by 21 percent over the same
period last year. The fiscal deficit in 2004 is projected at 1.1 percent of GDP because of underexecution of expenditures mainly due to capacity constraints. The 2005 budget is expected to
target a fiscal deficit of about 2 percent of GDP and will accommodate higher social and
infrastructure spending in line with Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper priorities, while
rationalizing nonpriority current expenditures. The projected deficit is consistent with
macroeconomic stability.
Regarding monetary policy, broad money and private sector credit grew by 20 percent and
43 percent in the year through September respectively. In 2004, reserve money and broad
money are projected to grow at about 4 percent and 15 percent, respectively.
Since mid-2003, banking sector performance has improved and there has been a gradual
return of confidence toward banks following the resolution of eight intervened banks. While
interest rates have continued their gradual declining trend, dollarization remains at over
70 percent.
After a slight deterioration in 2003, the external current account deficit is expected to narrow to
5.6 percent of GDP in 2004 because of higher workers’ remittances. Despite lower capital
grants, the capital and financial account remain well supported by continued increases in
foreign investment. Gross international reserves are expected to remain slightly below
four months of imports. External debt ratios are projected to decline further in 2004–05.
The recent real exchange rate appreciation has helped to mitigate the effect of recent hikes in
the prices of imported fuels on inflation and on real incomes. The appreciation only partially
compensates for a more than 25 percent real depreciation between 2000 and 2003.
The structural reform agenda has progressed during the last two years, although there have
been a number of delays. There was good progress in strengthening expenditure control,
reducing red tape, and improving efficiency in the energy and water sectors. Notwithstanding
these achievements, there is a need for further deepening of structural reforms to revamp tax
and customs administration, strengthen the financial system and the judiciary, improve
expenditure management, and increase efficiency in the water and irrigations sectors.
To tackle corruption in the public sector, the implementation of the recently prepared
anti-corruption strategy needs to be stepped up, especially regarding the development of an
independent judicial system.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the Armenian authorities for remarkable progress made,
particularly in recent years, to consolidate macroeconomic stability and build the foundations
for a modern market economy. Prudent economic policies and structural reforms have
contributed to double-digit growth, poverty reduction, low inflation, and a sustainable debt
burden. Notwithstanding these achievements, Directors noted that some structural reforms had
suffered from delays or incomplete implementation, and that important challenges remain to
sustain high rates of economic growth and reduce poverty further.

-3Directors endorsed the current stance of monetary policy aimed at lowering annual inflation to
3 percent. They agreed that the planned deepening of the government debt market would
facilitate monetary management and private debt issues. While welcoming the recent increase
in credit to the private sector, Directors underscored the importance of monitoring closely the
quality of loan portfolios and potential foreign exchange risks as part of the steps to strengthen
banking supervision. Directors also noted that further efforts are needed to increase financial
intermediation, including enhancing corporate governance in banks, streamlining collateral
recovery procedures, and improving court processes. They looked forward to the
recommendations of the forthcoming Financial Sector Assessment Program mission. Approval
by parliament of the anti-money laundering and financing of terrorism legislation, and its
implementation would also be important.
Directors considered that the flexible exchange rate regime has served Armenia well,
facilitating the conduct of monetary policy and helping the economy to adjust to external
shocks. They noted that the recent appreciation of the dram has helped offset the impact of
higher import prices on inflation, while competitiveness has been safeguarded by productivity
gains since 2001.
Directors welcomed the progress made in reducing fiscal imbalances in recent years. They
looked forward to a cautious fiscal stance in 2005 and an expenditure envelope in line with
PRSP priorities on social and infrastructure spending. Directors also welcomed the planned
increases in social spending in the 2005 budget, but emphasized the importance of capacity
building and transparency in state-owned noncommercial organizations to ensure the efficient
provision of social services. At the same time, a balanced mix of current and capital
expenditures will be critical to sustain the high trajectory of growth. This will require higher
allocations to capital expenditures in the transport, agriculture, and water sectors. In this
regard, Directors encouraged the authorities to formulate a medium-term public investment
program to define and prioritize public investment and poverty reduction needs as well as
guide future external assistance.
On the revenue side, Directors generally expressed disappointment that, despite high growth in
nominal tax revenues in recent years, the tax effort has not increased. In this regard, Directors
noted that remaining deficiencies and discretion in tax and customs administration are one of
the key barriers to higher tax collection, and urged the authorities to make wide use of
improved systems for collection, VAT refunds, and customs clearance. This would yield the
higher tax revenues that are needed to maintain fiscal sustainability and finance rising levels of
pro-poor spending. Directors also endorsed the staff’s proposals to revamp the organizational
structure of the tax and customs agencies and bring them under the umbrella of the Ministry of
Finance.
The authorities should be commended for the progress made in the energy sector in recent
years. Notwithstanding these achievements, Directors underscored the importance of
completing reforms in this sector and advancing the reform agenda in the water and irrigation
sectors, including through bringing tariffs toward cost-recovery levels.

-4Directors noted that governance and the business environment have improved in recent years,
but that more remains to be done to reduce red tape, increase accountability in the public
sector, and combat corruption. To this end, they urged the authorities to avoid complacency
and press ahead with the implementation of the anti-corruption strategy in consultation with
civil society. Regarding the PRSP, Directors welcomed the recent establishment of monitoring
indicators and looked forward to the forthcoming progress report on its implementation.
Directors welcomed the opportunity to review the ex post assessment of Armenia’s long-term
program engagement. They agreed that Fund involvement has been effective in promoting
sound economic policies and reforms. While recognizing that much has been achieved during
the last 10 years, Directors noted that a stronger political commitment would be needed to
address remaining problems in tax and customs administration, the banking system, and to
improve governance. In the context of such a demonstrated commitment, Directors considered
that a new arrangement with the Fund could play a valuable role in facilitating consensus on
appropriate policies and providing confidence to donors and investors.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today completed the sixth and

Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement. The completion of this review enables
Armenia to draw an amount equivalent to SDR 9.0 million (about US$13.7 million).
In completing the final review, the Executive Board also approved Armenia’s request for a
waiver of two structural performance criteria.
At the time of the fifth review on May 3, 2004 the period of the arrangement was extended
through December 31, 2004 (see Press Release No. 04/90). Armenia’s PRGF arrangement was
initially approved with effect from May 23, 2001 (see Press Release No. 01/25) for an amount
equivalent to SDR 69 million (about US$105.3 million). With the completion of the sixth
review, the arrangement will be fully disbursed. The authorities have also stated their intention to
begin discussions with the IMF on a new three-year PRGF arrangement that would support an
economic program through 2008.
Following the Executive Board’s discussion of Armenia’s performance under the current
PRGF-supported program, Agustín Carstens, Deputy Managing Director and Acting Chair, said:
“The Armenian authorities should be commended for Armenia’s strong economic performance
in recent years, in the context of satisfactory implementation of the PRGF-supported program.
Prudent monetary and fiscal policies, external financial support, and progress with structural
reforms have contributed to double-digit economic growth, poverty reduction, low inflation, and
a sustainable debt burden.
“Looking ahead, the authorities should maintain a cautious fiscal stance and ensure that the
expenditure envelope is in line with PRSP priorities on social and infrastructure spending.
Monetary policy should remain tight while maintaining a flexible exchange rate regime in order
to bring inflation down to the authorities’ objective of 3 percent. To facilitate further financial
intermediation, reforms are needed to enhance corporate governance in banks, streamline
collateral recovery procedures, and improve court processes.

“Notwithstanding the progress made in recent years, the authorities need to tackle more
forcefully the remaining deficiencies and reduce discretion in tax and customs administration.
This will contribute to an improved business environment and yield higher tax revenues to
finance pro-poor spending. On the expenditure side, a balanced mix between current and capital
spending will be critical to sustain the high trajectory of growth. This will require higher
allocations to capital expenditures in the transport, agriculture, and water sectors. At the same
time, the envisaged increases in social spending highlight the importance of ensuring that they
will be utilized efficiently and transparently.
“The authorities should be commended for the improvement in the energy sector in recent years.
Looking ahead, the authorities need to complete the reform agenda in this sector and step up the
implementation of reforms in the water and irrigation sectors, including through an increase in
tariffs to cost recovery levels.
“Armenia’s medium-term prospects are likely to remain favorable provided the authorities move
ahead with the implementation of the reform agenda and redouble their efforts to improve
governance,” Mr. Carstens stated.
The PRGF is the IMF’s concessional facility for low-income countries. PRGF-supported
programs are based on country-owned poverty reduction strategies adopted in a participatory
process involving civil society and development partners, and articulated in a Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper, or PRSP. This is intended to ensure that each PRGF-supported program is
consistent with a comprehensive framework for macroeconomic, structural, and social policies,
to foster growth and reduction poverty. PRGF loans carry an annual interest rate of 0.5 percent,
and are repayable over 10 years with a 5 ½-year grace period on principal payments.
