Staff Report for the 2008 Article IV Consultation, Fourth Review Under the ThreeYear Arrangement Under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility,
and Request for Augmentation of Access
Prepared by the African Department
(In consultation with other departments)
Approved by Robert J. Corker and Anthony Boote
May 30, 2008
• Economic growth is recovering, but price stability has been threatened by the surge in world food
and oil prices. The pace of structural reforms remains slow.
• Benin’s three-year Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement (10 percent of
quota) was approved on August 5, 2005; the third review took place on June 11, 2007 and the
arrangement was extended until August 4, 2009. The authorities are requesting an augmentation of
access to deal with rising food and oil prices. If approved, total access will rise to SDR 15.48 million
(25 percent of quota) of which SDR 3.52 million has been disbursed so far. An additional SDR
10.17 million, including SDR 9.29 million (15 percent of quota) in higher access, will become
available upon completion of this review.
• The last Article IV consultation was completed on November 27, 2006; discussions on the 2008
Article IV consultation and fourth PRGF review were conducted in Cotonou March 3–17, 2008. The
staff team met His Excellency President Boni Yayi; The Honorable P. Koupaki, Minister of
Development, Prospective and Public Policy Assessment; The Honorable S. Lawani, Minister of
Economy and Finance; Mr. M. de Souza, National Director for the Central Bank of West African
States (BCEAO); and other senior officials. The staff team comprised Messrs. Matungulu (head),
Youm, Samake, Dwight, Guerami (all AFR), and Yao (resident representative). Mr. G. K. Mpatswe,
Advisor to the Executive Director, attended some of the meetings. The mission worked with parallel
World Bank teams and met with representatives of the donor community, the private sector, and
Benin’s main civil service unions.
• Benin, a member of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU), has accepted the
obligations under Article VIII and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on payments
and transfers for current international transactions.
• The discussions reviewed progress on the PRGF-supported program and assessed economic
performance and prospects focusing on the challenges of preserving macroeconomic stability while
increasing pro-poor and pro-growth spending and improving competitiveness to accelerate growth
and facilitate progress toward the MDGs.

Executive Summary
•

In the last two years, Benin has experienced a pickup in growth and low inflation.
This has been supported by prudent fiscal policies—both strengthened revenue
performance and expenditure discipline—and external debt relief. However, structural
weaknesses in the economy have not been addressed. And the external environment
has become less favorable with a strengthening CFA franc adding to competitiveness
concerns and surging food and fuel prices accentuating a deterioration in the terms of
trade.

•

Medium-term economic prospects are favorable, but absent accelerated reforms in the
cotton and public utilities sectors growth is likely to remain below that required to
make more rapid progress to the MDGs.

•

The authorities plan to maintain a sound fiscal position and enhance fiscal space for
pro-poor spending through further revenue enhancement. Cognizant that progress in
meeting fiscal targets could be undermined by tax cuts and subsidies to defray the cost
of high food and fuel prices, they are considering more targeted and cost efficient
support to the most vulnerable. To meet increased balance of payments financing
needs from rising food and oil prices, the authorities have requested an augmentation
of access to Fund resources (by 15 percent of quota).

•

Effective use of fiscal space and borrowing space in the medium term will require
improvements in public expenditure management, particularly as regards capital
spending. Public borrowing on concessional terms is needed to maintain debt
sustainability.

•

While the real exchange rate appears broadly in line with fundamentals,
competitiveness should be strengthened. There is broad agreement that structural
reform is the remedy.

•

The authorities’ plans to reform the cotton and utilities sectors are moving slowly.
These are crucial sectors for the economy and need to become more dynamic.

•

Staff recommends completion of the fourth review and augmentation of the access
level under the arrangement to 25 percent of quota. However, while macroeconomic
targets have been all met, the slowness of structural reform implementation remains a
cause for concern and detracts from program performance.

5
I. BACKGROUND
1.
Benin’s macroeconomic performance continues to improve, but progress in
addressing core economic vulnerabilities has been slow. A much-publicized
acceleration of the structural reform agenda has not materialized, and competitiveness
has been undermined by a real appreciation of the effective exchange rate, deterioration
in the terms of trade, and some weakening in the business environment. More recently,
Benin has had to cope in addition with the surge in world food prices. In April’s local
elections, President Boni Yayi had mixed success in strengthening his mandate to
implement economic reforms.

II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND PROGRAM PERFORMANCE
2.
Economic performance has been broadly satisfactory since the last Article
IV report was issued in 2006, with growth continuing to recover from its 2001–05
slowdown (Figures 1 and 2). Preliminary data put real GDP growth at 4.6 percent in
2007, up from an annual average of 3.4 percent in 2005-06, underpinned by brisk
activity in the port, transport and commerce sectors on the strength of enhanced Cotonou
port competitiveness; and by a favorable food harvest. These factors countered the
adverse impact of a regional energy crisis and lower-than-programmed cotton output.
3.
World food price inflation is sparking an uptick in consumer prices
(Figure 4). As a result of good weather and comfortable local food availability in 2007,
average inflation decelerated to 1.3 percent (3.8 in 2006), below the West African
Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) threshold of 3 percent; this helped to
moderate appreciation of the real effective exchange rate (REER). However, a spike in
world food prices before the New Year’s celebrations prompted the authorities to
impose price controls (Box 1). These did not prevent food prices surging by 8 percent in
the first quarter of 2008.
4.
The external current account deficit widened because of terms of trade
deterioration and real currency appreciation. However, thanks to large inflows,
mostly of official capital grants, the balance of payments recorded a sizable surplus,
keeping official reserves at about 15 months of imports.
5.
Fiscal performance exceeded expectations in several respects although
public investment lagged. At 3 percent of GDP, the surplus on the narrowly defined
primary fiscal balance was 2 percentage points above target. Key fiscal developments
were:

Box 1. Benin: Coping with Rising Food Prices
On December 8, 2007, the Government of Benin introduced fiscal measures to
address rising food prices (see paragraph 19 below). The measures were initially
intended to last through mid-March 2008; they have since been extended to July and are
likely to remain in place through year-end. They consist of
•
•

Elimination of customs tariffs for pasta, tomato paste, and sweetened condensed
milk; and
Reduction of customs fees—using below-market reference prices for taxation
purposes—for refined sugar, rice, wheat and wheat powder, corn and maize, and
soybeans.

Under the arrangement, retail prices are derived by downwardly adjusting costbased prices to reflect granted tax relief.

9

•

•

Better revenue mobilization, with tax
revenue nearly reaching the WAEMU
target of 17 percent of GDP for the first
time and the authorities collecting
2.3 percent of GDP in one-off nontax
receipts from cellular phone licenses.

Better control of spending on goods and
services, including the wage bill;
overruns on payments to state-owned
energy companies to contain increases
in electricity tariffs and petroleum
product prices; and underspending on
domestically funded capital projects
(68 percent) due to limited absorptive
capacity.
A hefty net increase in government
deposits with the banking system
(5.1 percent of GDP), reflecting limited
use of investment funds raised in the
WAEMU financial market 1 and
difficulties in translating fiscal space
into more ambitious pro-growth
spending.
Tightened governance in the revenue
agencies and determined
implementation of IMF Fiscal Affairs
Department technical assistance (TA)
recommendations on revenue
management, mainly directed to tax and
customs administration—especially at
the large-taxpayer unit.

improved budgetary situation and related increases in Treasury deposits in the banking
system, net bank credit to the government again contracted, permitting a 26 percent
expansion of credit to the private sector, mostly for commerce, transportation, and
telecommunications activities. The credit expansion prompted the authorities to keep the
reserve ratio at 15 percent (the highest in the WAEMU) to insure against inflationary and
capital flight repercussions.
7.
Performance on the program was generally satisfactory (MEFP, Tables 1 and 2).
All quantitative benchmarks for end-September and performance criteria for end-December
2007 were observed by large margins. However, only two of four structural benchmarks for
the second half of 2007 were implemented, one with a delay. The single taxpayer
identification number system was introduced and a study of the efficiency of customs
completed before year-end, but audit of PFM information systems and a draft strategy for
reforming the civil service pension fund were not completed by year-end. The authorities are
taking steps to complete these measures before end-2008.
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
8.
The Benin authorities have maintained macroeconomic stability but face major
policy challenges in raising growth to address poverty. While revenue performance has
improved markedly in these post-HIPC/MDRI years, capacity problems have limited the
translation of higher fiscal space into more development spending; and a much-publicized
acceleration of the structural reform agenda has not materialized. At the same time, a steady
nominal effective appreciation of the euro-pegged CFA franc, deterioration in key areas of
the business environment, and reemergence of heavy wage demands are raising
competitiveness concerns.
9.

With this in mind, discussions concentrated on three topics:


Medium-term macroeconomic prospects and objectives;



Fiscal policy and PFM reforms to support growth and poverty reduction while
preserving external stability; and



Structural reforms, including second-generation initiatives, to nurture competitiveness
and foster private sector development.

Staff also assessed conditions for completing the fourth PRGF review.
A. Medium-Term Macroeconomic Objectives
10.
Benin’s medium-term economic prospects seem generally favorable, although
growth is likely to continue to fall short of what is required to rapidly reduce poverty.

11
The authorities concurred that growth will remain heavily dependent on performance in the
port and cotton sectors, with a pickup in construction and public works supporting domestic
demand as the government rebuilds the economic and social infrastructure. Cotton production
and export growth are projected to remain below potential in view of slow progress in sector
reform (see below); and imports of oil and capital goods would grow only moderately in real
terms due to capacity limitations. Consistent with likely developments in world oil and staple
food prices, the terms of trade are projected to deteriorate moderately. Absent a marked
acceleration of structural reforms, the main elements of the medium-term macroeconomic
framework are:
•

Annual average real GDP growth of 5½ percent through 2011; with average inflation at
the top of the WAEMU ceiling of 3 percent.

•

A generally sound external position—a projected current account deficit of 6–7 percent of
GDP seems sustainable given expected financing—and manageable debt service
obligations (Box 3).

•

A stability-oriented, narrowly defined annual primary fiscal surplus of 1 percent of GDP,
which will accommodate a gradual increase in pro-growth spending.

12
Box 2. 2006 Article IV Recommendations
Advice
Improve revenue administration and
expenditure management to achieve fiscal
consolidation and increase pro-poor
spending.

Status
The authorities have improved revenue collection
and the fiscal position. However, limited absorptive
capacity and poor expenditure management frustrates
their ambition to increase spending on infrastructure
and pro-poor projects.

•

Continue efforts to reduce nonperforming
loans and avoid loan concentration risks in
financial institutions.

Nonperforming loans rose to around 10 percent of
banks’ portfolios. Deterioration of the portfolio of
microfinance institutions was more severe. Benin is
bound by the decision taken by WAEMU institutions
to raise, starting January 1, 2008, minimum capital
requirement to CFAF 1 billion for nonbank financial
institutions and CFAF 5 billion for banks.

•

Give due consideration to external debt
sustainability in new borrowing.

External borrowing has been limited to concessional
credits. Domestic borrowing has increased
dramatically; however, including funds raised
nonconcessionally on the WAEMU financial market.

•

Enhance competitiveness through reforms in
the parastatal sector.

Parastatal reform was set back by the unsuccessful
privatization of the ginning company, SONAPRA.
Preparation for government disengagement from
other public enterprises is taking longer than
anticipated.

•

Pursue reforms to address weaknesses in the
judicial system, modernize land tenure, and
facilitate access to financial services for
small and medium-sized enterprises.

Preparation for second-generation reforms in these
areas is proceeding, financed for the most part by
MCA-Benin.

•

13
Box 3. Benin : Debt Status and Prospects
Debt relief from the HIPC Initiative in 2003 and MDRI in 2006 has greatly reduced
Benin’s debt. The external public debt-to-GDP ratio fell to 12 percent in 2006 from about
59 percent in 2001. Domestic public debt is about 3.6 percent of GDP.
Benin’s risk of debt distress is moderate. All indicators in the 2007 DSA baseline scenario
are far below policy-dependent thresholds. However, the NPV of debt-to-export threshold is
breached in scenarios that incorporate lower growth, more volatile cotton production, and less
generous financing terms. Fiscal sustainability analysis confirms these results and highlights
concerns about the cost of heavy domestic borrowing at high interest rates and shorter
maturities. The authorities could reduce risks and safeguard debt sustainability through
determined efforts to continue structural reforms (including measures to spur private sector
participation in development); address absorption constraints; and manage debt prudently
(Country Report No. 08/19).

11.
Within the medium-term framework the authorities see growth rising to
5.3 percent in 2008 despite the heightened risks of a difficult global environment.
Among factors underpinning the modest growth acceleration are
•

•

Robust port-related service
activities, based on expanded
merchandise handling capacity
as new cranes go into service;
modern management practices
facilitated by the recent
recruitment of an external port
expert and independent auditor;
and streamlined operations as
the port’s one-stop window is
activated.

activity in construction and public works—although this is being frustrated by supply
bottlenecks, such as the limited availability of cement and other construction materials
and a scarcity of skilled workers.
Continuing upward pressures on oil and food prices are expected to ratchet inflation up to the
upper bound of the WAEMU target (possibly beyond in case of sustained world oil and food
price increases). The supply of domestic foodstuffs is generally adequate.

The authorities expressed concern that developments in the global economy were
adding risks to Benin’s outlook, at least in the short term. They especially feared a
possible further deterioration in the terms of trade and the impact on real domestic incomes,
prices, and competitiveness—a concern amplified by continued strengthening of the CAF
franc. Other risks identified were unsettled energy prospects, weather-related shocks to
agriculture (including cotton production), uncertainties about relations with main trading
partners, and limited absorptive and institutional capacity. They reiterated their commitment
to growth-supporting reforms to insure against the risks. On the positive side, it was agreed
that demand from Nigeria’s oil-based economy, which is expected to sustain activity in the
port and transportation sectors as well as in agriculture and industry, would counterbalance
some of the risks.
B. Medium-Term Fiscal Strategy
13.
The mission discussed the outline of a pro-growth fiscal policy for the postMDRI era. Envisaged policy actions aim at further expanding government domestic
resources by raising the revenue ratio to 19.4 percent of GDP by 2011, and implementing
more ambitious pro-growth and pro-poor spending programs without jeopardizing recent

15
gains in economic stabilization. 2 In pursuit of the latter objective, the authorities will
continue to meet the WAEMU convergence criterion on the narrowly defined primary fiscal
balance—containing the overall fiscal balance (excluding grants) to around 4 ½ percent of
GDP and keeping demand-induced inflationary pressures in check. This would help limit
total debt (domestic and external) to below 20 percent of GDP by 2011; 80 percent of
identified government financing needs (averaging an estimated 2 percent of GDP) would be
filled with grants and the rest with concessional loans, consistent with recommendations from
the 2007 DSA.

Revenue-enhancing measures will be directed to making tax and customs
administration more efficient and rationalizing the tax system. Authorities noted that
their implementation of FAD recommendations in revenue administration had yielded good
results. The next areas of attention in revenue administration would be to
•

Effectively implement the new single taxpayer identification number system—which
would enhance taxpayer data exchanges between the General Tax and Customs
Directorates;

•

Further reinforce customs IT capacity in regional offices; and

•

Operate a one-stop window at the Port of Cotonou, which includes putting in place a
consolidated electronic billing system for port services, with financial and technical
support from the US-funded MCA-Benin.

15.
The authorities intend, with FAD technical assistance, to review Benin’s
domestic tax structure. 3 In particular, they are seeking to address competitiveness
2

Because of rapid fiscal consolidation, in 2007 Benin became the only WAEMU member country
meeting the convergence criterion on the (non-negative) narrowly defined fiscal balance.

3

An FAD tax policy mission is expected to be fielded in the second half of June 2008.

16
difficulties arising from disparities in WAEMU domestic tax rates—e.g., Benin’s corporate
income tax rate is 35 percent, Senegal’s is 25 percent—and substantially enhance domestic
tax performance as economic partnership agreements (EPA) are negotiated with Europe at the
regional level 4 and preparations continue on expanding regional integration beyond the
WAEMU. The envisaged overhaul of the tax system will be consistent with Benin’s fiscal
harmonization obligations under the WAEMU.
16.
The authorities concurred with staff that spending must continue to be prudent
until PFM and project evaluation are improved. Total spending is projected to rise to
23.2 percent of GDP by 2011, from 22 percent in 2007, consistent with the medium-term
revenue and fiscal balance objectives under the PRGF-supported program. However, while
committed to keeping Benin’s debt sustainable, the authorities considered a less conservative
spending target to accelerate their infrastructure rehabilitation program while external budget
support continues and borrowing is readily available in the regional financial market. They
agreed, however, that until Benin’s limited absorptive capacity is addressed, a cautious
approach to spending growth is preferable in the short term, with reduced net credit to the
government helping to improve borrowing prospects for the private sector.
17.
Better management of public investment is key to successfully implementing
more ambitious pro-growth expenditure programs. The rate of execution of domestically
funded investment outlays (DFIOs) inched up to 68 percent in 2007 (from 57 percent in
2006) as project preparation and procurement activities were exceptionally accelerated late in
the year under President Yayi’s direct supervision. The authorities attributed lackluster
performance in this area to scarcity of working materials and domestic expertise, poor
coordination of entities managing public investment, and to weak financial management
systems. They are therefore beefing up operating resources at the disposal of spending
ministries and units and intend bi-monthly cabinet consideration of reports on the execution
of DFIOs, which would be posted on the Web site of the Office of the President of the
Republic (MEFP, paragraph 28). Staff noted that public-private sector partnerships in
infrastructure rehabilitation and building are virtually nonexistent in Benin. They encouraged
the authorities to request World Bank TA on this and on drafting a comprehensive strategy to
expand absorptive capacity.
18.
The fiscal program for 2008 targets a moderate increase in spending to support
growth and poverty reduction. Without the exceptional nontax payments received from
cellular phone companies in 2007, and taking account of the impact of the price-moderating
4

A comprehensive assessment of the revenue impact has yet to be made at the national level, but the
authorities concurred that an appropriate policy response would include the introduction of
compensating revenue measures and tax reforms to broaden the tax base.

17
fiscal measures, revenue collection is projected to decline to 18.4 percent of GDP
(20.6 percent in 2007). With total expenditure (excluding interest payments and foreignfinanced investment) rising to 17.9 percent of GDP, the primary fiscal surplus would decline
to ½ percent of GDP (from 3 percent in 2007); and the overall fiscal deficit (cash basis,
excluding grants) would be contained at 4.4 percent of GDP. Beyond contributions from the
European Union, the World Bank and the African Development Bank, the authorities have
requested additional resources from the Fund (0.2 percent of GDP) to cover identified
financing needs (Tables 1, 2 and 4, and paragraph 29). They are also discussing additional
financing with other multilateral and bilateral donors.
19.
Rising food and oil prices pose some risk to fiscal targets and are causing a
deterioration of the external position. The limited tax cuts and subsidies entail a revenue
loss estimated at 1 percent of GDP and include CFAF 11 billion (0.4 percent of GDP) in
transfers to public utilities to contain anticipated energy cost increases. If the measures are
expanded or are not adequately implemented, the revenue loss could be much higher than
currently anticipated, which would cause the program’s fiscal target to be missed. In the
external sector, the current account deficit (excluding grants) is projected to widen
to 7.5 percent of GDP, from 6.9 percent in 2007(MEFP, paragraph 28). The authorities have
stressed that beyond the initial safeguard measures, sustained price increases would require
introduction of well-targeted social safety nets, with donor support if needed; they concurred
that to avoid jeopardizing domestic supply of affected products, enhanced price flexibility
would be needed in the medium to long term (MEFP, paragraph 13).
20.
In 2008 revenue mobilization efforts will be geared at reinforcing tax and
customs administration, and nonpriority expenditures will be rigorously monitored to
ensure that fiscal targets are met. Targeted increases in tax receipts will be driven by
governance improvements in the revenue agencies and by more effective tracking of
taxpayers as the new identification number becomes operational. Efforts will be stepped up to
control smuggling and better track exemptions. Domestically financed investment, focused
on priority sectors and taking into account absorptive capacity constraints, is projected at
CFAF 100.4 billion (3.5 percent of GDP, compared with 3.2 percent in 2007).
21.
The authorities remain concerned about pressures on public sector wages. Under
pressure from civil service trade unions, the government agreed a 25 percent increase in
teacher base salaries, effective July 2008. As a result, the wage bill is projected to rise to
5.7 percent of GDP (from 5.4 percent in 2007). While personnel outlays would remain within
the WAEMU target of 35 percent of tax revenue in 2008, and are projected to decline to an
annual average of 5.6 percent of GDP during 2009-2011, the authorities reaffirmed their
preference to keep for now a wage ceiling as program conditionality to manage wage
demands from public sector unions. Staff stressed that improvements in payroll systems
would be more effective, and encouraged the authorities to eliminate the ceiling as progress is

18
made on wage management. It further noted in this context that finalizing the strategy for
reforming the civil service pension fund and ensuring an early implementation of related
recommendations will contribute to preserving medium-term budget viability; and urged the
authorities to undertake this reform without delay.
C. Improving Competitiveness and Promoting the Private Sector
22.
Staff argued that, as a small coastal economy with a fixed exchange rate, Benin
must be especially ambitious in implementing structural reforms to preserve
competitiveness. In this regard, staff analysis points to a poor competitiveness profile for the
country5 :
•

As of 2007 Benin’s REER had appreciated 37 percent since the 1994 devaluation of the
CFA franc, more than any other WAEMU member. During the same period, relative
productivity gains have been modest—per capita output rose 20 percent, not exceptional
relative to the WAEMU countries and other trading partners.

•

Survey measures relevant to competitiveness rank Benin in the bottom 20 percent
worldwide (although it is one of the most competitive countries in the WAEMU). It
ranked 151 out of 178 in the World Bank’s 2008 Doing Business Indicators and 108 out
of 131 in the World Economic Forum’s 2008 Global Competitiveness Index. Areas in
need of urgent reform are contract enforcement, paying taxes, inadequacies in education,
and infrastructure.

However, a variety of macroeconomic analyses of the balance of payments and
the REER suggest that Benin’s current account balance and exchange rate are on
balance broadly in line with fundamentals:
•

The current account deficit is comfortably financed by inflows through the capital and
financial accounts, in particular project grants and loans, private capital, and inflows to
commercial banks, making Benin a net contributor to BCEAO reserves.

20
•

Econometric estimates of the fundamental effective exchange rate (FEER) 6 suggest the
REER is in line with fundamentals.

•

The macroeconomic balance approach suggests Benin’s current account deficit is in line
with the norm for a low income African country with substantial aid inflows.

•

However, longer-run external considerations, based on sustainable levels of foreign
direct investment as well as portfolio and debt flows, suggest that the current account
deficit might need to decline to 3-5 percent of GDP, from its underlying level of
6 percent of GDP, which would require a real depreciation of 5-12 percent 7 .

In conclusion, the current account and real exchange rate appear reasonably sustainable.
However, other indicators suggest that Benin needs to do more to boost competitiveness. As
the nominal exchange rate is fixed, this will require greater efforts to address structural and
institutional shortcomings.
6

The underlying current account balance was obtained by adjusting the observed current account for
temporary factors through two approaches, including applying filters to the data using a five-year
moving average and the Hodrick-Prescott filter (see footnote 5 above).
7

Estimated REER elasticities of the current account were used to determine the extent of REER
depreciation required to adjust the actual current account balance toward an NFA-stabilizing level (see
footnote 5 above).

21
The structural reform agenda
24.
Cognizant of Benin’s tenuous competitiveness, the authorities renewed their
commitment to structural reforms to improve the business environment and
reinvigorate growth. Staff urged them to address continuing delays especially in the cotton,
port, and public utilities sectors.
•

Cotton. After last year’s failed attempt to privatize state-owned ginning factories, the
government has undertaken a review of economic and institutional constraints in the
cotton sector with a view to drafting a new sector strategy. Beyond issues relating to
state disengagement from commercial activities, the strategy is to (i) revisit the
government’s role in determining producer prices and in the handling of contracts for
the import and distribution of fertilizers and other inputs, and (ii) redefine accordingly
the institutional framework governing relations between cotton-sector stakeholders.
To enhance ownership, the strategy is being prepared in consultation with all key
stakeholders; it is expected to be completed by year-end (a structural benchmark). The
mission noted the lack of World Bank technical assistance in drafting the new
framework and urged the authorities to secure it soon.

•

Port of Cotonou. The authorities reported the recent appointment of an independent
auditor for port operations and progress in putting in place a near-concessioning
arrangement involving a foreign partner of international repute in port management.
The MCA assured staff that a resident port management expert would be posted
shortly (end-June 2008 structural benchmark).

•

Public utilities reforms are suffering significant delays. Benin Telecoms is now slated
to be brought to the point of sale in the second half of 2009; the initial deadline was
January 2009. Also, the authorities plan to develop a strategy for state disengagement
from the electricity parastatal (SBEE) only after the company’s restructuring is
completed in December 2009. Consequently, bids for privatization cannot be issued
until well after the January 2009 deadline. Staff underscored the competitiveness
gains from public utilities reforms in terms of improved service quality and reliability,
but also regarding their potential for attracting investments in other major economic
sectors. It urged the authorities to ensure that these are accelerated with World Bank
support.

25.
Other measures planned to enhance competitiveness are initiation of a roadrehabilitation program, preparation of a strategy to diversify the economy, and reform
of the land tenure and judicial systems. A new World Bank-supported economic
diversification program is seeking to boost activity in export agriculture (based on traditional
crops—bananas, palm oil, and pineapple); transportation and telecommunications; and
tourism. The program also aims to raise local production and reduce imports of staple

22
foodstuffs, such as manioc and livestock. Steady progress in preparing feasibility studies and
sector strategies to address inefficiencies in the land tenure and judicial systems and to
improve credit access for small- and medium-sized companies is being made.
26.
The authorities are moving to improve commercial bank compliance with
prudential indicators. Benin’s banking system features high concentration of credit, little
portfolio diversification, and considerable maturity mismatch between demand for and supply
of long-term financial resources. Moreover, four institutions bore 80 percent of nonperforming loans accounting for 9 percent of total bank loans in 2007. BCEAO, the regional
central bank, is phasing in an increase of commercial bank minimum capital from CFAF 1
billion to CFAF 10 billion. The staff noted that compliance with prudential requirements had
deteriorated somewhat and urged the authorities to monitor the situation closely.

Benin’s local BCEAO management expressed firm support for enhanced
financial sector surveillance at the regional level, as advised by a recent WAEMU FSAP
mission. Finance ministry and national BCEAO officials are endeavoring to secure early
implementation of recent regional agreements on transferring from finance ministries to the
WAEMU Banking Commission the power to liquidate or place credit institutions under
temporary administration—which should make banking supervision more effective; and
making BCEAO the regulator for large microfinance institutions (MFIs). Parliament could
ratify these initiatives by year-end.

IV. FOURTH PRGF REVIEW, CAPACITY TO REPAY THE IMF, AND PROGRAM
MONITORING
28.
Conditions for completing the fourth PRGF review have generally been met. In
the last two years the authorities have achieved measurable improvements in the public

23
finances and presided over a rebound in growth despite a difficult international context and
vocal social demands—though economic activity has been less than the program expected.
Fiscal performance through March 2008 has been broadly satisfactory, and budgetary
prospects for the remainder of 2008 are consistent with understandings the mission reached
with the authorities on quantitative performance criteria for end-June and end-December
2008, in line with the 2008 budget (MEFP, Tables 1 and 2; Staff Report, Tables 2, 3, and 4). 8
On the structural front, the authorities are taking steps to ensure finalization by year-end of
two benchmarks that were not observed (completion of an audit of public expenditure
management IT systems and of a reform strategy for the civil service pension fund), along
with preparation of a strategy to improve PEM—a missed end-March 2008 structural
benchmark. The authorities attributed delays to difficulties in mobilizing needed donor
support, and stressed that a recent EU decision to provide technical and financial assistance
would facilitate progress going forward (MEFP, paragraph 27).
29.
Benin’s capacity to repay the Fund is sound and staff supports the authorities’
request for an augmentation of access under the PRGF. The proposed augmentation of
access of SDR 9.29 million (15 percent of quota) would increase the total access under the
program to 25 percent of quota. It takes into account the country’s current indebtedness to the
Fund and its excellent debt servicing record (Table 7). During the remainder of the program
period (2008-09), the annual average debt service to the Fund would be SDR 0.33 million, or
0.06 percent of export of goods and services and 0.04 percent of government revenue. The
request is justified on the basis of a weakening external current account, with the import bill
projected to increase by CFAF 65.2 billion in 2008 (2.3 percent of 2008 GDP) notably as a
result of the shock from rising oil and energy prices. The augmented resources would be
made available in one tranche (see Table 1) upon completion of this review.
30.
The program will be monitored quarterly, consistent with agreed quantitative
and structural performance criteria and benchmarks for specified test dates (MEFP,
Tables 1 and 2). On this basis, the fifth PRGF review is to be completed no later than
December 2008.
V. PRSP, OUTREACH, AND OTHER ISSUES
31.
The authorities have articulated ambitious growth objectives in the updated
(2007-09) Growth Strategy for Poverty Reduction Paper (GSPRP), which they issued in
June 2007. The GSPRP targets an annual real GDP growth of 7–8 percent in the medium
term. Like the PRGF-supported program, the GSPRP highlights efforts to enhance economic
stability, promote private sector development, and accelerate economic and export
8

The 2008 budget is consistent with the current PRGF arrangement; staff reviewed its outline with the
authorities during the third review discussions.

24
diversification. It assumes improved absorptive capacity and is premised on more external
financial assistance to facilitate achievement of the MDGs, and aims to foster regional
integration. The authorities concurred that, in addition to increased aid, more rigorous
structural and sectoral reforms would be needed to reach the ambitious GSPR growth targets.
They also agreed that the GSPR’s growth objectives are unlikely to be attained without a
substantial improvement in PFM for a better use of fiscal space and acceleration of reforms to
improve competitiveness.
32.
The first full Annual Progress Report (APR) on implementation of the GSPRP
is due out in the second half of 2008. In January 2008 the authorities completed an APR on
implementation of the poverty reduction strategy in 2006 and the first quarter of 2007 (the
APR and related JSAN are attached). They are finalizing a new APR that assesses progress in
implementing the GSPR over the 12-month period through June 2008.
33.
Progress toward the MDGs has been slow, and poverty is disappointingly high.
In 2006 37 percent of the population (39 percent in rural areas) lived below the national
poverty line of CFAF 82,224, up from 28 percent in 2002. On the other hand, access to basic
health and education services has improved.
34.
Benin is one of 10 countries for which increased international support is being
planned as part of a United Nations push to facilitate progress toward the MDGs.
Working with UNDP counterparts, staff discussed modalities for implementing the initiative
in Benin, including a medium-term budgetary framework that assumes a doubling of budget
support to the equivalent of US$85 per person by 2010, and a consequent scaling-up of progrowth and pro-poor spending. Under the initiative, increased resources would be used to
tackle capacity constraints that could hamper effective management of scaled-up budget
support. Staff is gauging the macroeconomic implications of anticipated higher external
assistance; the assessment is to be completed later in 2008.
35.
The quality and availability of statistical data for program monitoring are
adequate and improving. The coverage of fiscal data is currently limited to the central
government; FAD TA through Afritac-West is helping improve standardized reporting of
government financial operations.
36.
The mission met with representatives of trade unions, NGOs, and donors to
discuss Fund involvement in efforts to boost economic growth and reduce poverty in
Benin. Members of civil society and the trade unions underscored the need for enhanced
dialogue with government on policy issues; they considered the participatory PRSP process
to be a step in the right direction. Donors were concerned about the slow progress in
implementing structural reforms.

25
VI. STAFF APPRAISAL
37.
After several years of declining growth, Benin is experiencing a modest economic
revival. The challenge will be to build on the progress and raise growth to a rate more
consistent with rapid poverty reduction. This will require a more flexible and competitive
economy and infrastructure investment. In the short term, Benin will need to weather the
strains, including on the balance of payments, of rapid world food and fuel price inflation.
38.
Preserving macroeconomic stability is a primary medium-term government
objective. The authorities are appropriately consolidating recent gains in revenue
mobilization while keeping spending at levels compatible with fiscal viability. They are
making determined efforts to make the revenue agencies more efficient, and are scrutinizing
spending—especially personnel outlays—to ensure that pro-growth and pro-poor outlays are
protected.
39.
The authorities have understandably reacted to the food and fuel price shocks
which are having a significant impact on vulnerable groups. However, the tax cuts and
subsidy measures are likely to be an inefficient and costly way to limit the impact on the poor
and should be replaced by more targeted support measures. Staff supports the authorities’
plans to move in that direction.
40.
The authorities also intend to consolidate recent gains in debt sustainability and
to begin addressing Benin’s severe absorptive capacity constraints. The MDRI has
significantly lowered the debt burden and made space for substantial increases in pro-growth
and pro-poor spending, including through additional borrowing. New financing should be
obtained on terms that do not jeopardize debt sustainability and planned infrastructure
projects routinely be subjected to cost-benefit analysis. Staff encourages the authorities to
seek donor support to fill domestic capacity gaps in project design, implementation, and
monitoring. It urges timely completion of both the audit of PEM information systems and the
reform strategy for improving PEM; and calls for expeditious implementation of
recommendations from the latter.
41.
Slow progress in reforming the parastatals and cotton sectors is disappointing.
Accelerated restructuring of the telecommunications and electricity companies would enable
them, along with the port of Cotonou, to enhance competitiveness. In the cotton sector the
government’s recent decision not to interfere with the awarding of contracts for importation
and distribution of fertilizers and other inputs is commendable. It needs to be complemented
by long-awaited substantive reforms, especially state disengagement from ginning activities,
once the new sector reform strategy is completed in December.
42.
Reforms to strengthen the judicial and land tenure systems and facilitate access
to credit for more small- and medium-sized enterprises are needed. They would support

26
private sector development and allow for diversification of the production and export base,
making the economy more resilient to external shocks. There has been continuing progress in
preparing feasibility studies and strategies; what is now needed is expeditious
implementation of these second-generation and other structural reforms in the cotton and
public utilities sectors. The more so because while the real exchange rate appears to be
broadly in line with fundamentals, broadly defined competitiveness is far from adequate.

Staff recommends completion of the fourth review of the PRGF arrangement.
Program performance is broadly on track, and government is working to strengthen revenue
mobilization and consolidate spending discipline. However, if the structural reform agenda
continues to lag, the lack of progress will compromise the country’s growth and poverty
reduction prospects. Although implementation remains disappointing to date, the
administration has reiterated its readiness to rekindle all areas of the structural reform
program. In light of the above considerations, the staff recommends Board approval of the
authorities’ request for completion of the review and augmentation of the access under the
PRGF arrangement. The authorities are encouraged to expedite discussions with donors to
secure additional financing to ease the adjustment to high oil and food prices.
44.
Failure of the authorities to rally domestic support for structural reforms is a
key risk to the program along with external factors. High world oil and food prices and
the related deterioration in the terms of trade and persistent real currency appreciation are
immediate challenges. The authorities concur that greater resilience to shocks can only be
built through deepening and expediting the reform agenda.
45.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Benin take place within
24 months, subject to the decision on consultation cycles in program countries.

APPENDIX I—LETTER OF INTENT
REPUBLIC OF BENIN
MINISTRY OF ECONOMY AND FINANCE

Cotonou, May 30, 2008

THE MINISTER
To:
Dominique Strauss-Kahn
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, DC 20431

Dear Sir:
1.
A Fund staff mission visited Cotonou, Benin, during March 3-17, 2008 to conduct
discussions under the fourth review of the reform program supported by the arrangement
under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF). The mission also engaged in
consultations under Article IV of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement for 2008. Upon
completion of the mission’s discussions with the government, it was determined that all the
quantitative performance criteria and benchmarks set for end-September and end-December
2007 had been observed. With respect to structural reforms, two of the four structural
benchmarks under the program—namely, the audit of IT systems for public expenditure
management and preparation of the reform strategy for national pension fund—were not met.
However, the government has taken appropriate steps to ensure the successful completion of
these measures before year end.
2.
The mission noted that the rebound in growth observed since 2006 gathered
momentum in 2007, with real GDP growth reaching 4.6 percent, as against 3.8 percent in
2006. This was driven by the service sector, in particular transport and communications, and
commerce, reflecting a substantial upturn in activity at the Port of Cotonou. Growth has also
been enhanced by relatively favorable performance in agriculture—including cotton
production—although activity in the cotton sector has been weaker than anticipated. The
government intends to build upon and consolidate the results achieved to date. Accordingly,
it is committed to pursuing implementation of its structural reform program to improve
economic competitiveness and put the economy on a path of strong and sustainable growth
with the aim of addressing the challenges of poverty reduction more effectively.

37
3.
On December 8, 2007, the Government introduced fiscal measures to address rising
food and oil prices. The tax cuts and subsidies entail some revenue loss and include limited
transfers to public utilities to contain anticipated energy cost increases. Beyond contributions
from other donors, the government is requesting additional resources from the Fund
(0.2 percent of GDP) to cover the resulting balance of payments financing needs.
4.
The government wishes to continue benefiting from IMF technical and financial
assistance under the PRGF-supported program, and is therefore requesting the conclusion of
the fourth review and disbursement of related financial assistance from the Fund. It consents
to the publication of both the staff report and the memorandum on economic and financial
policies pertaining to the discussions under the fourth review of the program.

Very truly yours,

/s/
Soulé Mana Lawani

APPENDIX I. ATTACHMENT I—Memorandum on Economic and Financial Policies for
2007/08
I. INTRODUCTION
1.
The economic recovery that started in 2006 continued and was consolidated
in 2007. However, real GDP growth remained below initial projections and under the
minimum required for achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Based on the
available data, economic growth in 2007 is estimated at 4.6 percent, compared
with 3.8 percent in 2006. This resulted from picked up activity in the trade, transportation,
and agriculture sectors. The energy crisis dampened the economic expansion, especially in
the secondary sector.
2.
In 2007, domestic price increases decelerated further, contributing to the
stabilization of the real effective exchange rate. Despite strong pressure in the latter
months of the year, moderate food price increases during most of the period—as a result of a
good agricultural season, but also reflecting in part the impact (probably limited) of price
control measures introduced in November—helped lower average inflation to 1.3 percent,
compared with 3.8 percent in 2006. Thus, the inflation differential between Benin and its
trading partners improved further, helping to stabilize the real effective exchange rate despite
the nominal appreciation of the CFA franc against the dollar.
3.
The overall external position strengthened, driven by improvements in the
financial accounts of the balance of payments. The deterioration in the external current
account was more pronounced than expected, with the deficit (excluding official grants)
reaching 6.9 percent of GDP, from 6.4 in 2006. Imports increased sharply, especially those of
petroleum products in a context of much higher world prices and increased use of generators
by households and businesses faced with limited electricity supply from the National
Electricity Company (SBEE). On the other hand, the financial account of the balance of
payments improved as a result of higher official capital flows in the form of concessional
loans, but also sustained by rising foreign assets for commercial banks; the latter reflecting,
inter alia, higher off-budget donor support. Consequently, the overall balance of payments
recorded a surplus of 3.2 percent of GDP, which helped maintain official reserves at a level
equivalent to some 15 months of imports.
4.
In 2007, continued fiscal consolidation in a context of limited absorption
capacity led to a further strengthening of the basic fiscal balance. More efforts were
made to enhance domestic revenue collection, while spending was broadly contained within
program limits despite overruns in various transfer items. Total revenue increased to the
equivalent to 20.6 percent of GDP, compared with 16.8 percent in 2006 and 19 percent of
GDP under the program. At the same time, total basic outlays were limited to 17.6 percent of

39
GDP (compared with a targeted 18 percent under the program), reflecting lower-thanprogrammed capital expenditure—as the authorities facing inadequate capacity in project
design, implementation, and monitoring, remained confronted with difficulties (institutional
and administrative) in the management of the investment budget. Consequently, the surplus
on the basic fiscal balance increased to the equivalent of 3 percent of GDP (0.4 percent in
2006), compared with a target of 1 percent under the program.
5.
Customs revenue performance exceeded program objectives. Receipts totaled
CFAF 250.1 billion or 9.4 percent of GDP, compared with 8.4 percent in 2006. The
improvement was attributable to a strengthening of governance, intensification of anti-fraud
activities at land borders, and improved valuation of imports. Customs administration also
endeavored to simplify imports clearance procedures and formalities, and enhanced the
monitoring of exemptions. The improved customs revenue performance was also
underpinned by a substantial increase in the value of imports.
6.
Domestic direct and indirect tax revenue also rose considerably, reaching
CFAF 197 billion or 7.4 percent of GDP, from 6.9 percent in 2006. This was, however,
0.2-percentage point below target; but reflecting continued efforts to improve tax
administration, with a focus on the Large Taxpayer Unit (DGE) and the Medium-Sized
Enterprise Tax Centers (CIMEs). These units’ activities are now squarely centered on
monitoring the fiscal obligations of the largest businesses, representing over 80 percent of the
tax base. On the other hand, as part of the effort to standardize management of the tax on
industrial and commercial profits (BIC), big enterprises under DGE purview are no longer
subject to the tax withholding system under which advance payments on profit taxes (AIB)
were collected at customs. This is helping reduce the large tax credits accumulated in the last
years, gradually easing related tax management and collection problems. The relatively high
VAT yield resulted from intensified controls in monitoring the tax base and securing
collection.
7.
In 2007, nontax revenue exceeded by far the program target and significantly
contributed to the increase in government receipts. The gains stemmed mostly from oneoff license fees from mobile telephone companies, in an amount totaling CFAF 61 billion
(2.3 percent of GDP).
8.
Government expenditure was broadly within program limits, reaching
CFAF 585.3 billion or 22 percent of GDP, compared with a projected 22.6 percent under the
program. Current spending was marked by sizable overruns in various transfer items,
reflecting government support to the microfinance and crisis-afflicted energy sectors. Other
current outlays, including the wage bill, were contained within program limits. Domestically
financed capital expenditure was one percentage point of GDP below target, corresponding to
an implementation rate of 69 percent (57 percent in 2006).

40

9.
The overall fiscal deficit (commitment basis, excluding grants) was reduced
to 1.4 percent of GDP (compared with the programmed 3.7 percent of GDP), settling at
CFAF 69.4 billion. The bulk of budgetary support, in the form of program assistance, was
granted by: (i) the World Bank: CFAF 15.3 billion; (ii) the European Union:
CFAF 11.7 billion; (iii) the African Development Bank: CFAF 11 billion; and (iv) The
Netherlands: CFAF 6.6 billion.
10.
Monetary developments were dominated by a sharp increase in money supply,
resulting from a buildup of external reserves and a rapid expansion of credit to the
economy. Net credit to the government further declined, with a considerable increase in
Treasury deposits reflecting the improvement of the budgetary situation and expansion of
government’s overall resources envelope. By and large, developments in the monetary sector
were in line with those in both the real sector and balance of payments. The central bank
maintained the required reserve ratio at 15 percent.
II. PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION
11.
All quantitative performance criteria and benchmarks for end-December 2007
were observed. In the structural area, only two of four benchmarks were observed. In
particular, although the single taxpayer identification number system was introduced and the
study on the effectiveness of customs was completed, the audit of public expenditure
management information systems and the reform strategy for the civil service pension fund
are still pending.
III. ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL POLICIES IN 2008
A. Macroeconomic Framework
12.
The government is determined to consolidate the economic recovery under way
and to put the economy on a path of strong and sustainable growth. To that end, it will
take steps to anchor recent gains in macroeconomic stabilization, strengthen economic and
social infrastructure, and expedite the structural reform agenda. In the circumstances, the
medium-term economic outlook remains positive, with real GDP growth projected
at 5.3 percent in 2008, and inflation contained within the limits of the WAEMU convergence
criterion. Domestically financed public capital outlays would amount to 3.5 percent of GDP
in 2008, one percentage-point above the average for the past two years.
13.
The government remains committed to market-based price policies. In light of
current price increases for key commodities such as rice, wheat, cement, and petroleum
products, the government introduced selected price control measures in the last quarter

41
of 2007. In particular, it suspended or reduced customs duty rates for concerned products; and
made subsidy transfers to the state-owned electricity (SBEE) and petroleum distribution
(SONACOP) companies in a bid to keep in check increases in retail energy product prices.
The government intends to lift these measures as soon as possible. To encourage domestic
production and supply of essential goods, in particular for food products, the government is
committed to ensuring that food prices do reflect production costs over the medium to long
term. Consequently, going forward, should current price pressures persist, the government
intends to make use of consumption subsidies to targeted social groups instead. To that
effect, it will establish social safety nets with technical assistance from development partners,
as needed.
14.
Serious risks weigh on the economy in 2008. In the short run, the risks relate mostly
to the impact of an appreciating Euro-pegged CFA franc, rising prices of petroleum and other
key consumer products, and heightened wage demands from trade unions. Over the medium
term, delays in implementing structural reforms in the cotton, electricity, and
telecommunications sectors would also affect macroeconomic developments. These risks are,
however, offset, at least in part, by the positive effects of trade with the oil-based Nigerian
economy.
B. Fiscal Policy
15.
In 2008, fiscal policy is aimed at preserving recent gains in macroeconomic
stabilization, helping to improve absorption capacity, and supporting the economic
recovery. To that end, total government revenue and expenditure would reach 18.4 percent
of GDP and 22.8 percent of GDP, respectively. The surplus on the basic fiscal balance would
be equivalent to ½ percent of GDP, meeting the WAEMU target with some margin. It is
anticipated that the overall fiscal deficit (commitment basis and excluding grants) would be
contained at a level equivalent to 4.4 percent of GDP. Fiscal consolidation would thus be
pursued, and spending on infrastructure and poverty reduction programs would further
increase, as absorption capacity is enhanced.
16.
Government revenue is expected to total CFAF 530.1 billion or 18.4 percent of
GDP, taking account of 1 percent of GDP in losses from fiscal measures to address
rising food and oil prices. 1 In addition to the impact of increased import volumes on
customs revenue, the performance is attributable to several recently introduced measures to
broaden the tax base, including: (i) establishment of a single taxpayer identification number
system, (ii) strengthening of tax and customs control administration units, (iii) expansion of
CIMEs, (iv) enhanced monitoring of VAT returns at the Large Taxpayer Unit, (v) more
1

Elimination of customs tariffs and/or reduction of customs fees for imports of key food items and for
petroleum products.

42
rigorous post-customs clearance monitoring of exemptions, and (vi) extension of
ASYCUDA++ to several provincial customs posts.
17.
Spending is projected at CFAF 656.8 billion in 2008, corresponding to an
increase of 12.2 percent. This would help meet the annual cost of the economic and social
infrastructure rehabilitation program that started in 2007; it also takes account the wage
increase granted to public sector teachers. Overall, the wage bill would increase to the
equivalent of 5.7 percent of GDP to meet the urgent personnel needs of the key sectors of
education and health, agriculture, and the revenue agencies. In the medium term, the
government plans to maintain the wage bill at levels consistent with the ceiling under the
program, and to contain wage outlays at 5.5 percent of GDP. Capital expenditure is projected
to total CFAF 230.3 billion or about 8 percent of GDP. The government will continue settling
the outstanding wage debt to civil servants, including through securitization as needed.
18.
The overall fiscal deficit (cash basis, excluding grants) is projected at 5.1 percent
of GDP. It is to be financed mainly with budgetary support from the European Union and
other bilateral and multilateral partners, including the World Bank, the African Development
Bank.
19.
The government continues ongoing efforts to preserve fiscal discipline and
improve public expenditure management. To enhance the quality of spending, the
government remains committed to ensuring the strict observance of established expenditure
execution procedures, and would resort to exceptional spending channels only sparingly. In
particular, the use of Treasury payment orders (ordres de paiement Trésor) will continue to
be limited to a strict minimum. The government is also taking steps to enhance its capacity to
absorb mobilized resources. To this end, it is increasing the personnel and material means at
the disposal of key spending ministries, with a special emphasis on units responsible for
managing the investment budget. In this vein, the programming and forecasting directorates
of the line ministries will be reinforced, and efforts are under way to improve the
effectiveness of the National Procurement Regulatory Committee (CNRMP) and the National
Public Procurement Directorate (DNMP), as well as the performance of procurement units
(CPMPs) in the technical ministries.
C. Money and Credit
20.
Monetary policy conducted at the regional level by the BCEAO will continue to
seek preservation of price stability, a strengthening of the zone’s external position, and
maintenance of international reserves at an adequate level. Broad money is expected to
grow by 8.3 percent in 2008, in line with the increase in nominal GDP, with net foreign
assets and credit to the private sector increasing by 2.1 percent and 6.7 percent of beginningof-period money supply, respectively. Continuing a recent trend, net bank credit to the

43
government is projected to decline slightly, as public finance improves further, facilitating an
expansion of credit to the private sector.
21.
In setting the required reserve ratio, the authorities will continue to take account
of developments on the inflation and short-term credit fronts. Given that credit growth
and inflation are expected to be relatively moderate in 2008, a lowering of the required
reserve ratio from the current high of 15 percent could be envisaged, especially in the absence
of risks of capital flight, and assuming no significant deterioration in the quality of
commercial bank portfolio.
22.
Despite a surge in activity during 2006–07, the banking sector remains
vulnerable. Deposits increased by nearly 30 percent in 2007 and bank credit rose
by 26 percent. However, three of the country’s twelve banks accounted for more
than 60 percent of bank deposits in 2006-07; and four institutions bore 80 percent of nonperforming loans (NPLs) in 2007. These increased by 8 percent in 2007, accounting
for 9 percent of total bank loans. In the circumstances, the low level of bank capitalization
has limited commercial banks’ ability to observe certain prudential ratios. In December 2007,
eight of Benin’s twelve banks did not observe the minimum capital adequacy requirement,
compared with six (out of twelve) in December 2006; but the decision to raise the required
minimum capital is expected to correct this weakness in 2008. None of the twelve banks
observed the portfolio structure ratio. Concerned about this situation, the government is
carefully monitoring implementation of the decision to adjust the minimum capital
requirement; it is also closely working with the National Assembly to ensure an early
ratification of the regional agreement enhancing the supervisory powers of the WAEMU
Banking Commission.
23.
Recent bank supervision missions by the Banking Commission have highlighted
a number of remedial measures to address key weaknesses in the banking system.
Improvements are especially needed in the areas of corporate governance, information
systems, risk management, downgrading of loans, and loss accounting.
D. Balance of Payments and External Debt
24.
In 2008, the external current account deficit, excluding grants, is expected to
widen to 7.5 percent of GDP, from 6.9 percent in 2007. For the most part, this would
reflect the impact of higher oil and food prices, notwithstanding the relatively good
performance of cotton exports, and a revival of net re-exports, the upshot of reforms under
way at the port of Cotonou. Imports of intermediate and capital goods would also somewhat
go up in the face of higher public investment demand and stronger private sector activity in
several areas. As a result of private financial flows related to these developments, but also
reflecting anticipated program and project grants and loans, the balance of payments is

44
expected to show a slight surplus in 2008, which would permit Benin to contribute to
programmed build-up in BCEAO reserves.
25.
The government remains committed to pursuing a prudent debt policy, which is
key to ensuring preservation of external debt sustainability. It intends to put the proceeds
of loans contracted to good use, in support of its growth objectives and with a view to
enhancing availability of basic social services in the country.
E. Structural Policies
Public expenditure management
26.
The government is making determined efforts to improve public expenditure
management. After being granted debt relief under both the HIPC Initiative and MDRI,
Benin is making increasing gains in domestic revenue mobilization. The government is
determined to ensure adequate use of the fiscal space thus created. To this end, it intends to
expedite efforts to modernize public expenditure management systems, with a view to
enhancing their effectiveness.
27.
Improving budget management remains a priority. The actions envisaged in this
area include, in particular, the preparation of an audit of the automated public expenditure
management systems (SIGFIP, ASTER, and WMONEY). The audit was initially scheduled
to be completed before end-December 2007 (a structural benchmark in the program), a
deadline missed because of delays in mobilizing needed external financing. With support
from the European Union now secured, the government has issued an invitation to bid for the
recruitment of a consultant of international repute that is to carry out the audit by endDecember 2008 (reset structural benchmark). Implementation of recommendations would
make monitoring of expenditure execution more reliable. In the same context, the
government is determined to expedite preparation of two delayed strategies to : (i) address the
deteriorating financial situation of the civil service pension fund, an end-December 2007
structural benchmark; and (ii) improve public expenditure management—a structural
benchmark for end March 2008. The two strategies are now to be finalized by endDecember 2008 (reset structural benchmarks). Steps have been taken to ensure that Budget
and Treasury officials assume more fully responsibility for monitoring implementation of
these program benchmarks.
28.
The government has initiated actions to improve management of the investment
budget. It is determined to ensure that capital outlays do Benin’s growth objectives and, to
that end, is working to address capacity constraints that have prevented implementation of
more ambitious public investment programs. This is key to the success of the government’s
economic and social infrastructure rehabilitation program. In this context, the human and

45
material resources at the disposal of public investment management units, including in the
area of procurement, are being increased. At the same time, the government is endeavoring to
enhance its project design, implementation, and monitoring capacity; and has taken steps to
further strengthen the monitoring of investment projects in the technical ministries. In this
context, bi-monthly project execution reports are to be submitted to the Council of Ministers
and posted on the website of the Office of the President of the Republic.
Reforms of the cotton, energy, and telecommunications sectors
The government is preparing a comprehensive strategy for reform of the cotton
29.
sector. Despite government willingness to secure enhanced private sector involvement in
cotton ginning activities, state disengagement from SONAPRA was not achieved in 2007,
owing in part to limited private sector interest. Drawing the lessons, the government has
initiated preparations for an in-depth strategy that should reassert the government’s plan to
disengage from industrial and commercial activities, and more generally make reform
recommendations likely to help enhance the efficiency and competitiveness of the cotton
sector.
The new cotton sector reform strategy is expected to be completed by end30.
December 2008. The government intends to develop its strategic pillars in the second quarter
of 2008, and to conduct participatory consultations with key stakeholder groups in the third
quarter of the year with a view to securing broad-based ownership of proposed efficiencyenhancing reforms. Following adoption of the reform package at end-December 2008, agreed
reform measures would be implemented over a 2-3 year period.
31.
Reform of the energy sector will continue. It is critical for nurturing
competitiveness. The initial deadline for effecting state divestiture by January 2009 had not
fully taken into account the actual operating conditions at the national electric power
company (SBEE). Recent investigations have uncovered numerous administrative, financial,
accounting, technical, and commercial irregularities in company management. As result,
restructuring had become essential for ensuring successful state divestiture; and
implementation of a two-year SBEE restructuring program has been under way since
January 2008.
32.
The government plans to conduct an overall assessment of the SBEE
restructuring program in December 2009 with a view to defining content and timing of
state divestiture. Special emphasis is to be placed on capacity building needs to provide the
company with competent technical and managerial staff. The government is counting on
support from the Bretton Woods institutions in carrying out agreed reforms for the sector.

46
33.
Power production and transport will be the subject of a national strategy to be
developed in the coming months. The production and distributing of electric power require
heavy investments. The sector will be the subject of a national strategy that is to be developed
taking account of the findings of ongoing work by a subregional committee tasked by the
WAEMU heads of state with finding solutions to the region’s severe energy crisis.
34.
Opening up the equity capital of the national telecommunications company
(Bénin Télécoms SA) is a government priority. The telecommunications sector has been
reorganized, in particular with respect to the GSM mobile telephone system. A transitional
regulatory authority has been set up and is effectively exercising its oversight prerogatives,
especially in the area of international communications. As regards Bénin Télécoms SA,
implementation of a restructuring program endorsed in December 2006 by the company’s
main creditors and approved by the government, is under way. It is to be completed in
January 2009. A strategy note on state disengagement is being prepared, and is expected to be
submitted to government approval in the second quarter of 2008. In view of extensive
preparatory work following government adoption of the strategy, the call for bids from
potential private sector investors could be issued in the second half of 2009.
Port sector reform

47
35.
With support from MCA-Benin, the government is continuing implementation
of measures to enhance the competitiveness of the Autonomous Port of Cotonou. Key
strategic areas of port reform include measures to enhance private sector involvement in
management, and to improve customs effectiveness in mobilizing revenue and facilitating
trade. The government completed on March 20, 2008, a review of bids pertaining to the
recruitment of a port expert that is to help modernize port operations. As anticipated under
the program, the expert is to become operational by end-June 2008. Also, the government has
completed a study on the efficiency of Benin’s customs operations. The study stresses the
need for a one-stop shop at the port, which the government intends to set up, complete with a
consolidated electronic billing system (BFU), by end-September 2008. These actions would
help increase the fluidity of foreign trade and improve customs revenue collection.
F. Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (GPRSP)
36.
The government has started preparations for the 2007 annual progress report
(APR) on the implementation of the 2007–09 PRSP. The report’s terms of reference have
been drawn up, and the government is making every effort to take account of the relevant
comments from development partners. It intends to have the APR finalized by endJune 2008.
IV. MONITORING OF PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION
37.
Program monitoring will be effected on the basis of quarterly quantitative and
structural performance criteria and benchmarks (Tables 1 and 2). The authorities will
report the data necessary for program monitoring to the IMF, in accordance with relevant
requirements under the Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU). Over the program
period, the authorities will neither introduce restrictions on payments and transfers on current
international transactions, nor tighten any such restrictions, without first consulting the Fund;
introduce or modify multiple currency practices; conclude bilateral payments agreements not
compatible with the provisions of Article VIII of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement; or
introduce restrictions on imports for balance of payments purposes.
38.
The fifth and sixth reviews under the PRGF arrangement will take place by endNovember 2008 and end-April 2009, respectively.

APPENDIX I. ATTACHMENT II—BENIN: TECHNICAL MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
May 2008
1.
This technical memorandum of understanding defines the quantitative and structural
performance criteria and benchmarks for the program supported by the Poverty Reduction
and Growth Facility (PRGF). It also sets out the frequency and deadlines for data reporting to
the staff of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for program-monitoring purposes.
I. DEFINITIONS
2.
Unless otherwise indicated, the government is defined as the central government of
the Republic of Benin and does not include local authorities, the central bank, or any other
public entity with autonomous legal personality that is not included in the table of
government financial operations (TOFE).
3.
The definitions of “debt” and “concessional borrowing” for the purposes of this
memorandum of understanding are as follows:
(a).
As set out in Point 9 of the Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to
Foreign Borrowing (Executive Board Decision No. 6230-(79/140), amended by Executive
Board Decision No. 12274-(00/85) (8/24/00), debt is understood to mean a current, that is,
not contingent, liability created under a contractual agreement through the provision of value
in the form of assets (including currency) or services, and which requires the obligor to make
one or more payments in the form of assets (including currency) or services at some future
points in time; these payments will discharge the principal and/or interest liabilities incurred
under the contract. Debt can take a number of forms, the primary ones being as follows:
(i) loans, that is, advances of money to the obligor by the lender on the basis of an
undertaking that the obligor will repay the funds in the future (including deposits, bonds,
debentures, commercial loans, and buyers’ credits) and temporary exchanges of assets that
are equivalent to fully collateralized loans, under which the obligor is required to repay the
funds, and usually pay interest, by repurchasing the collateral from the buyer in the future
(such as repurchase agreements and official swap arrangements); (ii) suppliers’ credits, that
is, contracts where the supplier permits the obligor to defer payment until some time after the
date on which the goods are delivered or services are provided; and (iii) leases, that is,
arrangements under which property is provided that the lessee has the right to use for one or
more specified period(s) of time, that are usually shorter than the total expected service life of
the property, while the lessor retains the title to the property. For the purpose of this
guideline, the debt is the present value (at the inception of the lease) of all lease payments
expected to be made during the period of the arrangement, excluding those payments that
cover the operation, repair, or maintenance of the property. Under this definition of debt set

51
out above, arrears, penalties, and judicially awarded damages arising from failure to make
payment under a contractual obligation that constitutes debt are debt. Failure to make
payment on an obligation that is not considered debt under this definition (e.g., payment on
delivery) will not give rise to debt.
(b).
A loan is considered concessional if, on the date the contract is signed, the ratio of
the present value of the loan, based on the reference interest rates, to the nominal value of the
loan is less than 65 percent (i.e., a grant element exceeding 35 percent). The reference interest
rates used in this assessment are the commercial interest reference rates (CIRRs) established
by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). For debts with a
maturity exceeding 15 years, the ten-year reference interest rate published by the OECD is
used to calculate the grant element. For shorter maturities, the six-month market reference
rate is used.
II. QUANTITATIVE PERFORMANCE CRITERIA
A. Ceiling on Net Domestic Financing of the Government
Definition
66..
Net domestic financing of the government is defined as the sum of (i) net bank credit
to the government, as defined below, and (ii) net nonbank financing of the government,
including the proceeds from the sale of government assets net of the cost of structural reforms
to which these proceeds are earmarked, including government treasury bills issued in CFAF
on the regional financial market of the WAEMU.
77..
Net Bank credit to the government is defined as the balance between the liabilities
and claims of the government vis-à-vis the central bank and commercial banks. The scope of
net credit to the government is that used by the Central Bank of West African States
(BCEAO) and is consistent with the established Fund practice in this area. It implies a
broader definition of government than that specified in paragraph 2. Claims of the
government include the CFA franc cash balance, postal checking accounts, subordinated debt
(obligations cautionnées), and all deposits with the BCEAO and commercial banks of public
entities, with the exception of industrial or commercial public entities (EPIC) and public
enterprises, which are excluded from the calculation. Government debt to the banking system
includes all debt to these same financial institutions.
88..
The net bank credit to the government and the net amount of government treasury
bills and bonds issued in CFAF in the regional financial market of the WAEMU are
calculated by the BCEAO, and nonbank financing is calculated by the Beninese Treasury,
whose figures are those deemed valid in the context of the program.

52

99..
The ceiling on the net domestic financing of the government will be adjusted if
disbursement of external budgetary assistance (excluding IMF financing and HIPC
assistance) net of debt service obligations (excluding IMF repayment obligations) and
payments of arrears, exceed or fall short of program forecasts. In the event of disbursement in
larger than programmed amounts, the ceiling will be adjusted downward pro tanto by the
excess disbursement, unless they are used to absorb domestic arrears. In contrast, if at the end
of each quarter disbursements are less than the programmed amounts, the ceiling will be
raised pro tanto by the amount of the shortfalls up to the limit (on a noncumulative basis) of
CFAF 4.5 billion at end-June 2008, CFAF 10 billion at end-September 2008, and CFAF 18
billion at end-December 2008. The amount of external budgetary assistance provided is
calculated from end-March 2008 onward. Budgetary assistance is defined as grants, loans,
and debt relief (excluding project loans and grants, IMF resources, and debt relief under the
enhanced Initiative for Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC Initiative) and the
Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI)).
Performance criteria and indicators
The ceiling on net domestic financing of the government is established as follows:

member qualifies for such debt relief.
_________________
Decision point - point at which the IMF and the World Bank determine whether a country
qualifies for assistance under the HIPC Initiative and decide on the amount of assistance to be
committed.
Interim assistance - amount disbursed to a country during the period between decision and
completion points, up to 20 percent annually and 60 percent in total of the assistance committed at
the decision point (or 25 percent and 75 percent, respectively, in exceptional circumstances).
Completion point - point at which a country receives the remaining balance of its assistance
committed at the decision point, together with an additional disbursement of interest income as
defined in footnote 2 above. The timing of the completion point is linked to the implementation of
pre-agreed key structural reforms (i.e., floating completion point).

IX. Safeguards Assessments:
The Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) is the common central bank of the
countries of the West African Economic and Monetary Union, which includes Benin. The
most recent safeguards assessment of the BCEAO was completed on November 4, 2005. The
assessment indicated progress has been made in strengthening the bank's safeguards
framework since the 2002 assessment and identified some areas where further steps would
help solidify it.
The BCEAO now publishes a full set of audited financial statements and improvements have
been made to move financial reporting closer to International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRS). Furthermore, an internal audit charter has been put in place, mechanisms for
improving risk management have been established, and follow-up on internal and external
audit recommendations has been strengthened.
The results of continuous safeguards monitoring indicate that while certain vulnerabilities
remain in internal control systems and legal structure, there has been some progress in other
areas, including through: (i) improving the external audit process by adopting a multi-year
audit program; (ii) establishing an audit committee; (iii) expanding disclosures on financial
positions of WAEMU countries with the Fund in the notes to the annual financial statements;
and (iv) further strengthening of the effectiveness of the internal audit function.
X.

Exchange Arrangement:

Benin is a member of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) and has
no separate legal tender. The union’s common currency, the CFA franc, is pegged to the Euro
at a rate of CFAF 655.957 = EUR 1, consistent with the official conversions rate of the
French franc to the Euro and the previous fixed rate of the CFA franc to the French franc of
CFAF 100= F 1. On April 28, 2006, the rate of the CFA franc in terms of SDR was CFAF
769.68 = SDR 1.0. Effective January 1, 2007, the exchange arrangement of the WAEMU
countries has been reclassified to the category of conventional pegged arrangement from the
category of exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender. The new classification is
based on the behavior of the common currency, whereas the previous classification was
based on the lack of a separate legal tender. The new classification thus only reflects a
definitional change, and is not based on a judgment that there has been a substantive change
in the exchange regime or other policies of the currency union or its members. The exchange
system common to all member countries of the WAMU is free of restrictions on payments
and transfers for current international transactions subject to Fund jurisdiction.

ROSC Assessment:

An FAD mission conducted the fiscal module of a Report on Observance of Standards and
Codes (ROSC) in May 2001. The mission recommended the adoption of a three-year action
plan containing measures to improve expenditure management. The mission also identified a
list of actions to be taken quickly to ensure that the authorities were able to monitor budget
execution. The ROSC fiscal transparency module for Benin was circulated to the Board on
June 6, 2002 (CR/02/217).

APPENDIX II—RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
Partnership in Benin’s development strategy
1.
Benin’s revised poverty reduction strategy paper (PRSP) was finalized in April 2007
and discussed at the Bank and Fund Boards in June 2007. The PRSP provides a framework
for aligning donor assistance programs, including those of the Bank and the Fund, with the
country’s poverty reduction efforts.
2.
Public expenditure management reform has been an important focus of the Bank’s
assistance program. In close collaboration with the Fund and other donors, the Bank has
provided technical and financial assistance to the government’s reform efforts in this area.
The Bank has also been in the lead in helping Benin strengthen the provision of basic social
services, most importantly in the education and health sectors, pursuing a divestiture program
in the utility and infrastructure sectors, and enhancing the competitiveness of the cotton
sector.
IMF-World Bank collaboration in specific areas
3.
Common objectives and joint support for Benin’s PRSP and the Initiative for Heavily
Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC Initiative) processes have increased collaboration between
the Fund and Bank in recent years. The Bank and Fund teams are closely coordinating their
policy advice to the authorities. There is also close coordination in the determination of
structural conditionality
4.
Private sector development and infrastructure. The Bank has supported Benin’s
program for economic growth through different projects. Assistance for the privatization of
the telecommunications company and for improving the Cotonou port operations is
provided through the Private Sector Development Project. The Bank supports private
participation in the electricity branch of the SBEE through the Energy Services Delivery
Project which was approved by the Bank’s Board on July 6, 2004. The privatization of
SONAPRA’s ginning mills, along with reforms aimed at liberalizing the sector and
strengthening the capacity of producers is supported by the Cotton Sector Project.
5.
Fiscal policy and fiduciary framework. Fiscal consolidation was a key objective of
the Fund-supported PRGF arrangement. The Bank is focusing on improving the efficiency,
transparency and accountability of public expenditures. In addition, the Bank is helping to
strengthen Benin’s fiduciary framework through analytical and advisory activities (AAA),
such as the updates of the Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR) and Country
Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA), and the governance and anti-corruption
survey. The PRSC series also supports a comprehensive action plan for fiduciary and public
procurement reform.

6.
Poverty reduction strategy. Together with other external development partners, the
Bank and Fund have jointly provided assistance to the government in the preparation of
Benin’s revised PRSP. The PRSP was discussed at Bank and Fund Boards in June 2007,
together with a joint staff assessment prepared by Bank and Fund staffs. Both institutions
will continue to jointly advise the authorities on the refinement, implementation, monitoring,
and evaluation of the strategy. The latest PRSP progress report was circulated to Bank and
Fund Boards in June 2008.
7.
Debt sustainability. The Bank and the Fund jointly supported the government’s
efforts to reach the HIPC Initiative completion point in March 2003 and qualification for the
MDRI. In the context of the new PRGF program, Bank and Fund staffs regularly update the
debt sustainability analysis for Benin, in close collaboration with the authorities.
8.
Financial sector policy. The Fund has supported the government’s efforts to
strengthen Benin’s financial sector. As part of the Private Sector Development Project, the
Bank has been providing support to two major microfinance institutions. A financial sector
review was completed and the report was released in July 2004.
World Bank strategy
9.
The overriding objective of the Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)
discussed at its Board on July 3, 2003 is to help Benin reverse the recent trends of limited
poverty reduction and improve economic growth. Progress in reducing poverty and attaining
the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) requires further deepening of cotton sector
reforms, strengthening efforts toward diversifying the economy, making tangible progress in
the social sectors, building effective and responsive public institutions, promoting gender
equality, and strengthening collaboration with the private sector and civil society. The CAS
describes a program of financial assistance and nonlending services as the Bank’s
contribution to addressing these challenges, and it supports the implementation of the PRSP.
A new CAS is scheduled to be prepared in 2008 based on the revised PRSP.
10.
To advance public sector management reforms aimed at increasing efficiency in the
use of public resources, the Bank will continue its support of Benin’s public expenditure
reform through financial and technical support. Annual single-tranche PRSCs are envisaged
to remain a key vehicle for Bank support to the country. A first PRSC was presented to the
Bank’s Board in March 2004, the second in June 2005, the third in November 2006 and the
fourth in June 2007. The series is expected to continue to support the PRSP pillars, with
components on economic growth, service delivery, and governance.
11.
PRSP implementation monitoring has fostered collaboration between the Bank and
other development partners, including civil society organizations. Donors have signaled their
willingness to align their assistance programs to the PRSP and some of them have engaged in
budget support operations, in close coordination with the Bank’s PRSC preparation process.

APPENDIX III—STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of May 1, 2008)
1.
Economic data are broadly adequate for both program monitoring and surveillance,
despite weaknesses in the areas of national accounts, public finance, monetary statistics, and
balance of payments. Benin has participated in the General Data Dissemination System
(GDDS) since 2001. Most sectoral metadata are due to be updated. STA technical assistance
(funded by the Japanese government) is being offered to the eight member countries of the
West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) to assist with implementation of
plans for the improvement of their statistical systems. A Fund regional statistical advisor
initiated a program of assistance in government finance statistics, which is now managed by
the West Africa Regional Technical Assistance Center (AFRITAC West). A real sector
statistics improvement program, conducted in collaboration with the regional statistical office
AFRISTAT initiated in May 2002, is currently being implemented.
Real sector statistics
2.
The country participates in WAEMU’s harmonization of statistical methodologies
through the multilateral surveillance process, currently seeking regional improvements in the
area of national accounts. Under the GDDS project for the AFRITAC West countries to
implement the 1993 SNA, a statistical register and an industrial production index are being
developed. In April 2008, an AFRITAC West mission coincided with the finalization of the
national accounts estimates for 2001. During the mission, a revised work program, including
actions to accelerate the compilation of the revised accounts, was discussed with the
authorities. The national accounts estimates for the new base year are to be disseminated by
end-2008. Consumer prices are measured using the WAEMU harmonized consumer price
index.
Government finance statistics
3.
Monthly and annual government finance statistics are compiled by the Ministry of
Finance (MoF) with a one to three month lag for monthly data, based on information
provided by the budget, customs, tax, and treasury directorates. The MoF prepares a monthly
reconciliation of spending commitments made by the budget directorate and payments made
by the treasury. However, no final budget or treasury accounts are published at the end of the
fiscal year. Data compilation and reporting have been strengthened as a result of a series of
AFRITAC West/STA technical assistance missions and training during the period 2005 to
the present. The authorities provided data for publication in the 2006 and 2007 issues of the
Government Finance Statistics Yearbook (GFSY) The coverage of these data are limited to
the “Budgetary Central Government,” but covering only eight of the principal ministries and
other units of central government.

Monetary and financial statistics
4.
Monetary and financial statistics are compiled and disseminated by the regional
Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO). In response to AFR and STA request, the
BCEAO made substantial revisions in 2005 to the estimates of banknotes in circulation in
member states resulting from cross-border banknote movement. These revisions were due to
changes in the method to estimate currency in circulation in the WAEMU countries. The
revised method, based on updated sorting coefficients (initially established in 1990), has been
applied retroactively from December 2003. The BCEAO is using sorting coefficients to
evaluate the amounts of currency issued by each country, which in turn, are used to estimate
currency in circulation and to adjust the net foreign assets of each member country.
5.
In August 2006, as part of the authorities’ efforts to implement the MFSM’s
methodology, the BCEAO reported to STA test monetary data for June 2006 for all member
countries using Standardized Report Forms (1SR-central bank, 2SR-other depository
corporations, and 5SR-monetary aggregates). In response to STA’s comments on the test
data, the BCEAO has recently provided clarifications but only on the form 1SR. STA’s
efforts to advance the work on SRFs is supported by AFR in the context of its surveillance
work with the WAEMU.
Balance of payments
6.
Since December 1998, the responsibility for compiling and disseminating balance of
payments statistics has been formally assigned to the BCEAO by area-wide legislation
adopted by the countries participating in the WAEMU. The national agency of the BCEAO
in Cotonou is responsible for compiling and disseminating balance of payments statistics,
and the BCEAO headquarters in Dakar for delineating the methodology and calculating the
international reserves managed on behalf of the participating countries.
7.
Data consistency has significantly improved over the past few years, with a full
transition to the Balance of Payments Manual, Fifth Edition (BPM5). The BCEAO national
agency typically disseminates balance of payments statistics with a more than one year lag,
exceeding GDDS guidelines. The BCEAO also compiles and disseminates the annual data of
the international investment position data with an 18-month lag.
8.
Regarding trade data, the ASYCUDA customs computer system is now installed in
all main border customs houses; ASYCUDA ++ is installed in the port and at the airport. The
interconnection between the computer systems of the main departments of Customs has not
been completed yet and the monitoring of import data needs to be stepped up.
9.
Further improvement in the data for services and transfers (especially workers’
remittances) will depend on the intensification of the contacts with reporting bodies. The
authorities’ commitment to strengthen the human and technical resources should be
enhanced.

10.
Concerning the financial account, the foreign assets of the private nonbanking sector
are still not well covered, especially the assets of WAEMU residents, which are obtained
through partial surveys of residents’ foreign assets. The organization of an exhaustive annual
survey of foreign direct investment transactions is still at a very preliminary stage. The
BCEAO has recently updated the compilation of commercial bank data on payments
involving nonresidents; however these data are not used to produce annual balance of
payments estimates, but rather to assess existing information.
11.
A technical assistance mission in November 2004 found that human resources
devoted to balance of payments statistics by the national agency of the BCEAO are
insufficient, but that the reporting system was well developed and consistent. Regarding trade
in goods, and the recording of informal transactions, the statistical adjustments to Customs
data appear methodologically sound; however, the hypotheses and reference bases on which
they rest are largely untested. Other weaknesses in the current account concern the
underestimation of transportation services and overestimation of current transfers. In the
financial account, the coverage of direct investment is poor while unsorted banknotes
impacts on the compilation of net external assets in the balance of payments and international
investment position statistics.
Poverty data
12.
Major methodological weaknesses remain regarding poverty data. In particular, the
methodology used in the household surveys raises concerns about the treatment of the
nonfood expenditure share in the calculation of the poverty line, the division of the country
into 12 agro-ecological zones, and the comparability of poverty statistics across urban and
rural areas and across time. The authorities are implementing an action plan to address these
methodological issues. The authorities have completed a modular survey of household living
conditions to update the poverty profile in the context of the preparation of the second PRSP.
External debt
13.
The Caisse Autonome d'Amortissements (CAA) is responsible for signing
international loan agreements, maintaining the debt database, and servicing the government's
external debt obligations. Since 1995, the CAA has been using the Commonwealth
Secretariat Debt Recording and Management System (CS-DRMS) to record and manage the
debt. For the majority of creditors, the CAA's database is fairly comprehensive and up-todate, and contains accurate stock data, as well as projected debt-service flows, on a loan-byloan basis. For a small number of creditors, however, regular statements are not received.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2008 Article IV Consultation with Benin
On June 16, 2008, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Benin. 1
Background
In the last two years, Benin has experienced a pickup in growth and low inflation
supported by prudent fiscal policies and external debt relief. However, progress in
addressing core economic vulnerabilities has fallen short of expectations, and the
external environment has become less favorable with a strengthening CFA franc adding
to competitiveness concerns and surging food and fuel prices accentuating a deterioration
in the terms of trade. Against this background, real GDP growth reached 4.6 percent in
2007 underpinned by activity in the port, transport and commerce sectors on the strength
of enhanced Cotonou port competitiveness; and by a favorable food harvest. These
factors countered the adverse impact of a regional energy crisis and lower-thanprogrammed cotton output. As a result of comfortable local food availability, average
inflation decelerated to 1.3 percent in 2007, below the West African Economic and
Monetary Union (WAEMU) threshold of 3 percent. This helped to moderate appreciation
of the real effective exchange rate (REER).

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions
with members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and
financial information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments
and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis
for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing
Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and
this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. This PIN summarizes the views of
the Executive Board as expressed during the 6/16/2008 Executive Board discussion
based on the staff report.
1

2

The external current account deficit widened because of terms of trade deterioration and
real currency appreciation. However, thanks to large official capital grant inflows, the
balance of payments recorded a sizable surplus. Driven by strong revenue mobilization,
fiscal performance exceeded expectations in several respects, although public investment
lagged owing to persistent absorptive capacity limitations. At 3 percent of GDP, the
surplus on the narrowly defined primary fiscal balance was 2 percentage points above
target. However, higher food and fuel prices are expected to contribute to a 2.3 percent of
GDP increase in the import bill in 2008 and a widening of the current account deficit.
In 2007, broad money rose by 18 percent, substantially above nominal GDP growth,
driven mostly by donor-supported increases in net foreign assets. Consistent with the
improved budgetary situation and related increases in Treasury deposits in the banking
system, net bank credit to the government contracted, allowing a 26 percent expansion of
credit to the private sector, mostly for commerce, transportation, and telecommunications
activities. Because of the strong credit expansion, the authorities kept the required
reserve ratio at 15 percent to insure against potential inflationary and capital flight
repercussions.
Despite further delays in structural reforms in the cotton and utilities sectors, a revival of
port and other service activities, together with continued, albeit moderate, recovery in
cotton production, is supporting a further strengthening of growth in 2008. Real GDP
growth is expected to inch up to 5.3 percent. However, continuing upward pressures on
oil and food prices are likely to reverse a recent easing of pressures on domestic prices,
causing average inflation to increase to the upper bound of the WAEMU target (possibly
beyond in case of pronounced world oil and food price increases), despite the supply of
domestic foodstuffs remaining generally adequate.
The surplus on the narrowly defined primary budget is projected to decline to 0.5 percent
of GDP in 2008 reflecting, in part, revenue losses from fiscal measures to address rising
oil and food prices. Nevertheless, fiscal prospects continue to benefit from expenditure
and revenue measures aimed at restoring fiscal discipline and expanding the fiscal space
in the post-Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) era. These measures are aimed at
achieving enhanced monitoring of treasury operations, further improving governance in
the revenue agencies, and consolidating hard-won gains in fiscal and customs
administration over the last years with technical assistance from the Fund’s Fiscal Affairs
Department.
Benin’s medium-term economic prospects seem generally favorable, although growth is
likely to continue to fall short of what is required to rapidly reduce poverty. Economic
activity will remain heavily dependent on performance in the port and cotton sectors, with
a pickup in construction and public works supporting domestic demand as the
government rebuilds the economic and social infrastructure. Cotton production and export
growth are projected to remain below potential in view of slow progress in sector reform
and imports of oil and capital goods would grow moderately in real terms due to capacity
limitations, but also reflecting high world prices. Consistent with likely developments in the
latter, the terms of trade are projected to further deteriorate.

3

In the structural area, key medium-term challenges for the authorities are to (i) complete a
comprehensive cotton sector reform strategy by end-2008 and ensure an early
implementation of recommendations, (ii) bring to the point of sale the state-owned
Telecommunications company (Benin Telecoms) in the last quarter of 2009, (iii) finalize
before end-2009 restructuring of the parastatal national electricity company (SBEE) and
develop a reform strategy for the company thereafter. Efforts to further enhance port
competitiveness are continuing, aimed to ensure that the newly recruited external port
expert and auditor become fully operational and to start operation of the port’s one-stop
window for customs procedures clearance in 2008. Other elements of the structural
reform agenda include donor-supported initiatives to improve the efficiency of the legal
and land tenure systems, and to facilitate credit assess to small and medium-sized
enterprises.
A revised Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP II) was completed in 2007. It places a
renewed emphasis on private sector-led economic growth; the authorities are expected to
issue a first annual progress report in the coming weeks.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended Benin’s satisfactory economic performance over the last
two years, marked by low inflation and strengthening economic growth. Directors noted
that Benin was the only WAEMU member country in 2007 to meet the monetary union’s
convergence criterion on the basic fiscal balance.
At the same time, Directors observed that growth continues to fall short of levels required
to achieve significant progress in poverty alleviation, and that core economic
vulnerabilities remain. In particular, rising commodity and food prices are fuelling
inflationary pressures, the external current account is widening because of terms of trade
deterioration and real currency appreciation, and Benin’s weak absorptive capacity
hampers efforts to boost growth.
Noting the slow progress of structural reform, Directors called on the authorities to
invigorate the reform process—particularly in the cotton and public utility sectors—in
order to reduce Benin’s vulnerability to shocks, strengthen external competitiveness,
improve the business environment, and further boost economic growth to accelerate
progress toward the Millennium Development Goals. This will also help unlock donor
financing. In this regard, Directors were encouraged by the authorities’ renewed
commitment to engage in a comprehensive reform agenda.
Directors noted that the fiscal measures taken to address rising food and fuel prices—
namely, reduction of tariffs on certain food and oil imports and subsidies to the electricity
company—have weakened Benin’s budgetary position in 2008. They called on the
authorities to limit the scope and duration of these measures, and supported an early
transition to well-targeted and more fiscally sustainable safety net measures. Directors
encouraged the donor community to provide additional assistance to help Benin cope with
the food and fuel price shock. In this regard, most Directors supported an augmentation of

4

Fund financing to Benin, while some Directors expressed reservations given Benin’s
strong international reserve position.
Directors commended the authorities’ prudent fiscal stance and the implementation of
measures to improve revenue collection and control public spending. They called for
further improvements in public expenditure management, and reiterated that reform of the
civil service pension fund will be essential for achieving medium-term fiscal sustainability.
Directors encouraged the authorities to remove the ceiling on wages as progress is made
on wage management. At the same time, Directors emphasized that project design and
implementation capacity needs to be strengthened to permit higher and more efficient
development and social spending.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to maintaining prudent borrowing policies
in order to preserve external debt sustainability. However, they expressed concern that
substantial borrowing has been undertaken in regional financial markets at high interest
rates, only to result in an accumulation of funds in the banking system because of
capacity constraints on spending.
Directors looked forward to the finalization of the comprehensive reform strategy being
prepared for the cotton sector, and encouraged that the strategy be expeditiously
implemented once it is completed. They called on the authorities to adhere to the new
restructuring timetable for the telecommunications and electricity companies. Directors
welcomed the achievements in port reform, including planned introduction of a one-stop
window for customs clearance, which should help improve port management and
enhance customs effectiveness. Directors also encouraged timely implementation of
measures to strengthen the judicial and land tenure systems and to facilitate further
access to credit for small and medium-sized enterprises.
Directors noted the weaknesses in banking sector indicators, including low capitalization,
maturity mismatches, and high concentrations of credit and non-performing loans. They
welcomed the authorities’ endorsement of key recommendations from the recent WAEMU
Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) mission to improve financial sector
regulation and supervision. Directors supported the recent regional agreement to
strengthen the supervisory authority of the regional Banking Commission, and welcomed
the regional central bank’s efforts to ensure timely observance of agreed higher bank
minimum capital requirements.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Completes Fourth Review Under the PRGF Arrangement with
Benin, Increases Financial Assistance by 150 Percent to Mitigate Food and Fuels Price
Impact, and Approves US$16.4 Million Disbursement
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today completed the fourth
review of Benin's economic performance under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility
(PRGF) arrangement and increased access to financial assistance under the arrangement by
150 percent to help the country deal with rising food and oil prices. The Board agreed to
augment the SDR 6.19 million (about US$10 million) arrangement with SDR 9.29 million
(about US$15 million). The completion of the review enables the disbursement of an amount
equivalent to SDR 10.17 million (about US$16.4 million), including the augmented amount.
The three-year PRGF arrangement was approved on August 5, 2005 (see Press Release
No.05/190) and subsequently extended to August 4, 2009.
In completing the review, Mr. Murilo Portugal, Deputy Managing Director and Acting
Chair, stated:
“Supported by prudent fiscal policies and external debt relief, economic growth in Benin has
picked up and inflation remains low. However, an increasingly less favorable external
environment is likely to complicate the task of raising growth further and reducing poverty
faster. Rising food and fuel prices have further worsened Benin’s terms of trade, pushed up
inflation sharply, and adversely affected vulnerable social groups.
“The authorities are cognizant of the need to consolidate Benin’s recent gains in
macroeconomic stability, as underscored in the country’s Growth Strategy for Poverty
Reduction (GSPR). Nonetheless, in this difficult environment the authorities are allowing a
temporary increase in the fiscal deficit in 2008, through tax cuts and subsidies, to smooth
adjustment to higher food and fuel prices. These measures will be replaced by well-targeted
safety net measures in due course. Over the medium term, full pass-through of food and fuel
price increases to consumers will be key to helping the economy adjust and to foster a
positive agricultural supply response. The Fund is increasing the resources it makes
available to help the authorities to smooth this adjustment.
“The underlying fiscal performance continues to improve with the implementation of
measures to increase revenue and contain spending. Especially noteworthy have been the

2

efforts to improve governance in the revenue agencies and to strengthen tax and customs
administration. The government’s infrastructure rehabilitation program is rebounding,
although capital outlays remain constrained by absorptive capacity limitations. To address
these limitations, the authorities are strengthening the government’s expertise in project
design and implementation. Preservation of fiscal and debt sustainability will require
continued prudent debt management, especially reliance on highly concessional external
financing. These fiscal reform efforts will create increased fiscal space for poverty reduction
and growth-supporting expenditures.
“The structural reform program is moving slowly. The authorities are encouraged to
accelerate implementation of reforms in key sectors in order to reduce core economic
vulnerabilities. A major element of the 2008 structural reform agenda is the completion of a
comprehensive reform strategy for the cotton sector. Also critical are actions to advance
with the restructuring of the state-owned telecommunications and electricity companies.
Reforms in the judicial and land tenure systems will continue to support efforts to facilitate
access to credit for small- and medium-sized enterprises,” Mr. Portugal said.
The PRGF is the IMF's concessional facility for low-income countries. It is intended that
PRGF-supported programs are based on country-owned poverty reduction strategies adopted
in a participatory process involving civil society and development partners and articulated in
a Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). This is intended to ensure that PRGF-supported
programs are consistent with a comprehensive framework for macroeconomic, structural,
and social policies to foster growth and reduce poverty. PRGF loans carry an annual interest
rate of 0.5 percent and are repayable over 10 years with a 5½-year grace period on principal
payments.

Statement by Laurean W. Rutayisire, Executive Director for Benin
June 12, 2008
1. On behalf of my Benin authorities, I would like to thank the Executive Board,
Management and Staff for their continued support to Benin’s efforts towards sustained
reforms and sound macroeconomic policies. I would also like to thank staff for the fruitful
discussions held during their recent visit to Cotonou. The reports tabled for the Board’s
discussion represent a candid assessment of the Beninese economy, and my authorities are
thankful for constructive policy advice therein.
I. Recent Developments
2. Benin’s economic performances under the PRGF-supported program continues to be
broadly satisfactory, as reflected by the observance of all quantitative benchmarks for endSeptember and performance criteria for end-December 2007. With real GDP growth rate at
4.6 percent in 2007 and projected at 5.3 percent in 2008, the Beninese economy is firmly
recovering from its downward trend of 2000- 2005, thanks to the steady resumption of cotton
production, good performance in non-cotton agriculture, and the strong activities in the port
as well as related transport and commerce sectors.
3. The fiscal consolidation engaged by the authorities since 2006 continues to yield positive
results. Following a sustained implementation of reform measures to improve both
governance and efficiency in the tax and customs administration, revenue collection has
increased to 20.6 percent in 2007, outpacing the program target of 17.2 percent. On
expenditure side, the authorities continued to tighten control over spending in line with the
country’s absorptive capacity and the needs to ensure quality. The resulting surplus on the
narrowly defined primary fiscal balance of 3 percent of GDP in 2007, compared to 1 percent
targeted, enabled Benin to meet the WAEMU convergence criterion on the non-negative
narrowly defined fiscal balance.
4. The implementation of fiscal structural reforms also continued to move forward, despite at
slower path than wished by the authorities due partly to difficulties that were initially
unforeseen. Two structural benchmarks for the period under review – namely, the
introduction of Single Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) system and a study of the
efficiency of customs – were completed before end-2007. In addition, appropriate steps have
been taken to ensure successful completion before the year end of the two non-observed
structural benchmarks, namely the audit of PFM information systems and the design of a
strategy for the reform of the civil service pension fund.
5. Owing to prudent monetary policy, as well as to good harvest, average inflation eased at
1.3 percent in 2007, compared to 3.8 percent in 2006. However, the recent surge in food and
fuel prices on the international market and its consequent inflationary pressures pose a threat
to the macroeconomic stability already achieved and complicate the authorities’ structural
reform implementation agenda.

2
6. My authorities attempted to mitigate the impacts of world food price increases, particularly
on vulnerable groups, by temporarily eliminating customs tariffs and reducing customs fees
on highly consumed staple food items as well as through subsidies to the energy utility
company. While the measures were initially designed to end by mid-March 2008, the
persistent international food crisis warranted their continuation whilst government is
designing support mechanisms that better target the poor and help avoid distortions in the
domestic supply of the affected products. In addition, government is searching for long-term
solutions to the crisis, including through regional concerted efforts toward the development
of the agriculture sector. Government have also mobilized financial resources to cover the
revenue loss from the tax cuts and subsidies, but additional resources are still needed,
including from the Fund to help cover the resulting balance of payments financing gaps. My
authorities would much appreciate the approval of the requested support.
II. Policy and Structural Reforms Agenda for 2008 and beyond
7. Over the medium-term, my authorities intend to further push ahead their structural reform
agenda, in order to resolve the challenging obstacles to a strong and sustained economic
growth, to competitiveness and effective poverty reduction. Importantly, Benin authorities
will continue to strengthen public investment, particularly in social, agriculture and
infrastructure sectors, and improve the business climate. In line with these reforms, economic
growth is projected to reach 5.3 percent in 2008 and average 5.5 percent annually through
2011.
8. The authorities intend to achieve the above overall objective through the maintenance of a
prudent fiscal policy over the medium term in line with their PRGF program, which aims
principally at preserving the macroeconomic stability achieved so far. They will strive to
meet the WAEMU fiscal convergence criteria and keep demand-induced inflationary
pressures in check. In 2008, they target a primary budget surplus of 0.5 percent, which in turn
would allow to contain the overall fiscal deficit to equivalent of 4.4 percent of GDP and the
level of debt at sustainable path, whilst effectively responding to expenditure needs
particularly in the social, productive and infrastructure sectors. To this end, my authorities
aim to increase revenue collections to 18.4 percent of GDP by capitalizing on the recently
introduced measures to broaden tax base as well as to further improve governance in the tax
and customs administrations.
9. As a step in pursuing further their fiscal consolidation, the Beninese authorities have
requested Fund’s assistance to help review the country’s tax structure. The findings of the
review would allow the authorities to harmonize their tax rates with regional peers, to find
ways of further enhancing domestic tax performance in light of the expected revenues losses
from the signing of the economic partnership agreements (EPA) with the EU, as well as
streamlining the effectiveness of the tax regime in promoting the development of domestic
private sector. The technical assistance mission in expected in the course of June 2008.
10. On expenditure side, an increase of 12.2 percent is projected to help cater for the
infrastructure rehabilitation program that started in 2007, the recent increase in the salaries of
public sector teachers as well as the new recruitment of public servants to reinforce the

3
capacity of key sectors. At the same time however, a tightened control over current
expenditure will sustain, particularly on goods and services and wage bill. To the later end,
the authorities have reaffirmed their preference to keep the wage ceiling as program
conditionality, along with improvements in payroll systems and progress in the reform of the
civil service pension fund. My authorities will step up efforts to address problems in public
procurement and projects’ management systems. They will also build capacity to conduct
feasibility studies, select and identify sources of financing for key infrastructure projects, and
monitor their implementation. In this context, bi-monthly project execution reports will be
discussed by the Council of Ministers and posted on the President’s Office website.
11. My Benin authorities will continue to adhere to the prudent monetary policy conducted
by the regional central bank BCEAO, which aims at preserving price stability. The Central
bank targets an increase in the broad money at a rate of 8.3 percent equivalent to that of the
nominal GDP in 2008 and the authorities will continue to restrain the net claims of the
banking system on government following expected improvement in the public finances. As
in 2007, this will allow for increase in credit to the private sector.
12. Steps continue to be taken to addressing the current vulnerabilities in the banking
system. Government is carefully monitoring the implementation of the BCEAO decision to
adjust the minimum capital from CFAF 1 billion to 10 billion over three years. Further, it is
working with parliament to speed up the ratification of the regional agreement enhancing the
supervisory powers of the WAEMU Banking Commission. With support from BCEAO
national office, the technical ministry in charge of microfinance is increasing its supervision
capacity, while oversight of large microfinance institutions falls under the BCEAO national
office’s responsibility. An evaluation of financial services demand has been completed under
MCA-Benin’s support. With all these findings as well as those from the recent regional FSA,
the Beninese authorities intend to design a comprehensive strategy for development of the
financial sector, which will help identify additional measures not only to reinforce the
banking sector compliance but also to improve access to credit, especially by small - and
medium-sized enterprises. The development of the financial sector, together with efforts
supported by MCA-Benin to improve land tenure and the legal system, will help in creating
an enabling environment for private sector businesses and diversification of the economy.
13. The implementation of other structural reforms will also continue to move forward,
despite the challenging socio-political environment and insufficient capacity that constrain
the political will of the authorities to accelerate them. With local elections recently
completed, a new impetus to the reform program is expected, including pushing ahead the
administrative and financial decentralization agenda. Furthermore, the authorities are
determined to continue enhancing dialogue on the economic benefits of the structural reform
agenda by further involving participation of stakeholder groups and requesting technical
support from donors.
14. Following the recent disappointing attempt to disengage the state from SONAPRA,
principally due to limited private sector interest, the government is preparing a
comprehensive strategy for the reform of the cotton sector. The new strategy will go
beyond the solely state disengagement from the ginning activities, and tackle all aspects of

4
the production and marketing chains. As an initial step, the government recently decided not
to interfere with the awarding of contracts for importation and distribution of fertilizers and
other inputs. In addition, a Strategic Policy Paper, which gives the main orientations of the
reform, was approved by the Council of Ministers on May 19, 2008. The next step is the
conduct of participatory consultations involving key stakeholder groups with a view to
securing broad-based ownership of the reform. The process for the design of the strategy is
expected to be completed by end-December 2008, while the implementation of the agreed
measures is initially set to extend over a 2-3 year period.
15. Regarding the privatization of Bénin Telecoms, the implementation of its restructuring
plan is under way, as approved by government and endorsed by main creditors. Furthermore,
the policy measures taken by the authorities in 2007 have helped the GSM mobile phone
telecommunication companies to fully resume activities and the interim regulatory authority
– le Conseil Transitoire de Régulation des Postes et Télécommunications – has started to
effectively perform its oversight prerogatives. As for the Société Béninoise d’Electricité et
Energie (SBEE), the implementation of the restructuring is to last 2 years effective from
January 2008 through December 2009, after which the government will make assessment to
determine the nature of privatization.
16. Implementation of reforms to enhance the efficiency and competitiveness of the Port of
Cotonou is advancing well. A “Port Expert”, who will help in the day-to-day management of
the port, is to be operational by end of this month. Further improvement in the port
competitiveness would derive from the effective implementation of the Virtual One-Stop
Shop and the Consolidated Electronic Billing System (Bordereau de Facturation Unique),
which are expected by end-September 2008.
17. My Beninese authorities are thankful to the international community for its continued
support, and for having chosen Benin among the 10 countries for which increased
international support is being planned as part of the UN push to fast-track progress toward
the MDGs. The Government believes that its reform agenda as embedded in the Growth
Strategy for Poverty Reduction Paper (2007-2009) offers an appropriate framework for
channeling the envisaged scaled-up aid. It looks forward to the completion of the assessment
of the macroeconomic implication of the anticipated higher external assistance, expected
later in 2008, as well as to continue working with the donors’ community on building the
country’s capacity for policy design and implementation.
Conclusion
With the above commendable achievements, my authorities have once again demonstrated
their commitment to - and ownership of - policies reforms laid out under the ongoing PRGFsupported program. Though challenges are still daunting, and some of the reforms will take
time to fully yield sustained results, my authorities are committed to pursue their endeavors,
accelerate the pace of the reforms to transform the Beninese economy. In view of the
achievements during the period under review and the continuing commitment of the
authorities to push ahead their reform agenda, I will appreciate the Board's support for the

5
completion of the fourth review, and the approval for the requested augmentation of access
under PRGF, as well as the completion of the 2008 Article IV consultations.
