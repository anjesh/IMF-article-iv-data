JAMAICA
Staff Report for the 2005 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by Staff Representatives for the 2005 Consultation with Jamaica
Approved by Ratna Sahay and Matthew Fisher
March 9, 2006
Context. Jamaica is a large Caribbean economy with a very high debt burden. It has a
complex financial system—banks and securities, insurance, pension, and asset management
companies are all present with sizeable holdings of government debt. The authorities have
adopted a medium-term strategy to reduce the debt burden through fiscal consolidation.
Fund relations. Jamaica is under intensified Fund surveillance. Staff monitor the
implementation of the economic strategy formulated by the authorities without reaching prior
understandings with the Fund. Interim staff reports are issued for information of the
Executive Board in between Article IV consultations. The 2004 Article IV consultation was
concluded by the Executive Board on August 3, 2004. Since then, two interim staff reports
have been issued—the most recent was in June 2005. Jamaica has accepted the obligations of
Article VIII.
Recent developments. Economic performance has been adversely affected by a series of
shocks. Real GDP contracted sharply in late 2004 following the devastating effects of
Hurricane Ivan. Thereafter, while there has been an economic recovery, it was weakened by
a drought as well as the remarkably active and severe 2005 hurricane season. Inflation picked
up sharply due to rising agricultural prices and pass-through of high international oil prices,
but it has declined somewhat recently. The fiscal targets under the authorities’ program have
not been met.
Discussions. A staff team comprising Sanjaya Panth (Head), Rodolphe Blavy,
Goohoon Kwon and Rafael Romeu (all WHD), and Piyabha Kongsamut (PDR) held
discussions in Kingston during December 1–14. The mission met with Finance Minister
Omar Davies, Bank of Jamaica Governor Derick Latibeaudiere, Financial Secretary
Colin Bullock, other senior officials, and representatives of the private sector and the
opposition. Ms. Sahay (WHD), Mr. Corker (MFD and mission chief for the FSAP), and
Mr. Campbell (OED) joined the team for the final discussions.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Jamaica is a large Caribbean economy with a high debt burden and a record of
relatively low economic growth. Public debt currently stands at about 135 percent of
GDP but has remained high throughout the past 15 years. The high debt burden has
rendered the economy vulnerable to swings in market sentiment and contributed to high
and volatile inflation as well as low economic growth. It has also placed severe
constraints on the flexibility of macroeconomic policies.
There have been political changes recently and parliamentary elections are due by
2007. On February 25, 2006, Ms. Portia Simpson Miller, Minister for Local Government
in the current cabinet, emerged victorious in a close contest for the presidency of the
governing People’s National Party (PNP) and is expected to be appointed Prime Minister.
The PNP will face the opposition Jamaica Labor Party (which itself underwent a
leadership change in 2005) in the next parliamentary elections.
Recent economic performance has been adversely affected by a series of shocks.
Real GDP contracted sharply in late 2004 following the devastating effects of
Hurricane Ivan. Thereafter, the incipient economic recovery was weakened by a drought
and a remarkably active and severe hurricane season in 2005. Agricultural prices soared
and, with the pass-through of high international oil prices to the domestic economy,
contributed to an upsurge of inflation, which peaked in September 2005 but has since
moderately declined. The authorities’ FY 2005/06 fiscal targets have not been met so far.
Recent economic policies have been guided by a medium-term socio-economic policy
framework adopted by the government in early 2004. The authorities’ economic
strategy under this framework, which continues to enjoy broad popular and donor
support, has been to seek to reduce public debt from over 140 percent of GDP in
FY 2003/04 to around 100 percent by FY 2008/09. A centerpiece of the strategy was the
balanced budget objective for the current fiscal year.
The discussions focused on the needed policy response to recent developments as
well as to the long-term challenges confronting the economy. The authorities remain
determined to limit the temporary fiscal deficits and regain a balanced budget over the
medium term. The staff suggested eliminating deficits sooner if the economy improves.
On monetary policy, the interest rate differential vis-à-vis the United States has narrowed
and staff advised that action be taken preemptively to confront pressures in the capital
account. To enhance growth and mitigate risks, the authorities were encouraged to
continue with structural reforms, including with respect to taxation and financial sector
strengthening. On the latter, the authorities noted the FSAP’s favorable assessment of the
steps taken so far and their intention to continue with reforms.

I. BACKGROUND AND PERSPECTIVE
1.
Jamaica is one of the larger Caribbean economies, with income somewhat below
the regional average. As the third-most populous Fund member country in the region and
the largest among the 12 English-speaking independent Caribbean nations, Jamaica occupies
a preeminent position in the region but its economic performance has generally lagged that of
its neighbors. As a result, per capita income is lower than the regional mean. Jamaica also
fares relatively low on human development indicators, although life expectancy and poverty
rates are better than in most other countries in the Caribbean.

2.
A salient feature of the economy during the past 15 years has been the crushing
public debt burden. In the early 1990s, debt was reduced significantly through Paris Club
reschedulings and fiscal adjustments under Fund-supported programs, the last of which
expired in March 1996. Following a severe banking crisis that same year, the government
eventually assumed financial sector liabilities amounting to about 40 percent of GDP
(Figure 1). In 1997, coincident with elections, the fiscal performance also deteriorated. Since
then, Jamaica has been grappling with a legacy of debt averaging between 130–145 percent
of GDP. This debt has rendered the economy vulnerable to market sentiments and
contributed to high and volatile inflation as well as low economic growth.
3.
Going forward, the room for policy maneuverability is very limited. The mix
between local currency and dollar-denominated debt, and the significant reliance on variable
rate instruments, render the debt sensitive to exchange rate as well as interest rate changes
(Figure 2, first panel). Both the debt stock and the interest bill are among the highest in the
world (second panel) and to help meet the debt service, primary surpluses of 11–12 percent
of GDP were generated over the past two fiscal years. This has required high levels of
taxation and put a severe squeeze on non-interest expenditures (third panel), particularly
capital expenditures, constraining the flexibility of fiscal policy. As regards monetary policy,
demand for the Jamaican dollar is low—real base money has been declining and is exceeded
by the outstanding stock of central bank bills (fourth panel). Inflation is high despite
seignorage averaging just about 1 percent of GDP per year (fifth panel) and, in real terms,
central bank losses have exceeded the growth of base money, resulting in upward pressures
on debt, since central bank losses are taken over by the government (final panel). Under such

circumstances, the authorities’ pursuit of multiple objectives—reduce debt, support growth
and contain inflation—have severely complicated the task of conducting monetary policy.
4.
In recent years, the authorities’ policies have largely been consistent with Fund
advice. In the wake of financial turbulence in 2003, the authorities announced a medium–
term strategy for debt reduction and have implemented fiscal policy towards achieving this
goal. A comprehensive tax review was carried out and some reforms were initiated, albeit in
a piecemeal fashion, under the FY 2005/06 budget. On exchange rates, the Fund has
advocated greater flexibility to absorb shocks and maintain competitiveness and the rate has
been allowed to move in recent years.
5.
With the recent change of leadership in the governing party, attention is shifting
towards national elections to be held by 2007. The People’s National Party (PNP), led by
Prime Minister P. J. Patterson starting in 1992, has been in office since 1989. Mr. Patterson
had earlier announced his intention to step down and on February 25, 2006, Ms. Simpson
Miller, Local Government Minister in the current cabinet, emerged victorious in a close
contest for the leadership of the PNP. Other contenders for the Party Presidency had included
National Security Minister Phillips and Finance and Planning Minister Davies. In line with
tradition, Ms. Simpson Miller is soon expected to be appointed Prime Minister—
Mr. Patterson has indicated that he will remain in office for another four to five weeks to
ensure a smooth transition. The next parliamentary elections are due by October 2007. The
opposition Jamaica Labor Party (JLP), which controls most local governments, has also
recently undergone a leadership change—Mr. Bruce Golding took over in 2005 from
Mr. Seaga, who had led the party for 30 years.

Shocks continued to sap the economic recovery following Hurricane Ivan in 2004

Inflation remains high and volatile—accelerating sharply through to September
2005 due to the supply shocks but falling thereafter. Consumer prices registered a
marked increase at end-2004 in the aftermath of Hurricane Ivan. Thereafter, annual
headline inflation continued to pick up, reaching a high of 19 percent in September
2005, before falling back to 13 percent at end-2005. This compares to an outcome of
20

13¾ percent a year earlier
and the authorities’ target for

The external current account balance weakened on account of the shocks, with
some reversal in capital flows occurring during the second half of 2005. Export
performance weakened because of crop damage while imports shot up mainly due to
higher oil prices. As regards the capital account, the government successfully tapped

Available indicators suggest that aggregate demand has remained weak. Public
consumption has fallen in recent years due to the strong efforts at fiscal consolidation.
Private demand was anemic during 2004 and has continued to remain so as indicated
by recent weaknesses in consumption taxes and the consumer confidence index. As a

flooding and infrastructure damage associated with the 2005 hurricanes, spending was, until
very recently, kept under tight restraint—in particular, capital expenditures were squeezed
further. The large revenue shortfalls imply, nevertheless, that the authorities’ balanced budget
objective for FY 2005/06 is out of reach. The shortfalls have, however, been financed
successfully, including through the very successful placement of several Eurobonds.

Monetary policy has been geared at containing inflation by targeting base money
while also seeking to engender a sustainable reduction in interest rates. The BOJ
aggressively cut interest rates through May 2005. Nevertheless, with strong capital inflows,
foreign reserves increased rapidly during the first half of the year. The reserve build-up was
fully sterilized by sales of central bank bills; indeed, base money contracted sharply in
nominal terms during the period. With inflation still accelerating, however, the BOJ
subsequently halted its rate cuts, but the Jamaican-U.S. interest rate differential has continued
to narrow, given the successive rounds of monetary tightening in the United States.

III. OUTLOOK FOR FY 2005/06 AND THE MEDIUM TERM
9.
The outlook is affected by the impact of recent developments on the
government’s medium-term plan to reduce the high debt through fiscal consolidation.
•

Economic policies in Jamaica have recently been guided by a medium-term
socio-economic policy framework adopted by the government in early 2004. The
authorities’ economic strategy under this framework, which continues to enjoy broad
popular and donor support, has been to seek to reduce public debt from over
140 percent of GDP in FY 2003/04 to around 100 percent by FY 2008/09. A
centerpiece of the strategy was the balanced budget objective for the current fiscal
year. As outlined in the government’s document, the achievement of this and other
medium-term macroeconomic targets was, however, predicated on several critical
factors: (i) absence of shocks to production; (ii) increase in confidence and an
accompanying sustained fall in interest rates; (iii) containment of the wage bill in
nominal terms; and (iv) maintenance of a high primary surplus.

- 11 -

•

The government’s economic strategy has, however, encountered several
unanticipated developments for which contingencies had not been spelled out a
priori. The external environment has been substantively less benign, and is likely to
remain so, than that projected earlier. Oil prices and global interest rates, in particular,
have been significantly higher than had been envisaged. On the domestic front,
supply shocks have lowered GDP and raised inflation relative to expectations and the
higher inflation has, in turn, put pressure on the wage bill.

10.
Against this difficult background, the imperative is to formulate a revised
medium-term path that seeks to continue to make adequate progress at debt reduction.
The staff’s baseline projections (Tables 1–6 and Figure 3 top panel), represent one such
scenario. Under this scenario, real GDP growth of 2½ percent is expected in FY 2005/06 on
the basis of current trends. This is well below the growth rate of 3¾ percent underpinning the
budget but still denotes a substantial recovery from the outturn of under ½ percent growth in
FY 2004/05. Growth is projected to pick up, to 2¾–3¼ percent per year, over the medium
term as ongoing projects, especially in hotels and the bauxite sector, come on stream. With
this output trajectory, and provided that the government can successfully limit the budget
deficit to about 1½ percent this year and about ½ percent in FY 2006/07, the debt ratio
should continue to decline, albeit to a still very high level, reaching 100 percent of GDP by
FY 2009/10, or a year later than originally envisaged.
11.
This revised debt trajectory remains, however, subject to the same risks as
before. First, shocks that lower growth by 2 percentage points per year relative to the
baseline will add 10 percentage points to the debt-to-GDP ratio by the end of the projection
period (Figure 3, second panel). A weaker fiscal effort (by 1½ percent of GDP per year) than
envisaged in the staff’s baseline will also increase the debt-to-GDP ratio by 6¼ percentage
points by the end of the projection period. Finally, while the baseline incorporates the impact
of some moderate increases in global and domestic interest rates, sustained high rate hikes
will render the 100 percent debt-to-GDP ratio objective out of reach even by FY 2009/10. In
particular, with gross annual financing needs estimated at 20–25 percent of GDP (over half
of GDP if central bank bills are also included), the debt dynamics remain highly sensitive to
macroeconomic volatility and market sentiments.
12.
The projections also underscore the benefits of taking early fiscal action were
further shocks to materialize. For example, the impact on the FY 2009/10 debt ratio of
higher interest rates (by 150 basis points) throughout the medium term could be offset by
fiscal measures amounting to 0.4 percent of GDP, if taken now (Figure 3, bottom panel).
Instead, waiting until the end of the projection period will require measures amounting to
1.8 percent of GDP. The results are similar for shocks affecting the primary balance. Going
forward, it is therefore important for the government to spell out in advance contingent
measures to be taken if faced with further shocks.

IV. REPORT ON POLICY DISCUSSIONS
13.
The discussions focused on the necessary policy adjustments in response to
recent developments, as well as the long-term challenges confronting the Jamaican
economy. On the fiscal front, the focus was on the appropriate pace and composition of
adjustment toward regaining the balanced budget objective. On monetary and exchange rate
policy, the short-run challenges posed by the changed global environment, as well as the
constraints implied by the high debt burden were discussed. The discussions also covered the
key issues of enhancing growth and further reducing vulnerabilities as part of the drive to
sustainability.
A. Fiscal Policy
14.
The authorities remain committed to achieving a balanced budget over the
medium term and to bringing about a steady decline in the debt ratio despite the
deviation from the fiscal targets in the short-run. They emphasized the strictly temporary
nature of the current deviations and underscored their resolve to achieve balanced budgets by
FY 2007/08. They further indicated that in the interim, they would try to minimize the deficit
to the extent feasible, likely in the range of 2–2½ percent of GDP for FY 2005/06 and about
1 percent of GDP the following year. These deficits were necessitated by both the weakerthan-envisaged revenues and the likely need for some additional appropriations for spending
in FY 2005/06, mostly on account of increases in allowances and pensions due to the
significantly higher-than-envisaged inflation. There were also severe expenditure pressures
stemming from the extensive flooding and road damage associated with the hurricanes,
though some of these expenses would have to be pushed out to FY 2006/07.
15.
The mission noted that the revenue shortfall appeared to reflect policy slippages
and declining tax compliance but agreed with the authorities that other factors were
also at play. Some revenue measures underpinning the FY 2005/06 budget were not
implemented as or when envisaged. Of equal concern were the indications of declining tax
compliance, as evidenced by the reduction in effective rates of taxation. In particular,
production and consumption taxes had failed to keep up with inflation despite an increase in
the statutory rate for the General Consumption Tax by 1.5 percentage points. The authorities
pointed out, and the mission agreed, that other factors were also at play behind the revenue
weakness. They noted that the fall in real disposable incomes of public sector employees,
whose wages had been frozen under the existing memorandum of understanding (MOU)
between the government and the public sector unions, had likely translated into an overall
decline in consumption and, therefore consumption-related taxes. Furthermore, with the
increase in tax rates, a switch in consumption to nontaxed items had likely occurred. In this
regard, the mission noted that the hike in rates may indeed have had a perverse effect on
yields by increasing incentives for avoidance and evasion, although any decline in
compliance would normally have been expected to be slower.
16.
While recognizing that the original fiscal targets no longer appeared feasible, the
mission urged the authorities to be more ambitious. The mission commended the
authorities for the remarkable expenditure restraint during the first two-thirds of the fiscal
year but expressed concerns regarding the weaker policy stance going forward. Taking the
strong seasonal pattern into account, the mission viewed a deficit of about 1½ percent of

- 14 -

GDP for FY 2005/06, declining to ½ percent of GDP during FY 2006/07, as reflecting a
more appropriate set of targets. It further advised that if the economy picked up more than
was currently envisaged, a mid-year budget revision be undertaken in FY 2006/07 to target a
zero deficit already that year. This, in the mission’s view, struck an adequate balance
between accommodating unanticipated shocks, on the one hand, and getting back on track to
balanced budgets as soon as possible, on the other.
17.
There was consensus that the fiscal outturn for FY 2005/06 remained uncertain.
While noting the already compressed nonwage expenditures and the limited additional
spending planned for this year, the mission suggested that a comprehensive review of the
entire expenditure envelope be undertaken to identify possible savings. As regards revenues,
the authorities explained that the arrears-collection program underpinning some of their
projections had begun (albeit with a substantial delay) but its efficacy remained to be
demonstrated. Going forward, revenues also depended crucially on the strength of the tourist
season and the economic recovery. The mission welcomed the start of the arrears clearance
program as well as of specific audits to improve compliance with current tax obligations and
recommended also reviewing assessment and return filing procedures. It suggested that
forceful implementation of all of these programs, coupled with greater use (in the context of
a highly visible campaign targeting the largest taxpayers) of enforcement powers, could
substantially improve revenue collection.
18.
Given the expected size of the shortfall relative to the FY 2005/06 targets, the
mission noted, however, the likely need for additional revenue measures in the context
of the FY 2006/07 budget. The mission emphasized that the measures hinged critically on
next year’s wage bill, given the impending expiration of the current MOU with public sector
unions and the uncertainty regarding the next agreement. Government plans in other areas
(both for FY 2006/07 and the medium-term) also remained to be fully fleshed out. Given the
limited room on expenditures, the mission suggested a significant effort to expand the tax net
to include more of the large informal sector through: (i) presumptive forms of taxation;
(ii) the introduction of a capital gains tax; and, (iii) an expansion of the special consumption
tax on motor vehicles and adjustments to other specific rates that have been eroded by
inflation. It also recommended the rationalization of the external tariff regime to both
simplify the structure and raise revenues. More generally, the mission suggested that the
government should continue with tax reforms, to be implemented in a comprehensive fashion
and aimed at removing exemptions and preferences, unifying rates, leveling the playing field,
and increasing transparency.
19.
The mission cautioned that the external funding available from the PetroCaribe
agreement should not loosen the fiscal effort. The authorities indicated that they were
considering using funds freed up by the agreement (under which Venezuela was offering
concessional loans for petroleum purchases) for spending by public enterprises. The mission
explained that at a general government level, new spending would represent a loosening of
the fiscal effort, leading to higher public debt (Table 3). It recommended that the
concessional financing be used instead to offset other, more expensive borrowing and that all
relevant related activities be reflected in the government accounts.

- 15 -

20.
Accelerating structural reforms will bolster the authorities’ medium-term fiscal
strategy. Discussions focused, in particular, on increasing the productivity of the public
sector and reforming public enterprises. On the former, the mission noted that the across-theboard wage and employment freeze under the existing MOU had, in addition to reducing real
incomes, also limited the room for the government to attract and retain qualified personnel.
Identifying and shedding excess employment could create room for savings that could be
used, at least in part, to rationalize the wage structure and better reward more productive
employees. The authorities concurred that public sector employment was an area in need of a
plan for the way forward. As regards public enterprises, the mission noted that a significant
increase in public debt in recent years had been due to the government taking on obligations
of commercial enterprises. Going forward, it will be important to continue to restructure and
reform such enterprises, including through closures as necessary so that they do not add to
the debt burden.
B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
21.
The recent shocks and changes in the global environment have been particularly
challenging for the conduct of monetary policy, given the fiscal dominance and growth
concerns in Jamaica. The authorities viewed the FY 2005/06 inflation target as feasible but
for the shocks. They explained that policy had primarily been geared at containing monetary
impulses to inflation. Cognizant of the fiscal and growth implications, the BOJ had, however,
also endeavored to engender a stable reduction in interest rates, to the extent that the pace of
such changes remained consistent with market expectations and could be sustained. The key
question was, therefore, the extent to which the interest rate hikes in the United States and the
fiscal and output developments in Jamaica impinged on policies going forward.
22.
The mission indicated a preference for preemptively and gradually increasing
interest rates to confront pressures in the capital account. It argued that in the absence of
a sufficiently proactive stance, large capital outflows could eventually require an abrupt,
large and sustained increase in interest rates.3 In the mission’s view, a gradual pre-emptive
tightening would likely need to be of less magnitude cumulatively, easier to unwind, and thus
more supportive of growth over the longer-run than reactive rate hikes. Finally, gradualism
would enable domestic financial entities, significantly exposed to liquidity and interest rate
risks, to make the necessary portfolio adjustments to reduce the negative impact of liquidity
crunches and erosion of the limited capital base.
23.
While the authorities supported the principle of proactive monetary policy, they
believed that the recent portfolio shifts were temporary and, therefore, a case for
tightening was yet to be made. The BOJ was of the view that accelerated portfolio shifts in
the fourth quarter of 2005 mainly reflected concerns about inflation and consequently, real
interest rates. This had occurred in a context of seasonally lower foreign exchange earnings,
exacerbated by the impact of hurricanes in the region. Both of these concerns were, however,

- 16 -

likely to dissipate over the short-run. Indeed, there had already been sharp declines in
monthly inflation and early data indicated an even stronger-than-anticipated tourist season.
24.
The authorities remain ready, however, to adjust rates if the conditions so
warrant. They acknowledged that the narrowing interest differential vis-à-vis the
United States posed a risk. This risk could, however, be managed in their view, by a
judicious mix of foreign exchange flexibility and market interventions. They noted that nearterm stability was more contingent on fiscal policy, the debt dynamics and the growth
prospects. They emphasized, however, that the BOJ had always maintained its policy
flexibility and would adjust rates if and when necessary.
25.
The mission reinforced the view that fiscal policy was the driving force behind
macroeconomic developments, including long-term inflation, in Jamaica. Inflation,
averaging 9½ percent annually since 1997 was high by international standards. Cross-country
analysis suggested that expectations regarding fiscal policy may be a factor in explaining the
persistence of high inflation (Box 1). The empirical link between inflation and debt
suggested, in particular, that: (i) monetary tightening is likely to have only a limited impact
on long-term inflation in Jamaica if not accompanied by debt reduction; and (ii) sustained
sterilized purchases of foreign exchange by the central bank may be ineffective in containing
inflation because the attendant debt accumulation would eventually weaken, or even offset,
the sterilization impact.4 The authorities, on their part, considered the base money
management framework to have been successful in reducing inflation since 1996 and
ascribed recent developments largely to exogenous factors. Notwithstanding the high costs of
sterilization, they also emphasized the benefits, in terms of higher credit ratings and better
borrowing terms, of maintaining sufficient external reserves, which currently stood at about
US$2 billion or over four months of imports.
26.
Over the longer term, exchange rate flexibility will continue to be required. The
mission recommended that any pressures for capital outflows be contained mainly through
interest rate policy, particularly in view of the sensitivity of the debt dynamics to sharp
swings in the exchange rate. At the same time, it was also important for longer-term
movements of the exchange rate to reflect fundamental developments in the real sector. The
mission noted that the external competitiveness of the economy, as measured by the real
effective exchange rate, has eroded recently due to high inflation relative to trading partners
(Box 2). In this regard, while the current level of the exchange rate does not appear to be out
of line with its historical levels, longer-term movements in the nominal rate should
accommodate inflation differentials vis-à-vis trading partners.

The sterilization is undertaken with short-term central bank bills, the outstanding stock of
which currently stands at around 25 percent of GDP and has an average (and recently
declining) maturity of four months.

Box 1. Influence of Public Debt on Inflation
Inflation is affected not only by current and past money supply but also expectations about
future fiscal policy, which affects future income or perceptions of current wealth. One such
channel is the public’s expectation of future monetization of public debt. Changes in such
expectations affect current money demand and hence the current price level.1 Another
channel is the wealth effect of holding government debt—aggregate demand would increase
and thereby affect the price level if the public considers its holdings of government debt as
real wealth.2
An empirical analysis of 71 country experiences for up to 43 years conducted by staff (see
accompanying Selected Issues paper) indicate that:
•

Increases in public debt are strongly and significantly associated with higher inflation
in developing countries, after controlling for changes in money supply, exchange rates,
and output as well as output gap. This debt-inflation relationship is weak in inflexible
exchange rate regimes and does not hold in major advanced economies.

•

Public debt growth is more inflationary in high debt countries than in low debt
countries. On average, a 10 percentage point higher debt-to-GDP ratio is associated
with a 1 percentage point higher elasticity of inflation to debt growth.

Box 2. Jamaica’s Competitiveness over Time
Movements in real effective exchange rate (REER) measures have been driven by the persistent gap
between Jamaica’s inflation and that of its trading partners, which in turn is partly influenced by the
historically high exchange rate pass-through to inflation. Competitiveness, as measured by the CPIbased REER (left panel), received a boost in 2002/03, when the nominal exchange rate depreciated
strongly. Relative unit labor costs mirrored the developments in relative inflation, with increases in
labor costs in Jamaica outstripping those of its advanced trading partners through the late 1990s but
moderating in 2003.
Based on these and other indicators (Figure 4), the picture on the current level of the external
competitiveness appears to be largely mixed although the lack of timely data makes the assessment
tentative. The CPI-based REER strengthened with the recent upsurge in inflation in late 2005, rising
significantly above its long-term average (although still remaining somewhat below its peak in mid1998). Unit labor cost data are not available for recent months but are likely to have moved along
with inflation.

C. Enhancing Growth and Further Reducing Vulnerabilities
27.
The persistence of low growth in Jamaica has been disappointing and somewhat
puzzling. The economy was extensively liberalized in the early 1990s. It has an educated
English-speaking labor force that is situated close to the United States. It also ranks relatively
high on several measures of the investment climate. Finally, it remains relatively successful
in attracting foreign direct investment and has high overall investment rates (see Figure 4),
suggesting that the crowding-out of private investment by debt was not key to explaining the
Jamaican experience.

The staff surmised that the high debt is likely to have contributed to the low
growth through its impact on the productivity and efficiency, rather than the
magnitude, of investment. Cross-country data show a negative relationship between total
factor productivity and total public debt.5 Staff suggested that by skewing private
investments toward safer but lower-return and shorter-term activities and industries, it was
possible that the uncertainties created by high debt were (despite the high rates of overall
investment) contributing to lower productivity and, therefore, low growth. Also, given the
complementarity between public and private investment, countries with very low levels of
public investment, as in Jamaica, appeared to grow more slowly, even if private investment
remained high.

The authorities noted that growth was likely higher due to the large and
informal economy but that further analysis was needed. Notwithstanding the large
informal sector, the authorities’ main concerns were how to accelerate and sustain growth at
levels that would generate employment and an appreciable rise in per capita income in an
environment of eroding trade preferences and frequent natural disasters.6 This required
raising labor productivity and reducing vulnerability to weather-related shocks.
30.
Staff agreed that growth should continue to be a key focus of future
consultations and pointed to a number of growth-enhancing public policy priorities.
Structural reforms to increase productivity were especially important, given the negative
impact on competitiveness of the recent real exchange rate appreciation. Staff encouraged
actions along a number of fronts. First, the tax reform agenda remained key—exemptions

tended to promote sectors already growing fast at the cost of reducing public resources that
could be devoted elsewhere. The numerous taxes and complex reporting requirements also
increased the costs of doing business and labor costs could be reduced to the extent that there
was scope for shifting taxes towards capital income. Second, access to credit could be
improved for smaller enterprises adversely affected by the absence of credit registries and
weak collateral procedures. Third, reducing crime, whose direct costs amounted to 5 percent
of GDP by some estimates, should remain a priority.
31.
Furthermore, there may be scope to increase the quality of education and reorient it to the needs of Jamaica. Jamaica has one of the highest emigration rates in the
world, with more than 80 percent of the skilled labor force estimated to have left the country
over the last 35 years.7 The critical policy question is whether the returns (in terms of
remittances and investment by the diaspora) adequately compensate for the public investment
costs of educating migrants. Related is the question of whether public education should be
reoriented more towards meeting the needs of the domestic economy. Staff noted the findings
of the Public Expenditure Review carried out with World Bank assistance that education
outcomes and returns were not commensurate with government spending and encouraged the
authorities to explore policy options to ensure that government social investment benefited
Jamaica first and foremost.
32.
The discussions on risk mitigation centered on the financial sector. Jamaica’s
financial system is large and interconnected and is the main source of budgetary financing.
The system’s overall assets amounted to an estimated 185 percent of GDP at end-2004,
deeper than in countries with comparable income levels. Institutions of an advanced financial
system—banks and securities, insurance, pension, and asset management companies—are all
present with sizeable balance sheets. These institutions are closely interconnected through a
small number of mostly foreign-owned financial conglomerates. A distinguishing
development over the past few years has been the growth of securities dealers, whose main
line of business has been to repo long-duration government debt to the general public in
return for short-term funds, thereby exposing themselves to significant interest rate and
liquidity risks. Measured in terms of asset size, securities dealers now exceed commercial
banks.
33.
Following on recent strides to bring financial sector supervision and regulation
in line with international best practice, the authorities remain committed to further
strengthening the financial sector. In recent years, salient steps taken to strengthen the
sector have included the establishment of an independent regulatory body (the Financial
Services Commission) to oversee nonbanking financial entities and a high-level inter-agency
coordination body (the Financial Regulatory Council). The authorities have also improved
the reporting and regulatory framework, inter alia, by increasing capital requirements for
banks and introducing capital and margin requirements for securities dealers. The FSAP has
identified further areas for strengthening (Box 3). The mission emphasized the need to

Box 3. Key FSAP Recommendations
Although the financial system currently appears well-capitalized and supervision has been
considerably strengthened in recent years, financial institutions operate in a risky
macroeconomic environment with regulatory gaps. Reducing the large public debt is
essential to provide a broad underpinning for financial stability as the financial system (and
securities dealers in particular) appears most exposed to interest rate and liquidity risks,
magnified by conglomerate structures as a possible channel of contagion. While much
progress has been made in strengthening the supervisory and regulatory framework, the
FSAP recommended a number of measures to further buttress the financial system.
¾ Enhance crisis management capacity, including through more coordinated
financial stability analysis and planning across regulatory agencies as well as
testing crisis management systems in coordinated simulation exercises.
¾ Strengthen consolidated supervision, including of conglomerates.
¾ Enhance measures underway to strengthen prudential requirements for security
dealers by raising margin requirements for repurchase operations (repos) in GOJ
securities to at least 10 percent this year, and strictly enforcing compliance with
regulations.
¾ Clarify the legal framework for repos and other collateralized debt and introduce a
centralized securities depository for fixed-income securities.
¾ Undertake a careful analysis of the risk concentration of insurers and the
adequacy of their reinsurance coverage against low probability but catastrophic
natural events.
¾ Expedite the adoption of an appropriate legal framework for payment and
settlement systems and introduce a real time gross settlement system.

remain vigilant in forestalling any vulnerabilities in the financial system by taking the
necessary steps.
34.
The authorities were pleased by the FSAP’s favorable assessment of the steps
that they have taken so far and noted their intention to follow up on the
recommendations. They pointed out that deposit-taking institutions remained generally
sound, as indicated by their liquidity and capital adequacy ratios. More importantly, stress
tests had revealed that the banking system was robust to sizeable interest rate, exchange rate,
liquidity and credit shocks. They were also executing plans to further strengthen the
prudential regime for securities dealers. On conglomerates, the authorities stressed that they
had made great strides toward implementing consolidated supervision and noted that
remaining regulatory gaps on the banking side would be addressed in the planned Omnibus
bill. The BOJ also felt that broader changes in the supervisory architecture might be needed

- 23 -

and looked to the FSAP for a more definitive prescription. Staff pointed out that the FSAP’s
focus had been mainly on helping make the existing supervisory and regulatory system more
effective and address the most pressing vulnerabilities. The mission noted the need to
strengthen reporting requirements and undertake stress tests for nonbank financial entities.
There was also scope to improve the flow of information further between the various
regulatory authorities and continue to educate the public about the relative risk-reward mix of
different financial instruments.
35.
A prudent public debt management strategy can also help mitigate some of the
risks of financial market volatility. Jamaica’s debt consists of a wide variety of instruments
held by a diversified investor base. A staff study suggests that in an ideal world, and based
purely on the nature of past shocks, it would be optimal to weight heavily the issuance of
fixed interest rate domestic currency (short-term and long-term) and long-term U.S. dollardenominated instruments (see attached Selected Issues paper). In actuality, the market’s
appetite for different kinds of risks, and the market’s expectations of the impact of shocks are
not independent of the mix and magnitude of Jamaica’s debt issuances. Cognizant of all of
these considerations, the authorities have increased the proportion of fixed rate debt for the
domestic portfolio in recent years. Staff noted the appetite in international markets for localcurrency denominated debt and encouraged the authorities to explore further ways to
diversify the investor base as well as to issue amortizing (rather than bullet) external bonds.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
36.
Jamaica’s ambitious medium-term program has been weathering a difficult
period, starting with Hurricane Ivan in late 2004. Shocks that were not factored into the
plan have exacted a price. The economy has had to withstand a series of natural disasters, as
well as very large hikes in petroleum prices and increases in global interest rates. The fact
that budgetary targets have not been met and that inflation has been somewhat higher than
envisaged needs to be viewed against this background. At the same time, these developments
underscore the fact that Jamaica can ill afford any faltering of its revenue collection efforts,
or delays in undertaking policy corrections in response to changes in the global environment.
It is also important that the financial sector continues to be strengthened and risks mitigated.
The room for policy maneuverability is limited.
37.
Jamaica’s efforts to reduce debt of such high magnitudes through fiscal
consolidation alone is unprecedented—eliminating budgetary deficits as soon as
possible remains crucial to realizing the authorities’ objectives. The authorities are fully
committed to honoring existing obligations while seeking to reduce debt steadily along an
ambitious trajectory. This requires sustaining fiscal primary surpluses at levels, and for
periods, that have not been replicated elsewhere. Avoiding recurring fiscal slippages is thus
critical to the effort, especially given the past links between the electoral cycle and the fiscal
stance. Staff is encouraged that under difficult circumstances, the authorities remain
committed to limiting the size of the temporary fiscal deficits and eliminating such deficits
over the medium term. The authorities could attempt to be even more ambitious. In
particular, they are encouraged to target a balanced budget for FY 2006/07 if the economy
improves more than is currently envisaged.

- 24 -

38.
Realizing the budgetary objective for FY 2006/07 and beyond will require both
revenue measures and expenditure discipline. The staff considers it appropriate to place
current focus on administrative efforts to strengthen revenues, given that recent increases in
tax rates have not been fully successful and compliance remains a concern. The authorities
are encouraged to pursue tax delinquents in a visible and exemplary fashion. The approach of
relying on administrative efforts runs the risk, however, of rendering the final fiscal outcome
for FY 2005/06 somewhat uncertain. As regards FY 2006/07, the outlook depends, in
significant part, on the extent to which current efforts at improving revenues are successful as
well as, critically, on the outcome of negotiations for the wage bill. In all cases, further
measures will, however, likely be required. In this respect, the authorities are encouraged to
broaden the tax base rather than to increase rates on regressive taxes further. They should
also limit the debt burden emanating from off-budget entities. This requires continuing to
pursue public enterprise reforms and using new concessional debt to replace costlier
financing instead of expanding the overall expenditure envelope.
39.
Monetary and exchange rate policies will require deft handling in the period
ahead. Notwithstanding the severe fiscal dominance, there is some room for the monetary
stance to be more independent of short-term fiscal considerations. A proactive position to
forestall pressures from emerging, or of exacerbating, should in the long run prove more
supportive of fiscal and growth objectives than an accommodative and reactive monetary
policy. In this regard, the staff welcomes the authorities’ clarifications that they stand ready
to increase interest rates, if and when the conditions so warrant. As regards exchange rate
policy, the authorities will need to ensure that competitiveness is maintained over the long
run in the context of a flexible regime and that benefits of any sterilized foreign exchange
purchases are commensurate with the costs in terms of the increased debt burden.
40.
Ensuring robust economic growth is crucial to the authorities’ macroeconomic
strategy. The medium-term debt-to-GDP ratio is more sensitive to historical variations in
growth projections than it is to moderate changes in interest rates. And, as the past has
shown, Jamaica is exposed to both adverse natural events and changes in financial market
sentiments. Given the very limited room in the debt reduction strategy to accommodate these
growth variations and risks, policies to foster growth and further reduce vulnerabilities will
have to continue to receive high priority. The ongoing high levels of investment in the
economy are encouraging and indicate high growth potential, but policies will need to remain
strong for these investments to translate into greater productivity and efficiency. The
authorities are advised to continue with tax reform, improve access to credit, reduce crime,
and further strengthen institutional capacity to withstand adverse changes in global
conditions and sentiments.
41.
The authorities are encouraged to continue to strengthen the resilience of the
financial system and upgrade their statistical systems. The FSAP has identified a number
of areas to follow on the progress that has been made to-date. The authorities are advised, in
particular, to further develop crisis management capacity, improve consolidated supervision,
and enhance measures to strengthen prudential requirements for securities dealers. In this last
regard, the staff also encourages the authorities to continue to clarify the legal framework for
repos as well as the distinctions to the public of different types of institutions and the relative
risk-reward mix of diverse financial instruments. As regards broader data dissemination and

- 25 -

standards, Jamaica’s statistics are broadly adequate for surveillance. Consistent with the
government’s desire to maintain access to international capital markets, the staff encourages
the authorities, nevertheless, to continue upgrading their statistical systems toward eventual
subscription to the SDDS. The authorities could also usefully start regularly producing
financial surveys including securities dealers.
42.
The next two to three years will be critical for the authorities to meet their
opportunities to secure rising and sustainable living standards for Jamaica. Given the
interlinkages between high debt, low growth and high inflation, resolute implementation of
ambitious fiscal policies should, barring unexpected developments, eventually lead to a
virtuous cycle of improving living standards, low inflation and reduced debt. Repeated or
sustained deviations from the narrowly feasible path risk, on the other hand, an unraveling of
the strategy, especially given the large gross financing needs. Thus, the room for
maneuverability remains limited all around. It is encouraging in this regard that the
commitments to policies remain so strong.
43.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12month cycle.

Debt-stabilizing
primary
balance 9/
2.8

1/ Central government and government guaranteed debt on gross basis. From FY 2002/03, includes debt issued to the BoJ to cover its cash losses and related capitalized interest. The primary balance includes budgetary
primary balance and off-budget expenditure.
2/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + αε(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; α = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and
ε = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as αε(1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

Sources: Country authorities; Fund staff estimates and projections.

1/ Shaded areas and the Baseline projection line represent actual Central Government Debt data (i.e. NFPS Debt
excluding Government Guaranteed debt). Individual shocks are permanent one-half standard deviation shocks.
Figures in the boxes represent average projections for the respective variables in the baseline and scenario being
presented . Ten-year historical average for the variable is also shown.
2/ Permanent 1/4 standard deviation shocks applied to real interest rate, growth rate, and primary balance.
3/ One-time real depreciation of 30 percent and 10 percent of GDP shock to contingent liabilities occur in 2006,
with real depreciation defined as nominal depreciation (measured by percentage fall in dollar value of local
currency) minus domestic inflation (based on GDP deflator).

1/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; ρ = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms, g = real GDP growth rate,
ε = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and α = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock. ρ increases with an appreciating domestic currency (ε > 0) and rising inflation (based
on GDP Deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels of the last

Exchange Rate Arrangements:

The external value of the Jamaican dollar has been determined in an interbank market
operated by commercial banks beginning September 17, 1990. The Jamaican dollar has
depreciated significantly since then, though not in a uniform trend. At January 31, it was
trading at around J$65 to the U.S. dollar. At the conclusion of the 2004 Article IV
consultation for Jamaica, it was found that a multiple currency practice arose from the
implementation of the surrender requirement where authorized foreign exchange dealers and
cambios are required to surrender at least 5 percent–but not more than 10 percent–of their
purchases of U.S. dollars, Canadian dollars and pound sterling to the Bank of Jamaica (BOJ).
This surrender requirement is effected based on the previous day’s average selling rate for
the U.S. dollar, the Canadian dollar and the pound sterling, respectively, against the Jamaican
dollar (referred below as “surrender rates”). In 2004, the surrender rates had resulted in the
cross rates between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar and between the U.S. dollar and
the pound sterling to differ periodically (for more than 5 days) by more than 1 percent from
the midpoint spot exchange rates for those two currency pairs in their principal markets.
While such differences were observed in 2004 leading to a finding that a multiple currency
practice arose, the previously identified broken cross rate arising from the currency surrender
requirement is no longer apparent since this time. Therefore, there is no evidence that a
multiple currency practice arises from the surrender requirement.
IX.

Last Article IV Consultation and Program Relations:

Jamaica is on the standard 12-month consultation cycle, and the last Article IV consultation
was completed by the Executive Board on August 2, 2004 (IMF Country Report No. 04/263).
Interim staff reports were prepared for information of the Executive Board in-between
Article IV consultations (IMF Country Report Nos. 05/61 and 05/219). In addition, a
Financial Sector Assessment Program has been completed and awaits review by the
Executive Board.

Jamaica—Relations with the World Bank Group
(As of February 15, 2006)
The new Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Jamaica was discussed by the WB Board of
Executive Directors on May 10, 2005. The document proposes financial assistance of up to
US$150 million between 2006 and 2009, as well as technical and advisory services. The
CAS will support the Government’s own Medium–Term Socioeconomic Policy Framework
for 2004–2009 with lending, analytical, and technical assistance to accelerate inclusive
economic growth, improve human development and opportunity, and help prevent and
reduce crime. It was prepared in collaboration with the government and was widely consulted
and discussed with other donors, representatives of the private sector, CBOs, Chambers of
Commerce, trade unions, and academic institutions. As part of the assistance program, the
Bank will undertake analytical work including a Poverty Assessment, a Financial Sector
Assessment Program (jointly with the International Monetary Fund), a Country Fiduciary
Assessment (jointly with the Inter-American Development Bank), and a Diagnostic of the
Investment Climate. The Bank Group assistance program will include support from the
International Finance Corporation (IFC), focused on investment in infrastructure, the
financial sector, services and other sectors, and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee
Facility (MIGA), focused on development of the financial sector and key infrastructure.
A. Projects
The Jamaica REFORM OF SECONDARY EDUCATION PROJECT II was approved in
March 2003 for US$39.8 million. In support of Jamaica's 15 program to reform secondary
education, the Project will improve the quality, and equity of secondary education, and
expand access to upper secondary education, as well as strengthen the capacity of the central
ministry, and regional offices to manage, and monitor the reform. The components of the
Second Reform of Secondary Education Project will: 1) finance grants to selected secondary
schools, on the basis of annual work programs, and budgets for activities designed to
improve student outcomes, as well as direct costs associated with preparing, and
implementing school improvement plans. Technical assistance will support the preparation of
a school improvement plan manual, and training materials, while training assistance in school
development, and management will be provided; 2) finance centrally coordinated activities
that complement the bottom up approach, and support all-age schools not eligible for school
improvement grants (SIGs), to rally national literacy programs, and mathematics, by
providing tools for teachers to diagnose the specific learning problems, enriching libraries
and media centers, and supporting counseling for at-risk youths; 3) provide access to upper
secondary school, by securing excess capacity in independent secondary schools, through
construction of new schools, and extension of existing selected schools; and, 4) support the
Ministry of Education, and regional offices in the implementation of the above components,
as their role shifts from centralized, to one responsive to school-based demands for technical
assistance, and continuous support on monitoring outcomes.
The Jamaica HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Project was approved in August 2002 for
US$15 million. The HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Project for Jamaica is part of the

- 42 -

APPENDIX II

Second Phase Multi-Country HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Adaptable Program Lending
(APL) for the Caribbean Region, which provides loans and/or credits to governments in the
Region to finance their HIV/AIDS programs. Jamaica has met the five eligibility criteria for
country participation. This project aims to support selected activities of Jamaica's HIV/AIDS
National Strategic Plan (NSP). Using a multi-sectoral approach, it assists the Government of
Jamaica in curbing the spread of the HIV epidemic through 1) the expansion of preventive
programs targeted to high-risk groups as well as the general population; 2) the strengthening
of treatment, care, and support for persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA); and 3) the
strengthening of Jamaica's multisectoral capacity to respond to the epidemic
The Jamaica Social Safety Net Project was approved in February 2002 for US$40 million.
The Social Safety Net Project is supporting the Government's efforts to transform the social
safety net into a fiscally sound, and efficient system of social assistance for the poor, and
vulnerable groups. The components will: 1) finance conditional grants for poor children (up
to age 17), eligible under the program. Direct costs regarding schooling, and health care
delivery will be financed by those grants, conditioned on regular health clinic visits for
children up to the age of six not enrolled in school, and for children on school attendance up
to the age of seventeen; 2) finance conditional grants to poor pregnant/lactating mothers,
elderly poor over the age of sixty-five, and poor disabled, and destitute adults under the age
of sixty-five, eligible under the program. Benefits will be conditional on regular health clinic
visits for adult beneficiaries; and, 3) strengthen the institutional capacity of the Ministry of
Labor and Social Security, and institutions involved in the operation, and streamlining of the
social safety net in Jamaica. Support will be provided for enrollment mechanisms of
temporary employees, hired for data processing, including as well the financing of the
necessary technology information equipment, and software. Technical assistance, will
support implementation of the scoring formula, based on data from the Survey of Living
Conditions, namely at the early stages, when the scoring formula will require periodic
review, and refinement. Also included are training, and promotion assistance, project
management costs, and, monitoring, and evaluation systems.
The Jamaica National Community Development Project was approved in April 2003 for
US$15 million. The National Community Development Project aims at providing basic
services and creating temporary employment opportunities for the poorest groups in Jamaica.
To this end, several subprojects have been identified as priority by these communities for
funding by the Jamaica Social Investment Fund (JSIF). The project components include:
1) financing of demand-driven, and community-implemented socioeconomic infrastructure
works, and activities, through subprojects that include construction, and rehabilitation of
basic infrastructure, and social super-structure facilities. Community assessments will be
implemented, to ensure appropriate skills (or ability to acquire skills), and resources
availability to manage the proposed community-contracted works; 2) financing for technical
assistance, training, and strengthening programs to JSIF, and the various entities to be
involved in the project, particularly to support the Community Based Contracting (CBC)
system. Financing will also be provided for additional consultants to support implementation
of community contracting; and, 3) funding for goods required to facilitate subproject
supervision, monitoring, and community training.

APPENDIX II

The Jamaica IDF Grant for Strengthening Debt Management Capacity was approved in
October 2003 for US$274,000. The purpose of the grant is to strengthen the capacity of the
Ministry of Finance and Planning to develop its debt management strategy.
B. Economic and Sector Work
During 2003 and 2004, the Bank prepared a Country Economic Memorandum focused on
issues related to accelerating inclusive economic growth and, during 2004 and 2005, a Public
Expenditure Review examining public expenditure allocation priorities and public sector
reform issues in Jamaica’s tight fiscal environment. In addition, a study on growth and
competitiveness issues in the Caribbean recently completed by the Bank provides the
Government with insights and policy recommendations for improving the competitiveness of
the economy. The dissemination of these reports represented a key instrument for policy
discussion with the Government on the country’s development priorities and the Bank’s
assistance strategy.
A Poverty Assessment currently under preparation will provide an updated assessment of
poverty levels and will focus on poverty and the labor market, and the link between crime
and violence and poverty. Work on a Country Fiduciary Assessment (CFA), in collaboration
with the Inter-American Development Bank, is underway to help strengthen public financial
management and procurement. It will also help to provide a sound basis for the
harmonization and alignment with the country’s procurement and financial management
systems. To help create a positive enabling environment for private sector driven growth, the
Bank is also undertaking a Diagnostic of Investment Climate which will provide policy
recommendations complementary to the recently completed study on growth and
competitiveness issues in the Caribbean.
The Bank will continue the informal monitoring of macroeconomic developments given the
vulnerability of the economy. This will be done within the context of the results based
monitoring framework agreed between the Government and the donors. In addition, the Bank
will undertake just-in-time policy notes to follow-up on specific findings and
recommendations of the studies undertaken during the CAS period and other issues jointly
identified with the authorities.
In addition to the country specific analytical work, Jamaica will benefit from ongoing and
planned regional studies. A Caribbean regional study on Crime, Violence and Social
Exclusion would focus on the impact of crime on tourism, investment, poverty, and social
cohesion. This would be a multi-sectoral endeavor aimed at developing recommendations
that would draw on experience from successful interventions in Brazil and elsewhere. The
Bank has completed a Social Protection Strategy Review paper for the Caribbean, including a
focus on Jamaica. The objective of the strategy is to strengthen the Bank’s ability to support
clients on social protection through: (i) better understanding the key socio-economic risks,
existing country-level social protection programs, coverage and implementation gaps, and
outstanding country-level needs; (ii) stronger coordination with country counterparts and
donors; and (iii) more strategic emphasis on the Bank's comparative advantage in the region.
A Caribbean regional study on Migration, Remittances and the Diaspora will examine the
impact of migration and its implications for public policy decisions surrounding the financing
of higher education and skills development; the impact, facilitation, and potential leverage of

APPENDIX II

- 44 -

remittance flows; and the potential for the growth of niche markets among the diaspora. This
work will be undertaken in close collaboration with other donors, most notably the IDB.
Additional planned regional studies cover issues related to pension reform, health financing,
and the infrastructure and financial sectors

JAMAICA—RELATIONS WITH THE INTER-AMERICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
Jamaica joined the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) in 1969. Since then, the
IDB has approved 91 loans (76 projects) to Jamaica amounting to US$1.4 billion and 160
technical cooperation operations totaling US$52.2 million. IDB financial assistance has
supported a wide range of infrastructural, environmental and social sector projects with a
view to enhancing Jamaica’s human resource and absorptive capacity and strengthening the
foundation for private sector-led growth. In addition, the IDB has supported reforms aimed at
strengthening the institutional and regulatory environment.
The IDB is the leading lender to Jamaica among multilateral development partners. As of
March 2004, Jamaica’s outstanding debt to the IDB stood at US$704 million representing
16 percent of Jamaica’s total external debt and 61 percent of Jamaica’s multilateral debt. Out
of this outstanding debt, US$687 million were public sector loans and US$17 million were
private sector loans. With respect to the loan terms, 46 percent is on Ordinary Capital (OC)
terms, 43 percent on Intermediate Financing Facility (IFF) terms and 8 percent on Fund for
Special Operations (FSO) terms (see Table 1). Table 1 provides a breakdown of the
outstanding portfolio by type of lending program showing the applicable weighted average
interest rates which vary between 2 percent and 7 percent. The IFF provides an interest
subsidy on OC lending of up to 5 percentage points of the OC interest rate, provided that the
effective rate does not go below 3.38 percent. With 43 percent of the outstanding debt
receiving IFF terms, this program provides substantial saving to Jamaica. Jamaica’s
eligibility to receive IFF terms is under review at the present time.

At the present time, there are 14 loan projects and 22 technical cooperation projects in
execution with total IDB contributions of US$350 million and US$10 million, respectively,
(see Table 2). Thirty-five percent of the IDB project funds and 27 percent of the TC funds
have been disbursed leaving some US$235 million available for disbursement. In addition,
there are US$280 million in the pipeline, divided between 17 loan projects and 7 TCs.
Despite the availability of these funds for disbursement to Jamaica, it is anticipated that the
actual disbursement in 2004 will be small as a result of the fiscal and debt constraints that the
Government of Jamaica faces. For the same reason, there is likely to be a concentration on
TC assistance in order to maintain some level of development assistance to Jamaica. In this

APPENDIX III

- 46 -

regard, attention may be drawn to a recently approved TC which provides assistance to
Jamaica in the conduct of a major review of the tax system with a due to identifying reforms
for promoting improved resource allocation and growth.

Table 3 below shows the disbursement and repayment flows to Jamaica from 1997 to 2004. It
can be observed that the net cash flow to Jamaica has been overwhelmingly negative during
that period. This situation is expected to persist into the foreseeable future, given existing
limitations on further borrowing from the IDB, as a result of the country’s high debt ratio and
fiscal constraints. Table 4 provides five-year projections of loan collections from Jamaica on
IDB loans on the basis of the existing portfolio. These projections take into account both OC
and FSO debt outstanding.

JAMAICA—STATISTICAL ISSUES
In early 2003, Jamaica started participating in the Fund’s General Data Dissemination
System (GDDS), which provides participants with a framework for the development of the
statistical system. The statistical base is adequate for surveillance despite weaknesses,
however data is not sent separately to the GDDS.

Bank of Jamaica:
Ministry of Finance and Planning:
Planning Institute of Jamaica:
Statistical Institute of Jamaica:

http://www.boj.org.jm/
http://www.mof.gov.jm/
http://www.pioj.gov.jm/
http://www.statinja.com/

National accounts
There are weaknesses in the national accounts and other real sector data. In regard to
estimates of GDP, concerns relate both to its level and growth rate. Addressing these
shortcomings has been hindered, inter alia, by insufficient legal authority granted to the
Statistical Institute of Jamaica (STATIN) to collect source data, as well as by institutional
weaknesses, including a lack of resources. However, efforts are being made to effect some
improvements to national accounts data, including updating the base year. Assistance on
national accounts methodology was provided by Statistics Canada, and by a STA technical
assistance mission in June 2001. The first publication of quarterly national accounts was
issued in August 2002.
Prices
The index weights are derived from the Household Expenditure Survey conducted in
1984.The outdated weights of the published consumer price index (CPI) are derived from a
household expenditure survey carried out in 1984. However, the base for the index is January
1988 and results in an apparent mismatch with the reference period of the weights.
Production
No data on industrial production indices, on wholesale or producer prices, on import
volumes, or on export or import prices have been reported for publication in the International
Financial Statistics (IFS) in recent years.
Government Finance Statistics (GFS)
These data are available at:
Debt: http://www.mof.gov.jm/dmu/
Budget: http://www.mof.gov.jm/programmes/em/fpmu/default.shtml
Data are not currently reported separately for publication in IFS. In 2005, the authorities
reported data for 2003, in GFSM 2001 format, for publication in the 2005 GFS Yearbook.

- 48 -

APPENDIX IV

Monetary accounts
The published statistics for the Bank of Jamaica (BOJ) are sectorized, classified, and valued
in accordance with international standards, and are published in a timely manner. The
classification and structure of public entities need to be updated regularly in order to avoid
the mixing of central government’s accounts with the financial positions of public
enterprises and to exclude those entities that are no longer in the public sector from the
monetary accounts of the BOJ and commercial banks. Currently, information on deposit
money banks and monetary authorities is being reported on a regular basis. A forthcoming
mission from STA will assist the authorities to develop the standardized report forms of the
monetary statistics.
Balance of payments
The BOJ compiles and disseminates balance of payments data on a monthly and annual
basis. Detailed annual balance of payments data are reported by the BOJ for publication in
the Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook (BOPSY) and the IFS. At present, the BOJ does
not compile International Investment Position (IIP) statistics although it has begun
preparatory work with assistance from the Caribbean Regional Technical Assistance Center
(CARTAC) and the European Union.

This supplement provides an update on recent developments. The thrust of the
appraisal contained in the staff report is not qualitatively affected by these developments.
2.
Macroeconomic trends described in the staff report have continued. Headline
inflation was 12.4 percent (year-on-year) in February 2006, compared to 13 percent at end2005—the same level projected for the end of the current fiscal year (FY 2005/06). Recent
data confirm that an agricultural recovery is underway and tourist arrivals have been strong,
as foreshadowed earlier. The projection in the staff report of real GDP growth of 2½ percent
for FY 2005/06, therefore, remains appropriate.
3.
The exchange rate is continuing to come under intermittent pressure. The Bank
of Jamaica (BOJ) has maintained its key policy interest rate at 13 percent, unchanged since
May 2005 despite the successive rounds of monetary tightening in the United States. This
narrowing interest rate differential has continued to exert pressures on the external capital
account. Following a brief period of stability in early 2006, the nominal exchange rate has
resumed depreciating, losing about 1 percent of its value over the past six weeks. Central
bank reserves fell by US$69 million in February, but remain comfortable at over
US$2 billion, or four months of imports.
Revenues improved moderately in January, while revised budget estimates recently
approved by parliament envisage some increase in spending during the remainder of the
fiscal year. The authorities collected 88 percent of their originally targeted revenues for
January, up from an average of 82½ percent during the fourth quarter of 2005. Monthly
expenditures remained broadly in line with budgeted amounts. However, revised budget
estimates recently approved by parliament envisage an increase in wages and salaries and
other non-interest recurrent expenditures for the year as a whole by J$5.1 billion (0.8 percent
of GDP), broadly in line with the projections in the staff report. The effect on the overall
balance of the increased expenditures has been partially offset by lower-than-envisaged
domestic interest payments. Nevertheless, with the persistent weaknesses in revenue
performance, the overall deficit for FY 2005/06 is likely to be somewhat higher, and the
primary surplus lower by 0.8 percent of GDP, than had been envisaged in the staff report.

Although uncertainties about the final fiscal outcome for FY 2005/06 remain on account of
the pattern of strong seasonal revenue pick-up at the end of the fiscal year, recent
developments underscore the staff’s call for greater ambition in setting the FY 2006/07
budget targets.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2005 Article IV Consultation
with Jamaica
On March 24, 2006, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Jamaica.1
Background
Economic activity has been adversely affected by shocks. Real GDP contracted sharply
in late 2004 following the devastating effects of Hurricane Ivan. Thereafter, while output
recovered, it was dampened by the poor performance of agriculture, which suffered from
adverse weather conditions, including a number of major hurricanes during July–
October 2005. The hurricanes also caused infrastructure damage and led to a sharp
temporary drop in tourist arrivals. Recent data indicate, however, that the agricultural
recovery is firmly underway and tourist arrivals have picked up strongly.
Inflation remains high and volatile. Consumer prices registered a marked increase in the
aftermath of Hurricane Ivan, reaching 13¼ percent at end-2004. Thereafter, annual
headline inflation continued to pick up, reaching a high of 19 percent in September
2005, before falling back to 12.4 percent in February. Agriculture, which weighs heavily
in the consumer price basket, was responsible for most of the surge in prices.
The upward spiral in energy prices also played a part since changes in international oil
prices are fully reflected at the retail pump in Jamaica.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions
with members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and
financial information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments
and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the
basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the
Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive
Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities.

-2-

The external current account balance weakened on account of the shocks, with some
reversal in capital flows occurring during the second half of 2005. Export performance
weakened because of crop damage while imports shot up mainly due to higher oil
prices. As regards the capital account, the government successfully tapped global
financial markets to finance the budget at relatively favorable spreads and private
inflows also strengthened in early 2005. As a result, net international reserves (NIR)
increased rapidly through June 2005, before reversing course in the third quarter of
2005 as capital outflows led the Bank of Jamaica (BOJ) to step up market interventions
to support the Jamaican dollar.
The nominal exchange rate has depreciated in recent months. After remaining relatively
unchanged for about a year, the Jamaican dollar depreciated briskly during June–
November 2005 and continued to weaken during February–March, 2006. In real
effective terms, however, given the high inflation, the Jamaican dollar appreciated by
9 percent on average during 2005.
Fiscal targets have been missed. Hurricane Ivan was largely responsible for the failure
to achieve both revenue and expenditure objectives in FY 2004/05. Relative to the
authorities’ targets, the revenue shortfalls have widened during FY 2005/06 as revenue
collections have fallen. As regards expenditures, notwithstanding the flooding and
infrastructure damage associated with the 2005 hurricanes, spending was kept under
tight restraint—in particular, capital expenditures were squeezed further. Revised
budget estimates recently approved by parliament, envisage, however, some increase
in expenditures for the year as a whole, including on account of allowances and
pensions. The budgetary shortfalls have been financed successfully, including through
the very successful placement of several Eurobonds.
Monetary policy has been geared at containing inflation while also seeking to engender
a sustainable reduction in interest rates. These policies, combined with successive
rounds of monetary tightening in the United States, have narrowed the Jamaican-U.S.
interest rate differential by about 330 basis points since end-2004. Nevertheless, with
strong capital inflows, foreign exchange reserves increased rapidly through mid-2005.
The reserve build-up was fully sterilized by sales of central bank bills. Foreign exchange
reserves have however fallen modestly in recent months.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that, since late 2004, Jamaica’s economy had experienced a
series of major natural disasters, as well as external shocks arising from increases in oil
prices and global interest rates. Output growth had slowed, inflation had risen more than
envisaged, and the external current account balance had weakened. At the same time,
revenue collection had also fallen sharply. These developments had put considerable
strain on the authorities’ medium-term socio-economic policy framework, whose aim of
reducing the public debt burden was centered on balancing the budget for the current
fiscal year—a goal that now appears out of reach. Directors noted that the near-term
economic outlook remains vulnerable to shocks, and that the debt dynamics remain
highly sensitive to macroeconomic volatility and market sentiment.

-3-

Against this background, and given the extraordinarily high level of public debt, Directors
cautioned that the authorities have very limited room for policy maneuver, and urged
them to remain steadfast in implementing the policies necessary to achieve the
objectives of their macroeconomic strategy. Directors considered that ambitious fiscal
consolidation and a prudent debt management strategy will be required to create a
virtuous cycle of reduced debt, low inflation, and improved living standards for the
Jamaican population. It will also be important to make further progress on structural
reforms aimed at reducing the economy’s vulnerabilities and improving long-term growth
potential.
Directors noted that the authorities’ strategy to reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio requires a
strong, sustained fiscal effort. They considered it imperative to achieve a balanced
budget as soon as feasible and to avoid recurring fiscal slippages. In this regard,
Directors welcomed the authorities’ continued commitment, despite difficult
circumstances, to limit the size of deviations from fiscal targets and to eliminate deficits
over the medium term. Most Directors concurred that the authorities’ fiscal objectives
should be more ambitious than currently envisaged. Moreover, if the economy improves
more than is currently envisaged, Directors encouraged the authorities to target a
balanced budget for FY 2006/07. Some Directors cautioned that there is not much
scope for postponing infrastructure investment and social and poverty-reducing
programs. Directors encouraged the authorities to develop contingency plans to deal
with possible further shocks.
Directors noted that realizing the budgetary objectives for FY 2006/07 and beyond will
require both revenue measures and expenditure discipline, while the medium-term fiscal
outlook depends critically on the outcome of wage negotiations. They encouraged the
authorities to consider measures to broaden the tax base, eliminate exemptions and
preferences, and pursue tax delinquents in a more vigorous manner. Directors also
underscored the importance of broader fiscal reforms aimed at increasing the
productivity of the public sector, and at reforming public enterprises to limit the debt
burden arising from off-budget entities. Directors urged the authorities to use new
concessional debt to replace costlier financing, instead of expanding the overall
expenditure envelope.
Directors emphasized the need for careful conduct of monetary and exchange rate
policies in the period ahead, in view of the recent slowdown in growth and the narrowing
interest rate differentials, which could exert pressures on the capital account.
They noted that a gradual, preemptive tightening of monetary policy is likely to prove
more supportive of fiscal and growth objectives than an accommodative and reactive
approach. A number of Directors viewed the recent portfolio shifts as transitory in
nature, as financial market conditions have remained favorable and inflation
expectations have fallen. In any event, Directors welcomed the authorities’ readiness to
increase interest rates, if warranted by the prevailing economic conditions.
They underscored the importance of maintaining a flexible exchange rate regime,
aimed at safeguarding the external competitiveness of the economy.

-4-

Directors noted that robust and sustained economic growth is critical to the authorities’
macroeconomic strategy. To this end, they urged the authorities to accelerate structural
reforms, with a view to ensuring that the current high levels of investment translate into
greater productivity and efficiency, and to improving the business environment in
general. Tax reforms should be implemented in a comprehensive manner, aimed
particularly at creating a level playing field and increasing transparency. In addition,
efforts should be continued to improve access to credit, enhance labor market flexibility,
and strengthen law and order. Given Jamaica’s exposure to both adverse natural events
and changes in financial market sentiment and the limited scope under the authorities’
strategy to accommodate such risks, Directors emphasized the importance of
persevering with efforts to strengthen institutional capacity to withstand such adversities.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ participation in the Financial Sector Assessment
Program and their commitment to continue to strengthen the resilience of the financial
system in line with the recommendations. They welcomed improvements in recent years
in the quality and structure of supervision and increases in capital levels in most
financial institutions. Directors nevertheless saw scope for further developing
supervisory capacity, strengthening the oversight of financial conglomerates, and
tightening prudential requirements for securities dealers. They encouraged the
authorities to continue to upgrade the statistical systems, with a view to subscribing to
the Special Data Dissemination Standard. Expanding financial surveys to cover
nonbank entities will be an important step in that regard. Directors also recommended
that the authorities address remaining gaps in the AML/CFT framework.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the
IMF's views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV
consultations with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of
post-program monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term
program engagements. PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy
matters, unless otherwise decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.
