STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
November 16, 2012

KEY ISSUES
Context: Despite the global slowdown, Cambodia’s economic performance has been
holding up driven by resilient exports, robust tourism, and construction. However, a
fragile global economic outlook, rapid credit growth, and potentially extreme weather
conditions continue to pose significant risks. Discussions focused on fiscal and financial
sector policies to address near-term risks and, supported by appropriate structural
reforms, help reduce structural vulnerabilities and create more self-sustaining and
inclusive growth. Notwithstanding mixed progress, the authorities have remained fully
committed to implementing past surveillance recommendations, including rebuilding
fiscal space, improving the credibility of monetary policy, and implementing key
2010 FSAP recommendations.
Creating more fiscal space: Rebuilding fiscal space, starting with the 2013 budget and
continuing to mobilize revenue over the medium term, underpins prudent fiscal and
public debt management, which form the bedrock of macroeconomic stability. The
government’s new revenue-mobilization strategy should fully leverage on simultaneous
reforms in revenue administration, tax policies, and governance. Careful management of
fiscal risks by monitoring contingent liabilities is the key to safeguarding fiscal space.
Improving monetary policy and financial supervision: While inflation is expected to
remain low, private credit has continued to grow rapidly with limited availability and use
of instruments of control. Given the robust economic expansion, the recent increase in
the reserve requirement constitutes a critical step toward safeguarding financial stability,
although further increases and additional measures may be needed to guard against
excessive risk taking by banks. Developing an interbank market remains a necessary first
step for a transition to more effective and market-based monetary policy operations.
Main priorities in implementing 2010 FSAP recommendations are establishing an
adequate and well-coordinated system of financial supervision, and further
strengthening the supervisory capacity.
Promoting broad-based and inclusive growth: Improvements in macroeconomic
management can enable a virtuous cycle of more self-sustaining and inclusive growth if
they are supported by steadfast structural reforms to facilitate private sector-led
economic diversification, improve public finance management, and ensure greater
efficiency of public spending and budget transparency.

OUTLOOK AND RISK
1.
Growth and inflation: Despite the global slowdown, Cambodia’s economy has been
holding up, driven by resilient exports and tourism and a strong real estate recovery (Figure 1 and
Table 1). Although moderating, garment exports continued to expand by 10 percent (y/y) during the
first three quarters of 2012, in part thanks to improved access to the European Union. Tourist arrivals
have been particularly robust, benefitting from new flight routes. Construction activity is picking up
thanks to the real estate rebound, in part fuelled by rapid credit growth, and the 2011 flood impact
on agriculture has been much less severe than

is expected to average 3–4 percent in
2012‒13 amid stable domestic food prices.
2.
External stability: Notwithstanding a widening current account deficit, Cambodia’s overall
external position has remained stable.


The current account deficit (including official transfers) is projected to peak at 10 percent of
GDP in 2012, reflecting moderating exports and temporarily higher imports related to large
infrastructure projects, but the deficit remains fully financed by large foreign direct investment
(FDI) and official loans (Figure 2). Over the medium term, the deficit would narrow to
5½ percent of GDP, broadly in line with estimates of Cambodia’s savings-investment norm,
driven by robust export growth on improved competitiveness and diversification, and slower
1
import growth reflecting the completion of large projects (Table 3).



Gross official reserves have continued their steady rise to US$3.4 billion in September, about
four months of prospective imports. This reserve coverage appears to be adequate considering

In addition to the macroeconomic balance, the equilibrium exchange rate approach does not point to evidence of
exchange rate misalignment either with medium-term estimates ranging between –½ percent to less than 4 percent
of misalignment. However, firm conclusions from such models cannot be drawn, given Cambodia’s weak data, rapid
structural change, and high degree of dollarization.

the high degree of dollarization, with privately held foreign currency deposits at about 1½ times
of gross official reserve, and the long-term nature of most of Cambodia’s external debt. On the
other hand, the high degree of dollarization is severely limiting the central bank’s
lender-of-last-resort capability. Therefore, a higher level of optimal reserves may be warranted,
even though the associated confidence effects are difficult to quantify.

KEY ISSUES FOR THE CONSULTATION
A. Creating More Fiscal Space Through Revenue Mobilization
4.
Context: Rebuilding fiscal space over the past two years has fallen short of initial budget
targets set during previous Article IV consultations.


In 2011 revenue collection stayed flat in terms of GDP, compared to a ½ percentage point of
GDP increase targeted by the Public Financial Management Reform Program (PFMRP). Although
current spending remained under control, the overall fiscal balance deteriorated because
foreign-financed capital spending was substantially larger than budgeted, indicating that control
of donor-financed capital spending remains fragmented.



In 2012, however, tax collection up to August rose by nearly 1 percentage point of GDP over the
same period in 2011, thanks to improved revenue administration underpinned by the hiring of
some 200 new tax auditors and buoyant domestic demand. Provided that current spending
remains in check, the fiscal deficit including grants is projected to narrow to 3¼ percent of GDP
while domestic financing would drop by ¾ percentage point of GDP and be nearly eliminated
(Figure 3, and Tables 4 and 5).



Nevertheless, the stock of government deposits, the only readily available fiscal buffer for
Cambodia, is expected to decline to about 4 percent of GDP in 2012, about half its precrisis level
and only 1¼ percentage points of GDP above the minimum threshold to sustain financing
shocks (IMF CR 12/46, Box 1).



Against this background, discussions focused on ensuring that the 2013 budget would lock in
gains from improved revenue performance and pave the way for further fiscal consolidation,
formulating a comprehensive medium-term revenue mobilization strategy (RMS), and
minimizing fiscal risks from contingent liabilities.

5.
Striking a careful balance in the 2013 budget: The staff and authorities agreed that in line
with past staff’s advise, fiscal policy should remain anchored in rebuilding government deposits and
maintaining long-term fiscal debt sustainability, while providing adequate financing for Cambodia’s
vast development needs. In particular:


Staff welcomed the intention in the 2013 budget proposal to begin rebuilding the deposit buffer
by about riel 100 billion through further raising of revenue collection by ½ percentage point of
GDP and restraining the overall current expenditures, despite an increase in the public wage bill
of about ¼ percentage point of GDP.



The authorities concurred with staff on the need to resist further calls for public wage increases
in the election year. From a cross-country perspective, Cambodia’s wage bill at about
4¾ percent of GDP (after the increase) is comparable to that in other Asian low-income



There was also broad agreement that in light of the limited fiscal space, contingency planning
for a potential economic downturn should focus on accelerating high-impact social and
infrastructure outlays under existing medium-term development projects and ensuring the
effectiveness of this spending.



The 2013 budget would also pave the way for implementing the authorities’ commitment to
gradual fiscal consolidation over the medium term while maintaining an adequate level of
capital spending. Reducing the fiscal deficit (excluding grants) from about 6 percent of GDP in
2012 to less than 3 percent in 2017 would reduce public external debt to the precrisis level of
27 percent of GDP by 2017 and help replenish government deposits to about 5–6 percent of
GDP over the medium term. It would thus bolster Cambodia’s low risk of debt distress rating
and its ability to absorb future shocks.2

6.
Mobilizing revenue: Greater mobilization of fiscal revenues is imperative to rebuild government
deposits in order to avoid undesirable spending cuts in the near term, and to meet Cambodia’s vast
development needs and maintain fiscal sustainability in the long term. Staff strongly supported the
government’s plan of an RMS and provided inputs to a strategy that prioritized recommendations
consistent with various IMF technical assistance (TA) efforts into a set of achievable and well-sequenced
measures. To make greater revenue mobilization self sustaining, staff also emphasized that the strategy
should rely on an integrated approach of improving revenue administration, implementing fair and
efficient tax policies, and strengthening governance (Box 1 and Table 6). The authorities broadly agreed
with the three-pronged approach and the policy priorities, and they plan to start with easy,

2

The accompanying Debt Sustainability Analysis indicates that Cambodia’s debt distress rating remains low. External
debt disbursement is projected at about 2–3 percent of GDP per year with key funding parameters, including the
degree of concessionality and the lack of a domestic debt market, broadly unchanged from past trends. Under an
alternative scenario of limited reform progress, however, there would be less scope for absorbing risks
(Supplement 1).

domestic revenue increased from 6½ percent of GDP in 2003 to more than 10 percent in 2008. Since then,
however, revenue has stayed flat in terms of GDP, although there have been signs of improvement in 2012.
Greater revenue mobilization will likely only become
harder over time. Cambodia’s tax-to-GDP ratio remains
low by regional standards, mainly because of weak
administration. Moreover, apart from domestic taxes,
revenue growth may slow over time with the
contribution of trade taxes in total revenue set to decline
with ASEAN Free Trade Area implementation.

implementing fair and efficient tax policies, and
strengthening governance. Simultaneous reforms in these three areas are critical because good progress in
one area would create positive feedback to the others, making revenue mobilization more effective and self
sustaining. For example, reforming tax administration focusing on good taxpayer services and collecting tax
arrears would make the tax system de facto more efficient and fairer while at the same time improve
compliance and reduce the incentives for corruption and evasion. Successful tax reforms in many developing
countries have relied on an integrated approach where strengthening revenue administration and reforming
tax policy, supported by strong political will and technical capacity, play a critical role in enhancing revenue
collection.
To prioritize policy actions, the focus should be on those measures that would generate substantial
additional revenue, create strong positive externalities, and can be implemented with low or medium
cost. These include:

 Revenue administration: Collecting tax debt and improving the performance of the LTD would raise
additional revenue in the near term. For example, total tax debt is estimated at 4 percent of GDP.
Reprioritizing reform plans toward revenue-generating activities, establishing taxpayer services,
developing human resources and information technology, and strengthening revenue forecasting would
sustain revenue efforts going forward.

 Tax policy: Reforming value-added tax (VAT) and excise taxes would generate an immediate revenue
impact. For example, bringing the VAT productivity to a level comparable with those in other Asian
low-income countries would yield additional revenue of 1½ percent of GDP (IMF CR 11/45). Continued
rationalization of tax exemptions and incentives, corporate and personal income taxes, and property taxes
would help raise revenue over the medium term.

 Governance: Strengthening oversight and accountability of tax institutions and promoting transparency
are critical to improve the performance and credibility of tax institutions.

implementable, and low-cost measures. They also plan to build consensus during a participatory
process in the coming months and present the RMS to the new government after the 2013 general
election.
7.
Minimizing fiscal risk: As highlighted in the 2011 Article IV consultation, contingent
liabilities related to the development of power generation and transmission projects under
public-private partnership (PPP) constitute a substantial fiscal risk (IMF CR 12/46, DSA). The size of
the projects (about 50 percent of 2011 GDP) and the difficulty to quantify the liabilities ex ante
require continuous and careful monitoring. The authorities indicated that efforts are underway
through a subdecree to the recently published public debt management strategy to strengthen the
evaluation, contracting, and monitoring of contingent liabilities, including in the preparation for a
review of the legal framework for PPPs and the development of a new guarantee policy. However,
apparent information gaps remain between government agencies on the size and status of contracts
and embedded government guarantees. Staff recommended improving information sharing with a
view to setting up a central PPP-monitoring unit with “gateway powers” to evaluate and approve
new PPP projects, enhancing fiscal transparency by adopting a ceiling on PPP guarantees, and listing
all contingent liabilities and underlying guarantees in annual budget laws. The authorities are
committed to further enhancing budget transparency and control and are seeking TA from various
donors to bring practices closer in line with staff’s recommendations.

B. Improving Effectiveness and Credibility of Monetary Policy
8.
Context: Given a high degree of dollarization and absent an interbank market, the National
Bank of Cambodia’s (NBC) control over monetary conditions remains limited with the exchange rate
against the U.S. dollar continuing to serve as an important nominal anchor.3 Inflation has moderated
and is expected to average about 4 percent in 2013, reflecting stable global commodity prices and
domestic food supply, as well as alleviating supply constraints related to infrastructure
improvements. However, recent developments suggest that the challenges to monetary policy are
shifting. Private credit has continued to grow rapidly, fuelled by easy domestic and, to a lesser
extent, global financial conditions (Figure 4 and Table 7). Private sector credit growth in Cambodia––
at over 30 percent through September––is among the highest in Asia. At this rate of expansion, the
size of private credit relative to GDP, which is already substantially higher than for comparator
countries, is quickly deviating from Cambodia’s past trend of financial deepening (Box 2). Meanwhile
the coverage of foreign currency deposits by official reserves has steadily fallen, further limiting the
NBC’s capacity to act as a lender-of-last resort. In view of this, discussions focused on steps to
further improve monetary policy effectiveness and credibility, in particular by addressing
macrofinancial risk and developing the interbank market.

The current IMF classification of the exchange rate regime is “stabilized.”

Addressing macrofinancial risk: Staff welcomed the recent rise in the reserve requirement
for foreign currency deposits by 50 basis points from its postcrisis low of 12 percent, which is
consistent with the robust economic expansion and constitutes a critical step towards safeguarding
financial stability. Given rapid credit growth and the still-large excess liquidity in the banking system,
further gradual increases may be warranted. At the same time, recent developments also suggest
that the transmission from higher reserve requirements to interest rates and credit activity may have
been weakened further. Therefore, staff also recommended to consider adopting complementary
macroprudential measures that could help curb credit growth and increase banks’ risk buffers, while
minimizing any potential distortions (for a preliminary assessment see Box 2). The authorities
broadly agreed with staff’s assessment and the potential need for further increases of the reserve
requirement. Given their uncertain impact, they prefer to move gradually, allowing continuous
monitoring of changes in domestic financing conditions and for signaling effects to take hold. In
addition, the authorities are also considering a range of complementary macroprudential measures
to safeguard financial stability, without penalizing those banks with relatively strong lending
standards. The IMF stands ready to provide TA as the NBC further evaluates its options by striking a
careful balance between ease of implementation, effectiveness, and competitive distortions of such
measures.4
10.
Developing an interbank market: An interbank market is an important first step
toward more effective and market-based monetary policy operations. Upon request by the
NBC, staff provided a strategy note arguing that the introduction of negotiable riel and U.S.
dollar-denominated certificates of deposits (NCDs), issued by the NBC and to be used as collateral
to help kick-start an interbank market, should be at a controlled pace, carefully communicated, and
accompanied, as needed, by the use of available tools to ensure consistency with the national
strategy of promoting the riel.5 The authorities agreed with staff’s recommendations and asked for
further TA to operationally launch NCDs, including setting up the auction mechanism and
developing the secondary market for them. Staff welcomed the NBC’s efforts to consult with the
Bankers’ Association to help ensure the success of the initiative. In addition, there was agreement
that a well-functioning foreign exchange market would support the interbank market, with staff
welcoming progress made by the NBC in line with IMF TA in encouraging private wholesalers’
participation in the foreign exchange market.6

4
Sectoral lending guidance, a tool used by the NBC in the past, has also been discussed, but, so far, credit growth
has been broad based. While personal mortgages have expanded at a faster-than-average rate, growth has been
from a small base and associated risks have been mitigated by the creation of the Cambodia Credit Bureau in March
2012.
5

The NBC remains committed to this strategy (IMF CR/11/45) through a gradual approach with market-based
incentives in favor of the local currency.
6

Since mid-2011, the NBC has stopped buying riel directly from the Electricité du Cambodge (EDC), the state-owned
electricity company, and instead has been facilitating transactions between EDC and money changers and to lesser
extent commercial banks.

Cambodia’s past trend of credit-to-GDP is another
simple proxy for the normal pace of financial
deepening. To the extent that the actual ratio of
credit-to-GDP deviates significantly from its trend, one
might interpret it as a sign of overheating in the credit
market. This ‘credit gap’ measure has indeed been
empirically shown to be a good predictor of financial
stress. /2 At 30 percent credit growth, the gap measure
would rapidly widen and by early 2013 would surpass a
level last seen in 2008, at the height of Cambodia’s real
estate boom, which ended in a bust. Projecting this
expansion further shows that Cambodia’s credit
trajectory is clearly breaking away from the country’s
own long-term pace of financial deepening.

Credit to GDP Relative to Peers

Jul-05



Cambodia’s financial system is expanding rapidly. With
private credit growing at over 30 percent in the past
12 months, the credit-to-GDP ratio has reached
37 percent, well above the median for low-income
economies (LICs). If credit growth were to continue at
the current pace, by mid-2013 the ratio would exceed
even the median for more advanced emerging market
economies (EM). These benchmarks suggest that the
size of Cambodia’s financial system has already
outstripped the level that can be justified by normal
financial deepening. 1/

Macroprudential measures may be needed. In addition to raising the reserve requirement, currently the only
tool at the disposal of the National Bank of Cambodia (NBC), consideration should be given to macroprudential
measures. At present, the reserve requirement does not automatically mean tighter credit conditions as many
Cambodian banks still have excess liquidity, a number of them are lowering interest rate spreads to compete for
market share, and some increasingly rely on cheaper external funding from foreign banks. Commercial banks’
foreign liabilities have more than doubled to US$1.2 billion in September 2012.
What measures and trade-offs? In considering macroprudential measures, the NBC must strike a balance
between choosing an instrument that is simple to implement, effective in slowing credit growth, and causes the
least distortions to the credit market. For example, adopting a capital surcharge would be relatively simple, create
few distortions, but may be less effective in an already booming credit market where capital is boosted by
profitability. Also, the capital-to-asset ratio of 29 percent reported by Cambodian banks is already much higher
than the regional average. On the other hand, tightening the loan-to-value (LTV) cap, while potentially effective,
may be less practical due to difficulties in asset valuations and the already low LTV (typically 35 percent) reportedly
adopted by many banks. Capping the loan-to-deposit ratio, which has risen to 89 percent from 82 percent at end
2010, can also be effective, but would have a disproportionate impact on foreign bank branches that rely less on
their deposit base, potentially causing distortions to competition.

C. Further Strengthening Financial Supervision
11.
Context: Important challenges to financial stability remain, even if standard financial
soundness indicators suggest some modest improvement in recent years (Table 8). Progress in
implementing high-priority 2010 FSAP recommendations has been mixed (Table 9), reflecting in part
capacity constraints and the need to forge consensus within the government. The NBC has taken a
stricter stance on bank licensing, restructured its banking supervision, and addressed credit risks by
introducing a new credit reporting system coinciding with the launching of a credit information
bureau. However, a crisis management framework encompassing key financial supervisors is still
lacking, while improving the capacity of banking supervision remains a challenge.
12.
Coordinated supervision: In the absence of financial safety nets and the lack of the NBC’s
lender-of-last-resort capability, strengthening the financial crisis-management framework remains
key to reducing systemic risks. Cambodia’s recent economic upswing offers an opportune window
to agree on memoranda of understanding (MoUs) between the NBC, the Ministry of Economy and
Finance, and the Stock Exchange Commission of Cambodia on establishing a coordinated
supervision framework. To help expedite the process, staff proposed a two-step approach:
(i) identify areas where cooperation, including information sharing, can be readily achieved for the
signing of an initial MoU that focuses on coordinated surveillance and crisis prevention, and
(ii) agree on a time-bound process toward a second MoU on crisis resolution in order to complete
the crisis management framework. The roles and responsibilities of each supervisory agency would
need to be clearly defined for the purpose of responsibility and cost sharing, and further TA could
be provided to help review the existing laws and regulations. The authorities agreed in principle with
this two-step approach and indicated that a working group has been set up to look into areas of
cooperation in information sharing, joint analysis on risk factors, and exploring the introduction of a
crisis-resolution framework.
13.
Risk-based supervision: The NBC has made progress in transitioning from a
compliance-based to risk-based supervision. With IMF TA support, the supervision department has
started to conduct risk forecasting on individual banks and on a consolidated basis. Off-site
examination teams have begun to compile risk profiles to be used for making on-site inspection
plans. A working group was formed to review the compliance with Basel Core Principles and has
concluded a detailed assessment.
14.
Supervisory capacity: Rapid expansion of the financial system and the shift toward risk-based
supervision have placed an additional burden on still-stretched supervisory capacity (Box 3). In this
context, staff noted that the 2010 FSAP recommendation of a bank licensing moratorium remains
appropriate. To bring policies effectively closer in line with this recommendation, staff supported the
NBC’s more cautious stance on bank licensing procedures, which encourages potential applicants to
consider mergers with existing banks. Staff also recommended focusing resources on key examination
functions and strengthening training for inexperienced supervisors. The authorities concurred with staff’s
views and agreed to continue efforts in building supervisory capacity.

Box 3. Recent Trends in Supervisory Capacity
Ensuring adequate human resources in banking supervision has been a long-standing issue for the
National Bank of Cambodia (NBC) that featured prominently in the 2010 FSAP. Notwithstanding
improvements in the quality of supervision, including investments in training, data collection, and a greater
focus on risk-based supervision, the relative shortage of staff, particularly the more experienced and
qualified staff, has become a more binding constraint for several reasons.
First, Cambodia’s banking sector has experienced
rapid growth over the past years. The number of
banks reached 39 by mid-2012, almost double from
that in 2006, and seven more since the 2010 FSAP.
The balance sheet of the banking sector has
increased significantly. From 2010 to mid-2012, total
bank assets and loans have both increased by more
than 50 percent and total bank deposits by
40 percent.

Second, in quantitative terms, banking
supervisory capacity at the NBC has been
stretched during the same period especially
compared with the growth of the banking
system. The total number of bank supervisors in the
Banking Supervision General Directorate (BSD)
decreased from 68 in 2010 to 54 in mid-2012.1/
Among them, experienced supervisors decreased
from 52 to 41. Moreover, the transition from
compliance-based supervision to risk-based and
forward-looking supervision has increased the
demand for experienced and qualified staff to
conduct risk-profile assessments, on-site and off-site
examinations, analysis of findings, and stress testing.

D. Promoting Diversification and Inclusive Growth
15.
Context: Cambodia’s economic base remains concentrated in a few sectors with growth
being more volatile than in most other Asian low-income countries. Cambodia’s rank of Doing
Business indicators recently moved up five places to 133 in 2012 (between India at 132 and the
Philippines at 138) out of 185 countries, thanks in part to easier credit access and better credit
information with the opening of the Cambodian credit bureau in March 2012, while other indicators
remained low. Infrastructure bottlenecks and skilled-labor shortages continue to hamper investment
and rural development. On the other hand, relatively open trade and investment regimes and
Cambodia’s strategic location close to the world’s fastest growing markets offer potential in terms of
exports markets and inward investment. Recent FDI trends point to early signs of manufacturing

objectives. However, there was broad agreement that a sound macrofinancial management would
stand a better chance of enabling a virtuous cycle of more self-sustaining and inclusive growth if it is
complemented by the following structural reforms:



Promoting diversification: The ongoing efforts in reducing infrastructure and skills bottlenecks,
improving the investment climate by strengthening enforcement of the anti-corruption law and
the anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) regime, and
promoting rural development remain important planks of reforms. The government’s Rice Policy
aimed at facilitating agricultural production, downstream processing, and trade, by raising
productivity, enabling farmers to use land as collateral, and improving critical infrastructure,
would help diversify the economy and achieve the MDGs. A better rural infrastructure would
also provide better access to employment, health, and education services in rural areas, thus
helping to alleviate Cambodia’s rural-urban income divide and making growth more inclusive.

7

Data from Japan International Cooperation Agency, for example, suggest that Japanese FDI in Cambodia is rising
rapidly, from a commitment of about US$35 million in 2010 to some US$420 million in 2012, with the bulk of it
comprising factories relocating from China.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND



Strengthening public financial management: Improvements in public service delivery depend
in part on progress under the PFMRP to ensure greater spending effectiveness and budget
transparency. The composition of government spending including on social priority sectors is
largely in line with other comparator countries, but, as indicated in a recent World Bank report,
spending efficiency could be improved, including by reallocating resources towards agricultural
research, scholarships and textbooks, and realizing savings in the provision of medical supplies.8
Meanwhile, budget execution and recording of donor-financed capital spending continue to be
fragmented and hamper the alignment of projects with policy priorities and medium-term
budget planning. Against this background, staff called for improved coordination with donors
and greater efforts by all stakeholders to adhere to new reporting procedures under the Budget
Strategic Plans.



Improving official data: Providing accurate and timely official economic and financial data
would enhance policy formulation and credibility, and facilitate better and informed decisions by
the private sector.

STAFF APPRAISAL
17.
Economic setting: Despite the global slowdown, Cambodia’s economic performance
has been holding up thanks to resilient garment exports and robust domestic demand. The
medium-term prospects for growth to reach its potential of about 7½ percent continue to hinge
critically on the global economic recovery and ongoing reforms to upgrade the infrastructure and
promote economic diversification, as well as enhance public sector revenue and service delivery.
Inflation has decelerated despite the recent surge in global food prices, and is expected to remain
low in 2012–13. Cambodia’s external position remains stable with an adequate level of international
reserves, and the REER appear to remain broadly in line with economic fundamentals.
18.
Risks and policy response: Spillovers from a deepening euro area crisis and global financial
turbulence continue to expose Cambodia’s narrow economic base to considerable risks. On the domestic
side, rapid credit growth and excessive risk taking by banks could threaten financial stability, labor
market tensions could disrupt textile exports, and extreme weather conditions could affect agricultural
production. Cambodia’s high degree of dollarization leaves fiscal policy as the main tool to absorb
shocks, but limited fiscal buffers mean that the room for policy maneuver remains severely curtailed.
19.
Fiscal policy: Staff welcomes recent improvements in revenue collection and the 2013 draft
budget’s intention to begin replenishing government deposits. Greater revenue mobilization is
imperative to rebuild fiscal buffers in the near term if difficult spending cuts are to be avoided, and to
meet Cambodia’s vast development needs and maintain fiscal sustainability in the long term. To make
revenue mobilization self sustaining, the strategy should rely on an integrated approach of improving
8

CAMBODIA

revenue administration, implementing fair and efficient tax policies, and strengthening governance.
Careful management of fiscal risk by better monitoring of contingent liabilities related to PPPs is also
important to safeguarding fiscal space.
20.
Monetary policy: Staff welcomes the recent rise in the reserve requirement, which is consistent
with the robust economic expansion. The increase in the reserve requirement constitutes a critical step
toward safeguarding financial stability, but further gradual increases may be warranted, and additional
macroprudential measures may be needed to guard against potential excessive risk taking by banks.
Staff also looks forward to the introduction of negotiable certificates of deposits (NCDs) to help develop
an interbank market, which remains a necessary first step for a transition to more effective and
market-based monetary policy operations.
21.
Financial supervision: Progress continues to be made in implementing the 2010 FSAP
recommendations, but more decisive actions are needed in establishing an adequate and
well-coordinated system of financial supervision. Cambodia’s recent economic upswing offers an
opportune window to agree on MoUs between supervisory agencies on information exchange and crisis
resolution. The NBC’s overall supervisory capacity has improved, but is still stretched in view of the rapid
expansion of the financial system and the shift toward risk-based supervision. In this context, the
2010 FSAP recommendation of a bank licensing moratorium remains appropriate. In addition, the
AML/CFT regime needs to be strengthened.
22.
Diversification and inclusive growth: A sound macrofinancial management can enable a
virtuous cycle of more self-sustaining and inclusive growth if it is complemented by steadfast
implementation of structural reforms to facilitate private sector-led diversification and strengthen public
finance management, as well as the timely provision of economic data. The ongoing efforts in reducing
infrastructure and skills bottlenecks, improving the investment climate by strengthening enforcement of
the anti-corruption law, and promoting rural development remain important policy planks of making
growth broader based and more inclusive. Continued progress under the PFMRP would improve public
service delivery and ensure greater spending effectiveness and budget transparency.
23.

It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard 12-month

cycle.

Table 6. Cambodia: Priorities and Policies for Revenue Mobilization
Priority Areas

Policy Measures
1. Revenue Administration

Debt collection: Start collecting large tax debt. Even a small
proportion would generate significant additional revenue.

(1) Establish a task force to start addressing the most significant debt cases; (2) Develop
protocols to delegate powers from Deputy Prime Minister; (3) Develop tax installment
payment arrangements.

Large Taxpayer Department (LTD): It provides about 80
percent of tax collection, but its performance reached a plateau
in recent years.

(1) Create a team within LTD to develop and maintain understanding of every large
taxpayer including their behavior and risks; (2) Include the LTD arrears cases in the debt
collection task force coverage; (3) Develop large taxpayer compliance strategy including
service initiatives; (4) Locate all large taxpayer risk assessment and audit functions to
LTD.

Taxpayer services: A comprehensive strategy is needed to pull

(1) Draw up action plans to ensure the implementation of the Department for Tax

together the various elements of service delivery in order to
improve taxpayers' compliance.

Services and Tax Arrears (DTSTA) operational work plan; (2) Continue seeking
development partners to design and roll out a comprehensive taxpayer service strategy
and allocate sufficient resources to taxpayer services functions; (3) Provide public
information about avenues of appeal available for taxpayers.

Planning: Tax institutions have limited planning capacity and
limited progress has been made in implementing action plans.

(1) Review the operational plans to prioritize activities and tasks, identify the resource
needs, and set realistic targets; (2) Establish central reform office to implement and
monitor reform programs.

Human resource and information technology (IT): Staffs are
skewed toward low value activities, while important functions
like taxpayer services and debt collection are understaffed. The
IT systems are inadequate.

(1) Reorganize staff allocation by prioritizing revenue mobilization functions; (2) Reform
recruitment process to quickly fill vacancies; (3) Establish an IT reform program,
including a dedicated full-time team and seek support from development partners.

Revenue forecasting: Weak revenue analysis partly due to
limited human resources and absence of automated systems
and an integrated database.

Strengthen revenue forecasting capacity at the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF),
General Department of Taxation (GDT), and General Department of Customs and Excise
(GDCE) and improve coordination between MEF, GDT, and GDCE in setting and
monitoring revenue targets.

Value Added Tax (VAT): Revenue productivity is low due to
narrow tax base, weak enforcement, and little information on
taxpayers of the estimated regime because they are not
registered.

(1) Apply one threshold to all types of tax payers; (2) Make registration with Tax ID
mandatory for all tax payers; (3) Eliminate exemptions for electricity; (4) Adopt partial
exemptions system for financial institutions by establishing rules to define the different
kinds of financial services.

Excise tax: The overall level of excise taxation is low due to

(1) Streamline the list of imported goods taxed; (2) Increase the number of petroleum

small amount of tax on standard excisable products.
Restructuring the excise system would generate immediate
revenue impact.

products taxed; (3) Consolidate the ad valorem and additional taxes on fuels into one
specific, indexed tax; (4) Increase excise tax and customs duty on diesel to equal tax on
gasoline; (5) Tax tobacco with specific, indexed excise tax.

Direct tax: Continue tax policy reforms on tax incentives,

(1) Remove or limit tax incentives, particularly on the Qualifying Investment Projects

corporate and personal income taxes, and property taxes.

(QIP) because Cambodia's tax regime is already competitive; (2) Increase tax collection
from the estimated regime by improving governance and transparency; (3) Continue the
Personal Income Tax (PIT) reforms; (4) Review the implementation of property tax before
expanding it across the country to ensure it works effectively.

2. Tax Policy

3. Governance
Oversight: Improve the oversight of the GDT's and GDCE's
operations and performance.

Create the political will to strengthen oversight and accountability, both of the GDT and
GDCE, and within the GDT and GDCE.

Transparency: Considerable officials' discretion in the
application of tax laws remains, partly due to weaknesses of
management systems, process, and controls, and limited
information and assistance to taxpayers.

(1) Create systematic programs for taxpayer education, advice and interpretation of the
laws; (2) Remove the complex system of tax negotiation, particularly in the estimated tax
regime, and abolish informal taxpayer-facing activities; (3) Strengthen management and
supervisory controls.

Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative
As part of the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI), the IMF Executive Board on January 5, 2006
approved relief on 100 percent of debt incurred by Cambodia to the IMF before January 1, 2005. This
resulted in the forgiving of all of Cambodia’s outstanding debt to the IMF, a total of SDR 56.8 million

CAMBODIA

(about US$82 million). The authorities intend to spend the resources over a number of years, initially on
rural irrigation projects. The National Bank of Cambodia (NBC) transferred the full MDRI proceeds to the
Ministry of Economy and Finance effective March 2006.
Safeguards Assessment
A voluntary safeguards assessment of the NBC was completed in January 2010 at the request of the
authorities, which updated the previous March 2004 voluntary assessment. The update assessment
found that the NBC had taken steps to strengthen aspects of its safeguards framework; however,
important recommendations proposed in 2004 were still outstanding, and some new risks had emerged
in the area of external audit.
Exchange Rate Arrangement and Payments System
Cambodia’s exchange regime is classified as stabilized. The de jure regime is a managed float. The
official exchange rate, which is expressed in riels per U.S. dollar, applies to all official external
transactions conducted by the central government and state enterprises, and is used for accounting
purposes by the NBC. It is determined by the foreign exchange market, with the official rate adjusted to
be within 1 percent of the market rate on a daily basis.
Cambodia accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 on January 1, 2002. Cambodia
maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers
for current international transactions.
Article IV Consultation
Cambodia is on the standard 12-month Article IV consultation cycle. The last Article IV consultation
discussions were held in Phnom Penh during November 24–December 8, 2011. The Executive Board
approved the staff report (IMF Country Report 12/46) on a lapse of time basis on February 3, 2012.
Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP)
The joint IMF-World Bank FSAP mission took place in March 2010 and the assessment was
completed in October 2010.
Technical Assistance
Technical assistance is currently focused on bank supervision, monetary operations, public financial
management, tax and customs administration, tax policies, macro-fiscal and revenue forecasting,
financial sector supervision, and macro-financial statistics. Delivery is through a resident advisor at
the NBC, peripatetic experts, and short-term visits from headquarters.
Resident Representative
The IMF Resident Representative in Phnom Penh (Mr. Faisal Ahmed) was appointed in July 2011.
From July 2010 to June 2011, the IMF’s Resident Representative for Indonesia (Mr. Milan Zavadjil)
also assumed the responsibilities for the Cambodian IMF office.

IMF-WORLD BANK COLLABORATION
(October 2012)
The Bank and the IMF country teams for Cambodia, led by Mr. Mathew Verghis (Sector
Manager, EASPR) and Mr. Olaf Unteroberdoerster (IMF Mission Chief for Cambodia), maintain a
close working relationship and have an active dialogue on a range of macroeconomic and structural
issues.
Recent key areas of cooperation and coordination include:


Macroeconomic policy advice to the authorities. The IMF and the World Bank staffs have
consulted each other on key macroeconomic policy messages to the authorities to avoid sending
conflicting messages. The two teams also regularly share information outside missions, and
discuss and exchange institutional views on key macroeconomic developments. Bank staff share
and discuss the quarterly fiscal monitor and review of macroeconomic developments. IMF staff
share policy notes and analytical background notes related to Article IV consultation missions.



Financial sector reform and FSAP. World Bank and IMF teams have worked closely together
while undertaking the 2010 FSAP, which was completed in October 2010. Following the
recommendations by the FSAP, technical assistance missions are now ongoing and close
coordination between the IMF and the World Bank continues.



Public financial management and tax and customs administration reform. Both institutions
are working to strengthen coordination of work on public financial management, and tax and
customs administration reform. Both teams share as much as possible the work done in this area.



Article IV consultations. IMF Article IV consultations regularly share their macroeconomic data
with the World Bank and hold working sessions to try and reconcile macroeconomic data sets.
The collaboration is closest on the debt sustainability analysis, a joint product, but extends more
broadly into other areas of the consultation as well. This is extremely important for both
institutions in Cambodia’s scarce data context. World Bank staff are also invited to and do
participate in some of the key meetings.



Structural reforms. The IMF staff and the World Bank teams have worked together to share
views on a range of other issues, including structural reforms for a better investment climate,
economic diversification, , customs modernization, and rural development.

The presence of a locally-based IMF resident representative (Mr. Faisal Ahmed) has further deepened
collaboration on economic and debt sustainability analysis and the IMF’s involvement on the Public
Financial Management Reform Program.
Based on the above partnership, the World Bank and the IMF share a common view about
Cambodia’s macroeconomic and structural reform priorities. These include:

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CAMBODIA



Sustaining growth. Real GDP growth is holding up despite the global slowdown. However, it
needs to be sustained with appropriate fiscal consolidation and continued management of the
banking sector risks, against the backdrop of global uncertainty. Removing impediments to
investments, reducing infrastructure and skills bottlenecks, promoting diversification, and
supporting rural development continue to be the key to promote self-sustaining and inclusive
growth.



Rebuilding fiscal space. Macroeconomic stability critically depends on prudent fiscal policies.
Fiscal space to address near-term downside risk is limited and greater fiscal consolidation efforts
are needed to rebuild fiscal buffers, including through improving revenue collection, prioritizing
spending, rebuilding government deposits, and better monitoring of contingent liabilities. Greater
mobilization of fiscal revenues is imperative if Cambodia is to meet its vast development needs
and maintain fiscal sustainability in the long run.



Improving effectiveness and credibility of monetary policy. Gradually raising the reserve
requirement is consistent with the robust economic expansion and constitutes critical step towards
safeguarding financial stability in light of rapid credit expansion. Developing an interbank market
remains a necessary step for a transition to a more effective and market based monetary policy
operations.



Safeguarding financial system stability. Implementing the key recommendations of the 2010
FSAP remains critical to safeguard financial stability. These include implementing a moratorium
on new bank licenses, strengthening coordinated supervision, developing the foreign exchange
market, and improving the supervisory capacity.



Improving governance. Both the World Bank and IMF have stressed the critical role of
governance in improving the quality of service delivery and the business environment.

The teams are committed to continue the close cooperation going forward. The table below
details the specific activities planned by the two country teams over the next 12-month period along
with their expected deliveries.

RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
(October 2012)
From 1992 through September 2012, the Asian Development Bank (AsDB) approved funding of
US$1,615.9 million including 63 loan projects and programs of US$1,360.26 million with low interest,
and 21 Asian Development Fund (ADF) grants of US$255.71 million to Cambodia for structural
reform programs and development projects. To date, 43 loan projects for a total of
US$927.54 million and 8 ADF grants of US$80.51 million have been completed.
The sector composition and loan/grant amount of the active portfolio is US$628.44 as of September
2012 for (i) agriculture and natural resources, US$151.31 million; (ii) education, US$81.93 million;
(iii) energy, US$20.81 million; (iv) finance, US$14.74; (v) health, nutrition, and social protection,
US$19.0 million; (vi) industry and trade, US$11.02 million; (vii) multi-sector, US$54.41 million;
(viii) public sector management, US$54.09 million; (ix) transport and communication,
US$200.12 million; and (x) water supply, sanitation, and waste management, US$21.0 million.
The AsDB’s overarching goal in Cambodia is inclusive and diversified economic growth and poverty
reduction. The AsDB’s Country Partnership Strategy ((CPS) 2011–13), endorsed in July 2011, supports
implementation of the government’s updated National Strategic Development Plan 2009–13 (NSDP
Update)1 and focuses on poverty reduction and inclusive growth with an integrated approach to
rural development; on the promotion of urban-rural linkages (including connectivity); and the
enhancement of human capital by improving rural water supply and sanitation, and access to quality
general education and industry-relevant technical and vocational education and training (TVET). The
CPS 2011–13 prioritizes five sectors: (i) transport; (ii) water supply, sanitation, and urban
development; (iii) agricultural and natural resources; (iv) education and training; and (v) finance, as
well as a facilitating sector, public sector management. The CPS also identifies four critical country
challenges of climate change, decentralization, rural-urban linkages, and regional cooperation. The
CPS incorporates five key cross-cutting themes into all activities—private sector development,
governance, gender equity, knowledge solutions, and partnerships.
The AsDB’s geographical focus remains the Tonle Sap basin where the CPS supports sustainable
natural resource use and management; stimulates the growth of competitive farms and rural
enterprises; builds sustainable rural infrastructure, including irrigation, to strengthen productivity,
market connectivity, and competitiveness; and improves food security and climate resilience in
agricultural production. AsDB interventions on transport will focus on expanding the provincial and
rural roads network to promote connectivity and trade and tourism activities in Cambodia and the
Greater Mekong Sub-region (GMS).
The AsDB will continue its support for the Cambodia Millennium Development Goal targets for
improved water supply and sanitation for the large number of people without access in urban and

rural areas. In urban areas, we will work to manage the challenges of rapid urbanization and provide
basic services and infrastructure to meet the needs of the poor and stimulate the growth of value
chains. The AsDB will develop urban environmental infrastructure (drainage, water supply, and
sanitation, as well as selective infrastructure to improve the business environment) in border towns
and secondary growth centers around the Tonle Sap basin. In education and training, the AsDB will
concentrate on the completion of nine years of basic education, leading to further education and
training by promoting equitable access and quality and focus on formal and informal TVET for men
and women to respond to labor market needs and the demands of business, and to improve rural
incomes.
In finance, the AsDB will continue its leading role in the financial sector to (i) consolidate the
banking reforms achieved to date, upgrade financial infrastructure, and strengthen the regulatory
capability of the National Bank of Cambodia; (ii) support microfinance expansion through regulatory
and institutional reforms, and consider appropriate reforms to stimulate SME finance; and
(iii) support ongoing reforms to develop the insurance industry. The AsDB will support
implementation of the recently updated Financial Sector Development Strategy (2011–20). The CPS
also includes support for government measures to deepen public sector management reform and
strengthen anticorruption measures. For decentralization and deconcentration, the AsDB will
support the program-based approach under the three-year implementation plan (2011–13) in
functional assignments, fiscal decentralization (including public financial management capacity
development), and sub-national financing mechanisms such as the Sub-National Investment Facility.
In the area of private sector development, the AsDB assists the government’s efforts in improving
competition policy and regulatory efficiency; strengthening the investment climate and innovation;
continuing trade policy reforms and trade facilitation (customs and sanitary and phytosanitary
standards for food safety); and leverage public-private partnership opportunities. Assistance has also
been provided to help the government improve its competitiveness at the GMS level through
reducing border-related costs and distortions; improving physical infrastructure; enhancing
transport and trade facilitation, including promoting compliance with SPS standards. Later
interventions would be more focused on improving the trade facilitation and logistical links to the
sub-region as systems and procedures become more developed and integrated.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(November 2012)
Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General. Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance. Extensive TA has been provided by the
IMF, United Nations Development Programme, AsDB, and World Bank, as well as from bilateral
partners, leading to substantial capacity improvements. Currently, Cambodia is participating in STA's
project on the Implementation of the System of National Accounts and International Comparison
Program, funded by the government of Japan. This project will provide TA to build statistical capacity
and improve both national accounts and price statistics. However, various shortcomings in
macroeconomic data still hamper timely and comprehensive analysis.
National accounts. Although major improvements have been implemented in recent years,
weaknesses remain in the quality and timeliness of data. With IMF assistance, the National Institute
of Statistics (NIS) continues working to improve the quality of national accounts statistics in
accordance with the System of National Accounts 1993, to expand the scope of annual national
account aggregates, and to produce a quarterly national accounts series beginning with June 2005.
The quality of GDP estimates remains hampered by the lack of comprehensive and reliable source
data on a production and expenditure basis, in part stemming from the need to address resource
constraints and improve data collection techniques. The authorities recently published the
2011 national accounts; however, a TA mission that visited Cambodia in November 2011 noted
inconsistencies in the 2009 data that should be addressed. The November 2011 mission assessed
current methodologies used to compile national accounts estimates and provided support with the
development of the quarterly national accounts estimates. A mission to assess progress
implementing improvements is planned for January 2013. Follow up TA missions within the threeyear STA project will focus on improving the accuracy of the annual and quarterly GDP and
expanding the scope of the national accounts. Statistics Sweden is also providing support and
technical assistance with improving the national accounts for Cambodia.
Price statistics. The compilation of the consumer price index (CPI) suffers from insufficient coverage.
An updated CPI series was introduced starting in April 2012. Geographic coverage of the series has
been expanded to include Phnom Penh plus five provinces. Statistics Sweden continues to provide
assistance with the household budget survey and the CPI; however, the project with Sweden will end
in December 2013. An STA TA mission visited Phnom Penh in April 2012 to assist with
updating/improving the CPI. The authorities indicated a need for assistance with developing a
producer price index (PPI), but no funds have been allocated to support the compilation of an
ongoing PPI.
Government finance statistics. The Ministry of Finance and Economy began implementing reforms
to the government accounting system and budgetary nomenclature in 2007, based on the
Government Finance Statistics Manual (GFSM) 2001, with IMF TA. In addition, several STA missions
have assisted with GFS compilation procedures within the GSFM 2001 framework. IMF TA in April
2008 assisted with establishing a bridge between the government’s new chart of accounts (COA) and
the GSFM 2001 classifications so that accounting records can be used as source data in compiling
GFS. However, use and coverage of the COA has been limited and not fully integrated to activities
such as the disbursement of external loans and grants, the government’s budget reserve fund, and
capital expenditures.

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CAMBODIA

Monetary and financial statistics. The NBC compiles the balance sheet and survey for the central
bank and other depository institutions in accordance with the IMF’s Monetary and Financial Statistics
Manual. Since August 2005, the NBC has reported monthly monetary and financial statistics to STA
using the Standardized Report Forms. The NBC received TA during the FSAP on the compilation of
financial soundness indicators (FSIs). The NBC now compiles monthly core FSIs and shares them with
IMF staff irregularly. Some data inconsistencies continue to pose a challenge to the interpretation of
FSIs.
External sector statistics. Despite recent improvements, more work is needed to improve balance
of payments statistics. The NBC announced in April 2012 to make funds and resources available to
the Statistics Department for conducting three surveys, namely, on direct investment, travel, and
transport. However, compilers need to conduct sample surveys of largest direct investment
enterprises on a continuous basis to permanently close the gap for direct investment position and
transaction data. Foreign direct investment, which is believed to be large, relies excessively on
approvals, and gaps exist with respect to large build-operate-transfer projects in the energy sector.
Compilers should take full ownership and responsibility for collecting data, rather than continued
reliance on technical assistance and the use of numerous assumptions and estimations. Customs
data have substantial coverage and valuation problems arising from the use of reference prices and
limited recording of nondutiable imports, underreporting of re-exports, and weaknesses in customs
controls. The NBC receives monthly data from the General Department of Customs and Excise
(GDCE) broken down into main commodities, which it uses to generate quarterly BOP figures as well
as for internal analysis purposes. The quarterly trade figures, which are much more robust because
they include updated monthly figures, are seldom used because they are not timely available, and
presented in a different format. These figures also differ from the aggregated monthly figures, and
compilers tend to use the latter ones because they are timely and in the preferred format. The
compilers also added rather large estimates of ‘unrecorded (shuttle trade)’ and ‘non-declared
(smuggling)’ trade. Enterprise transactions, such as payment for imported services, income
payments, and portfolio investment abroad are excluded or underreported. A significant
improvement of Cambodia’s external sector statistics can be achieved if compilers strive to enhance
and increase the use of the existing International Transactions Reporting System, which can serve as
a cost-efficient and comprehensive data source to capture BOP transactions. Gaps also exist in public
external debt and official transfers (e.g., grants), and no data are available for private external debts.
Cambodia is part of the Asian module of the Project on the Improvement of External Sector Statistics
in the Asia Pacific Region, (JSA –funded), starting this year in October 2012 with a workshop in
Thailand launching the project. The project will use a modular approach for providing heightened TA
in implementing BPM6, and inviting countries to participate in the IMF’s Coordinated Direct
Investment Survey and Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey. The project will consist mainly of
short-term TA within the next three years.
Data Standards and Quality
Cambodia participates in the IMF’s General Data Dissemination System. No data ROSC are available.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS1

Approved By
David Cowen and Masato Miyazaki (IMF)
Jeffrey D. Lewis and Sudhir Shetty (IDA)

Prepared by the staffs of the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) and the International
Development Association (IDA).

This Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) shows that Cambodia’s debt distress rating remains low
under the baseline scenario. However, under an alternative scenario of limited reform progress,
the scope for absorbing risk is substantially reduced. This underscores the need for sustaining
strong growth, pursuing fiscal consolidation and mobilizing revenue, and improving debt and
contingent liability management.
1.
This DSA incorporates the following updates relative to the previous one: The
macroeconomic assumptions for the baseline scenario are broadly similar to those in last
year’s DSA, while debt-to-GDP ratio at end-2011 was slightly higher due to larger
disbursement of bilateral debt. The rating of Cambodia’s policies and institutions remains
unchanged at “medium performer,” but the discount rate is revised to 3 percent from
4 percent last year, reflecting the decline of long-term Commercial Interest Reference Rates
over the past few years.2
2.
The results show that Cambodia’s risk of debt distress remains low as debt
burden indicators under the baseline scenario do not breach their relevant thresholds. Under
an alternative scenario of a limited reform progress, however, the indicator would breach the
threshold, showing a lower scope for absorbing risks.

1

This DSA has been prepared jointly by IMF and World Bank staffs and in consultation with the Asian Development
Bank (AsDB), using the debt sustainability framework for low-income countries approved by the Boards of both
institutions.
2

Cambodia’s policies and institutions, as measured by the World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment,
continue to be classified as “medium performer.” The relevant indicative thresholds, applicable to public and publicly
guaranteed external debt, for this category are 40 percent for the net present value (NPV) of debt-to-GDP ratio,
150 percent for the NPV of debt-to-exports ratio, 250 percent for the NPV of debt-to-revenue ratio, 20 percent for the
debt service-to-exports ratio, and 30 percent for the debt service-to-revenue ratio.

CAMBODIA’S PUBLIC DEBT
3.
At end-2011, the stock of Cambodia’s external public debt, including arrears, stood at
around US$3.8 billion or 30 percent of GDP (24 percent in NPV terms). The debt-to-GDP ratio has
increased from 27 percent in 2008, partly reflecting greater external fiscal financing during the
economic slowdown in 2009 and a continuation of donor-financed development spending above
precrisis levels in 2010 and 2011.
4.
Multilateral creditors continue to hold a substantial amount of Cambodia’s external
debt. However, their share in total debt has declined from 50 percent in 2009 to 40 percent in 2011 as
a result of larger disbursement of bilateral debt during 2010–11. China remains the largest bilateral
creditor, contributing to 40 percent of the total bilateral debt stock and 80 percent of bilateral debt
disbursement during the past two years. In 1995, Cambodia concluded Paris Club agreements with
France, Germany, Italy, and Japan. However, Cambodia remains in arrears to the Russian Federation
and the United States (about 20 percent of total debt or 6 percent of GDP), and the status of
negotiations of these arrears has remained unchanged since the last DSA. Cambodia is not servicing its
debt with these two creditors, with efforts needed to conclude agreements under the Paris Club
framework. Since prospects for resolution remain unclear, this DSA assumes no debt restructuring,
with arrears continuing to build up over the projection period.
5.
Cambodia has virtually no domestic public debt. There is a small amount of bonds
(US$4 million) issued in the early 2000s and some old claims on the government (half percent of GDP,
with no interest) that were carried over from the 1990s and continue to be recorded in the monetary
survey.
6.
In early 2012, Cambodia adopted a new debt management strategy, aimed at managing
debt risks, coordinating and implementing debt management policies, and developing debt
management capacity. It also includes a DSA that considers two potential higher borrowing scenarios
in order to highlight the sustainability implications of deviating from the government’s commitment to
medium-term fiscal consolidation as outlined in the accompanying staff report. The first scenario
assumes new concessional loan disbursement of SDR 400–700 million annually during 2011–18, and as
a result, the debt distress would rise to medium risk. The second scenario assumes an annual
disbursement of SDR 400–800 million and the debt distress would further increase to high risk.3 The
results of these two scenarios are consistent with the alternative scenario in last year’s joint IMF-World
Bank DSA, which showed that larger borrowing (up to US$880 million annually, twice that under the
baseline) would lower the debt distress rating to medium risk. The authorities’ debt strategy also
emphasizes the importance of monitoring contingent liabilities, including those related to power
generation and distribution projects that are being developed under the public-private partnership
(PPP).
3

The scenarios do not assume a break in past trends of funding parameters, including degree of concessionality,
duration, currency composition and type of official lender.

MACROECONOMIC FRAMEWORK
7.
The macroeconomic framework underlying the baseline scenario remains broadly in line
with the previous DSA.


Growth and inflation: Despite the global slowdown, growth has been holding up, driven by
robust garment exports, particularly to the European Union, strong tourism activities, and a
recovering real estate sector. Real GDP is projected to grow 6½ percent in 2012, a slight
moderation from last year, but would reach its potential of about 7½ percent by 2017.4 Apart from
a gradual improvement in the global economy, this critically depends on reforms to upgrade
infrastructure and promote economic diversification, as well as enhance public sector revenue and
service delivery. Despite the recent increase in global food prices, inflation would stay at
3‒4 percent during 2012‒13. It is expected to average 3 percent over the medium term, in line
with the authorities’ informal target and partner countries’ medium-term inflation performance.

driven by robust export growth
and slower import growth after the completion of large power-generation projects. Gross official
reserves are projected to stay comfortably at more than four months of prospective imports. In
line with staffs’ recommendation of gradual medium-term fiscal consolidation, external debt
disbursement is projected to average US$500 million (2½ percent of GDP) annually during
2012‒17, mostly concessional, although the grant elements of some bilateral debts are slightly less
than 35 percent.



Fiscal sustainability: Revenue performance has improved in 2012 and the progress of fiscal
consolidation is on track, although the government fiscal buffers remain limited. Domestic revenue
is projected to increase by ½ percent of GDP annually over the medium term in line with the
authorities’ goal under the Public Financial Management Reform Program. Medium-term fiscal

consolidation is anchored by a rebuilding of government deposits and maintenance of long-term
fiscal debt sustainability, while striking a careful balance with providing resources for Cambodia’s
vast development needs against an expected gradual decline of concessional external funds.
8.
The alternative scenario assumes limited progress in structural and fiscal reforms. Slow
progress in improving the business and investment climate would reduce FDI and lower export
growth, and as a result, real GDP growth would stay flat at around 6 percent. However, the overall
impact on the current account and the balance of payment is minimal as import growth would also be
lower. At the same time, efforts at greater

to slightly more than 2½ percent of GDP
in the baseline scenario.

EXTERNAL AND PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
9.
The external DSA under the baseline macroeconomic outlook indicates that
Cambodia’s risk of debt distress remains low (Figure 1, Tables 1a and 1b). The PV of debt-to-GDP,
debt-to-exports, and debt-to-revenue ratios are expected to decline over the 20-year projection
period and remain below the respective indicative thresholds. The debt service-to-exports and debt
service-to-revenue ratios would also stay well below the thresholds throughout the projection period
partly due to the concessionality of debts. The standard stress tests also do not reveal any serious
vulnerability, although the debt-to-revenue ratio appears sensitive to exchange rate and export
shocks, highlighting the importance of raising revenue collections.
10.
The public DSA closely tracts the external debt sustainability given the small amount of
domestic public debt (Figure 2 and Tables 2a and 2b). The PV of public debt-to-GDP ratio and the
public debt service-to-revenue ratio would decline gradually over the long term, and the debt
service-to-revenue ratio would remain low in most scenarios for the entire projection period.
Consistent with the medium-term fiscal objective of building government fiscal buffers, Cambodia is
not expected to develop a market for domestic government debt securities in the foreseeable future.
11.
Public debt sustainability continues to be vulnerable to a lack of fiscal consolidation and
a permanent growth shock. If the primary balance remains unchanged at the 2012 level, the PV of
public debt-to-GDP and debt-to-revenue ratios would continue to increase, reaching about 35 percent

4

CAMBODIA

and 180 percent, respectively, in the long run. Under a permanent growth shock, if real GDP growth is
one standard deviation lower than the baseline, the ratios of public debt to GDP and revenue would
also continue to increase.
12.
Under the alternative scenario of limited reform progress, Cambodia could lose its low
debt distress rating (Figures 3 and 4 and Tables 3a and 3b). The PV of debt in terms of GDP, revenue,
and exports would increase slightly over the next decade as a result of greater disbursement of
debt to provide adequate financing for development needs. The standard tests reveal that the PV of
debt-to-revenue and debt-to-GDP ratios would breach the relevant thresholds as a result of exchange
rate shocks. Apart from reducing Cambodia’s ability to absorb shocks, the scenario underscores the
importance of mobilizing domestic revenue as planned. While the breach would seem minimal, it
should be noted that tougher financing conditions with a lower grant element, albeit difficult to
quantify ex ante, would likely ensue, which would erode debt sustainability further. Moreover, the
alternative scenario does not assume any contingent liability materializing. However, the return to
sustainable debt levels would become more difficult if the following contingent liabilities, which tend
to correlate with shocks under the bound tests, were triggered:


First, total investment of the power generation and distribution projects under PPPs is estimated at
about 50 percent of GDP, and if for any reason problems arose potentially leading to a total loss of
investment costs, substantial liabilities would be added to the debt stock.5



Second, a banking crisis that could result from a growth slowdown, for a country with Cambodia’s
financial depths could typically add about 10 percent of GDP to public debt.6

THE AUTHORITIES’ VIEW
13.
The authorities broadly agreed with the overall results of the DSA. They indicated that
they have used more conservative assumptions on economic growth and fiscal revenue in their debt
analysis to ensure prudent management and disbursement of new debt. The authorities also reiterated
that new borrowing would be prioritized for investment sectors with a high growth and social impact
(e.g., roads, bridges, ports, and irrigation), and that they would continue to monitor the concessionality
of new loans. The authorities reported that they are making progress in monitoring the contingent
liability related to power generation and distribution projects by improving information sharing
between agencies.

5

For example, if only one in ten projects fails, an average 5 percent of GDP would be added to the debt stock. Given
network externalities, one failure could trigger further failures and hamper growth, thus setting in motion a vicious cycle
of eroding debt sustainability.

6

See for example Laeven and Valencia (2010) who show that the median direct fiscal cost of banking crisis in emerging
market economies is 11.5 percent of GDP.

CONCLUSION
14.
Cambodia remains at low risk of debt distress under the baseline scenario. The baseline
projections and the standard stress tests show limited risk to external debt given that none of the
indicators breach their thresholds.
15.
However, the alternative scenario of limited reform progress shows that promoting
structural reforms and mobilizing revenue are imperative to ensure long-term debt
sustainability. This exercise also emphasizes the importance of maintaining macroeconomic stability,
managing new debt accumulation effectively, and monitoring and managing any potential contingent
liabilities arising from the power-generation projects and the financial sector.
16.
Staffs welcome progress made in adopting the new debt management strategy and
strengthening debt management capacity. The authorities should move forward to implement the
comprehensive debt management strategy and to assess and monitor the risks and potential
contingent liabilities. In this context, staffs recommend to continue improving information sharing with
a view to setting up a central monitoring unit with “gateway powers” to evaluate and approve new PPP
projects, enhancing fiscal transparency by adopting a ceiling on PPP guarantees, and listing all
contingent liabilities and government guarantees in annual budget laws.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
3/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
4/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
5/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
6/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

Sources: Cambodian authorities; and IMF staff estimates and projections.
1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), noninterest current account in percent of GDP, and nondebt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after
the shock (implicitly assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
January 8, 2013

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation with
Cambodia
On December 3, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Cambodia. 1
Background
Despite the global slowdown, Cambodia’s economy has been holding up, driven by resilient
exports and tourism, and a strong real estate recovery. Although moderating, exports continued
to grow at double digit during the first three quarters of the year, in part thanks to improved
access of garments exports to the European Union. Tourism has been particularly robust
benefitting from new flight routes and construction activity is picking up owing to the real
estate rebound. Real GDP growth is projected at 6½ percent in 2012, a slight moderation from
last year. Headline inflation has decelerated and is expected to average 3–4 percent in
2012‒13 amid stable domestic food prices. Private sector credit continued to grow at more than
30 percent (year-on-year) during the first eight months on the back of broad-based credit
demand and easy financial conditions.
The current account deficit (including official transfers) is projected to peak at 10 percent of
GDP in 2012, reflecting moderating exports and temporarily higher imports related to large
infrastructure projects, but the deficit remains fully financed by large foreign direct investment

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:

and official loans. Gross official reserves have continued their steady rise to US$3.4 billion in
September, about four months of prospective imports.
Over the medium term, economic growth is projected to reach the potential of about
7½ percent, but this depends on improvements in the global economy and continued reforms to
upgrade infrastructure, promote economic diversification, and enhance public sector revenue
and service delivery. The current account deficit would narrow to 5½ percent of GDP, broadly in
line with estimates of Cambodia’s savings-investment norm, driven by robust export growth,
improved competitiveness and diversification, and lower imports after the completion of large
projects.
This outlook is subject to considerable risks, stemming from the fragility of the global economy
and domestic factors, including potential labor market instabilities and extreme weather.
Spillovers from a deepening euro area crisis and severe global financial turbulence could be
significant, but the impact has so far been relatively contained. Should any of these downside
risks materialize, the policy space to cushion their impact would be limited. A high degree of
dollarization constrains the effectiveness of monetary policy, leaving fiscal policy as the main
tool to preserve macroeconomic stability. The slow pace of fiscal consolidation during the past
two years means that the fiscal buffers are limited and the room for policy maneuver remains
severely curtailed.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended Cambodia’s resilient economic performance and the
authorities’ prudent policies. They agreed that the outlook is favorable but stressed the
importance of rebuilding policy buffers to guard against risks, including from external spillovers
and high domestic credit growth. Over the medium term, further efforts are needed to diversify
the economy and achieve stronger, broad-based growth.
Directors welcomed the recent improvements in revenue collection and the plan to begin
replenishing government deposits in the 2013 budget. They emphasized that greater revenue
mobilization is required to meet Cambodia’s large development needs and achieve long-term
fiscal sustainability. They recommended an integrated approach of improving revenue
administration, implementing fair and efficient tax policies, and strengthening governance.
More broadly, Directors encouraged continued efforts in strengthening public financial
management. This will help improve public service delivery and ensure greater spending
effectiveness and budget transparency. They also stressed the importance of strengthening the
monitoring of contingent fiscal liabilities.
Directors noted that the high degree of dollarization limits the central bank’s control over
monetary conditions. While the recent increase in the reserve requirement for foreign currency

3
deposits is welcome, they considered that further gradual increases may be needed to guard
against excessive risk-taking by banks. These could be complemented by appropriately
designed macroprudential measures. Directors looked forward to the introduction of negotiable
certificates of deposits to help develop an interbank market, which is key to more effective and
market-based monetary policy operations.
Directors emphasized the need to continue to make progress in implementing key 2010 FSAP
recommendations. They noted the authorities’ firm commitment to strengthening the central
bank’s supervisory capacity and urged more decisive action in establishing an adequate and
well-coordinated system of financial supervision. They looked forward to progress in adopting
memoranda of understanding between supervisory agencies on information exchange and
crisis resolution. They welcomed the authorities’ more prudent approach toward issuing new
bank licenses.
Directors encouraged the authorities to continue their efforts to broaden the economic base and
promote inclusive growth. They agreed that reducing infrastructure and skills bottlenecks,
improving the investment climate, and promoting rural development remain important policy
priorities.

Statement by Der Jiun Chia, Executive Director for Cambodia
and Sovannarith Kith, Advisor to Executive Director
December 3, 2012
On behalf of our Cambodian authorities, we would like to thank the IMF Article IV
Consultation team for a set of focused recommendations. Our authorities appreciated the
constructive discussion around the need to build fiscal policy buffers, strengthen monetary
policy instruments and transmission, improve supervision, and create a more self-sustaining
economic growth. Generally, our authorities are in broad agreement with the thrust of the
staff’s appraisal and would give it due consideration when formulating policies.
Recent development and economic outlook
The UN’s assessment suggests that Cambodia is one of the top five countries that have made
significant progress toward meeting its MDGs by 2015. The poverty rate has dropped
dramatically from 47.50 percent in 1993-94 to 34.70 percent in 2004 and to 23.00 percent in
2011, due to ongoing reforms that promote inclusive growth and employment creation. The
recently published Doing Business 2013 also shows an improvement in the business climate
as Cambodia moves to rank number 133 in 2013, up from 141 in 2012. Reasons cited include
easier access to credit for investors, better credit information with the creation of the
Cambodia Credit Bureau, and better enforcement of contract.
The Cambodian economy has been recovering strongly from the global crisis, with growth
averaging around 6.7 percent per year from 2010 to 2012, underpinned by exports and
tourism growth and a strong recovery in the construction sector. The authorities expect the
economy to continue to grow at close to its medium-term potential of 7.5 percent.
Despite the recent surge in global food and fuel prices, headline inflation has moderated to
2.2 percent in August 2012 from an average of 4.5 percent in 2011, and is expected to
average around 3-4 percent during 2012-13. Over the medium-term, the headline inflation is
projected to average around 3 percent.
The external position has remained stable despite a marginal widening of the deficit in the
current account deficit (including official transfers) to accommodate a large increase in
foreign direct investment funded imports related to power generation and infrastructure
projects. The real effective exchange rate remains relatively stable while the level of foreign
reserves has gradually increased to more than four months of prospective imports. In addition,
the Debt Sustainability Analysis indicates that Cambodia’s debt distress rating remains low.
Our authorities are committed to maintain external debt at around 20 to 40 percent of GDP
and only borrow on concessional terms for investments in macro-critical projects, as
reflected in the recently approved 2011-2018 Public Debt Management Strategy.1
Notwithstanding the favorable outlook, infrastructure bottlenecks and less favorable business
climate have been restraining private investment, which is the essential to release potential

growth.2 Externally, the lingering debt crisis in Europe and the sluggish growth in the U. S.
economy continue to affect the Cambodian garment exports, which mainly go to Europe and
the U.S. The moderation of growth momentum in the Asia region would also weigh on
growth prospect.
Going forward, our authorities are fully committed to implement prudent policies to reduce
the fiscal deficit to a more sustainable level of around 3 percent of GDP, and restore
government deposits in the banking system to the pre-crisis level. Public investment would
be prioritized to remove infrastructure bottlenecks which would help lift the investment rate
and promote economic diversification. Structural reforms would also be continued and would
be targeted at improving the business environment and fostering inclusive growth.
Fiscal policy
The implementation of the 2012 Budget Law has been strong with the fiscal deficit projected
to drop from 8.16 percent of GDP in 2011 to 5.79 percent of GDP in 2012, due to a
3.20 percent increase in revenue collection and a 1.86 percent decrease in expenditures.
Furthermore, the draft 2013 Budget Law3 envisages an increase in government deposits in
the banking system by Riel 100 billion and a reduction in the fiscal deficit from 5.79 percent
of GDP in 2012 to 5.60 percent of GDP in 2013 through further raising of revenue collection
and rationalizing of expenditures. Our authorities are determined to prioritise expenditures
and keep current spending under control, including by limiting the wage bill to around
4 percent of GDP, while strengthening revenue mobilization.
Despite the improvement in revenue collection, the Public Financial Management Reform
Program targeted a 0.50 percentage point of GDP increase in revenue collection annually to
accommodate additional priority spending. In this regard, a comprehensive revenue
mobilization strategy is being drafted based on the integrated three-pronged approach
recommended by Fund staff, namely to improve revenue administration, implement fair and
efficient tax policies, and strengthen governance. The implementation of this strategy will
start with easily implementable and low cost measures. Further efforts will focus on
strengthening the capacity of tax collectors and auditors.
While mindful of the fiscal risk from the contingent liabilities related to the development of
power generation and transmission projects, our authorities view that these projects are
critical in reducing the high cost of electricity, which would in turn have a beneficial effect
on investment and potential growth. The viability of these projects are also underpinned by
strong demand for electricity as only about 35 percent of households have access to reliable
electricity. In addition, sub-decrees were issued to implement the 2011-2018 Public Debt
Management Strategy including the policy and risk management framework for government
2

During 2011 Article IV Consultation, staff simulation based on the macro-model suggested that a 10 percent
increase in investment, which currently stands at 20 percent of GDP, can raise potential growth immediately by
as much as 2 percent and the positive growth effect can persist even after a decade.

National Assembly for upcoming discussion.

guarantee, which are being drafted with Technical Assistance from the Asian Development
Bank. The Strategy is aimed at strengthening the management of contingent liabilities.
Monetary policy
The National Bank of Cambodia (NBC) has also adopted a stricter policy on bank licensing,
which strikes a balance between allowing competition to work in the banking market and
avoiding excessive and destabilizing competition. Commercial banks and microfinance
institutions are well-capitalized. To improve risk management in the industry, the NBC
helped to create the Cambodia Credit Bureau to provide the platform to share both positive
and negative credit information.
Our authorities continue to have a dedollarization objective, and are studying policy options
to promote the greater use of the Riel.
Addressing macrofinancial risk
The NBC is closely monitoring for incipient signs of risk stemming from rapid credit growth
and has recently increased the reserve requirement for foreign currency deposits by 50 basis
points to provide a cautionary signal to the banks. The NBC continues to monitor the effect
of the rise on credit growth and is considering taking further measures including a range of
complementary marcoprudential tools.
Nevertheless our authorities pointed out that credit growth has been broad-based and comes
from a small base. Credit growth does not appear to be out of line with the vast development
needs in Cambodia nor with the need to diversify the economic base. In addition, domestic
deposits have mainly funded the credit growth, and non-performing loans are stable at
2.51 percent. Credit quality has been good and banks are generally prudent and maintain high
lending standards.
Developing an interbank market
In line with the recently updated 2011-2020 Financial Sector Development Strategy, the
NBC has been working closely with Bankers’ Association on the introduction of negotiable
certificate of deposits (NCDs) evidencing commercial banks’ surplus deposits with the
central bank to develop an interbank market and strengthen monetary policy operation. In
this regard, the NBC would appreciate further TA from the Fund to ensure the success of
launching NCDs and support policy credibility.
Strengthening supervision capacity
The NBC has also taken concrete steps to strengthen supervision. Bank supervision is
moving from a compliance-based approach to a risk-based and forward looking approach.
The quality of supervision has improved considerably, underpinned by the hiring of new
supervisors and the ongoing internal and external training. In addition, supervisors are now
more focused on the specialized tasks. New recruits often come in with financial sector or

4
audit experience, which improves the skills and experience profile of supervisors at the NBC.
The NBC remains firmly committed to strengthen its supervisory capacity through
recruitment and training.
Continuing reform agenda
Structural reforms on various fronts will help remove bottlenecks, improve business
environment and foster inclusive growth. A total of 1,015 megawatt of electricity generation
capacity would be added in 2012/13 from the operation of six different hydropower projects.
This would provide affordable electricity to the population and increase export growth
especially in the manufacturing and garment sectors. The implementation of the Rice Policy
together with ongoing public investment on road, bridges and irrigation has helped to
promote rural development and inclusive growth. Recent efforts to provide land titles to
people in rural areas will enable them to use their land as collateral to obtain financing. Our
authorities actively engage with the private sector to foster a conducive business climate and
promote a private sector led-growth. In this regard, the Prime Minister chairs the semi-annual
Government-Private Sector Forum to dialogue with the business community on investmentrelated issues, including draft policies and regulations.
Closing remarks
The Cambodian economy continues to perform well in 2012, supported by the robust export
and tourism growth, and a rebound in construction activity. While the medium-term outlook
is favorable, more needs to be done to ensure the achievement of MDGs by 2015 and the
improvement the standard of living of the people. Lingering global uncertainty and a spike in
global food and fuel prices could also pose downside risks to growth prospect. Going
forward, our authorities are committed to implement sound and prudent policies to preserve
macroeconomic stability, generate high sustainable growth, and maintain a sound and stable
financial system. Structural reforms are aimed at removing infrastructure bottlenecks,
improving the business climate, and fostering economic diversification. Our authorities also
appreciate the high quality of Technical Assistance provided by the Fund in various areas.
Continuation of the Technical Assistance would help to ensure the success of the reform
agenda.
