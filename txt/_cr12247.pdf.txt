STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
July 16, 2012

KEY ISSUES
Context: South Africa faces the immediate challenge of conducting policy under a highly
uncertain global environment and making firm progress on reforms that promote the
long-run inclusive growth needed for maintaining social cohesion.
Growth prospects: Reflecting the global slowdown, growth is likely to fall below 3 percent
in 2012, and gradually recover ground to close the negative output gap, now two years
later than envisaged.
Policy mix: The policy discussions centered on monetary and fiscal policies under the
baseline and the proper policy mix under a severe adverse scenario. Staff supported the
monetary and fiscal policy stances and emphasized the need for rebalancing the
composition of spending away from the wage bill and toward capital spending and, in the
medium term, rebuilding fiscal buffers. In the adverse scenario, authorities agreed that
monetary policy should provide most of the stimulus given the more limited fiscal space.
Structural reforms: Labor and product market reforms are key to reduce high structural
unemployment, improve external competitiveness, and foster inclusive growth.
Financial stability: Banks’ capital and liquidity cushions have stabilized at comfortable
levels, and credit growth and bank profitability have started to pick up from a low base. The
main risks remain banks’ dependence on domestic short-term wholesale funding and their
heavy exposure to home mortgages. Broad regulatory reforms to further enhance financial
sector resiliency are under way.
External vulnerability: Although vulnerabilities are on the low side, risks have increased.
Public and external debts are moderate and largely denominated in domestic currency.
Rand flexibility and international reserve coverage provide buffers against external risks.

External sources of risk include

slower demand for South African exports
and a further decline in commodity prices.
Although the euro area remains the main
regional trading partner, South Africa has
been able to diversify its export markets
through a significant increase in exports to
China, and sub-Saharan Africa. Nevertheless,
since the euro area and China are global
players, disruption in one economy will likely
have significant spillovers on the other and
the rest of the world. Although the direct
share of China is smaller than that of the euro
area, it will likely have a strong indirect effect
through its impact on commodity prices and
other sub-Saharan African economies
(Appendix I).
13.

Adverse developments in one of

these economies would be particularly
damaging if it also gave rise to a sharp
increase in risk aversion. Capital outflows,
such as those arising from a global
reassessment of the riskiness of emerging
markets in general or South Africa in
particular, could also force a sharp adjustment
in fiscal spending and import levels. Large
portfolio flows have helped fund the
significant external current account and fiscal
deficits although in 2011 foreign direct
investment played a significant role. The
impact on GDP of capital outflows would
depend on the net effect of higher risk
sensitivity, currency depreciation, and interest
rates. The flexible exchange rate regime helps
share the adjustment cost with foreign

investors holding the mainly randdenominated public debt.
14.

Domestic sources of risk include

increased labor unrest in a politically
important year. In December 2012, the ANC,
the party in power since 1994 and in a
tripartite alliance with one of the main labor
unions and the communist party, chooses its
presidential candidate. Impatience with the
high structural unemployment, particularly of
the young, could lead to inappropriate
responses that might threaten
macroeconomic stability. In addition, adverse
external developments and domestic shocks
could increase further unacceptably high
levels of unemployment.
15.

On the positive side, a resolution of

the uncertainty in Europe could give rise to
an unexpectedly sharp expansion in
demand on a global scale. This would foster
demand for South African exports and would
likely give rise to an increase in commodity
prices. The prevailing low levels of risk
aversion under low global interest rates could
result in large flows to emerging markets.
Under this environment, South Africa may find
it easier to implement its ambitious public
investment program and this may result in
high growth rates. On the other hand, the
inflows and repricing of risk would likely lead
to strong rand appreciation.

Staff welcomes the renewed drive

for building public infrastructure.
Investment in infrastructure has been held
back largely due to limited implementation
capacity. The resulting bottlenecks in electricity
generation, transport, and port infrastructure
means South Africa has not benefited as much
as other resource intensive emerging market
economies from its large terms of trade gains
of the last decade. This in turn has discouraged
investment in South Africa’s natural resource
industry, and some key exports have seen
substantial volume declines despite high
commodity prices. Public enterprises increased
their fixed capital formation in the late 2000s
and owing to gestation periods a new large
power plant will start partial operations only in
2013. In 2012, a presidential commission
identified key infrastructure projects to be

25.

Large-scale projects, such as those

identified by the presidential infrastructure
coordinating commission, need to be
subject to rigorous but prompt assessment
and prioritized to maximize long-term
benefits. To contain fiscal risks, tariffs and user
fees should reflect service and investment
costs while ensuring efficiency in running these
enterprises, which often have a dominant
market position. Options to involve the private
sector in network industries dominated by
state-owned enterprises need to be explored.
26.

Staff supports the government’s

intent to introduce a National Health
Insurance (NHI) scheme and social security
and retirement reforms. The NHI reform
rightly aims to improve access to public health
services, while improving its quality and
coverage (Box 1). Staff endorses the
authorities’ gradual and cautious
implementation, and stresses that careful
attention should be given to design issues,
which determine incentives and ultimately the
cost of the programs. Although financing
options are still under debate, the chosen
financing package should keep the fiscal
consolidation plan intact and preserve fiscal
sustainability.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

SOUTH AFRICA

Box 1. Toward a National Health Insurance System in South Africa
South Africa has one of the largest disease burdens and lowest life expectancies among emerging
markets, yet access to health care services is low for a large share of its population. In 2011, the
government made the political decision to extend access to health care services to the population as
a whole by implementing over time a National Health Insurance (NHI) scheme. Although the details
are still being fleshed out, the approach is to pool the risks and the funds so that equity and social
solidarity will be achieved through the creation of a single NHI fund.
The NHI is planned to be implemented gradually over 14 years in three phases. The first phase
(2011–15) mainly includes organizational changes to build capacity and pilots projects to assess the
preliminary design. In the second and third phases (2016–2020 and 2020–24), the NHI will
progressively take over the administration for the health functions.
The cost of the NHI is difficult to predict given the large uncertainties regarding the “utilization”
levels of the insured population, the disease burden, some possible changes in the coverage of the
medical benefits package, and the price evolution of the health care services. Preliminary estimates
from the National Treasury suggest that public health spending could increase by 2 percentage
points of GDP to reach 6.2 percent of GDP in 2025. This would require new sources of financing, and
the authorities are considering various options, including a payroll tax (payable by both employees
and employers), a higher value-added tax rate, a surcharge on taxable income, or some combination
of these. In choosing among the funding options, care should be taken not to further increase labor
costs that could have an adverse effect on employment.
But beyond the need to identify the financing measures, the authorities acknowledge the need to
contain public health spending and maintain fiscal sustainability. Lessons from other countries
suggest that this would require both macrolevel instruments (such as budget caps and central
oversight) and microlevel measures to improve the efficiency of spending. Strengthening market
mechanisms, among other things by allowing more competition between health service providers
and insurers, and relying on a greater degree of private provision, as well as increasing the level of
cost-sharing have been successful in containing spending growth.

Although South Africa has the most

institutions in G20 countries identified areas
for further improvement, including external
scrutiny of the treasury’s macroeconomic
assumptions and forecast and independent
evaluation of fiscal policies, beyond the current
activities of South Africa’s fiscal commission.
There was also scope for more systematic

exchange rates. The rand responds rapidly to
changes in the VIX, whose surges give rise to
shifts away from risky assets and activities
(Figure 7).
34.

Despite recent rand depreciation,

various indicators point to enduring
problems with external competitiveness.
High wage bargains have contributed to high
domestic costs of production, including high
unit labor costs. Export volumes remain below
their historically high precrisis levels and have
continued to recover more slowly than partner
demand, although in part they reflect a
substantial decline in gold production. South
Africa’s market share in global export markets
has increased modestly since the mid-2000s, in
contrast to rapid gains by other emerging
markets and commodity producers.
Competitiveness problems could intensify if
easy external financing conditions lead to a
resumption of capital inflows to emerging
markets (Figure 8).6

Source: South African Central Bank.

35.

Model-based estimates suggest the

rand was overvalued in real effective terms
by 5–15 percent in March 2012 (Box 2).
These models aim to control for changes in
fundamentals, including fiscal variables. Low
structural savings and substantial investment
needs justify large current account deficits but
may also require significant real rand
depreciation over the medium term to help
service the increasing foreign liabilities, even if
largely rand denominated.
Authorities’ Views
36.

The authorities agreed that South

African firms faced high domestic costs of
production, which negatively affected their
external competitiveness. They also
acknowledged that low domestic savings
requires relying on foreign savings for
investment needs. Their models also led them
to believe that the rand is somewhat
overvalued, but that the precise magnitude
was difficult to pin down given the high

Box 2. South Africa: External Sector Assessment
External sector risks are relatively contained. South Africa’s exchange rate regime is one of the
most flexible among emerging markets. The net IIP position at -18 percent of GDP in 2010 is not seen
as a major source of risk. Both external debt and the net international investment position are
moderate, with a large share of liabilities either in equity and/or denominated in rand. Although
portfolio flows have increased, the associated risks they pose are mitigated by the free-floating
exchange rate. Reserves are currently adequate according to the IMF metric. In the current
environment, the quality of portfolio investments abroad of the nonbank private sector, of about
30 percent of GDP in 2010, is a possible source of vulnerability.
However, competitiveness and the elevated level

To disentangle the relative effects of these two forces on the external assessment, we start by
assessing the underlying level of the current account deficit. This involves adjusting the realized
level of the current account balance to strip out temporary factors such as output gaps in both South
Africa and its trading partners. As a proxy for this, we take our medium-term projection of the current
account (a deficit of 5.9 percent of GDP) in 2017, by which time all such transitory factors should have
dissipated. The substantial widening expected in the deficit expected over the medium term reflects in
large part: (i) the transitory nature of recent terms of trade gains, (ii) higher expected deficits on net
income once interest rates normalize, (iii) and transfers to other countries in the South African
Customs Union (SACU). More fundamentally, they reflect South Africa’s low saving rates for its large
investment needs.
Application of a range of techniques, including two based on our estimate of the underlying
current account, suggests that real exchange rate remained misaligned in the first quarter of
2012. In particular, CGER approach suggests misalignment of 13 percent in February-March, while
preliminary estimates based on the IMF’s pilot external balance assessment (EBA) approach imply that
the current account deficit in 2011 was 2.5 percent of GDP higher than predicted, which is consistent
with misalignment of 11 percent. Taking into account forecast uncertainty, staff assess that the real
exchange rate was misaligned by 5-15 percent during this period.
The CGER methodology is based on an average of three complementary methods:
・ The first of these approaches, macro-balance, compares the underlying current account with a
current account norm (at minus 3 percent of GDP), implying that the underlying current account
deviates from the level implied by medium-term fundamentals by around 3 percent of GDP,
which is consistent with misalignment of around 17 percent.

Box 2. South Africa: External Sector Assessment (concluded)
・ The External Sustainability (ES) approach compares the underlying current account with a level
that would stabilize South Africa’s external liabilities around the average for all emerging markets
(34 percent of GDP).1 This approach implies an even larger degree of misalignment, slightly
exceeding 20 percent.
・ Finally, the equilibrium exchange rate approach implies that the real exchange rate is fairly valued.
The application of this approach to South Africa is complicated by the extent of structural change
after the fall of Apartheid, and the need to assume that the exchange rate is in equilibrium on
average over the sample period.

・ Other structural indicators, while more backward looking in nature, broadly support the
conclusion of a chronic but moderate competitiveness problem. South Africa’s share of global
export markets has expanded since the mid-2000s, but less rapidly than that of most large EMs.
Export performance has remained weak in volume terms, with export volumes growing at a slower
pace than import demand in trading partners, whereas most EMs have seen faster volume growth
than trading partner demand during the same period.

As in past Article IVs, the external sustainability for South Africa is based on the EM average for the net
international investment, as the current level seems low for its development needs.

In the short run, employment can

also be supported through active labor
market policy (ALMP) measures. These could
include temporary youth wage subsidies,
transport subsidies for job seekers, and other
schemes to provide working experience and
on-the-job training. Staff noted such schemes
should be carefully designed to prevent abuse
and create net employment, with spending in
this area tightly controlled given the fiscal cost
of such schemes. Temporary public work
programs could also provide an important
safety net for the unemployed, would be selfselecting if wages are kept low, and would not
permanently increase the public wage bill.9
Staff argued, however, that the recent increase
in public sector employment is not a cost
effective or efficient way to increase
employment. It may crowd out critical health
and education spending and tend to put
upward pressure on wages in the economy,
thereby limiting the impact on aggregate
employment.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Authorities’ Views
46.

The authorities emphasized the

need for product market reforms to
complement those of the labor market.
They felt that greater emphasis should be
placed on the former, and cautioned that the
political economy of South Africa makes it
difficult to carry out radical labor market
reforms, given the historically difficult hardwon rights of the labor movement. The largest
umbrella labor union, Congress of South
African Trade Unions (COSATU), emphasized
three main points. First, greater emphasis
should be given to temporary public works
programs. Second, in its present form, the
youth wage subsidy would not lead to a net
increase in permanent employment. Third, the
current labor protection laws does allow for
SMEs to be exempted from certain collective
bargaining agreements. With regard to the last
point, the authorities clarified that this was, in
practice, very difficult to achieve.

9

According to the Budget Review, the governments’
existing ALMP programs include training courses and
apprenticeships to enhance skills, 125 labor centers
offering job-search and job-matching services, public
work programs that provide short-term jobs to the
unemployed, a Jobs Fund to support projects with the
potential to create a large number of jobs, and training
layoff schemes to subsidize the temporary suspension
of work in favor of training. Government spending on
public work programs has increased from R4.2 billion
(0.6 percent of consolidated government expenditure)
in 2008/09 to R7.8 billion (0.8 percent of expenditure)
in 2011/12.

Table 1. Authorities’ Response to Past IMF Policy Recommendations
(Scale―fully consistent, broadly consistent, marginally consistent, or inconsistent)

IMF 2011 Article IV Recommendations

Authorities’ Response

Fiscal policy
Tighten fiscal stance over the medium term.
Rebalance the composition of public spending
Limit annual (primary) real spending growth to around
2 percent.
Wage moderation in the public sector.

Broadly consistent
The 2012 Budget calls for rebalancing public spending and
wage moderation. The implicit real annual primary spending
growth is 2.7 percent over the 3-year budget horizon. However,
in 2011, the wage bill exceeded budgeted levels and capital
spending allocations remained unfulfilled. Growth in real public
wages did moderate due to higher inflation.

Public enterprises
Expand electricity capacity in a timely fashion.

Fully consistent
Eskom is planning to ramp up its investment plan. In 2013 will
start partial operations one of the two power plants that will
increase installed capacity by [20] percent by 2018.
Fully consistent
The policy rate was kept unchanged while inflation expectations
remained within the target band.

Monetary policy
Given high uncertainty to the outlook, delay the start of
tightening monetary policy.
Reserve policy
Increase reserve buildup in the near term.
Capital flow management
Keep exchange rate flexibility and continued building reserves in
the near term, and gradually recalibrate the fiscal-monetary
policy mix over the medium term.
Labor reforms
Increase labor and wage flexibility.
Endow the wage bargaining framework with sufficient flexibility
to exempt smaller firms and reduce unnecessary regulatory
burdens facing firms.

Product market regulation
Remove burden of regulation and barriers to entry in key
network industries.

Financial sector policy
Continue progress in adopting FSAP recommendations,
adopting Basel III initiatives, and setting the institutional and
regulatory infrastructure for the twin-peaks system.

38

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Marginally consistent
Reserves have fluctuated around a relatively stable level, partly
reflecting valuation changes.
Broadly consistent
South Africa has one of the most flexible exchange rate regimes
in emerging markets. No capital inflow management measures
have been added to the toolkit.
Inconsistent
Labor regulations in South Africa play an important role in
protecting worker rights, but may also impose rigidities and
contribute to unemployment. Amendments to the labor laws
brought to the attention of Parliament would constrain the role
of labor brokers, which had given some flexibility to the labor
market and accounted for a substantial increase in employment
during 2005-2008.
Broadly Consistent
The new Companies Act makes it easier to start, sell, or close a
business. The development of standards has enabled growth in
new sectors. Tax thresholds to firms have been increased to
encourage small businesses.
Fully consistent
Significant overhaul in laws and regulations to reach the
objectives.

Table 2. South Africa: Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM)1
Source of Risks
1. Strong intensification of the euro
area crisis

2. Sharp slowdown in China

3. Idiosyncratic adverse terms of
trade shock resulting from lower
non-oil commodity prices or a sharp
increase in oil prices.

Relative Likelihood

Impact if Realized

Medium

Medium to High
Such intensification would have global effects,
including lower world growth, falling commodity
prices, and higher risk aversion that leads to
capital outflows and volatility. It would directly
affect about ¼th of South African exports,
especially of manufactured goods. The indirect
effect depends on associated decline in
commodity prices and increase in global risk
aversion, which would affect confidence and
domestic demand.
Medium to High
A slowdown in China would reduce global
commodity prices. It will directly affect about
12 percent of South African exports. Indirectly it
would likely affect South Africa’s exports to subSaharan Africa (about 15 percent of exports),
which depends heavily on commodity prices. Low
commodity prices would lower domestic income
and demand.
Medium
Adverse terms of trade would have adverse
income effects on domestic demand and may on
the margin reduce mineral exports. A sharp rise in
oil prices would also increase headline inflation
and could have second round effects on core
inflation. Geopolitical tensions could affect South
Africa’s cost of refining, which depends heavily on
Iranian oil.
Medium
Home mortgages account for a significant share
of banks’ loan portfolio, and a sharp drop may
increase bank nonperforming loans, hurt
profitability, and erode their capital base.
Low to Medium
Large inflows would ensure low interest funding
of the current account and fiscal deficits, but the
resulting real appreciation may affect growth, if
not accompanied by booming economic activity
abroad.
Low
A possible downgrade has already been priced in,
and partly offset by the inclusion of South Africa
in Citi’s emerging market index.
Low
As currently defined, the BIS’s net stable funding
ratio may require South African banks to replace
their domestic wholesale funding with more
expensive funding, to increase their liquidity, or
to deleverage. These may affect bank profitability
and hurt credit growth.

Low

Medium
Slowdown in economic activity may
lead to lower commodity prices.
Low
Oil prices may increase beyond cyclical
levels for geopolitical considerations.

5. Large capital inflows

SOUTH AFRICA

Appendix I. South Africa: Inward and Outward Spillovers
South Africa is a prime candidate for studying spillovers. The largest sub-Saharan African (SSA) economy,
accounting for over a third of SSA’s GDP and about 40 percent of its exports, has strong financial and trade
links to the global economy and other SSA countries. It is subject to inward spillovers from shocks to advanced
economies and other emerging markets through financial and real sector channels (Canales-Kriljenko, 2011).
South Africa has one of the most liquid bond and equity markets among emerging market economies and
shocks to global financial conditions rapidly filter into South African domestic financial variables. South African
GDP is closely correlated to world GDP, a correlation that has increased over the last few decades. Through
trade and financial channels, it could in principle also retransmit some of those shocks to other SSA countries,
giving rise to outward spillovers. Arguably, the scope for spillovers within the region has increased with the
expansion of intraregional trade over the last decade. South Africa has also expanded its foreign direct
investment in the region over the last decade, and South African banks are key players in many countries in the
region, although cross-border flows are limited because their subsidiaries essentially manage local deposits.
South Africa is significantly exposed to adverse developments in Europe and China. Adverse
developments in one would affect the other and, ultimately, world growth. A slowdown in China could have
the additional impact of likely giving rise to a sharper reduction in commodity prices. Such a slowdown would
also have an indirect effect on South Africa through its SSA trading partners, which heavily depend on
commodity prices. Model simulations suggest that shocks to any of these countries would have a more
deleterious effect on South Africa if they also lead to a sharp increase in global risk aversion, which tends to
lower business and consumer confidence not only in South Africa, but also in other trading partners (MeyerCirkel and Canales-Kriljenko, forthcoming).
Adverse developments in Europe and China would hurt the Southern Africa Customs Union (SACU)
members both directly and through spillovers from South Africa. The resulting slowdown in world growth
and commodity prices would reduce SACU member’s income and external demand, but the impact via South
Africa of the crisis would be more likely felt in the smaller countries that trade more with South Africa. South
Africa accounts for about 80 percent of exports and an even higher share of imports of Lesotho and Swaziland.
Customs revenues heavily depend on South African imports and account for a substantial amount of fiscal
revenue in most SACU countries. The formula for sharing custom revenues provides members in the region
about two years to adjust their policies in response to the decline in customs revenues associated with a
decline in global trade. It exposes the members’ fiscal revenue to rand volatility. In addition, most SACU
members, except Botswana, peg their currencies to the South African rand, in practice, adopting monetary
policy decisions from the South African Reserve Bank. Anecdotal evidence suggests that remittances from
South Africa to some SACU members may also be significant. Moreover, South African financial groups are the
dominant players in the financial markets of the region, spanning banking, pension, insurance, and wealth
management services, whose treasury and risk management decisions tend to be centralized in Johannesburg.
These institutions may help channel the substantial foreign direct investment from South Africa into the rest of
the region. Despite all spillovers on different dimensions, output correlation among SACU members is low and
South African GDP does not enter into a panel explaining GDP fluctuations in the region after controlling for
world variables and fiscal policies (Canales-Kriljenko, Gwenhamo, and Thomas, forthcoming).
Other countries with strong trade and investment links to South Africa that would suffer from outward
spillovers include Congo Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.

Appendix II. Estimating the Implicit Inflation Target1

South Africa adopted inflation targeting (IT) as a formal framework for monetary policy in 2000, with an
inflation target band of between 3 and 6 percent. The adoption of the IT framework has clearly
strengthened the South African Reserve Bank’s (SARB’s) mandate to focus on price stability and increased
the SARB’s accountability toward its main objective.

the implicit inflation target varied over time, and in recent

inflation to better support economic activity in the face of an extremely challenging global environment.

Appendix III. South Africa: Real Wage, Labor Productivity, and Employment1
The recent financial crisis hit South Africa’s labor market severely. In 2009–10, South Africa lost about
three-quarters of a million jobs—equivalent to about 5 percent of total employment at end-2008, and
unemployment, which already hovered above 20 percent during the precrisis period, increased further to
about 25 percent. In 2011, this trend was partially reversed; however job creation continued to be rather
weak and insufficient to make a substantial dent in unemployment.
The massive employment loss in 2009–10 and the relatively weak job creation in 2011 may reflect several
factors, including the weak employment protection of the large share of informal workers and the
sluggish recovery in South Africa’s traditional trading

The analysis also examines the link between real wage growth and labor productivity growth from an
international perspective. It confirms that labor productivity growth has, on average, a positive and
significant impact on real wage growth; however, in South Africa, the link between the two is substantially
weaker than in other emerging markets, even after controlling for labor market tightness indicators such
as unemployment and labor absorption rate.

Appendix IV. A Financial Conditions Index for South Africa1
Financial conditions are known to have an important influence on business cycles because they reflect not only the
feedback of current and past economic conditions but also the markets’ expectations about the economic outlook.
The construction of financial conditions indices (FCIs) has become critical not only to better understand the
macrofinancial linkages, but also to obtain some indications about the direction of the near-term economic activity.
Although there is wide range of methodologies to construct a financial conditions index, the application for South
Africa involves two alternative approaches: a principal component analysis (PCA), which uses the methodology
2
proposed by Hatzius and others (2010), and a Kalman filter, which allows for a smoother, auto-correlated statistical
process. Both approaches aim to identify an unobservable common factor from a group of global financial indicators
(the global risk aversion, the TED spread, S&P500 index, the emerging market bond index), as well as South Africarelated financial variables (sovereign spread, credit to the private sector, non-performing loans, the rate of
negotiated certificates of deposits, JSE index, house prices, NEER).
The estimated FCIs were found to have predictive
power for near-term GDP growth (up to 4
quarters), pointing to strong macro-financial
linkages in the economy. And indeed, the
economic boom in 2005–08, the contraction in
economic activity in 2009 and the recovery in
2010–11 are well captured by the FCIs’
trajectories (Figure 1).
In recent months, however, there has been some
deterioration, on the back of the elevated stress
triggered by the sovereign and banking crisis in
the euro area. Based on the historical link
between FCIs and GDP growth, this may suggest
economic activity is likely to moderate in the
period ahead.

Box 1. Liberalization of Capital Controls on Residents
October 2009 – The authorities (i) raised the lifetime limit on individuals investment offshore to R4 million from
R2 million a year and (ii) increased the single discretionary allowance to R750,000 from R500,000.
March 2010 – Authorised dealers were allowed to acquire direct and indirect foreign exposure up to a
macroprudential limit of 25 percent of their total liabilities, excluding total shareholder's equity.
October 2010 – Authorities (i) eliminated the 10 percent levy on the capital South Africans can transfer upon
emigration, (ii) raised the limit on offshore investments by individuals to R4 million a year from R4 million in a
lifetime, and (iii) raised the single discretionary allowance to R1 million from R750,000.
December 2010 – Limits that resident institutional investors can invest offshore were raised by 5 percentage
points, and now range from 25 to 35 percent depending on the type of institutional investor.
January 2011 – Authorities allowed qualifying international headquarter companies, subject to approved
registration with the Financial Surveillance Department of the South African Reserve Bank, to raise and deploy
capital offshore without exchange control approval.
October 2011 – Authorities (i) removed the restriction on foreign participation in the ownership of money
remittance businesses and the requirement to partner with an existing authorised dealer to conduct money
remittance business; (ii) approved criteria for consideration of individual foreign investments above R4 million;
(iii) announced that all inward-listed shares traded and settled in rand on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange will be
regarded as domestic assets; (iv) allowed South African companies to raise and deploy offshore capital of up to
R500 million without any restrictions on investing in any business; (v) withdrew the prohibition on the transfer of
additional working capital for investments below R500 million per applicant campany, per calendar year;
(vi) permitted South African companies to acquire 10 percent of equity or 20 percent of voting rights, whichever is
higher, in a foreign entity that holds investments or makes loans into any Common Monetary Area (CMA) country.

Exchange controls on capital transactions
by residents have been gradually relaxed.
The authorities’ main objective has been to
move toward a system based on prudential
limits and supervision, and away from a rigid
system of quantitative controls. Box 1
summarizes recent measures consistent with
the overall liberalization strategy that have
helped offset some of the pressure on the

Labor market statistics are published with lags
of three months. Given the seriousness of the
unemployment problem, labor market analysis
and policy design would benefit from better,
more frequent and timely labor market data. A
new quarterly Labor Force Survey has been
conducted in January 2008.
The consumer price index (CPI) covers all
households living in metropolitan and urban
areas, which represent approximately
56 percent of the total number of households
and 75 percent of private consumption
expenditure. The CPI weights were rebased in
January 2009 according to the new weights
published in July 2008. Current price indices,
which were rebased to 2008=100, are
calculated according to these weights. These
indices form the basis for calculating the yearon-year changes in the CPI for 2009 and the
month-on-month change between December

Data are compiled and disseminated according

security funds and central government’s extra
budgetary funds have been reported on an
accrual basis, starting in 2000 and 2002,
respectively. Starting in 2005, the authorities
have included additional noncash data,

accounting. South Africa currently reports data

Balance of payments
Balance of payments data are broadly
consistent with the fifth edition of the Balance

flows. Data reported for Direction of Trade

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation with
South Africa
On August 1, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with South Africa. 1
South Africa faces the immediate challenge of conducting policy under a highly uncertain
global environment and making firm progress on reforms that promote the long-run inclusive
growth needed for maintaining social cohesion.
Background
South Africa’s high external openness and integration in the global financial markets have
served the economy well. But, at the same time, they have exposed it to adverse
developments in the global economy. The authorities’ prudent macroeconomic and financial
management has contributed to preserve macroeconomic stability, and, together with
exchange rate flexibility, helped mitigate the domestic effect of changes in the external
environment.
In 2011, the recovery from the recent downturn continued—although at a moderate pace—
and GDP growth stood at 3 percent, reflecting robust domestic demand, especially private
consumption. Despite the economic growth, which also led to employment creation, the
unemployment rate remains stubbornly high. Inflation accelerated to just above the upper
limit of the inflation target band on the back of higher food and fuel prices as well as
exchange rate depreciation toward the end of the year, but has since declined. Core
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and
discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the
staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of
the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive
Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers
used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
inflation remains contained at 41 ⁄2 percent. Despite the exchange rate depreciation in real
terms, the 2011 current account deficit increased to 31 ⁄4 percent of GDP.
Although the 2012 GDP growth rate is likely to moderate to about 2.6 percent given the
weak external conditions and heighted global uncertainty, it is projected to gradually recover
over the medium term to its potential rate of about 31 ⁄2 percent. Based on this trajectory, the
output gap, which is estimated at about -1 percent in 2012, is likely to remain negative
through 2014, thus contributing to the moderation of inflation.
Countercyclical macroeconomic policies continue to support economic activity. In 2011/12,
the cyclically-adjusted deficit remained broadly stable at around 4 percent of GDP and the
gross national government debt increased to just below 40 percent of GDP—some
12 percent of GDP higher than at the onset of the financial crisis. Although the level of the
government debt is still manageable and does not pose any threat to fiscal sustainability,
together with the fiscal deficit, it suggests that fiscal space to cope with future shocks has
declined considerably.
The government’s consolidation plans, as indicated in the 2012/13 budget, envisage a
gradual decline in the cyclically-adjusted fiscal deficit, mainly reflecting a decline in public
spending as a share of GDP. This would imply gross government debt peaking at about
42 percent of GDP in 2014/15 and declining gradually thereafter. The budget also
envisages an improvement in the composition of spending through a reduction in the public
sector wage bill, while increasing capital expenditures in line with past Article IV
recommendations.
The South Africa Reserve Bank (SARB) cut the policy rate by 50 basis points to its record
low-level of 5 percent this July, after keeping it unchanged since November 2010. The real
policy rate has fluctuated around zero percent, and contributed to the recovery of credit to
the private sector and fixed capital formation. If the external environment were to deteriorate
further, the resulting moderation of inflation will allow the SARB greater room to respond.
The financial sector weathered the global financial crisis well. Financial institutions have
remained well-capitalized and liquid, and banks’ non-performing loans have partly
recovered from the effects of the financial crisis. Although vulnerabilities remain, prudent
supervision and the limited dependency on external funding have isolated the banking
sector from the recent stress in global financial markets. Reforms to strengthen financial
regulation, supervision, and crisis management, including the move toward the “twin peaks”
model over the next few years are proceeding.
If not addressed, the stubbornly high unemployment rate could become politically and
socially unsustainable. South Africa needs to build on its many policy successes to expand
employment opportunities, secure better education and health outcomes, and build more
efficient infrastructure to support inclusive growth, while maintaining macroeconomic and
financial stability in a risky global environment. Active labor market policies can help in the

3
short term, but a sustainable reduction in unemployment seems unattainable without labor
and product market reforms.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for their continued prudent economic
management in a highly volatile external environment. Directors noted that the immediate
challenge for South Africa is to calibrate the policy mix to support growth in the face of weak
external demand, while making progress on reforms that promote long-run inclusive growth
and social cohesion. They stressed the importance of boosting employment and improving
infrastructure and public services, while preserving macroeconomic and financial stability.
Directors broadly agreed that the pace of fiscal consolidation strikes the right balance
between providing stimulus in the short run and ensuring long-term sustainability. They
emphasized that the priority now is to rebalance the composition of spending away from the
wage bill in favor of productivity-enhancing investments, complemented by steps to
strengthen implementation capacity. Directors encouraged the authorities to improve tax
collection and save any revenue over-performance, with a view to rebuilding fiscal buffers
over the medium term. They welcomed the authorities’ gradual approach to reforming the
National Health Insurance and social security systems, paying careful attention to their
design, including financing options.
Directors supported the current monetary policy stance, noting that the inflation targeting
framework has provided a credible anchor for inflation expectations. With the balance of
risks tilted to the downside, Directors agreed that monetary policy should remain
accommodative, especially given the limited fiscal space. They stressed the need to remain
vigilant and adjust policy as warranted.
Directors noted that South Africa’s highly flexible exchange rate regime has helped smooth
the effects of external shocks. They stressed the importance of wage moderation and
increased competition in product markets to enhance external competitiveness. In view of
heightened external risks and an expected increase in foreign liabilities, Directors generally
supported a cautious build-up of reserve buffers, taking into account the cost of holding
reserves.
Directors underscored that job creation is an urgent national priority to reduce the
stubbornly high rate of unemployment, especially among the youth. They supported the
government’s targeted active labor market policy measures, including temporary public
works programs. At the same time, sustained efforts are needed to address more
fundamental structural problems, particularly with respect to the wage-setting mechanism,
the insider-outsider problem in labor and product markets, and access to, and the quality of,
health care and educational systems. Directors also supported the authorities’ efforts to
promote export diversification.

4
Directors observed that South Africa’s financial sector remains sound, liquid, and profitable.
They encouraged continued vigilance in monitoring underlying risks, including banks’
dependence on short-term wholesale funding, and their large exposure to home mortgages
and highly indebted households. Directors welcomed the implementation of Financial Sector
Assessment Program (FSAP) recommendations, in particular, the ambitious program to
strengthen the legal framework for bank supervision and improve crisis management. They
looked forward to progress in achieving Basel III benchmarks. Directors welcomed the
authorities’ gradual and cautious approach to liberalizing capital controls on residents and
replacing them with prudential regulations.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The staff report (use the free Adobe Acrobat
