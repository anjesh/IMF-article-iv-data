INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
REPUBLIC OF ESTONIA
Staff Report for the 2010 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2010 Consultation with the Republic of Estonia
Approved by Anne-Marie Gulde-Wolf and Aasim Husain
January 11, 2011
Executive Summary
On January 1, Estonia joined the euro area amidst a strengthening export-led recovery. Estonia
has the distinction of being the only EU country, aside from Sweden, whose fiscal deficit does not
exceed the Maastricht limit. In its first year in the euro area, staff projects that growth will accelerate
to about 3½ percent. Still, unemployment is high and continued progress in job creation will likely be
hampered by skill mismatches. Inflation is also projected to increase reflecting the full-year impact of
food and fuel price shocks, but core inflation should remain subdued. At end-2010, downside risks
have become more prevalent with renewed tensions in global financial markets.
The key policy challenge is to ensure that Estonia remains on a sustainable growth path. In this
regard, the consultation focused on three areas:
Fiscal policy. Despite forthcoming elections, the 2011 budget has kept a tight rein on expenditures.
Sticking to the budget will be essential to reaffirm the authorities’ commitment to prudent fiscal
policy and, with euro adoption no longer serving as an incentive, further enhance credibility. The
authorities’ medium-term goal of restoring a balanced budget provides a natural benchmark to
safeguard sustainability and fiscal buffers. A full-fledged medium-term budgetary framework would
support consolidation and avert pro-cyclical policies. Still, automatic stabilizers should operate up to
the Maastricht limit and positive revenue surprises should be saved.
Financial system. While credit has been declining, Estonia’s mostly Nordic-owned banks have so far
been resilient. Access to the euro system’s facilities will lessen risks. Still, vigilance is needed to
ensure that liquidity facilities operate effectively and bank capitalization and provisioning remain
appropriate given a weakened portfolio associated with the earlier credit boom, global financial
uncertainty, and forthcoming regulatory and legal changes. Also, national and cross-border bank
resolution frameworks need to be further enhanced.
Harnessing Estonia’s potential. Deploying all of its resources will require addressing skill
mismatches that intensified in the aftermath of the collapse of the construction boom. Besides a stable
macroeconomic environment, proven flexibility of the labor market, and continuing efforts to
enhance the effectiveness of active labor market policies, boosting competitiveness and productivity
will require climbing up the technology and quality ladder. EU structural funds can continue
supporting life-long learning, increases in labor mobility, and needed infrastructure investment

I. CONTEXT1
1.
Despite enduring one of the sharpest contractions in the EU, Estonia has been
successful in its all-out efforts to join the euro area. The authorities have resolutely
persevered with policies based on satisfying the Maastricht criteria, which entailed a fiscal
adjustment of about 9 percent of GDP in 2009. The 2010 fiscal deficit was only some
1 percent of GDP and thus Estonia has earned the distinction of being the only EU country
aside from Sweden to keep their fiscal deficit below the Maastricht limit.
2.
Driven by external demand, economic growth has strengthened in 2010
(Figure 1). Annual growth resumed in the second quarter with rising exports of intermediate
inputs and capital goods and briskly paced increases in manufacturing activity. Exports have
continued growing in the third quarter and approached pre-crisis levels. Mirroring export
orders and Estonia’s integration in the international production chain, stock building—
associated not with increases in retail goods but with increases in imported intermediate
inputs—has surged and provided a sizable contribution to growth (but has lowered the
measured net export contribution). Gross capital formation and private consumption have
remained subdued. The latter reflects weak labor markets and household balance sheets,
partly due to an earlier credit boom.2

Inflation has picked up and recently, defying double-digit unemployment, so have
wages. Prices have surprised on the upside reflecting global food and fuel price developments,
which have a disproportionately large impact in Estonia (Annex I), but also reflecting adjustments
in administered prices that resulted in a 1½ percentage-points boost to inflation in 2010. Core
prices have begun increasing at a moderate pace reflecting rising service prices but, after having
declined in 2009, their rebounds have exceeded those in neighboring economies (Figure 2).
Wages have surprised on the upside and increased by about 1 percent (year-on-year) in the second
and third quarters of 2010. This has broadly reflected the strength in manufacturing and traded
goods sectors, and has occurred despite high unemployment; the latter has declined from
almost 20 percent in the first quarter to 15½ percent in the third quarter of 2010. Still, long-term
unemployment has increased—possibly associated with an increase in structural unemployment
adversely impacting long-run growth—with rising vacancies (Figure 3). These developments
point to the difficulties mismatched skills pose to resource reallocation in an otherwise flexible
labor market. Regardless, business sector profitability has improved smartly.

outcome in 2010. The fiscal deficit is projected to
have fallen to about 1 percent of GDP (ESA-95), or about 1¼ percent of GDP lower than
anticipated in the 2010 budget. Central government spending has been kept close to budget levels
even as general elections near. Revenues have been bolstered by one-off sale of CO2 emission
rights (about 1 percent of GDP) and, to a lesser extent, by the ongoing recovery. Gross debt will
decline to about 7 percent of GDP—remaining the lowest in the EU—and Estonia will continue
holding a net external asset position in 2010.
7.
Estonia’s external adjustment has continued with some gains in competitiveness. The
reversal of the current account balance from a deficit in 2008 to a surplus in the third quarter
of 2010 has mainly reflected a marked improvement in the trade balance (Table 3 and Figure 4).
Following a sharp contraction in exports and imports in 2009, the former have increased in line
with Nordic trading partners’ activity in the first three quarters of 2010 but the latter rebounded
less sharply. Competitiveness has improved recently partly driven by cyclical factors (Box 1). The
financial account has recorded a sizable deficit reflecting largely banking sector flows abroad,
associated with domestic deleveraging and reserve requirement harmonization with the euro area.
These funds have reduced liabilities to parent banks and increased liquid foreign assets. As a
result, gross external debt declined to 118 percent of GDP at end-September 2010.

6
Box 1. Estonia’s Competitiveness Developments
While competitiveness appears to have improved, mixed signals have continued from standard
CGER methods. Taken at face value, current account-based methods suggest that Estonia’s real
exchange rate is undervalued by around 2 and 4 percent. Caution should be exerted in interpreting
these indicators given cyclical developments as these may reflect the large cyclical decline in imports
rather than undervaluation. In contrast, direct assessments of the real exchange rate still suggest that
the real exchange rate is overvalued. Regardless, compared to 2009 Article IV consultation assessment
these results suggest a small improvement in competitiveness.

Price- and cost-based indicators broadly support a gradual positive trend in competitiveness.
Various measures of REER have declined since 2009. The REER deflated by unit labor costs in the
manufacturing or by the export deflator has shown further gains in competitiveness in the second
quarter of 2010. In addition, the declines are less pronounced for REER measures that place less
weight on the traded sector. These differences may reflect the fact that measures placing less weight
on the traded sector may also reflect the previous construction boom as well as Balassa-Samuelson
effects.
Regardless, Estonia’s export market share remained broadly stable pointing to gains in nonprice competitiveness. Despite the measured appreciation of the REER and weakness in trading
partners during the crisis, EU export market shares have remained stable. Improvements in non-price
competitiveness may have been associated with large foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows. FDI
may have provided access to technology and foreign markets with vertical integration contributing to
its external performance. Also, Estonia has been gradually moving up the technology and quality
ladder relative to its competitors and it scores broadly well in terms of the quality of human and
physical infrastructure and the business environment relative to the EU (Annex II).

II. OUTLOOK
8.
Growth is poised to strengthen and remain export-driven in 2011. Growth is
projected to increase from 2½ percent in 2010 to 3½ percent in 2011. Exports are expected to
continue boosting economic activity mirroring the strength in Estonia’s main trading partners.
Still, high household debt as well as slow progress in reducing unemployment will burden
final domestic demand, which is expected to remain sluggish. Relatedly, credit growth is also
projected to remain low.
9.
Inflation is envisaged to persist in 2011. Price increases are projected to rise from
about 2¾ percent in 2010 to about 4 percent in 2011. While the impact of administered price
increases will wane, the full-year impact of food and fuel prices will be felt. In light of price
and wage developments, inflation projections remain subject to large uncertainty but, on
balance, core inflation should remain subdued throughout 2011 and increase on average
primarily reflecting base effects of the disinflation in early-2010.
10.
Positive surprises to the outlook are possible, but downside risks appear more
prevalent at end-2010. Faster growth is feasible if trading partners’ activity proves lasting
but this could pose sectoral wage pressures associated with labor market constraints. Also,
euro adoption could afford a one-time impetus as residual exchange rate risk vanishes and the
risk of adverse regional spillovers recedes. But the risk of slower growth—including from
renewed uncertainty in global financial and sovereign markets and the tail risk of global
double-dip recession—has increased. Besides direct trade-related effects, a faltering recovery
or if unemployment otherwise becomes entrenched could result in new nonperforming loans
(NPLs) weighing on bank’s willingness to lend. Renewed banking sector shocks, including
through parent banks, could also pose risks to domestic financial intermediation.
11.
The authorities concurred that growth prospects have improved even as risks
have risen. They noted that economic activity remained dependent on trading partners’
growth and expressed some concern about the sustainability of the latter. Still, the authorities
were more sanguine regarding private investment prospects as, despite the anticipated overall
continued economic slack, capacity constraints in export-oriented sectors may trigger
investment. But rising inflation may limit increases in real household incomes and constrain
real consumption. Regarding inflation, they noted that while Estonia’s consumption patterns
made it more sensitive to food and energy price shocks, increases in some individual prices
were unusually large and could reflect inadequate competition. In this connection, legal
investigations have been opened. Core inflation was, nonetheless, expected to remain subdued
in 2011. They also considered wage increases to be somewhat surprising, but may, in addition
to mismatch skills, represent a measurement problem as workers with lower skills and
compensation levels were disproportionately laid off as unemployment increased sharply in
late-2009 and early-2010. The authorities broadly considered that credit availability was
adequate.

9
III. POLICY CHALLENGES
12.
Against this backdrop, Estonia faces the challenge of remaining on a sustainable
growth path that will lead to steady income convergence while fully employing its
resources. The authorities’ policies have largely been in line with Fund Advice (Box 2) but
conjunctural circumstances and longer-term challenges warrant continued attention. In this
regard, the consultation focused on three key areas.

Box 2. Implications of Fund Advice
Relations between Estonia and the Fund have remained excellent. Policies have been
characterized by a high degree of ownership—a key factor in Estonia’s economic success—and
these have been generally consistent with Executive Board recommendations. But large
increases in current spending resulted in an ill-timed loosening of the fiscal stance in the boom
years. Since then, corrective actions, including expenditure reversals and increased indirect
taxation, have been in line with Fund advice. Most of the key recommendations of
the 2009 FSSA update have been adopted (Annex III).

A. Safeguarding Fiscal Consolidation and Counter-Cyclical Policy
13.
Despite the upcoming elections, the 2011 budget envisages only a small increase
in the fiscal deficit, thereby continuing Estonia’s prudent macroeconomic policies. The
deficit is targeted to reach about

2/ First difference in the cyclically adjusted structural balance, with sign reversed.

14.
Achieving the budget target has particular importance for the euro area’s newest
member. The authorities argued that, besides keeping the deficit comfortably below the
Maastricht limit, sticking to the budget would reaffirm Estonia’s preference for fiscal rectitude
even without the incentive of euro adoption. While supporting the target, staff noted that should
downside risks emerge, the authorities are advised to allow automatic stabilizers to operate up to
the Maastricht limit. Likewise, strict adherence to the budget’s spending limits will be essential to
avoid pro-cyclical policy if revenue collections exceed projections.
15.
Looking forward, the authorities foresee restoring a balanced budget by 2014 under
current policies. Although conservative given Estonia’s net public asset position, this would
nevertheless help safeguard fiscal buffers, that are critical for mitigating the impact of volatility,
including in the context of ongoing global and regional financial uncertainty, and which proved
critical in weathering the global financial crisis of 2008–09. While broadly feasible under current
policies with some one-off measures set to expire (including investments obligations associated
with CO2 emission rights sales), meeting the target will entail holding operational expenditures
unchanged in real terms. This will imply reducing expenditures by about 3 percent of GDP and
thus bringing Estonia’s public spending closer to its pre-crisis level (Figure 5). Expenditure
pressures are bound to emerge in light of the 2009 cuts (about 5½ percent of GDP), limited social
benefits, and improving economic conditions. If offsetting measures are necessary, given the
expenditure compression built into current policies, these should focus on the revenue side with a
view of minimizing tax distortions and supporting resource reallocation. Specifically, these could
include broadening tax bases, increasing the VAT rate to narrow differences with neighboring
countries, making greater use of property taxation, and boosting environmental taxes. In addition,
as consolidation progresses, the authorities’ long-run target to gradually reduce overall labor taxes

11
can be considered. This focus, however, should not hinder further efforts to improve expenditure
efficiency.
16.
Enhancing Estonia’s medium-term budgetary framework (MTBF) could help
maintain fiscal sustainability and avert pro-cyclical policies. Such a framework could include
a target for the cyclically-adjusted overall balance and binding medium-term spending ceilings
(Annex IV). Its success in Estonia will hinge on the dual requirements of simplicity and
transparency needed to facilitate communication, verification, and accountability. To enhance its
credibility and facilitate monitoring, spending limits should exclude those of a cyclical nature
(such as unemployment benefits) and relatively unpredictable EU structural-fund related
spending. In addition there will be a need to address the high proportion of earmarked spending—
complicating expenditure control—and ensure that the MTBF operates effectively at the general
government level. Regarding the latter, the recently passed “Act of Financial Management of
Local Municipalities,” which controls local government balances, is a step in this direction.
Regardless, Estonia’s strong fiscal position imparts a distinct advantage because it needs a
comparably small medium-term adjustment. On the other hand, large swings in its economic
structure and activity amid real convergence may obscure cyclical developments.
17.
The authorities stressed that conservative fiscal policies would remain the hallmark
of Estonia’s economic approach. Tight fiscal policy has served Estonia well and underpinned
the success of its currency board arrangement. They stressed that prudent fiscal policy was
motivated not by euro adoption—a welcome bonus—but by needed fiscal prudence to support the
currency board. Although this need had now passed, with euro accession, the authorities pointed
to the 2011 budget that, despite upcoming elections, will exert a tight rein on spending while
protecting social spending. In this regard, they highlighted the importance of restoring pillar II
pension fund contributions and expressed their intention of continuing to do so.
18.
They insisted that restoring a fiscal balance or better in the medium-term would
continue guiding fiscal policy, despite euro adoption and low public debt levels. The
authorities recognized, nonetheless, that spending pressures could emerge but expressed
confidence that continued expenditure efficiency gains would keep fiscal consolidation on track.
Moreover, their medium-term goal would maintain fiscal sustainability and ensure that fiscal
buffers would be rebuilt to pre-crisis levels. In this connection, while the authorities re-iterated
their desire to reduce labor taxation they stated that this would have to be accommodated within
their medium-term objectives. They recognized that a MTBF could help avoid pro-cyclical
policies and envisaged its implementation to be coordinated with revisions to the Stability and
Growth Pact currently under discussion.

reductions in assets. Stress tests by the Estonian supervisors reflecting a scenario with sluggish
growth and more stringent tests by the parent authorities indicate resilience to cope with renewed
credit risk. The authorities in parent banks countries have nonetheless kept in place extensive debt
guarantee and financial recapitalization packages introduced during the financial crisis.
20.
But banks remain vulnerable to shocks. Even though NPLs have been low, they are
high by international comparison. Also, about half of NPL mortgages remain in negative equity,
household indebtedness is high, and property markets remain weak and illiquid. New NPLs could
emerge if unemployment fails to subside or if lending rates are pushed up by sudden increases in
European interbank interest rates. Local banks are also exposed to adverse spillovers effects
through parent banks, including a rapid correction of asset prices in home countries or disruptions
in international funding markets.

Box 3. Why Are NPLs Lower in Estonia Than in Other Baltic Countries?
As elsewhere in the Baltics, the recession in Estonia was severe. Baltic countries could not avoid a credit boombust cycle despite attempts to slow credit via restrictive prudential and monetary measures. Yet, Estonia’s NPLs
increased to only about 7 percent in the second quarter of 2010, or roughly half those in Lithuania and Latvia. A
few factors are at play.


Definitional differences. In Estonia, loans are
classified as non-performing when they are
past 60 days due and, unlike Lithuania, do not
include all impaired loans. The latter would
increase NPLs (comparable to those in
Lithuania) to around 10 percent.

as loans 60 days overdue, in Latvia as 90 days overdue.
In addition, the composition of assets may
have also differed. In Lithuania, domestically-owned banks have been more exposed to corporate and
consumer credit, both of which experienced higher levels of distress.3 Finally, risk management in
some domestic banks may have been weaker than in foreign banks. In Latvia, the second largest bank
(domestically owned) was subject to risk management failures and taken over by the government in
late 2008. In Lithuania (Latvia), NPLs reached an estimated 18.8 (14.8) percent of loans in the foreignowned banks compared to 29 (20) percent in other banks in the first quarter of 2010.4



Euro adoption. Estonia’s near-term euro adoption prospect encouraged a rapid convergence of interest
rates to euro area levels lowering debt servicing. With Latvia and Lithuania facing considerable fiscal
challenges, risk spreads in these countries have remained higher.

(home country) public guarantees may be phased out in 2011.
22.
The banking sector will be shaped by forthcoming legal and regulatory changes at
home and abroad aiming to strengthen financial stability and address debt overhang. In this
connection, vigilance will be needed so that anticipated changes do not, via pressures on
profitability, have undesirable side-effects such as increased risk taking and regulatory arbitrage.
Changes to liquidity regulations under Basel 3 are expected to affect Nordic banks the most as
they will be required to address their large funding mismatches.5 Banks are also expected to
maintain their high ratios of capitalization. In addition, some home authorities are imposing bank
levies on parent banks while in Estonia contributions to the deposit guarantee scheme (DGS) are
set to nearly double to an annualized 0.18 percent in second quarter of 2011. Also, changes to the
insolvency framework such as Estonia’s new household debt restructuring law and the shortening
of the bankcruptcy period from 5 years to between 3 and 5 years, can help address debt overhang
but could pose risks to credit growth (Box 4).
23.
While crisis management preparedness has progressed, bank resolution powers have
remained limited and need strengthening. Supervisors’ early intervention powers appear
extensive (e.g. to replace management, curtail dividend payments, or impose higher prudential
ratios). Estonia’s bank resolution tool kit, however, is restricted to imposing insolvency, a
moratorium suspending bank’s activities, and, nationalization following recently approved
legislation. The latter also has enhanced crisis-related on-site supervision powers and has aligned
the DGS with changes in EU directives.6 Still, weaknesses in resolution powers remain as legal
protection of resolution authorities is limited, courts can override their decisions, and breaking up
the balance sheet of a distressed bank can be conducted only with the consent of shareholders.
Also, deposits cannot be transferred to another bank nor can the deposit guarantee fund be used in
crisis resolution.
24.
The cross-border crisis cooperation framework has advanced but further progress is
essential. The 2010 Nordic-Baltic Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) provides a broad
overview of criteria used to establish ex-post sharing of crisis costs.7 In this connection, all
authorities commit to identifying obstacles and solutions for coordinated decision making and
bank resolution, establishing effective communication procedures and continuing the work on
detailing burden sharing criteria. Still, the MOU is not binding and the implementation of crisis
preparedness measures remains at an early stage.

Eligibility was extended to all firms, insured deposits increased from €50,000 to €100,000 and the pay-out period
shortened to 20 working days. In view of increased eligibility, in 2011, and despite the increase in contributions, the
deposit coverage is anticipated to decline to about 2¼ percent, below the target rate of 2½ percent and below the
FSAP recommended target of 4½ percent.

15
Box 4. Estonia’s Household Debt Restructuring Law
In the wake of the global financial crisis and property market busts, a number of countries have
introduced household debt restructuring schemes, (the Czech Republic, 2008), in some cases also
involving fiscal incentives (the UK Homeowners Support Mortgage Scheme, 2009). In the same vein,
Estonia has also introduced a law—coming into force in April 2011—aimed at facilitating
restructuring of debt obligations of natural persons (including entrepreneurs) facing payment
difficulties. The law foresees a case-by-case restructuring of all liabilities and does not envisage the
use of public funds. Borrowers facing debt payment difficulties can avoid formal bankruptcy by
petitioning for restructuring. This entails submitting a restructuring plan to creditors outlining the
proposed adjustments (such as extension of maturities or a reduction in claims) to restore solvency.
While the law encourages out-of-court settlement, its procedures rely heavily on court input. All
secured claims (equivalent to the value of collateral) may be restructured only with consent of secured
creditors. For unsecured debts, however, the court has the power to override creditors’ decisions. In all
cases, the courts are tasked with supervising the implementation of restructuring plans that may be
challenging as Estonia ranks behind its peers in terms of contract enforcement. In this connection,
Estonia’s experience with the recently introduced restructuring law for legal persons could provide
useful lessons. Specifically, there is evidence of delays in courts’ processing petitions perhaps due to
the considerable court input under the law and many judges’ limited specialized financial background.
Specialization in insolvency matters has occurred only in larger courts. Debtors may also be reluctant
to file for restructuring (and also bankruptcy) possibly due to a number of factors, including high
advisory fees, or other costs.

25.
The authorities agreed with the need for continued close vigilance and the overall
assessment of financial sector strengths and risks. While capital and liquidity buffers of
Estonian banks were elevated, they stressed that domestic supervisory scrutiny has been
maintained, including by using stress tests to determine the adequacy of capitalization. The
authorities saw risks to local subsidiaries mainly stemming from spillovers from shocks to parent
banks. In this regard, the authorities underscored the considerable progress made in improving
crisis preparedness over the past couple of years. While noting that bank resolution powers were
constitutionally constrained, they explained that resolution tools would be expanded further in
line with EU decisions and would be mindful of responsibilities vis-à-vis home jurisdictions given
the importance of foreign bank ownership. The authorities saw particular merit in using the
relatively well pre-funded deposit guarantee scheme in the EU context for bank resolution. But
they were more guarded about establishing an additional resolution fund. Regarding the
household debt restructuring law, they noted that it was better balanced than initially feared and
underscored that the key will lie in its court implementation. Developments would be followed
closely to ensure that it not undermine the rule of law nor financial intermediation.
C. Restoring Competitiveness and Fully Deploying Potential Resources
Enhancing external competitiveness will be critical for Estonia’s sustainable growth. Wage
increases outstripped productivity gains during the boom that, besides eroding

16
competitiveness, resulted in lopsided expansion of the nontraded goods sector, particularly
construction. Sustainable growth however will require rebalancing the economy towards exports
as well as continuing to climb up the technology and quality ladder and diversifying export’s
destination (Annex II). The initiative to create an environment conducive to foreign direct
investment in industries with export potential and high value added represents a welcome step in
this direction and can potentially provide access to technology and markets through vertical and
horizontal integration. Likewise, the program to improve access to financing to boost investment
in these strategic areas can help develop high-value added exports.

26.
Continued human capital development will support full resource use and income
convergence. Addressing skill mismatches through continued progress in enhancing the
education system will be essential. In this regard, the authorities have implemented a number of
measures focusing on training and education of unemployed workers and introduced a voucher
program to help youth complete their tertiary studies. Intensive use of EU-structural funds has
improved vocational, unemployment, and in-job training programs. In this regard, exploring
synergies among these programs as well as potential efficiency gains and continued focus on
life-long learning and language training, in additional to infrastructure development, may further
enhance the effectiveness of the education system to support the economy’s needs and bolster
labor mobility, including geographically. Needed enhancements in infrastructure will also require
continued use of EU structural funds.
27.
The authorities underscored their continued commitment to enhance competitiveness
and lower unemployment. They stressed that a stable macroeconomic environment and a
business friendly climate were central to establish the preconditions needed to support the
modernizing of the private sector’s production base supporting Estonia’s world class ICT and
enhancing its lagging transportation system. In this regard, the Estonia 2020 Competitiveness
Strategy has established two key quantitative targets: increasing the employment rate of workingage individuals by about 15 percentage points to 76 percent, with a similar increase in
productivity per worker to bring it to 80 percent of the EU average. This will require attracting

17
investment, including that associated with euro adoption, and continued efforts to enhance crossborder infrastructure, address rigidities in ALMP, and exploit synergies among various programs
with a view of enhancing the effectiveness of the educational system.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
28.
Having successfully adopted the euro, Estonia now faces the challenge of ensuring
that its export-led recovery remains sustainable. Euro membership represents the culmination
of 18 years of a fundamentally sound currency board arrangement supported by a strong
commitment to fiscal rectitude. In 2011, Estonia will see a strengthening recovery with core
inflation likely remaining subdued. Recent wage increases have coincided with rising profitability
but these increases warrant close monitoring as unemployment lingers and price and cost
competiveness, while improving, have remained below pre-crisis levels.
29.
Consistent with this challenge, the 2011 budget keeps a tight rein on
expenditures. Sticking to the 2011 general government expenditure ceilings will reaffirm the
authorities’ commitment to prudent macroeconomic management, and further enhance credibility
as the euro area’s newest member. Still, if downside risks materialize low public debt and fiscal
buffers provide space for automatic stabilizers to operate up to the Maastricht limit. Should
revenues surprise on the upside, strict adherence to spending limits will be used to avert procyclical fiscal policy.
30.
Looking forward, the authorities’ medium-term goal of restoring a balanced budget
maintains a conservative fiscal stance. Besides being consistent with EU obligations and
preserving low debt levels, this goal would safeguard fiscal buffers needed to bolster the
economy’s resilience. A balanced budget can be broadly achieved under current policies
foreseeing unchanged operational expenditures in real terms and thus implying expenditure
compression as a share of GDP. Still, demands to boost spending are bound to emerge and, if
offsetting measures are necessary, given the expenditure compression in current policies, these
should focus largely on the revenue side. But this should not detract from continuing efforts to
improve expenditure efficiency nor impair education and investment spending.
31.
A full-fledged medium-term budgetary fiscal framework could usefully support
Estonia’s consolidation efforts and avert pro-cyclical fiscal policy. Such a framework by
including binding multi-year expenditure ceilings can help avoid procyclical policy. Estonia’s
strong fiscal tradition and its relatively small adjustment needs impart a distinct advantage in
operating such a framework even though difficulties may arise in identifying cyclical
developments, particularly during the income convergence process.
32.
The challenge for the financial sector entails preserving stability in light of legacy
risks from the earlier credit boom, elevated global financial tensions and forthcoming legal
and regulatory changes. Joining the euro system will lessen financial sector risks. But continued
ongoing vigilance will nevertheless be required so that all banks are prepared to access the
eurosystem’s liquidity facilities and that their contingency liquidity plans remain effective. Also,

18
there will be a need to ensure that provisioning and capitalisation remain ample to cope with
potential risks. In the coming years, prompt use of prudential measures should help quell undue
risk-taking activities and regulatory arbitrage that may result from changes in the regulatory and
legal environment. Estonia’s new household debt restructuring law can help address debt
overhang but it will be essential that its implementation not undermine financial intermediation
nor harm confidence in a rules-based system. In due time, a broad review of the insolvency
framework should be undertaken.
33.
The high integration with Nordic financial systems underscores the need for
continued efforts to develop effective cross-border and national crisis management and
resolution mechanisms. In close collaboration with home authorities of parent banks, there is a
need to further strengthen the authorities’ resolution powers and expand available tools. The 2010
Nordic-Baltic MOU on crisis management—a pioneering step in cross-border cooperation—
provides an ideal framework for doing so. Joint work should focus on further developing the
ex-ante criteria for crisis-related burden sharing. In this context of cross-border cooperation,
consideration could also be given to a pre-financed crisis resolution fund.
34.
More broadly, sustainable growth entails fully harnessing Estonia’s resources, as
well as continuing improvements in productivity and competitiveness. Besides safeguarding
Estonia’s stable macroeconomic and business-friendly environment, supported by flexible labor
markets, long-term growth will entail reallocating resources to the tradable sector. The
authorities’ “Estonia 2020” competitiveness strategy highlights many of these issues. These
programs should be implemented promptly and complemented by exploiting synergies and
potential efficiency gains among various education and training programs. Also, boosting
productivity and competitiveness will require continued use of EU structural funds in support of
life-long learning to enhance human capital development and needed infrastructure improvement,
increase labor mobility and establish a solid foundation for rising living standards.
35.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Estonia be held on the
standard 12-month cycle.

1/ Large reductions projected for 2010-11 reflect in part the expected impact of reserve requirement harmonization associated with euro adoption.
2/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; r = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms, g = real GDP growth rate,
e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
3/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic currency (e > 0) and rising inflation
(based on GDP deflator).
4/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
5/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
6/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
7/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels
of the last projection year.

ANNEX I. IMPACT OF GLOBAL FUEL AND FOOD PRICES8
36.
Reduced-form VAR models have been used to examine the relative impact of
global food and fuel price shocks on Estonia. Specifically, these models have included four
variables of interest: global food and fuel price indexes from WEO, and HICP and core price
indexes from Eurostat. Using logged indexes from January 2000 to July 2010, five separate
models were estimated: Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, as well as averages for the euro area and
the EU. For consistency and cross-model comparability, all models have included three lags,
which was the highest number of lags where these were stable. Global shocks were placed
first in a Choleski ordering and the resulting impulse responses were normalized to reflect a
shock equal to one percentage point.
37.
The results suggest that prices in Estonia and, to a lesser extent, the other Baltic
countries are disproportionately affected by global food and fuel prices. This holds not
only for HICP and but also for core prices. Keeping in mind the illustrative nature of these
models, the following stylized facts emerge:


Global fuel prices have the largest effect on Estonia’s prices. While the immediate
impact is felt on HICP, core prices also increase but with a delay of roughly three
months. The price responses in the other Baltic countries are similar but smaller; the
initial price declines are puzzling and merit further study. Regardless, these results
contrasts with the euro area and EU responses were the effect on prices was not only
smaller but centered on HICP with limited impact on core prices.



Global food prices have a similar impact in Estonia as in the other Baltic countries in
first six months but afterward price increases are greater in the latter. Moreover, these
shocks feed quickly into core prices throughout the Baltic countries. While the price
responses in the euro area or EU are smaller, they too experience an increase in core
prices albeit with a delay.

competitiveness.
39.
Non-price competitiveness thus appears to play an important role in Estonia’s
competitiveness. While standard determinants of exports performance such as relative prices
and foreign demand can largely explain its export performance (Figure A1, upper row), nonprice competitiveness—encompassing technological and structural aspects—has also
contributed to export developments. Estonia’s technological competitiveness has improved,
reflecting in part increased R&D expenditures and number of patents (Figure A1, lower row).
This thus suggests that innovation-enhancing activities have helped exports to move up the
technology and quality ladder relative to Estonia’s competitors. Regarding structural
competitiveness, Estonia scores reasonably well compared to its EU 27 peers (Table A1).

percent of exports. The degree of concentration integration can also be seen in the high
correlation of Estonia’s exports with the exports of main trading partners. The correlation is
particularly strong with Finland, but less so with Sweden, reflecting the vertical nature of
linkages of these countries with Estonia through FDI. As Estonia’s income convergence
proceeds, future FDI-related projects will likely depend on maintaining its cost advantage.

While the shift toward
research-intensive products has been
noticeable, Estonia still lags behind its
EU peers in this respect. Both patenting
activity and R&D have increased in
Estonia over the last decade, but the
relevant indicators are still below the EU
average (Figure A2). Consequently, the
share of exports of high technology
products in total exports lags those of
many EU partners.

43.
The concentration of Estonia’s exports in a small number of markets has been
beneficial, but going forward diversification will be important. Exports are highly
concentrated in terms of trading partners, with Finland and Sweden accounting for around
35 percent of total exports of goods and services. Exports are also highly concentrated in
terms of product range, with textiles, wood products, and chemicals accounting for the large
portion of Estonia’s exports to Finland and Sweden. The challenge will therefore be to
diversify Estonia’s export base by further increasing its market share in the EU, particularly
in Sweden, and/or broaden its market to less traditional partners, within the EU. This would
be important to reduce Estonia’s vulnerability to developments in trading partner’s domestic
market and to developments in the main export markets of key trading partners.

Revealed Comparative Advantage

While Estonia has broadly continued to reveal a comparative advantage in lower
value-added products, there have been some gains in higher value-added products.
Specifically, the revealed comparative advantage index (RCA),10 broken down by two

R&D intensity shows a steady increase in difficult-to-imitate research-intensive
goods, but Estonia has yet to develop a comparative advantage in these types of
goods yet.

The revealed comparative advantage index measures the relative advantage of a specific class of goods or
services (Balassa, 1965). It is based on the Ricardian comparative advantage concept and computed as:

RCA 

E

country and commodity of interest and sets of trading countries and commodities. A comparative advantage
(disadvantage) is “revealed” if RCA>1 (RCA<1).

products, with high-technology
products still having comparative

liquidity from their parent.
A crisis simulation exercise should be held. Such an exercise should
include Swedbank’s Baltic subgroup and be conducted together with the
other Baltic authorities and the Swedish authorities.
The MoF needs to complete the regulation of the payout phase of the
pension scheme including addressing potential moral hazard issues.
Increase staffing of the Financial Supervisory Authority (FSA) and

ANNEX IV. MEDIUM-TERM FISCAL FRAMEWORKS1
45.
Fiscal frameworks can take a variety of forms, although all are designed to
deliver strengthened public finances and sustainability, as well as to promote
appropriate policies from a cyclical perspective. Fiscal rules have become increasingly
common with the growing need to consolidate public sector accounts with some 80 countries
now employing them.2 Among these rules are:


Balanced budget rules (e.g., Austria, Canada, Finland, New Zealand, Portugal, Spain,
Sweden, United Kingdom) whether applied to an overall, structural or cyclical
balance are useful to deliver a debt target. An annual balanced budget rule is the
easiest to monitor and enforce but may result in pro-cyclical policy. Balancing a
cyclically-adjusted budget, while preferable from a macro perspective, requires
estimating an economy’s cyclical position.



Debt rules (e.g., EU members) directly target sustainability, but provide limited scope
for cyclical flexibility when the target is binding and scant policy guidance otherwise.



Expenditure rules (e.g., Bulgaria, Finland, Japan, Luxembourg, and Sweden) guard
against pro-cyclical policy (as revenues fluctuate with the cycle) but do not target
sustainability. These rules are thus typically supplemented by debt and/or balancedbudget rules.

46.
While all frameworks reflect country-specific circumstances, they should also
reflect a number of critical elements including:


Simplicity. To facilitate monitoring and enforcement, numerically targets or ceilings
should be clearly defined and easily computed. This requirement must be balanced
against the need to account for cyclical developments and assess output gaps.



Broadness of coverage. While it should strive to encompass the entire public sector,
that is, the general government, the complexity of fiscal institutions and the degree of
autonomy of sub-national authorities may require supplementary rules or limiting its
scope.



Flexibility. It should not unduly constrain policy response to shocks—with
exceptional circumstances spelled out before hand—and include means to deal expost with deviations.



Accountability and enforceability. These can take a variety of forms reflecting
institutions and historic circumstances, ranging from political commitments to legal,
or even constitutional, limits, and may be supplemented by independent monitoring.

APPENDIX II. ESTONIA: STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
Data provision to the Fund is generally adequate for surveillance purposes. A
May 2001 data ROSC mission found that the quality of macroeconomic statistics was
generally good. The 2009 fiscal transparency ROSC indicated that Estonia now meets nearly
all of the requirements of the transparency code, and approaches best international practice in
some areas.
2.
Estonia is a subscriber to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS). Also, the
Bank of Estonia (BoE) and the Statistical Office of Estonia (SE) periodically update on their
websites a wide variety of data on the key variables for the monetary, fiscal, real, and
external sectors.
A. Monetary and Financial Statistics
3.
The BoE has adopted the framework of the ECB for the compilation of monetary and
financial statistics, which is consistent with the IMF’s Monetary and Financial Statistics
Manual. STA and BoE have completed the data work on mapping Estonia’s monetary data
into the Standardized Report Forms which have been published in the June issue of the IFS
Supplement.
4.
Aggregate financial data are compiled by the BoE and reported on a monthly basis.
The majority of statistics are disseminated on the Bank of Estonia’s webpage on the 17th
banking day after the end of the reporting period, with data on off-balance sheet activities
published on the 18th banking day. Data for individual banks are also available on a quarterly
basis since 2008Q1 on the Finanacial Supervision Authority’s webpage.
5.
Estonia participated in the Fund’s Coordinated Compilation Exercise for Financial
Soundness Indicators and regularly provides a large number of FSIs.
B. Balance of Payments Statistics
6.
Quarterly balance of payments and IIP data are compiled by the BoE. Daily exchange
rate data are available with a one working day lag. Monthly import/export data are available
with a two month lag. Quarterly balance of payments and public and private external debt
data are available with a 70-day lag.
C. Government Finance Statistics
7.
All fiscal data are published by the Ministry of Finance (MoF). Historical data are
also available on SE’s website.


Monthly central government operations data are available with a lag of up to 25 days
after the end of the month. The government began reporting monthly data on a
consolidated government basis in January 1999 on its Estonian-language web site.
Quarterly data on foreign loans and guarantees by the central government are

5

published in Estonian with a monthly lag. The MoF is using one of its two allowed
SDDS flexibility options on the timeliness of monthly central government operations
data, and have recently started to disseminate these data on the National Summary
Data Page.


Comprehensive annual data on central and local government operations (cash basis)
are reported in the GFS Yearbook. These data include a statement of operations and
the government balance sheet, including data on financial assets and liabilities, both
domestic and foreign. Quarterly data for general government, based on the
GFSM 2001 framework, are now regularly reported for inclusion in the International
Finance Statistics.
D. National Accounts

8.
Data on GDP (quarterly and annually) are published by SE with a lag of three months
after the end of the quarter. Flash estimates of aggregate GDP are available two months after
the end of the reference period. The monthly CPI is available seven days after the end of the
reference period. Monthly PPI and export price indices are available four weeks after the end
of the reference period. Monthly indicators of retail trade, industrial output, industrial sales,
are reported approximately six weeks to two months after the end of the reference period.
Nominal monthly wage data and quarterly nominal and real wage data are published with a
two-month lag.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2010 Article IV Consultation with
the Republic of Estonia
On January 31, 2011, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Estonia. 1
Background
On January 1, Estonia was successful in its all-out efforts to join the euro, while holding
the distinction of being the only European Union country, aside from Sweden, whose
fiscal deficit does not exceed the Maastricht limit.
Amidst a strengthening export-led recovery, economic growth recovered in 2010.
Exports of intermediate inputs and capital goods have grown briskly, mirroring
developments in Estonia’s main trading partners. Domestic demand has remained
subdued, nonetheless, with private consumption burdened by weak labor markets and
household balance sheets weakened by the bursting of an earlier credit boom. While
unemployment has declined from its peak of about 20 percent in early-2010 to about
15½ percent more recently, continued progress in job creation will likely be hampered
by a lack of skilled workers in growing sectors.
Inflation has picked up in 2010 and, despite double-digit unemployment, so have wages.
Prices have surprised on the upside reflecting global food and fuel prices. Core prices
have also begun increasing but at a moderate rate. Recent wage increases have defied
not only high unemployment but also increases in vacancies and long-term
unemployment. These developments point to the difficulties mismatched skills pose to
Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings
up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

resource reallocation in an otherwise flexible labor market. Regardless, business sector
profitability has increased smartly in 2010 and Estonia’s competitiveness has improved
though it has yet to fully recover the losses experienced during the boom years.
Looking forward, growth is envisaged to gradually increase but remain below its precrisis rate. In its first year in the euro area, staff projects that Estonia’s growth will
accelerate from about 2½ percent in 2010 to about 3½ percent in 2011 as exports
continue to propel growth. Inflation is also projected to rise from about 2¾ percent in
2010 to about 4 percent in 2011 reflecting the full-year impact of food and fuel price
shocks. Core inflation should remain subdued. At end-2010, downside risks have
become more prevalent with renewed tensions in global financial markets.
The key policy challenge that Estonia faces is to ensure that its economy remains on a
sustainable growth path.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors congratulated Estonia on its successful adoption of the euro—the
result of sound macroeconomic policies and resolute commitment to fiscal discipline
underpinning a long-standing currency board arrangement. Directors welcomed a return
to export-led growth and the prospect of a further rebalancing of the economy. They
noted the challenges ahead in maintaining growth while reducing high unemployment.
Against this backdrop, Directors were reassured by the authorities’ commitment to
continue fiscal prudence, closely monitor price developments, improve the resilience of
the financial system, and enhance productivity and external competitiveness, taking full
advantage of the euro zone membership.
Directors supported the 2011 budget, which continues to rely on tight expenditure
control. Strict adherence to the budget’s spending limits would further enhance Estonia’s
credibility in its first year in the euro area. Directors concurred that Estonia has ample
fiscal space for automatic stabilizers to operate up to the Maastricht limit, if downside
risks materialize, with a few seeing scope for a more accommodative policy stance in
support of economic activity in the short run.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ medium-term goal of returning to budget surpluses
to restore fiscal reserves and keep public debt at low levels. While achieving this target
will require substantial expenditure compression, it will be important to protect education
and investment spending, and at the same time continue to improve expenditure
efficiency. Directors recommended considering revenue measures such as indirect and
environmental taxes, if the need arises. Enhancing Estonia’s medium-term fiscal
framework and transparency would aid consolidation efforts and avert pro-cyclical fiscal
policies.
Directors observed that the financial sector had weathered the crisis relatively well but
risks remain from the earlier credit boom. Safeguarding stability in the context of
continued global financial market tension and upcoming changes in regulations is a
priority. While euro area membership is expected to help lessen liquidity risks,
supervisory vigilance remains critical to maintain adequate bank provisioning and
capitalization. Directors encouraged the authorities to do their utmost to ensure that the
implementation of the new household debt restructuring law does not undermine

3
confidence in the rule of law or financial intermediation. They welcomed the
2010 Nordic-Baltic Memorandum of Understanding on crisis management, and looked
forward to further progress in developing bank resolution frameworks in coordination
with the relevant cross-border authorities.
Directors welcomed the “Estonia 2020” competitiveness strategy, noting that its prompt
implementation should help boost employment and productivity. They encouraged
continued efforts to promote resource reallocation to the tradable sector, facilitated by
flexible labor markets and appropriate wage policies. These efforts should be
complemented with education and retraining programs to address skill mismatches and
improved capacity to absorb EU-structural funds for infrastructure and human capital
development.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The staff report (use the free Adobe Acrobat
Reader to view this pdf file) for the 2010 Article IV Consultation with Estonia is also available.

Statement by Per Callesen, Executive Director for the Republic of Estonia
and Andres Sutt, Senior Advisor to the Executive Director
January 31, 2011
The authorities thank Mr. Hoffmaister and the mission team for the frank and constructive
discussions. They broadly share the staff’s assessment in most areas and appreciate the
medium-term focus of the policy discussions.
Estonia became the 17th member of the Eurozone on January 1, 2011. This achievement
marks a historic milestone in Estonia’s economic integration. In the authorities’ view, over
the past 18 years the currency board arrangement has served Estonia as a policy anchor
exceptionally well. During this period the living standards of the society measured by the
GDP per capita have increased from less than a third to around two thirds of the EU average.
They see this as proof that no exchange rate regime is superior to another, and that what
matters is the overall consistency of economic policies.
Flexible product and labor markets and the authorities’ determined adjustment policy have
laid the foundation for a robust export led recovery. Exporters have utilized fully the
turnaround in the world trade, and the robust activity in the Nordic countries and in the core
of the Eurozone. With domestic demand remaining still relatively subdued, the Estonian
economy grew by 5 percent y-o-y in the third quarter of 2010, at the second-fastest pace in
the European Union.
Competitiveness revisited
Swift restructuring in exporting industries through the process-optimization and improved
labor productivity has sharpened the competitive edge of the Estonian exporters; a
development mirrored in the decline of the unit labor costs. Exports growing 48 percent
y-o-y in November 2010 (including 49 percent to the EU markets), were highest on the
record, revealing a sustained competitive position. As staff’s analysis also demonstrates,
Estonia has advanced in non-price competitiveness, an important factor for income
convergence to continue.
The authorities view corporate restructuring driven competitiveness gains much more
profound than perceived improvements in competitiveness through nominal exchange rate
adjustments. The Estonian experience further proves that it is possible to reverse significant
loss in price competitiveness in a relatively short time period. Indeed, the Estonian exporters
have outperformed several competitors, which had exchange rate depreciation.
Anchoring inflation expectations
The authorities are mindful of short run inflation risks. With global food and energy prices on
the rise and the pass-though effects to the economy being relatively quick, the headline
inflation topped 5 percent in December 2010. However, core inflation has remained subdued
at around 1 percent, which is comparable with that in the Eurozone.

2
The authorities agree with the risks to the inflation outlook, but view the pick-up in inflation
as temporary, given the still high unemployment and the slack in the economy. The
authorities continue to monitor price developments closely, and among other anti-inflationary
measures, will promote stronger competition. Further, the euro induced price transparency
should exert downward pressures, particularly on consumer durables and wearing apparel.
Fiscal prudence is set to continue
Effective expenditure controls, stronger than expected growth performance, extra income
from the CO2 quota sales, and efficient tax collection yielded to only a modest deficit for
2010, which is estimated to be in the order of 1 percent of the GDP.
A return to fiscal sustainability was a standalone objective of the authorities, essential to
maintain investor confidence at home and abroad. Keeping the deficit below the 3 percent
Maastricht ceiling, made the Euro adoption possible. In their view, forceful fiscal
consolidation during the crisis did not harm the economic recovery. Quite the contrary, the
authorities used this opportunity to increase the efficiency of public finances through
streamlining the expenditure management and tax collection, while at the same time
preserving a social safety net and speeding up the use of the EU structural funds.
The authorities are committed to return to a fiscal surplus by 2013 and to restore the fiscal
reserves to a pre-crisis level. They see merit in more binding fiscal rules, including
expenditure ceilings, which are simple, transparent and easily enforceable. They intend to
implement changes to the fiscal framework alongside the revisions of the SGP framework.
Financial stability
The proactive use of macro-prudential policies in the run-up to the bubble paid off well
during the crisis. High capital and liquidity requirements served as an extra buffer for a
strong Nordic-owned banking sector, supporting both investor and customer confidence.
Proactive cross-border cooperation was equally relevant.
As the credit cycle has turned, the NPLs have peaked at 7.6 percent in August 2010, below
the authorities own estimate of 8.2 percent made in late 2009, and well below the mainstream
market estimates of a double-digit loan losses. With almost 80 percent of NPLs covered by
loan-loss provisions, cumulative loan losses with provisions from 2008 to 2010 have
amounted to below 6 percent of GDP. This is a remarkably low outturn given the size of the
output drop, and compares favorably to other countries that experienced the credit boom
before the crisis. The authorities see a very low likelihood of further pick-up in the NPLs.
Further, the banking sector has returned to a healthy profitability and the credit supply to the
economy is competitively priced. The Eurozone membership has reduced both the perceived
and actual risks to financial stability, in particular with respect to liquidity risks. That said,
the authorities concur with staff that there is scope to further enhance cross-border
cooperation and to fine-tune the crisis resolution framework. They are cognizant of any

3
residual domestic and global risks to financial stability and will utilize the most recent
experience gained at home and internationally to act preemptively.
Outlook and policy agenda for 2011 and beyond
The authorities expect the economy to grow close to 4 percent in 2011 and 2012, which
would imply that the economy will reach its pre-crisis output peak in 2012, an outturn few
believed in the not too distant past. Beyond this horizon, the authorities estimate the growth
potential to be in the order of 3–5 percent in the long run, sufficient to ensure continued
convergence in living standards.
Reducing high unemployment levels and boosting employment are among the authorities’
key priorities. Achieving an employment rate of 76 percent among the 20-64 age group, and
increasing the productivity per employed person to 80 percent of the EU average are two key
objectives in Estonia’s EU2020 strategy. To that end, the authorities aim to increase the
investments in human capital, including through higher spending on education, vocational
training and re-training, and the promotion of life-long learning. Population aging related
challenges underscore further the importance of an increased labor participation in all age
groups.
The authorities will focus on raising the international competitiveness of the R&D and
innovation environment, and on developing the institutions and infrastructure supporting
economic activities. They target an R&D investment level of 3 percent of the GDP, and aim
to increase Estonia’s share in the world trade to at least 0.11 percent by 2020.
In the field of environmentally friendly economy and energy, the authorities commit to
reducing greenhouse gas emissions in accordance with the EU commitments. They intend to
increase the share of renewable energy in the final energy consumption to 25% by 2020, and
maintain the final energy consumption at the 2010 level.
The Eurozone membership, a business friendly investment climate and the Nordic business
culture with a still significant labor-cost advantage, when compared with the Nordic
countries, make Estonia attractive for investment. With a continued prudence in policies, the
authorities see Estonia as well placed to meet upcoming challenges
