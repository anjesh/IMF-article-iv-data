STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
AND REQUEST FOR A THREE-YEAR ARRANGEMENT UNDER
THE EXTENDED CREDIT FACILITY

KEY ISSUES
Context. Against the background of challenging economic and social conditions,
Sierra Leone has been making progress since the end of the civil conflict in 2002. The
economy has been growing at a solid pace, inflation has been trending down, and sociopolitical stability is taking hold. Going forward, the authorities need to strengthen policy
implementation particularly in the fiscal area to entrench macroeconomic stability, support
private sector development and job creation, and develop social policies to protect the
most vulnerable groups in the population.
Consultation focus. Policy discussions focused on fiscal consolidation and public financial
management reforms; monetary policy and price stability; borrowing policies and long-term
debt sustainability; private sector development and structural reforms to enhance inclusive
growth.
Staff views. Staff recommends the approval of the authorities’ request for a three-year
arrangement under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) in an amount of SDR 62.22 million
(60 percent of quota). In May 2013, the authorities decided to cancel the three-year ECF
arrangement approved by the Board in June 2010 because key objectives under the
program supported by the arrangement were no longer achievable. The new arrangement
is aimed at supporting the authorities’ efforts to consolidate macroeconomic stability,
strengthen the fiscal position, build external buffers, and promote broad-based economic
growth in the context of their new Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS).
Safeguards assessment. The latest safeguards assessment was updated in 2010. The next
update will be completed by the time of the first review of the proposed ECF arrangement.
The new Poverty Reduction Strategy. The Joint IMF-World Bank Staff Advisory Note on
the new PRS will be circulated to the Board in early November.

BACKGROUND: TAKING STOCK
A Decade of Peace—Progress and Remaining Challenges
1.
Sierra Leone has made important strides in economic reconstruction and
macroeconomic as well as political stability since the end of the civil conflict in 2002. Economic
growth has been sustained and has strengthened in the last two years with the coming on stream of
iron ore production and increased infrastructure investment. Per capita GDP growth was slightly
above the 2.4 percent Sub-Saharan Africa average for 2003–11. Inflation, fuelled by expansionary
monetary and fiscal policies, currency depreciation, and global price shocks, has been in the doubledigits for most of the past decade. However, tighter monetary policy stance and increased food
supply in the last two years have helped contain inflationary pressures. The external current account
deficit deteriorated sharply in 2010–11 mainly because of the surge in FDI-financed imports
associated with iron ore investment; it narrowed in 2012 with the onset of iron ore exports (Text
Table 1). Since the end of the civil conflict, the socio-political situation has been stable, and three
peaceful rounds of elections have been held.

2.
While recent progress is laudable, fostering broad-based growth and reducing poverty
remain daunting challenges. Although in decline, the poverty headcount is above 50 percent.
Unemployment and underemployment are also high, and social indicators are weak by regional
standards. There are large infrastructure gaps, particularly for roads, energy, and access to safe water
and sanitation (Figure 1). Progress in institution building has been uneven, and administrative
capacity constraints remain important.
3.
The authorities have been addressing Sierra Leone’s developmental challenges within
the framework of poverty reduction strategies with donor support. They implemented two
generations of Poverty Reduction Strategies (PRS) during 2005–12, and have recently adopted a new
PRS, which aims to consolidate past progress and advance social and economic development in
2013–18. Donors have supported the authorities’ efforts through budget aid and technical
assistance (TA). In addition to TA, the IMF also provided policy advice and funding under

4

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SIERRA LEONE

ECF-supported programs. The authorities have generally been responsive to IMF policy advice and
built on TA recommendations to advance structural reforms and improve policy formulation (Box 1).

Lessons from the Last ECF-Supported Program
4.
Performance under the previous ECF-supported program (June 2010–June 2013) was
mixed. Macroeconomic stability improved, economic growth accelerated, and inflation declined
(Figure 2). Comprehensive structural and institutional reforms were completed to enhance revenue
collection as well as expenditure and treasury cash flow management, improve monetary operations
and banking sector supervision, and enhance the management of natural resources. However,
progress was limited in the fiscal area: the fiscal position weakened over time due to tension
between available resources and the scaling-up of infrastructure investment. While revenue
performance was in line with program objectives, expenditure overruns marked the three program
years (Box 2). The larger-than programmed deficits were financed with: (i) direct financing from the
Bank of Sierra Leone (BoSL) in 2010; (ii) unpaid bills to domestic suppliers in 2011 and;
(iii) over-borrowing from the government securities market, as well as accumulation of significant
unpaid bills to domestic suppliers in 2012. Corrective measures to reduce fiscal dominance and
address the slippages had a limited impact in the face of persistent weaknesses in public financial
management. The latter included: (i) weak coordination for budget preparation and low forecast
capacity; (ii) accommodation of in-year requests for additional spending; (iii) disaggregated
government accounts as well as low coordination between agencies and; (iv) absence of a public
investment plan integrated with a medium-term expenditure framework (MEFP ¶ 9–15).

Fund Advice

Response

Enhance the efficiency of revenue
collecting agencies and broaden
the tax base in order to create fiscal
space for infrastructure investment
and social services.

The authorities introduced structural reforms that have strengthened
efficiency at the National Revenue Agency (NRA). Key measures
include the setting up of: a Domestic Tax Department, the Large
Taxpayer office, the Medium Taxpayer office; and the increase in
penalties for noncompliance with tax obligations. They also
overhauled the tax system for the mining sector.

Contain non-priority spending
while striking a balance between
spending on infrastructure and
social services.

The authorities tightened expenditure commitment procedures to
improve non-priority spending monitoring and contain them to
budgeted levels. In this context, they set up a high-level inter-agency
Cash Management Committee; adopted regulations to guide public
investment execution, and prioritized spending on roads.

Eliminate fuel subsidies.

The authorities took action to substantially reduce implicit fuel
subsides in the form of foregone excises and road user charges. In
this context, they introduced a new fuel pricing mechanism.

Foster budget credibility and
predictability by strengthening the
medium-term expenditure
framework.

The preparation of a medium-term expenditure framework has
enhanced budget credibility, while the wider rollout of the Integrated
Financial Management Information System (IFMIS) has strengthened
the infrastructure for budget execution. The introduction of a
multi-year pay reform plan has set the stage for increasing capacity
in the civil service. Amendments to the Government Budgeting and
Accountability Act have helped clarify that only viable capital projects
should enter into the budget.

Limit monetization of the fiscal
deficit.

The Bank of Sierra Leone (BoSL) Act was amended to cap direct
credit to government at 5 percent of previous year’s revenue. The
authorities have complied with this measure since its introduction in
2011.

Increase effectiveness of monetary
policy and develop a yield curve.

The BoSL adopted the reverse repo rate as the benchmark interest
rate, which is announced regularly by the Monetary Policy
Committee.

Enhance the supervisory role of
BoSL and improve regulation and
supervision.

New off-site guidelines for surveillance were adopted and revised
prudential guidelines were issued.

Improve the information flow on
creditors and creditworthiness.

The authorities established a Credit Reference Bureau to provide
banks with information on the creditworthiness of prospective
customers.

SIERRA LEONE

Box 2. Sierra Leone: Budget Execution Under Severe Resource Constraints
Budget execution has faced important challenges in
recent years. Contributing factors are limited resources in
the face of expenditure pressures and weak public financial
management. As a result, spending in goods and services,
domestically financed investment and wages and salaries
have been systematically higher than budgeted,
compromising fiscal performance under the previous
ECF-supported program.
Low revenue base and declining budget support. Limited
gains on revenue performance set the stage for a tight fiscal
envelope in recent years, with revenue mobilization overly
dependent on exceptional collection from the mining sector
(iron ore) and oil exploration licenses. In addition, declining
budget support partially rooted in Sierra Leone’s graduation
from a post-conflict status added to the resource
constraints.
Limited access to domestic financing. Borrowing from the
government securities market is constrained by the narrow
investors’ base, its high cost (the 91-day interest rate was
24.5 percent in 2010), and prospects for crowding out credit
to the private sector. In addition, overdraft financing from
the BoSL was significantly reduced when the central bank
act was adopted by parliament in late 2011, limiting
government financing from BoSL to 5 percent of revenue in
the preceding year. This implied maximum financing from
BoSL equivalent to about 0.5 percent of GDP in fiscal year
2011 while actual BoSL financing reached 2.9 percent of
GDP in 2010.
Weak public financial management (PFM). Against the
background of administrative capacity constraints, in-year
requests for additional spending were not adequately
curbed in recent years, resulting in overspending. Although
the IFMIS supports expenditure controls for most line
ministries, lack of clarity under the Government Budget and
Accountability Act (2005) led to accommodation of
expenditures deemed to be of high urgency, particularly for
roads and other infrastructure projects.

Expenditure overruns and high cost of domestic debt. In
2010–12, on average, domestically financed investment, expenditure on goods and service, wages and salaries to
a lesser extent, were above the program targets by 55 percent, 20 percent, and 5 percent respectively. Key
contributing factors were: (i) higher than anticipated cost of running national elections in 2012; (ii) higher than
projected cost of the pay reform and the need to hire additional teachers, nurses, and police officers; and
(iii) faster execution rate for domestically financed investment that led to accelerated payment to projects
contractors. Financing the higher than budgeted fiscal deficit from the securities market has increased the
domestic debt burden with interest charges increasing from Le 142 billion (1.4 percent of non-iron ore GDP in
2010) to Le 256 billion (1.7 percent of non-iron ore GDP) in 2012.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND
SHORT-TERM OUTLOOK
5.
Economic growth surged in 2012 as large-scale iron ore mining production started
(Figure 3 and Table 1). The onset of iron ore production at two mines, and a strong performance in
agriculture, services, and construction boosted GDP growth to 15.2 percent in 2012, up from
6 percent in 2011. Growth is projected to average 13.7 percent in 2013–14, supported by the same
drivers and continued high public investment (MEFP ¶ 4).
6.
Inflationary pressures declined in 2012 and prospects for 2013 are encouraging. The
inflation rate stood at 12.1 percent (year-on-year) in 2012 (16.9 percent in 2011), supported by a
tight monetary policy stance, stability in the exchange rate, and increased food supply. The declining
trend in inflation has continued in 2013 as the authorities are restraining fiscal policy, and monetary
policy conditions have remained tight. The inflation rate (year-on-year) stood at 9.5 percent in July,
which augurs well for the end-year target (MEFP ¶ 5).
7.
The 2012 fiscal position was worse than anticipated (Tables 2a, 2b; and Figure 4). The
domestic primary deficit reached 3.8 percent of non-iron ore GDP, compared with 1.8 percent
budgeted, because of expenditure overruns. While revenue collection was slightly higher than
expected, expenditure was well above appropriation levels, mostly on account of spending related
to the November elections, and the authorities’ continued efforts to scale-up infrastructure
investment. The higher-than-budgeted deficit was partially financed with over-borrowing from the
government securities market and an accumulation of unpaid bills at the end of the year (MEFP ¶ 8).
8.
The external position improved in 2012 and is expected to strengthen further in 2013
(See Figure 3 and Table 5). The current account deficit dropped from 45 percent of non-iron ore
GDP in 2011 to 39.4 percent in 2012. The improvement reflects the sharp decline in investment-led
imports related to iron ore projects, the commencement of iron ore export, and favorable terms of
trade. Although the latter are expected to deteriorate in 2013, the current account deficit would
narrow further on account of the expected strong export performance. Sierra Leone’s reserve
coverage rose from 2.8 months of imports (excluding iron ore-related imports) in 2011 to
3.1 months in 2012. It is expected to stabilize around this level in 2013 (MEFP ¶ 6).
9.
Monetary and banking sector developments were broadly satisfactory in 2012, as risks
to financial sector stability appeared contained (Figure 5 and Tables 4 and 9). Broad money (M2)
grew by 23.1 percent, slightly faster than nominal non-iron ore GDP; and credit to the private sector
expanded by 6.3 percent, down from 21.8 percent in 2011, partly reflecting the impact of enhanced
banking supervision, and some crowding out from a sharp rise in government borrowing from the
securities market in 2012. Financial soundness indicators show that banks are generally well
capitalized, profitable, and in compliance with prudential regulations. They also point to an increase
in nonperforming loans, partly due to the high level of government unpaid bills to the private sector
at end-2012 (MEFP ¶ 7).

MEDIUM-TERM FRAMEWORK
10.
Reducing poverty and creating employment opportunities through sustained and
inclusive growth are two key objectives of the authorities’ medium-term policy framework.
Under their new development strategy for 2013–18, the authorities aim to reach these objectives by
strengthening the fiscal position, ensuring that economic policies support macroeconomic stability;
that structural reforms are put in place to improve the business environment; and that social
protection systems are developed for the most vulnerable groups of the population.
11.
The medium-term macroeconomic framework underpinning the ECF-supported
program being requested by the authorities is consistent with the new PRS. It points to a
favorable outlook with sustained growth, low inflation, and improving fiscal and external positions
(MEFP ¶ 27–30).


Growth prospects for 2014–18 are dominated by developments in the iron ore sector. Baseline
projections show that growth is expected to accelerate at a double-digit rate in the next two
years, and decelerate to 7.7 percent in 2016, consistent with the current iron ore production
profile (Text Table 2). Growth in the non-iron ore economy would remain robust (above
6 percent), supported by continued strong performance in agriculture. Mining activity is
expected to spillover into construction, manufacturing, and services—mainly trade and transport.
Staff stressed that continued infrastructure investment, and structural reforms to improve the
business environment will be needed to further enhance medium-term growth prospects in the
non-mineral economy.



The declining trend in inflation is expected to continue as the authorities are taking action to
improve the fiscal position and maintain a tight monetary policy stance. Measures taken by the

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

9

SIERRA LEONE

authorities in recent years to support agricultural production would also help contain food
inflation. The year-on-year inflation rate is forecast to be below 6 percent by 2016.


The external position would improve further in the medium term. The external current account
deficit is projected to narrow from 10.5 percent of non-iron ore GDP in 2014 to 7.2 percent in
2016, mostly because of strong export performance; helping improve the reserve coverage to
3.9 months of imports.

12.
The economic outlook is subject to downside risks. Domestically, there are uncertainties
regarding iron ore production, as the largest mine had a difficult start in 2012, with actual
production much lower than anticipated. Key external risk factors include a potential slowdown in
global demand for Sierra Leone’s main exports, adverse terms of trade shocks, and a shortfall in
projected budget aid. Lower exports as well as higher cost for imported fuel would heighten
vulnerabilities for the government budget and for the balance of payments. Similarly, a shortfall in
budget aid would hinder budget execution and may lead to excessive borrowing from the securities
market (Table 11—Risk Assessment Matrix).

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
13.
Policy discussions focused on: improving the fiscal position, reducing inflation to
single-digits, maintaining prudent borrowing policies, promoting private sector development, and
supporting growth inclusiveness.

A. Fiscal Policy and Reforms
14.
The authorities’ medium-term fiscal strategy aims to improve the fiscal position to
support macroeconomic stability and long-term debt sustainability (MEFP ¶ 31–37). To this
effect, the authorities plan to:


Strengthen revenue mobilization. Key measures include: (i) improve IT systems at the NRA to
increase auditing capacity and enhance monitor for compliance with tax obligations; (ii) set up a
specialized unit for taxation of extractive industries; (iii) implement the small-taxpayer regime;
and (iv) review and rationalize the tax exemption system.



Enhance natural resource revenue management. The authorities have prepared, with support
from the IMF Fiscal Affairs Department (FAD) TA, a new fiscal regime for the resource sector
(Extractive Industries Revenue Imposition Act) that will be introduced in parliament before the
end of the year. The new regime would bring under one legal instrument tax and non-tax rules
for the extractive industries, and introduce a resource rent tax levied against windfall profits.



Restrain expenditure and improve spending commitment controls. After several years of
expenditure overruns, the authorities are taking steps to restore fiscal discipline and tighten
expenditure commitment controls. They are preparing a medium-term expenditure framework
(MTEF) incorporating a three-year rolling public investment program starting in 2014, to guide
the implementation of the new PRS. Infrastructure investment and other pro-poor spending will

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SIERRA LEONE

remain important priorities, while growth in spending in goods and services, as well as wages
and salaries will decelerate in the medium term. In particular, the implementation of the pay
reform plan will be better controlled with improved forecasting capacity for the wage bill,
resulting in an average increase of 16 percent for wages and salaries during 2013–16, well below
the 26 percent rise in 2011–12. Staff stressed that continued expenditure restraint is warranted
because of the low revenue base and continued financing constraints.


Reduce domestic debt. Following a significant build-up in domestic debt in recent years, partly to
finance infrastructure projects, the medium-term fiscal strategy anticipates a decline in the stock
of domestic debt over time, and a lengthening of maturity starting in 2013, in line with the
Medium-Term Debt Management Strategy. On this basis, interests on domestic debt are
projected to decline from 1.7 percent of non-iron ore GDP in 2012 to 1.4 percent in 2016.



Accelerate PFM reforms. The authorities agreed with staff that addressing weaknesses in budget
processes and expenditure management was critically important for the programmed fiscal
objectives. They have prepared a medium-term PFM reform strategy to be adopted by Cabinet
in the coming weeks, focusing on budget comprehensiveness and credibility, accountability, and
revenue mobilization (Box 3). Staff encouraged the authorities to prepare an action plan for the
implementation of the strategy, and stressed that actions taken in 2012 to enhance coordination
between fiscal and monetary policies through the operations of the Cash Management
Committee have been productive and should be enhanced further with the participation of all
stakeholders.

15.
The authorities expect that implementation of the measures presented above will
improve the fiscal position over the medium term. Revenue is projected to increase from
12.4 percent of non-iron ore GDP in 2014 to almost 13.4 percent in 2016, while expenditure would
stabilize around 20.5 percent of non-iron ore GDP during the same period, with an increase in
pro-poor and capital spending. Hence, after an initial increase to 2.3 percent of non-iron ore GDP in
2014 on account of a pick-up in domestically financed investment, the domestic primary deficit
would narrow to 1.9 percent of non-iron ore GDP by 2016 (Figure 6). Building on recommendations
from FAD TA, the authorities are preparing a PFM bill for the adoption of a fiscal rule based on a
non-resource fiscal balance (MEFP ¶ 38). Staff noted that progress in this area will help the
authorities prepare for the advent of increased revenue from iron ore in the medium to long term.
16.
The revised 2013 budget approved by parliament in July calls for a significant
tightening of fiscal policy. The domestic primary deficit is projected to drop from 3.8 percent of
non-iron ore GDP in 2012 to 1.8 percent (see Table 2b). Although revenue collection efforts will be
intensified, total revenue would increase only marginally. Hence, the anticipated fiscal consolidation
efforts rest on expenditure restraint. Current expenditure and domestically financed investment
combined are projected to decline by almost 2 percentage points of non-iron ore GDP compared
with 2012, reflecting the unwinding of one-off election-related outlays, and the authorities’ decision
to limit domestically financed investment to ongoing projects.
17.
The 2013 fiscal program is fully financed, and financing prospects for the remainder of
the program period are positive. The main financing sources are: external budget aid, bonds and

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

SIERRA LEONE

T-bills issuance in the securities market, and statutory overdraft facility at BoSL, which is limited at
5 percent of previous year’s government revenue. Fiscal policy would be anchored by a level of bank
and nonbank financing not exceeding 2 percent of non-iron ore GDP, with the aim of achieving a
reduction in the ratio of domestic debt to non-iron ore GDP over the medium term. Staff stressed
that achieving the 2013 fiscal targets would require that fiscal discipline be restored to avoid any
accumulation of unpaid bills in 2013, and enhance fiscal policy credibility. In this context, there was
an agreement that domestically financed investment be scaled back in the event of revenue shortfall,
or if expected donor support should be lower than the expected 1.8 percent of non-iron ore GDP
(MEFP ¶ 33).
18.
The authorities stressed that restoring fiscal discipline is their most important goal for
2013. While agreeing with staff that there are important challenges for fiscal policy implementation,
they indicated that measures taken in early 2013, including enhanced review of spending in line
ministries, improved monitoring of NRA revenue transit accounts in commercial banks, and a better
follow up on collection of taxes on petroleum products would support the attainment of
programmed fiscal objectives. The authorities indicated that to avoid over spending, they have
decided to limit investment projects execution in 2013 to ongoing projects initiated in 2012, and to
complete all expenditure commitments earlier than in previous years (MEFP ¶ 36).

Box 3. Sierra Leone: Public Financial Management Reform Strategy for 2014–17
The authorities’ medium term strategy to advance Public Financial Management (PFM) reforms focuses on
budget planning, comprehensiveness and credibility (including at the local level), financial accountability,
service delivery and oversight, and revenue mobilization. The strategy stresses that enhanced revenue
mobilization and effective investment spending controls are essential for the efficient implementation of the
new PRS. Key structural measures under the strategy, some of which are part of structural reforms under the
economic program for 2013–14 are presented below.


A new PFM Bill. Submit to parliament the new PFM Bill that includes amendments and clarifications on
supplementary budgets and contingency funds.



Extend the use of IFMIS. Set up an Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS)
performance budgeting module to ensure that all fiscal operations and public accounts are covered
under IFMIS and implement IFMIS functionality for all expenditure commitment and control; activate
commitment accounting under IFMIS as part of a comprehensive plan to improve forecasting and
procedures for budget adjustments within the year; and complete the roll-out of IFMIS to all major
spending line ministries. These measures would facilitate timely and high-quality fiscal accounting,
reporting, and audits.



Build administrative capacity. Expand revenue and expenditure forecasting capacity at all levels.



Enhance cash management. Establish a Treasury Single Account (TSA), and streamline NRA’s transition
accounts held in deposit money banks (DMBs) for revenue collection. In this context, the National
Revenue Authority (NRA) signed a memorandum of understanding with DMBs setting up time limit for
the transfer of collected revenue to the Treasury’s account at the Bank of Sierra Leone.



Improve capital spending management. Complete a three-year Public Investment Plan (PIP), fully
integrated with the budget process and the revised Medium Term Expenditure Framework for
2015–18, and set up a PIP unit at the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development (MoFED).



Strengthen public procurement. Adopt the New Public Procurement Act, harmonized with the
Procurement Manual, and establish a Directorate for procurement at the MoFED.



Adopt a new tax regime for the mining sector. Submit to parliament the Extractive Industries
Revenue Bill; including a resource rent tax and a resource revenue administration unit at NRA.

B. Monetary Policy and Financial Sector Issues
19.
Monetary policy should continue to support a decline in inflation. In the first half of
2013, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) reduced the monetary policy rate (MPR) twice, to
realign it with lower interest rates in the government securities market. Although price pressures
eased further during the same period, staff took the view that BoSL should maintain a tight
monetary policy stance through the use of the MPR to contain liquidity in line with the programmed
single-digit inflation target for 2013. Hence, the MPC should stand ready to raise the MPR to mop
up excess liquidity should inflationary pressures reemerge. The BoSL will continue to develop its
monetary policy tools and liquidity forecasting capacity to be more active in the money market and
use repo instruments to achieve liquidity targets, while contributing to the development of the
securities market. Staff stressed that continued information sharing between the BoSL and the
Ministry of Finance remains critically important, notably for liquidity forecasting purposes
(MEFP ¶ 39–40).
20.
The BoSL concurred with staff that although trending down, inflation remained
elevated. Therefore, easing monetary policy conditions would not be appropriate. In this regard, the
BoSL noted that the MPR had started to be an efficient signaling tool for monetary policy stance. It
also noted that the recent conversion of non-marketable and non-interest bearing securities into
marketable instruments had strengthened its ability to mop up liquidity, should the need arise. The
BoSL indicated that supply shocks play an important role in price pressures. Therefore, prospects for
good harvests in 2013 would help in reducing food inflation further. BoSL reaffirmed commitment to
complying with the statutory limit on budget financing by the central bank to 5 percent of the
previous year’s revenue.
21.
Sierra Leone’s financial sector has expanded significantly in recent years, but it remains
relatively small (Annex II). It comprises deposit money banks, insurance companies, a pension fund,
and a stock exchange. Banks represent over 80 percent of the financial system, with the two largest
ones accounting for 38 percent of assets and about 46.5 percent of credit to the economy. The
number of banks increased from 8 in 2006 to 13 in 2012, and their networks have also expanded.
22.
Despite the fast growth in the banking system, access to financial services remains
limited (Figure 7). Financial intermediation has grown steadily since the end of the civil conflict.
However, it is building from a low base, and the financial sector development lags peer countries.
World Bank data indicates that there are roughly three bank branches per 100,000 persons; only 19
percent of the population holds a bank account; and only 1 percent of the population holds a loan
from the banking system. Key factors hindering access to financial services include: lack of sound
collateral, weaknesses in the legal system, the low level of household income, and the short term
nature of banks’ liabilities.
23.
Financial soundness indicators suggest that the banking sector is generally well
capitalized and liquid, with limited vulnerabilities. Capital adequacy ratios are generally well
above the statutory limit for most banks. Credit quality has improved as NPLs halved since 2007, but
their level remains elevated at 14.7 percent at end-2012 (see Table 9). Banks’ income has increased
14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SIERRA LEONE

in recent years, although it is increasingly dependent on the spread between deposits and
government securities. Liquidity ratios are generally high as private sector lending remains limited.
24.
BoSL has made good progress toward building supervisory capacity and putting in
place the necessary components of a modern financial system. A Financial Sector Development
Plan was adopted in 2009 and is being implemented; the BoSL and Banking Acts have been revised
to strengthen compliance with the aim of eventually adopting Basel Core Principles; prudential bank
guidelines have been drafted; a benchmark policy rate has been introduced to improve monetary
policy signaling; and a credit reference bureau was established in 2011. While welcoming these
improvements, staff encouraged BoSL to continue building on TA recommendations to address
remaining gaps in banking supervision, monetary and foreign exchange operations, and
administrative capacity.
25.
BoSL continues to give a special emphasis on access to finance. It is actively supporting
initiatives to encourage the development of microfinance in rural areas and credit facilities for smalland medium-sized enterprises, with support from donors. It is also developing a financial literacy
campaign.

C. Supporting Long-Term Debt Sustainability
26.
The updated Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) indicates that Sierra Leone remains at
a moderate risk of debt distress (Figure 8).1 Under the baseline scenario, all debt indicators are
expected to remain below their policy-dependent indicative thresholds during the projection
period (2013–33). However, stress tests point to vulnerability to adverse shocks affecting key
macroeconomic indicators. Staff reiterated that to contain the risk of debt distress and support
long-term debt sustainability, it was critical for the authorities to: (i) maintain prudent borrowing
policies, seeking mainly grants and concessional loans; (ii) sustain fiscal consolidation efforts;
(iii) continue implementation of growth-enhancing structural reforms; and (iv) promote economic
diversification.
27.
Staff also called for strengthened debt management capacity. It welcomed progress in
the preparation of the Medium-Term Debt Strategy (MTDS), scheduled for Cabinet adoption by
end-December 2013 (MEFP ¶ 45, 46). Staff stressed that improving debt management capacity is
increasingly critical in light of the country’s access to nonconcessional borrowing (see below).
28.
The proposed ECF-supported program provides for non concessional borrowing (NCB).
The projected stock of external debt under the DSA includes US$30 million (0.6 percent of GDP),
per year, during the program period, that could be contracted on nonconcessional terms. Staff
stressed that borrowing on nonconcessional terms should be considered after ensuring that: (i) all
avenues for mobilizing concessional financing have been exhausted; (ii) the new nonconcessional
borrowing should not increase Sierra Leone’s risk of debt distress; and (iii) the selected projects are

SIERRA LEONE

integrated in a three-year public investment program aligned with the new PRS, and assessed by a
reputable third party as being economically viable. For the first program year (2013–14), the NCB
would cover the construction of two mini hydroelectric dams in rural areas (MEFP ¶ 45).
29.
Staff advised the authorities to ensure that projects assessed as economically viable
should be financed to the maximum extent possible through concessional resources. It insisted
that prior to contracting external loans, associated projects should be included in the rolling
three-year Public Investment Plan, well prioritized to take into account financing constraints, and
assessed as economically and financially viable. On the specific case of the new airport project
(See below ¶ 38), staff advised that the authorities carry out a feasibility study, with support from the
World Bank, and assess the project’s macroeconomic impact. Staff also recommended that the
authorities evaluate financing options and seek to secure concessional financing for the airport. The
authorities agreed to provide staff with available documentation on the airport and other large
infrastructure projects under consideration, to inform staff analysis on their macroeconomic impact.
30.
The authorities appreciated the added flexibility on external borrowing terms. They
stressed that increased difficulty in obtaining improvement in proposed loan terms to meet the
35 percent concessionality threshold for external borrowing specified in the program hampered the
implementation of some economically viable and socially important projects, and partially led to
increased borrowing in the securities market in the last few years. They agreed with staff, however,
that in view of the economy’s vulnerability to terms of trade and other exogenous shocks, and the
narrow export base, they will continue to seek mainly grants and concessional loans, and limit
nonconcessional borrowing to economically viable projects for which softer loan terms could not be
secured.

D. Enhancing Competitiveness and External Stability
31.
Sierra Leone’s exchange rate system is classified as floating, with the value of the leone
determined by the market. The central bank’s interventions are limited and aimed at smoothing
volatility in the market. Building on TA recommendations from MCM, Staff urged BoSL to introduce a
wholesale foreign exchange auction system to replace the current retail auction system available to
some importers. The new system will be introduced in mid-2014 (MEFP ¶ 41). The authorities are
working on an amendment to the Foreign Exchange Act, which aims to update existing legislation,
building on TA recommendations from IMF staff.
32.
Staff estimates that Sierra Leone’s real effective exchange rate (REER) is broadly in line
with macroeconomic fundamentals. While the nominal effective exchange rate was relatively
stable during 2010–12, the REER appreciated by about 9 percent reflecting inflation differential with
Sierra Leone’s major trading partners. Results from the standard Consultative Group on Exchange
Rate (CGER) methodologies suggest that there was no significant misalignment. The external
sustainability approach points to 3.5 percent overvaluation, while the macroeconomic balance and
the equilibrium exchange rate approaches indicate an undervaluation in the range of 4–6 percent
(Annex I).

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SIERRA LEONE

33.
Increasing reserve coverage should remain a priority for the medium term, in light of
Sierra Leone’s vulnerability to shocks. At end-2012, international reserves stood at 3.1 months of
imports,2 lower than the average for SSA countries under ECF-supported programs. Staff analysis
indicates that an optimal level of reserve coverage for Sierra Leone would be in the 3–6 months of
imports range, taking into account that Sierra Leone is a small open-economy susceptible to external
shocks (See Annex I). However, staff argued that given the country’s large need for infrastructure
investment, the opportunity cost of holding reserves is relatively high for Sierra Leone, supporting a
target level of reserves closer to 4 months of prospective imports.
34.
Important structural factors continue to hinder competitiveness despite some progress
in recent years. Sierra Leone improved its position on the Ease of Doing Business indicators, and its
ranking in 2013 advanced by ten places (Figure 9). However, further structural reforms are needed to
address key structural factors contributing to high transactions costs in Sierra Leone, including
inadequate infrastructure, limited availability of skilled labor force, insufficient energy supply and
high transportation and communication costs. Therefore, staff welcomed the authorities’ resolve to
accelerate structural reforms to address these impediments to private sector development
(MEFP ¶ 47). It also encouraged them to strengthen the framework for Anti-Money Laundering and
Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT), notably through the setting up of an independent Financial
Intelligence Unit in line with recommendations from the Intergovernmental Action Group against
Money Laundering in West Africa.
35.
The authorities agreed with staff’s external stability assessment for Sierra Leone. They
noted that there was a marginal appreciation of the REER in 2012, but agreed there was no evidence
of exchange rate misalignment that could result in future external instability. On reserve adequacy,
the BoSL did not see the need for higher international reserve accumulation at this time. They
emphasized that a temporary increase in mining-related imports had driven the decline in gross
reserves, which will reverse as the mining projects begin to generate foreign exchange inflows.
Nonetheless, the authorities are aware of the risk of Dutch disease for Sierra Leone over the medium
term, with the expected expansion in the mining sector. Therefore, they have identified economic
diversification as one of the key objectives under the new PRS (MEFP ¶ 16–18). They also plan to
intensify initiatives aimed at supporting agricultural development, through inputs provision,
improved extension services, and skills development through the setting up of new Agricultural
Business Centers.

E. Promoting Inclusive Growth
36.
The authorities have reviewed policy performance relative to the objectives set out in
the previous PRS in preparing key pillars of the new strategy. They recognize that progress in
attaining the Millennium Development Goals, particularly in health and education has been sluggish
(Figure 10). At the same time, taming unemployment and reducing income inequality continue to
feature prominently among the government’s developmental priorities. Hence the new PRS recently
2

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

SIERRA LEONE

launched by the government focuses on eight key pillars—(i) economic diversification and inclusive
growth; (ii) managing natural resource wealth; (iii) accelerating human development; (iv) improving
competitiveness; (v) employment and labor strategy; (vi) social protection; (vii) governance and
public sector reform; and (viii) gender and women empowerment (MEFP ¶ 16–26).
37.
The authorities recognized the challenges in making progress towards inclusive growth
in a stable macroeconomic environment. Under the new PRS, they plan to focus on measures to
advance economic diversification, improve access to education and health services, strengthen social
protection, empower women, and increase employment opportunities (Annex III).
38.
To achieve the economic transformation expected from the new PRS, the authorities
plan to implement a number of large-scale projects in agriculture, energy and transportation.
The envisaged projects include irrigation and rice production to continue supporting agricultural
supply and employment, the construction of hydro electric plants to increase power production by
an estimated 475 Mega Watts, and the construction of a new airport in the mainland. The cost of the
airport project is estimated at US$312 million (6.6 percent of 2013 GDP); the authorities informed
staff that preparatory work to identify financing has already started (MEFP ¶ 21).
39.
The authorities concurred with staff’s analysis and policy recommendations on
inclusive growth. They explained that addressing infrastructure gaps in energy, telecommunication,
and water supply are key priorities for poverty reduction under the new PRS. The authorities view the
implementation of the Agenda for Prosperity as the main organizing principle for discussions of
medium-term fiscal sustainability. They see the transition to a resource dependent economy as a
prerequisite for economic and social progress. However, they expressed concerns about the
financing of the new PRS, notably for large-scale infrastructure projects in the energy and
transportation sectors.

F. Other Surveillance Issues
40.
Data provision quality. Data provision is adequate for surveillance purposes despite
shortcomings. There has been some progress in data quality and timeliness in the last few years,
partly thanks to technical assistance from the IMF and other donors. Further improvements are
needed for balance of payments and international investment position statistics, government finance
statistics, and social indicators. In addition, with the advent of iron ore production, it has become
urgent to develop adequate statistical tools for the proper accounting of activities in the natural
resources sector.
41.
Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). While some progress has been made
in recent years, Sierra Leone has yet to achieve EITI-compliant status. Its candidacy was accepted in
February 2008 and renewed in July 2011. It is currently on hold as the authorities are working
towards the conclusion of the validation exercise aimed at addressing discrepancies uncovered by
successive reconciliation reports.

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SIERRA LEONE

PROGRAM ISSUES
42.
The authorities decided to cancel the ECF arrangement approved by the Board in
June 2010, and to request a new IMF-supported program. Following four successful reviews, the
authorities believed that key objectives under the program, particularly in the fiscal area, were no
longer realistic or achievable. In late May, they informed staff of their decision to request a new
medium-term arrangement that would provide a sounder framework for the implementation of
needed reforms. They are, therefore, requesting a new ECF arrangement for 2013–16, to consolidate
recent progress in macroeconomic stabilization, strengthen the fiscal position and the management
of public resources, build external buffers, and advance structural reforms to boost inclusive growth,
in line with key objectives under the new PRS.
43.
Staff proposes an access level equivalent to 60 percent of quota (SDR 62.22 million).
This level is based on the strength of the adjustment under the proposed program, and the country’s
vulnerabilities. As a small open economy driven by exports of minerals and dependent on oil and
food imports, Sierra Leone is vulnerable to fluctuations in global commodity and food prices, which
generate protracted balance of payments needs. Fund disbursements under the proposed program
will help cover financing requirements for 2013–16 and improve the reserve coverage from
3.1 months of imports in 2012, to 3.9 months in 2016. It will also play an important catalytic role for
much needed donor support for Sierra Leone. Total Fund credit will amount to 103 percent of quota
at the end of the proposed program period. Donors have committed to continue supporting reform
implementation in Sierra Leone, with a focus on public financial management, tax administration,
and management of natural resources. Their financial support is projected at US$264 million for
2013–16 (Tables 9 and 10).
44.
Sierra Leone’s capacity to meet its obligations to the Fund is adequate. Debt service to
the Fund is projected to increase from 0.4 percent of exports of goods and services in 2014 to
0.6 percent at the end of the arrangement; and from 1.5 percent of gross international reserves to
2.7 percent during the same period (See Table 9). In addition, Sierra Leone has established a good
record of timely payment of external debt obligations, including to the Fund. The strong level of
donor support combined with Sierra Leone’s favorable medium-term export prospects would also
strengthen Sierra Leone’s capacity to discharge its external debt obligations, including to the Fund.
45.
Consistent with IMF policy on lending into arrears, Staff has determined that the
proposed ECF-supported program will provide an essential support to the implementation of
Sierra Leone’s economic and financial program for 2013–16, as discussed above, including for
the resolution of arrears to private creditors, accumulated before and during the civil war, totaling
US$221 million at end–2012. The government has maintained prudent borrowing policies, and has
not accumulated arrears on external debt since the beginning of engagement with the IMF under
ECF-supported programs. In addition, it has been making good faith efforts to reach collaborative
agreement with its creditors, including goodwill payments to avoid litigation, and working with the
World Bank to access the IDA debt-buy-back program. A road map to fast track the process has
been agreed upon and preparatory work would be initiated in coming months.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

SIERRA LEONE

46.
Program performance will be assessed through semi-annual reviews. The reviews will be
based on macro-critical prior actions for the first year of the program; quantitative performance
criteria, indicative targets, and structural benchmarks. For the purpose of these reviews, the program
sets quantitative performance criteria for end-December 2013, end-June 2014 and end-December
2014; and indicative targets for end-March and end-September 2014. The first and second reviews
will assess program performance at end-December 2013 and end-June 2014 respectively, and the
third review will cover performance at end-December 2014. To set fiscal policy implementation on a
sound footing and prevent the reoccurrence of slippages, the program sets two prior actions: (i) the
submission to parliament of a supplementary budget consistent with program objectives; and (ii) the
preparation of a budget execution report on capital expenditure at end-June 2013. This, combined
with other programmed PFM measures aimed at controlling spending commitments, would help the
authorities ensure that capital expenditure execution is consistent with budgetary appropriations.
47.
An update safeguards assessment of the BoSL will be carried out by the first ECF
review. The latest safeguards assessment was completed on November 24, 2010. It concluded that
the BoSL continues to maintain important elements of the safeguards framework. Since the
assessment, BoSL has been addressing identified weaknesses in internal audit through training and
recruitment.
48.
Program implementation is subject to downside risks. Key risks to the economic outlook
discussed in paragraph 12 above would also adversely affect program performance if they
materialize. In addition, the authorities’ ability to restore fiscal discipline and break away from past
practices in budget execution will be critically important for the achievement of programmed fiscal
targets.
49.
Policy coordination needs further improvement. The close monitoring of fiscal operations
under the Cash Management Committee has been instrumental in addressing past fiscal slippages
and improving coordination between fiscal and monetary policy. Staff urged the authorities to
enhance policy coordination further through capacity building initiatives, including training, further
TA, and enhanced information sharing among government agencies. The successful implementation
of the program would also depend on progress in this area.

STAFF APPRAISAL
50.
Sierra Leone achieved strong macroeconomic gains in the last decade. Agriculture,
construction, services, and iron ore more recently, have been the main contributors to sustained
economic growth. Large-scale FDI inflows in the mining sector added a temporary growth surge in
construction and other services; while the scaling-up of infrastructure investment in the last three
years supported economic activity in the non-mining economy. The medium-term outlook is positive
with continued strong growth, declining inflation and robust external position.
51.
Staff urges the authorities to strengthen fiscal discipline. Staff welcomes the authorities’
efforts to boost revenue mobilization and create fiscal space for priority spending, and encourages
them to increase efficiency in revenue collecting agencies through administrative measures, and to
broaden the tax base to reach the revenue targets. Staff urges the authorities to strengthen budget
execution procedures, particularly for the monitoring of spending commitments and for the
20

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SIERRA LEONE

management of capital expenditure, in the context of their medium-term PFM reform strategy. Staff
believes that PFM reforms planned for 2014–17 are appropriately ambitious given existing
administrative capacity constraints. It stresses the need for an efficient and timely implementation of
envisioned reforms to enhance fiscal policy credibility and support macroeconomic stability.
52.
Staff believes that a continued tight monetary policy stance is needed to lower
inflation expectations further. The trend decline in inflation since mid-2011 is starting to form
inflation expectations and should be supported by continued tight monetary policy to support the
single-digit inflation target. Staff encourages the BoSL to continue its ongoing efforts to improve
liquidity forecasting and enhance monetary operations.
53.
The debt sustainability analysis (DSA) shows that the risk of debt distress remains
moderate. All debt indicators remain below the policy-dependent thresholds under the baseline
scenario. The debt outlook is, however, vulnerable to shocks affecting revenue and export, as well as
unfavorable borrowing conditions. The DSA also indicates that limited external borrowing on
nonconcessional terms for priority investment in infrastructure is consistent with the medium- to
long-term debt sustainability. However, staff recommends that the authorities continue to cover
financing needs mostly with grants and concessional loans, particularly for large-scale infrastructure
projects under the new PRS (Agenda for Prosperity). Staff urges the authorities to ensure that before
proceeding with such projects, they are well prioritized, assessed as economically viable, and
consistent with external debt sustainability.
54.
Staff supports the authorities request for a three-year arrangement under the ECF,
with access level of 60 percent of quota. The new program will help the authorities enhance
macroeconomic stability and growth prospects. The program is appropriately ambitious, particularly
in the fiscal area. This, combined with Sierra Leone’s balance of payments needs and its adequate
capacity to discharge external debt obligations, justifies the proposed access level.
55.
Staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation with Sierra Leone takes place in
accordance with the 2010 Decision on consultation cycles for program countries.

1 As pointed out in an independent evaluation of the Doing Business survey (see www.worldbank.org/ieg/doingbusiness), care should be exercised when
interpreting these indicators given subjective interpretation, limited coverage of business constraints, and a small number of informants which tend to overstate the
indicators' coverage and explanatory power.

1/ The commencement of iron ore mining causes a structural break in key macroeconomic variables in 2012.
2/ Refers to reserves in current year and imports in following year.
3/ Excludes import of capital goods and service related to the iron ore project that is externally financed.
4/ Revenue less expenditures and net lending adjusted for interest payments.
5/ Statistics Sierra Leone revised the National Accounts Statistics, based on IMF TA recommendations.
This resulted in approximately a 30 percent increase in nominal GDP for the period 2001-11.

Impact and Policy Response
Low to Medium
A sustained decline in commodity prices would result in a higher
external current account deficit and a shortfall in government revenue
from the mining sector. It could also delay expected investment in iron
ore production expansion.
Policy response: Delay scaling up of public investment and strengthen
efficiency in non-resource revenue mobilization.
Low to Medium
A lower-than projected iron ore production would result in a shortfall
in revenue from iron ore royalties, lower growth, and higher external
current account.
Policy response: Same as for a “sustained decline in commodity prices.”
Medium
As was the case in 2011–12, a sharp rise in the world oil price is not
likely to be passed through to domestic consumers, as Sierra Leone
lacks social safety nets to mitigate the impact of higher prices on
vulnerable groups. The budget would absorb the cost, likely resulting
in lower domestic investment or higher borrowing from the securities
market.
Policy response: Gradual pass-through of higher global prices
combined with social safety nets measures for the most vulnerable
groups; and lower domestically-financed investment.
Medium
A shortfall in aid would compromise the anticipated fiscal
consolidation efforts. It may result in postponement of domestic
investment, and lead to increased borrowing from the securities
market that could potentially crowd out of private sector borrowing.
Policy response: Ensure strong implementation of donors’
disbursement conditions for committed aid, and scale back
domestically financed investment.
Medium
A higher than anticipated fiscal deficit would lead to increased
borrowing from the securities market and an accumulation of domestic
arrears, with adverse impact for the monetary program and the
financial sector.
Policy response: Continue close monitoring of budget execution, and
stop nonwage expenditure commitments two months prior to the end
of the fiscal year.

Appendix I. Letter of Intent
October 1, 2013
Madame Christine Lagarde
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431
USA
Dear Madame Lagarde:
1.
On behalf of the government of Sierra Leone, I am pleased to submit herewith a
Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) for which Sierra Leone is requesting a
three-year arrangement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) under the Extended Credit
Facility (ECF) for the period 2013–16. The objectives of the program and measures envisaged for
achieving them are described in the memorandum. Reflecting the government’s poverty reduction
and growth objectives, the program focuses on (i) consolidating the gains from the previous
ECF-supported program, including macroeconomic stability supported by prudent fiscal and
monetary policies; (ii) strengthening revenue performance and improving public financial
management to efficiently channel adequate resources to infrastructure and poverty-reducing
spending; and (iii) stepping up financial sector reforms to support financial deepening and economic
growth.
2.
The government requests that the MEFP be supported under a three-year arrangement
under the ECF in an amount equivalent to SDR 62.22 million (or 60 percent of quota). We also
request that the first disbursement, in an amount equivalent to SDR 8.89 million, be made available
after approval of the ECF arrangement by the Executive Board of the IMF. To monitor progress in
implementing our reform agenda, the program includes a set of quantitative criteria, indicative
targets, and structural benchmarks outlined in the MEFP and the Technical Memorandum of
Understanding (TMU).
3.
Sierra Leone’s new poverty reduction strategy for 2013–18 (PRSP III) launched in July this
year—The Agenda for Prosperity—focuses on addressing the infrastructure deficit and growing the
private sector to support inclusive growth, enhancing the efficiency and access to social services to
support human development, and improving governance and transparency to support effective
public service delivery. Development partners, in accordance with the Busan principles of aid
effectiveness, have pledged to assist the government to attain these broad objectives.
4.
To help achieve the objectives of the Agenda for Prosperity, the government plans to
implement a number of transformational investment projects, including a new airport on the
mainland, hydro electric dams, and agriculture irrigation projects. The government will seek
concessional borrowing for these transformational projects. The government believes, in particular,
that the construction of a new airport will support private sector development and economic growth,
increase tourism, and generate new sources of revenue for the government budget. The government
44

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SIERRA LEONE

will pursue the project if it is economically viable. It will work closely with Sierra Leone’s development
partners, notably the World Bank on the project’s feasibility and with IMF staff on its macroeconomic
and program implications.
5.
The government of Sierra Leone has made substantial progress during 2001–13 in laying the
foundations for macroeconomic stability, sustained economic growth, and financial sector expansion
in the context of three previous programs. The previous ECF-supported program for 2010–13 had to
be cancelled to enable the newly elected government to take stock of progress in strengthening
institutions, including procedures for public financial management, and to transition to a new
economic program that would support the Agenda for Prosperity. Nonetheless, reform measures and
policies put in place have helped improve macroeconomic stability, advance social policies, and
enhance prospects for broad-based and inclusive economic growth. This progress demonstrates the
government’s commitment to meet performance criteria and structural benchmarks set for 2013–14
(MEFP, Tables 1–2).
6.
The economic outlook for the rest of this year and over the medium term remains favorable.
We expect to use prudent fiscal and monetary policies to dampen inflationary pressures—consumer
price inflation fell to 9.5 percent (year-on-year) at end-July, the first time since the onset of the
global financial crisis, and interest rates on government securities declined considerably, from
19–26 percent at end-2012 to 3–9 percent in late August, reflecting tight expenditure management
in the first half of the year, with limited issuance of short-term securities. As a result, the Monetary
Policy Committee of the Bank of Sierra Leone (BoSL) reduced the monetary policy interest rate.
Going forward, any further declines in the monetary policy rate (MPR) would be carefully calibrated
in line with the use of other monetary instruments to support the single-digit inflation target while
encouraging financial intermediation. We expect a careful execution of government spending, in the
context of the cash management committee and envisaged further improvements in public financial
management, to help alleviate infrastructure bottlenecks, enhance the business environment for job
creation, and maintain macroeconomic stability. Nonetheless, the global economic outlook presents
risks to the economic outlook that call for vigilance in policy implementation. We stand ready to take
corrective measures should adverse shocks materialize and compromise the attainment of
programmed objectives.
7.
Sierra Leone believes that the policies set forth in the attached Memorandum of Economic
and Financial Policies are adequate to achieve the objectives of the program, but will take any
further measures that may become appropriate for this purpose. Sierra Leone will consult with the
IMF on the adoption of these measures in advance to the revisions to the policies contained in the
Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies in accordance with IMF policies in such
consultation. Further, and in line with its commitment to transparency and accountability, the
government authorizes the IMF to publish this letter, its attachments, and related staff report,
including placement of these on the IMF website in accordance with Fund procedures, following the
IMF Executive Board’s approval of the request.

USA
Dear Madame Lagarde:
On behalf of the government of Sierra Leone, it is our pleasure to send you this supplement to the
Letter of Intent (LOI) dated October 1, 2013, to welcome the change in the policy on discount rate
approved by the Executive Boards of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank on
October 11, 2013. We note that under the new policy, a unified 5 percent discount rate will be used
for the calculation of the present value of external debt in the Debt Sustainability Framework for Low
Income Countries and for the assessment of the concessionality of individual loans. To reflect this
change, and in consultation with IMF staff, we have revised paragraph 13 of the Technical
Memorandum of Understanding attached to the LOI signed on October 1, 2013.

Attachment 1. Memorandum of Economic and
Financial Policies for 2013–16
Freetown, October 1, 2013
Introduction
1.

The government of Sierra Leone implemented in 2010–13 an economic and financial

program supported by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) under the Extended Credit Facility
(ECF). Progress on policy implementation, combined with support from Sierra Leone’s other
development partners helped strengthen macroeconomic stability, advance structural reforms in key
areas, and achieve important objectives under the second-generation Poverty Reduction Strategy
(PRS), The Agenda for Change. To consolidate these gains and address remaining developmental
challenges for Sierra Leone, the government has prepared a new medium-term economic program
for the period 2013–16.
2.

This Memorandum presents the economic and financial policies that the government intends

to implement under the new program, to achieve key objectives under The Agenda for Prosperity, its
new PRS, communicated to the IMF and World Bank on July 15.
3.

Under the new ECF-supported program, the government’s overarching objective is to

accelerate economic growth and reduce poverty further, under policies that are environmentally,
socially, and economically sustainable. This calls for scaling up infrastructure and energy investment;
providing adequate social services; and managing renewable and nonrenewable natural resources
efficiently. Hence, policies under the program will be geared toward creating fiscal space for
improving basic infrastructure and social services while maintaining macroeconomic stability;
strengthening revenue performance and improving public financial management (PFM) systems;
effectively managing the fiscal regime for extractive industries; and supporting private sector
development.

Recent Economic Developments and Short-Term Outlook
4.

Economic growth accelerated and inflation declined in 2012. Real GDP growth is estimated

at 15.2 percent, reflecting increased iron ore production, from 137,000 tons in 2011 to 6.6 million
tons in 2012. Non-iron ore growth is estimated at 5.3 percent (5.8 percent in 2011), driven by output
expansion in agriculture, manufacturing, construction, and services. In agriculture growth has been
sustained since 2010 with the introduction of the government and donor-supported Small Holder
Commercialization Program (SHCP), which encourages small holder farmers to work under organized

48

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SIERRA LEONE

Agriculture Business Centers. With support from the government and development partners, the
SHCP provides improved inputs, tractors, and processing equipment. Projections for 2013 indicate
that real GDP growth would reach about 13.3 percent, driven by increasing value-added from iron
ore production, but also a healthy 6 percent growth in the non-iron ore economy, with key
contributions from other minerals, agriculture, services, tourism, and sustained investment in
infrastructure.
5.

Good progress has been made in containing consumer price inflation, and price pressures

have eased during 2012–July 2013. The inflation rate declined from 16.9 percent at end-2011 to
12 percent at end-2012, and 9.5 percent at end-July 2013. Key contributing factors include
moderation of food inflation, a tight monetary policy stance, and a stable exchange rate.
6.

The external position improved in 2012. A significant increase in FDI flows during 2011 and

2012 has led to a surge in investment-driven imports, and helped finance the resultant current
account deficit. FDI flows moderated in 2012, as the new iron ore projects shifted from the
investment to the export phase, contributing to an improving trade balance and a decline in the
current account deficit. The overall balance of payments recorded a surplus, thus contributing to
reserve accumulation, with coverage of about 3 months of imports (excluding imports related to
iron ore).
7.

Broad money (M2) accelerated by 23.1 percent in 2012, up from 20 percent in 2011. Private

sector credit growth decelerated in 2012 reflecting some crowding out from significantly higher
government borrowing from commercial banks in the securities market, as well as the impact of the
newly established credit reference bureau, which now provides commercial banks a facility to better
establish creditworthiness. Interest rates were relatively stable throughout much of 2012; the
Monetary Policy Rate remained at 20 percent while the average rate on savings stood at 6.5 percent
and lending rates at 20–30 percent. During the same period, the one-year Treasury bond rate was
unchanged at 20 percent and the 91-day Treasury bill rate remained around 23 percent for much of
the year. These rates dropped to 6 percent and 3.2 percent respectively in late August 2013
reflecting the sharp slowdown in government borrowing from the securities market.
8.

Fiscal policy implementation was challenging in 2012 because of the elections. Revenue

collection reached 12.2 percent of non-iron ore GDP compared with 11.5 percent in 2011 reflecting
higher than anticipated taxes from the extractive sector that helped compensate for weak
performance in other tax categories, particularly the windfall in signature bonuses from petroleum
exploration, the one-off payments of advanced payroll tax by one of the iron ore mining companies
and the sale of government shares (in lieu of personal income tax) held in Sierra Rutile Limited.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

49

SIERRA LEONE

Expenditure stabilized at about 22 percent of non-iron ore GDP, partly reflecting a decline in
foreign-funded capital expenditure that compensated a one percentage point increase in current
spending to 13.7 percent of non-iron ore GDP. The increase in current expenditure was partly due to
spending related to the November elections. The wage bill increased from 5.4 percent of non-iron
ore GDP in 2011 to 6.1 percent in 2012, driven by the hiring of 1,589 teachers, and health workers;
partly financed through savings from the retirement of senior staff under the pay reform plan.
Domestically financed capital spending increased from 2.8 percent of non-iron ore GDP in 2011 to
3 percent in 2012, covering mostly infrastructure projects. The overall budget deficit (including
grants) reached Le 854 billion (5.6 percent of non-iron ore GDP), up from 581 billion in 2011
(4.6 percent of non-iron ore GDP). It was mostly financed with project and program loans and
issuance of domestic securities. The latter reached 2.3 percent of non-iron ore GDP, up from
0.9 percent in 2011.

Program Implementation—Taking Stock
9.

Significant progress was made in the implementation of the ECF-supported program that

was cancelled prior to its expiration at end-June. Reform measures and policies put in place have
helped improve macroeconomic stability, advance social policies, and enhance prospects for broad
and inclusive growth.
10.

The program was broadly successful in facilitating growth and macroeconomic stability while

reducing inflation. The advent of large-scale iron-ore mining boosted private sector development
and revenue performance. Overall fiscal performance, however, was challenging, as gaps in budget
execution resulted in recurrent end-year fiscal expenditure overruns. In response, in 2011, corrective
measures were taken to limit by law the Treasury’s access to credit from BoSL to 5 percent of
previous year’s revenue at any time, and eliminate BoSL participation in the primary securities’
market. Subsequently, in 2012, the government established a Cash Management Committee to
improve Treasury cash management and enhance coordination between fiscal and monetary
policies.
11.

While the fiscal position was relatively robust at the outset of the program it weakened over

time due to expenditure overruns and excessive borrowing from the securities market. Expenditure
rose from 17.7 percent of non-iron ore GDP in 2009 to almost 22 percent in 2012 with current
expenditure and domestically-financed investment consistently above the budgeted level. In
2010–12, on average, spending on wages and salaries exceeded program targets by about 5 percent,
goods and services by about 20 percent, and domestically financed capital spending by 56 percent.
While one-off revenue from mining and oil exploration helped finance the additional expenditure,

50

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SIERRA LEONE

higher-than-budgeted spending was met with a build-up of unpaid bills and domestic debt. This led
to mixed results on fiscal performance, highlighting important challenges to efficient PFM.
12.

Monetary and exchange rate policies were consistent with program’s objectives. Monetary

policy was tightened in mid-2011, which, combined with stability in the exchange rate contributed to
decelerating inflation. Increased foreign exchange inflows supported the stability of the leone
against other currencies, and the flexible exchange rate regime was preserved. The Bank of
Sierra Leone’s interventions in the market were limited to smoothing volatility in the market.
13.

On external debt, although higher borrowing for investment in infrastructure added to the

debt stock, the results of the Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) showed that the risk of debt distress
remained moderate. However, stress test results from the DSA showed that it was crucial to sustain
fiscal consolidation efforts, promote growth-enhancing policies, and maintain prudent borrowing
policies in view of the Sierra Leone’s vulnerability to exogenous shocks. While the government did
not accumulate arrears on external debt obligations under the program, it contracted some loans on
non-concessional terms breaching a quantitative performance criterion under the program; waivers
were granted by the IMF Executive Board in the context of program reviews.
14.

An extensive structural reforms agenda was pursued under the program. Most objectives

were met, albeit with delays in some instances. A review of petroleum pricing was carried out to
restore taxes on retail sales of petroleum products; the Domestic Tax Department (DTD) was created;
GST administration was integrated within the Large Taxpayer Office; amendments to the
Government Budget and Accountability Act and the Financial Management Regulation were
submitted to parliament to ensure that only viable capital projects enter into the budget; a pay
reform plan for public servants was put in place; all eligible taxpayers were transferred to the
Medium Taxpayer Office (MTO); regulations to implement a Public Investment Plan, fully integrated
with the budget process, were published; a high-level cash management committee was established;
BSL credit to government was formally capped at 5 percent of previous years’ revenue to reduce
fiscal dominance; regulation and supervision of the financial sector improved and central bank
independence increased under amendments to the BSL and Banking Acts adopted by parliament in
late 2011; the government’s shares in Rokel Commercial Bank were offered for sale through the
stock exchange; BoSL prepared revised prudential guidelines consistent with the Banking Act; and a
credit reference bureau was set up.
15.

In spite of progress discussed above, important challenges remain. Poverty, unemployment,

and underemployment are high, and access to public and social services is limited. In addition,

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

51

SIERRA LEONE

growth prospects are hindered by numerous obstacles, including insufficient power supply and road
networks, and limited access to financial services.

Agenda for Prosperity
16.

Although significant progress has been made since the end of the civil conflict toward social

stability and a sustainable macroeconomic position, more durable poverty reduction and growth
efforts are needed in conjunction with sound macroeconomic management. Building on recent
progress, the government intends to address remaining challenges and accelerate Sierra Leone’s
development through steadfast implementation of the PRS, the Agenda for Prosperity (AfP). It is
recognized under the AfP that economic growth is fundamentally important for poverty reduction
and that growth-promoting policies must be environmentally, socially, and economically,
sustainable. Moreover, it is hoped that effective management of natural resources holds the key to
unlocking wide-ranging environmental and socio-economic benefits to the population at large. A
key objective of the PRS is inclusive, diversified, and sustainable, economic growth, which goes hand
in hand with employment generation and income equality. The ECF-supported program seeks to
underpin this effort by facilitating high quality public investment and growth enhancing reforms in
the context macroeconomic stability. In addition to addressing the efficiency of public investment,
the structural benchmarks under the program focus on Public Financial Management Reforms and
the legal and operational infrastructure for effective revenue mobilization, particularly as it relates to
natural resource revenue. Gaps in private sector development and financial sector development are
addressed in parallel. An indicative floor on social spending under the program ensures consistency
with poverty reduction and growth objectives.
17.

The AfP defines the development path for the country for the period 2013–18. The Agenda

comprises eight sectoral pillars: (i) economic diversification to promote inclusive growth; (ii) natural
resources management; (iii) human development; (iv) competitiveness; (v) labor and employment;
(vi) social protection systems; (vii) governance and public sector reforms; and (viii) gender equality
and women’s empowerment.
18.

Economic diversification to promote inclusive growth. The long term economic growth

target is annual GNI growth of 6.7 percent, and GNI per capita growth of 4.8 percent. Private
sector-led growth and diversification across several competitive sectors would increase value-added
and generate gender-equitable employment. Policy measures in the agriculture sector, historically
the largest sector of the economy, would address smallholder commercialization and larger-scale
agro-based production. A number of regulatory, educational, and investment related sector-specific
measures will be taken to improve the conditions for growth in fisheries, manufacturing, and

52

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SIERRA LEONE

tourism, all of which currently perform below potential. The ECF-supported program seeks
specifically to support private sector development of small- and medium-sized enterprises in the
sectors and reduce transaction costs with respect to trade.
19.

Managing natural resources. Natural resources revenue from both renewable and

non-renewable sources would contribute significantly to growth and poverty reduction. Strong
coordination across-sectors and among agencies and actors within sectors would be essential.
Resource sector activities include mineral resources, fisheries and marine resources, water resources,
land management, forestry management, and oil and gas development. The government would
channel natural resource revenues to transformation activities and to sustain inclusive economic
development. The ECF-supported program seeks to advance the fiscal regime for extractive
industries particularly with respect to the legislative framework and revenue mobilization and
management. A Transformation Development Fund would be established under the umbrella of a
broader Natural Resource Revenue Fund. Strategies are being devised with respect to the
management of key resource categories, including:


Mineral resources. The National Minerals Agency will lead in implementing detailed sector
strategies to ensure that Sierra Leone benefits from minerals exploitation and that negative
externalities are minimized. In addition to regulating larger-scale mines, strategies focus on
regulation and efficiency of artisanal mines. Community Development Agreements will facilitate
improved welfare in mining communities.



Marine Resources. Priority areas include the reduction of over-fishing, which will be addressed
by taking action against illegal fishing, and the slowing of coastal erosion that will be addressed
in consultation with relevant stakeholders.



Water resource management. Given ample water resources but an underdeveloped
distribution system, the government would take action to develop water resources, responding
sustainably to the needs of society and the economy.



Land management. Key priorities include a legal framework for land ownership, developing
land-use planning, creating sustainable infrastructure for social improvement and economic
growth, and training farmers in sustainable land and water practices.



Forests. Redesigned institutional and policy frameworks will coordinate the forestry sector to
address competing demands. Sustainable management would seek to address a broad range of
objectives: forest conservation, watershed regulation, traditional exploitation, economic
development and job creation, eco-tourism, biodiversity and climate change.
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

53

SIERRA LEONE



Oil and Gas. Oil exploration has yielded promising results and commercial production could be
developed shortly. The government is putting in place an institutional and fiscal framework to
regulate the industry and ensure that Sierra Leone benefits from oil and gas in a transparent
manner.


20.

Electromagnetic Spectrum. Future potential in this sector will be explored.
Accelerating human development. Human development would be accelerated through

improving education quality and access, providing extensive health services, controlling HIV/AIDS,
providing safe water and improved sanitation, population policy, including reducing migration to the
cities and slowing fertility and teenage pregnancy, and mainstreaming gender parity. Education
access, equity, and quality, would be improved at all levels, achieving high literacy, and developing a
labor force with the skills demanded by the employment-generating sectors of the economy. Health
care will build on the free health care initiative, scaled-up nutrition programs, expanding
immunization, and increased access to water and sanitation.
21.

Promoting competitiveness. Economic growth will be determined by the success of

Sierra Leone’s companies and industries, enabled by a supportive business environment, including
an institutional framework conducive to private sector development, adequate infrastructure, access
to credit, and availability of skilled labor. Infrastructure investment would have to increase in the
areas of transportation, power, water, ICT, and financial services. Competitiveness will require
partnership between public and private sectors, and coordination among MDAs and development
partners. Government is giving priority to removing the wide range of identified constraints to
private sector development, and to building the necessary supportive environment and
infrastructure. Agriculture, energy and transportation are being given priority in the implementation
of the AfP. Hence, key transformational projects under the AfP would include agriculture irrigation
projects, hydro electric dams, and a new airport on the mainland. The government believes, in
particular, that the construction of a new airport will alleviate the high cost, both time and financial,
and help circumvent the risks in travelling across the Rokel Bay to and from the current airport
(Lungi International Airport). In doing so, it would facilitate unhindered access to the capital city and
the interior of the country. Furthermore, the new airport will help promote regional integration,
increase freight and passenger traffic, enhance government revenue, employment, and other
linkages with the rest of the economy. Also, given Sierra Leone’s geographical location, the new
airport has the potential to serve as a regional hub between Africa and North and South America.
Preliminary estimates put the cost of the project at US$312 million (6.6 percent of 2013 GDP). The
government is looking into options for its financing from its creditors, notably Exim Bank China,
under the Chinese Preferential Concessional Loan Facility. The government is aware of the large
54

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SIERRA LEONE

magnitude of the project cost, and its potential implications for government finances. It will,
therefore, seek to obtain concessional terms for the selected financing option, to ensure consistency
with policy commitments under the ECF-supported program being requested from the IMF. The
government will pursue the project if it is economically viable. It will work closely with Sierra Leone’s
development partners, including the World Bank to assess the project’s economic feasibility, and
with IMF staff on the project’s macroeconomic impact, particularly for external debt and fiscal
sustainability. To facilitate these assessments all documentation, including agreements related to the
airport as well as other large infrastructure projects and their financing will be made available before
they are finalized and prior to the execution of the projects.
22.

Labor and employment. Unemployment and under-employment are high, especially

among youth and women and much of the labor force has little training or education. Informal
employment remains pre-dominant and growing but quality and productivity of informal work is
low. Training and education, small-enterprise development, and access to credit, are seen as
potential drivers of progress while employment quality is crucial for pro-poor growth. The AfP
strategy is to encourage all economic actors to provide productive and adequately remunerative
employment opportunities, for all who are willing to work, including vulnerable groups, while
improving working conditions.
23.

Strengthen social protection. Over half the population lives in poverty and 45 percent of

households are food insecure. Inequity based on gender, age, location, education and income are
commonplace. Malnutrition is widespread. Barriers to female education include high teenage
pregnancy and early marriage. Social protection services are fragmented and inadequate in coverage
and targeting. The AfP stresses implementation of the 2011 National Social Protection Policy, to
complement the positive and general benefit of economic growth. Strategies to develop social
protection policies and increase capacity are under discussion. The aim is to extend social insurance
interventions, provide basic social protection packages for the vulnerable, and strengthen support
for nutrition, health care, education, and housing.
24.

Governance and public sector reforms. Key reforms measures are focused on developing a

capable and transparent public service with an appropriate skills mix underpinned by public sector
pay reform, the development of agencies, institutions, policies, and data systems. Extensive PFM
measures at the central and local government levels address budgeting, expenditure management,
revenue mobilization, auditing, public procurement, and fiscal decentralization.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

55

SIERRA LEONE

25.

Gender equality and women’s empowerment. The government has committed to gender

equality and women’s empowerment, signing a range of policy declarations and enacting legislation.
A number of specific measures are being developed.
26.

The cost of implementing the AfP. Over the implementation period 2013–18, the cost is

estimated at around US$5.7 billion of which US$3.2 billion are identified partner commitments and
US$0.5 billion government allocations. The funding gap remaining is approximately US$2 billion. A
consultative group meeting to raise funds for the strategy is being planned. The government will
explore the potential for attracting both traditional and non-traditional sources of funding through
the following initiatives:


Intensify domestic revenue mobilization. In addition to raising new mining revenue, domestic
revenue mobilization will entail improving the efficiency of tax and non-tax collection and
enforcing compliance. The NRA will continue to implement its modernization plan and improve
on field audits, collection of tax arrears and curbing smuggling activities. The implementation of
GST will be strengthened, and investment incentives streamlined and better applied.



Broaden and deepen development partner support. To facilitate increased support from
traditional donors, the government will work toward further improving its Country Policy and
Institutional Assessment (CPIA) score.



Access funding through the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC). MCC offers a way to
fight poverty through economic growth and good governance.



Prioritize Public-Private Partnerships (PPP). Private sector participation in the funding and
implementation of key projects, particularly in power, water, roads, ports, airports, and telecom,
will be maximized through PPPs.



Explore carbon trading. Government will explore the carbon trading potential.



Explore issuance of Diaspora bonds. Such bonds would finance large scale infrastructure
development projects.



Intensify and broaden corporate social responsibility. Corporate social responsibility would
provide fiscal space for government to pursue certain programs.



Access to international capital markets. The government is working with partners to obtain a
sovereign credit rating.

Medium-Term Macroeconomic Framework
27.

Medium-term objectives are to: (i) achieve a real GDP growth (excluding iron ore) of

7 percent by 2017; (ii) reduce inflation from 12 percent in 2012 to about 5.4 percent by 2017; and
(iii) improve gross reserve coverage to about 4 months of non iron-ore related imports by the end of
the program period.
28.

Economic growth (excluding iron ore) is projected to reach 7 percent in 2017, up from

6 percent in 2013, due to continued public investment scaling up, increased productivity, notably in
agriculture, and sustained activity in construction and services. Non-iron ore activity will also benefit
from upstream activity in iron ore mining where production (under phase I of the largest mine) is
expected to increase through 2015, and level off starting in 2016. Consequently, total real GDP
growth is forecast to rise from 13.3 percent in 2013 to 14 percent in 2014 and decelerate to
12.4 percent in 2015 and 5.2 percent by 2017.
29.

Inflation is projected to decline from 9 percent in 2013 to 5.4 percent in 2017, on account of

continued prudent monetary and exchange rate policies. It is also expected that governmentsupported programs in agriculture would contribute to increased supply of rice and other key food
crops, and help dampen food inflation. In addition, monetary policy would be adequately calibrated
to contain inflationary pressures, and macro-prudential measures would be geared towards a
healthy expansion of private credit.
30.

In the external sector, the current account deficit would narrow from about 20 percent of

non-iron ore GDP in 2013 to around 7 percent by 2017 as exports are projected to increase, notably
in mining and agriculture, while imports would moderate over the medium term, partly reflecting
lower FDI flows than in 2011–12. The improvement in the external current account, combined with
sustained capital inflows is expected to increase gross international reserves from 3.2 months of
imports (excluding iron-ore related imports) in 2013, to 4.1 months by 2017.
31.

The government’s medium-term fiscal strategy aims to strengthen revenue collection,

improve expenditure management, and reduce domestic debt. The revenue efforts will focus on:
(i) broadening the tax base; (ii) reducing customs and GST duty waivers; (iii) combating tax evasion;
and (iv) strengthening the National Revenue Administration through administrative reforms and
increased use of Information Technology. The projected expansion in economic activity and
increased iron ore exports will also support the government’s revenue mobilization efforts. On this
basis, revenue is projected to increase from 12.4 percent of non-iron ore GDP in 2013, to
13.5 percent in 2017; with revenue from mining rising from 1.2 percent of non-iron ore GDP to

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

57

SIERRA LEONE

1.8 percent for the period. Total expenditure will decline from 21.9 percent of non-iron ore GDP in
2012 to 19.7 percent in 2013, which reflects the unwinding of one-off expenditure related to
elections and emergency programs. Total expenditure is projected to average about 20.5 percent of
non-iron ore GDP for 2014–17, with more resources channeled to investment. It is projected that
wages and salaries will stabilize at 6 percent of non-iron ore GDP under the ongoing pay reform.
Under this strategy, domestic borrowing would gradually decline, allowing the stock of public
domestic debt to decline from 12.7 percent of non-iron ore GDP in 2013, to 11.2 by 2018.
32.

The government has initiated a long-term PFM Reform Strategy and begun the process of

modernizing the PFM system. The 2014–17 phase of the strategy will target improvements in the
quality of public financial management to bolster fiscal discipline, the strategic allocation of
resources, and the efficiency of public service delivery. The necessity of addressing these weaknesses
and establishing a tightly controlled fiscal environment is made much more urgent by the need to
manage the substantial streams of revenue expected by 2015. Revenue mobilization and rigorous
planning and control of investment spending are needed to achieve the transformation aimed for
under the Agenda for Prosperity.

Policies and Reforms for 2013–14
A. Fiscal Policy and Public Financial Management Reforms
33.

Fiscal consolidation efforts will continue through enhanced revenue mobilization and

expenditure controls. For 2013, the revised budget, tabled in parliament in early July (Prior Action),
aims to enhance fiscal consolidation efforts As revenue mobilization actions are intensified and
expenditure controls are strengthened through public financial management measures, the overall
deficit (excluding grants) is budgeted at Le 1,172 billion, down from Le 1,487 in 2012. To meet the
fiscal program targets, expenditure on goods and services, transfers and domestically financed
investment will be scaled back in 2013 and domestic bank and nonbank financing will decline from
2.3 percent of non-iron ore GDP in 2012, to 1.9 percent. For 2014, the overall deficit is projected to
increase to Le 1,571 billion. In both years, however, domestic financing is expected to decline from
Le 347 billion in 2012 to Le 337 billion in 2013 and Le 311 billion in 2014. Other sources of financing
include privatization receipts, net external borrowing, and external budget support. In the event of a
shortfall in expected domestic revenue, the government will take corrective measures, including
scaling back non-priority spending and domestically financed investment in order to avoid a buildup
of unpaid bills and domestic debt.

58

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SIERRA LEONE

34.

Revenue is projected at Le 2,197 billion and Le 2,581 for 2013 and 2014 respectively.

Revenue performance will be supported by continuing sustained economic activity in the non-iron
ore economy, and the projected increase in royalties from the mineral sector. Specific measures to
support the revenue target include: (i) the strengthening of the system for collecting taxes on
petroleum products to increase efficiency, and curb fraud. To this end, special NRA accounts will be
opened at the commercial banks for effective monitoring of collections; (ii) the reduction of duty
waivers, with a revenue impact of Le 16.9 billion; (iii) strengthening of Information Technology
systems at the National Revenue Authority (NRA) to increase audit capacity and enhance monitoring
of payments for the goods and services tax; and (iv) the setting up of a resource revenue
administration unit at NRA (structural benchmark).
35.

Total expenditure is budgeted at Le 3,368 billion for 2013, compared with Le 3,360 billion in

2012. This marginal decline reflects the net impact of: (i) the unwinding of expenditure executed in
2012 for the general elections; (ii) the 12 percent wage increase that took effect in June, in the
context of the civil service pay reform including teachers, police and the military personnel, and
planned recruitment in priority sectors estimated at 280 people; and (iii) higher interest payments on
domestic debt due to the conversion of the existing stock of non-negotiable non-interest bearing
bonds (NNIB) held by BoSL into marketable instruments for the conduct of monetary policy. After
the significant increase in 2012, domestically financed investment will stabilize at Le 463 billion, with
the focus on completing ongoing infrastructure projects. It is projected to increase by 35 percent in
2014, as implementation of programs under the Agenda for Prosperity begins.
36.

Measures introduced in 2012 to enhance expenditure and Treasury cash flow management

will be maintained and enhanced in 2013 to consolidate progress in monitoring budget execution
processes, align expenditure commitments with available resources, and continue supporting
coordination between fiscal and monetary policy. Consequently, a rolling treasury cash flow table
has been prepared monthly since the approval of the revised 2013 budget by parliament in July.
New measures were also taken in early 2013 to improve budget execution and enhance fiscal
discipline: (i) a memorandum of understanding was signed with commercial banks to reduce delays
in transferring balance on NRA transit accounts to the Treasury account at the BoSL; and (ii) the 2013
expenditure commitments and issuance of payment orders will be stopped at end-October and
end-November respectively. The government is confident that with these measures float
transactions will be limited.
37.

The government will continue implementing measures needed to improve public financial

management. In this context: (i) the budget preparation process will be strengthened to ensure its
timely transmittal to parliament; (ii) budget execution will be improved to avoid accumulation of
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

59

SIERRA LEONE

float transactions and accumulation of arrears at the end of the year, as well as extrabudgetary
spending. The government has taken actions in 2013 to streamline NRA’s transition accounts,
establish a Treasury Single Account (structural benchmark) for end-June 2014), and enhance the
functioning of the Cash Management Committee. In addition, a new PFM bill will be introduced in
parliament by June 2014 (structural benchmark), notably to clarify provisions on supplementary
budgets and contingency funds needed to avoid extrabudgetary spending. The new PFM bill will
also introduce provisions for the establishment of a Natural Resource Revenue Fund; (iii) the
preparation and execution of the public investment program will be enhanced to ensure that
selected projects are consistent with priorities in the Agenda for Prosperity, and that adequate
feasibility studies as well as realistic costing of projects are carried out before execution. A survey of
ongoing public investment projects was carried out in early 2013, and its results will be used to
enhance the predictability of expected payments on ongoing projects, and enhance project
preparation to contain budget overruns. To strengthen the monitoring of public capital expenditure
execution, bi-annual reports will be prepared to provide information on expenditure commitments,
payments and remaining balances compared with budgetary appropriations. The first report was
prepared for budget execution at end-June 2013 (Prior Action). In 2013–14, the government plans
to take the following measures, all structural benchmarks under the IMF-supported program:


Submit to parliament the Extractive Industries Revenue Bill, including a resource rent tax
(December 2013);



Implement the small taxpayer regime (December 2013), to improve voluntary compliance and
broaden the tax base;



Introduce a new Tax Administration Act to harmonize and clarify tax procedures, particularly with
regard to extractive industries (December 2014);



Establish and staff an operative public investment program unit in the Ministry of Finance and
Economic Development.



Set up of a transparent Natural Resource Revenue Fund sub-account under the Treasury Single
Account (TSA) to support transparent management of expected higher resource revenue
(June 2014); and



Complete a three-year public investment plan (PIP), fully integrated with the budget process and
the revised MTEF for 2014–18, to be submitted to parliament with the 2015 budget, to support
the implementation of the new PRSP, and enhance selectivity in public investments.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SIERRA LEONE

38.

In preparation for higher mining revenue, the government is working towards a medium-

term framework that will anchor domestic fiscal balance around a sustainable level. In line with best
practice modalities for managing planned budget surpluses, a counter-cyclical fiscal rule has been
devised with technical assistance from the IMF Fiscal Affairs Department, based on a non-resource
fiscal balance. The GBAA would be amended to incorporate the fiscal rule, the stabilization and
savings structures for natural resource revenues, and the use of resource revenues within the budget.
These amendments will be part of the abovementioned new PFM law.

B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies and Financial Sector Issues
39.

Monetary policy will continue to target price stability over the medium term. Although price

pressures have been declining since mid-2011, reaching and maintaining single-digit inflation levels
will require a continuing tight monetary policy stance to enhance policy credibility and anchor
inflation expectations. Consistent with this objective, reserve money growth is projected to decline to
14.2 percent in 2013 (18.5 percent in 2012).
40.

The Bank of Sierra Leone (BoSL) and the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development will

undertake steps to improve the efficiency of the government securities market and foster the
development of the money market. The BoSL will finalize guidelines for a primary dealer system for
government securities by June 2014 (structural benchmark). This will facilitate market efficiency by
making government securities easier to buy and sell, encourage secondary market trading, promote
demand for government securities (including for new types of securities, such as longer-term
bonds), and facilitate efficient liquidity management through open market operations. An issuance
calendar for government securities is also being prepared. By announcing a plan in advance for all
maturities and having fewer but larger issues, market participants will be able to plan for and market
these issues, which will enhance the success of issues and encourage more active liquidity
management by the banks.
41.

The BoSL will maintain the flexible exchange rate regime. Interventions in the foreign

exchange market will be limited to transactions aimed at smoothing excessive short-term
fluctuations. The BoSL will remain attentive to challenges arising from the management of foreign
currency denominated government revenue. It will introduce a wholesale foreign exchange auction
system by June 2014 (structural benchmark), to replace the current retail auction system offered to
selected importers. In addition, the BoSL will finalize a revised Foreign Exchange Act, which aligns
Sierra Leone’s legislation in this area with that of its Economic Community of West African States
(ECOWAS) and West African Monetary Zone (WAMZ) partners.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

61

SIERRA LEONE

42.

The Bank of Sierra Leone recognizes the need to build up foreign exchange reserves in light

of the economy’s vulnerability to external shocks. It aims to accumulate an adequate level of foreign
international reserves to gradually increase the coverage to 3.9 months of imports (excepting
imports related to iron ore projects) by 2016, to buttress macroeconomic stability while creating
policy buffers.
43.

The Bank of Sierra Leone will actively pursue initiatives aimed at strengthening the financial

system. It will enhance its supervisory capacity, and offsite supervision through the credit reference
bureau and the rolling out of a new software platform for real time reporting of deposit money bank
balances, as well as preparing a road map to guide the transition to risk-based supervision by June
2014 (structural benchmark). This will help BoSL to better monitor vulnerabilities in the financial
system and facilitate eventual adoption of Basel II Core Principles of Banking Supervision. To support
financial intermediation, the authorities have prepared the Securities Act, which is intended to
promote the development of the Stock Exchange, and the Collective Investment Scheme Act that will
establish the legal framework for investment fund managers. Both measures will be adopted by
cabinet in coming weeks.
44.

To strengthen financial inclusion and broaden access to financial services, BoSL will seek to

improve the credit environment, notably by: (i) preparing a development strategy for small- and
medium-sized enterprises by mid-2014 (structural benchmark), in collaboration with the Ministry of
Finance and Economic Development and with the support of the International Finance Corporation;
(ii) expanding the existing credit reference database to assess credit worthiness; and (iii) enacting the
Borrowers and Lenders Act, which is needed for establishing a collateral registry to support
execution of collateral on bad loans and improve the credit culture. The monetary authorities will
also work together with development partners on a Financial Inclusion Strategy to improve financial
literacy and business practices.

C. Debt Policy and Management
45.

The government will ensure that borrowing policies are compatible with medium- to long-

term debt sustainability. Therefore, it will continue to give priority to grants and highly concessional
loans in meeting financing needs, particularly for infrastructure projects. In view of increasing
challenges for Sierra Leone to obtain external financing on highly concessional terms, the
government would like to request flexibility under the new ECF-supported program for the
financing, on nonconcessional terms, of some socially and economically viable projects for which
concessional funding could not be secured. For 2013–14, such projects include the construction of
two mini dams to provide access to electricity in a rural area.

62

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SIERRA LEONE

46.

To enhance debt management capacity, a comprehensive Medium-Term Debt Management

Strategy (MTDS) will be prepared by December 2013 (structural benchmark) with assistance from
the IMF and World Bank staffs; and the preparation of a quarterly report on debt commitments
initiated in mid-2012 will continue (structural benchmark). Preparatory work is underway to link the
Debt Recording and Management System (CS-DRMS) with the IFMIS.

Other Structural Reforms
47.

The government intends to accelerate implementation of structural reforms, to support

private sector development and enhance growth prospects in the non-mineral economy. The
following actions are planned for 2013–14:


Rehabilitation of the Bumbuna hydroelectric power plant and thermal power generators to
increase energy supply.



Completion of teacher biometric verification exercise and the civil service remuneration survey;
and implementation of measures to strengthen the Public Service Commission.



Simplify processes related to business registration and licensing and construction permits, and
strengthening the fast track commercial courts.



Establish an SME Fund to finance new centers for training and skills development, including
business management, accounting, and project design.


48.

Introduce a one-stop window for imports clearance (Structural benchmark).
The government is aware that additional efforts are needed to improve the quality and

timeliness of economic statistics. It plans to request TA from IMF and other development partners to
address existing weaknesses, including for the producer price index, balance of payments statistics,
mainly for the capital and financial accounts, and agriculture data.

Program Monitoring
49.

The program will be monitored on a semi-annual basis, through quantitative targets and

structural benchmarks (Tables 1 to 2). Quantitative targets for end-December 2013, end-June and
end-December 2014 are performance criteria, while those for end-September 2013, end-March
and end-September 2014 are indicative targets. The first review under the program will be
completed by June 15, 2014; the second and third reviews will be completed by December 15, 2014
and June 15, 2015, respectively.

Attachment 2. Technical Memorandum of Understanding
Freetown, October 1, 2013
Introduction
1.
This memorandum sets out the understandings between the Sierra Leonean authorities and
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) regarding the definitions of the quantitative performance
criteria (PCs) and structural benchmarks (SBs) for the program supported by the Extended Credit
Facility (ECF) arrangement, as well as the related reporting requirements. Unless otherwise specified,
all quantitative PCs and indicative targets will be evaluated in terms of cumulative flows from the
beginning of the period, as specified in Table 3 of the Memorandum of Economic and Financial
Policies (MEFP).
2.
Program exchange rates.1 For the purpose of the program, foreign currency denominated
values for 2013 will be converted into Sierra Leonean currency (leone) using a program exchange
rate of Le 4334/US$ and cross rates as of end December 2012.2

Quantitative Performance Criteria
A. Gross Foreign Exchange Reserves of the Bank of Sierra Leone
3.
Definition. Unless otherwise noted, gross foreign exchange reserves of the Bank of
Sierra Leone (BoSL) are defined as reserve assets of the BoSL. Reserve assets are defined in the IMF’s
Balance of Payments Manual (5th ed.) and elaborated in the reserve template of the Fund’s
International Reserves and Foreign Currency Liquidity: Guidelines for a Data Template. They exclude
foreign assets not readily available to, or controlled by, the monetary authorities.
4.
Adjustment clauses. The floor on the change in gross foreign exchange reserves will be
adjusted (a) downward (upward) by the amount in U.S. dollars of the shortfall (excess) in
programmed external budgetary assistance3—the downward adjustment will be capped at the
equivalent of US$20 million; (b) downward (upward) for any shortfall (excess) in the U.S. dollar value
of disbursements from the IMF under the ECF arrangement; and (c) upward (downward) for any
increase (decrease) in BSL short-term (one year or less in original maturity) foreign currencydenominated liabilities (to residents and nonresidents).

1

The source of the cross exchange rates is International Financial Statistics.

2
For calculating program targets for 2013, all end 2012 stock variables will be based on program exchange rate of
Le 4334/US$.
3

External budgetary assistance is defined as program grants and program loans, excluding HIPC assistance.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

67

SIERRA LEONE

B. Net Domestic Assets of the BSL
5.
Definition. Net domestic assets (NDA) of the BoSL are defined as the end-period stock of
the reserve money less the end-period stock of net foreign assets calculated at the program
exchange rates. Reserve money includes currency issued (equal to currency outside banks plus cash
in vaults), deposits of commercial banks with the BoSL and the BoSL liabilities to other private
sector. Net foreign assets of the BSL are defined as gross foreign exchange reserves (defined above)
minus foreign liabilities. Foreign liabilities are defined as foreign currency-denominated liabilities of
the BSL to nonresidents and the outstanding use of Fund credit. For program purposes, foreign
liabilities exclude SDR allocation.
6.
Adjustment clauses. The ceiling on changes in NDA of the BoSL will be adjusted upward
(downward) by the leone value of the shortfall (excess) in the external budgetary assistance—the
upward adjustment will be capped at the equivalent of US$20 million.

C. Net Domestic Bank Credit to the Central Government (NCG)
7.
Definition. NCG refers to the net banking system’s claims on the central government as
calculated by the BSL. It is defined as follows:
a. the net position of the government with commercial banks, including: (a) treasury bills;
(b) treasury bearer bonds; and (c) loan and advances of commercial banks to the government;
less government deposits in commercial banks;
b. the net position of the government with the BoSL, including: (a) treasury bills and bonds,
excluding holdings of special bonds provided by government to cover the BSL losses; (b) the
stock of non-negotiable non-interest bearing securities (NNNIBS); (c) the difference between
converted NNNIBS into treasury bills and proceeds from their sales; (d) ways and means; and
(e) any other type of direct credit from the BoSL to the government; less (a) central government
deposits; and (b) HIPC and MDRI relief deposits.
8.
Adjustment clauses. The ceiling on changes in NCG will be adjusted (a) upward (downward)
by up to the leone value of the shortfall (excess) in external budgetary assistance—the upward
adjustment will be capped at the equivalent of US$20 million; (b) downward (upward) by the excess
(shortfall) in the leone value of net issues of government securities to the nonbank private sector
vis-à-vis the program assumption (as specified in the memorandum items in Table 3 of the MEFP).
9.
Data source. The data source for the above will be the series “Claims on Government (net)”,
submitted to the IMF staff and reconciled with the monthly monetary survey prepared by the BSL.
10.
Definition of Central Government. Central government is defined for the purposes of this
memorandum to comprise the central government and those special accounts that are classified as
central government in the BSL statement of accounts. The National Social Security and Insurance
Trust and public enterprises are excluded from this definition of central government.

68

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SIERRA LEONE

D. External Payment Arrears of the Public Sector
11.
Definition. External payment arrears of the public sector are defined to include all
debt-service obligations (interest and principal) arising from loans contracted or guaranteed by the
public sector. For the purposes of this PC, the public sector comprises the central government,
regional government, all public enterprises and the BoSL. The non-accumulation of external arrears
is a continuous performance criterion during the program period. For the purposes of this
performance criterion, external arrears are obligations that have not been paid on due dates (taking
into account the contractual grace periods, if any). Excluded from this PC are those debts subject to
rescheduling or restructuring, or are under litigation. This PC will apply on a continuous basis.

E. New Nonconcessional External Debt Contracted or Guaranteed by the
Public Sector with an Original Maturity of One Year or More
12.
Definition. Those are defined as all forms of new debt with original maturity of one year or

Any external debt of which the net present value, calculated with the reference interest rates
mentioned hereafter, is greater than 65 percent of the nominal value (grant element of less than
35 percent) is considered nonconcessional, with the exception of IMF lending. The discount rate
used for the purpose of calculating concessionality is 5 percent. The government will report any new
external borrowing and its terms to Fund staff before external debt is contracted or guaranteed by
the government.

Annex. Implementation of the Revised Guidelines on
Performance Criteria with Respect to Foreign Debt
The term “debt” has the meaning set forth in point No. 9 of the Guidelines on Performance
Criteria with Respect to Foreign Debt adopted on August 24, 2000, which reads as follows:
“(a) For the purpose of this guideline, the term “debt” will be understood to mean a current,
i.e., not contingent, liability, created under a contractual arrangement through the provision of
value in the form of assets (including currency) or services, and which requires the obligor to
make one or more payments in the form of assets (including currency) or services, at some future
point(s) in time; these payments will discharge the principal and/or interest liabilities incurred
under the contract. Debts can take a number of forms, the primary ones being as follows:
(i) loans, i.e., advances of money to obligor by the lender made on the basis of an undertaking
that the obligor will repay the funds in the future (including deposits, bonds, debentures,
commercial loans, and buyers’ credits) and temporary exchanges of assets that are equivalent to
fully collateralized loans under which the obligor is required to repay the funds, and usually pay
interest, by repurchasing the collateral from the buyer in the future (such as repurchase
agreements and official swap arrangements); (ii) suppliers’ credits, i.e., contracts where the
supplier permits the obligor to defer payments until sometime after the date on which the goods
are delivered or services are provided; and (iii) leases, i.e., arrangements under which property is
provided which the lessee has the right to use for one or more specified period(s) of time that
are usually shorter than the total expected service life of the property, while the lessor retains the
title to the property. For the purpose of the guideline, the debt is the present value (at the
inception of the lease) of all lease payments expected to be made during the period of the
agreement excluding those payments that cover the operation, repair, or maintenance of the
property. (b) Under the definition of debt set out above, arrears, penalties, and judicially awarded
damages arising from the failure to make payment under a contractual obligation that
constitutes debt are debt. Failure to make payment on an obligation that is not considered debt
under this definition (e.g., payment on delivery) will not give rise to debt”. (c) Excluded from this
performance criterion are normal import-related credits, disbursements from the IMF, and those
debts subject to rescheduling arrangements.”

Annex I. Sierra Leone: Competitiveness and External Stability
Assessment1
1.

The application of the three

standard methodologies for the
exchange rate assessment suggests
that the real exchange rate is broadly in
line with its long-run equilibrium,
consistent with the previous Article IV
Consultation staff report (Country
Report No. 10/370). External stability is
particularly difficult to benchmark for a
post-conflict economy like Sierra Leone
(SLE) partly because of short historical time series. While staff analysis suggests that the current
account deficit may exceed sustainable levels based on external sustainability methodology, with
large uncertainties surrounding estimates due to data limitations and structural changes in the
economy, there is no strong evidence of real exchange rate misalignment that could lead to external
instability in the medium term. Equilibrium current account deficit estimates are between
4.8–6.8 percent of GDP compared to an underlying deficit of 5.7 percent. The result shows a small
overvaluation of 3.5 percent under the external sustainability, and 4.5 to 6.0 percent of
undervaluation under macro balance and equilibrium exchange rate approaches.

these indicators, important impediments to
private sector development remain, requiring continued implementation of structural reforms to
reduce transaction costs and create an environment conducive to private sector-led growth.
3.

Sierra Leone’s international reserves were US $420.0 million (3.1 months of prospective

imports)2 in 2012. The reserve level, as measured by import coverage is on the low end of the
spectrum for comparable countries in the region. For example, ECF countries3 import coverage
ranges from 1 to 7 months of imports and SADC has an informal target of 6 months of imports.
4.

Dabla-Norris, et. al. (2011) and IMF (2011) have proposed a new methodology to assess

reserve adequacy for low income countries, taking account of both costs and benefits of holding
reserves. In this framework, a crisis is defined as a sharp drop in absorption, and the optimal level of
reserves is determined when the crisis prevention and mitigation benefits of reserves are balanced
against the net financial cost of reserves, defined as foregone investment opportunities measured by
the marginal product of capital. An important feature of the model is that optimal reserve holdings
depend on country characteristics and policy fundamentals.
5.

This methodology was applied to Sierra Leone with the following assumptions: shock

variables (terms of trade, external demand, FDI to GDP ratio, and aid to GDP ratio) were set at the
bottom 10 percentile of the country specific distribution over the past decade (2002–2012);4 The

ECF countries are Cape Verde, Mozambique, Rwanda, Senegal, Tanzania, and Uganda. Countries that qualify for ECF

Longer time series may be more ideal, but we focus on the past 10 years given the significant structural changes
experienced by the Sierra Leonean economy.

Reserve holdings would be interpreted as the optimal level of reserves in the face of large

shocks. Under the baseline scenario, the fiscal deficit (including grants) is 4.92 percent of GDP and
the CPIA index, which measures institutional strength is 3.29. Given a higher CPIA score
(e.g., 3.5, improving from a weak performer to a medium performer), optimal reserve holdings would
be lower than the baseline as stronger institutions lower the probability of a crisis. The outcome
would be broadly similar for an improved fiscal position (a deficit of 3 percent), optimal reserve
holdings would be even lower.

76

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SIERRA LEONE

7.

Optimal reserve holdings for Sierra Leone range from 2.9 months of imports to 6.4 months

of imports.5 The openness of the economy and exposure to international commodities prices would
argue for import coverage towards the high end of this spectrum in order to be in a position to
weather external shocks. In light of large infrastructure investment needs, however, the opportunity
costs of holding reserves is relatively high so a target closer to the middle of this range might be
more appropriate. Targeting the level of reserves closer to 4 months of imports would bring reserves
coverage more in line with comparable countries.

5

Note that this estimate is based on current imports. Import coverage based on prospective imports tends to be
slightly lower than that based on current imports.

Annex II. Sierra Leone: Financial Sector Development Issues1
Profile of the Financial Sector
A. Institutional Structure
1.

The financial sector has expanded rapidly in recent years. Banks represent the bulk of the

financial system, with over 80 percent of all assets, equivalent to 22 percent of GDP in 2012. The
number of commercial banks rose from 8 in 2006 to 13 in 2013, with new foreign entrants into the
market.2 Bank assets and deposits have tripled since 2006, but the banks remain relatively small, with
an average of total assets of about $64 million. Concentration is relatively high, as the two largest
banks hold 37 percent of assets, and 49 percent of the aggregate loan portfolio (Table 1). There are
three medium-sized banks, and eight small banks. Efficiency is low; noninterest expense is equal to
58 percent of gross income, while interest rate spreads have averaged some 13 percentage points
since 2011.
2.

The rest of the financial system is relatively small, with assets accounting for less than

20 percent of system assets, or about 5 percent of GDP. The nonbank financial institutions
include ten insurance companies, nine community banks, nine insurance companies, three housing
finance companies, two savings and loans, the Finance and Trust Corporation, two discount houses,
some forty-two foreign exchange bureaus, and six non-deposit taking microfinance institutions. The
state pension fund institution—National Social Security and Insurance Trust (NASSIT)—is the key
nonbank financial institution, with assets of around 10 percent of GDP. The stock exchange was
launched in July 2009, and currently trades irregularly as the sole listing is one commercial bank.

3.

The inter linkages between the banks and other financial institutions appear limited.

Banks’ core business is basic traditional banking activities with very limited insurance services or
securities trading. The NASSIT has some deposit placement and about 20 percent of its institutional
investment of pension funds in the shares of commercial banks. The lack of reliable data on
nonbank financial institutions transactions makes it impossible to assess the degree of exposure of
the banks to these institutions.
4.

Transactions in the economy are mainly cash based with very limited use of electronic

payment methods. To date, banks are engaged mostly in retail business and there is virtually no
use of credit cards, internet payment, or ATMs.3 The clearing and payment system is based on
manual data entry. The process of settlements across the banks is not yet automated, due to lack of
a national switch system and absence of adequate IT and power systems. The Sierra Leonean
authorities, with the technical and financial assistance from the African Development Bank and the
West African Monetary Zone, are in the process of developing an electronic, large-value national
payments system.

B. Access to Financial Services
5.

Despite the fast growth of the banks, access to financial services is still low. The level of

financial intermediation has grown steadily since the end of the civil conflict in 2001, both in terms
of level of broad money and loan creation relative to GDP (Figure 1). However, when benchmarking
against regional and low income country data, credit levels and deposit transformation are very low.
World Bank data for 2011 indicates that other measures of financial inclusiveness, such as branch
3

penetration and account prevalence are catching up to peer group norms. In 2012, there were
89 bank branches in Sierra Leone, up from 57 in 2008, roughly equivalent to three branches per
100,000 persons. However, rural areas remain largely unbanked. As of 2011, household survey data
indicate that around one in seven have deposit accounts in commercial banks, up from 9 percent in
2008, but only 1 percent are borrowers.4 Mobile banking services are still embryonic.
6.

The development of financial intermediation is hampered by the structure of the

market. A range of factors are hindering the deepening of financial intermediation, including
market structure, the business environment, and the infrastructure of the financial sector.
Market structure. Sierra Leone lacks markets for trading of longer-term securities or bonds.
Bank liabilities tend to be short-term demand and savings deposits (Figure 1). Although relative
share of demand deposits is gradually declining, banks continue to invest largely in short-term
government treasury bills and extend credit for only short terms at high rates to avoid risks.

Macroeconomic instability. Sierra Leone has experienced bouts of high inflation and currency
depreciation (most recently 2009–10) due to both domestic and international shocks. This has
contributed to negative real interest rates on deposits, slowing financial deepening.
The business environment. Sierra Leone is ranked 10th among low income countries in the

performer in areas important for the development of financial intermediation, such as red tape
and high administrative costs on property registration, contract enforcement, and building
permits.

SIERRA LEONE



The infrastructure of the financial sector. As noted above, Sierra Leone lacks many
ingredients for developing the financial sector, including interbank markets, branch networks
that extend beyond major urban areas, an automated payments mechanism, and adequate
supervisory capacity.

C. The Regulatory System
7.

The BSL has made strides toward building supervisory capacity and putting in place

the fundamental components for a modern financial system. The BSL and Banking Acts have
been revised to strengthen compliance toward Basel Core Principles; prudential bank guidelines
have been drafted; a benchmark policy rate has been introduced to improve monetary policy
signaling; and a credit reference bureau was established in 2011. The African Development Bank is
providing support to create an automated payment system, which is expected to go live in 2013.
Nevertheless, significant gaps remain, and technical assistance will continue in the areas of banking
supervision and monetary and foreign exchange operations and markets. Looking ahead, the
authorities intend to given special emphasis to enhancing access to finance. The BSL is already
actively supporting initiatives to encourage the development of microfinance institutions in rural
areas and credit facilities for small- and medium-sized enterprises, and is developing a financial
literacy campaign.

Progress in Reform Implementation and Challenges
8.

The authorities’ reform agenda is informed by their comprehensive Financial Sector

Development Plan (2009), which sets out a long-term program to foster financial
intermediation. The FSDP was prepared based on recommendations from the 2006 FSAP, which
found a number of financial sector weaknesses, including institutional, administrative, legal, and
physical impediments (e.g., power supply). The preparation of the plan was spearheaded by the BSL,
with input and financial support from development partners, and in consultation with stakeholders
in the Sierra Leonean financial sector. This plan feeds into Sierra Leone’s two most recent poverty
reduction strategies, the Agenda for Change (2009–12) and the Agenda for Prosperity (2013–16),
which aim to grow the private sector from a very low base of financial development.
9.



The FSDP emphasizes four priority areas:
Creating an enabling environment in line with best international practice, through legislative and
regulatory reforms and maintenance of macroeconomic stability, inter alia to bolster financial
system stability.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

81

SIERRA LEONE



Strengthening the central bank infrastructure, particularly supervisory capacity and IT systems,
and installing an electronic payments system.



Increasing access to finance by improving financial literacy, strengthening microfinance and rural
credit governance and supervision.



Improving mobilization and investment of long-term funds by strengthening savings institutions
and the capital market;

10.

Progress under the FSDP has accelerated, particularly in areas concerning legislative

and regulatory framework. An FSDP Secretariat was established at the BSL to coordinate the work
plan. Implementation was initially slow as technical challenges delayed disbursements, but several
milestones were completed in 2011–12:



Comprehensive revisions of the legal framework have been completed, including the Bank of
Sierra Leone Act (2011), Banking Act (2011), and AML/CFT Act (2012);



A bad debtor database was established through the Credit Reference Act (2011);



Revised commercial bank prudential guidelines came into effect January 2013;



The BSL has added and trained staff to the Banking Supervision Department.

11.

Progress has been more modest in areas concerned with physical infrastructure and

structural capacity. Resource constraints and donor coordination have proven challenging in areas
requiring significant capital investment and broad technical skill development, e.g., the
modernization of the payments system, establishment of a liquid interbank market, and the
transition to risk-based supervision.

Financial Stability and Risks
12.

The overall situation in the banking sector has improved, but financial soundness

indicators (at end-December 2012) suggest vulnerabilities at certain banks (see Table 2 and
Figures 4–5). This assessment broadly restates the vulnerabilities highlighted by the 2011 Financial
Stability Analysis.
13.

The system-wide capital adequacy ratio remains comfortable. Banks’ risk-weighted

capital adequacy ratios are generally well above the statutory norm of 15 percent, except at the two
largest banks, both of which have a state participation. With regard to the latter, banking
supervisory procedures have been invoked to address the weak capital positions, although progress
82

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SIERRA LEONE

in this area has been slow. Across the system bank capital ratios declined from 2008 to 2011 as
lending to the private sector increased, raising the proportion of assets held at higher risk weights.
The regulatory capital ratio stabilized during 2012, in line with slowing private credit and higher
government securities issuance.
14.

Credit risk remains high, and banks are vulnerable to high concentration in lending.

While lending activity has increased substantially during the last five years, the level of
non-performing loans has declined from over 30 percent in 2007 to 14 percent in 2012, higher than
the mean for Sub-Saharan Africa. The level of nonperforming loans (net of provisions) to regulatory
varies widely from bank to bank, and a few banks exhibit a very high risk appetite. Lending appears
relatively diversified across sectors, with international trade, construction, and services (business and
government) accounting for approximately two-thirds of all loans. However, loan concentration is
high; banks’ total largest exposures rose sharply at end-2012 to 300 percent, and substantially
higher than the 400 percent prudential norm at the two largest banks.
15.

Earnings have remained strong. Bank returns have improved, with net interest income

rising despite a slowdown in lending to the private sector, boosted by high yields on short-term
government securities. However, as a result, income has become increasingly dependent on the
spread between deposits and government securities, highlighting interest rate risks (Figure 2).
Figure 2. Sierra Leone: bank Interest Income and Treasury Bill Interest Rates

16.

The system is highly liquid, although prone to volatile flows. Bank liquidity ratios are

generally high, but volatile liquidity conditions, as reflected by substantial swings in excess reserves
levels, can result in short falls at the aggregate level relative to the required statutory minimum.
Systemic conditions are influenced by large and irregular inflows, particularly bunchy government
payments on ongoing domestic infrastructure investment projects. Lacking an established domestic

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

83

SIERRA LEONE

money market, banks are also critically dependent on the ability to cash in their holdings of treasury
bills.
17.

Foreign exchange risk appears limited. The share of foreign liabilities to total deposits

remains at around 25 percent, but recent exchange rate stability has helped to stabilize the level of
deposit dollarization. Foreign currency lending is not permitted.

Annex III. Sierra Leone: In Search of Inclusive Growth—Key
Lessons from the Literature1
Sierra Leone started well at independence, but was battered by external and domestic
factors, including adverse terms of trade shocks, ill-advised policy response to the
financial impact of hosting the summit of the Organization of African Unity in 1980, and
political instability. The civil conflict that resulted from these economic and political
frustrations ended in 2002 but post-conflict challenges remain visible. However, all is not
lost—there are new opportunities amidst old challenges. The country is poised for a boom
in extractive industry activity, with the commencement of iron ore mining in 2011 and
prospects for oil and gas. However, it trails behind in human development indicators and
institutional reform. The current policy challenge is to efficiently manage these resources
to enhance employment opportunities and reduce poverty. This note draws on stylized
facts from the literature and country experiences, and outlines key guideposts for policy in
Sierra Leone.

A. Background
1.

Sierra Leone used to be characterized by solid natural resource base, robust

macroeconomic trends, and exemplary educational standards. In the decade following
independence in 1961—a period of post-independence gust and vibrancy—the economy of
Sierra Leone was booming, supported by abundant natural resources, agriculture and tourism. The
country was popular for diamonds, rutile, iron ore, gold, food sufficiency, and was a prime tourist
destination in West Africa. It was also referred to as the Athens of West Africa because it served as
the hub for tertiary education in English-speaking West Africa—mainly the Gambia, Ghana, Liberia,
and Nigeria. During this period, which pre-dates onset of the civil conflict in 1975, per capita real
GDP growth averaged 4 percent per annum (a high level by regional standards) and inflation
averaged 6 percent.
2.

Adverse terms of trade shocks coupled with build-up of economic pressures in the

aftermath of the OAU summit eroded productivity, stoked price pressures, and instigated
political and civil conflict. Given its buoyant economy, the country was called upon by the African
Union to host the OAU summit of heads of state in 1983. Coupled with adverse impact of a decline
in iron ore prices in the mid-1970s, the financial decadence that followed the Organization of
African Unity (OAU) meetings in 1983 eroded these gains even prior to the onset of the civil conflict
in 1991. The main iron ore mining company, Delco mines, had to shut down and this triggered

deterioration in the balance of payment as well as exchange rate and inflationary pressures that laid
the foundations for political instability. During this period—of internalized adverse external shocks—
per capita real GDP growth declined by 2 percent per year and inflation averaged 40 percent
(Figures 1 and 2). While per capita real GDP growth declined on average by 2 percent per year,
inflation averaged 40 percent as the local currency depreciated by 24 percent relative to the dollar.
The confluence of these factors visited untold hardship on the citizens and, coupled with the onset
of the civil conflict in neighbouring Liberia, fueled the civil conflict that raged during 1991–2001—a
period of heightened per capita misery.

adverse effects of the OAU summit and terms of trade shock; consumer price inflation reached
70 percent in 1991 and averaged 25½ percent per year, while per capita real GDP growth declined
by 7½ percent per year during the period. The country entered a phase of unprecedented per capita
misery as infrastructure and human development suffered massive setback and basic social services
disappeared overnight. Productivity growth and social indicators plummeted and Sierra Leone has
since trailed behind regional peers on many social indicators (Table 1).
4.

Quest for socio-economic inclusiveness, following civil conflict and global economic

slowdown in the midst of mineral wealth, has heightened search for inclusive growth. Half a
century has elapsed since Sierra Leone attained independence, and it has been a decade since the
end of the civil conflict that halted economic activities, but structural impediments and institutional
bottlenecks linger and continue to constrain output and employment growth. Notwithstanding
progress in institution building that has helped restore order and bolstered democratic principles,
the country remains poor and ranks low (180 out of 182 countries considered in 2009) on the global
human development index. Policy makers have sought to garner resources and the general
population around a three-year development plan dubbed the Agenda for Change (the country’s
second Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, 2009–12), which addresses the infrastructure gap while
boosting agricultural and human development. A successor strategy (the Agenda for Prosperity)
aims at addressing unemployment, boosting human development, and building a social protection
floor; it features a chapter on gender equality and women’s empowerment.
5.

This note presents stylized facts from current research on inclusive growth, and draws

policy lessons on the way forward for Sierra Leone. Themes that keep recurring in the literature
on inclusive growth include the role of (i) sound macroeconomic policies; (ii) good institutions; and
(iii) affordable social protection floor. Using growth accounting and panel econometric regressions,
Kumah and Sandy (2013) found that



pursuance of policies that promote macroeconomic stability is an essential tool in the search for
inclusive growth;



while opening up the economy helps expand the resource envelop for development and
inclusive growth, evolution of the real exchange rate should be watch in order to ensure
continued external competitiveness;



access to credit is essential for inclusive growth, but excessive credit booms should be watched
to ensure financial stability; and

88

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SIERRA LEONE



progress on structural reforms that enhance efficiency of public institutions boost policy
effectiveness and inclusive growth; so do improvements in the business environment.

Thus, while capital accumulation is essential for economic growth, supporting economic policies and
institutional and business environment are equally important. The rest of the paper elaborates on
these findings and their relevance to Sierra Leone in its search for inclusive growth.

B. Stylized Facts from the Literature
6.

The search for inclusive growth and economic policies conducive to such growth

started with an inquiry into appropriate operational definition and characterization. Several
researchers have attempted various definitions of inclusive growth, ranging from pro-poor growth
to poverty-reducing growth. The approach adopted by these earlier researchers was bedeviled by
criticality of the distinction between absolute and relative poverty. Ravallion and Chen (2003) put
this succinctly as the questions of “how the gains from aggregate economic growth (or losses from
contraction) were distributed across households according to their initial incomes or expenditures.”
7.

Empirical evidence shows that sustained economic growth reduces poverty and

income inequality. While most of these findings are based only on analysis of correlation
coefficients among relevant variables and do not indicate causality, it is widely documented (see for
example Rodrik (2000) and Dollar and Kraay (2000)) that sustained rapid growth that expands
economic opportunities also tends to make society well off—thus reducing absolute poverty. Thus,
inclusive growth has come to be defined as growth that enlarges the size of the economy and
increases employment opportunities. Attaining this type of growth helps reduce absolute poverty, in
particular, as the GINI coefficient tends to be stable over time.
8.

The relevant question to ask is what types of policies promote growth and reduce

poverty. In a discourse on the impact of economic growth on poverty reduction, Rodrik (2000)
asserts that “… the magnitude of poverty reduction payoff from growth depends, in part, on a
country’s specific circumstances and policies.” Investigating the significance of various policies on
economic growth and poverty reduction, Dollar and Kraay (2000) found openness to foreign trade,
good rule of law and fiscal discipline, and avoidance of inflation to be important drivers. They
conclude that “… growth generally does benefit the poor…” and that the quest for poverty reduction
should aim at policies that promote growth. Furthermore, they argue for good institutions, the rule
of law, and property rights along with political stability (and peace) when they assert that these
conditions “… directly create a good environment for poor households to increase their production
and income.” Indeed, in their analysis of the growth-poverty nexus, Pinkovskiy and Sala-i-Martin

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

89

SIERRA LEONE

(2010) indicated that poverty and GDP per capita in the largest Sub-Saharan African countries
during 1970–2009 (Ethiopia, South Africa, Nigeria, and Congo-Zaire) are “mirror images of each
other”—thus, consistent with the findings of Dollar and Kraay (2000), policies that promote growth
of per capita GDP also help reduce poverty.
9.

We gather from these findings that (i) growth-promoting policies also help alleviate poverty,

since the GINI coefficient tends to be constant over time, and that (ii) economic policies and quality
of institutions do matter in the quest for inclusive growth; just as initial country circumstances (for
example, countries just emerging out of war have different challenges from those that have enjoyed
long periods of peace) and the nature of the business environment, including access to credit. These
are the factors at the core of empirical research into inclusive growth, which are very pertinent to
Sierra Leone’s specific circumstances—the significance of institutions and economic policy. In what
follows, we use a growth accounting exercise complemented by panel econometric estimates (which
is a standard approach in the literature) to demonstrate the significance of these factors.

factor productivity (TFP) is an important factor in real per capita output growth (Table 2). For the full
sample, real per capita GDP growth averaged 2 percent in 1960–2010, mainly originating from TFP
which contributed about 1.5 percentage points to this growth. Per capita growth in low-income
countries, including Sub-Saharan African countries, averaged 1 percent during the same period, with
the bulk contribution originating from capital accumulation.
11.

Sierra Leone exhibits a decline in total factor productivity, despite capital

accumulation. Real per capita output shrunk overall during 1960–2010 as TFP declined despite

capital accumulation, particularly during the civil conflict in the late 1990s (Table 1 and Figure 1). The
country trails behind it peers on comprehensive institutional reforms and competitiveness. The
World Economic Forum 2012 report on competitiveness puts Sierra Leone at 143th place out of
144 countries. At the same time, the Global Competitiveness Report identifies as constraints to
improving the investment climate the infrastructure gap, poor health and primary education
services, low financial market development, weak institutions, and inefficient labor and goods
market. Hence, integrating capital accumulation with capacity building and improvements in
efficiency of basic service delivery would support the production process and deliver better
economic growth and employment results.
Empirical Econometric Results
12.

Real per capita output growth is depended not only on the efficiency of capital-labor

ratio but also of the productivity enshrined in entire production processes. Following the
classical approach of Solow (1957), we postulate that the residual from a regression could be
interpreted as capturing total factor productivity, which could be dependent in turn on a variety of
factors—such as openness of the economy (which expands the resource envelope of a country), the
business and institutional environment, macroeconomic policies (the quality of economic
institutions and arrangements and of initial policy stance), and access to credit—that have been
considered in the literature.
13.

To investigate the significance of these factors in the growth process, we specify an

empirical panel econometric model of the form:

yit   yi ,t 1   kit   X it  i  vit
where yit denotes real per capita GDP growth,

kit

(1)

is the capital-labor ratio, and

X it

is a matrix of

proxy variables used to capture the effects of total factor productivity. As discussed above, we
include in

X it

variables such as openness, the real effective exchange rate, an indicator of

macroeconomic stability, credit boom and real government consumption. It turns out that inflation
variability (defined as the logarithm of the deviation of inflation from the trend in 1960–70) is a
good indicator of macroeconomic stability. Likewise, credit boom (defined/derived as the logarithm
of deviations of real private credit from trend) works well as an indicator for access to credit, as
increases in this proxy variable has the desired effects on real per capita growth. The variable

it

vit is an error term with the usual
classical assumptions: (i) orthogonality and zero mean ( E[i ]  E[vit ]  E[i vit ]  0 ); serial
captures unobservable country-specific characteristics, while

A priori propositions exclude instability and are empirically tested. We do expect, a

priori and consistent with the theory, |  |  1 for stability, and a positive response of real per capita
GDP growth to increases in the real capital-labor ratio (i.e.,   0 ). Economic openness as defined,
measures the extent to which a country trades with the rest of the world; by definition, therefore,
openness is expected to yield additional resources to a country in the form of gains from trade, and
hence should increase growth potentials. Real exchange rate appreciation/depreciation
reduce/enhance competitiveness of countries and has negative/positive effects on per capita real
GDP growth. Further, macroeconomic stability is expected to enhance growth prospects, as it helps
predictability and reduces costs to businesses. It cannot be overemphasized that growth of the
private sector depends, first and foremost, on access to credit, which in turn, improves growth
prospects. On the other hand, excessive real government consumption (i.e., public spending on
wages and salaries, transfers and goods and services) only competes with the private sector for
limited resources and hence reduces growth as the private sector tends to be crowded out by
government spending.
15.

The empirical results laud capital accumulation with economic openness (Table 3).

Thus,


Capital stock elasticity of real per capita growth is higher for SSA countries and LICs
(0.05–0.06) than for the full sample (0.02). This supports the theoretical proposition of
increasing returns on capital at lower levels of capital accumulation; and



Openness stimulates per capita real GDP growth. The results indicate that more open
countries tended to have experienced higher real GDP per capita growth during the period
1960–2010;

3

This assumption suggests the fixed effects econometric methodology in estimating the coefficients of our models
in subsequent sections as a more suitable approach over the random effects approach. Indeed, country performance
on the elements of the X variable set is in reality broadly dependent on country circumstances and/or initial
conditions.

Further empirical exercises using an expanded set of independent variables underscore

the significance of macroeconomic policies and institutions. These results lead us to investigate
the impact of other factors on the magnitude of capital elasticity of economic growth; more
specifically, the question we seek to answer is whether capita accumulation alone is sufficient to
support inclusive growth—alternatively, do initial conditions, quality of institutions, and economic
policy matter? To answer this question, we replace the openness variable in

X it

with more active

policy variables such as the real effective exchange rate, inflation variability, increases in private
sector credit (or episodes of credit boom), and government consumption. All these variables are
expressed in logarithms and so their respective coefficients in estimates of equation (1) indicate
elasticities or responses of economic growth (or inclusive growth) to policy. We also investigate the
role of the quality of institutions. The results in the Appendix Tables 1 and 2 are summarized in two
parts below—the role of (a) macroeconomic policy, and (b) quality of institutions.
Sound macroeconomic policies drive real per capita output growth
17.

Macroeconomic stability helps develop a predictable economic environment and helps

private sector development and job creation. In our model, the impact of macroeconomic policy
(or stability) on inclusive growth is captured through an inflation viability indicator which is
estimated as the logarithm of the squared deviations of inflation from the trend established in the
1960s. It turns out that attaining macroeconomic stability improves growth performance in all
samples considered. In particular, countries that reduced inflation variability through appropriate

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

macroeconomic policies gained on inclusive growth—the elasticity, albeit small, is highly significant
and consistent with a priori expectations of the effectiveness of macroeconomic policy.
18.

Real exchange rate movements (through variations in the nominal exchange or

inflation or some combinations of these) do influence economic growth through the trade
balance. In particular, exchange rate appreciations tend to adversely affect the trade balance and
growth. Our empirical findings summarized in Table 3 are consistent with these theoretical
predictions, which underscore the need for inflation control along with awareness about the impact
of nominal exchange rate movements, particularly in natural resource rich countries, such as
Sierra Leone, where large inflows into the mining sector might lead to nominal appreciation of the
domestic currency while driving a wedge between wages in the tradable and nontradable sectors of
the economy.

Availability of finance (or access to credit) helps finance private sector economic

activity and boosts growth and employment. While our empirical results for all low-income
countries are consistent with this proposition, SSA countries exhibit a perverse result where
increases in credit (or credit boom) do reduce real per capita growth. This may be due to interaction
of the dependent variable with the incidence of high nonperforming loans in some SSA countries
and prevents effective realization of the positive effects of credit availability. Further research would
be needed to investigate the relationship between credit and growth in SSA countries taking into
account the effect of financial sector health generally.

Further, we plot two indicators of macroeconomic policy (the CPIA indicator on overall

macroeconomic management and our inflation variability indicator) against per capita real GDP to
get insights into the role of macroeconomic policy in promoting inclusive growth. The results
depicted in Figure 3 below further strengthen our findings from the econometric exercise.

Specifically: (i) countries that have made good progress on overall macroeconomic management,
culminating into higher average CPIA scores in 2005–09 also showed high average per capita
real GDP growth in 1960–2010. This finding runs through for all country samples considered—the
full sample (in row 1), sample of LICs (in row 2), and SSA countries (in the last row); and
(ii) macroeconomic stability promotes inclusive growth—the charts in the second column of Figure 3
confirm this with a negative slope between average inflation variability and per capita real GDP
growth in 1960–2010.
Quality of economic institutions matter
21.

To avoid entering into the complexities of the nature of the interaction of institutions with

economic factors and initial conditions (such as previous adverse or benign socio-political and/or
economic conditions),4 we regroup all our country samples into subgroups of above and below
average performers on the World Bank CPIA indicators for quality of structural policies, business
environment, and overall macroeconomic management. We then run panel fixed effects regressions
for these subgroups to ascertain whether there are any significant changes in estimated multipliers.
Based on these results (Appendix Table 1) we derive the total policy effects on inclusive growth of a
ten-percent improvement in the quality of policy (i.e., in macroeconomic stability government
consumption and the real effective exchange rate). Improvements in macroeconomic stability and
the real effective exchange rate are here interpreted as reductions or stability in inflation variability
and the real effective exchange rate, while improvements in government consumption are increases
in current government current spending that does not crowd-in the private sector or introduce
inefficiencies that reduce the production possibilities frontier.
22.

A simple penalty function is used to capture total effects of policy changes on

inclusive growth. The penal aspect comes in where the sign of a coefficient deviates from its apriori
theoretical expectations. We specify the simple penalty function:

n

n

k 1

k 1

 p    k ˆ k    g (ck ( p))

(2)

4

Initial conditions have received much attention in the literature, but their characterization of the elements/factors—
including colonial origins (Acemoglu et al., 2001), the slave trade (Nunn, 2008), and geography (Bloom and Sachs,
1998), and—differ from our use of the term. Consistent with our view, some researchers (such as Fosu, 2012) use past
policy regimes to proxy initial conditions. In this literature, such past policy regimes or “policy syndromes” are
defined to include state controls, adverse redistribution, suboptimal intertemporal resource allocation, and state
breakdown or war and civil conflict. Bosworth and Collins (2003) define initial conditions to include population
growth, geography, institutional quality and initial per capita income.

is the penalty coefficient (in this example, we set this to 10, the percent increase in the

policy variable); and k (=1,2,…,n) is the number of policy variables.
23.

The results confirm that the quality of structural reforms, the business environment,

and of the overall macroeconomic management do matter for economic growth—and job
creation (Figure 4).5 Specifically, total policy impact in countries that scored well (i.e., above
average) on the World Bank’s CPIA sub-modules on these indicators is higher that the baseline
(where no distinction is made regarding the quality of institutions and policy implementation) and
across all country groupings, except in low-income countries (on all three indicators) and SSA
countries (on the structural policies indicator). Thus, for SSA countries for example, the difference in
the policy impact of a 10 percent improvement in the chosen policy variables varies by as much as
9 percentage points and 2 percentage points above the baseline impact, for quality of the business
environment and overall macroeconomic management, respectively.

5

A simple version of the penalty function (with

These results are broadly corroborated by Figure 5, which reveals the significance of

structural reforms and the quality of the business environment for real per capita GDP growth for all
country groupings considered—the full sample in the first row, LICs in the second row, and SSA in
the third row. The positive slope of the estimated trend line confirms this observation. Further, and
similar to the results in the section above, almost all SSA countries fall below the average
performance for their peers that scored similarly on the business environment indicator and the
structural policies indicator. Again, this may indicate the absence of necessary ingredients such as
peace, basic infrastructure, and human capacity. It is therefore no surprise that Sierra Leone, which
has been through a decade of civil conflict that devastated basic infrastructure and halted progress
in building human capacity, experienced even lower average per capita real GDP growth rate during
the period even among its peer SSA countries that scored similar levels of quality of the business
environment (such as Côte d’Ivoire and Mozambique) and progress on structural reform
(Côte d’Ivoire and Niger).

C. Relevance for Macroeconomic Policy in Sierra Leone
25.

The search for inclusive growth in Sierra Leone has to incorporate stylized facts from

the literature: while capital accumulation and the pursuit of macroeconomic stability are important,
the quality of institutions and economic policy do matter. Dividends from steadfast pursuit of
macroeconomic stability cannot be overemphasized. Not only does it help maintain the value of
money (and dampen the burden of instability on the poor in society) but it also helps maintain a
stable and predictable economic environment for private sector planning and operations that go to
boost economic growth and employment. In addition, Sierra Leone, as in most LICs (although initial
conditions and the nature of policy challenges may differ across countries) structural impediments
to growth—(i) weak and unreliable infrastructure; (ii) institutional weaknesses; and (iii) low quality of
human capital—should be addressed through deep-going reforms. At the same time, effective
sectoral policies would be required, particularly in agriculture and mining, to promote economic
activity and create jobs.
26.

Low quality of human capital does not only limit labor employment opportunities in

the private sector but it also constraints public sector capacity. Public service delivery is
weakened by the brain drain experienced during the conflict, which resulted in the recruitment of a
large number of low-skilled labor force motivated by a poor political agenda. Furthermore, the drop
in educational standards and skills mismatch limits the capacity of new graduates in filling the
capacity gap. As a result, there remains a huge capacity gap in the public sector and most of the
technical jobs are secured by local and foreign consultants. This has warranted the need for urgent
civil service reform in order to enhance capacity for implementation of the Agenda for Change.
Some efforts have been made under the Free Healthcare Initiative with the increment of the salaries
for healthcare workers in 2010, but much remains to be done in other sectors, particularly within the
context of the new initiative to comprehensively reform public sector pay structure to promote the
attractiveness of public sector employment. The pay reform agenda of government is expected to
address the overhang from the period of near irrational employment in the public sector.
Specifically, the reform is expected to be implemented over a five-year period (2011–15) with the
following features: a) minimum wage pay policy, b) classification of jobs into job elements, c) a
composite clean wage structure, and d) a unified single spine salary structure.
27.

Building human capacity and addressing infrastructure bottlenecks would help boost

TFP and hence per capita real GDP growth and job creation. For now, total factor productivity
remains negative and two sectors (agriculture and mining) continue dominate economic activities.
Except for recent boom in FDI for iron ore mining in 2009–12, private sector participation in

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

101

SIERRA LEONE

economic activity remains generally low across all sectors of the economy mainly on account of the
high cost of doing business and other public sector inefficiencies.
28.

A robust social safety net and employment-enhancing labor market policies would be

necessary. While specific labor market initiatives such as on-the-job training and job placements for
qualified but unemployed youth would help enhance the chances of employment and employability
and promote inclusive growth, well-targeted social support or safety net would ensure access to a
decent living standard for all citizens.

D. Concluding Remarks
29.

Following the 2008 financial crisis and subsequent global economic slowdown, many

economies have weakened and unemployment has soared. These developments have
heightened the search for economic policies to help recovery of the global economy, create jobs,
and reduce poverty. For Sierra Leone, the quest for these goals transcends recent developments—it
has been there even prior to the onset of the civil conflict in 1991. The global economic slowdown,
coupled with increasing democratization and quest for social inclusiveness only heightened the
search for jobs and poverty reduction. Thus, initial conditions do matter.
30.

The literature underscores the role of economic institutions and policy in boosting

growth and reducing poverty. One lesson that Sierra Leone can take home from these findings is
the significance of sound macroeconomic policies that reduce inflation and create a predictable
economic environment for private sector growth. The quality of institutions matter too: progress
should be maintained in structural reforms focused at improving public sector efficiency, as well as
addressing the infrastructure gap and lapses in human development (i.e., in health, education, and
social support services generally). Initiatives in these areas should be complemented with
sector-specific interventions (for example, in the labor market) to boost economic growth and create
jobs. At the same time, a strengthening of the existing social protection floor would be required to
dampen the adverse impact of efficiency-enhancing economic policies on vulnerable households.

Safeguards Assessment:
The latest safeguards assessment for the Bank of Sierra Leone was completed on November 24,
2010. The assessment concluded that the BSL continues to maintain important elements of the
safeguards framework; financial statements are prepared and audited in accordance with
international standards and are published in a timely manner on the BSL website. Currently, the
BSL is still in the process of strengthening staff capacity in its internal audit function. The next
update will be completed by the first review of the proposed ECF arrangement.

3

Assistance committed under the original framework is expressed in net present value (NPV) terms at the
completion point, and assistance committed under the enhanced framework is expressed in NPV terms at the
decision point. Hence these two amounts cannot be added.
4

Under the enhanced framework, an additional disbursement is made at the completion point corresponding to
interest income earned on the amount committed at the decision point but not disbursed during the interim.

5

The MDRI provides 100 percent debt relief to eligible member countries that qualified for the assistance. Grant
assistance from the MDRI Trust and HIPC resources provide debt relief to cover the full stock of debt owed to the
Fund as of 2004 that remains outstanding at the time the member qualifies for debt relief.

Exchange Rate Arrangement:
For customs valuation purposes and for official transactions, the Bank of Sierra Leone (BSL)
calculates an official exchange rate every Friday morning as the weighted average of the auction
rate, the commercial bank mid-rate, and the bureau mid-rate in the previous week. Commercial
banks may buy foreign exchange from and sell it to individual customers and may trade among
themselves or with the BSL on a freely negotiable basis. As of October 3, 2013, the BSL mid rate was
Le 4,333.53=US$1.
Sierra Leone’s de jure exchange rate regime is classified as floating, with the value of the leone
determined by the market. Furthermore, effective November 1, 2008, the de facto exchange rate
arrangement has been reclassified to ‘floating’ from a ‘stabilized arrangement’.
With effect December 14, 1995, Sierra Leone has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2,
3, and 4, and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on the making of payments and
transfers for current international transactions. Sierra Leone maintains one multiple currency practice
subject to Fund jurisdiction arising from the applied multiple-price Dutch auction system, as there is
no formal mechanism in place to prevent spreads of effective rates between winning bids from
exceeding 2 percent.
Article IV Consultation:
The Executive Board concluded the 2010 Article IV consultation on December 6, 2010. The next
Article IV consultation will be held in accordance with the 2010 decision on consultation cycles.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
As of September 5, 2013
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance purposes. Data management advanced since the
end of the civil conflict that resulted in a virtual collapse of statistical systems in the late 1990s. However,
deficiencies still affect balance of payments (BOP) and international investment position (IIP) statistics, national
accounts, government finance statistics, and social indicators. A major and sustained improvement in the
coverage and timeliness of economic data will require greater interagency coordination and restructuring of
the institutional framework.
National Accounts: Improvements have been made in the compilation of construction, estimation of informal
sector activity, measurement of government services, agricultural production, household final consumption,
and constant price gross domestic product (GDP). Under a new DFID-funded project five technical assistance
missions have visited Freetown since 2010 to improve annual estimates of GDP. In 2012, national accounts
were rebased using 2006 prices. Remaining issues concern developing better data sources for agricultural and
mineral production, and generally continuing the improvement of informal sector measurement. However,
shortages of resources and staff continue to pose major constraints to the statistical development undertaken
by Statistics Sierra Leone (SSL).
Price Statistics: The SSL compiles the CPI monthly and publishes it with a lag of about three weeks. It has been
rebased to 2007 using the 2007 Sierra Leone integrated household survey and continues to cover the capital
city and three main districts. While a national CPI is being compiled, the authorities continue to publish the old
CPI (1992=100). The authorities have requested technical assistance for the preparation and adoption of a
single index.
Technical assistance missions visited Freetown in August 2012 to review the CPI and to advice on the
development of a producer price index (PPI). The authorities are working to improve the index calculation
methods for the CPI and procedures to aggregate regional CPIs to obtain the national index.
The Authorities have developed PPI weights, selected a representative sample of establishments, and selected
representative products and transaction for price collection. A work plan, in the form of Project Framework
Summary, was drafted for the preparation of the new PPI.
Government Finance Statistics: The budget reporting system was established with assistance from the
Fund/UNDP technical assistance project. Monthly cash flow data on central government revenue, current
expenditure, and financing are provided. The transaction coverage of the central government cash flow is
incomplete. There is an urgent need for more timely and accurate data on foreign-financed development
projects. Reports on implementation of the development budget and its financing are currently not produced
in a format that is suitable for budget analysis because the necessary data are not available.
The authorities are currently considering introduction of a flash reporting system for government expenditure
in general and for foreign aid-financed projects. As part of the GDDS regional project for Anglophone African
countries, work has been undertaken to reconcile fiscal and monetary data and to improve the coverage and
classification of the two data sets. With the current drive towards decentralization and the growing role of local
government, there is an urgent need to compile and monitor the operations (and financial balance sheet data)
for the consolidated general government.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SIERRA LEONE

Monetary and Financial Statistics: The main components of the central bank balance sheet are available daily
and weekly under the early warning system on key financial targets. The full monetary survey is compiled by
the Bank of Sierra Leone (BSL) with a lag of about six weeks; it has comprehensive coverage of commercial
banks.
Significant progress has been made by the BSL in the compilation of monetary data. The BSL, with assistance
from STA, has completed the migration to standardized report forms (SRFs) for the central bank and other
depository corporations (ODCs). However, there is a need to expand the coverage of monetary and financial
statistics by including data on other financial corporations.
External Sector Statistics: The BSL is responsible for compiling BOP and IIP statistics, which are currently
prepared on an annual basis. Primary data sources are administrative-based data (BSL own records,
government ministries, and Customs and Excise Department (Customs) records), partner-country and
international organizations data, and the annual survey of major companies for estimates on services, income,
and financial flows relating to direct, portfolio, and other investments.
External transactions are characterized by a large volume of activities in the informal sector. Trade data include
to some extent estimates for illegal or smuggled goods (unrecorded diamond exports are estimated by
deducting official diamonds export figures from trading partners’ official diamonds imports from Sierra Leone).
Coverage issues also exist for services, primary and secondary income, and capital and financial accounts.
Information on official grant and loan receipts is of generally good quality and is prepared by the IMF African
Department (AFR) staff on the basis of contact with the authorities and donor agencies. Data on private capital
flows are lacking; while information on financial transactions of banks are obtained directly from commercial
bank records. Entries are estimated as differences in amounts of outstanding foreign assets and liabilities of
commercial banks; thus, they may include valuation changes. Private financial flows, especially those linked to
the informal diamond trade, may also affect “errors and omissions.”
While the authorities are producing data on the IIP, the coverage as well as the consistency between BOP
financial account transactions and the IIP data needs to be improved.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Participant in the General Data Dissemination System
(GDDS) since 2003

No data ROSC is available.

III. Reporting to STA
Fiscal data are reported to AFR, but it is not disseminated in the International Financial Statistics. Data is
reported for publication in the Government Finance Statistics, with the most recent data referring to 2011.
The BSL started reporting monetary data in the SRF-format to the IMF in April 2010.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION AND REQUEST FOR A THREE-YEAR
ARRANGEMENT UNDER THE EXTENDED CREDIT
FACILITY—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Approved By

Michel Lazare and
Dhaneshwar Ghura (IMF)
and
Mark Roland Thomas and
Sudarshan Gooptu (IDA)

Prepared by the staff of the International Monetary Fund
and the World Bank.

Staff’s assessment of Sierra Leone’s debt sustainability indicates that the risk of debt
distress remains moderate.1 All debt indicators are below their policy-dependent
indicative thresholds under the baseline scenario.2 However, stress tests point to
vulnerability to adverse shocks affecting key macroeconomic variables, particularly
exports in view of Sierra Leone’s narrow export base. To contain the risk of debt distress
emanating from these shocks and support long-term debt sustainability, it is critical to
maintain prudent borrowing policies, sustain fiscal consolidation efforts, continue
implementation of growth-enhancing structural reforms, and promote economic
diversification. The authorities agreed with Staff’s assessment and policy
recommendations.

1

This Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) is based on the Debt Sustainability Framework (DSF) for low-income
countries (LICs), approved by the Executive Boards of the IMF and World Bank. It updates the previous joint
DSA dated September 5, 2012; and takes into account the recent decision by the Executive Boards of the IMF
and the WB to adopt a unified discount rate of 5 percent for the purpose of calculating the present value of
the external debt of LICs and assessing the concessionality of individual loans.

2

Sierra Leone is a medium performer under the World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment
(CPIA) classification, with an average rating of 3.28 for 2010–12. As a medium performer, the debt and
debt service thresholds under the joint IMF-WB DSF for LICs applied for Sierra Leone are: (i) 150 percent
for the Present Value (PV) of debt-to-exports ratio; (ii) 40 percent for the PV of debt-to-GDP ratio; and
(iii) 250 percent for the PV of debt-to-revenue ratio. The relevant thresholds for debt service are: (i) 20 percent
for debt service-to-exports ratio, and (ii) 20 percent for debt service-to-revenue ratio.

SIERRA LEONE

INTRODUCTION
1.
This debt sustainability analysis (DSA) updates the joint IMF-World Bank DSA
presented to the Boards of both institutions in September 2012 and uses a unified discount
rate of 5 percent to calculate the present value of external debt and assess concessionality.3
At that time, the DSA results showed that under the baseline scenario, all debt indicators were below
their respective policy-dependent indicative thresholds throughout the projection period (2012–32).
The analysis also indicated that the medium- to long-term debt outlook was vulnerable to adverse
shocks to several macroeconomic variables, notably exports, prices, foreign direct investment (FDI)
inflows, government revenue, and borrowing conditions. Although the long term macroeconomic
outlook is somewhat better than under the September 2012 DSA, the current analysis reaches the
same conclusion.

BACKGROUND AND ASSUMPTIONS
2.
The stock of public and publicly guaranteed external debt4 amounted to
US$0.98 billion at end-2012, and was mostly owed to multilateral creditors. It declined from
142 percent of GDP at end–2005 to 26 percent of GDP at end–2012, mainly reflecting the impact of
debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative (HIPC) and the Multilateral Debt
Relief Initiative (MDRI).5 Multilateral creditors account for the largest share of public and publicly
guaranteed debt; and debt to commercial creditors, estimated at US$221 million (23 percent of total
external debt), consists of arrears accumulated prior to and during the civil conflict. The authorities
have been making goodwill payments to some commercial creditors to avoid litigation, and they are
preparing a debt-buy-back operation with support from the World Bank. A road map to fast track
the process has been agreed upon and preparatory work could be initiated in 2014.
3.
Domestic debt amounted to 10.8 percent of GDP at end-2012, and 29.4 percent of
total public and publicly guaranteed debt. While there has been a trend decline in domestic debt
in relation to GDP, the portfolio has become increasingly concentrated in treasury securities, which
have increased from some 55 percent of total domestic debt end–2007 to 71 percent at end–2012.
The remaining domestic debt is comprised of the Government’s overdraft facility at the Bank of
Sierra Leone (BoSL), verified domestic payments arrears, and non-negotiable, non-interest bearing
securities held by the BoSL. The issuance of marketable securities rose sharply in 2012 as fiscal
slippages boosted borrowing needs. The new issuance was largely absorbed by commercial banks

Sierra Leone has received debt relief under the MDRI Initiatives from the IMF, IDA, AfDB, EIB, IFAD, BADEA, IDB, and
OPEC Fund. Under the HIPC Initiative, bilateral agreements have been signed with all participating creditors, except
China, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia.

and the non-bank public, which respectively held 69 percent and 20 percent of marketable securities
at end–2012. The authorities have actively sought to lengthen maturities by increasing issuance of
364-day treasury bills, which has increased the weighted average maturity from around 6 months at
end–2010 to 8.3 months at end–2012. Nonetheless, roughly half of the portfolio has a maturity of a
half year or less, highlighting significant rollover and refinancing risks. Domestic interest payments
increased from 1.4 percent of GDP in 2010 to 1.6 percent in 2012.
4.
The baseline macroeconomic assumptions underlying this DSA are summarized in
Box 1. The key changes from the previous DSA are as follows (Text Table 1):


Better growth prospects. Real GDP growth is expected to be higher than in the 2012 DSA,
reflecting a combination of a smoother iron ore production profile, and the authorities’ efforts
through their third-generation Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) to scale up public investment
and create a better business environment.



Weaker fiscal position. The current DSA assumes a higher primary deficit, particularly in the short
run, mostly because of the anticipated scaling up of infrastructure investment as the
implementation of the new PRS starts in 2014.



Higher external borrowing. The current DSA assumes a higher level of external borrowing, in line
with the implementation of the new PRSP. It also provides some room for nonconcessional
borrowing for priority projects.



Stronger external position. In the current DSA, the external current account deficit is expected to
be stronger in the medium-to-long run, mostly due to better export prospects in extractive
industries and agriculture.

Box 1. Baseline Macroeconomic Assumptions


The economy is expected to grow by 13.3 percent in 2013, and by an average rate of about 9 percent
for 2014–18, driven by public investment scaling up in the context of the authorities’ new PRS, iron ore
production and output expansion in agriculture. Over the long-term, growth would moderate to about
5.5 percent.



Inflation is projected to decline to single-digit levels starting in 2014. Assuming that monetary policy will
remain prudent and fiscal consolidation efforts will be sustained, the twelve-month inflation rate would
decline from 12 percent in 2012 to 9 percent in 2013; and hover around 5.5 percent over the long-term.



The overall fiscal deficit is projected to improve over the medium-to-long term, with the domestic
primary deficit forecast to decline from 3.4 percent of GDP in 2012 to 1.6 percent in 2018; and to
stabilize at that level during 2019–2033. Revenue and grants are projected to remain in the
15–16 percent of GDP range during the projection period, as a modest increase in revenue compensates
for the projected decline in grants. Primary (non-interest) expenditure is projected to decline from
18.7 percent of GDP in 2012 to roughly 15.5 percent over the medium term, reflecting a break with past
spending patterns as fiscal consolidation takes hold.



The external current account deficit is forecast to narrow over the medium-to-long-term consistent with
the projected increase in iron ore and other exports, as well as favorable terms of trade. Import
dynamics broadly reflect the projected overall real GDP growth.



New external loans are projected to average 2.3 percent of GDP over the medium-term and long term,
consistent with the authorities’ objectives under the new PRS. The DSA also assumes some
nonconcessional borrowing limited at 0.5 percent of GDP (US$30 million) per year, during the projection
period to finance key priority projects for which the authorities would not be able to secure
concessional funding.



Domestic debt is projected to decline from 11 percent of GDP in 2013, to 10 percent by the end of the
projection period, consistent with the expected improvement in the fiscal position.



4

This period of fiscal consolidation does not see the emergence of broader fiscal risks.

EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
5.
The external DSA indicates that Sierra Leone is at a moderate risk of debt distress,
similar to the conclusion of the previous DSA. Under the baseline scenario, all debt indicators
remain well below their respective policy-dependent indicative thresholds (Figure 1 and Table 1)
during the projection period. Nonetheless, as in the previous DSA, there is a rising trend in all
indicators, during the period 2019–33, consistent with a steady increase in debt accumulation and a
conservative assumption on future iron ore production. Debt service ratios are expected to remain
significantly below their relevant policy-dependent indicative thresholds, partly reflecting the decline
in Sierra Leone’s debt burden thanks to past debt relief initiatives, and the favorable impact of iron
ore production on exports and government revenue.
6.
Stress tests results highlight Sierra Leone’s vulnerability to adverse exogenous shocks
affecting exports, exchange rate, and borrowing terms (Figure 1 and Table 2). The most extreme
shock stemming from lower export growth6 shows a greater impact on debt indicators related to
exports and government revenue. The PV of debt-to-exports ratio rises continuously over the
medium to long term, but stabilizes at the policy-dependent threshold during 2025–33. This is
consistent with the structural break in key macroeconomic variables created by the onset of largescale iron ore production in 2012. The PV of debt-to-revenue ratio, although elevated, remains
below the indicative threshold, and trends downward after an initial increase in 2014–15. Since
revenue performance is projected to strengthen in the long run, the increase in vulnerability on
revenue compared with the baseline scenario is triggered by the impact of the shock on borrowing.
Compared with the 2012 DSA, the improvement in Sierra Leone’s ranking to medium performer, and
the use of the new discount rate of 5 percent recently adopted by the IMF and World Bank Executive
Boards also contributes to a better long-term debt outlook. Under the alternative scenarios
involving a one-time 30 percent nominal depreciation in 2014, additional external borrowing on less
favorable borrowing terms,7 or a combination of the abovementioned shocks, all debt indicators
increase continuously through 2033 while remaining under their indicative thresholds.

PUBLIC SECTOR DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
7.
DSA results for total public sector debt indicate that there are no significant
vulnerabilities linked to domestic debt (Figure 2 and Table 3). Under the baseline scenario, the PV
of public debt-to-GDP and to revenue ratios are both expected to modestly increase in the long run,
consistent with results from the external DSA. Stress tests point to vulnerability to shocks affecting
economic growth (See Figure 2 and Table 4): under an alternative scenario assuming a real GDP
growth shock,8 both the PV of public debt-to-GDP ratio and the PV of public debt-to-revenue ratio
6

The shock is defined as the exports value growth at historical average minus one standard deviation in 2014–15.

7
This scenario assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is 200 basis points higher than in the baseline
scenario, while the grace period and the maturity are the same as in the baseline scenario.
8

This scenario assumes that real GDP growth is at baseline minus one standard deviation in 2014–15.

would increase continuously through 2033 with the former reaching 50 percent in 2033 (27 percent
under the baseline scenario) and the latter rising to 309 percent (171 percent under the baseline
scenario).

CONCLUSIONS
8.
Sierra Leone remains at a moderate risk of debt distress. This assessment is similar to
that reached under the September 2012 DSA. In the baseline scenario, all debt indicators remain
below their respective policy-dependent indicative thresholds throughout the projection period.
However, results for alternative scenarios show that, although debt indicators remain below their
indicative thresholds during the projection period, the long-term debt outlook is vulnerable to
various shocks that could conceivably lead to a breach of thresholds, particularly for exports. An
additional source of vulnerability is the short-term maturity structure of public domestic debt, which
creates roll-over risks. To support long-term debt sustainability it will be important for the
authorities to enhance revenue collection, particularly in the non-mineral economy, strengthen
expenditure and debt management, implement growth-enhancing policies, promote export
diversification, and maintain prudent borrowing policies.
9.
The authorities agreed with staff’s assessment, and reiterated the call for more
flexibility in borrowing conditions to facilitate access to nonconcessional borrowing for
priority projects.

Includes both public and private sector external debt.
Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline, while grace and maturity periods same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level
after the shock (implicitly assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

2/ Gross financing need is defined as the primary deficit plus debt service plus the stock of short-term debt at the end of the last period.
3/ Revenues excluding grants.
4/ Debt service is defined as the sum of interest and amortization of medium and long-term debt.
5/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.

Washington, D.C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Approves Three-Year, US$95.9 Million ECF Arrangement for
Sierra-Leone
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today approved a three-year
arrangement under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) for Sierra Leone in an amount equivalent to
SDR 62.22 million (about US$95.9 million). The overall amount of the program represents 60 percent
of Sierra Leone’s quota in the IMF and enables the immediate disbursement of SDR 8.89 million
(about US$13.7 million). The ECF-supported program seeks to underpin the government’s economic
program and aims to facilitate high-quality public investment and growth enhancing reforms in the
context of macroeconomic stability.
The Executive Board also concluded the 2013 Article IV consultations with Sierra Leone, which will be
detailed in a separate press release in due course.
Following the Executive Board’s discussion, Mr. Min Zhu, Deputy Managing Director and Acting
Chair, made the following statement.
“Sierra Leone has achieved strong macroeconomic gains in recent years. Bolstered by iron
production, economic growth has been robust, while inflation has been falling on the back of a tight
monetary stance, a stable exchange rate, and lower food prices. The medium-term outlook is
favorable, with policy focused on achieving strong broad-based growth, further disinflation, and an
improved external position.
“Continued efforts will be needed to strengthen policy implementation, particularly in the fiscal area.
The authorities’ plans to strengthen public financial management appropriately aim to enhance
revenue mobilization, improve spending controls, and reduce domestic debt. Key revenue
components in their fiscal strategy include improvements in tax administration, reductions in tax
exemptions, and the adoption of a comprehensive fiscal regime for the natural resources sector.
Timely implementation of these reforms will be critical to buttress macroeconomic stability and the
credibility of fiscal policy.
“The new Fund-supported program aims to underpin the authorities’ development and povertyreduction strategy. This strategy aims at entrenching macroeconomic stability and promoting
inclusive growth through further infrastructure investments and economic diversification. The
program calls for continued fiscal consolidation, strong monetary and exchange rate policies to
support the single-digit inflation target, prudent borrowing policies, and growth-enhancing
structural reforms.”
ANNEX

Recent economic developments
Sierra Leone has made significant progress in the implementation of the ECF-supported program
that was cancelled prior to its expiration at end-June. Reform measures and policies put in place
have helped improve macroeconomic stability, advance social policies, and enhance prospects for
broad and inclusive growth.
Economic growth accelerated and inflation declined in 2012. Real GDP growth is estimated at
15.2 percent, reflecting increased iron ore production, from 137,000 tons in 2011 to 6.6 million tons
in 2012. Non-iron ore growth is estimated at 5.3 percent (5.8 percent in 2011), driven by output
expansion in agriculture, manufacturing, construction, and services. In agriculture growth has been
sustained since 2010 with the introduction of the government and donor-supported Small Holder
Commercialization Program (SHCP).
Good progress has been made in containing consumer price inflation, and price pressures have
eased. Inflation declined from 16.9 percent at end-2011 to 12 percent at end-2012, and 9.1 percent
at end-September 2013. A significant increase in foreign direct investment flows during 2011 and
2012 has led to a surge in investment-driven imports, and helped finance the resultant external
current account deficit. Revenue collection reached 12.2 percent of non-iron ore GDP compared with
11.5 percent in 2011 reflecting higher than anticipated taxes from the extractive sector that helped
compensate for weak performance in other tax categories.
In spite of the progress noted, the country faces important challenges. Poverty, and unemployment
are still high, and access to public and social services is limited. In addition, growth prospects are
hindered by numerous obstacles, including insufficient power supply and road networks, and limited
access to financial services, particularly for the small and medium-sized enterprises (SME).
Program and key medium term policy objectives
Although significant progress has been made since the end of the civil conflict toward social stability
and a sustainable macroeconomic position, Sierra Leone needs more durable poverty reduction and
growth efforts. The government intends to address remaining challenges and accelerate Sierra
Leone’s development through steadfast implementation of the new Poverty Reduction Strategy, the
Agenda for Prosperity (AfP). The ECF-supported program seeks to underpin this effort by facilitating
high quality public investment and growth enhancing reforms in a stable macroeconomic
environment.
The medium-term objectives are to: (i) achieve a real GDP growth (excluding iron ore) of 7 percent
by 2017; (ii) reduce inflation from 12 percent in 2012 to about 5.4 percent by 2017; and (iii) improve
gross reserve coverage to about 4 months of non iron-ore related imports by the end of the
program period.
Economic growth will be driven by continued public investment scaling up, increased productivity,
notably in agriculture, and sustained activity in construction and services. Non-iron ore activity will
also benefit from upstream activity in iron ore mining where production (under phase I of the largest
mine) is expected to increase through 2015, and level off starting in 2016. Inflation is projected to
decline from 9 percent in 2013 to 5.4 percent in 2017, on account of continued prudent monetary
and exchange rate policies. In addition, monetary policy would be adequately calibrated to contain

inflationary pressures, and macro-prudential measures would be geared towards a healthy expansion
of private credit.
The government’s medium-term fiscal strategy aims to strengthen revenue collection, improve
expenditure management, and reduce domestic debt. Revenue performance will be supported by
continuing sustained economic activity in the non-iron ore economy, and the projected increase in
royalties from the mineral sector. The government will continue implementing measures needed to
improve public financial management, notably to enhance expenditure commitment monitoring and
capital expenditure management.
Monetary policy will continue to target price stability over the medium term. The Bank of Sierra
Leone recognizes the need to build up foreign exchange reserves in light of the economy’s
vulnerability to external shocks. It will also actively pursue initiatives aimed at strengthening the
financial system.
The government intends to accelerate implementation of structural reforms to support private sector
development and enhance growth prospects in the non-mineral economy. In this regard, the
government plans to rehabilitate the Bumbuna hydroelectric power plant and thermal power
generators to increase energy supply; complete the teacher biometric verification exercise and the
civil service remuneration survey; and implement measures to strengthen the Public Service
Commission. It also intends to establish an SME Fund to finance new centers for training and skills
development, including business management, accounting, and project design and introduce a onestop window for imports clearance.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
November 14, 2013

International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes the 2013 Article IV Consultation with Sierra Leone
On October 21, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Sierra Leone,1 and approved a three–year arrangement under the
Extended Credit Facility (ECF) in support of the authorities’ economic and financial program for
2013–2016 (see Press Release No. 13/410).
Sierra Leone has made significant progress in macroeconomic stabilization over the last five
years. Real Gross Domestic Product growth averaged some 7 percent, driven by output
expansion in agriculture, mining, and services; as well as the scaling-up of infrastructure
investment. Nonetheless, important impediments to broad-based growth remain, including
large infrastructure gaps, insufficient energy supply, and limited access to safe water and
sanitation.
To address the country’s remaining challenges, the authorities have prepared a new Poverty
Reduction Strategy–Agenda for Prosperity–that focuses on measures to advance economic
diversification, improve public service delivery and social protection for the most vulnerable, and
increase employment opportunities. The new strategy aims to achieve economic transformation
through increased investment in energy, roads, transportation, and agriculture; as well as
growth-enhancing structural reforms.
Recent economic and financial developments were encouraging. The inflation rate (year-onyear) declined from 12.1 percent in 2012 to 9.1 percent at end-September 2013, partly reflecting
a tighter monetary policy stance. With the onset of iron ore exports, and better terms of trade,
the external position improved in 2012, and gross international reserves rose to about 3 months
of imports. The fiscal deficit stood at 5.6 percent of non-iron ore GDP in 2012, well above the
original budget target because of expenditure overruns partly linked to the November elections.
However, the fiscal position improved in the first half of 2013 thanks to revenue-enhancing

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director,
as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:

measures, expenditure restraint, and enhanced Treasury cash management. Monetary and
banking sector developments have been broadly satisfactory and risks to financial sector
stability appear contained.
Medium-term prospects are positive. Growth is projected to remain robust, mainly driven by
iron ore production and continued high public investment; while inflation is expected to decline
further as monetary and fiscal policies remain prudent. The main risks to the outlook are related
to possible adverse fluctuations in global commodity prices and uncertainties on iron ore
production.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the progress made by Sierra Leone in recent years but noted that
poverty remains widespread and improvement in social indicators has been modest.
Accordingly, Directors emphasized that strong commitment to sound policies and structural
reforms under the new ECF-supported program will be important to consolidate
macroeconomic stability, build policy buffers, and foster sustainable and inclusive growth.
Directors stressed the importance of continued efforts to strengthen the fiscal position. They
welcomed the authorities’ renewed focus on revenue mobilization and their plans to improve
expenditure controls and avoid further spending overruns. They looked forward to the
authorities’ medium-term expenditure framework which should guide the implementation of the
new Poverty Reduction Strategy, including giving priority to infrastructure investment and
pro-poor spending. To boost revenue, Directors called for measures to increase efficiency in tax
administration, broaden the tax base, and establish a comprehensive tax regime for the natural
resources sector. Accelerating public financial reforms should help strengthen budget processes
and expenditure management, especially management of capital expenditure.
Directors welcomed efforts to improve debt management capacity and urged the authorities to
continue to cover Sierra Leone’s financing needs mainly with grants and concessional loans.
They also called for a careful prioritization of large-scale infrastructure projects envisioned in
their Poverty Reduction Strategy. Directors advised the authorities to ensure that large projects
are consistent with macroeconomic stability and debt sustainability.
Directors encouraged the authorities to maintain a tight monetary policy to reduce inflation
further. The monetary authorities should stand ready to raise the policy rate and mop up excess
liquidity, if inflationary pressures intensify. Given Sierra Leone’s vulnerability to external shocks,
Directors saw merit in increasing international reserves over the medium term and maintaining a
flexible exchange rate.
Directors noted that, while the financial sector has expanded significantly, the provision of
financial services remains limited. They encouraged the authorities to take additional steps to
broaden access and facilitate intermediation. Addressing gaps in banking supervision and

strengthening the Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT)
framework will also be important.
Directors emphasized that deeper structural reforms remain necessary to foster broad-based
growth and reduce poverty. Key priorities should focus on improving the business environment,
investing in infrastructure, including energy sector, and advancing economic diversification.

Statement by Momodou Bamba Saho, Executive Director for Sierra Leone
October 21, 2013
Background
1.
The implementation of successive Fund-supported financing arrangements under the
Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust, following the end of the civil conflict in 2002, has helped
Sierra Leone maintain macroeconomic stability and return to a high and sustainable growth
trajectory. In spite of the daunting challenges posed by adverse exogenous shocks from the global
food and fuel crisis and the global financial crisis, the Sierra Leone authorities successfully completed
implementation of their poverty reduction strategy (PRS), the ‘Agenda for Change’, spanning
2008–2012. Significant progress was accomplished in the delivery of public services, the deepening
of the financial sector, the strengthening of state institutions, and in reducing poverty.
2.
To consolidate the progress made thus far, the authorities have commenced the process of
addressing the residual socio-economic challenges and accelerating the country’s development
through steadfast implementation of a successor PRS, the ‘Agenda for Prosperity’ (AfP). The AfP
defines the country’s development path for the period 2013–18, with the key objective of attaining
inclusive, diversified, and sustainable economic growth, in tandem with employment generation and
significantly reducing income inequality. To advance these objectives, the authorities decided to
negotiate a new Fund arrangement that is aligned with the priorities set out in the AfP. It is against
this background that my authorities request the Executive Board’s approval of a new three-year
program supported under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF).
3.
My authorities appreciate the continued support of the Executive Board and Management
throughout the years, including in the area of technical assistance. They are particularly grateful for
the productive policy dialogue and advice proffered by the staff team during the negotiations for a
new ECF arrangement. Mindful of the many challenges going forward, continued engagement with
the Fund and other development partners is considered crucial to sustaining the growth momentum
and reducing poverty. My authorities broadly share the thrust of the staff report, which they consider
a balanced account of recent economic developments and policy challenges going forward.
Recent economic developments
4.
Macroeconomic performance in 2013 has so far been impressive, with declining inflationary
pressures, stable exchange rate, improving current account position, and sustainable public debt
levels. Real GDP growth is projected at about 13.3 percent in 2013, driven mostly by increasing
value-added from iron ore production. The non-iron ore economy is also projected to register a
healthy 6 percent growth, with key contributions from agriculture, services, tourism, and sustained
investment in infrastructure.
5.
To address the fiscal slippages and domestic debt overhang which had come to characterize
budget execution in recent years, my authorities instituted stringent measures to ensure fiscal
discipline. A policy stance of zero domestic securities market borrowing was adopted; outstanding
arrears, including ways and means advances carried over from the previous year, were cleared; a
memorandum of understanding was signed with commercial banks to reduce delays in transferring

balances on the National Revenue Authority’s transit accounts to the Treasury account at the central
bank; and a decision was taken to terminate the 2013 expenditure commitments and issuance of
payment orders at end-October and end-November, respectively, with a view to limit float
transactions at the end of the year. Fiscal consolidation was rigorously pursued, through enhanced
revenue mobilization and expenditure control. Total domestic revenue mobilized during the first half
of 2013 amounted to 6.3 percent of GDP, exceeding the target for the period and actual collections
for the corresponding period in 2012. Total expenditures and net lending, on the other hand,
amounted to 6.8 percent of GDP, well within the budgeted amount of 7.5 percent of GDP.
6.
The tight fiscal management in the first half of the year occasioned partly by the authorities’
zero domestic borrowing stance, culminated in the significant decline in domestic interest rates
translating into substantial savings in interest payments, thereby creating much needed fiscal space
for productive spending. The 3-month Treasury bills rate plummeted to 5.4 percent at end-June 2013
from 19.0 percent in December 2012. Similarly, the Treasury bearer bonds rate fell to 9 percent at
end-June 2013 from 20 percent in December 2012. Accordingly, the monetary policy rate was
lowered from 20 percent to 15 percent. Inflationary pressures have continued to moderate with
consumer price inflation falling to 9.3 percent (year-on-year) at end-August from 12 percent in
December 2012. The decline reflects moderation in international food and fuel prices, the relative
stability of the exchange rate, and pro-active monetary policy supported by fiscal restraint. The
country’s gross international reserves amounted to about 3 months of import coverage by
end-August 2013.
Medium-term outlook and policies
7.
The policy interventions over the medium term will be defined by the priorities outlined in
the AfP. Over the period, policy will focus on preserving macroeconomic stability and strengthening
public finances, while promoting private-sector, export-led growth and generating employment
opportunities.
8.
The growth prospects over the medium term are quite favorable, with real GDP growth
averaging 10.5 percent, driven mostly by increased iron ore mining activities. Excluding iron ore,
growth is projected to attain 7 percent by 2017 on account of continued scaling up of public
investment, increased agricultural productivity, and sustained activity in construction and services.
Exports are projected to increase significantly over the period culminating in the narrowing of the
current account deficit by 13 percentage points of non-iron ore GDP. With the improved external
current account coupled with unremitting capital inflows, gross international reserves is expected to
increase from 3.2 months of imports in 2013 to 4.1 months by 2017. Inflation is projected to decline
from 9 percent in 2013 to 5.4 percent in 2017 on the back of a stable exchange rate and continued
prudent monetary policy.
Fiscal policy and public financial management
9.
The authorities’ demonstrable commitment to prudent fiscal management will underpin their
fiscal strategy over the medium term. The efforts at fiscal consolidation will be sustained through
enhanced domestic revenue mobilization, increased efficiency in expenditure management, and a
reduction in the stock of domestic debt. On the revenue front, my authorities will seek to broaden
the tax base, minimize discretionary duty exemptions, and strengthen revenue administration. The

legal, operational and institutional framework for efficient management of mining revenues will be
strengthened. Amendments to the Government Budgeting and Accountability Act (GBAA) will be
effected to provide for the establishment of a Natural Resource Revenue Fund and the incorporation
of a countercyclical fiscal rule that regulates budgetary utilization of natural resource revenues.
10.
On expenditures, the authorities will continue to restrain non-statutory recurrent
expenditures while rationalizing capital spending, with increased allocations to priority sectors
consistent with the country’s AfP. Public financial management reforms and fiscal governance will
continue to be strengthened within the context of the Integrated Public Financial Management
Programme (IPFMRP). The further roll out of the Integrated Financial Management Information
System (IFMIS) to government ministries, departments and agencies (MDAs) and the Petra financial
management information system to local councils will strengthen budget preparation, budget
execution, cash management and financial reporting. The establishment of a Treasury Single Account
and improvement in the operational efficiency of the Cash Management Committee constitute
important priorities going forward. In addition, my authorities will work on operationalizing the
recently established Public Investment Management Unit (PIMU) with a view to expediting
preparation of a public investment plan (PIP) that is fully integrated with the budget process and
consistent with the MTEF.
Debt management policy
11.
The Sierra Leone authorities intend to fast-track preparation of a comprehensive MediumTerm Debt Management Strategy (MTDS) that prioritizes the use of grants and highly concessional
resources for project financing. Given the daunting challenges of securing concessional external
financing for critical transformative infrastructure and social development projects outlined under the
country’s AfP, they would appreciate flexibility under the new ECF-supported program for the
financing, on nonconcessional terms, of some socially and economically viable projects for which
concessional funding could not be secured.
12.
The latest update of staffs’ debt sustainability analysis which affirms that Sierra Leone
remains at a moderate risk of debt distress is welcomed. Mindful of the vulnerability of the long-term
debt outlook to adverse shocks affecting key macroeconomic variables and roll-over risks from the
short-term maturity structure of public domestic debt, my authorities agree with the policy
prescriptions proffered by staff and will seek to maintain prudent borrowing policies.
Monetary and exchange rate policies
13.
Monetary policy will continue to be implemented within the context of the monetary
targeting framework which has proven to be appropriate in achieving price stability. To further
enhance the efficacy of monetary policy in containing potential inflationary pressures and in
attaining and maintaining single-digit inflation levels, the liquidity forecasting and management
framework of the Bank of Sierra Leone (BSL) will be further strengthened. Efforts to deepen the
secondary market and the interbank market for government securities will be enhanced in order to
amplify the signaling effect and thus the monetary policy transmission mechanism.

14.
The current flexible exchange rate regime will be maintained over the medium term to help
facilitate rapid adjustments to exogenous shocks. The BSL’s intervention in the foreign exchange
market will continue to be limited to smoothening short-term exchange rate volatility. Going
forward, the BSL will introduce new measures in the management of foreign exchange to ensure
greater efficiency in the functioning of the inter-bank foreign exchange market, prevent loss of
foreign exchange reserves and limit potential risk to liquidity and exchange rate volatility. This would
include a new guideline for foreign exchange operations as well as a revised Foreign Exchange Act.
Financial sector reforms
15.
The resilience of the financial sector to adverse domestic and external shocks will be further
enhanced through effective implementation of the Financial Sector Development Plan (FSDP) that
aims, amongst others, to safeguard financial sector stability, improve efficiency in financial
intermediation, and expand access to financial services. The supervisory framework of the banking
system will continue to be reinforced, including through an accelerated transition to risk-based
supervision and full implementation of the Basel II Core Principles. Moreover, efforts will be made to
strengthen the legal framework of the financial sector by instituting appropriate prudential
regulations including enactment, over the near term, of the Borrowers and Lenders Bill, the Securities
and Exchange Bill, and the Collective Investment Bill. Progress accomplished in modernizing the
payments system will be further consolidated. With the promotion of financial inclusion an
overarching medium-term goal, the BSL will work closely with development partners and fulfill its
commitments under the Maya Declaration to the Alliance for Financial Inclusion geared towards
scaling up access to financial services.
Other structural reforms
16.
My authorities consider far-reaching structural reforms critical to the successful
implementation of the new ECF-supported program and to achieving their medium-term objective
as stated in the AfP. To this end, in addition to the structural fiscal and financial sector reform
measures highlighted above, they will, over the near to medium term, seek to consolidate progress
accomplished in modernizing the business regulatory framework and eliminating administrative
barriers to investment; boost energy supply by rehabilitating the Bumbuna hydroelectric power plant
and thermal power generators; achieve the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative-compliant
status by expediting the validation exercise; and strengthen the public procurement process by
ensuring transparency in procurement activities and information dissemination, including through
online access to procurement opportunities and contract awards.
The Agenda for Prosperity
17.
As highlighted above, my authorities have embarked on a program of socio-economic
transformation and development through judicious implementation of the AfP, on which the new
ECF-supported program is to be predicated. While addressing the country’s huge infrastructure
deficit remains an integral part of the strategy, my authorities will maintain close engagement with
development partners, notably the IMF and the World Bank, in assessing the economic feasibility and
macroeconomic impacts of the financing options for key transformative projects prior to their
implementation.

18.
Finally, my authorities have initiated a series of global road shows to sensitize development
partners and potential investors about the funding requirements and available investment
opportunities in the country. A Consultative Group meeting and Investment Forum will be organized
in Freetown later this year to effectively mobilize the resources needed to finance key projects
identified under the AfP. My authorities count on the continued support of development partners in
fulfilling the development aspirations of the people of Sierra Leone.
