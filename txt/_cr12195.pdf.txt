STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
July 6, 2012

KEY ISSUES
Context. The economy seems to be undergoing a soft landing, though global headwinds
are increasing. Growth is expected to moderate to around 8 percent this year and inflation
to drop to 3½ percent. Meanwhile, a political transition is underway.
Focus. Near-term macroeconomic management challenges were a key focus of the
consultation. The economy has been slowing partly as a result of policy action to moderate
growth to a more sustainable pace, but a worsening of the euro area crisis poses a key risk
to the outlook. The mission also discussed domestic risks related to the property sector,
financial system, and local government finances. Another theme related to the mediumterm priority of internally rebalancing the economy toward consumption. Finally, the
mission also exchanged views on inward and outward spillovers, with particular attention
to how China’s investment impacts the rest of the world.
Macroeconomic policy advice. Policies should continue to be geared toward achieving
this year’s growth targets. In the event of a worsening of the external outlook, China has
ample room to respond forcefully, using fiscal policy as the main line of defense and with
emphasis on measures that support China’s medium-term reform objectives.
Internal rebalancing. The significant reduction in the current account surplus since its
peak in 2007 is welcome, but this external rebalancing has been achieved at the cost of
rising internal imbalances. China’s growth has become increasingly dependent on
investment, a pattern that will be difficult to sustain. Therefore, there is a need to accelerate
progress in transforming the economic growth model to be more reliant on consumer
demand. Such a transformation would substantially boost living standards and make
growth more balanced, inclusive, and sustainable.
External assessment. The renminbi is assessed to be moderately undervalued, reflecting a
reassessment of the underlying current account, slower international reserves
accumulation, and past real effective exchange rate appreciation.

Box 1. Demographics—Has China Reached the Lewis Turning Point?
An abundant supply of low-cost rural labor has been
a key feature of China’s economy. But do reports of
wage inflation and labor shortages mean that this era
is coming to an end? Staff analysis suggests not yet,
but structural demographic factors indicate that
China will approach the Lewis Turning Point (LTP) by
the end of the decade.
Demographics
China is experiencing a rapid demographic change.
In addition to the projected decline in the labor
force post-2015, the old-age dependency ratio is
expected to increase at an almost unprecedented
rate over the coming decades, from about 13½
percent in 2010 to around 20 percent in 2020 and
around 28 percent in 2030. The rural old-age
dependency ratio will rise to over 34 by 2030 (World
Bank China 2030 Report).

China will continue to benefit from excess

A simultaneous equation disequilibrium model of
the labor market is used to gauge the current level
of excess labor supply.1 The result is used to project
the path of excess labor supply based on China’s
fundamentals (including demographics, household
wealth, labor market characteristics, productivity,
and external demand) and to determine the
approximate period during which China will cross
the LTP. Alternative assumptions are used to assess

 Higher fertility rates (such as by relaxing the onechild policy) would induce a positive, albeit small,
delay in crossing the LTP, as it will translate into a
larger labor force but only with a significant passage
of time.
 Raising labor force participation rates (such as by
granting migrant workers urban residency permits
and easier access to subsidized housing, schooling,
and healthcare in their city of residence) would
move the LTP to after 2025, assuming a
4 percentage point rise in participation relative the
2010 rate.
 Financial sector reform could accelerate reaching
the LTP. Interest rate liberalization that permanently
lifts deposit rates would raise net household wealth
and thus induce a reduction in the supply of labor as
households find it less attractive to work.
 An increase in total factor productivity (by raising
competition in the service sector and improving the
efficiency of investment) would boost output, cause
firms to demand more labor, and reduce the
effective supply of labor.

PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA 2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Box 2. Recent Interest Rate Reform
On June 7 and July 5, 2012, the People’s Bank of China
(PBC) announced (i) reductions in benchmark interest
rates and (ii) changes to the margins around
benchmark renminbi deposit and lending interest rates:
 Reduction of benchmark rates. The one-year

benchmark deposit rate was lowered by a cumulative
50 basis points (to 3 percent), and the lending rate by
56 basis points (to 6 percent). These were the first
reductions since the second half of 2008. Adjustments
were also made to benchmark interest rates on
deposits and loans of other maturities, as well as
deposit and lending interest rates of the personal
housing provident fund.
 New margin on deposit rate. The maximum
deposit interest rate was allowed to be 10 percent
above the benchmark rate, whereas previously it could
not be set above the benchmark. As a result, the
highest possible one-year deposit interest rate was
reduced from 3.5 percent to 3.3 percent (10 percent
above the new 3.0 percent benchmark).

 Larger reduction in minimum lending rate. The

minimum lending interest rate, previously at 90 percent
of the benchmark rate, was lowered to 70 percent. The
minimum one-year lending interest rate therefore
declined from 5.9 percent to 4.2 percent.
 Minimum margin considerably smaller. As a

result, the margin between the minimum lending
interest rate and the maximum deposit interest rate at
the one-year tenor has been narrowed by 150 basis
points, from 240 basis points to 90 basis points.

noted that the euro area crisis was already

activity and potentially pro-cyclical fiscal
policy in the United States were also cited as

balanced approach between fiscal and
monetary measures, designed to safeguard
the official growth target of 7½ percent for
2012 while avoiding the build-up of future
imbalances. They highlighted that rising real
interest rates and the still-high reserve
requirements provided space for a further
monetary response. By ensuring healthy
domestic consumption and investment
growth, China would continue to contribute
significantly to global economic stability.

Box 3. The Spillover Effects of a Downturn in China’s Real Estate Investment1
Real estate investment accounts for a quarter of total
fixed asset investment in China. This box examines the
spillover effects of an independent decline in China’s real
estate investment on a large set of macroeconomic, labor,
financial, and trade indicators in China and its G20 trading
partners as well as global commodity prices. The interaction
between China and the rest of the G20 is captured by a tworegion factor-augmented VAR (FAVAR), based on monthly
data during 2000M1-2011M9.

China’s G20 trading partners, which would result in global
output loss of 0.06 percent. Trading partners face a direct
impact on exports of machinery, equipment, and
commodities following a downturn in China’s real estate
investment. This initial impact is further amplified through
second-round effects on domestic demand.

Domestic Impacts. Following a decline in real estate
investment, activity would fall in a broad range of sectors,
given the real estate industry’s strong backward linkages to
other domestic industries (such as consumer durables,
construction, light industry, electricity). Weakening domestic
demand would depress China’s imports and, in turn, impact
trading partners’ production, employment and domestic
demand. As a (second-round) result, China’s exports would
weaken. The fall in China’s imports reflects robust linkages
of real estate activity to domestic industries that require
inputs from abroad on top of a significant share of
processing trade in total trade (see Fig. 1). Consumption
would weaken as income and wealth decline. Total industrial
value added and output would fall, with impact starting to
dissipate after 4 quarters. The overall slowdown is reflected
in the stock market as well as employment conditions. As
demand conditions deteriorate, property transaction
volume and price would also fall.
Global Spillover. Capital goods manufacturers that have
sizable direct exposure to China, especially Korea and Japan,
and those that are highly integrated with the rest of the
G20—therefore sharing adverse feedback (second-round
impact) from a negative shock in China with other trading
partners, such as Germany and Japan—would experience a
larger slowdown in industrial production and GDP (see
Fig. 2). All in all, a 1-percent decline in China’s real estate
investment would shave about 0.2 percent off China’s real
GDP within the first year, with negative spillover impacts to

Global trade activity would weaken, which implies that
economies that derive significant benefit from global trade
expansion and have indirect links with China via supply
chain countries over the past decade, such as Germany and
Japan, would be harder hit in the second round.

Remark: A one-standard-deviation decline in growth is equivalent to 2percent decline in real estate investment levels from baseline

Worsened global growth prospects would be reflected in
falling asset prices and sovereign bond spreads (except the
United States, where the initial flattening of the yield curve
is reversed after around two quarters, pointing to better
recovery prospects compared to other G20 economies).
Global growth slowdown and a drop in China’s demand for
base metal imports would lead to a drop in the international
prices of iron ore, aluminum, copper, lead, nickel, and zinc
(see Table 1). The impact on overall metal prices could last
4 quarters, with up to 5–6 quarters for lead and zinc,
possibly due to weaker supply response.

Bank asset quality. The side effects of

the last stimulus are still winding their way
through the economy. As a result, there is a
clear risk of deterioration in bank asset quality,
which would be amplified in a lower-growth
scenario. As suggested by the Financial Sector
Assessment Program (FSAP) stress tests, and
corroborated by new stress tests conducted by
the authorities at the end of 2011, the risk to
the overall banking system appears
manageable under most scenarios. Reported
data indicate that bank balance sheets are
generally healthy, with provisioning rates
against gross loans at 2.5-3 percent (covering
reported NPLs close to three times) for the
largest banks. Also, the fiscal position is
sustainable even under conservative
assumptions about the ultimate fiscal costs of
dealing with a rise in NPLs. Nevertheless, a
substantial rise in NPLs would raise potentially
difficult questions about burden sharing
between banks and different levels of
government. In this context, it is critical to put
in place a crisis management framework that
allows for the orderly exit of weak or failing
financial institutions and clearly defines the
roles of the state in providing fiscal support;
and to adopt a formal deposit insurance
scheme. Moreover, the China Banking
Regulatory Commission (CBRC) should
continue to ensure that banks fully account for
the underlying risks of their loan portfolios
with appropriate classification, provisioning,
and risk weighting.

Off-balance sheet and nonbank

financial intermediation. Financial activity
outside of bank balance sheets has continued
to grow at a rapid pace. This migration of
resources into off-balance sheet activity and
nonbank intermediation risks undermining the
use of traditional monetary aggregates as
policy targets, and potentially adds to
vulnerabilities. While such activity reflects
public demand for financial services and can
benefit financial development in China, there is
a risk that it could weaken monetary control
and threaten financial stability. Addressing this
risk requires the continued upgrading of
regulatory and supervisory capacity. This
includes further improving data collection on
nonbank intermediation and strict oversight of
nonbank risk management, especially in areas
where short-term customer funds are
channeled into longer-term risky investments.
More broadly, these developments underscore
the importance of strengthening the
monitoring of systemic risk and pushing
forward financial reform (in line with FSAP
recommendations), including making
monetary policy more reliant on price-based
signals.

Box 4. FSAP Follow Up: A Preliminary Assessment of Recent Reform Efforts and Pending
Priorities
Last year’s Financial System Stability
Assessment (FSSA) noted significant progress in
moving toward a commercially oriented financial
system, but also identified several near-term risks,
structural challenges, and policy-induced distortions.
The Chinese authorities welcomed the FSSA, and
explained that time was needed to study its
recommendations and decide upon
implementation. They noted that the FSSA’s reform
proposals would be carefully considered as China
continues to develop and safeguard its financial
system under the 12th Five-Year Plan. However,
since the FSAP was completed only last year, the
authorities cautioned that it was still too early for a
full-fledged assessment of the follow-up.
Significant progress has already been achieved in
several areas. Key examples include:
 The widening of the renminbi intraday trading
band in April, which the PBC notes has been
underpinned by sharply reduced foreign exchange
market intervention. If sustained, such restraint
would mark welcome progress toward a more
market-based exchange rate system.
 The PBC’s decision in early June to give banks
more flexibility in setting deposit and lending
rates, which sharply reduced the minimum interest
margin and created scope to enhance monetary
control via prices rather than administrative
guidance.
 A stress-testing exercise conducted in late
2011 that built on earlier work undertaken during
the FSAP. Establishing a regular stress testing cycle
would underpin the authorities’ efforts to ensure
proactive, forward-looking oversight of evolving
banking sector risks.

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

 Improved data collection, including a dedicated
statistical system for bank acceptance bills and a
credit code system gathering data on beneficial
ownership and control for institutional bank account
holders. The CBRC is also enhancing its collection of
offsite surveillance data on leverage ratios and crossborder exposure.
 Launch of an inter-agency mechanism to
develop the corporate bond market, led by the
PBC and incorporating the National Development
and Reform Commission and the China Securities
Regulatory Commission. It aims to improve rules on
issuance, trading, and information disclosure.
 Creation of a task force to help develop a new
risk-based solvency framework for the insurance
sector. The China Insurance Regulatory Commission
has also set up a risk monitoring system for the
insurance industry and clarified the rules governing
exit from the market via portfolio transfers.
 Finalization of an implementation plan for
Basel III, which will introduce higher standards for
capital adequacy to be phased in from January 1,
2013 onward.
Nonetheless, staff recommended further efforts
in other areas, notably to upgrade the prudential
framework to keep pace with the ongoing
liberalization of the financial system. The FSSA
underscored the need to develop a robust crisis
management framework, establish a Financial
Stability Committee to enhance the monitoring of
systemic risk, and to introduce a formal deposit
insurance scheme. The authorities noted some
preparatory work in these areas and recognized that
further efforts are desirable. Concrete progress will
become increasingly important to ensure that the
benefits of financial liberalization are not
undermined by heightened risks to financial stability.

PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA 2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Box 5. Roadmap for Financial Sector Reform
Objective. Move to a more commercially oriented
financial system that fosters stable and inclusive
economic growth, facilitates internal rebalancing,
and safeguards financial stability. The current
system impedes rebalancing as it works as an
implicit tax on household savings that is used to
subsidize corporate investment and protect bank
earnings.
Principles. There is no optimal and predetermined path for financial sector reform, and
plans should remain flexible and tuned to
changing circumstances. Nonetheless, the
complexity and interconnections between
different aspects of the reform process—and the
consequences of mistakes—underscore the
importance of careful sequencing.
Exchange rate. Reaching exchange rate
equilibrium with greater exchange rate flexibility
will simplify monetary management by reducing
the need to sterilize capital inflows and providing
scope for a more independent monetary policy.
Monetary framework. Monetary policy should
move toward price-based means instead of
administrative controls on lending, which will
require the absorption of excess liquidity to steer
interest rates to an appropriate level.
Implementing reserve averaging, targeting a
short-term repo rate, and ensuring the PBC
standing facilities operate immediately would help
strengthen liquidity management and limit the
volatility of money market rates. A new monetary
policy framework could be put in place that
focuses on growth, inflation, and financial
stability.

Regulation and supervision. Improvements in
supervision and regulation, as well as in systemic
risk monitoring and the crisis management
framework need to keep pace with increases in
the commercial orientation and innovation of the
financial system.
Financial market development. Strengthening
nonbank financial intermediation will provide
competitive discipline on banks, offer companies
alternative avenues for finance, and provide
households with a broader range of investment
opportunities. Progress, however, needs to be
calibrated with bank reforms to prevent a
destabilizing rush away from bank-based
intermediation.
Interest rate liberalization. As a strong system
of prudential oversight is put in place, the central
bank can move to liberalize the limits on loan and
deposit rates and allow them to be market
determined. It is critical, however, to ensure that
this liberalization does not result in an unintended
loosening of monetary conditions.
Capital account liberalization. Full
liberalization—especially for short-term flows—
should wait until the bulk of the reforms
identified above are in place. The existing
framework of qualified foreign institutional
investor and qualified domestic institutional
investor could be used to advance a gradual and
controlled opening of the capital account.

Box 6. Renminbi Internationalization

The authorities are facilitating a gradual increase
in the international use of the renminbi. This has
involved allowing the settlement of cross-border
trade in renminbi and the development of renminbi
financial products in offshore markets. This has
resulted in a growing share of trade invoiced in
renminbi, a build-up in renminbi deposits in Hong
Kong SAR, and an increase in issuance of renminbidenominated “dim sum” bonds. More recently, and
as the forward markets in Hong Kong SAR were
pricing in depreciation of the renminbi against the
U.S. dollar, the use of renminbi in Hong Kong SAR
has leveled off as indicated by a flattening in the
share of trade settled in renminbi and a modest dip
of renminbi deposits. Market development has been
helped by a selective relaxation of capital controls to
allow offshore renminbi to flow back to the
Mainland.
The expansion in the international use of the
renminbi has occurred largely in Hong Kong SAR
with its open capital account, highly regarded legal
system, and strong regulatory oversight provided by
the Hong Kong Monetary Authority. A payment
infrastructure has been created, with the Bank of
China as the clearing bank. Measures relaxing capital
controls to support renminbi internationalization
have been progressively implemented:

 Trade settlement in renminbi has been expanded
to all Chinese corporations.
 Rules to remit offshore renminbi back to the
Mainland as FDI have been simplified.
 A scheme has been put in place (renminbiqualified foreign institutional investor) to allow
offshore renminbi to be invested in Mainland
interbank, bond, and stock markets (subject to a
RMB 70 billion quota).
 Mainland banks and corporations have been
allowed to issue “dim sum” bonds in Hong Kong SAR
and repatriate the funds back to the Mainland.
 A renminbi swap facility with Hong Kong SAR
can be used to provide renminbi liquidity offshore.
International use of the renminbi is also being
promoted through bilateral agreements. China
has established renminbi currency swap
arrangements with 18 central banks totaling
$260 billion. The China Development Bank has also
arranged renminbi credit lines with other
development banks and state enterprises in some
emerging markets for renminbi trade settlements.
There are plans to expand the offshore renminbi
business to other financial centers. Most recently,
sales of renminbi financial products have been
conducted in London.

consequently, the current account surplus

PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA 2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Box 7. Analysis of the External Sector
Staff’s assessment is that the renminbi is moderately
undervalued against a broad basket of currencies. As
in the past, this assessment draws on a range of
inputs.

Current account. In addition to the multilateral
model analysis discussed below, the current account
surplus has declined sharply, from 10 percent of GDP
in 2007 to less than 3 percent of GDP in 2011. Staff’s
medium-term forecast has also been revised down
significantly.

Real exchange rate. In addition to the multilateral
model analysis discussed below, the real effective
exchange rate has appreciated by some 30 percent
since the 2005 exchange rate reform, and by 8 percent
over the past year (end-April). The nondeliverable
forward and onshore forward markets have been
pricing in modest depreciation and spot market
pressures are no longer one-sided.

International reserves. The pace of international
reserve accumulation has slowed considerably over
the past 12 months (based on balance of payments
data). It was especially low in the second half of 2011
before rebounding to US$75 billion in the first quarter
of 2012—still below the post-2005 reform quarterly
average of US$100 billion. Nevertheless, reserves are
well above all standard metrics and the real effective
exchange rate should be allowed to continue
appreciating by reducing intervention and making it
two-sided over the medium term.

Capital account. China maintains a broad range of
controls on capital inflows and outflows. Over the
medium term, a carefully planned and sequenced
loosening of capital controls that supports and
reinforces domestic financial liberalization would be
appropriate. It is not clear what effect liberalization
would have on the direction of capital flows.


Net foreign assets. Net foreign assets amount to
30 percent of GDP and have grown rapidly over the
past several years. This reflects the persistent current
account surpluses that peaked at 10 percent of GDP
and years of strong FDI inflows. The composition of
assets is dominated by foreign exchange reserves,
which are around 50 percent of GDP, while liabilities
are largely composed of FDI. International investment
position vulnerabilities are low.
New multilateral methodology. A new
methodology, External Balance Assessment (EBA), is
being piloted. Similar to the CGER,1 it generates
results for three different approaches, but aims to
improve on CGER by more explicitly looking at the
role of policies in contributing to external imbalances.
The EBA also takes into account a much broader set of
factors that may influence the current account or real
effective exchange rate. The analogs to the CGER
external sustainability and effective real exchange rate
approaches, as well as the CGER macro balance
approach, yield a moderate undervaluation. The
analog to the CGER macro balance approach is
expressed in terms of the current account balance.
This approach suggests that China would have a small
current account surplus after controlling for the effects
of the business cycle (both in China and the rest of the
world) and assuming that all countries put in place the
desired policies for the social safety net, fiscal balance,
capital controls, and foreign exchange intervention.2
To achieve that position, the underlying current
account would come down. The results are preliminary
and the model estimates are subject to uncertainty.

Box 8. China’s Rapid Investment, Capacity, and Output Gap
Measuring potential output in China is affected by significant
uncertainty, given the large structural changes in the economy.
Its growth model has relied on very high rates of investment;
combined with surplus labor, this has created sizable and
persistent excess capacity that will take time to close.
China has had a remarkable record of rapid growth and low
inflation, which has helped lift more than 400 million people
out of poverty. Since the last burst of inflation in 1996, real
GDP growth has averaged 10 percent and nonfood inflation
1 percent. The growth model, however, is heavily dependent
on investment, and capital accumulation has explained more
than one-half of the increase in potential output (defined as
the amount the economy could produce without generating
inflation while fully utilizing available capacity and labor). A
potential output estimation method that differs from standard
filtering techniques explicitly models the use of capital and
labor, as well as the relationship between output and
inflation.1

The estimates also show that China has had excess capacity for
most of the past decade. The gap was closing in the run-up to
the financial crisis, but did so based on an unsustainable level
of external demand. Even in 2007, when growth exceeded
14 percent, nonfood inflation was low and stable, suggesting
the economy was still operating below capacity. Then, in 2008,
the government put in place a large investment stimulus that
propped up growth and built out capacity in a range of areas.
Filtering techniques which impose a cycle on the data would
point to a negative output gap since 2007 even while price
pressures were virtually nonexistent and excess capacity was
growing.

Using this methodology suggests that, while GDP growth
dropped to 9.2 percent at the onset of the global financial
crisis, potential output continued to expand at about
10 percent as the government put in place a large stimulus
package that further boosted investment. With investment
increasing by 5 percent of GDP over the past three years, staff
estimates show that capacity utilization has declined from just
under 80 percent before the crisis to around 60 percent today.
This low rate of capacity utilization, together with continued
low core inflation, suggests that there is large excess capacity
in the economy.
Unlike output gap estimates based on standard filtering
techniques such as the Hodrick-Prescott filter, the structural
modeling approach suggests the output gap was around
5 percent below potential at end-2011. However, given
China’s large structural changes, it is hard to pin down the
output gap precisely, and other methodologies typically give
different (smaller) values.

Eliminating China’s excess capacity will take time and cannot
quickly or persistently be achieved with standard demand
management tools without building imbalances. Rather than
aim to do this with short-run stimulus measures, a package of
structural reforms should be put in place to rebalance the
economy away from investment and toward consumption as a
driver of demand growth. This would translate into slower but
higher-quality growth over the medium term.

The methodology is based on a structural model that incorporates information about the level of investment and excess labor supply through
a production function framework. It is estimated using a system of four basic structural equations: an aggregate production function, a Phillips
curve, an equation to estimate the NAIRU, and an Okun’s law relationship relating the unemployment gap to the output gap.

natural gas. A sharp slowdown in China’s
investment growth would also lead to a
decline in financial asset prices abroad, as well
as base metal prices (particularly zinc, nickel,
copper, lead, aluminum, and iron ore), the
prices of agricultural raw materials, and
nonfuel primary commodities in general. This
would result in a deterioration in the terms of
trade for commodity exporters (see Box 3 for
more details). A fuller discussion of these
spillovers is contained in the 2012 Spillover
Report.

The authorities agreed with the need to
rebalance the economy to be based more on
consumption. However, they considered that
the questions of whether China had been
over-investing and whether China’s investment
level was too high remained open to further
in-depth study. This should take into account,
for instance, China’s stage of development,
geographic size, regional disparities,
demographics, and fast urbanization from a
low base. In recent years, capacity utilization

in Germany declines by a slightly smaller amount.
Among commodity exporters, the impact of a
slowdown in investment growth in China is likely to
be largest on mineral ore exporters with relatively
less diversified economic structures and a higher
concentration of exports to China. In response to a
1 percentage point slowdown in investment growth
in China, the estimated effect on Chile’s growth is a
reduction of close to two-fifths of a percentage
point. By contrast, the larger commodity exporters
such as Australia and Brazil with more diversified
economies suffer relatively smaller declines in
growth.

The effect of the spillover from China on trading
partner growth is estimated using a panel of
64 economies exposed to China through the
export channel. The sample covers the period of
China’s membership in the WTO (2002–11) and
includes the full set of OECD economies, emerging
markets classified under the MSCI index, and key
commodity producers.
Economies within China’s supply chain are
increasingly exposed to the risks from a
deceleration in investment in China. Aggregating
across all economies in the sample (weighted by
their PPP shares), the current impact on global
growth of a one percentage point slowdown in
investment in China is just under one-tenth of
a percentage point. The impact is about five times
larger than in 2002. The most heavily exposed
economies are those that lie within the Asian
regional supply chain such as Taiwan Province of
China, Korea, and Malaysia. If investment growth
declines by 1 percentage point in China, GDP growth
in Taiwan Province of China, for example, falls by
slightly over nine-tenths of a percentage point.
Among the advanced economy exporters of capital
goods, Japan suffers a decline of just over one-tenth
of a percentage point in response, while growth

A complementary approach based on FAVAR
shows that the spillover effects from an
investment slowdown in China would register
strongly across a range of macroeconomic, trade
and financial variables among G20 trading
partners, as well as world commodity prices. The
results are broadly similar to those reported in Box 3,
which examines the spillover impacts from China’s
real estate investment slowdown.

Recent achievements. Complementing the existing urban
workers pension insurance scheme, a rural pension pilot was
launched in September 2009 and a pension pilot for urban
residents (for informal workers) in 2011. Since 2010, the urban
workers scheme, in principle, allows workers changing jobs to
transfer both their accumulated individual accounts and
social pooling rights to other jurisdictions.
Key remaining priorities
Broadening coverage. Based on World Bank estimates, around
30 percent of China’s labor force contributes to a pension
scheme in 2008. Among migrants, participation in the urban
system doubled between 2005 and 2010, but remained low at
around one-quarter, compared to 80 percent for local
workers.
Raising replacement rates. According to the World Bank, for
instance, gross replacement rates for the urban old age
insurance system are about 45-55 percent, compared to the
OECD median of over 70 percent in 2008.
Increasing portability. Despite the significant progress in
improving portability, lack of portability of pension rights
across urban pension subsystems or between rural and urban
systems remains an issue. In addition, practical barriers
constrain reliable and timely transfer of pensions even within
provinces, including from incompatible information systems.
Reducing fragmentation, both across space and schemes.
Across space, funds could be pooled at higher levels to
increase efficiency and reduce risks, first at the provincial level
and ultimately at the national level. Across programs,
international best practice suggests integrating the various
urban schemes—including the public sector unit, civil servant,
and urban workers’ schemes—and eventually merging the
rural and urban residents’ schemes.

Healthcare
Targets. The government intends to provide safe, affordable
and effective health care to all citizens by 2020, notably by
raising health insurance coverage, formulating a national
essential drug program, improving basic medical services for
screening and prevention, and reforming the management of
public hospitals.
Recent achievements. According to the OECD, 95 percent of
the population is now covered by basic health insurance and
the private share of health expenditures (including out-ofpocket expenses) has declined to around 35 percent, from
60 percent in 2001. In addition to the urban employee basic
medical insurance scheme, two new ones have been recently
introduced: urban residents scheme targeting nonworkers
and the new rural cooperative scheme.
Key remaining priorities
Curbing out-of-pocket expenses. Benefit levels are still fairly
low and cost-sharing requirements high. For instance, the
rural scheme pays out $50 per person per year and
reimburses 50 percent of the cost of in-patient care.
Increasing coverage of catastrophic diseases. Health benefits
are capped and those covered by insurance are not always
protected against catastrophic health expenditure, leaving
patients uncovered for the worst crises and providing
incentives for pre-cautionary saving. Pilots of enhanced
coverage for some limited catastrophic diseases have begun,
but need to be significantly bolstered.
Reforming public hospitals and pricing. Financing and
managing public hospitals are areas where reforms have
lagged. In addition, their heavy dependence on revenues
from selling medicines fuels inefficient use of hospital services
and contributes to inflated pharmaceutical prices.
Reducing fragmentation. Contributions required and benefits
provided vary significantly between China’s health insurance
schemes. Fragmentation has especially hurt the effective
coverage of migrants. Typically enrolled in the rural scheme,
they can face higher out-of-pocket expense and must claim
in their home county, with much lower reimbursement rates
and long lags.
Financing. More resources will likely be needed over the
medium term to meet China’s social security targets, ensure
the sustainability of the systems, and deal with legacy
pension costs. Currently, public expenditure on health,
pensions, and other forms of social protection only amounts
to 5.7 percent of GDP in China. On average, economies at
similar levels of development spend more than twice as
much.

The deliberate cooling of the real estate

property sector’s important role in the
economy through its significant linkages to
other sectors. Staff spillover analysis suggests
that real estate investment also has a sizeable
impact on the global economy, underscoring
the importance of ensuring healthy
development in this sector. In the event the

1/ Coverage of public sector refers to gross debt of the budgetary general government.
2/ Derived as [(r - p(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; p = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; a =
share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as ae(1+r).
5/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
6/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ Coverage of public sector refers to gross debt of the budgetary general government and contingent liabilities. The latter includes estimated current and future losses related to
NPLs, unfunded pension liabilities, and AMC losses. All outstanding and future contingent liabilities are assumed to be recognized in 2012 (the NPV of this contingent debt is added to
the 2012 debt stock as a one-time adjustment; no additional losses are built into the forecast horizon).
9/ Real depreciation is defined as nominal depreciation (measured by percentage fall in dollar value of local currency) minus domestic inflation (based on GDP deflator).

Data provision has some shortcomings,

but is broadly adequate for surveillance. Most
affected areas are: national accounts and
government finance statistics.

Real Sector Statistics

The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS)

compiles and disseminates annual GDP by activity
in current and constant prices (2005) and
quarterly estimates of GDP. Both the annual
accounts and quarterly accounts are based on the
System of National Accounts, 1993 (1993 SNA).
The techniques for deriving volume measures of
GDP are not sound and need to be improved.

the data collection systems is restricted by the
decentralized nature of the statistical system.
3.

Monthly industrial production, retail sales,

and fixed investment indices are compiled with
the corresponding month of the previous year as
a base period but, no chain-linked time series are
produced. Data revisions tend to be made
without publishing the entire revised series.

cash-based budget data for 2003−2009 following
the GFSM 2001 methodology for publication in
the 2011 GFS Yearbook. However, these data are
limited, with no data provided on government
transactions in expense, assets, and liabilities. The
revenue classification does not fully distinguish
between revenue and grants, tax and nontax
revenue, and current and capital revenue. The
presentation of expenditure by function is largely
aligned with international best practice.
8.

Owing to source data issues, the

authorities have not yet been able to report a
GFSM 2001 Statement of Sources and Uses of
Cash for the budgetary central government
accounts on a subannual basis. As a result, there
are no fiscal data for China on the Principal Global
Indicators website.

Monetary and Financial Statistics
9.

In recent years, improvements have been

made in monetary and financial statistics. The

net foreign assets position of PBC does not
include exchange rate valuation effects and
interest earnings on foreign reserves. The PBC has
also ceased to report separate data on central
government deposits in its balance sheet since
April 2005 because the MOF no longer
distinguishes between central and other
government deposit accounts. This change has
led to breaks in data series of monetary base and
monetary aggregates. The April 2012 monetary
and financial statistics mission established
procedures for regular reporting to the Fund of
data on the central bank and other depository
corporations in the format of standardized report
forms (SRFs) beginning in December 2012.
The FSIs data currently posted on IMF’s website
are available only for core indicators for 2010 and
2011 and no historical data series have been
provided. The April 2012 mission encouraged the
authorities to compile and report the FSI data with
quarterly periodicity. The authorities agreed with
the improved periodicity for their FSI data, but
indicated that they would prefer to move to semi-

an early stage and, furthermore, they are working
on adopting the Basel III at this stage and agreed
to consider the mission’s recommendations after
the developmental work is completed for
collecting data under the Basel III.

External Sector Statistics
10.

The State Administration of Foreign

Exchange (SAFE) relies on an International
Transactions Reporting System (ITRS) which
produces data derived from information on
foreign exchange transactions conducted by
banks. To supplement the ITRS, data on travel
credits and trade credits are collected through
periodic sample surveys, while additional data are
collected from other government agencies and

12.

The authorities continue their efforts to

improve the coverage of direct investment
transactions in the balance of payments and IIP
statistics, and progress is being made in
developing these statistics. Data on transactions
for the nonfinancial sector, received mainly from
the Ministry of Commerce (formerly Ministry of
Foreign Trade and Cooperation), apparently do
not cover all required elements such as
disinvestments. Since ITRS is the major data
source for balance of payments (BOP) statistics, in
order to ensure its smooth operation, regular
training programs for staff in the provincial offices
of SAFE have been recommended. In 2011, China
commenced participation in the Coordinated

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
July 20, 2012
The following information has become available since the issuance of the staff report. It does
not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
Real GDP Growth
(In percent)

1.
Growth. Real GDP growth was 7.6 percent
(year-on-year) in the second quarter. This was
broadly in line with market expectations and slightly
stronger than the staff projection. The seasonally
adjusted data suggest a slight pick-up in momentum.
Staff continues to forecast growth to be 8 percent
this year and 8½ percent next year.

2.
Inflation. Inflation fell to 2.2 percent in
June, a drop of 0.8 percentage points from May. The decline, which was larger than
expected, was due in large part to a reduction in pork prices. Nonfood inflation remained
unchanged from May at 1.4 percent.
Sources: CEIC; WEO; Haver Analytics; and IMF staff calculations.

3.
Trade. The trade surplus widened in June as growth slowed more in imports than
exports. From May to June, import growth fell from 12 to 6 percent, and export growth from
15 to 11 percent. Declining global commodity prices are contributing to slowing import
growth.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation with
People’s Republic of China
On July 20, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with China.1
Background
China’s economy seems to be undergoing a soft landing, though global headwinds are
increasing. GDP growth is expected to moderate to about 8 percent this year and then rise
slightly to 8½ percent in 2013. Since peaking at 6½ percent in July 2011, inflation has been on a
downward path to 2¼ percent in June. Price pressures have eased across all major
components of the CPI basket, led by declining food inflation. Barring further shocks to
agricultural supply, inflation should stay in the 3–3½ percent range this year and fall to
2½-3 percent in 2013.
The authorities’ macroeconomic policies are geared to slowing growth to a more sustainable
pace, and continue to be adjusted in line with evolving conditions. The 2012 fiscal stance aims
to balance the unwinding of past stimulus and supporting the slowing economy. The overall
deficit is expected to be 1¼ percent of GDP, unchanged from last year in cyclically adjusted

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:

terms.2 To help support activity, implementation of approved projects is being accelerated and
some measures to support energy-efficient consumption have been implemented, all of which fit
within the existing budget envelope. The 14 percent M2 growth target is within reach and
consistent with the authorities’ economic objectives. Monetary policy has been eased by the
three cuts in banks’ reserves requirements and the June interest rate reform, which lowered
benchmark interest rates and gave banks more flexibility to set interest rates. The currency has
appreciated, in the year through June, by about 1¾ percent against the U.S. dollar, 7½ percent
in nominal effective terms, and about 8½ percent in real effective terms (in the year through
May). International reserves now stand at US$3.3 trillion.
China’s external imbalances have been reduced significantly. The current account surplus
declined from a peak of 10.1 percent of GDP in 2007 to 2.8 percent of GDP last year, reflecting
primarily a reduction in the trade surplus. The decline in the current account surplus has had
positive spillovers to the global economy. Looking ahead, implementation of the 12th Five-Year
Plan transition toward a more balanced, inclusive, and sustainable growth model will
substantially boost living standards in China and contribute significantly to strong, sustained,
and balanced global growth.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended China for its robust growth that has provided an important lift
to world demand during the global financial crisis. However, they noted that the pace of activity
has slowed and downside risks are significant. Accordingly, Directors agreed that the key
challenge for China’s policymakers in the period ahead will be to achieve a soft landing for the
economy while pushing ahead with reforms for a more balanced and sustainable expansion.
Directors considered the current fiscal stance as appropriate. They welcomed the authorities’
effort to reorient the current budget to support growth, within the overall fiscal target. More
broadly, Directors noted that China is well placed to respond forcefully, if needed, to a
deterioration of the external environment, in particular through fiscal policy. They encouraged
the authorities to direct fiscal reforms toward spurring private consumption, including through
tax reforms and a stronger social safety net. Framing these policies in clear medium-term fiscal
plans would help anchor expectations and ensure that the reform agenda is fiscally sustainable.
Strengthening the finances of local governments should also be a priority in fiscal reform.
Directors considered the current stance of monetary policy to be consistent with the authorities’
economic objectives. They welcomed the steps taken to allow interest rates to be more

transfers to the stabilization fund.

3
market-determined, and encouraged further deployment of market-based policy instruments.
Directors took note of the staff’s assessment that, notwithstanding an appreciation in real
effective terms, the renminbi remains moderately undervalued against a broad basket of
currencies.
Directors welcomed the progress in financial sector reforms, including on the recommendations
of last year’s Financial System Stability Assessment. They stressed, nonetheless, that a large
agenda remains, including strengthening the crisis management framework, adopting a formal
deposit insurance scheme, and promoting the commercial orientation of banks. Directors noted
the risks from rapid growth of bank credit, off-balance-sheet transactions, and nonbank financial
intermediation, and encouraged continued upgrading of regulation, supervision, and monitoring
of systemic risk. Reforms, including capital account liberalization, should be carefully
sequenced in order to safeguard financial stability. Directors also welcomed the authorities’
efforts to cool the real estate market, and noted that eliminating the potential for property
bubbles requires reforms to channel household savings away from housing and toward other
financial assets.
Directors welcomed the decline in China’s external imbalances evidenced, in particular, by the
lower current account surplus. However, this decline has been accompanied by rising domestic
imbalances, reflected in a further rise in China’s already elevated level of investment. While
acknowledging China’s large investment needs, most Directors expressed concerns about the
sustainability of such a high level of investment in the context of weak external demand and
excess capacity. These Directors underscored the urgency of reforms to rebalance the
economy toward more consumption-led growth.
Directors encouraged the authorities to accelerate the transformation of China’s economy as
envisaged under the 12th Five-Year Plan. Directors considered that the agenda should include
further financial sector liberalization, expanding the services sector, strengthening the social
safety net, raising factor prices, and exchange rate flexibility. Together, this reform package will
raise living standards, achieve the desired rebalancing of growth, and distribute its benefits
more widely.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The staff report (use the free Adobe Acrobat

Statement by Mr. Tao Zhang, IMF Executive Director, at the Conclusion of the
2012 Article IV Consultation with People’s Republic of China
July 20, 2012
I thank staff for the constructive discussions held with my authorities. My authorities
appreciated the staff’s candid advice and continue to attach great value to this annual
engagement with the Fund.
Since the global financial crisis, the Chinese economy has maintained strong growth and
provided crucial support to the global recovery. At the same time, the economy is undergoing
structural changes, reflected in part by the substantial decline of the current account surplus,
which has, in turn, contributed to a narrowing of global imbalances. Recent economic data on
the Chinese economy point to a slower but still robust pace of growth, reflecting weaker
external demand as a result of the soft global recovery, as well as my authorities’ efforts to
rebalance the economy toward domestic demand. The pace of growth remains consistent
with my authorities’ target of 7.5 percent for 2012 and the economic fundamentals remain
sound.
My authorities will continue to consolidate the achievements made in transforming the
pattern of economic development and set the stage for further progress under the Twelfth
Five-Year Plan. Efforts are being made to maintain steady and strong growth while
accelerating structural adjustments and managing inflation expectations. However, the
external environment, including a weak global recovery, the heightened stress in the Euro
Area, volatile commodity prices, and rising trade protectionism continue to pose significant
challenges.
Recent economic developments
China’s GDP grew 7.8 percent year-on-year in the first half of 2012. While retail sales
continued to grow at a robust rate of 14.4 percent, the growth of fixed asset investment has
moderated to 20.4 percent, or 5.2 percentage points lower than the same period of 2011.
Growth in property investment has further decelerated to a rate of 16.6 percent. The per
capita disposable income of urban residents and the per capita net income of rural residents
rose in nominal terms by 13.3 percent and 16.1 percent, respectively, with higher growth for
rural residents. Exports and imports grew 9.2 percent and 6.7 percent, respectively, in the
first half of 2012, further narrowing the trade balance as a share of GDP to 1.9 percent.
Inflation continued on its downward trajectory, following the adoption of an appropriate
policy mix. In the first half of 2012, CPI inflation was 3.3 percent year-on-year, or
2.1 percentage points lower than the same period of 2011. The key challenges to maintaining
price stability point to high and volatile commodity prices, rising domestic factor costs, and
frequent shortage of a few categories of agricultural products. As the 2012 Report on the

2
Work of the Government stated, price stability is a key objective of government policies,
which included using monetary policy tools to regulate the supply of money and credit,
increasing production to ensure the supply of major agricultural products, improving the
distribution network, and strengthening the supervision of market operations. My authorities’
projection of CPI inflation for 2012 is around 4 percent, which has taken into account the
aggregate domestic demand as well as the impact of international commodity prices, and the
effect of reforming the regulated prices.
Fiscal policy
My authorities continued to implement a proactive fiscal policy. The 2012 budget projected a
deficit of 800 billion yuan, or 1.5 percent of GDP. Fiscal revenues for the first half of the
year grew 12.2 percent year-on-year to about 6.4 trillion yuan, with tax revenues growing
9.8 percent year-on-year to 5.5 trillion yuan. The deceleration in the growth of fiscal
revenues can be mainly attributed to the weaker economic growth, lower inflation, the
declining profits of enterprises, and tax reduction. Budgetary expenditure totaled 5.39 trillion
yuan in the first half, up 21.3 percent from a year ago. The expenditure structure continued to
give priority to education, culture, medical and health care, employment, social security, lowincome housing projects, while further reducing administrative costs. Outstanding
government debt to GDP is lower than 20 percent, supported by the low level of fiscal deficit
in the past years. This provides the government with ample room for the implementation of
proactive fiscal policy should downside risks materialize.
Monetary policy
My authorities’ monetary policy continued to aim to promote steady and robust economic
development, maintain stable prices, and guard against financial risks. As of end-June 2012,
broad money supply increased by 13.6 percent and credit expansion stood at 15.9 percent, in
line with my authorities’ expectations at the beginning of the year. The People’s Bank of
China (PBC) announced an asymmetric cut in the one-year benchmark lending and deposit
rates, reducing the lending rate by 31 basis points to 6 percent and the deposit rate by
25 basis points to 3 percent, effective from July 6. In addition, the PBC has allowed banks
more flexibility to set interest rates, with the ceiling on deposit rates increased to 110 percent
of the benchmark rate and the floor on lending rates reduced to 70 percent of the benchmark
rate. The adjustment of the band represents an incremental yet significant step in the
direction of further developing a market-oriented interest rate system. The PBC also cut the
reserve requirement ratio three times since last November in response to the liquidity
condition in the banking system and moderating economic growth. The monetary stance will
continue to rein in inflation expectations, enhance the flow of credit to support the real
economy, and strengthen services to boost demand and the development of small enterprises.

Financial sector
My authorities continue to attach great importance to guarding against latent risks which
exist in the banking and public finance sectors. The banking sector remains healthy, with
strong asset quality and capital adequacy. The result of stress tests conducted by the CBRC
(China Banking Regulatory Commission) on 17 large commercial banks confirmed the
banks’ adequate capital position in dealing with macroeconomic shocks and their capacity to
operate under market stress. Risks in off-balance sheet exposures are relatively small and
nonbank financial intermediation is under close surveillance. The Central Government also
strengthened its supervision of local government debts. Local governments are prohibited
from providing guarantees for financing companies. The repayment of the debts and the
provision of additional funding for ongoing projects are being actively but prudently
addressed, while new local government debts are strictly limited. Overall, local government
debts in China are now at a controllable and secure level.
Strengthening domestic demand
The rebalancing toward domestic demand is in progress, in line with the implementation of
the Twelfth Five-Year Plan. The contribution of consumption to GDP growth has increased
to 50.8 percent in 2011 from 43.1 percent in 2010. The expansion of private consumption and
the lowering of the household savings rate is an adjustment process that has to be
accomplished over time. My authorities are committed to accelerate improvements to the
social security system and it is planned that by the end of 2012, there will be full coverage of
the new old-age pension system for rural residents and the old-age pension system for
nonworking urban residents. My authorities will also promote the development and reform of
medical and healthcare services. These improvements will help further boost private
consumption. Meanwhile, progress has been made on the move toward a higher value-added
industrial structure and on promoting regional development. In the first half of 2012, the
value-added of high-technology industry grew 12.3 percent year-on-year, or 1.8 percentage
points higher than the growth rate observed for total industrial value-added; and economic
activity in the central-western and northeastern regions registered faster growth than the
economy as a whole.
Domestic demand in China has maintained a relatively high rate of growth in the past
10 years, but the pace of investment growth has been even faster, leading to an increasing
share of investment in GDP. China’s high investment has to be seen in the context of
ongoing industrialization, urbanization, and technological upgrading in China and the trend is
consistent with some other countries’ experiences, such as Japan and Korea, in their
respective economic takeoff periods. Investment in China is very unlikely to experience a
rapid deceleration, a risk highlighted by the staff as it is well supported by fundamentals, and
there is also adequate room for the implementation of supportive macroeconomic policies.
From a longer-term perspective, the gradual deceleration in the growth of investment in line

4
with the rebalancing of the structure of the Chinese economy would not only benefit the
sustainable development of China but the sustainable development of the global economy.
Measures undertaken by my authorities in the property market are aimed at fostering the
stable development of the market in the longer term. Recent data show that the measures
have resulted in the intended outcome. In the first half of 2012, speculative activity has
dampened and property prices have continued on a path of decelerated growth. Meanwhile,
my authorities would continue to expand the supply of subsidized housing and housing for
low-income families to address the housing needs of families in need. Investment in real
estate moderated to a still-robust 16.6 percent year-on-year in the first half of 2012. My
authorities will seek to prevent large swings in property prices to facilitate stable and
sustainable economic growth.
External sector
China’s current account surplus has declined substantially from 10.1 percent of GDP in 2007
to 2.8 percent of GDP in 2011, reflecting partly cyclical factors but primarily structural
factors, including significant appreciation of the real exchange rate, substantial expansion of
the social safety nets, reform of factor prices, and more stringent environmental standards.
Staff’s past projections of the current account have consistently pointed to a higher current
account surplus than what eventually transpired, and there is a risk that this tendency has
continued in the forthcoming staff report. As China makes further progress toward raising
domestic demand, my authorities view the staff’s projection of China’s current account
surplus at 4-4.5 percent of GDP in the medium term as leaning on the high side. Instead, they
see a high possibility for China’s current account surplus to be roughly maintained at the
current level or to narrow further in the medium term. As the structural adjustment continues,
the change in labor costs, the urbanization process, the demographic structure, and exchange
rate movements are expected to have a lagged effect on resource allocation, subsequently
bringing about a decline in the savings rate and an increase in domestic consumption. Also, it
is expected that the negative impact of the Euro Area crisis will continue to weigh on China’s
exports performance.
Staff’s assessment of the renminbi exchange rate is that it is moderately undervalued against
a broad basket of currencies. This assessment, in my authorities’ view, is not consistent with
the reality. The sharp decline in the current account surplus and the recent two-way
movements in the renminbi suggest that the currency is roughly in equilibrium. Other
indicators, such as the forward rates in the onshore and offshore foreign exchange markets,
also point to a close-to-equilibrium exchange rate.
My authorities widened the trading band of the renminbi against the U.S. dollar in April 2012.
This move further increased the two-way flexibility of the renminbi exchange rate,
facilitating the move of the exchange rate toward its equilibrium. My authorities remain

5
committed to allow market forces to play a larger role in determining movements in the
renminbi, and will continue to reform its exchange rate regime in this direction.
