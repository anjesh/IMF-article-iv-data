STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
Economic outlook: The Canadian economy has expanded at a solid pace since 2013, but
rebalancing of growth away from household consumption and residential investment
remains incomplete, owing mainly to weak business investment. Growth momentum is
expected to continue alongside a strengthening U.S. recovery despite substantially lower oil
prices. Risks to the outlook are modestly tilted to the downside given sluggish global growth,
effects unfolding from sharply lower oil prices, and housing market risks. Key domestic
vulnerabilities in housing markets and the household sector remain elevated but contained
from a financial stability perspective.
Policies for balanced and sustained recovery: An appropriate policy mix should help
facilitate rebalancing to generate a broader and more durable recovery, reduce domestic
vulnerabilities, and further strengthen financial system resilience:
 Macro policies: Monetary policy can remain accommodative for now given that inflation
expectations are well-anchored, stronger business investment is still a missing link, risks to an
export-led recovery are to the downside, and housing markets are expected to cool as U.S.
interest rates rise and with lower oil prices. Fiscal consolidation should proceed in light of
longer-term challenges at the provincial level, but federal authorities should consider
adopting a neutral stance going forward, using available fiscal resources for targeted
measures to support growth. Structural policies to improve productivity in the economy
would increasingly need to complement this policy mix.
 Housing sector and financial sector policies: Further macro-prudential policy action
may be needed to guard against risks to financial stability if household balance sheet
vulnerabilities resume rising. Reforms to limit government exposure to housing markets and
encourage appropriate risk retention by the private sector should continue. Improving
complex coordination across federal and provincial authorities in supervision and stresstesting of depository institutions and strengthening macro-prudential and crisis management
frameworks will reinforce the resilience of Canada’s financial system.
Policy response to past advice: Since the 2013 Article IV Consultation mission, the
authorities have taken some further steps to limit taxpayer exposure to the housing sector
and strengthen mortgage insurance underwriting practices. Some work on FSAP
recommendations has also started to enhance stress testing, address data gaps, and towards
establishing a cooperative capital markets system. The authorities have also intensified their
efforts towards addressing interprovincial trade barriers and export diversification.

RECOVERY CONTINUES BUT REMAINS UNBALANCED
Canada’s recent growth performance has been solid alongside a stronger U.S. recovery. The awaited
pickup in exports is encouraging although it has yet to translate into strong investment and hiring.
Thus, the composition of growth has not yet rebalanced away from private consumption and
residential investment to generate a broader, more durable recovery. Substantially lower crude oil
prices will be a drag on activity, mainly through weaker investment in the energy sector. Risks to the
outlook are modestly tilted to the downside, mainly reflecting external risks including weaker global
growth and still-unfolding effects from the unusually large fall in oil prices. Domestic vulnerabilities in
housing markets and the household sector remain elevated but contained from a financial stability
perspective. Risks of faster-than-expected tightening in financial conditions associated with U.S.
monetary normalization or weaker terms of trade could also interact with domestic risks and
vulnerabilities—mainly, elevated house prices and high indebtedness of Canadian households.
1.
The Canadian economy has been expanding at a solid pace since 2013 (Figure 1).
Growth remained slightly above potential, averaging 2½ percent in the first three quarters of 2014.
Regionally, a multi-speed recovery was led by resource-rich Alberta, while the pickup in activity was
more modest in other large provinces, driven in part by non-energy exports. CPI inflation has been
running over 2 percent since April 2014, up from very low readings in 2013, reflecting largely
temporary factors and the effects of exchange rate pass-through, despite a still-negative output gap
and pressures from retail competition (Figure 2).

Despite the welcome pickup in exports, rebalancing of growth remains incomplete—
owing mainly to weak investment (Chart, Figure 1).

few (including the transportation sector) are performing strongly relative to external demand
growth.1 Energy exports (in volume terms) have also been strong, and Canadian crude oil
continued gaining market share in the United States amid some easing in infrastructure
bottlenecks associated with transporting crude oil to U.S. Midwest to Gulf Coast refineries.2
Weaker-than-expected investment. Business nonresidential investment has slowed in recent years
(following a strong rebound initially after the crisis). The slowdown has been widespread—
including both the energy sector and broader spending on machinery and equipment (Charts).
Companies focused on upgrading or replacing existing capital, in part owing to uncertain future
demand, despite higher corporate profits since mid-2013, resilient domestic consumption, and
strengthening external demand. Moreover, there are indications that lower oil prices will
dampen investment in the energy sector. However, business investment outside the energy
sector could provide some offset, especially in the sectors benefiting most from the U.S.
recovery, and given rising capacity utilization rates.

their spending on housing-related goods and automobiles. Labor markets have been relatively

1

Staff analysis suggests that about one-third of non-energy exports (including passenger cars) outperformed their
model benchmarks over 2009–2013. However, large sectors such as industrial machinery/equipment and
intermediate metal products grew slower and/or remained below their model-predicted levels by end-2013 (Selected
Issues). The analysis suggests that the recent pick-up in non-energy exports is predominantly driven by U.S. business
investment, with some industries (like passenger cars) benefiting also from recent Canadian dollar depreciation.
2

For energy exports, despite declining U.S. oil imports, Canadian crude oil exports to the U.S. continued steadily
rising (reaching about 2.8 million barrels per day on average in January–October 2014 and recording all-time highs in
recent months), reflecting gains in U.S. market share (from 22 percent in 2009 to about 40 percent in 2014).

static until recently. Echoing tentativeness in business investment, the pace of hiring has been
modest with a composition focused on adding temporary capacity (e.g., half of jobs added in
2014 were part-time—a share above its historical average). The unemployment rate had been
hovering around 7 percent since end-2012, before edging down to a post-2008 low in recent
months (about 6½ percent in October-December). The unemployment gap persisted while labor
force participation rate has been largely flat, unlike the declining trend in the United States
(Figure 3).
Housing markets strong with signs of overvaluation to differing degrees. After a brief pause,
Canada’s housing market rebounded in 2014, fueled by low and declining interest rates
(Figure 4). House prices have been rising at 5–6 percent (y/y) nominally through most of 2014
(almost twice the average pace in 2013). Most of the appreciation has been driven by Calgary’s
housing market and single-family homes in Toronto and Vancouver (Charts).3 Since 2001, house
prices have risen significantly—similar to other Commonwealth commodity-exporter countries—
though Canada’s cycle seems to be lagging and relatively smoother. Staff analysis suggests a
national real house price overvaluation (relative to levels justified by long-run fundamentals)
between 7–20 percent, although with significant differences across regions and market
segments.4

Regionally, Calgary and Toronto recorded the fastest price gains followed by Vancouver, while Montreal and
Ottawa registered near zero growth over the last four quarters. Housing starts though appear to have settled down
close to their 2013 average and below 2012 levels. Home sales have not been particularly strong suggesting that
price increases may be due to supply constraints rather than demand factors (Figure 4).

Research by the Bank of Canada staff suggests estimates for overvaluation in Canadian housing markets range from
10–30 percent (Financial System Review, December 2014).

3.
Public finances continued
improving in 2014, reflecting federal and some provincial consolidation efforts (Figure 5). The
general government fiscal deficit is expected to narrow from about 2¾ percent of GDP in 2013 to
1½ percent in 2014, representing a ¾ percent of GDP improvement in structural terms.



The federal government is essentially on track to achieving its balanced budget target in
FY2015/16. This reflects better-than-expected revenue because of stronger-than-projected
growth, one-off measures (including ¼ percent of GDP from an auction of broadband spectrum
license), and lower spending ahead of planned restraint initiatives. Recently introduced income
tax cuts and enhanced child care benefits, as well as lower oil prices that will affect nominal tax
revenues, are not expected to materially delay reaching budgetary balance in FY2015/16.5



Provinces, while remaining committed to their balanced budget targets, continue struggling with
consolidation. Headline and cyclically-adjusted deficits at the provincial level are expected to
improve in 2014 by about ½ percent of GDP (given the outturn in the first three quarters of
2014). Fiscal situations vary across provinces. Ontario and Québec are facing challenges with
consolidation while expecting to return to balanced budget by FY2017/18 and FY2015/16,
respectively (Box 1). Fiscal positions in Western provinces are relatively strong, but a sharp and
persistent drop in the crude oil prices will impact public finances, especially in Alberta, directly
through lower royalties and lower corporate profits and household incomes.6

5

On October 30, 2014, a number of fiscal measures were announced, including (i) the Family Tax Cut, a federal tax
credit (capped at Can$2,000) that will allow a transfer of up to Can$50,000 of taxable income to a spouse in a lower
tax bracket, for couples with children under the age of 18, effective for the 2014 tax year; (ii) increasing the Child Care
Expense Deduction limits effective for the 2015 tax year; (iii) increasing the Universal Child Care Benefit (UCCB) for
children under the age of 6, from Can$100 to Can$160 per month starting from January 1, 2015; and (iv) expanding
the UCCB by introducing a new benefit of Can$60 per month for children aged 6–17 from January 1, 2015, while
repealing the existing Child Tax Credit for children under the age of 18 years. These measures have been
incorporated in the fall budget update, and are estimated to cost about 0.2 percent of GDP per year in FY2014/15
and over the medium term. A further significant decline in oil prices relative to staff’s baseline may keep the fiscal
balance in a slightly negative territory in CY2015.
6

For Alberta, non-renewable resource revenue, mostly from bitumen and crude oil royalties, represents about
20 percent of total provincial revenue.



Gross public debt ratio remains high but should continue declining after 2015. General
government gross debt, as a share of GDP, has risen from 67 percent in 2007 to nearly 90
percent of GDP in 2012–13, but is expected to decline after 2015.

4.
Canada’s external position has improved and is broadly consistent with medium-term
fundamentals and desirable policy settings (Annex I). The trade balance has tended to improve
and the currency has weakened since 2013. Based on staff’s External Balance Assessments (EBA), the
cyclically-adjusted current account (CA) balance in 2014 is estimated at -1.8 percent of GDP,
implying a narrower CA gap of 1.6 percent of GDP according to the latest EBA CA approach (against
3.4 percent CA gap for 2013). Staff assesses the 2014 CA gap to be smaller than the EBA estimate,
ranging between 0 to 1 percent of GDP, closing which would require policy actions aimed at
boosting productivity and addressing energy infrastructure bottlenecks (see below). Reflecting
exchange rate depreciation over the past year (up to end-October 20147), the Canadian dollar is
estimated at 0–5 percent above the level consistent with medium-term fundamentals and desirable
policy settings in 2014 (compared to 5–10 percent REER gap for 2013). In the last two months of
2014, the exchange rate depreciated further by an estimated one percent in real effective terms, less
than what would be implied by its past relationship with real energy prices.8

7

The real effective exchange rate (REER) assessment refers to its average level over January–October 2014.

8

Real energy prices fell by an estimated about 30 percent in November–December 2014. Staff estimates of a longrun equilibrium relationship between the Canadian REER and commodity prices suggest that a one-percent decrease
in the real price of energy would lead to about 0.1 percent real depreciation (see, IMF Country Report 13/41). This is
broadly consistent with the EBA methodology on the relation between real exchange rates and the terms of trade.

Box 1. Fiscal Consolidation Challenges at the Provincial Level: Ontario and Québec
Ontario and Québec—the two largest provinces in Canada—face important fiscal challenges.
Combined, they account for about two-thirds of Canada’s population, near 60 percent of its GDP, and over
half of its exports given a large presence in manufacturing. At the same time, Ontario and Québec are the
most challenged provinces when it comes to their public finances—with Québec having the highest stock of
public debt and Ontario the highest budgetary deficit among all Canadian provinces. This box describes
provincial authorities’ recent efforts to place public finances on a sounder footing and the prospects over
the short and medium term.
Fiscal consequences of the Great Recession
The 2008–09 recession abruptly interrupted healthy debt reduction that started in the mid-1990s.
Loss of fiscal revenues, automatic stabilizers, and higher discretionary spending led to wide budgetary
deficits and higher public debt.

Ontario was hit harder by the global recession with its GDP falling cumulatively between 2007 and
2009, about 5 percent more than Québec’s. A rapid deterioration of the fiscal balance is mainly accounted
by a large discretionary increase in program spending (beyond health care and education) in FY2009/10 and
lower revenues (revenues returned to pre-crisis levels only in FY2011/12). After an initial rapid improvement
in the fiscal position, the progress slowed, and in 2013–14 the deficit is estimated to stand at about
Can$10.5 billion (1½ percent of Ontario’s GDP).

The loss of tax revenues in Québec was milder with revenues reaching pre-crisis levels already in
FY2010/11. Similarly, the increase of program spending was mainly driven by structural factors such as
health care spending (growing at almost 7 percent between FY2007/08 and FY2009/10). In FY2013/14, the
deficit is estimated to stand at Can$1.7 billion (½ percent of Québec’s GDP).

As a consequence, gross-debt-to-GDP ratio increased in these provinces. The bond yield spread
between the two provinces and federal government has widened and remained around 100 basis points,
twice the level before the crisis.

Box 1. Fiscal Consolidation Challenges at the Provincial Level: Ontario and Québec (concluded)
Policy commitments and prospects for balanced budgets 1/
The Ontario government is committed to balancing the budget in FY2017/18. Provincial authorities also
aim to reduce net debt to its pre-recession level of 27 percent of GDP (though without a specific date). After
increasing to Can$11.8 billion in FY2014/15, the deficit is projected to gradually narrow before reaching a
surplus in FY2017/18.2/ Overall, an improved economic outlook and health care cost containment seem
crucial for Ontario to meet its fiscal targets. The burden of the adjustment will be mainly on program
spending which is projected to grow well below CPI inflation.3/ Since the two-year wage freeze for public
servants will have only modest impact on spending, much will depend on the ability to further contain
health care costs.4/ In addition, steps are being taken to improve provincial asset management, including by
considering options to divest non-core assets. Such actions, as identified by the Premier’s Advisory Council
on Government Assets, could yield Can$2–3 billion for potential investments in Ontario’s infrastructure. The
Council’s final recommendations are expected to help inform Ontario’s 2015 budget.
The Québec government is committed to balancing the budget in FY2015/16. Over a longer horizon,
authorities aim to reduce gross debt and accumulated deficits to 45 percent and 17 percent of GDP in
2025–2026, respectively. The return to budget balance, however, has been postponed for the last two years,
and fiscal outturns have consistently disappointed over the last four years. The slippages were related to
lower-than-expected revenues and especially higher-than-expected spending. According to the Fall 2014
budget update, the government has identified about 85 percent measures (from the total of Can$7.3 billion)
needed for FY2015/16 to meet the balanced budget target. Most of the effort is focused on restraining
expenditure growth, by increasing savings from ministries and government organizations, freezing public
service hiring for two years, and reducing tax expenditures and subsidies. In comparison to Ontario,
Québec’s fiscal challenges appear more structural, related to slower potential economic growth, a greater
role of the government, and structurally higher health care spending growth (in part related to demographic
differences despite Québec’s lower health expenditure in per capita terms).

__________________
1/ Ontario’s fiscal framework is legislated in the “Fiscal Transparency and Accountability Act” (2004), which prohibits forecasting
ex ante deficits in each of the 3-year ahead budget planning horizon. Québec’s “Balanced Budget Act” (2009) prohibits ex post
deficits but it has been amended to allow temporary deficits in specific years.
2/ The budget figures are before accounting for the contingency reserve and, thus, represent the most likely scenario. The
government’s objective is, however, expressed with prudence taking into account the use of the contingency reserves.
3/ It is worthwhile noting that in Ontario’s program spending already declined from 18 percent of Ontario’s GDP in FY2009/10 to
almost 16½ percent in FY2013/14. This makes Ontario the province with the lowest program spending per capita.

Growth is expected to become
more balanced going forward, along with a cooling housing market. Spurred by the stronger

7.
A transition to more balanced and sustainable growth is not without risks (Risk
Assessment Matrix, Box 2). Risks to growth are modestly tilted to the downside—led by external
risks that could also interact with domestic risks and vulnerabilities.


Key external risks facing Canada’s economy involve tighter global financial conditions and effects
from substantially weaker oil prices. Moreover, external risks—e.g., tighter-than-expected global
financial conditions or weaker terms of trade on a sustained basis—could further harm domestic
demand by interacting with vulnerabilities in the housing sector and high household
indebtedness. In the energy sector, substantially lower global oil prices, if they persist, and

concerns about still-unresolved prospects for major infrastructure projects would pose risks for
domestic investment and energy production (Box 3).9


Given house price overvaluation, the housing sector is the main domestic risk—alongside high
household debt. A sharper-than-expected correction of house prices would have an adverse
impact on household wealth and access to finance, reducing domestic demand and output, but
risks to financial stability are likely to be limited. It remains, however, unlikely that a sharp house
price correction could take place in the absence of external demand triggers.



Downside risks could occur in unison. A deeper downside scenario would have key external risks
and a housing market correction occurring together.



On the upside, external demand (U.S. investment and housing) may be stronger than expected,
and a faster resolution of infrastructure bottlenecks could support energy exports and
investment.

8.
Both monetary and fiscal policy have space to respond if adverse shocks materialize
or intensify. The federal government and some provinces have fiscal space for automatic stabilizers
to operate fully. A further fiscal loosening for these governments could be considered in the event
of a larger and/or more persistent adverse shock, complemented by greater reform efforts aimed at
improving productivity and addressing energy infrastructure bottlenecks over the medium term.
Monetary policy has room to ease if downside risks materialize or intensify.
9.
Canada is heading towards general elections in 2015. The general election to elect
members to the House of Commons of the Canadian Parliament is tentatively scheduled for
October 19, 2015. At the provincial level, with most elections over, including the 2014 elections in
Ontario and Québec, some policy uncertainty remains especially in Québec relating to potential
fiscal policy changes as a result of (needed) ongoing expenditure and tax system reviews.

Compared to the October 2014 WEO, in the January 2015 WEO baseline, the projected oil prices are about 43
percent lower in 2015 (down from US$100 per barrel to below US$ 57 per barrel) and 30 percent lower over 2015–19.
Projections for partner-country demand growth remain largely unchanged, however, mainly reflecting stronger U.S.
growth.

Potential triggers could include market
displacement from asynchronous policy
normalization (e.g., QE exit, "money shock"). The
impact of this shock (without stronger growth in
the U.S.) on Canadian output would be negative,
and more so if the increase in U.S. interest rates
were to lead to a sharp and persistent increase in
mortgage rates in Canada as well as a faster
decline in house prices than currently in our
baseline scenario.
Medium
This could impact Canada mainly through trade
channels, including through a negative impact on
the terms of trade (as commodity prices would
fall). Domestic demand would also be affected
through negative confidence effects and tighter
financial conditions. However, the weakening of
the Canadian dollar (if energy prices fall) would
soften the impact.

Medium
An abrupt correction in house prices would have
an adverse impact on household wealth and
access to finance, reducing domestic demand
and output. Canada's strong financial regulatory
and supervisory framework, together with a
credible federal system of safety nets, would be
a mitigating factor.

Box 2. Risk Scenarios and Spillovers 1/
Main external risks. Canada can be adversely affected by unexpectedly sharp monetary normalization in
the United States, a more protracted period of slow growth in advanced and emerging market economies,
and a further decline in oil prices.

Sharper U.S. monetary normalization. Monetary conditions could tighten unexpectedly in the
United States and the United Kingdom (with a 100 basis point rise in term premium in 2015), triggered by
market fears over a sooner-than-expected policy rate hike reflecting financial stability concerns (2014
Spillover Report). Even assuming a quick policy response to address market misperception and lowered
short-term interest rates, the output loss for Canada could still be significant in the near term. On the other
hand, if tightening is accompanied by a private domestic demand-driven expansion in the U.S., Canada’s
higher net exports and depreciation against the U.S. dollar are expected to more than offset the negative
impact of financial tightening in Canada due to spillovers. In this case, Canada’s output would rise, or stay
around the baseline after accounting for a likely house price correction (IMF Country Report, No. 14/27,
Annex I).

Slower growth in advanced and emerging economies. A protracted period of slow growth in
advanced and emerging markets could also hurt Canada over the medium term, mainly through weaker U.S.
demand and lower prices for commodities, including oil. The impact on Canada, however, from further
downward pressure on energy prices would be smaller if the additional shock is primarily driven by weaker
demand outside the U.S. (and/or supply factors in oil markets).
Main domestic risk

Housing shock. House price correction can be more abrupt than expected, triggered by, for
example, an overreaction to factors affecting fundamentals, such as an increase in mortgage rates and
deterioration in the terms of trade. Model estimates suggest that a 10 percent decline in house prices could
lead to about 0.1 percent decline in Canada’s private consumption. The rise in interest rates would further
subtract from consumption through higher mortgage debt service, with a 100 basis point increase in interest
rates translating into about 0.3 percent decline in private consumption in one year.
Combined risk scenario. Given interconnections between external and domestic risks, some could
materialize together. A deeper downside scenario would include tighter financial conditions, amplified by a
debt-service channel, a further deterioration in the terms of trade (for example, from an additional 10
percent decline in oil prices), and a

Box 2. Risk Scenarios and Spillovers 1/ (concluded)
Inward spillovers. Canada remains mainly exposed to spillovers from the United States through trade and
financial linkages. Canada’s merchandise exports are predominantly directed to the United States, although
the U.S. share has declined from about 85 percent in 2003 to 75 percent in 2013. Reflecting this tight trade
link, export growth is highly synchronized with the U.S. business cycle and especially with U.S. business
investment (through imports of manufacturing goods).2/ Meanwhile, Canada has become more exposed to
emerging markets over recent years, mainly through commodity prices.3/ On the financial side, Canadian
banks’ consolidated claims on non-residents as of 2014Q2 stood at about 70 percent of GDP, of which twothirds were vis-à-vis the United States. While Canada’s liabilities to foreign banks is relatively small (about
20 percent of GDP) compared to other advanced economies, Canada’s financial and non-financial sectors
could be affected by the materialization of the risk of runs on U.S. mutual funds in the event of an interest
rate shock.
Outward spillovers. External effects on the Caribbean could be substantial given Canadian banks’ dominant
presence in the region and large tourist and remittance flows from Canada. A network analysis based on BIS
banking statistics indicates significant cross-border financial linkages to the region and could be a potential
source of significant spillovers for a number of Caribbean islands where Canadian financial institutions have
a dominant market position. For example, Canadian banks account for about 60 percent of the ECCU’s
banking system assets. Changes in Canada’s economic conditions can also affect the Caribbean islands
through tourism and remittance flows. In 2013, Canadian tourists accounted for about 12 percent of total
arrivals in the region, which is the second after the United States (Caribbean Tourism Organization, 2014).
Remittance inflows from Canada are also sizeable for countries such as Guyana and Jamaica, amounting to
about 3 and 2 percent of their GDP in 2012, respectively.
_____________________

1/ The discussion on assessing macroeconomic implications of shocks has benefited from inputs by Benjamin Hunt, Keiko
Honjo, and Dirk Muir (all RES).
2/ Staff estimates that a one percentage point increase in U.S. business investment growth is associated with ½
percentage point increase in Canada’s real exports of goods and services growth after one year.
3/ Canada is particularly exposed to fluctuations in China’s fixed asset investment given its high commodity-intensity: a
one-percentage point decline in China’s fixed asset investment growth could reduce Canada’s export growth by up to ¼
percentage point (IMF Country Report, No.13/40).

Box 3. Lower Oil Prices: Implications for Canada
Energy sector in Canada
Energy sector plays an important role in Canada’s economy. The sector accounted for almost 10 percent
of GDP (over half of which oil and gas extraction) and over 25 percent of exports in 2013–14. Capital
expenditure in Canada’s oil and gas sector comprises about ¼ of total non-housing private investment,
about equally split between conventional oil/gas and unconventional oil extraction. While the sector’s direct
contribution to GDP and employment has been small, it has notable spillovers to other sectors linked to
unconventional oil extraction activities. Overall, Canada has benefited from the boom in the unconventional
oil production from oil sands (see, IMF Country Reports No. 14/27 and No. 14/28).
Fiscal exposure at the federal level to oil is limited but important for oil-rich provinces, mainly
through royalties. At the general government level, direct revenues from oil amount to about 1½ percent
of total revenue or ½ percent of GDP (over two-thirds of which in Alberta). Corporate income tax from oiland oil-related companies is also an important source of revenue. Other effects would work through indirect
taxes and other revenues affected by the reduction in the tax base (lower nominal growth). To this end, the
Fall 2014 update of the federal budget introduced an adjustment to largely account for the sharp decline in
oil prices, lowering the level of nominal GDP over the medium term.
Implications of persistently lower crude oil prices
A persistent and sizeable decline in oil prices dampens Canada’s growth through a number of
channels. The adverse direct effects would be on investment and employment in the energy sector.
Breakeven prices for Canadian oil sands are believed to be wide ranging from US$50 per barrel to over
US$85 per barrel; more advanced projects would be able to expand even at lower prices, but further
increases in investment would more likely be delayed if low oil prices were to persist.1/ Canadian equity
prices would decline as energy companies represent an important share of the Canadian stock market.
Deteriorating terms of trade, weaker domestic income, and lower financial wealth would negatively affect
private consumption–more so, if the housing market was negatively affected as well. Public consumption in
oil-producing provinces may also be negatively affected (assuming they do not adjust their fiscal balance
targets). Interprovincial trade and labor mobility (which increased alongside the energy boom in Canada’s
western provinces) would also be negatively affected. The historically strong relationship between oil prices
and the Canadian exchange rate would indicate a weaker currency that would help cushion the growth
effects through non-energy exports. Lower energy costs could also benefit consumers and help increase
exports, investment, and employment in non-energy sectors and provinces, especially in the context of a
slightly stronger U.S. growth.
Simulations suggest that typically a 10 percent decline in oil prices, driven largely by supply factors,
reduces Canada’s GDP growth by less than 0.1 percentage point per year, cumulating to about ¼
percent lower level of GDP over the medium term (Chart). The output losses would, however, be noticeably
larger if demand factors increasingly drive lower oil prices. The effects on headline inflation are felt on
impact while the pass-through to core inflation is small. The effects of falling energy prices would in part be
offset by exchange

Canadian oil sands
producers are taking a long-term view of the global oil market but have indicated spending cuts in
the near term in response to the current low crude price environment. Typically, oil sands projects are
based on long-term price expectations and decades-long production profiles. Suncor Energy, the largest
Canadian energy company by market capitalization, plans to cut capital spending by $1 billion in 2015 from
previously planned $7.2–$7.8 billion while keeping average production of 540,000–585,000 barrels of oil
equivalent per day, compared to $7.8 billion capital spending and 565,000–610,000 barrels of oil production
planned for 2014. Canadian Natural Resources, the largest oil and gas producer and the second largest
energy company by market capitalization, plans a somewhat lower production in the short term along with a
large cut in its 2015 capital budget (from $8.6 billion to $6.2 billion). The companies expect major projects
that are already underway for oil sands and heavy oil to move forward as planned but new projects will be
deferred. Over a longer run, pipeline capacity remains the main issue for Canada’s crude oil production.3/
________________________________

1/ According to Alberta’s government, most projects have already committed large amounts of capital and are
increasingly shifting to the production phase. More broadly, investment decisions are also linked to infrastructure issues,
and progress on any major infrastructure projects to export oil would likely help sustain investment.
2/ The price discount between the Canadian oil sands price (WCS) and WTI, which has varied between US$15–20 per
barrel recently, is only in part driven by quality differentials.
3/ While approval or implementation of major pipeline projects continue to face significant resistance, other projects
have become operational in 2014 enhancing pipeline capacity to and from the U.S. refining center in Cushing (such as
Keystone XL’s southern leg, Enbridge’s Flanagan South pipeline, Seaway twinning). In addition, transporting crude oil by
rail remains an important alternative.

POLICIES FOR BALANCED AND SUSTAINED RECOVERY
The authorities should continue pursuing a combination of macroeconomic and structural
policies that would facilitate the rebalancing of growth from consumption and residential
investment towards exports and business investment, further strengthen the resilience of the
financial system, improve the composition of fiscal policy, and boost the economy’s growth
potential. To secure a broader and more durable recovery, maintaining monetary
accommodation along with gradual fiscal consolidation at the general government level would
be conducive for achieving a growth composition with stronger exports and, thereby, investment
in the economy, while targeted macro-prudential policies would help address housing sector
vulnerabilities.

A. Monetary Policy: Gradual Normalization Ahead
10.
Monetary policy remains accommodative given slack in the economy and stable
inflation outlook. The policy rate has been on hold at 1 percent since September 2010. Overall
financial conditions have been easing

Issues).10
11.
Monetary normalization is expected to begin later in 2015. Looking forward, the shortterm neutral rate should eventually rise from current low levels reflecting the normalization in the
U.S. monetary policy and solid economic activity in Canada driven by external factors (mainly, the
U.S. recovery) and domestic factors (pickup in non-energy business investment). In this setting, a
gradual increase in policy rates starting in the second half of 2015 is suggested by staff analysis
toward a medium-term neutral rate estimated to be between 3 and 4 percent over the medium

10

Cyclical conditions (both domestic and external) may make the short-term neutral rate deviate from the longerterm neutral rate. The short-term neutral rate is useful to help assess the appropriateness of the current policy rate as
well as the adjustment path to the neutral rate over the medium term. Specifically, the interest rate gap provides a
measure of policy accommodation (tightness).

CANADA

term. Market expectations of policy tightening more towards the end of 2015 have increased
recently.
12.
Monetary policy can afford to stay accommodative for now. With well-anchored
inflation expectations and downside external risks to growth, the Bank of Canada (BOC) can embark
on policy tightening after firmer signs emerge of a more balanced and durable recovery led by
stronger investment. Also, a negative impact on domestic growth and inflation from the recent
decline in oil prices provides additional room for maintaining monetary accommodation. Moreover,
given the strong co-movement between Canadian and U.S. long-term interest rates, an expected
gradual increase in U.S. rates around mid-2015 along with terms-of-trade deterioration should help
cool down the housing sector.

B. Macro-Prudential Policies: Options for Further Targeted Action
13.
Further macro-prudential policy action may be needed if household balance sheet and
housing market vulnerabilities resume rising. Evolving risks to the financial system and the ability
of macro-prudential tools to influence these developments need to be monitored closely. Measures
introduced over the past few years have been effective in significantly lowering growth of insured
mortgage loans (Chart). At the same time, however, uninsured mortgages—loans with the maximum
loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of 80 percent—which recently comprise more than two-thirds of mortgage
originations have been rising noticeably (on average, 10 percent per year since mid-2010) alongside
house price increases, especially in high-end, single-family housing markets (Chart). With some of
this new lending, particularly by smaller and less regulated financial institutions, going to non-prime
borrowers, it may partly reflect greater use of borrowed funds for larger down payments to avoid
insurance premiums or tighter conditions on insured mortgages.

As an initial step to address evolving risks in mortgage markets, low-LTV mortgage loans to be

CANADA

high-LTV mortgage loans, especially since the largest proportion of uninsured low-LTV loans
have LTVs in the upper range between 75–80 percent and given the fact that down payments
can be borrowed. Data on borrowed down payments would help assess possible avoidance from
tighter mortgage insurance rules.
Additional actions targeted at uninsured mortgages to consider may include tighter
amortization and lower LTV limits for market segments where they remain relatively high and
caps on debt-service-to-income (DSTI) ratios that would also address the issue of borrowed
down payments.11 These measures would also have a particularly dampening effect on the most
overheated regional markets.12



14.
Policies should aim at further limiting exposure of taxpayers to the housing market
and encouraging appropriate risk retention by the private sector, as recommended by the
2013 FSAP. Staff welcomes the tightening mortgage insurance measures implemented by the
Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) over the past year, CMHC’s plans to increase
capital, and a new guideline issued by the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions
(OSFI) to strengthen mortgage insurance underwriting practices.13 The elimination of some CMHC’s
mortgage insurance products will marginally limit the federal government’s exposure to the housing
market since they represent a small proportion of CMCH’s business and can still be insured by
private mortgage insurers.14


In the near term, the authorities will need to implement current plans to prohibit the use of
government-backed insured mortgages in non-CMHC securitization programs and gradually
limit portfolio insurance that will be tied to CMHC securitization. Further reduction of portfolio
insurance for both CMHC and private mortgage insurers and changes to introduce more risksharing should also be considered, which would complement current prudential measures in
cooling off the housing market.



To help encourage market alternatives to insured mortgage related instruments, the 4 percent
threshold on covered bonds’ share in total assets (one of the lowest among Canada’s peers),
could be increased as the issuance of National Housing Act Mortgage-Backed Securities (NHA

11

These measures have been used by many jurisdictions to address risks stemming from housing and mortgage
credit markets. While some countries have used a single instrument to deal with the risks (e.g., India and Indonesia
used LTVs), many other countries have used them in combination (e.g., Israel used amortization periods and LTVs;
Korea, Malaysia, Netherlands used LTVs in combination with DSTI ratios whereas Hong Kong and Singapore used all
three instruments).
12

In past consultations, staff raised the issue of considering differentiated macro-prudential measures across
provinces to target areas with more buoyant housing sectors (see, IMF Country Report 13/40), however such policies
come under the jurisdiction of provincial or municipal authorities (e.g., property taxes and transaction fees).
13

This is broadly in line with recommendations of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision.

The federal government guarantees 100 percent of CMHC’s insured loans and 90 percent of those insured by

MBSs) and Canada Mortgage Bonds (CMBs) is further reduced.15 More broadly, re-examining the
dimensions of extensive government-backed mortgage insurance should remain on the
authorities’ longer-term agenda, including managing a transition from financial market reliance
on government-backed instruments as the public sector role recedes.

Financial stability risks appear contained. Given Canadian banks’ strong capital position and
stable funding sources as well as extensive government-guaranteed mortgage insurance, the
impact on financial stability of a tail risk shock characterized by the worst three-year recession in
the last 35 years would be limited, as reported in stress tests conducted for the 2013 FSAP
Update. The stress test scenario also includes a 50 percent decline in oil prices, in line with
recent market developments, though banks’ exposures to the energy sector and foreign
exchange are small. However, risks from operations abroad where Canadian banks have less
competitive advantage and increasing reliance on capital markets and wealth management that
are more volatile sources of income warrant close attention, including through conducting a
possible cross-sectoral review of banks with exposure to tax haven countries and money
laundering risks.

Risks outside of standard banking activity appear limited. Performance of life insurance
and pension funds has improved noticeably. Life insurance companies have reported higher capital

NHA MBSs are securities that are backed by distinct pools of insured mortgages. The timely payment of NHA MBS
principal and interest is guaranteed by the CMHC backed by the Government of Canada. The CMHC also guarantees
non-amortizing CMBs issued by a special-purpose trust, the Canada Housing Trust (CHT). CHT uses the proceeds of
its bond issuance to finance the purchase of NHA MBSs.

and profits due to insurance sales and wealth management activities. The average defined benefit
pension fund has become fully funded for the first time since 2007 mainly due to strong equity
returns. Financial intermediation in terms of “shadow banking” activity remains relatively limited,
with banks (and other regulated institutions) playing the prominent role in all major segments.16
Overall, Canada’s robust financial regulatory and supervisory framework, together with a credible
system of federal safety nets, adds to financial system strength.
17.
Steady progress has been achieved on key parts of the financial reform agenda since
the last Article IV consultation (Text Table).17 Progress has been made on implementing the Basel
III Liquidity Coverage Ratio and leverage standards. Resolution and recovery frameworks would be
enhanced if the proposed bail-in regime is implemented. The harmonized rules for reporting certain
derivatives data to trade repositories will enhance transparency in the OTC derivatives market, and
help detect possible systemic risks. Staff welcomed OSFI’s draft guideline for derivatives sound
practices which will strengthen the OTC derivatives markets. A new market transaction reporting
system for debt securities, including all repo transactions, will allow the BOC to monitor activity and
potential financial stability risks in the repo market.

16

According to the BOC’s activity-based definition (different from the Financial Stability Board’s entity-based
definition), “shadow-banking” is estimated at 40 percent of GDP and includes government-insured mortgage
securitization, private-label securitization (ABCP and ABS), repos (predominantly in government securities), money
market mutual funds (MMMFs), bankers’ acceptances, and commercial paper (IMF Country Report No. 14/29).
17

Canadian banks have already adopted Basel III capital adequacy standards in 2013. For the 6 designated D-SIBs, a
capital surcharge will also be coming into effect from January 2016. The minimum LCR requirement for Canadian
institutions is set at 100% beginning January 1, 2015, without any phase-in period. While there is a deterioration in
the share of liquid assets to total assets since 2011 (Table 4), the LCR numbers for D-SIBs remain robust and above
the supervisory threshold that came into force on January 1, 2015. Federally regulated deposit-taking institutions will
be expected to have Basel III leverage ratios that exceed three per cent. The capital measure used for the leverage
ratio is the all-in Tier 1 capital of the institution. OSFI will continue to set authorized leverage ratios on an institutionby-institution basis and will update their guideline on liquidity adequacy requirements with Basel III regulations on
Net Stable Funding Ratios based on the final guidance issued by the Basel Committee for Banking Stability.

Resolution and recovery
of D-SIBs

Third generation resolution plans for the D-SIBs are expected to be completed by the end-FY2014, and
the fifth generations of recovery plans are expected to be submitted in 2016. The government has also
concluded public consultations on the proposed bail-in regime. This regime will help ensure bank
shareholders and creditors bear losses (rather than taxpayers) when a bank fails, thereby giving them
stronger incentives to monitor the bank’s risk-taking activities and addressing moral hazard.

OTC derivatives

The largest provincial securities regulators have implemented harmonized rules for reporting certain
derivatives data to trade repositories. OSFI’s draft guideline for derivatives sound practices sets OSFI’s
expectations for central clearing of OTC derivatives and reporting to a trade repository and OSFI’s plans
to establish margin requirements for non-centrally cleared derivatives in the near future. OSFI
implemented credit valuation adjustment (CVA) capital charge for bilateral (not applying to centrallycleared) OTC derivatives in January 2014, which should encourage central clearing of OTC derivatives.

Financial market
infrastructures

The BOC, jointly with largest provincial regulators, published a list of the Canadian-domiciled central
counterparties (CCPs) that can be considered qualifying CCPs under the Basel III capital standards. The
authorities also published draft guidelines on risk management standards for designated financial market
infrastructures. The guidelines will provide clarity on certain aspects of most international standards
related to the risk-management, efficiency and transparency of systemically important FMIs in the
Canadian context.

Repo markets

A new market transaction reporting system for debt securities, including all repo transactions. The
authorities are encouraging some of the largest and most active pension funds in the repo market to
become direct clearing members of the central counterparty.

18.
Progress has been made on some FSAP recommendations (Annex II). Welcome progress
has been made on reducing government exposure to mortgage insurance; the federal authorities’
stress-testing framework for banks; and to identify financial sector data gaps, as well as toward
enhancing the cooperative capital markets system. Moreover, the OSFI has increased contact with
provincial regulators to harmonize regulation and improve supervisory cooperation. The OSFI and
the BOC have also started discussions with some provincial regulators to help the latter enhance
their stress testing capabilities. Addressing financial sector data gaps will improve the BOC’s
research, analyses, and systemic risk monitoring capacity for the financial system. The recent
memorandum of agreement among five provinces and the federal government setting out the
terms and conditions to establish a cooperative capital markets system could prove a useful step in
harmonizing provincial capital markets legislation, enhancing systemic risk monitoring, and
enforcement.
19.
Addressing other key FSAP recommendations would further strengthen the resilience
of the Canadian financial sector. Most FSAP recommendations on financial sector oversight, safety
nets, and macro-prudential framework are outstanding. In particular:


Enhanced supervisory cooperation across federal and provincial authorities and harmonized stresstesting are important to bolster financial system soundness. Subjecting all systemic federally- and
provincially-regulated entities to common stress-testing frameworks would involve a heightened
degree of collaboration. While discussions on supervisory cooperation between federal and

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

23

CANADA

some provincial authorities have started, two-way communication and protocols to share
supervisory information on regulated entities (especially for the financial groups spanning
federal and provincial regulatory boundaries) and planned guidelines should be enhanced within
respective mandates, including to reduce possible regulatory fragmentation and ensure that
supervision remains intensive and effective across all systemic institutions.


Strengthening macro-prudential and crisis management frameworks will increase the resilience of
the financial system. Staff argued that providing a mandate for macro-prudential oversight to a
single entity would strengthen accountability and the capacity and willingness to act, as well as
reinforce Canada’s ability to identify and respond to future crises. Such an entity should have
participation broad enough to allow for a complete and integrated view of systemic risks, and
powers to collect all necessary data for systemic risk analysis. To this end, staff welcomed the
authorities’ recent efforts to identify financial sector data gaps. For crisis preparedness, a
mandate should be given to an entity that could operationalize a coordination framework to
support timely and effective decision-making in a crisis situation and test the capacity of the
authorities (federal and provincial) to respond to crisis scenarios.



Other recommendations include: (i) providing more clarity around the legal independence of the
OSFI, (ii) formalizing banks’ reporting and notification obligations in some areas (such as on the
acquisition and ownership of banks and related-party transactions and large exposures),
(iii) adopting a transparent and consistent regulatory regime for group-wide insurance
supervision, (iv) extending the scope of OSFI’s oversight of the CMHC; and (v) expanding
financial sector data collection and dissemination.

D. Fiscal Policy: Changing Composition of Fiscal Adjustment
20.
Fiscal consolidation should proceed at the general government level. The general
government deficit is expected to gradually narrow from an estimated 1½ percent of GDP in 2014
to near balance over the medium term,

CANADA

pressures, it is critical that the composition of fiscal adjustment shifts more substantially towards the
provinces.18

Federal government
21.
Federal authorities should consider adopting a neutral stance going forward. Given the
strong deficit reduction achieved in recent years (about 2 percent of GDP cumulative improvement
in structural balances in 2011–14), the federal authorities should consider a slower pace of
adjustment after 2014. Adopting a cyclically-neutral stance would imply a small fiscal easing in the
near term but still be consistent with achieving their low public debt objectives by 2021.19 As the
economy gradually approaches potential, this would still allow automatic stabilizers to operate fully
if growth were to weaken should further downside risks materialize. Moreover, in terms of the policy
mix, a neutral fiscal stance would help monetary policy to rebuild policy space further as the
recovery proceeds.
22.
Available fiscal resources could be used for targeted growth-friendly measures. Against
the backdrop of lackluster business investment (despite very low interest rates) and productivity,
such measures could focus on providing further support for R&D, SMEs, venture capital, and
strategic infrastructure projects, with little risk of crowding out private investment. Reducing federal
taxes could provide more space to raise revenue at the provincial level, given that federal and
provincial governments ’co-occupy’ the same tax base.
23.
Fiscal policy at the federal level can benefit from a stronger medium-term anchor. To

19

Relative to current policies, maintaining a cyclically-adjusted primary surplus (at the federal level) broadly constant
at its 2014 level would amount to some 0.3 percent of GDP fiscal impulse over 2015–17, but would still be consistent
with the authorities’ debt reduction target of 25 percent debt-to-GDP ratio by 2021.

Discussions center on a federal balanced budget legislation that will “require balanced budgets during normal
economic times and concrete timelines for returning to balance in the event of an economic crisis.”

CANADA

objectives, while allowing for flexibility in the face of shocks to avoid pro-cyclicality (Selected Issues).
Implications for pro-cyclical fiscal policy vary depending on how the balanced budget rule is defined
(Chart). In addition, key design features for an effective fiscal rules framework would also include a
legal basis to buttress the credibility of the new rules, and well-defined escape clauses to deal with
exceptional events. The Parliamentary Budget Office could play a role in monitoring implementation
of the new rule.

Provincial governments
24.
Fiscal space is much more limited at the provincial level, in light of mixed progress on
consolidation and long-term sustainability challenges. Provincial consolidation plans would need
to proceed, and efforts stepped up, especially in the provinces with the highest levels of public debt
(Québec and Ontario). For the adjustment plans to deliver, in a sustainable manner, a balanced
budget, spending measures may need to be supplemented with additional measures on the revenue
side, especially if the fiscal stance turns more neutral at the federal level.
25.
Progress in containing health care spending should continue to ensure long-term
sustainability of provincial public finances. The growth rate in health care spending has slowed in
the last few years relative to historical trends and it is currently below nominal GDP growth.21 Part of
this slowdown, however, is driven by temporary cost compression though more permanent
structural adjustments are taking place in some provinces. Demographic factors, however, are still
expected to exert a strong upward pressure on costs, and even under optimistic scenarios, health
spending is projected to rise from 8 percent to almost 12 of GDP by 2050.
26.
Fiscal frameworks at the provincial level should also be strengthened. Regular spending
reviews should become an integral part of provincial budgetary frameworks, with a possible role for
independent fiscal agencies. A permanent framework for strategic spending reviews could
particularly support provinces in delivering on their consolidation needs and feed into binding
medium-term ceilings that could be designed to support the implementation of balanced budget
rules currently in place in most provinces. Ontario’s plan last year to establish a budget office
(Financial Accountability Office) was a positive step, and it would be important for the office to
become operational soon. Recent decline in oil prices once again underscores the need for the
energy-abundant provinces, but also at the federal level, to revisit their fiscal frameworks (as was
done in Alberta in 2013) to better manage the volatility associated with commodity prices.
27.
There is scope for improving coordination of fiscal policy between different levels of
government. Long-term challenges to contain aging-related spending call for extending long-term
21

Recent reforms to move away from global budgeting (based on historical levels) toward more patient- or activitybased funding models for hospitals, increasing out-of-hospital care, and consolidating purchases of drugs, medical
supplies, and equipment are helping contain health care costs and increasing efficiency on a sustainable basis, but
further effort would be needed to ensure long-term fiscal sustainability of provincial debt (see, IMF Country Report,
No. 14/27).

26

fiscal forecasts at the provincial level and publishing consolidated general government fiscal
forecasts in consultation with provinces. This would help raise the public awareness of the
challenges ahead and help build the necessary consensus behind the efforts needed to contain
aging-related spending. To this end, a useful step could include a data sharing mechanism for longterm fiscal assumptions and forecasts.

E. Policies to Boost Productive Capacity
28.
Structural measures to improve Canada’s productivity would play an increasingly
important role in boosting growth over the medium term. The authorities’ policies, including in
the context of the G-20 commitments, cover many reform areas, and should be fully implemented.

Infrastructure, trade, and competition.
Enhancing international transportation networks (such as through the planned construction of a
new Windsor-Detroit International Crossing), opening up to international trade (e.g.,
implementation of the Canada-EU trade agreement), addressing energy infrastructure
bottlenecks, and removing barriers to FDI would also be key to boosting Canada’s exports and
growth potential. There is scope to improve competition in network sectors, reduce the barriers
to interprovincial trade and labor mobility (by deregulating professions and skilled trades), and
make the immigration system more responsive to labor market conditions. The challenges of
increasing growth potential appear more pressing in some provinces than others.

AUTHORITIES’ VIEWS
29.
The authorities broadly shared staff’s assessment of the recovery and outlook and the
need for rebalancing. Noting Canada’s relatively better post-crisis performance than other
advanced economies, including in terms of growth, business investment, and job creation, they
emphasized the importance of external demand for the remaining rotation towards exports and
business investment to take place. A weaker Canadian dollar over the past year was seen as helpful
for exports. The moderation in investment growth in recent years was not seen as a surprise by the
authorities given its strong performance earlier in the recovery and the repeated downgrades to

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

27

CANADA

global economic prospects. The authorities noted unused capacity in non-energy export sectors and
uncertainty about the strength of the recovery as potential factors holding back business investment
despite accommodative financial conditions and healthy corporate balance sheets.
30.
The balance of risks was deemed to be on the downside but less so than in previous
years. Staff and the authorities generally agreed on the key sources of risk facing the Canadian
economy. The authorities noted weaker oil prices in the near term, slower growth in advanced and
emerging economies, and a housing market correction in Canada as key risks, but emphasized that
these shocks would be manageable (including through a monetary policy response) if they were to
materialize on their own—provided that the U.S. recovery remained on track. They also noted that a
strong external trigger and much weaker labor markets, however, would be more important than
higher interest rates for domestic housing sector risks to materialize.
31.
A deeper downside scenario with correlated shocks was deemed unlikely at this
juncture. The authorities concurred that the recent fall in oil prices appeared mainly supply driven,
but also reflected weaker oil demand excluding the United States. Thus, risks of lower oil prices and
higher interest rates together could not be ruled out. They maintained that there are a number of
policy options to respond in the event that combined downside risks materialize. These include
further delaying monetary normalization or easing the policy rate. In the event that the policy rate
reached its lower bound, the use of alternative monetary policy instruments such as forward
guidance may be considered. On the fiscal side, the federal government and some provinces have
fiscal room to let automatic stabilizers fully operate.
32.
Given that the fall in oil prices was judged to be largely driven by supply factors and
demand outside the U.S., the impact on Canada’s real GDP is expected to be modest. There
was an overall consensus during the mission that, barring further significant declines in oil prices,
Canada’s oil production would likely be only modestly affected in the near term given large
investments in oil sands already made in recent years, increasing pipeline capacity, and longer-term
views typically adopted by large energy companies. However, the authorities noted the risk that
lower oil prices will have a negative impact on oil and gas sector investment. The fall in crude oil
prices is in part compensated by depreciation in the Canadian exchange rate and a stronger U.S.
economy, benefiting non-energy exports. However, the authorities noted that the impact on
nominal GDP would be significant, through lower export prices and energy-sector profits.
33.
The authorities concurred that there is a need to maintain accommodative monetary
policy. Underlying inflation remains below 2 percent and inflation expectations are well anchored. In
turn, higher long-term interest rates driven by expected U.S. monetary normalization could facilitate
a needed moderation in Canada’s housing sector. Were concerns about household imbalances to
intensify, the Bank of Canada noted that their flexible inflation targeting framework allowed them to
consider using monetary policy as a last line of defense to support financial stability.
34.
A shared view was that housing market imbalances would likely resolve through a
“soft-landing.” Noting the “two-tiered” nature of Canada’s housing market, authorities agreed with
staff’s assessment of mortgage and housing market dynamics. However, they did not see large risks

28

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CANADA

from strong growth of uninsured mortgages which are less risky by nature than insured mortgages
given larger down payments and limited scope of borrowed down payments. OSFI and the Bank of
Canada are monitoring bank credit closely, and authorities are monitoring housing market
vulnerabilities in the insured and uninsured mortgage segments.
35.
Housing finance measures. Recent mortgage insurance changes by CMHC are consistent
with the Government’s long term goal to reduce its exposure to the housing market. Since meeting
with staff, the Government took further steps to reduce its exposure to the housing market. On
December 1, 2014, CMHC notified industry that it is increasing guarantee fees for its securitization
programs, effective April 1, 2015. These changes are being made in support of the Government’s
efforts to enhance the Canadian housing finance framework by encouraging greater reliance on
alternative mortgage funding options in the private market by mortgage lenders.
36.
Authorities noted that reform of government-backed mortgage insurance needs to be
gradual and deliberate. Staff indicated a deductible for mortgage insurance could be an
incremental step to introduce risk-sharing with the private sector and reduce taxpayer exposure.
Authorities indicated that there are significant implications that require thorough assessment when
considering measures to reform the housing finance system, including with respect to a possible
mortgage insurance deductible.
37.
The authorities continue monitoring changes in risk appetite in the banking and life
insurance sectors, including the risks stemming from their operations abroad where they face more
competition.
38.
Existing informal macro-prudential and crisis management frameworks and
supervisory approaches are deemed appropriate and effective in safeguarding stability of the
Canadian financial sector. Based on their evaluation of FSAP recommendations the authorities
noted in particular that they will continue enhancing cooperation with provincial regulators to
coordinate on regulatory and supervisory issues and to strengthen stress testing capacity of
provincial regulators. They acknowledged the risk of regulatory fragmentation but argued that the
current delineation of responsibilities between federal and provincial regulators is appropriate. They
reiterated their view that introducing more formal coordination might undermine the incentives for
provincial regulators to oversee, supervise, and provide a backstop to provincially-regulated
financial institutions. In that context, the Bank of Canada plans to provide provincially-regulated
deposit taking institutions access to its emergency lending facility, provided the institution is
systemically important, has credible recovery and resolution plans, and the respective province has
provided full indemnity to potential losses.
39.
The federal government’s resolve to achieve its balanced budget target in FY2015/16
is firm. The authorities believe that there is scope at the federal level to maintain a neutral stance
going forward, using the available resources for growth-friendly measures. Indeed, the federal
government has already announced tax relief and enhanced benefits for Canadian families.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

29

CANADA

40.
The federal government is committed to introducing balanced budget legislation
given the thrust of the fall 2013 Speech from the Throne. The authorities favor a balanced
budget rule in headline terms that would cover all fiscal aggregates because such a rule is
transparent, simple and easy to communicate and implement.
41.
While fiscal consolidation at the provincial level is mixed and long-term sustainability
challenges remain, progress toward their budget targets was expected. Achieving budget
balance at the overall provincial level over the medium term is considered manageable under
current consolidation plans. The Ontario authorities stressed their commitment to return to budget
balance by FY2017/18 mainly by stabilizing real spending growth. In British Columbia, the authorities
have put in place a new fiscal regime for the LNG sector to make the province internationally
competitive for new LNG investments and enhance fiscal revenues.
42.
There are a number of policy initiatives underway which should help boost Canada’s
potential growth and productivity but challenges remain. For example, the authorities have
stepped up the efforts to address barriers to interprovincial trade and promote export
diversification, including by signing a free trade agreement with Korea and a reciprocal currency
agreement with China. As well, the government is implementing its ten-year New Building Canada
Plan focusing on broadband networks, public transportation, and support for innovation. There are,
however, some structural issues which could help explain Canada’s persistent productivity gap with
the United States. For example, investment in Information Communication Technology per worker in
Canada is half that in the United States, with ¾ of the gap explained by investment in software, and
most of the gap coming from the financial sector, professional services, and the telecommunication
sector.

STAFF APPRAISAL
43.
Canada’s economy experienced solid growth over the past year but rebalancing
toward exports and investment remains incomplete. Exports are benefiting from the firming U.S.
recovery but have not yet translated into a meaningful pick-up in business investment, as firms
remained cautious about the demand outlook. Substantially lower oil prices will likely be a drag on
growth mainly through weaker investment in the energy sector. Higher household wealth, rising
disposable incomes, and relaxed financial conditions have continued supporting relatively strong
private consumption. Housing has regained momentum but with important differences across
regions and markets.
44.
Solid growth is envisaged to continue while becoming more balanced. Stronger nonenergy exports and business investment, spurred by the U.S. recovery, should sustain Canada’s
growth above potential in the near term. Rising long-term interest rates and weaker terms-of-trade
mostly due to significantly lower oil prices would moderate private consumption and residential
investment, with an expected ‘soft-landing’ in housing markets. Core inflation is expected to remain
close to the Bank of Canada’s target rate of 2 percent as the remaining slack in the economy is
gradually reabsorbed and inflation expectations remain well anchored.

30

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CANADA

45.
Balance of risks is modestly tilted to the downside for the Canadian economy. A fasterthan-expected tightening of global financial conditions, effects from substantially lower crude oil
prices, and sluggish global growth are the key downside risks facing Canada. While continued U.S.
growth and a depreciating Canadian dollar would help dampen the adverse impact of these shocks,
the net outcome for Canada can be negative. Deeper downside risks to growth involve a
combination of external shocks that are amplified by high household balance sheet vulnerabilities
and a sharper-than-expected correction in house prices. On the upside, U.S. demand may be
stronger than expected, and a faster resolution of infrastructure bottlenecks could support activity in
the energy sector.
46.
Lower crude oil prices present a challenge but also an opportunity. Canada has
benefited from the boom in oil sands production despite intensified challenges to competitiveness
in non-energy sectors. Substantially lower oil prices would likely cool activity in oil-rich provinces, an
engine of Canada’s growth in recent years, but benefit provinces reliant on manufacturing and
services. The Canadian economy’s ability to deliver productivity gains in non-energy sectors will be
increasingly important.
47.
Monetary policy can afford to stay accommodative for now. Given well-anchored
inflation expectations and downside risks to export-driven growth, a monetary policy tightening
cycle can await firmer signs to emerge of a more balanced and durable recovery with stronger
business investment in non-energy sectors. Further macro-prudential policy action may be needed if
household balance sheet and housing market vulnerabilities resume rising, such as tighter standards
for uninsured mortgages.
48.
Action to further limit exposure of taxpayers to the housing market and encourage
appropriate risk retention by the private sector would be desirable. These would include
changes to collateral used in securitization, tightening portfolio insurance limits, and changes to
mortgage insurance products to introduce more risk-sharing. Any structural change to mortgage
insurance and the transition to a different regime would need to proceed gradually to avoid any
unintended consequences on financial stability.
49.
Financial sector performance remains strong. Canadian banks’ performance has
improved, and stress tests suggest that banks are resilient to credit, liquidity, and contagion risks
arising from a tail risk scenario. However, it is essential to remain vigilant against the potential risks
from housing and banks’ increasing exposure to capital markets and foreign operations.
Performance of life insurance and pension funds, meanwhile, has improved noticeably.
50.
The international financial reform agenda has advanced, and some work on FSAP
recommendations has started though key steps are still needed. Basel III Liquidity Coverage
Ratio and leverage standards have been implemented and will take effect in January 2015, and
banks are well positioned to meet the new requirements. Staff welcomes OSFI’s draft guideline for
Derivatives Sound Practices and progress made on the federal authorities’ stress-testing framework,
as well as the recent steps taken toward establishing a cooperative capital markets system. However,

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

31

CANADA

outstanding FSAP recommendations on financial sector oversight, safety nets, and macro-prudential
frameworks remain to be addressed.
51.
Fiscal consolidation should proceed at the general government level, but the federal
government should consider adopting a neutral stance going forward. With key fiscal
challenges concentrated at the provincial level, particularly from aging-related spending pressures, it
is critical that the composition of fiscal adjustment shifts from the federal government towards the
provinces.
52.
Strengthening medium-term fiscal frameworks would support sound public finances
at different levels of government. If the federal authorities were to introduce balanced budget
legislation, the new rules-based framework should be transparent, easy-to-communicate, and
ensure convergence towards the authorities’ medium-term objectives, while allowing for sufficient
flexibility in the face of shocks to avoid pro-cyclicality. Long-term challenges to contain agingrelated spending call for extending long-term fiscal forecasts at the provincial level and publishing
consolidated general government fiscal forecasts in consultation with provinces.
53.
Further advancing structural policies is increasingly important to address lagging
productivity. The authorities’ policies, including in the context of G-20 commitments, cover many
reform areas. Reform efforts to increase productivity in non-energy sectors should continue—
focusing on improving skills-job matching, promoting penetration of information and
communication technologies, and fostering business investment in R&D. Enhancing interprovincial
and international trade, including through implementation of major trade agreements, improving
competition in network sectors, and addressing infrastructure constraints in energy exports would
also play a key role in boosting Canada’s growth over the medium term.
54.
It is expected that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard
12-month cycle.

Annex I. Canada: External Sector Assessment Report
Canada
Foreign asset
and liability
position and
trajectory

Background. After hovering at about -15 percent of GDP in 2009–12, Canada’s net international investment position
(NIIP) turned slightly positive by end-2013 (1½ percent of GDP) and stood at 1 percent of GDP in 2014Q3, as foreign
equity markets outperformed the domestic market and the currency weakened. Canada has a positive net equity position
and a negative net debt position, reflecting sizable FDI and portfolio equity investment overseas. Gross external assets
and liabilities are each around 160 percent of GDP. The NIIP is projected to remain largely unchanged amid projected
decline in current account deficits.
Assessment. Gross external debt, at about 80 percent of GDP (2014Q3), is low relative to other advanced economies, and
is a modest vulnerability.

Current
account

Background. Canada’s current account (CA) shifted from a surplus of 2½ percent of GDP in 2000 to a deficit of
3.0 percent of GDP in 2013 and is projected at 2.1 percent of GDP in 2014. The deterioration reflects Canada’s stronger
rebound from the last recession relative to the United States, but also the significant real appreciation of the Canadian
dollar and weak productivity growth. At the same time, limited refining capacity and lack of transportation infrastructure
curbed the positive impact on the current account from the boom in unconventional energy production. In terms of the
savings-investment (S-I) balance, the current account deterioration largely matches the worsening of the general
government S-I balance, while the private S-I balance is back to its slightly negative pre-recession levels.
Assessment. The EBA CA regression approach estimates a CA gap of 1.6 percent of GDP for 2014 (down from
3.4 percent of GDP for 2013). This, however, likely overstates the desirable external adjustment, including because it
underestimates the cyclical nature of the current account deficit (given Canada’s smaller output gap relative to the
United States and the lower market price for Canadian oil relative to global oil prices).1/ Staff assesses that the 2014
cyclically-adjusted current account is between 0 to 1 percentage points of GDP weaker than the value implied by
medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies.
Background. Canada’s exchange rate is correlated with oil prices, and the real effective exchange rate (REER) appreciated
by 30 percent between 2000 and 2010 as energy prices surged. In recent years, the interest rate differential with the
United States and safe-haven capital inflows have become increasingly important for Canada’s exchange rate
movements. Reflecting rising market U.S. interest rates, weaker capital inflows, and flatter energy prices, Canada’s REER
depreciated by about 10 percent since end-2012.
Assessment. The EBA REER regression approach estimates a REER gap of 3 percent for the 2014 average REER level
(against 10 percent for 2013).2/ Translating staff’s assessment of the CA gap suggests an average 2014 REER
overvaluation of between 0 and 5 percent relative to medium-term fundamentals and desirable policy settings (down
from the estimated range of 5–10 percent overvaluation reported in the July 2014 Pilot External Sector Report).

Overall assessment:
The external position is broadly consistent
with medium-term fundamentals and
desirable policy settings.
Non-energy export performance has been
disappointing in recent years, and while the
depreciation of the Canadian dollar is likely
to help, boosting Canada’s exports would
require addressing the productivity gap
with trading partners and energy export
constraints. The general government
(especially, provincial) fiscal position has
deteriorated after the Great Recession, and
the ongoing fiscal consolidation would
contribute to improving the national
saving-investment balance.
Potential policy responses: Policies that
could help gradually bring Canada’s current
account closer to the level implied by
fundamentals include measures to improve
labor productivity (such as budget
programs aimed at improving labor skills
and job matching, and fostering research
and innovation); to promote investments in
infrastructure to transport and export
natural resources; and to further facilitate
inter-provincial and international trade; as
well as policies to restore stronger fiscal
position (through the planned and
sustained fiscal adjustment at the provincial
level).

Capital and
financial
accounts:
flows and
policy
measures

Background. The CA deficit of recent years has been financed primarily by net portfolio inflows. Average net portfolio
outflows from 2000–07 turned into inflows of some 4 percent of GDP as relatively strong growth prospects, sound fiscal
position, and high interest rates made Canada a safe-haven and carry trade destination, putting upward pressure on the
exchange rate (along with high commodity prices).

FX
intervention
and reserves
level

Background. Canada has a free floating exchange rate regime, and the central bank has not intervened in the foreign
exchange market since September 1998 (with the exception of participating in concerted intervention for other
purposes). The Government of Canada has moderate reserves and the Bank of Canada has standing U.S. dollar and
foreign currency liquidity swap arrangements with the Federal Reserve and four other major central banks (it has not
drawn on these swap lines in the past).

Assessment. Canada has a fully open capital account. Vulnerabilities are limited by a credible commitment to a floating
exchange rate and a strong fiscal position.

Assessment. Policies in this area are appropriate to the circumstances of Canada.
Technical
Background
Notes

1/ First, the EBA may overestimate the CA norm for Canada as the adjustment for the business cycle is done using
Canada’s output gap relative to the world (GDP-weighted average) output gap, while a more relevant measure for Canada
is the gap relative to the United States. As the latter is currently larger, EBA likely underestimates Canada’s CA
improvement as the U.S. output returns to potential. Second, the oil trade balance and the terms of trade variables are
both likely to be biased upward for Canada, as the EBA uses the WEO global oil prices rather than the lower market price
for Canadian oil, particularly, heavy crude oil from western Canada’s oil sands (the lower price reflects lower quality,
transportation costs, and more recently also the impact of limited pipeline and refinery capacity). To the extent the
difference is due to infrastructure bottlenecks, adding transportation capacity over the medium term should help close the
CA gap.
2/ Staff’s REER assessment refers to the average January–October 2014 level and assumes unchanged REER at that level for
the rest of the year. Canada’s REER depreciated by an estimated one percent in November–December 2014.

Annex II. Canada: Key FSAP Recommendations and
Implementation
Recommendation

Expand financial sector data collection and dissemination
with a view to enhancing coverage, regularity, and
availability of time-series to facilitate analysis.

Reduce the government’s exposure to mortgage insurance
gradually.

Augment OSFI’s top-down stress testing framework for
banks with risk-sensitive concepts of key credit risk input
parameters and econometric, model-based approaches
using longer time series.

Implementation Time frame

Assessment of progress

Short term

• CMHC have established an internal “data gaps”
working group to address data gaps related to housing
markets, housing finance, social housing, as well as
gaps related to research; unveiled the Housing Market
Information Portal, which allows for easy access to
housing market data; published some new data on
condominium ownership in Toronto and Vancouver.
• CMHC started publishing a supplement to its
Quarterly Financial Reports that enables greater
transparency and clarity with respect to its insurance
underwriting practices.
• CMHC plans to add further information and
functionality to the Portal, introduce a new tool that
examines a number of risk factors of problematic
house price conditions (Housing Price Analysis and
Assessment framework or HPAA) and possibly publish
its stress testing results
• OSFI has implemented a new data system that allows
for easier extraction of time series data from the
regulatory returns.

Long term

• CMHC mortgage loan insurance for the financing of
multi-unit condominium construction discontinued in
June 2014.
• CMHC aligned its low ratio insurance with its high
ratio product by establishing maximum house prices,
amortization periods, and debt servicing ratios
(effective July 31, 2014).
• CMHC discontinued its Second Home and SelfEmployed Without 3rd Party Income Validation
mortgage insurance products (effective May 30, 2014).
• CMHC increased its mortgage loan insurance
premiums for homeowner and 1 – 4 unit rental
properties (effective May 1, 2014) by approximately
15%, on average, for all loan-to-value ranges.
• CMHC implemented changes to its portfolio
insurance product (effective January 1, 2014).
• CMHCs mortgage loan insurance business became
subject to a risk fee payable to the Government of
Canada of 3.25% of premiums written and an
additional 10 basis points on new portfolio insurance
written (effective January 1, 2014).
• For 2014, the Minister of Finance authorized CMHC to
provide up to Can$80 billion of new guarantees of
NHA MBS and up to Can$40 billion of new guarantees
for CMB.
• For 2014, CMHC reduced its annual issuance of
portfolio insurance from Can$11 billion to Can$9
billion.

Short term

• OSFI has started to augment its stress testing
framework with econometric models that are used for
projections based on longer time series.

Recommendation

Implementation Time frame

Assessment of progress

Include major regulated entities at federal and provincial
level in a regular, common stress testing exercise, which
would involve a degree of collaboration between relevant
federal and provincial authorities.

Short term

• OSFI and the BOC have begun discussions with some
provincial regulators to help them enhance their stress
testing capabilities, including by providing detailed
scenarios used in stress testing of D-SIBs and possible
technical assistance going forward.

Equip OSFI with powers to make its own enforceable rules
by administrative means, supplementing the use of
guidelines and government regulations; amend legislation
on statutory decisions to give OSFI sole decision- making
authority on prudential criteria.

Medium term

• No progress.

Replace certain informal and ad hoc reporting
requirements by FRFIs with more formal requirements.

Medium term

• OSFI is currently assessing which reporting
requirements should be formalized.

Adopt a transparent and consistent regulatory regime for
group-wide insurance supervision; give OSFI the authority
to take supervisory measures at the level of the holding
company.

Medium term

• No progress.

Address shortcomings in risk identification and
enforcement in securities regulation.

Enhance supervisory cooperation among federal and
provincial supervisors and subject all systemically
significant financial institutions to intensive supervision.

Provide a clear mandate to an entity (i) to monitor
systemic risk to facilitate macro-prudential oversight, and
(ii) to carry out system-wide crisis preparedness.

Increase the ex-ante funding of CDIC and enhance its data
collection and analysis of depositor profiles.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Short term

• The provincial Ministers responsible for securities
regulation in British Columbia, Ontario, Saskatchewan,
New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island, and the
Minister of Finance Canada signed a memorandum of
agreement setting out the terms and conditions to
establish a Cooperative Capital Markets Regulatory
System.
• Consultation drafts of uniform provincial capital
markets legislation and complementary federal
legislation were released for public comment (in
September 2014).

Short term

• OSFI has increased contact with provincial regulators
with an aim to harmonize regulation and improve
supervisory cooperation. The current discussions are
focused on delineating the key touch points between
federal and provincial regulators.

Short term

• Work has begun to address financial sector data gaps
that will improve the BOC’s research, analysis, and
systemic risk monitoring capacity for the financial
system. While the initial step of identifying data gaps is
completed, next steps include determining the best
options for closing the key data gap based on priorities
and feasibility analysis, concrete steps in collecting and
obtaining the data, and agreeing upon which agency
would take the lead in the implementation phase.
• The new systemic risk assessment committee chaired
by the BoC (a sub-committee of the non-statutory
Senior Advisory Committee) was set up, but the
responsibility for systemic risk remains with the SAC.

Medium term

• The government has announced a review of the
deposit insurance framework that will consider the size
of the ex-ante fund of the Canada Deposit Insurance
Corporation (CDIC), among other issues.

Annex III. Canada: Public Debt Sustainability Analysis
Canada’s general government gross debt peaked at about 88 percent of GDP in 2012 and is expected
to decline over the medium term under staff’s baseline scenario. Government financial assets are
sizeable in Canada and represent about 50 percent of GDP, of which about 20 percent are highlyliquid assets, which put the net debt-to-GDP ratio at below 40 percent of GDP in 2013. Gross financing
needs are relatively large, but are expected to be below 15 percent of GDP after 2016. The general
government debt position is relatively resilient to a series of macro and fiscal shocks in the medium
term.

Primary balance shock. A scenario
involving a deterioration of the structural
primary balance of about 1 percent of GDP
raises the gross debt-to-GDP ratio by
about 3 percentage points over the
projection period. The risk premium on
sovereigns is assumed to increase by
25 basis points (bps) for each 1 percent of
GDP deterioration in primary balance, with
little effects on the debt path.

Growth shock. A lower real output growth by 1 standard deviation for 2 years starting in 2015
would have a significant impact on the level of gross debt, which will reach 91½ percent of GDP
in 2016, but would revert to a downward path over the projection period.



Interest rate shock. An increase in sovereign risk premia by 200 bps for two years would raise the
government’s interest bill by about ½ percent by 2016 (about 95 percent of outstanding
marketable debt is in fixed coupon bonds). Higher borrowing costs would slow the decrease in
the debt-to-GDP ratio, which ends up 1½ percentage points higher than in the baseline in 2019,
at about 81½ percent.



Exchange rate shock. If the exchange rate depreciates by about 15 percent, the fiscal impact is
minimal—almost 90 percent of Canada’s outstanding marketable debt instruments are in
Canadian dollar, and both federal and sub-national governments usually hedge their FX
exposures.



Commodity price shock. Lower than expected commodity prices, by 10 percent on average over
the forecasting horizon would increase the gross debt to 91 percent of GDP in 2016 and decline
to 85 percent by 2019.

The sizable general government liquid financial assets represent a mitigating factor for

In addition, Canada’s gross and net public debt have increased in recent years due to
Canadian government policy to fund public sector employee pension plans by raising market
debt. Unfunded pension liabilities of the public sector are excluded here from Canada’s general
government debt, to improve consistency with other countries that do not report these liabilities.
However, because Canada has funded part of its pension liabilities since 2000, those liabilities are
reflected in its public debt.

the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions. Canada maintains
exchange restrictions for security reasons, based on UN Security Council Resolutions, that have been
notified to the Fund for approval (most recently in June 10, 2014) under the procedures set forth in
Executive Board Decision No. 144–(52/51).
Last Article IV Consultation: The Staff Report for the 2013 consultation with Canada was
considered by the Executive Board on January 29, 2014 (IMF Country Report No. 14/27). Canada is
on a 12-month consultation cycle.
The 2014 Article IV discussions took place in Montreal, Toronto, Victoria, Vancouver, and Ottawa
during November 10–25, 2014. The team comprised Hamid Faruqee (head), Lusine Lusinyan, Andrea
Pescatori, Rania Papageorgiou (all WHD), Minsuk Kim (SPR), Tidiane Kinda (FAD), and Ivo Krznar
(MCM). Messrs. Werner and Srinivasan (both WHD) joined the mission for concluding meetings in
Ottawa. Mr. Parent (OED) accompanied the mission, and Mr. Dupont (OED) attended the concluding
meetings. The mission met with Finance Minister Oliver, Deputy Finance Minister Rochon, Bank of
Canada Senior Deputy Governor Wilkins, other senior officials, and provincial government
representatives. A press conference was held on November 26 in Ottawa. Outreach activities
included discussions with finance industry, academic, business sector, trade union representatives,
and think tanks.
FSSA Participation and ROSC Assessments
Canada–Financial System Stability Assessment–
Volume II: Report on Observance of Standards in
the Financial System

www.imf.org
June 30, 2000

Summary: The FSSA report concluded that Canada has a stable and highly advanced
financial system, which is among the soundest in the world. It is supported by a welldeveloped regulatory system that shows a high degree of compliance with major
international standards. The FSSA report made a few recommendations to further
strengthen the regulatory framework and financial system’s resilience, most of which
have already been addressed, including:


Introducing capital requirements for the guarantees in life insurance segregated
fund (completed by end-2001);



Tabling legislation granting the Office of the Superintendent of Financial
Institutions (OSFI) powers to remove a financial institution’s director or senior
officer if the person is deemed not suitable to hold that office based on a number
of criteria. The latter legislation brought Canada into broad compliance with the
Basel Core Principles;



Making significant progress in harmonizing securities regulation and improving
coordination among provincial securities regulators, including through a newly
created association of securities regulators, the Canadian Securities
Administrators. Although there remain multiple regulators at the provincial level,

a Senate commission was created to develop specific recommendations on
further harmonization and streamlining of securities regulation.
Canada: Report on the Observance of Standards
and Codes—Fiscal Transparency Module

IMF Country Report
No. 02/51, 03/12/02

Summary: The report found that fiscal management in Canada meets the requirements
of the fiscal transparency code, and in a number of instances represents best practice. In
particular, it highlighted the use of private sector economic forecasts. Fiscal management
was also commended for its statistical integrity, impartial tax administration, open
procurement, and a transparent regulatory process.
The report found several areas where further improvements would be desirable,
including: (i) the preparation of timely, current year estimates of federal and provincial
budgets on a comparable basis, (ii) a comprehensive account of the procedures for the
budget cycle and expenditure management system, (iii) systematic reporting of the use
of reserves for non-economic contingencies, (iv) resumption of publication of reconciled
national and public accounts forecasts of major aggregates over the forecast horizon,
and (v) publication by all governments of quasi-fiscal activities.
Many of these issues have been addressed, including: (i) the release by Statistics Canada
of consolidated data for federal and provincial budgets for 2001–02 (on a Financial
Management System basis); (ii) the publication of comprehensive descriptions of budget
and expenditure management procedures, including a joint document entitled
“Budgeting in Canada” by the Government and the OECD, detailed accounts of policies
and procedures on expenditure management at the website of the Treasury Board
Secretariat, and the explanation of the budget cycle and process in Budget and Update
documents; and (iii) publication of reconciled national and public accounts forecasting.
Canada: Report on the Observance of Standards
and Codes—Data Module

IMF Country Report
No. 03/328, 10/23/03

Summary: Canada’s macroeconomic statistics are comprehensive, timely, and accurate
and thus adequate to conduct effective surveillance of economic and financial policies.
Official institutions responsible for the compilation and dissemination of the
macroeconomic datasets are supported by adequate legal and institutional frameworks.
These frameworks protect confidentiality and ensure that statistical work is conducted
within a quality assurance program and with sufficient resources. Integrity is ensured by
the professionalism of the staff, transparency in statistical policies and practices, and the
provision of ethical guidelines for staff. Compilers generally follow internationally
accepted guidelines in the production of the macroeconomic statistics, which is wellsupported by excellent efforts to develop source data that facilitate a high degree of
accuracy and reliability. Statistics are generally relevant, well documented, available with
good frequency on a timely basis, and readily accessible to users, who trust them as
objective.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CANADA

While recognizing the high quality of the macroeconomic data, the report makes
recommendations to further strengthen the statistical system, most of which are already
being addressed, including these priorities:


Articulate the roles of Statistics Canada and the Bank of Canada in producing
financial sector statistics and explore possibilities for more data sharing of monetary
and financial statistics;



Estimate consumption of fixed capital at replacement cost rather than historic costs
now used for the corporate sector in the Canadian System of National Accounts
(CSNA);



Disseminate information on the sources and methods used in compiling quarterly
public sector statistics for the quarterly CSNA; and



Reclassify certain transactions that are not recorded in line with the 5th edition of the
Balance of Payments Manual (BPM5).

Canada: Report on the Observance of Standards
and Codes––FATF Recommendations for AntiMoney Laundering and Combating the Financing
of Terrorism

IMF Country Report
No. 08/372, 12/11/08

Summary: Canada’s anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism
(AML/CFT) framework was last assessed by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and the
Asia Pacific Group on Money Laundering (APG) in March 2007. Shortcomings were
identified in particular with respect to the scope of customer due diligence, the
implementation of AML/CFT supervision, and the effectiveness of the financial
intelligence unit (FINTRAC). Since 2007, Canada submitted six follow-up reports to the
FATF, the last one in February 2014, and took a number of steps to strengthen the
framework in these areas. The next mutual evaluation of Canada will be conducted by the
Fund and is scheduled in the fourth quarter of 2015.
Canada: Financial System Stability AssessmentUpdate

IMF Country Report
No. 08/59, 02/13/08

Summary: The FSSA update concluded that Canada’s financial system is mature,
sophisticated, and well-managed. Financial stability was underpinned by sound
macroeconomic policies and strong prudential regulation and supervision, and welldesigned deposit insurance and arrangements for crisis management and failure
resolution. The banking system appeared sound, with stress tests showing that the major
banks could withstand sizeable shocks, although they did faces some challenges related
to the global financial turmoil that started in mid-2007. Also, there were some concerns
about bank attempts to build on their secure domestic position, to enter highly
competitive foreign markets or complex activities. The update reiterated the advantages
of moving towards a single securities regulator, including the streamlining of policy
development, reductions in compliance costs, and improved enforcement. However, it

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CANADA

also recognized the significant improvements to the regulatory system from the creation
of the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA), and the implementation of the passport
system.
Canada: Financial System Stability AssessmentUpdate

IMF Country Report
No. 14/29, 02/03/14

Summary: The FSSA Update found that Canada’s financial system successfully navigated
the global financial crisis, and stress tests suggest that major Canadian financial
institutions are resilient to credit, liquidity, and contagion risks arising from a severe
stress scenario. Elevated house prices and high household debt remain an area of
concern (despite the substantial level of government-guaranteed mortgage insurance),
though targeted prudential and macro-prudential measures are proving to be effective.
The regulatory and supervisory framework demonstrates strong compliance with
international standards. Nevertheless, the Update called for more clarity around the legal
independence of OSFI and for assigning stronger prudential responsibilities to this
regulator. In the securities markets, provincial regulators and the federal government
have made significant progress in implementing a robust and harmonized framework,
but challenges remain in enforcement, risk identification, and timely policy making. The
FSSA Update argued that the federal system of safety nets is credible, although there is
no single body with an explicit mandate to take a comprehensive view of systemic risks
or to undertake crisis preparedness. Improving cooperation between federal and
provincial authorities would further reinforce system-wide oversight arrangements.
Technical Assistance: Not Applicable.
Resident Representative: Not Applicable.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
The quality, coverage, periodicity, and timeliness of Canada’s economic data are considered to be
adequate both in the context of the Article IV consultation and for purposes of ongoing surveillance.
Canada has subscribed to the Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS), and its metadata
are posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB). The data ROSC was
published on October 23, 2003.
Real Sector. Statistics Canada provides timely and adequate data in monthly, quarterly, and annual
frequency thereby facilitating the analyses of economic developments and policy assessments within
a quantitative macroeconomic framework. In May 2001, Statistics Canada effected a smooth
transition from Laspeyres methodology for estimating real expenditure-based GDP to Fisher index
formulae, which enabled more accurate comparison between Canada and other G-7 countries. In
October 2012, Statistics Canada started aligning the Canadian System of National Accounts (CSNA)
with the SNA2008 international standard. The changes introduced in the CSNA2012 included,
among others, capitalization of research and development, move to replacement cost-based
6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CANADA

valuation of consumption of fixed capital, and valuing equity more consistently at market price.
Reflecting resource constraints and data availability, the SNA2008 is planned to be implemented in a
staggered way. Additional changes have been planned with the 2014 release of the CSNA, which
however for the most part would not have a significant impact on GDP and represent the
development of new accounts, improved integration between the CSNA and Government Finance
Statistics, additional detail, and presentational changes that better align with international standards
(see, Statistics Canada). As well, in November 2014, the Statistics Canada published revisions,
(statistical in nature) to the Gross Domestic Product by Income and by Expenditure Accounts for the
period from 2011 to 2013 and 2014Q1–Q2, incorporating the most current data sources, including
survey results, administrative data, public accounts and the annual input-output tables (see,
Statistics Canada). As a result, annual growth rate of real GDP was revised up by 0.5 and
0.2 percentage points in 2011 and 2012, respectively. The main source of the revisions for the three
years is the revision to the value of gross operating surplus. Among the GDP components, in
particular, business gross fixed capital formation (especially nonresidential construction) and exports
(especially services) were revised upward for 2011–13.
Fiscal Sector. Statistics Canada provides quarterly data (a Statement of Government Operations
along with a Balance Sheet) on the general government and its subsectors following the
Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001) recommendations. In November 2014,
Statistics Canada published the provisional (unconsolidated) data on Canadian Government Finance
Statistics (CGFS) for 2008–2012 (see, Statistics Canada). This is the first of three releases covering the
statement of operations for all components of general government, as well as federal and provincial
and territorial government business enterprises. Data on the functional expenses were also released,
to be followed by the publication of financial assets and liabilities in early 2015. Future steps include
publication of consolidated accounts and integration of capital estimates. In addition, the
Department of Finance Canada provides monthly and annual data on the federal government’s
budget (according to the national presentation) and tax policies. The provided data enable adequate
assessment of the impact of fiscal policy measures on Canada’s economic performance.
Financial Sector. The Bank of Canada and OSFI provide monthly and quarterly data on the broad
range of financial variables. However, the 2013 FSSA Update recommended that financial sector
data collection and dissemination should be expanded with a view to enhancing coverage,
regularity, and availability of time-series to facilitate analysis.
Monetary Sector. The Bank of Canada provides timely and adequate coverage of daily, weekly,
monthly, and quarterly data related to the monetary sector.
External Sector. Statistics Canada provides timely information on a quarterly frequency on the
balance of payments, external debt, and the international investment position. Department of
Finance Canada provides monthly data on Official International Reserves in a format comparable to
the IMF’s reserve data template, thus enabling adequate surveillance. Data are published at
http://www.fin.gc.ca/pub/oir-ro-eng.asp.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on Canada
January 28, 2015
1.
This note reports on information that has become available since the staff report
(SM/15/10) was issued and does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
The Bank of Canada unexpectedly lowered its policy rate by 25 basis points on
January 21. In the wake of substantially lower oil prices and increased uncertainty around
an otherwise solid economic outlook, the Bank revised down its projections for GDP growth
by 0.3 percentage points to 2.1 percent for 2015, mostly reflecting slower growth in the first
half of the year. Headline CPI inflation was also revised down below the target range of
1–3 percent in 2015. In a context of higher uncertainty, the Bank stated that monetary easing
is “intended to provide insurance” against downside risks to the inflation profile and financial
stability, support the sectoral adjustment needed to strengthen investment and growth, and
bring the Canadian economy back to full capacity and inflation to target within the projection
horizon (end-2016). In response to the interest rate cut by the Bank of Canada, on the day of
the announcement, the Canadian dollar depreciated further, falling by about 2 percent
vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar, stock prices rose by almost 2 percent, and short-term bond yields
fell sharply (by about 30 basis points) while long-term yields edged down slightly.
3.
Downside risks have risen in light of further oil price declines. Since the staff
report was issued, oil price projections for 2015 have declined further by about 12 percent
based on market futures. This poses further downside risks to staff’s growth and inflation
forecasts for 2015, mainly through weaker investment in the energy sector. In this context,
the central bank’s policy action is in line with staff advice to use available monetary policy
space to mitigate the unfolding effects of downside risks to the outlook that have intensified.
4.
There are welcome signs that activity in the Canadian housing sector may be
cooling, especially in some overheated markets. Against the back drop of weaker oil prices
and terms of trade, home sales fell in December (-5.8 percent, m/m) on the back of muted
growth during the second half of 2014. The number of newly listed homes fell nationally
(-6.8 percent, m/m), with Calgary and Edmonton registering much larger declines.
Residential construction activity continued to moderate, with starts declining to around
180,000 units in 2014, slightly down from 2013 levels. The number of completed and
unabsorbed dwellings continued its downward trajectory in 2014, reaching 201,000 by the
end of the year. House prices though rose 5.4 percent (y/y) in December (close to the
5.3 percent pace in November), led by increases in Calgary and the Greater Toronto Area.
House price appreciation in Calgary, however, has moderated slightly to 8.8 percent in
December, down from 9.2 percent (y/y) in the previous month.
5.
Recent indicators still suggest solid activity continues in the non-energy sector.
The Bank of Canada’s winter Business Outlook Survey continues to provide signs of
strengthening demand, especially among export-oriented firms and manufacturers. However,
the outlook for businesses linked directly or indirectly to the energy sector has deteriorated.
Firms anticipating a positive impact from the U.S. economic outlook are more optimistic
than others. Furthermore, hiring intentions and investment plans are more robust for
manufacturing than other sectors. Canadian manufacturing sales though decreased by
1.4 percent in November, below consensus estimates. The decline was widespread but mostly
driven by motor vehicles, which fell on a monthly basis, but total year-to-date sales were still
5.2 percent higher than in the first eleven months of 2013.

Press Release No. 15/25
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
January 30, 2015

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2014 Article IV Consultation with Canada

On January 28, 2015, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Canada. 1
Canada’s recent growth performance has been solid, alongside a stronger U.S. recovery. U.S.
growth momentum, exchange rate depreciation, and high energy demand in early 2014, all led to
a pickup in exports, although it has yet to translate into strong investment and hiring. In
particular, the slowdown in business investment has been widespread in recent years. Thus, the
composition of growth has not yet shifted away from private consumption and residential
investment to generate a broader, more durable recovery. Substantially lower oil prices will be a
drag on growth through weaker investment in the energy sector. Private consumption has
continued to grow thanks to rising household wealth and exceptionally easy financial conditions.
Indeed, after a brief pause, Canada’s housing market rebounded in 2014, fueled by low and
declining interest rates although there are some welcome signs of cooling especially in
overheated markets. IMF staff analysis suggests a national real house price overvaluation
between 7–20 percent although with important regional differences.
Growth momentum is expected to continue this year, despite substantially lower oil prices, and
become more balanced with a cooling housing market. The stronger U.S. recovery, which is
expected to continue, is leading to higher non-energy exports and supporting investment. These
factors should mostly offset a moderation of private consumption and residential and energy
investment as U.S. interest rates rise, low oil prices persist and households remain highly
indebted. Looking beyond the recent past strength in housing markets, staff continues to expect a
“soft-landing” as higher interest rates and weaker terms-of-trade prospects would temper housing
demand. Downside risks to the outlook have risen in light of further oil price declines, adding to
the risks of weaker global growth and still-unfolding effects from the unusually large fall in oil
prices. Domestic vulnerabilities in housing markets and the household sector remain elevated but
contained from a financial stability perspective. Given interconnections between external and
domestic risks, some risks could occur together.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

2
Public finances continued improving in 2014, reflecting federal and some provincial
consolidation efforts. The general government fiscal deficit is expected to narrow from about
2¾ percent of GDP in 2013 to 1½ percent in 2014, with the federal government essentially on
track to achieving its balanced budget target in FY2015/16 despite lower oil prices. Federal
authorities should consider adopting a neutral stance given past consolidation gains and
downside risks to growth. Such a stance would still be consistent with achieving the longer-term
goals on public debt reduction. Provinces remain committed to their balanced budget targets, but,
for some, fiscal adjustment continues posing challenges. They will need to sustain their efforts to
strengthen public finances, especially in light of longer-term aging-related fiscal pressures.
In the wake of substantially lower oil prices and increased uncertainty around an otherwise solid
economic outlook, the Bank of Canada cut its policy rate by 25 basis points and revised down its
projections for GDP growth and headline inflation, on January 21. The Bank’s policy action is in
line with staff advice to use available monetary policy space should adverse shocks intensify
given the deeper drop in oil prices. Overall, maintaining monetary accommodation along with
gradual fiscal consolidation at the general government level would be conducive to achieving a
growth composition with stronger exports and, thereby, investment in the economy, while
targeted macro-prudential policies would help address housing sector vulnerabilities as needed.
Canadian banks remain highly profitable, with favorable loan quality, low nonperforming loans,
and improving capitalization. Stress tests suggest that banks are resilient to credit, liquidity, and
contagion risks due to their strong capital position, stable funding sources, and low exposures to
the energy sector, as well as extensive government-guaranteed mortgage insurance. Steady
progress has been achieved on key parts of the financial reform agenda, such as on implementing
the Basel III Liquidity Coverage Ratio and leverage standards. Enhanced coordination across
federal and provincial authorities in supervision and stress-testing will further bolster financial
system soundness. Also, strengthening macro-prudential and crisis management frameworks will
reinforce the overall resilience of the financial system.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors agreed with the thrust of the staff appraisal. They welcomed Canada’s
continued solid growth performance, underpinned by the authorities’ sound macroeconomic
policy management. Directors noted that while the outlook remains favorable and growth is
expected to become more balanced with a cooling housing market, risks are tilted to the
downside because of tighter global financial conditions, effects from substantially lower oil
prices, and persisting vulnerabilities in housing market and household sector. Directors agreed
that continued well-calibrated policies should facilitate the needed rebalancing and sustain the
growth momentum. Structural reforms to boost productivity and business investment will also be
important to support medium-term growth.

2

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers
used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

3
Directors agreed that monetary policy should remain accommodative given well-anchored
inflation expectations, sluggish business investment, lower oil prices, and until there are firm
signs of durable recovery with stronger business investment. They supported the Bank of
Canada’s decision to lower the policy rate as it would help further support the economy in light
of the likely adverse effects of the oil price shock. However, they encouraged the authorities to
continue monitoring the impact of monetary policy on household debt and house prices.
Directors acknowledged that macro-prudential measures have been effective in containing
growth of insured mortgage loans, but noted significant rise in uninsured mortgages alongside
still-strong segments of housing markets. They generally agreed that additional macro-prudential
policy action may be needed if household balance sheet and housing market vulnerabilities
resume rising, in particular tighter standards for uninsured mortgages. Directors welcomed the
authorities’ recent initiatives to limit the government’s exposure to the housing sector. They
encouraged further action gradually to ensure appropriate risk retention by the private sector and,
in the longer run, to re-examine the dimensions of extensive government-backed mortgage
insurance.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to fiscal targets and that the federal government
is essentially on track to achieve a balanced budget in 2015. They agreed that fiscal consolidation
should continue at the general government level, but the composition of the fiscal adjustment
would need to shift from the federal government to the provinces. Most Directors saw scope for
the federal government to adopt a neutral stance going forward, given strong adjustment efforts
in recent years. They encouraged using the available fiscal resources for growth-friendly
measures and strengthening the medium-term fiscal frameworks.
Directors agreed that fiscal adjustment at the provincial level would need to proceed, including
through sustained progress in containing aging-related spending and supported by regular
spending reviews. They generally noted that long-term fiscal sustainability challenges call for
extending long-term fiscal forecasts at the provincial level and publishing consolidated general
government fiscal forecasts in consultation with provinces.
Directors noted that Canada’s financial sector continues to be sound and stable and commended
the authorities for the progress on the international reform agenda. They welcomed the progress
made in implementing several recommendations of the 2013 update of the Financial Sector
Assessment Program (FSAP) and generally encouraged the authorities to move forward with the
outstanding FSAP recommendations. In general, Directors noted that further enhancing
supervisory cooperation across federal and provincial authorities, harmonized stress-testing of
systemically-important depository institutions, and strengthening macro-prudential and crisis
management frameworks would reinforce the resilience of Canada’s financial system. A few
Directors observed that focusing more on outcomes with respect to financial sector performance
and allowing greater flexibility as regards frameworks or structures to achieve them could be
beneficial.
