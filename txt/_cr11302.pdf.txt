STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2011 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
August 5, 2011

KEY ISSUES
Prospects: Real GDP growth, driven up to 13 percent in 2010 by a record crop, is
projected to moderate to 3 percent in 2011, but high oil prices and the completion of
the new oil field and refinery projects have strengthened the fiscal and external
outlooks. In 2012, the coming on line of new energy and cement projects will drive
growth over 7 percent; growth should moderate thereafter given declining oil output.
Restoring Budget Discipline: Some effort was made to restore budget discipline in
2010 and early 2011, but deeper public financial management reform is needed to
ensure compliance with budget targets and the execution of priority social spending.
Medium-Term Fiscal Outlook: The 2010 oil price recovery fuelled a procyclical fiscal
expansion, leaving the budget highly vulnerable to a drop in oil revenues. To ensure
sustainability, fiscal policy needs to be formulated in a multiyear framework that can
cope with oil price volatility and the anticipated gradual drop in oil production.
Adopting an explicit savings target and an expenditure smoothing policy will help.
The Financial Sector and the Business Environment: Chadian banks are heavily
exposed to the government and therefore also indirectly vulnerable to oil price
volatility. Chad scores poorly on international investment rankings, and improving the
basic business environment is critical to non-oil growth.
Resuming the Path Toward Debt Relief: The authorities are eager to re-engage in
program discussions to achieve the completion point under the Initiative for Heavily
Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) as quickly as feasible. IMF staff are working with the
authorities to lay the necessary groundwork.

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

CHAD

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Chad’s internal security situation has
improved, but the crisis in Libya poses risks.
The United Nations peacekeeping mission for
Chad and the Central African Republic
(MINURCAT) completed its mandate on
December 31, 2010. The February 2010 peace
pact with Sudan is holding, and Chadian forces
have defeated a remaining rebel group in the
Central African Republic. More than
70,000 people fleeing violence in Libya have
been repatriated to or via Chad, with the help of
international agencies.
2.
The political situation is relatively
calm. President Déby (in office since 1990) was
reelected on April 25, 2011. The president’s
party and its allies won 133 of 188 seats in the
National Assembly on February 13, 2011.
Appointment of a new cabinet is expected
after the presidential inauguration, slated for

August. However, the election results have not
been universally accepted (opposition leaders
boycotted the elections and alleged fraud) and
local elections, originally scheduled for
summer, have been postponed until October
to allow for better preparation. Meanwhile,
opposition members have formed a united
front in the National Assembly.
3.
The newly reelected president
campaigned on a platform of renaissance,
aiming to transform Chad into a
middle-income economy diversified away
from oil. To accelerate non-oil growth and
stem the impact that dwindling oil reserves will
have on income, exports, and fiscal revenues,
the government has been pursuing an
ambitious public investment program and
foreign direct investment-led industrialization.

II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
A. The 2010 Recovery
4.
With real GDP growth reaching
13 percent in 2010, Chad recovered
strongly from the 2009 downturn. In a
temporary reversal of a declining trend (oil
reserves are expected to be largely exhausted
by 2030), oil production increased in 2010, as
high oil prices justified additional investment
to bolster extraction rates. Most importantly,
with favorable rains and government measures
to provide agricultural inputs, as well as
increased cultivated area, agricultural
production nearly doubled and food and
consumer prices declined. Nevertheless,
despite the favorable conditions in the

4

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

international cotton market, cotton output (the
main traditional export commodity) remained
low, mainly owing to the dire financial
condition of the cotton parastatal
(Cotontchad), and the ensuing neglect of
cotton cultivation.
5.
The overall fiscal position improved
in 2010, reflecting higher-than-projected oil
prices and increased non-oil tax revenue.
The overall fiscal deficit (excluding grants,
commitments basis) shrank from 21 percent of
non-oil GDP in 2009 to about 11 percent in

B. Recent Developments, Outlook, and Risks
10.
Overall GDP growth is projected to
moderate to about 3 percent in 2011. Oil
production is expected to decline slightly,
despite the contribution from the new, but
relatively small field (Bongor), operated by the
China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC).
In June, Bongor began producing
20,000 barrels per day (bpd) to feed the new
oil refinery, which opened shortly thereafter.3
With agricultural output expected to revert to
the underlying trend, non-oil GDP growth is
projected to moderate to 3.6 percent.
11.
In 2012, growth is expected to spike
above 7 percent, reflecting the oil refinery’s
first full year in operation and new
industrial projects entering production,
including a power station and a cement
factory. Also, crude oil production is expected
to spike in 2012, although output from the
main oil field at Doba is expected to decline or,
at best, remain at the current level of about

Consumer price inflation remained

local media reported that some food prices
rose in the second quarter, possibly owing
to the seasonal depletion of food stocks.
Overall, consumer price inflation (period
average) is not expected to exceed 2 percent
in 2011 and 3 percent in 2012.4 However,
prices of intermediate goods (e.g., cement)
and wages of skilled labor are reported to be
rising, owing to demand pressures from public
investment.

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Box 1. Chad: Exchange Rate and External Competitiveness Assessment
Chad’s external competitiveness is heavily influenced by
a number of exogenous factors, including oil prices and
the euro/US dollar exchange rate. Competitiveness is
also affected by a narrow domestic non-oil production
base, significant natural barriers to trade, and weak
institutions.
In recent years, Chad’s real effective exchange rate
(REER) has been tracking closely the CEMAC’s gradually
appreciating REER, with minor deviations reflecting
mainly fluctuations in Chad’s inflation path compared to
the region’s average. Thus, staff’s assessment of
CEMAC’s external sustainability and non-oil REER also
applies to Chad, suggesting that, under current policies,
Chad’s REER is broadly in line with fundamentals.
This is confirmed by applying various CGER
methodologies for Chad, placing its non-oil REER at
2–6 percentage points above the norm, depending on
1
the approach used. Using the modified methodology,
based on Bems/de Carvalho Filho (2009), which was
applied in the recent assessment of CEMAC’s REER,
Chad’s non-oil REER is overvalued by close to 15
percent, very much in line with the REER in the CEMAC
area as a whole. The test relies on a current account
norm derived from the assumption that oil wealth is
used for smoothing inter-temporal consumption.

By construction, both norms disregard investment
expenditure, which accentuates estimated overvaluation
if the medium-term current account is heavily
influenced by public investment (as is the case in Chad),
even if the investment is sound.
Chad’s strong oil-export driven external position
projected over the medium term may result in further
appreciation of its REER. Given the diminishing oil
resource base, a prolonged continuation of this trend
would be harmful to Chad’s competitiveness. Chad’s
fragile domestic production base, including for the
traditional export products, and high production, capital
and productivity-adjusted labor costs in other sectors,
suggest that a real depreciation would help diversify its
export production consistent with the forward-looking
pro-poor policies for the post-oil era. Chad ranks last
among 183 countries under the World Bank/IFC Doing
Business 2011 index. Thus, policies to address Chad’s
competitiveness challenges should rely mainly on
structural measures to improve the business
environment.

of non-oil GDP. This is due equally to
spending overruns, mainly on security, and a
non-oil revenue shortfall (20 percent below
expectations through May). In February, the
government suspended commitments for
recurrent purchases of goods and services
until further notice, and suspended purchases
of vehicles for investment projects until
end-2012. These measures apparently did not
cover extraordinary security spending, which
by end-May had already reached 90 percent of
budget authorization.5 Public investment
spending has also kept pace, but priority social
spending has not.
14.
The authorities have taken some
steps to improve the budget process, but
PFM problems persist. The 2010 budget was
closed at end-February (per the organic
budget law) and a new macro-framework was
prepared for the 2012 budget (Box 2). There
was some reduction in the use of DAOs for

non-emergency spending, but extra-budgetary
spending continued, notably under the
conventions that allow their beneficiaries (e.g.,
the electricity company as a recipient of fuel
subsidies, or some government suppliers) to
receive payments, even absent a budget
allocation. Despite high oil revenues, half of
the end-2010 treasury float (5.5 percent of
non-oil GDP) slipped into arrears.
15.
Given the government’s underlying
fiscal stance, a sharp decline in oil prices
remains the main risk to the budget.
Without a financial cushion in the form of
government deposits, such a shock would
imply a forced fiscal tightening, a significant
investment slowdown, and increased domestic
arrears, possibly including arrears to the
central bank.6 In turn, government suppliers
may be unable to service their debts, and
banks’ nonperforming loans would rise.

III. RESTORING BUDGET DISCIPLINE
Since the beginning of the oil era, Chad has pursued an expansionary and procyclical
fiscal policy, straining the absorptive capacity of the economy and the public financial
management (PFM) capacity of the administration (particularly procurement). Improving
budget discipline will require measures to strengthen PFM, especially spending controls.

Box 3. Chad: Public Expenditure Review Update
The 2011 World Bank report on Chad’s Public
Expenditure Review (covering the period from 2004 to
2009) found that budget execution during that period
did not reflect strategic priorities set in Chad’s Poverty
Reduction Strategies (PRS).1 It also identified multiple
weaknesses in public expenditure management that
hampered delivery of public services in health and
education and other areas critical for economic and
social development.
Poverty reduction objectives were broadly reflected in
budgetary allocations. Priority sectors accounted on
average for 62.4 percent of the total budget (excluding
debt service and security) compared to the target of
62.2 percent implied by the PRS. However, within the
PRS priority spending, education, health and social
protection and rural development received on average
only 72 percent of the shares of spending called for by
the PRS. In contrast, budgeted shares for governance
(including allocation for departments of justice, human
rights, and decentralization, as well as the State Control
Office, the Supreme Court, and Economic and Social
Council) and infrastructure were respectively 26 percent
higher and almost twice the implied PRS targets.
Moreover, the executed amounts of priority spending
were well below the budgeted amounts. The highest
rate of execution was in spending on infrastructure
(90 percent of budgetary allocations) and, to a lower
extent, on rural development. Spending budgeted for
health and education was crowded out by unbudgeted
spending in other areas. Consequently, Chad performed
poorly compared with other sub-Saharan African
countries in terms of its allocation of public resources
(measured in percent of GDP or in per capita dollar
terms) to health and education.

revenue effort remains low. This lack of budget
discipline has led to repeated budget overruns,
cash flow difficulties, and domestic arrears.
Staff's Views

Staff encouraged the authorities to

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Shortcomings in expenditure management have
contributed to Chad’s failure in making serious dent
into poverty reduction. Some improvements were made
in budget preparation and macroeconomic forecasting,
but a limited use of multi-year fiscal framework and the
absence of a formal project management system
created problems: there is no formal project
preparation, adoption, programming, and budgeting
framework. Also, a large share of expenditures being
executed without prior authorization has a crowding

the PRS priority spending include: (i) simplifying the exante manual oversight of delegated appropriations for
regions; (ii) stopping the practice of freezing ministries’
operating expenditures during preparation of budget

Chad’s First National Poverty Reduction Strategy (NPRS-I)
was adopted in June 2003. Its implementation was
undermined by persistent conflict, weak governance, and lack
of ownership of economic and social reforms. A new strategy
(NPRS-II)—covering the 2008–11 period—was adopted in April
2008. It focused on a narrower set of priorities than NPRS-I:
creation of a business climate that is conducive to private
sector growth, rural development programs, investments in
human capital, and on strengthening governance.

expenditure; eliminating payments to
government suppliers in excess of budget
allocations; and observing strictly the public
procurement code. Beyond these immediate
measures, a comprehensive PFM reform
program should focus on harmonizing local
practices with the recently revised CEMAC
guidelines. Staff encouraged the authorities to
establish a timetable and identify the technical
assistance needed to align Chad’s PFM laws
and practices with the new guidelines.
Authorities' Views
19.
The authorities intend to break from
the past lax PFM and budget execution,
building on the steps taken to strengthen
budget discipline in 2010 and 2011. They
affirmed their intention to: (i) contain the
NOPD overrun in 2011 to no more than the
2.5–3.0 percent of non-oil GDP accrued in the

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

first half of the year; and (ii) return in the
second half of the year to the NOPD path
implied by the 2011 budget as approved by
parliament. This would ensure a NOPD
reduction of about 8 percentage points of
non-oil GDP compared with the 2010 outcome
and, with projected 2011 oil revenue of
$2 billion, an overall surplus of about 4 percent
of non-oil GDP. The measures required to
achieve this adjustment are yet to be
stipulated in a supplementary budget law,
which would need to be passed by the
newly-elected parliament. In the second half of
2011, the authorities intend to execute all
investment spending through the regular
budget process and to adhere strictly to the
procurement rules. They also intend to
introduce in the 2012 budget a clear
distinction between appropriations to pay for
previous projects and commitment
authorizations for new projects.

IV. MEDIUM-TERM FISCAL POLICY
Chad needs a medium-term fiscal strategy that recognizes the challenges and risks of
dependence on oil revenue. Its success will hinge on the government’s ability to keep the
investment program within realistic proportions, while strengthening non-oil revenue
effort and using a portion of oil revenue as a buffer against oil price volatility.
Background
20.
In view of the expected steady
decline of oil production, the current fiscal
stance raises concerns about sustainability.
With non-oil revenues at about 12 percent
(one fourth less than the average of other oil
exporting countries in sub-Saharan Africa),
Chad does not have much to lean on when oil
production ends. And some contemplated
large public investment projects pose an
additional risk.10 Also, Chad’s procyclical fiscal
policy makes it very vulnerable to oil price
shocks; this became particularly pronounced

during 2009 slump in the oil market, leading to
a sharp deterioration in both the fiscal and the
external positions. Further, spending structure
has been biased toward investment spending
(of the brick and mortar type) with insufficient
provisions for equipment purchases (e.g., for
the newly-built schools and medical centers),
staffing, and operations and maintenance.
_______________________________________
10

In early 2011, the authorities signed letters of intent with
Chinese enterprises for the construction of an airport ($1 billion)
and railway ($7.5 billion); the combined total value of these
projects exceeds Chad’s 2011 GDP.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 13

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

CHAD

Staff's Views
21.
Staff emphasized the need to: utilize
a multiyear budget framework, smooth
expenditure over the medium term, and
create a savings buffer against oil price
shocks. Recognizing that the current oil price
outlook offers room for a less sharp fiscal
adjustment than recommended last year, staff
suggested reducing the NOPD gradually,
along a medium-term path about
6 percentage points of non-oil GDP higher
than previously recommended.11
22.
The additional fiscal space could be
used for maintenance of infrastructure or
for recurrent or capital spending (notably,
on equipment) in the social sectors. Room
to maneuver could be increased further by
reducing subsidies to public enterprises and
aligning investment spending with the
absorption capacity of the economy and the
need to sustain growth beyond the oil boom.
In this context, staff cautioned against using
the proceeds of the savings bond issue to fund
new capital spending (paragraph 30). To cope
with the risk inherent in depending on oil
revenues, the authorities should save a part of
oil revenue, identify contingencies within the
investment program, and stand ready to delay
_______________________________________
11

The analysis in the 2010 Article IV report, based on the
permanent income hypothesis (PIH), placed a sustainable NOPD
within 1–5 percent of non-oil GDP, and staff recommended that
this level of NOPD be reached by 2020, in step with the
expected decline in oil revenues. The revised World Economic
Outlook oil price baseline projections (Spring 2011 vintage)
imply oil revenues during 2011–30 over 40 percent higher than
projected last year. The current long-term scenario features an
adjustment path that would allow the government to sustain an
NOPD of about 5 percent of non-oil GDP beyond 2030. Staff
also recognizes that, without undermining Chad’s public debt
sustainability, more borrowing from the domestic and regional
market would be needed in the long term to sustain the
development of the non-oil economy.

or suspend commitments to lower-priority
new projects in the event of budget overruns
or revenue shortfalls.
23.
A prudent medium-term fiscal
strategy is an asset/liability management
challenge. Given the current outlook, the
authorities would be able to repay statutory
advances from the BEAC by 2014, as required,
and during that time accumulate savings of
about 12 percent of non-oil GDP. This would
protect the treasury against a negative oil price
shock comparable to that which occurred in
2009 and allow time for adjusting fiscal policy
stance as needed. Staff thus advised the
authorities to seek agreement with the BEAC
on a strategy for asset/liability management to
increase the expected yield from Chad’s
financial investments, without compromising
their safety. Staff also encouraged the
authorities to continue to observe the CEMAC
rules on the repatriation of foreign currencydenominated revenue, and to support the
program to strengthen the BEAC safeguards.
24.
Considering the government has
already assumed significant liabilities and
risks in the context of the joint venture oil
refinery with CNPC, staff recommended
that the authorities commission feasibility
and economic impact studies of the
contemplated major infrastructure projects
(railroad and airport) and—should the
projects be approved as sound—seek
concessional funds for their financing. Even
if deemed to be economically sound, because
of their magnitude and associated debt
sustainability implications, these projects
should be integrated in the authorities’
medium-term expenditure outlook, rather than
treated as additional to it (Box 4).

CHAD

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Box 4. Chad: Debt Sustainability
The staffs’ assessment of Chad’s debt
vulnerability and risk of debt distress, which
remains moderate, have not changed since the
2010 debt sustainability analysis. In the baseline
scenario, public and publicly-guaranteed
external debt indicators remain well below the
indicative thresholds through the projection
horizon. The rate of debt accumulation in 2010
(year-to-year change in the present value of
debt to GDP) was lower than projected, as the
authorities drew only about two-thirds of the
nonconcessional budget loan.

of GDP threshold in 2015 and peaks in 2023,
implying an increased risk of debt distress. This
analysis suggests that, even if financed
concessionally, these large projects pose a risk to
debt sustainability and must be assessed for
their benefits vis-à-vis other priority spending.
Chad’s debt sustainability outlook also remains
highly sensitive to an oil price shock. A shock
scenario, in which export growth falls in
proportion to a two-standard-deviation lower oil
price, would place debt on a path that breaches
and remains persistently above most debt
indicator thresholds, implying an increased risk
of debt distress.

New nonconcessional borrowing for major
projects could jeopardize sustainability. In the
railroad/airport scenario, the authorities contract
$8.5 billion-worth of debt to finance the
contemplated projects, with a grant element of
65 percent and 33 percent (in a concessional and
nonconcessional variant, respectively). No
growth acceleration is assumed. Under either set
of terms, the debt path breaches the 30 percent

Debt relief at the HIPC completion point would
cut Chad’s external debt by half. Debt eligible for
treatment under the Enhanced HIPC Initiative
and MDRI totals nearly $1 billion in nominal
terms, and its cancellation would yield debt
service savings of about $40 million per year.

Authorities' Views

The authorities’ medium-term scenario calls
for an adjustment toward a sustainable NOPD;
however, the authorities assume a significantly
better projected end-2011 fiscal position (in

share staff’s concerns about limited absorptive

25.
The authorities agreed with staff
that a sharp decline in oil revenues is the

capacity. Their scenario is predicated on a
leveling-off of public investment and better
procurement and project control, both of
which are intended to address the pressures
on absorptive capacity. The authorities also see
the continued improvement in security as
critical to providing fiscal space for public
investment and other development spending.

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

26.
The authorities expect that ongoing
tax and customs administration reforms will
strengthen non-oil revenues. Notably, the
new customs data and payments processing
system (SYDONIA) has already begun to
improve customs revenue. They also hope that
some progress can be made in eliminating
arbitrary tax exemptions, which reduced
non-oil tax revenue collection in early 2011.

V. THE FINANCIAL SECTOR AND THE BUSINESS
ENVIRONMENT
Chad’s financial system is underdeveloped and heavily exposed to the government, while
local entrepreneurs remain credit-constrained and face a generally inhospitable business
environment. Business-friendly tax reforms and other policy reforms could have a high
yield in regard to non-oil growth.
Background
27.
Compared to other low-income
sub-Saharan African countries,
monetization and credit to the private
sector are low in Chad. The financial sector is
underdeveloped, with eight commercial banks,
two insurance companies, and two pension
funds. Interbank transactions are minimal and
there is no established liquid market for
government debt. The banks were not directly
affected by the global financial crisis, but are
heavily exposed to the government and
therefore highly vulnerable to oil price
volatility. Foreign-owned private banks are
well-capitalized, but domestic banks, all with
significant government ownership, are not. The
predominantly state-owned banks have
insufficient capital, which weighs heavily on
the capital adequacy indicator for the banking
sector as a whole (Text Table 2).

28.
Chad ranks low on international
measures of the quality of the business
environment.12 Impediments to private-sector
investment and trade include weak
enforcement of property rights, judicial
ineffectiveness, costly and unreliable electrical
and telecommunications services, a lack of
skilled workers, administrative and financial
barriers to formally establishing a business,
and the government’s persistent arrears to
suppliers. The tax system is needlessly
burdensome to formal businesses, with a high
marginal corporate income tax rate and a
multitude of nuisance taxes and fees that drive
up compliance costs.

29.
Regarding bank stability, staff
recommended that the authorities seek new
private capital for predominantly stateowned banks; work with the other CEMAC
members to reinforce the regional
regulator’s (COBAC) legal framework, and
national offices’ powers, to intervene in
troubled banks; and align the single
exposure limits with international
standards.14 At the same time, staff suggested
that Chadian banks strengthen their own risk
management to monitor portfolio
concentration. The banks’ largest individual

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

exposures are well above the regional limit
that in turn, at 45 percent of capital, is higher
than international best practice suggests.
_______________________________________
13

Staff’s views and recommendations regarding financial
sector issues draw on the observations made by the
overlapping joint Bank/IMF FSAP mission.

14

Over the current year, Chad will occupy the chair of key
CEMAC councils, and the staff suggested that the authorities
take this opportunity to accelerate the strengthening of the
key regional institutions, the central bank (BEAC), and the
prudential regulator (COBAC).

CHAD

30.
To promote financial sector
development, staff encouraged the
authorities to take the lead in issuing
government debt instruments on the
regional government securities market.
Encouraged by Cameroon’s example, in July,
the authorities completed a sale of over
CFAF 100 billion of five-year bonds with a
6 percent coupon. Sixty-three percent of the
issue was purchased by Chadian residents.
Two-thirds of the issue was purchased by
banks, local and regional. Nevertheless, staff
thinks that a predictable, regular issue of
short-term paper would be more efficient than
occasional placements of long-term savings
bonds. Given government spending
commitments and the marked quarterly
pattern of oil revenue inflows, good treasury
management requires a short-term financing
facility, to meet monthly payment pressures
and avoid running domestic arrears. It would
also have advantages from debt-management
and financial sector development perspective.
31.
Regarding the broader business
environment, staff highlighted tax and
regulatory measures that could be
implemented quickly, based on technical
assistance already received. Recommended
tax measures include (i) reducing the corporate
income tax rate from 40 percent to 35 percent;
(ii) eliminating various special and
administrative levies, especially those collected
by ministries and other administrations; and
(iii) eliminating, or at least reducing the
minimum corporate tax from 1.5 percent to
1 percent. Recommended regulatory measures
include (i) removing needless administrative

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

barriers to formal incorporation;
(ii) establishing a one stop shop for business
services; and (iii) maintaining a forum for
ongoing, regular business-government
dialogue.
Authorities' Views
32.
The authorities welcomed the indepth attention of the Financial Sector
Assessment Program (FSAP) team to Chad’s
financial sector. In their preliminary reactions,
the authorities expressed skepticism about the
effectiveness of market signals and the private
sector’s ability to provide funding for
businesses and households in a low-income
environment. The authorities continue to favor
special-purpose financial institutions and to
insist on a role for government as a bank
shareholder. However, they took note of the
call to work with other CEMAC members to
strengthen the capacity and independence of
the regional regulator.
33.
Regarding the proposed tax
measures, the authorities agreed with the
thrust of staff’s suggestions. They pointed
out that (i) a reduction, along with its
harmonization at the CEMAC level, of the
corporate income tax is of the utmost urgency;
(ii) the elimination of special and
administrative levies will be considered in the
very short term at the government level; and
(iii) a reduction of the minimum corporate
income tax will be considered in the medium
term, mainly for revenue reasons.

VI. RESUMING THE PATH TOWARD DEBT RELIEF
The authorities are eager to take advantage of the government’s renewed political
mandate to re-engage in program discussions with the IMF and World Bank to achieve
the HIPC completion point as quickly as possible.
Background
34.
Chad reached the Decision Point
under the Enhanced HIPC Initiative in May
2001, but has been unable to complete a
review under an IMF financial arrangement
since 2004. A PRGF-supported program
(2005) and a staff-monitored program (SMP)
(2009) went off track rapidly because of fiscal
slippages. Discussions on a possible SMP for
2010 were fruitless. At the conclusion of last
year’s Article IV consultation, directors noted
that improved fiscal policy and PFM would
pave the way for an agreement on an SMP.
35.
The authorities have sought an
agreement with IMF and World Bank staff
on policies that could be supported by an
SMP, which could pave the way to a
successor program under the Extended
Credit Facility (ECF), and to HIPC debt relief.
They also plan to hold an economic policy
forum in late 2011, involving a broad range of
stakeholders, to consider ideas that could
contribute to an updated growth and poverty
reduction strategy.
Staff's Views
36.
Staff is working with the Chadian
authorities to put in place policies necessary

growth and that could be supported under

an SMP. The agreed steps toward an SMP
include (i) adopting a supplementary budget
to regularize the extra-budgetary spending
incurred in the first half of 2011; (ii) returning
to the quarterly NOPD path implied by the
original 2011 budget law for the rest of the
year, while ensuring effective spending
allocations for social sectors (health and
education); and (iii) avoiding emergency
payment procedures (DAO) for spending that
lacks prior budgetary appropriation or that
does not constitute a bona fide emergency.15
Authorities’ Views
37.
The authorities suggested that the
HIPC scenario should be accelerated,
recognizing Chad’s special post-conflict
circumstances and the progress in economic
policy since peace was restored. The
authorities also see the benefits of a closer
collaboration with IMF and World Bank staffs
in designing their long-term growth strategy
and framing appropriately the intended
foreign-financed large infrastructure projects.
_______________________________________
15

Staff also pointed out that timely provision of complete
monthly fiscal accounts and a reconciliation of the treasury net
credit to the government data with the monetary survey would
be required to monitor an SMP.

CHAD

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

VII. STAFF APPRAISAL
38.
Higher oil prices have relaxed
financing constraints in the short term,
offering additional fiscal space for growthenhancing and poverty-reducing spending.
Continued investment in the oil sector and an
impressive recovery in agriculture (shielding
Chad from international food price pressure)
yielded strong growth in 2010.
39.
New industrial projects in oil
refining, electrical generation, and cement
production will contribute to stronger
growth over the medium term and also
help reduce the cost of public and private
investment. However, these new (largely
state-owned) enterprises should be operated
on a sound financial basis and not rely on
government financial support.
40.
To sustain growth and make
efficient use of its resources, Chad should
rationalize its fiscal policy and improve
budget execution. Building on the steps that
have already been taken to improve budget
preparation, strengthen procurement
procedures, and reduce extra-budgetary
spending, the authorities should take strong
measures to improve public financial
management and address the leakage of nonoil revenues, especially at customs. It is also
important that the authorities follow through
on plans to clear domestic arrears and
continue to service domestic debt.
41.
Staff commends the authorities for
developing a systematic approach to
medium-term fiscal programming. However,
within the medium-term framework, greater
focus is needed on building a savings cushion
against oil price shocks, smoothing

expenditure (in particular, investment
spending) to ensure sustainability, and
providing adequately for recurrent social
spending (e.g., on staffing, equipping, and
maintaining medical centers and schools).
42.
Rethinking public investment policy
is needed to ensure macroeconomic
stability and sustain growth. The investment
program needs to be calibrated to reduce the
pressure on wages, prices, and the external
position. This would also help avoid pressure
to resort to nonconcessional borrowing,
which could undermine debt sustainability,
reduces Chad’s access to concessional
resources, and perhaps delay Chad’s
achieving the HIPC Completion Point. To
avoid potential abrupt stops in the execution
of the public investment program, a portion
of investment outlays should be made
contingent on the realization of optimistic oil
or non-oil revenue forecasts.
43.
The private sector should be able to
operate more freely, to be in a position to
contribute to growth, economic
diversification, and job creation. The
establishment of a one stop shop for investors
is a priority. Regulatory actions to improve the
business environment should be
supplemented by tax policy measures to
strengthen incentives for private investment
and foster compliance.
44.
Policy actions are needed to enable
Chad to take advantage of favorable
international market conditions for cotton
exports. To that end, an in-depth
restructuring of Cotontchad is essential, along
with greater participation of the private sector

in the cotton industry for it to become a
source of growth, rural development, and
poverty reduction.
45.
Chad could show leadership in the
development of the regional money
market by regularly issuing short-term
treasury bills as soon as it is technically
feasible. This would improve government
liquidity management and reduce payment
delays, and would also contribute to financial
sector development by sending, CEMAC-wide,
a clear market signal of a point on the yield
curve. Government involvement in ownership
and management of banks is excessive, and
the provision of capital by new private
partners would be beneficial.

22

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

46.
Staff is responding to the
authorities’ renewed interest in an SMP,
which could pave the way to an ensuing
program under the ECF and to the HIPC
Completion Point. This new start must be
well prepared to ensure success of the
program. The staff thus welcomed the
proposed economic policy conference and
plans to participate, alongside other
international development partners, to help
articulate policies that could be supported by
an SMP and a subsequent ECF arrangement.

Under the enhanced framework, an additional disbursement is made at the completion point
corresponding to interest income earned on the amount committed at the decision point but not
disbursed during the interim period.

VIII.

Safeguards Assessments

The Bank of the Central African States (BEAC)
is the regional central bank of the Central
African States. The most recent safeguards
assessment of the BEAC was completed on
July 6, 2009. The findings of this assessment
indicate that implementation of previous
safeguards recommendations on financial
reporting, internal audit, and internal control
has been limited, and that the changing risk
profile of the BEAC foreign exchange holdings
requires further actions to strengthen
safeguards at the BEAC. Subsequent to
revelation of Paris office fraud, a series of
initial measures and longer term reforms was

agreed between IMF and BEAC in order to
continue with country programs. BEAC
adopted an action plan for 2010 with the aim
of reforming its own governance, and
strengthening key safeguards. Implementation
delays and additional safeguard concerns
raised in the first special audit triggered a
suspension of Fund disbursements to CEMAC
countries from June through early August
2010, after which they resumed. A recent
safeguards monitoring mission has identified a
new series of rolling benchmarks to address
outstanding safeguards concerns going
forward.

IX. Exchange Rate Arrangement
Chad maintains an exchange system that is
free from restrictions and multiple currency
practices on payments and transfers for
current international transactions. The BEAC
common currency is the CFA franc, which was
formerly pegged to the French franc and is
now pegged to the euro. Repurchase of
CFA franc banknotes exported outside the
BEAC zone was suspended on August 2, 1993.
Effective January 12, 1994, the CFA franc was
devalued by 50 percent in foreign currency

terms, and the exchange rate was adjusted
from F 1 = CFAF 50 to F 1 = CFAF 100. Since
January 1, 1999, the CFA franc has been
pegged to the euro at the rate of
EUR 1 = CFAF 655.957.
X. Article IV Consultations
Chad is on the 12-month cycle. The next
Article IV consultation is expected to take
place by June 2012.

STATISTICAL ISSUES APPENDIX
As of July 25, 2011
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data has serious shortcomings that significantly hamper surveillance. Shortcomings are most
serious in government finance and balance of payments. The 2007 Report on the Observance of
Standards and Codes (ROSC) found that the statistical system was weak and suffers from a shortage
of both financial and human resources. In addition, the GDDS metadata needs to be updated.
National Accounts: The authorities have revised national accounts estimates, moving from the 1968
to the 1993 SNA, for 2005–10. However, compilation remains weak due to inadequate funding for the
Institut National de la Statistique, des Etudes Economiques et Démographiques (INSEED). In addition,
dissemination of data and metadata to the public could be improved by more timely releases and
more detailed information.
Price statistics: The Harmonized Consumer Price Index (IHPC) has weaknesses in coverage and
timeliness. It covers only the capital city and the reporting lag often exceeds two months. The regional
authorities have work underway to improve the reliability of the IHPC in each CEMAC member.
Government finance statistics: Data weaknesses create uncertainty about the central government’s
actual fiscal position and hamper debt sustainability analysis Staff is compelled to prepare estimates
of central government financial operations from disparate administrative sources that may or may not
reconcile with domestic bank financing or changes in net indebtedness.
Monetary statistics: BEAC reports the expected core monetary and financial indicators within the
expected lag, albeit not in the latest reporting structure. A key shortcoming of monetary and financial
statistics is the lack of clear reconciliation between the domestic banking sector’s net credit to the
government and the implicit financing in the weak government financial accounts. In addition, the
depository corporations’ survey omits the large number of microfinance operations in the country.
Balance of payments: Weaknesses in Chad’s balance of payments data create uncertainty about the
country’s actual external position and hamper debt sustainability analysis. Customs-based data are
unreliable and suffer from coverage problems, to the extent that they are not relied upon for balance
of payments or national income estimation. Staff is compelled to estimate current and capital flows
from disparate administrative sources, to supplement the official balance of payments. Chad has yet
to submit BOP and IIP data for 2006–08 to STA. STA has recommended tighter coordination among
the CEMAC, INSEED, and other agencies in order to improve data coverage. BEAC headquarters is
coordinating technical reforms to improve data quality and timeliness.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Participant in the IMF’s General Data

III. Reporting to STA (Optional)
Only international liquidity, monetary statistics, GDP, and prices are currently reported to STA for
publication in the International Financial Statistics. Chad has not yet been able to resume reporting of
detailed data for publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook. Annual fiscal data through
2001 have been reported and are included in the International Finance Statistics (IFS) database. The
BEAC has yet to submit test monetary and financial statistics using the standardized report forms.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2011 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Approved By
Jeffrey Lewis and Jan
Walliser (IDA), Seán
Nolan and Dhaneshwar
Ghura (IMF)

Prepared by the staffs of the International Development
Association and the International Monetary Fund

The staffs’ assessment of Chad’s debt vulnerability and risk of debt distress, which
remains moderate, has not changed since the 2010 debt sustainability analysis (DSA).
The assumptions underpinning the DSA are also quite similar, except for an upward
revision of current and projected oil prices. Public and publicly-guaranteed external debt
and debt service indicators remain well below the indicative thresholds through the
projection horizon. However, Chad’s debt sustainability outlook remains highly sensitive
to an oil price shock. Should a decline in oil price similar to that experienced in 2009
reoccur, all debt and debt service ratios would be breached and remain persistently above
most debt indicator thresholds. Furthermore, borrowing to finance contemplated major
projects would also jeopardize sustainability.

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS CHAD

BACKGROUND
Recent Developments in Public External
Debt

Status of Implementation of Debt Relief
Initiatives

1.
Chad’s external public debt burden
diminished considerably in 2001–08, thanks to
strong oil sector-driven growth and low
borrowing from abroad. Even in 2009,
notwithstanding a sharp deterioration of the fiscal
position, external public debt decreased in
nominal terms. With a steep drop in oil revenue,
the overall fiscal deficit (excluding grants) reached
about 22 percent of non-oil GDP, but it was
largely financed by depleting government
deposits and drawing statutory advances from the
central bank. However, the negative GDP shock in
2009 pushed up the external public debt-to-GDP
ratio.

3.
Poor macroeconomic policy
performance has prevented Chad from
reaching the completion point under the
Enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries
(HIPC) Initiative. Chad reached the Decision
Point under the Enhanced HIPC Initiative in May
2001. Chad’s inability to meet agreed fiscal targets
and to implement satisfactorily a program under
the IMF’s Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility
(PRGF) has been the principal obstacle to debt
relief. The 2005 PRGF expired in 2008 without any
reviews being concluded. Subsequent efforts to
resume the path toward debt relief with the
support of IMF Staff-Monitored Programs (SMP)
were also hindered by fiscal slippages. Progress
towards other completion point triggers1 has
either been slow or early gains have been
followed by subsequent deterioration. 2

2.
In 2010, the authorities borrowed
abroad on nonconcessional terms and external
debt picked up. As a result, the rate of debt
accumulation (the year-to-year change in present
value (PV) of debt relative to previous year’s GDP)
spiked due in part to the low grant element of
new borrowing (from Libya and China). The
external public debt-to-GDP ratio reached about
25 percent compared with 27½ percent
anticipated in the 2010 DSA, as the overall fiscal
situation was slightly better, and recourse to
external borrowing was lower than anticipated.
With the rebound in oil prices, the overall fiscal
deficit (excluding grants) dropped to around
12 percent of non-oil GDP, but the external
current account deficit widened to 35 percent of
GDP, because of the high import content of
investment spending (notably, in the oil and
energy sector).

4.
Meeting the conditions for debt relief
under the Enhanced HIPC Initiative and the
Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI)
would cut external debt in half (in nominal
terms). MDRI relief would cover the full stock of
debt owed to three multilateral creditors (IDA,
IMF, and the African Development Fund (AfDF))

Text Table 1’s end-2010 external public debt stocks are estimated by staff based on World Bank Debt Reporting System (DRS)
end-2009 debt stock, Chad’s debt management office’s estimates of 2010 disbursements and amortization, and Ministry of
Economy and Planning estimates of 2010 project loan disbursements. The official external debt stock data underestimate the actual
level of external debt. Most notably, the debt registry does not capture the loan from Libya or the loan from China for the state’s
stake in the joint-venture refinery. Also, project loan disbursements are recognized only after a long lag. Both text tables have
discrepancies with corresponding fiscal or balance of payments flow estimates, giving rise to residuals in the sustainability analyses.
Data could be substantially revised in the 2012 DSA.

that remains after Enhanced HIPC relief on
disbursements before end-2004 in the case of
IMF and AfDF, and before end-2003 in the case of
IDA. In nominal terms, this could total over
$1 billion and would imply a reduction in debt
service of about $40 million per year, for about
30 years.
Recent Developments in Public Domestic
Debt
5.
The stock of public domestic debt has
grown, mainly as a result of drawing on

central bank statutory advances. Chad’s
domestic debt is estimated at about
CFAF 87 billion (7½ percent of GDP) at end-2010
(Text Table 2). The public domestic debt includes
central bank statutory advances (avances
statutaires); treasury arrears (arriérés comptables);
rescheduled debt (dettes conventionnées); legal
payment obligations (engagements juridiques);
and one small public bond issue. The authorities
made a significant effort to reduce domestic
arrears in 2010. Most of domestic arrears
outstanding at end-2009 were paid, which
brought down the stock outstanding to about

a sale of over CFAF 100 billion of five-year savings
bonds with a 6 percent coupon. Sixty three
percent of the issue was purchased by Chadian
residents. Two-thirds (67 percent) of the issue was
purchased by banks, local and regional.

Debt Burden Thresholds under the Debt
Sustainability Framework
6.
Chad is a weak policy performer for
the purpose of debt burden thresholds under
the Debt Sustainability Framework (DSF).
Chad’s rating on the World Bank’s Country Policy
and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) is weak
(2.46 on average for 2008–10, on a scale from
1 to 6) and declined from 2.88 in 2005 to 2.38 in
2010.

CHAD 2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

DSA BASELINE SCENARIO
7.
Chad’s external debt ratio in current
value terms deteriorated in 2010 by less than
expected, due to higher-than-expected GDP
growth and lower-than-expected recourse to
external borrowing. Real GDP growth reached
13 percent and higher oil prices strengthened
exports and government revenues. The non-oil
primary deficit in 2010, at 31 percent of non-oil
GDP, was larger than in 2009 and exceeded the
2010 supplementary budget target by nearly
3 points of non-oil GDP. However, higher-thanexpected oil revenues led to a smaller-thanexpected overall deficit. In the event, the
authorities drew only two-thirds of the
$300 million nonconcessional budget support
loan from Libyan Foreign Bank.
8.
The central feature of Chad’s mediumand long-term macroeconomic outlook
remains the steady decline of oil production
over the twenty-year projection period.
Production at the Doba oil field started in 2003,
reached its peak of 61 million barrels in 2004, with
annual output set to decline steadily to a
negligible level beyond 2030. Long-term oil
export projections are based on this gradual
depletion of the Doba field. Chad’s oil trades
below the international reference price, reflecting
a quality discount and transport cost. For the
medium term (to 2016) the price of Chadian oil is
assumed to drop from $99.8 per barrel (all
discounts included) to about $92 per barrel in
2015–16, in line with the trend projected in the
IMF’s World Economic Outlook (WEO) average oil
price; from 2017 onward, the price is assumed to
increase 3 percent per year in U.S. dollar terms

(consistent with the assumption used by the IMF
in long-term projections for other sub-Saharan
African countries). Production has begun at a
second oil field, Bongor, which is only one-third
the size of the Doba oil field. Bongor produces
crude oil at a rate of 20,000 barrels per day;
however its output is not for export, but feedstock
for the oil refinery, the output of which is
projected to reduce Chad’s imports of refined
petroleum products.
9.
The baseline scenario assumes a fiscal
adjustment to offset the decline in oil
revenues. Dwindling oil revenues will cause a
steady decline of total government revenue from
44 percent of non-oil GDP in 2011 to 24 percent
in 2030. The adjustment (resulting in a steady
reduction of non-oil primary deficit to about
5 percent in 2030) is assumed to be achieved by
increased non-oil revenue effort, reduction and
subsequent stabilization of investment outlays at
about 14 percent of non-oil GDP, and cuts in
recurrent spending, notably exceptional security
transfers and transfers to cover losses of
state-owned enterprises.
10.
The authorities recognize the
downward sloping profile of oil revenues and
see the need for fiscal adjustment. Their draft
medium-term fiscal framework (through 2014)
features a similar degree of fiscal adjustment as
the baseline scenario, but a significantly better
end-2011 fiscal position, higher oil revenues, and
a strong improvement in non-oil revenues, all of
which enable a higher level of
domestically-financed investment.

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS CHAD

Box 1. Baseline Macroeconomic Assumptions (2011–30)
The primary determinant of real GDP growth in the baseline scenario is the steady decline of annual oil
production over the next twenty years. Non-oil GDP growth is projected to increase in the short term, as major
projects come on line (see below), and is assumed to stabilize at 3.7 percent in the long term, with the help of a
sustained level of domestic public investment and private investment in the non-oil sector.
Inflation stabilizes at a level consistent with the CEMAC convergence criterion of maximum 3 percent per year.
The external current account remains in significant deficit until the new pipeline and refinery (Chad-China
joint-venture) are completed (they are expected to operate for a full year in 2012), at which time
construction-related and refined petroleum product imports drop significantly. Similarly, strong FDI, associated
with the refinery and other investment projects (power station and cement factory), slows upon their completion in
2012.
The fiscal outlook is dominated by dwindling oil revenues and limited financing options. The authorities adjust by
increasing non-oil revenue effort, eliminating exceptional security spending and subsidies to public enterprises,
while maintaining an appropriately high level of investment and social spending to ensure steady growth in
non-oil economy and poverty reduction.
The external financing assumptions are based on historical averages; 5 percent of non-oil GDP, 70 percent grants
and 30 percent in loans from official multilateral and bilateral creditors. The average grant element of borrowing
declines over time, as the mix of terms changes with diminishing reliance on IDA-type loans. In the absence of an
IMF arrangement, there is no target date for the HIPC completion point, and the baseline does not take into
account HIPC and MDRI debt relief for which Chad is eligible.
The domestic financing assumptions include reimbursement of BEAC statutory advances by 2014 (as scheduled),
no accrual of domestic arrears, and issuance of domestic debt instruments (with an average maturity of one year),
the stock of which reaches about 11 percent of GDP by 2030.

CHAD 2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

EXTERNAL DEBT
Baseline
11.
The evolution of external debt is
driven by the volume of project loans (Box 1).
Going forward, new borrowing is expected to
comprise funding from IDA, AfDB, other
multilateral lenders, Paris Club and non-Paris Club
lenders.3 Absent a substantial improvement in
macroeconomic and public financial management
performance, traditional donors (multilaterals and
Paris Club) are expected to continue to provide
concessional project loans at roughly the same
nominal level as in the last few years, with an
increasing share of project lending by non-Paris
Club bilateral creditors. The concessionality of
borrowing is projected to decline steadily over the
20-year horizon (Figure 1a).
12.
Under the baseline scenario, the
present value of external public- and
publicly-guaranteed debt remains well below
the 30 percent of GDP threshold, declining
steadily from 22 percent to 12 percent in 2030
(Figure 1b). With the expected steady decline in
oil exports over the projection period, both debt
stock and debt service rise steadily relative to
exports, but remain well below their respective
thresholds (Figures 1c and 1e). Relative to
government revenue, the debt stock and debt
service rise from 2011 to 2015–16, when
amortization of the nonconcessional loans
disbursed in 2010 and 2011 begins. Again, the
baseline remains well below the respective
thresholds (Figures 1d and 1f).

3

The terms of IDA, AfDB and other multilateral loans are
concessional, with grant elements ranging from 35 percent to
52 percent.

Alternative Scenarios and Stress Tests
13.
A continuation of current policies
would quickly bring the external public- and
publicly-guaranteed (PPG) debt burden above
the thresholds. If the authorities were to continue
to run a current account deficit far higher than the
foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows in the oil
sector, as they did in 2009, external PPG debt
would breach two of the five of the sustainability
thresholds (Historical scenario in ,Figures 1b, 1c,
1d and 1e; and Alternative Scenario A1 in
Table 2a).
14.
Chad’s external debt burden indicators
are highly sensitive to an oil price shock. Across
all indicative debt burden thresholds, the most
extreme shock is a drop in export growth in
2011—12 proportional to a two-standarddeviation lower oil price (Most extreme shock in
Figure 1 and B2 Bound Test in Table 2a). Such a
shock would send the debt on a path that would
breach all indicative debt burden thresholds.
15.
Nonconcessional borrowing for
contemplated major capital projects would
increase the risk of debt distress. The
authorities have signed letters of intent with
Chinese companies for construction of a new
airport (estimated cost $1 billion) and an
East-West railroad ($7.5 billion). If the projects
were undertaken over and above the baseline
level of spending, executed and financed over
10 years, and did not significantly accelerate
growth, the debt path would breach the
30 percent of GDP threshold in 2015 and peak in
2023, implying an increased risk of debt distress.4
4

These projects are tentative, and therefore not in the
baseline. Also, their impact and cost-effectiveness relative to
alternative investment projects has not been established; no
growth impact is assumed.

PUBLIC DEBT
Baseline
16.
The inclusion of domestic debt does
not alter the assessment of Chad’s debt
sustainability. Given the size of Chad’s domestic
debt, the baseline adjustment in the non-oil
primary balance, and expected oil revenues, the
public debt sustainability analysis broadly parallels
the external debt sustainability analysis. The
domestic debt component increases from
7½ percent of GDP in 2010 to 11¼ percent of
GDP in 2030, reflecting the increased reliance on
domestic debt financing.

demonstrate leadership in the development of a
regional financial market. The authorities are
eager to proceed, as soon as technically feasible,
to issue instruments with maturities shorter than
one year.5
Alternative Scenarios and Stress Tests
18.
The analysis of total public debt
sustainability confirms that the recent (2010)
fiscal stance is not sustainable. Even with ample
oil revenues, and assuming that financing could

CHAD 2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

be secured, the resulting debt path would
increase steeply, leading to an unmanageable
debt and debt-service burden (Fixed Primary
Balance Scenario in Figure 2). A temporary shock

to real GDP growth in 2011–12 would also impair
public debt sustainability (Most Extreme Shock in
Figure 2 and Bound Test B1 in Table 2b).

THE AUTHORITIES’ VIEWS
19.
The authorities have expressed
renewed determination to resume the path to
debt relief. They urged staffs to recognize Chad’s
special post-conflict circumstances and recent
progress, and to accelerate the remaining steps
toward completion point. The authorities
welcome closer collaboration with staffs in
designing their long-term growth strategy,

including a framework for managing major capital
projects and related financing. That said, the
authorities continue to emphasize that public
investment is critical to growth, and that debt
relief is needed to create fiscal space for
additional development spending (including
foreign-financed).

DEBT DISTRESS CLASSIFICATION AND CONCLUSIONS
20.
It is staffs’ view that, based on external
debt burden indicators, Chad’s risk of debt
distress is moderate. The public DSA suggests
that under the baseline scenario Chad’s overall
public sector debt dynamics are sustainable, in
light of the current size, and expected evolution,
of the domestic debt stock. This year’s DSA yields
roughly the same debt dynamics under the
baseline scenario and sensitivity to shocks as last
year’s, but stress test results remain a source of
concern.
21.
Progress toward the HIPC completion
point would substantially reduce Chad’s debt
vulnerabilities, as HIPC Initiative and MDRI debt
relief would cut external debt in half. Staffs are
supportive of the authorities’ expressed

determination to return to the path to debt relief,
including successfully implementing an
IMF-supported program. In this context, staffs
continue to emphasize the need for stronger
public financial management and a more prudent
fiscal policy, both to minimize the risk of debt
distress directly and as a basis for an
IMF-supported program. The staffs urged the
authorities to subject major public investment
proposals to careful, independent evaluation, and
to avoid nonconcessional borrowing. Better
coordination of Chadian agencies, to collect and
disseminate comprehensive, timely and reliable
debt statistics, would facilitate the conduct of
sustainability analysis.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
September 7, 2011
This statement summarizes information that has become available since the issuance of the
staff report (SM/11/209). The new information does not change the thrust of the staff
appraisal.
President Déby was sworn in for his fifth term in early August. Subsequent cabinet changes
affected key economic ministries of finance and budget, and infrastructure.
Fiscal performance through June was broadly as staff anticipated at the time of the Article IV
mission. It was marked by a shortfall in non-oil revenue, higher-than-expected oil revenues,
and pressures on security-related expenditure. Almost the full year’s worth of security
spending was executed, while spending on health, education, and other social priorities has
lagged. The non-oil primary deficit (NOPD) for the first half of 2011 exceeded the implied
mid-year budget baseline by about 2 percentage points of non-oil GDP. The estimated overall
fiscal position was a surplus of about 3.2 percent of non-oil GDP.
Developments in the domestic petroleum market, following the opening of the first Chadian
oil refinery, raised a new policy concern. Setting petroleum product prices below the
prevailing market level disrupted imports and caused shortages in the local market. The
foreign partner in the joint venture refinery has expressed concern about its financial
viability. The new petroleum price policy, which is due to expire in September, is currently
under review. Staff has offered to provide the authorities with technical assistance on
petroleum product pricing and taxation.
The authorities are concerned about the impact of the prolonged conflict in Libya. The
associated disruption of trade contributed to a revenue shortfall, while the security tensions
and the humanitarian crisis entail additional outlays. Half a million people, according to the
authorities, await repatriation to or via Chad. Also, two Chadian banks with significant
Libyan ownership have suffered an outflow of deposits and may require public sector
support.
The authorities indicated that these concerns would need to be reflected in a supplementary
budget, the details of which are not yet known. Staff stand ready to work with the authorities
to ensure that humanitarian needs are met while safeguarding fiscal sustainability.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
October 12, 2011

International Monetary Fund

Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2011 Article IV Consultation with Chad
On September 7, 2011, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Chad.1
Background
Chad’s internal security situation has improved since last year’s Article IV consultations, but the
crisis in Libya poses risks. Over 70,000 people fleeing violence have been repatriated to or via
Chad, with the help of international agencies. The domestic political situation is relatively calm,
with legislative and presidential elections having passed without serious disruption, but
opposition leaders boycotted the elections and alleged fraud. To accelerate non-oil growth and
stem the impact of dwindling oil reserves on income, exports, and fiscal revenues, the
government has been pursuing an ambitious public investment program and welcomed foreign
direct investment in industrial projects.
With real GDP growth reaching 13 percent in 2010, Chad recovered strongly from the 2009
downturn. Oil production increased, as high oil prices justified additional investment to bolster
extraction rates. With favorable rains and government measures to provide agricultural inputs,
as well as increased cultivated area, agricultural production nearly doubled and food and
consumer prices declined. Notwithstanding the increased export earnings from oil, the external
current account deficit widened to 35 percent of GDP, because of the high import content of
investment spending (notably, in the oil sector).

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
Despite some improvements, serious deficiencies in budget execution persisted. The share of
spending executed with emergency procedures (“depense avant ordonnancement” – DAO) was
lower in 2010 than in 2009, but still accounted for over one quarter of domestically financed
discretionary spending (9.3 percent of non-oil GDP) and DAOs equivalent to 4.3 percent of nonoil GDP awaited regularization at end-2010. On the positive side, the share of contracts
awarded without competitive tender fell from 85 percent in 2009 to 49 percent in 2010.
The overall fiscal position improved in 2010, reflecting higher than projected oil prices and
increased non-oil tax revenue, but the underlying fiscal stance, as measured by the non-oil
primary deficit (NOPD), weakened from 28 percent to 31 percent of non-oil GDP. The NOPD
target established in the 2010 supplementary budget was overshot by 2½ percent of non-oil
GDP, mainly due to domestically-financed public investment. The level of official reserves
increased, but their ratio in months of imports of goods and services (excluding oil-sector
imports) weakened somewhat. Chad’s real effective exchange rate remained broadly in line with
that of other CEMAC (Central African Economic and Monetary Community) countries. Broad
money increased by 25 percent, in line with nominal GDP, while credit to the economy grew 19
percent, roughly in line with nominal non-oil GDP.
Chad’s public finances and financial sector are overexposed to oil risk. Since the beginning of
the oil era in 2003, Chad has pursued an expansionary and procyclical fiscal policy, straining
the absorptive capacity of the economy and the public financial management capacity of the
administration. Without a financial cushion in the form of government deposits, a shock like the
one experienced in 2009 would imply a forced fiscal tightening, a significant investment
slowdown, and increased domestic arrears, possibly including arrears to the central bank. In
turn, government suppliers may be unable to service their debts, and, commercial banks’
nonperforming loans would rise. Although higher oil prices have relaxed short-term financing
constraint, better public financial management and budgetary discipline are needed to make
efficient use of finite oil resources.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that higher-than-expected oil prices in 2010 had contributed to
improving Chad’s overall fiscal and external balances, while a rebound in agriculture boosted
real GDP growth to 13 percent. Directors commended the authorities for the appropriate
measures undertaken in response to last year’s food shortages. With these measures and
favorable rains, agricultural production nearly doubled and food prices declined, cushioning
Chad from the impact of rising international food prices.
Directors welcomed the opening of Chad’s first oil refinery, but expressed concern that setting
fuel prices below the prevailing market level had disrupted imports and caused shortages.
Noting the merits of mitigating the adverse impact of high fuel prices on the most vulnerable
segments of the population, Directors cautioned that such measures should be efficient,
targeted, and fiscally affordable.

3
While agreeing that higher-than-expected oil prices contributed to relaxing the financing
constraint in the short term, Directors noted that oil price volatility and the projected mediumterm decline in oil production warrant building a savings buffer, to smooth public spending,
ensure adequate resources for poverty-reduction programs, and preserve debt sustainability. In
this context, Directors welcomed the authorities’ plan to increase efforts to mobilize non-oil
revenue, and to reduce the non-oil primary deficit to a sustainable position over the medium
term.
Directors urged the authorities to improve the quality of infrastructure spending through better
project selection and implementation, and by adjusting the public investment budget to the
absorptive capacity of the economy. In view of the past record of optimistic revenue forecasts,
Directors deemed it prudent to make a portion of the public investment program contingent on
the realization of revenue plans, and encouraged the authorities to pursue a prudent
nonconcessional borrowing policy.
Directors also underscored the need to promote non-oil growth and diversification in the
medium term. They noted the institutional weaknesses behind the difficult business climate, in
general, and financial sector vulnerabilities and underdevelopment, in particular. They
encouraged the authorities to implement structural reforms that would facilitate private
investment and further develop financial markets, notably by streamlining regulatory processes,
simplifying the business tax system, reforming key state-owned enterprises, and enhancing
confidence in the judicial system. Directors encouraged the authorities to work with other
CEMAC members to strengthen the regional bank supervisor’s bank resolution powers.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ renewed interest in a staff-monitored program (SMP), which
could pave the way to a financial arrangement under the Extended Credit Facility and to the
completion point under the Enhanced Initiative for Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC).
Directors stressed that progress on fiscal policy and public financial management would be key
to reaching agreement on, and successful performance under, an SMP.
To this effect, Directors encouraged the authorities to continue their efforts to improve the
quality and timeliness of economic and financial data.

Mr. Assimaidou, Executive Director for Chad
and Mr. Yambaye, Alternate Executive
Director, September 7, 2011
Our Chadian authorities remain committed to pursuing a close collaboration with the Fund.
They appreciate the candid dialogue they have had with Fund staff in March, April and June
of this year, and continue to count on Fund policy advice in implementing their economic
agenda. While policy implementation has improved in recent years, they recognize that much
progress remains to be done.
On the domestic front, Chad continues to face significant infrastructure gaps (electricity,
roads, agricultural capacities, etc.). The authorities intend to meet the country’s infrastructure
needs gradually. However, strengthening capacities, notably putting in place a project
management system would help improve both public expenditure and the quality of
infrastructure. In this regard, the authorities are eager to receiving technical assistance from
partners, notably the Fund. The authorities have committed to build on the steps already
taken in 2010 and 2011 in strengthening budget discipline to make further inroads into
improving public financial management.
The challenging external environment, marked by conflicts in three neighboring countries
and lower external demand, coupled with daunting capacity constraints have contributed to
spending overruns to meet security and humanitarian needs. However, the current high oil
prices and good agricultural production have helped to mitigate to a certain extent the
adverse financial impact. Chad’s economy and external debt remain vulnerable to a reversal
of oil prices while output is sensible to bad weather conditions and other exogenous shocks.
In their endeavor to tackle these vulnerabilities, the Chadian authorities greatly value Fund
advice, and they seek to resume a Fund-supported program and reach the completion point
under the HIPC Initiative as soon as possible. Debt alleviation would also help free up
resources to tackle poverty.
Following presidential and parliamentary elections, President Deby who has been re-elected
appointed a new cabinet comprising a new economic team, with the view to giving a new
momentum to the policy and reform agenda. The government is committed to working
closely with the development partners, notably the Fund, to raise the growth rate, reduce
vulnerabilities to the economy and alleviate poverty.
I. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND PROSPECTS
The rebound experienced by the Chadian economy since the 2010 Article IV consultations
contributed to strengthening the overall fiscal position thanks to higher-than-expected oil
prices but also greater non-oil tax revenue. On spending, while weaknesses in budget
execution continued, there has been encouraging progress: the share of spending executed
with emergency procedures (DAOs—dépenses avant ordonnancement) decreased in 2010

2
and the first few months of 2011; majority of contracts are now awarded in a competitive
tender; and budget execution improved further in 2011.
The Chadian authorities would like to underscore that the low execution of health and
education spending is in large part due to weak capacities in budget commitments in the
corresponding ministries as well as seasonal factors that push most of those commitments
towards year-end. The authorities confirmed that health and education are top priorities in
their development and poverty reduction strategy.
Regarding the debt situation, while the stock of public and publicly-guaranteed debt has risen
slightly to 32.5 percent of GDP at end-2010 from 30.5 percent a year earlier, the authorities’
debt policy has remained broadly prudent. The updated DSA shows that the risk of debt
distress remains moderate.
Monetary aggregates remain under control, with broad money growth in line with nominal
GDP and credit to the economy raising in line with nominal non-oil GDP.
Looking ahead, the expected slight decline in oil production, combined with slower
agricultural growth will contribute to moderating overall GDP growth at end-2011.
Nevertheless, growth will accelerate again in 2012 partly owing to the entry into operation of
the new oil refinery, new industrial projects, notably in the power and cement areas. Inflation
will remain subdued in 2011 and 2012 in spite of demand pressures from public investment
and wages.
II. CHALLENGES GOING FORWARD
Going forward, the authorities will build on recent progress to further improve the security
situation. They also strive to respond to the spending pressures caused by other short-term
priority outlays and more generally address the problem of budget discipline. They also
intend to put in place a medium-term strategy to ensure fiscal sustainability. Finally,
sustaining growth through both oil and non-oil activity is a key objective in Chad’s
development strategy.
Reducing security-related uncertainties
The authorities are of the view that further progress in reducing security problems—often
stemming from conflicts in neighboring countries—is instrumental to improving economic
conditions in Chad. They stand ready to meet these needs, which can be significant, and
expect that the improvement in the security situation would boost non-oil economic activity
and non-oil revenue, and ultimately allow a decline in security spending.
Coping with spending pressures and improving budget discipline
Our authorities share the view that coping with spending pressures and improving budget
discipline will require reforms to strengthen public financial management, including
expenditure controls. They are committed to bring back as early as end-2011 the non-oil
primary deficit to the level implied by 2011 budget. The intended supplementary budget

3
which is being reflected on will contain the necessary measures to meet this commitment
while regularizing the extra-budgetary spending incurred in the first half of 2011.
Building on the progress already made, project contracts will follow strictly the procurement
rules, and all investment spending for the rest of 2011 will be executed through the regular
budget process.
The Chadian government welcomes any technical assistance from donors that would help
them design the required multi-year investment framework and improve public financial
management.
Ensuring medium-term fiscal sustainability
The authorities welcome and agree with Fund staff’s advice to put in place a medium-term
fiscal strategy, which includes a greater control of the investment program, efforts to
strengthen non-oil revenue and measures to better manage oil revenue to cushion the budget
against a significant oil price reversal. Their intended medium-term fiscal framework is
broadly in line with Fund staff’s.
As indicated above, procurement procedures will be followed through, and public investment
better controlled to take into account the country’s limited absorptive capacity.
Efforts to improve non-oil revenue will be made through reforms in tax and customs
administration. Already, customs revenue is rising owing to the new customs data and
payments processing system. Other measures would include curbing tax and customs
exemptions.
Sustaining growth
The Chadian authorities are fully aware that sustaining growth is predicated on efforts to
deepen the financial sector and make progress on improving the business environment with
the view to promote private sector development.
My authorities are cognizant of the financial sector vulnerabilities, notably the lack of
financial depth, the fragile situation of some banks, and the underdeveloped regional
financial markets. To address the problem of distressed banks, they will continue to work
with other CEMAC members to strengthen cooperation with the regional banking
supervisory body, COBAC, improve its capacity and independence, and tackle bank solvency
problems.
Regarding financial sector development, the authorities have begun with the issuance of
CFAF 100 billion, -five-year bonds carrying a 6 percent coupon. This operation has been
encouraging as two-thirds of the issue was purchased by Chadian residents.
The authorities recognize that there is considerable room for improving the country’s
business climate. Apart from efforts to enhance security and improve the soundness and
functioning of the financial sector, they view the strengthening of the judiciary system and
the resolution of the problems facing the energy and cotton sectors as essential for enhancing
the business environment and alleviating the fiscal burden of those sectors. Furthermore, they

4
broadly agreed with Fund staff-proposed tax reforms, notably measures to reduce the
corporate tax burden and harmonize it at the CEMAC level, and eliminate special
administrative levies. These two actions are intended to be decided upon in the short term.
III. CONCLUSION
Following several difficult years marked by conflicts in the region, the situation in Chad has
greatly improved since peace was restored, enabling the authorities to implement important
economic measures which are helping the country to move towards macroeconomic
sustainability. In this regard, our authorities highly appreciate the advice of the staff, and they
have already started to implement many of the reform and policy measures recommended.
Progress is being achieved, and it is the Chadian authorities’ intention to build on this
progress and start implementing a medium term economic program that can receive Fund
support under the ECF and enable Chad to reach the Completion Point under the Enhanced
HIPC Initiative. Board support towards this objective will be highly appreciated.
