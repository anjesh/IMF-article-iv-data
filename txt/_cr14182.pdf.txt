STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
June 17, 2014

KEY ISSUES
Context and Outlook. The economy has shown resilience through the crisis, but faces a
slow recovery. Three years of significant fiscal adjustment have dampened activity. We
project growth of 0.7 percent this year and 1.4 percent in 2015, driven by stronger
external demand, improvements in profitability and investment, and a lesser fiscal drag.
Inflation is projected to stay just above one percent. Apart from cyclical weakness and a
structural fiscal imbalance, the economy faces employment and competitiveness gaps.
Supply side measures and structural reforms are expected to improve economic
performance over the medium term.
Risks. Volatile and uneven leading indicators point to the risk of a stalled recovery.
Continued stagnation would, in turn, make it more difficult to meet fiscal objectives.
Financial stability risks, and related outward spillovers, have abated considerably, as
banks have rebuilt capital and liquidity buffers at a brisk pace, although exposure to
wholesale funding remains high.
Policy Recommendations. Despite substantial adjustment, mostly on the tax side, the
government deficit still stood at 4.2 percent of GDP in 2013, and debt rose to 92 percent
in 2013. The April 2014 Stability Program lays out a path of fiscal adjustment, tax cuts
and reform aimed at closing the structural fiscal deficit over the medium term while
boosting the economy’s growth potential. The targeted pace of adjustment is right—
about ½ a percentage point a year. The simultaneous pursuit of tax cuts and deficit
reduction rests on an ambitious program of expenditure reduction (2.2 percent of GDP).
The emphasis should go to structural measures to ensure that spending growth is
curbed permanently. Tax cuts and regulatory simplification are welcome measures to
encourage investment. The impact of supply-side initiatives would be boosted by better
functioning labor and product markets: reforms should aim to expand competition in
services and to deepen labor market reforms with a view to creating more room for
enterprise-level negotiations over working conditions. Indexation of the minimum wage
should be reformed to limit the adverse impact on low skilled employment. Stronger
liquidity and capital buffers in banks, and an improved European bank resolution
framework, will better shield the economy and public finances from banking shocks.
Banks still face adaptation to the evolving regulatory framework, and it will be important
to ensure that the uneven taxation of financial instruments does not constrain the key
intermediation role of banks.

CONTEXT
1.
The mission took place before the European Parliament elections, in which the farright party registered large gains at the expense of the socialist and center right parties. These
electoral results came in the wake of a similar rebuke at the local elections in April, following which
the President nominated a new government, headed by PM Valls. Discussions with the authorities
centered on the policy program of the new government, as described in the Stability Program and
National Reform Program. European Parliament elections have no immediate implications for
policies: the government can count on a comfortable socialist majority in parliament until
Presidential and Parliamentary elections in 2017; and, in reaction to the electoral results, both the
President and the PM vowed to stay the course. Nonetheless, the popular discontent voiced during
these elections could make the reform and adjustment process more arduous.
2.
Through the crisis, the economy fared better than other large euro area economies,
except Germany, but it is also behind others in the recovery cycle (Figures 1 and 2). Investment
in particular remains depressed and the output gap widened to -2.2 percent in 2013, with
unemployment stuck above 10 percent. Demand has been constrained by a weak external
environment and the drag caused by structural fiscal adjustment of nearly 3 percent of GDP over
three years (2011–13). Resilient wage growth helped sustain consumption; but, combined with
faltering productivity growth, it also compressed profit margins. Falling profitability, in turn, appears
to have amplified the contraction of investment in response to flagging demand. 1 Long-standing
structural and competitiveness problems have compounded these negative factors.
3.
Private consumption has been an important factor of resilience in the French
economy. During the crisis, the private saving rate did not react as procyclically as in other
economies (notably the United States and the United Kingdom), and consumption growth remained
positive, except for a small dip in 2012—real consumption was 2.5 percent higher in 2013 than at
the pre-crisis peak, and the household saving rate has been relatively stable around 15½ percent in
the last decade. The stability of consumption, even as disposable incomes were squeezed by rising
taxation, reflects extensive social safety nets and sustained real wage growth.
4.
The stability of private consumption also reflects weak exposure to asset price
changes. The absence of observable wealth effects in consumption, which have amplified the
recession in other advanced economies, owes to conservative financial holdings (mostly bank
deposits and life insurance products which have built-in shock absorbers) and inability to monetize
real estate wealth because of rigid lending standards—these are based on capacity to repay rather
than collateral. Thus, in the absence of over-leveraging, the gradual correction of real estate prices
which is underway—real prices are 9 percent below pre-crisis peak—has had no discernible impact
on consumption.

5.
In the wake of disinflationary pressures that began in 2012, inflation has stabilized
around 1 percent. The slowdown in inflation (from 2.3 percent in 2012Q2 to 0.9 percent in 2014Q1)
originates from declining core, energy, and food inflation in about equal proportions (Figure 3). Core
inflation bottomed out mid–2013 driven by the continued compression in profit margins, pass
through of lower import prices into manufacturing products, and the significant drop of telecom
prices following the entry of a fourth operator. As some of the temporary factors waned, core
inflation has edged up to just over 1 percent.
6.
Monetary easing has been transmitted into domestic interest rates, but monetary
conditions have tightened since 2012. Despite the low level of nominal lending rates, falling
inflation expectations have led to an increase in real interest rates. Balance sheet restructuring by
banks was achieved mostly by shedding non-core foreign activities while preserving the core
lending business. Domestic credit growth has thus remained positive through much of the crisis,
although in 2013 the only growth was in mortgage lending. Corporate and household debt levels
have increased, but they remain moderate by international comparison (Figure 4).
Though nominal interest rates have remained broadly

real interest rates have risen as inflation has come down.

7.
Notwithstanding the significant adjustment already achieved, the government deficit
was still 4.2 percent of GDP in 2013 (2.8 percent in structural terms). The persistence of
structural fiscal deficits stems from the fact that public expenditure has tended to outrun GDP
growth over decades, including through the fiscal stimulus of 2009. The resulting accumulation of
deficits since 1975, even in good times, has reduced fiscal space and limited the ability of
governments to sustain demand as the economy slowed down in 2012-13 (Figure 5). 2 Fiscal space is
also constrained by contingent liabilities, which declined from 152 percent of GDP end 2012 to
2

As the structural deficit in 2012-13 diverged significantly from the multi-year fiscal law of 2012, the fiscal council
triggered the corrective mechanism in May 2014 (for details see Box 1 of the Staff Report for the 2013 Article IV
Consultation, Country Report No. 13/251). In response, the government said it will take additional spending
measures (0.2 percent of GDP) this summer; and it will likely send to Parliament, in the fall, a new multi-year fiscal law
targeting structural balance in 2017 rather than in 2016 (consistent with the April 2014 stability program).

134 percent of GDP in 2013 (slightly more than half is related to pensions). Despite the increase in
debt, government borrowing rates have stabilized at historically low levels (the 10-year yield has
declined from 4.7 percent in June 2008 to less than 1.9 percent in May 2014).
8.
The fiscal policy strategy was to divide the adjustment equally between revenue and
expenditure measures but to front-load the revenue measures because of their lower
(expected) multiplier. The tax burden increased by 2.8 percent of GDP from 2007 to 2013. Fiscal
adjustment shifted from tax increases to expenditure containment in 2013, but growth of spending
was still 0.9 percent in real terms. The strategy has encountered a number of challenges, including a
political backlash against taxation, falling tax buoyancy and inflation, expenditure slippages at the
level of local governments, and rising social spending. In the event, the social insurance system
which has contributed to the economy’s resilience has become more difficult to sustain financially
and to reconcile with deficit reduction.
9.
Loss of competitiveness has weighed on growth. The competitiveness gap is evident from
export market share and unit labor cost developments (Figure 6). The evidence based on price
competitiveness is less clear, because narrowing profit margins have compensated for the loss of
cost competitiveness. At the same time, EBA model estimates suggest that the 2013 current account
was 1 to 3 percent of GDP below its cyclically-adjusted norm. Based on all of these considerations,
staff considers that the real exchange rate in 2013 was 5-10 percent higher (i.e., overvalued) relative
to medium term fundamentals and desirable policy settings. Export performance appears weak even
when correcting for the fact that France is less integrated in the Global Value Chains, which tend to
gross up both imports and exports.3 Non-cost factors weighing on competitiveness are related to
rigidities in the economy. The recent narrowing of the current account deficit—from 2.1 percent of
GDP in 2012 to 1.3 percent in 2013—reflects to a greater extent weak domestic demand than a
rebound of export growth. The net international investment position has deteriorated since the
outset of the crisis to -20 percent of GDP. However, its size and trajectory do not raise sustainability
concerns.
10.
Financial sector indicators show continued improvements, but banks remain exposed
to wholesale funding risks. Banks have made significant progress in building capital and liquidity
buffers, drawing from increased profitability and adjustments in their funding structure. These
improvements have been reflected in rising price-to-book ratios (Figure 7). Despite a further
reduction in the loan-to-deposit ratio (to 115.9 percent in 2013 for the six large banking groups),
banks face gaps relative to future net stable funding ratio requirements. And, although the large
groups have met the CRD-IV fully loaded minimum CET1 capital requirement, many peers have
gone further. Deleveraging has continued, with total assets of the five large banking groups down
7.5 percent in 2013. Non-performing loans have risen to 4.5 percent in 2013 (Table 5), but continue
to be well provisioned.

The growth of real per capita income in France prior to the
crisis was driven essentially by labor productivity growth,
with virtually no contribution from increase in the
employment rate. This contrasts with the observed
increases of the employment rates in peer countries.

Since the outset of the crisis, the loss of real per capita
income in France reflects both rising dependency rates and
falling employment rates, although to a lesser extent than
in peer countries (with the exception of Germany).

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
11.
The recovery faces a difficult take off. On the back of a weaker than expected first
quarter, staff revised growth projections relative to the April WEO, to 0.7 percent in 2014 and
1.4 percent in 2015. The expected gradual recovery rests on stronger external and domestic private
demand (from gains in real disposable income and gradual improvements in profit margins), and a
lesser fiscal drag. Supply side measures are expected to gain in strength over the medium term.
Following 2 years of net job destruction, the private sector should become a source of net job
creation this year, but the unemployment rate should begin to come down measurably only in 2016.
12.
Inflation is expected to remain around 1 percent, rising only very gradually over the
medium term. The inflation projection is predicated on moderate wage inflation related to the slack
in the labor market and the need of enterprises to restore profit margins. However, there are nonnegligible downside risks to the inflation outlook. While so far wage growth has declined very slowly
in response to labor market slack, it could decelerate more rapidly in a context of continued slow
output growth. In particular, downward pressures could develop as falling inflation feeds into wages
through the indexation of the minimum wage.
13.
The 2014 budget was prepared on the basis of prudent macroeconomic assumptions,
reflecting the moderating role of the fiscal council. The authorities project a deficit of 3.8 percent
of GDP based on additional saving measures to be adopted this summer. Staff projects a deficit of
4.0 percent reflecting the downward revision to growth and lower tax buoyancy. Structural
adjustment would be 0.4 percent of GDP, the bulk of it coming from expenditure containment.
14.
The authorities’ medium-term scenario envisages a somewhat stronger and faster
response of the economy to supply side measures. The Stability Program, prepared prior to the
release of the poor Q1 results, envisaged growth of 1 percent this year and 1.7 percent in 2015,
rising to 2.25 percent by 2016. It also assumed higher price and wage inflation and a more rapid
decline of the unemployment rate. The newly created fiscal council assessed the growth and
employment projections to be realistic for 2014, possible but subject to the “realization of several
positive assumptions” in 2015, and optimistic for 2016-17.
15.
Delivery of planned supply side and fiscal policies should help correct the external
imbalance. In the staff’s baseline scenario, the current account deficit is projected to close over the
medium-term in tandem with the fiscal deficit. This would bring the external position to a level
consistent with fundamentals and desirable policy settings. This adjustment is to be facilitated by
internal depreciation induced by the implementation of the authorities’ policy program of public
expenditure containment and labor tax reductions, and by wage moderation. These policy actions
are aligned with those recommended by staff to close the external gap.
16.
Risks around the baseline scenario remain substantial, reflecting uncertainty about the
timing and strength of the cyclical turnaround and the impact of popular discontent on policy
resolve. Slower global growth and financial market volatility are the main external risks (see Risk

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

FRANCE

Assessment Matrix). The main domestic risk is a stalled recovery of investment in the face of an
uncertain outlook—some leading indicators remain below average. A negative spiral of low growth
and falling inflation, and its effect on real interest rates, would have additional adverse effects on
investment and the fiscal deficit. Lower-than-expected growth could also fuel popular discontent
and could undermine fiscal resolve. However, the fiscal responsibility framework would likely kick in
to limit backtracking on fiscal policy. Public debt is particularly sensitive to a lower growth scenario
(DSA in Appendix II). On the upside, staff could be underestimating the rebound, given the wellknown difficulties in projecting cyclical turnarounds. The main financial sector risks stem from the
banks’ continued reliance on wholesale funding, even though the maturity of debt has been
lengthened; medium-term risks relate to the ability of French banks to adapt to changes in the
regulatory environment (see policy discussion). Legal risks associated with their global operations
(e.g., investigations into market manipulation, compliance with international sanctions) could also
weigh significantly on some banks, particularly if penalties were to curtail some of their international
activities.
17.
The potential for outward spillovers from France appears to have abated since the
crisis, particularly with respect to financial linkages. Recent research shows that, whereas credit
and funding shocks to French banks could have induced banking failures in more than ten countries
in 2008, as of 2012 significant outward spillovers would have been limited to Belgium, Italy, and
Ireland, reflecting lower cross-border exposures.4 Other research shows that, under deteriorated
liquidity conditions, cutbacks in interbank lending were the first line of defense of French banks, and
that banks with higher capital ratios were able to maintain higher rates of lending to the foreign
non-financial sector.5 By implication, the generalized improvement in capital ratios since the crisis
should help limit outward spillovers to the real sector in the event of renewed liquidity stress. With
respect to trade linkages, France continues to exercise strong demand effects especially on small
neighboring countries. A recent study highlights the strong outward spillovers of business
investment in particular, given its large import component.6 In all, with investment set to recover
gradually, and with banks’ capital and liquidity positions strengthened and direct financial interlinkages reduced, large adverse spillovers from France appear less likely.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most
likely to materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment
of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a
probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability of 30 percent or more). The RAM reflects staff views
on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually
exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
18.
A comprehensive policy program to address structural imbalances. Persistent fiscal
deficits have eroded fiscal space to the point where there may not be enough room to counter
effectively possible future shocks without putting fiscal credibility at risk. Underutilization of labor
resources, with an employment rate of youth and seniors among the lowest in the OECD, has not
only lowered potential GDP but also impacted social spending, with adverse effects on the fiscal
balance and taxation. Overlaying these challenges is a competitiveness gap which has further
undermined potential growth. This diagnostic, shared by the authorities, is the motivation behind
the ambitious course of adjustment and reform laid out in the April 2014 Stability Program and
National Reform Program. At the core of the strategy are a very sizeable correction in public
expenditure and measures to increase the supply response of the economy.
19.
Steady and more moderate fiscal adjustment going forward. The Stability Program
targets structural fiscal adjustment averaging about ½ a percent of GDP a year, until (structural)
fiscal balance is reached. Staff and the authorities agreed that this objective adequately balances the
need to restore fiscal space against the risk of undermining the recovery. Staff noted that no
additional measures should be taken this year, beyond those already planned, given the fragility of
the recovery. The authorities project to converge to structural fiscal balance by 2017 (the horizon of
the Stability Program). Under the staff’s more conservative macroeconomic scenario, fiscal
adjustment would need to continue at the same pace until 2019 to reach balance (see staff baseline
scenario in the tables).
20.
Adjustment anchored by an expenditure reduction plan. Because of simultaneous tax
cuts (see below), the strategy relies on sizable expenditure reduction (relative to trend). The
expenditure effort (2.2 percent of GDP over three years) is distributed across all sectors, including
local governments and social security where expenditure growth has been the strongest in recent
years. Expenditure cuts at the local government level will be backed by institutional reforms aimed
at rationalizing overlapping structures which have contributed to overspending. This institutional
reform should begin in the next couple of years. In all, real expenditure would remain roughly
constant over the next three years, compared to growth of 0.5 percent in 2011-14. The areas of
adjustment have been identified, and the underlying measures are in various stages of preparation.
The authorities plan to provide greater clarity on the specific measures in the multi-year finance law
in the fall (Box 1).
21.
Still, sizeable implementation risks ahead. Given the scale of the effort, resistance to
expenditure tightening is likely to build up as specific measures are put up for discussion with social
partners and for parliamentary approval. Staff also noted that institutional reform that will help
contain local government spending will only come into effect over the medium term. In the
meantime, there is a risk that local governments would react to reduced transfers from the central
government by cutting productive investment, raising taxes, or increasing debt. This would
undermine the government’s strategy.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

FRANCE

22.
Careful piloting needed to mitigate these risks. The authorities recognized the difficulty
of piloting this program over the next three years, but emphasized the strong political will behind it,
as reflected in the decision to obtain parliamentary endorsement. With such endorsement, the
authorities believed they could pursue the necessary measures, even if concessions may need to be
Box 1. The Spending Containment Package
Announced expenditure containment of €50 billion, relative to trend, over 2015-17 implies an effort of
2.2 percent of GDP and would result in a stabilization of real spending over the three years. By comparison, the
expenditure effort planned for 2014 is €19 billion (including €4 billion in extra cuts added in supplementary
budgets).
The cuts are frontloaded: €21 billion in 2015, €16 billion in 2016, and €13 billion in 2017. Cumulatively, they
represent about 4 percent of spending for each level of government (central, sub-national, and social security).
The cuts are distributed as follows:

Central government: €18 billion. To be achieved through spending rationalization, pooling of
purchases and ICT spending across ministries, reduced funding of state agencies, and extension of the wage
freeze introduced in 2010 combined with stabilization of the number of civil servants.1 Discussions are under
way on how to distribute the burden across ministries consistent with government priorities.

Local governments: €11 billion cut in transfers from the central government, expected to lead to
equivalent cuts in spending. These cuts follow a freeze in 2012 and a €1.5 billion cut in 2014. Because of their
fiscal independence, local authorities could, within limits, compensate for lower transfers by raising taxes and
debt. 2 To ensure that the cut in transfers will translate in spending reductions, the government has launched
plans to reduce the number of sub-national governments over the medium term. The plan also includes
elimination of the general competency clause which has spurred duplication of spending by allowing the
various layers of government to operate in the same areas of competence.

Health spending: €10 billion. Measures have been largely identified, and they are mostly structural:
development of ambulatory surgery (€1 billion), rationalization and pooling of hospital spending (€1 billion),
cut in medicine costs notably through promotion of generics (€3.5 billion), elimination of ineffective medical
procedures (€2.5 billion). Additional savings would come from the public sector wage freeze and from fighting
fraud.

Social protection: €11 billion. €2.9 billion comes from recent reforms of family allowance and
pensions; €4 billion from de-indexation of pensions, family, and housing allowances—expected to be adopted
in 2014; and €2.8 billion from additional reform of unemployment insurance and family allowances—yet to be
defined. The remaining €1.2 billion in savings would come from reduced administrative costs.
The proposed savings are at different stages of identification. The wage freeze, de-indexation of social
benefits, and impact of recent reforms in social benefits are well identified. Central government savings
(outside of wage and employment freeze) have yet to be announced, but the central government has the
means to deliver. Savings in health spending are identified and rationing mechanisms are in place to ensure
execution, although health spending is subject to factors that fall outside the control of the authorities. Of the
social spending saving, about €4 billion depends on reforms of social protection programs, which will need to
be decided in consultation with social partners, who are ultimately responsible for these programs. As for local
governments, they have the means to realize savings by reducing employment through attrition, and by
containing other current and capital spending. The degree to which there will be leakage into higher taxes or
higher debt is uncertain.
1

The base wage freeze applies to all levels of government.

2

The potential for tax increases is limited by the narrow own tax base (6 percent of GDP). Local governments can only resort
to debt financing for capital projects, so debt could increase only by shifting the financing of such projects from own
resources to debt.

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

FRANCE

made at the margins. As for the effort required of local governments, they noted that it was doable
without disorderly adjustment or leakages into higher taxes or debt, since it only implies a
stabilization of real spending (compared to a reduction of about 1 percent per year for the central
government). Nonetheless, the authorities were seeking to develop coordination mechanisms to
guide and monitor the actions of local governments through the consolidation phase. They also
thought that raising taxes was no longer politically viable for local elected officials.
23.
Supply side measures to reinvigorate investment and job creation. The package of
supply side measures includes: (i) tax cuts for enterprises (2 percent of GDP in 2014–17), comprising
the CICE8 tax credit scheme introduced in 2013, and the various tax breaks under the Responsibility
and Solidarity Pact (RSP) announced by the new government; and (ii) an enhanced program of
regulatory simplification conducted in consultation with enterprises. The intention behind the tax
cuts, which are mostly in the form of lower labor taxes, is to restore profit margins and thus the
capacity of enterprises to invest, and to enrich the employment content of growth. The authorities
also planned to ease regulatory thresholds which create additional costly regulatory requirements
beyond 10, 20, and 50 employees, hampering enterprise growth and development. Though the bulk
of tax cuts will benefit firms, the authorities also plan to reduce taxes paid by household by about
0.25 percent of GDP over 2015-17, which should more directly support demand.
24.
Potentially significant impact of the tax cuts, but over an uncertain horizon. The
authorities have estimated that the tax reductions of the RSP would create about 200,000 jobs. Staff
has estimated that the reductions in labor taxes under the CICE and the RSP (about 1.4 percent of
GDP in all) would create at least 600,000 in the long run, after the capital stock has fully adjusted.9
However, both sets of estimates are derived from models that neglect demand side constraints,
which would affect the time it takes to realize these gains. For the authorities the gains can be
realized in full by 2017, while staff considered it would take longer.
25.
Slow product market reform has left the economy with unrealized potential gains. The
gradual product-by-product approach to liberalization pursued until now has had mixed results, as
reforms have been limited and often thwarted or watered down by vested interests, notably in
services. Indeed, the OECD Product Market Regulation (PMR) indicator shows no progress over the
last five years (Figure 8). Estimates of the gains from product market liberalization vary
considerably.10 A recent study estimated that a move by France to the OECD frontier in terms of the
PMR indicators could increase productivity by 3 percent after 5 years. 11 A 2014 staff study estimated
that a 1 percent productivity gain in regulated services accounting for less than 30 percent of GDP

(distribution, transport and storage, and other business services) ) could raise GDP by 0.8 percent
after two years.12
26.
A more decisive approach to product market reform going forward. The authorities said
they would pursue product market reform more proactively by stressing the purchasing power gains
that can accrue from eliminating rents. The chosen methods of reform are reducing barriers to entry
in regulated professions and/or changing price setting mechanism of regulated services. The
competition authority has also gained a more visible role, and has stressed, for instance, the
significant costs caused by constraints on competition in the transport sector. At the same time, the
authorities have restated the importance of state intervention in product markets to steer the
economy toward sectors with growth potential. Such intervention would come mostly in the form of
seed money provided by the state to leverage private initiative. Staff underscored the large potential
employment benefits of liberalizing opening hours in the retail sector and of the authorities’ plans
to simplify urban planning rules which currently stifle construction.
27.
A more adaptable labor market needed to complement supply side measures. Rigidities
in labor regulations and high and unpredictable dismissal costs have been a hindrance to hiring and
labor mobility (Figure 9). The law on job security and flexibility sought to increase adaptability by
easing cumbersome collective dismissal procedures and giving enterprises and their workers room
to renegotiate, within bounds, labor market conditions when faced with restructuring needs.13 This
option has been used sparingly so far, perhaps because of its limitations. Meanwhile, other
measures have been adopted to improve labor market functioning, including better targeted
professional training and the introduction of rechargeable unemployment rights which should
reduce inactivity traps.14 The unemployment insurance system is scheduled for review by 2016. Staff
noted that this is an opportunity to increase work incentives (for instance by revisiting degressivity
rules and the high ceiling on benefits) and to align contributions of employers to their job turnover.
28.
Improved social dialogue as a foundation for reform. Staff recommended expanding
further the scope for enterprise level negotiations over work and pay, in order to increase the
capacity of enterprises to adapt and take risks. The authorities supported the idea but noted that the
process needs to overcome a history of conflictual labor relations. Observers suggested that it was
because of this mistrust that state intervention had grown into a complex labor code and reliance
on the judicial system to settle disputes. In this regard, the authorities underscored that the decision
to involve social partners in the labor market reforms pursued since 2012 had already improved the
quality of the social dialogue; and that the law on job security and flexibility may not have resulted

Under the previous system, an unemployed person who took on a job would forfeit whatever remaining
unemployment benefits he/she had accrued. This reduced incentives to take on risky jobs that could end before new
unemployment eligibility is established. Under the new “rechargeable unemployment rights”, unused unemployment
benefits would be preserved if a new job is accepted and could be reactivated in case of loss of the new job.

in many successful negotiations, but it had spurred a welcome increase in discussions at the
enterprise level.
29.
The challenge of raising job prospects for the less skilled. A side effect of the minimum
wage (EUR 1,445.4 per month) has been to limit job creation for the low skilled—the unemployment
rate for workers with education up to a lower secondary degree was 16.2 percent in 2012, against
9.9 and 5.7 percent for those with intermediate and tertiary education, respectively. The authorities’
approach to limit the rationing effect of the minimum wage has been to eliminate labor taxes at and
near the minimum wage, and to expand subsidized job schemes and alternative job entry paths
(apprenticeships and work-study schemes). Targeted labor tax cuts are, however, costly (around
1 percent of GDP already in 2012, before the new set of tax cuts) and could create low-wage traps.
30.
The role of the minimum wage. Staff suggested that the objective of ensuring, through the
minimum wage (SMIC), that work pays a living wage should also be balanced against the cost of
exclusion from the labor market. It proposed that the indexation system of the SMIC include the
unemployment rate of the low skilled. The authorities considered that the SMIC was too central to
the social contract to contemplate any changes, and said they would continue to focus on
facilitating job placement through subsidized jobs, apprenticeships and by improving skills.
31.
Increased financial resilience and transition to banking union. The authorities
underscored the progress made in the various building blocks of the banking union, with
preparations for the Single Supervisory Mechanism well underway. Banks and the supervisor
expected that the comprehensive assessment would validate the quality of the loan portfolios. Even
so, they noted that surprises on the need for additional provisioning could not be ruled out, and
banks could face additional changes, as the ECB will likely try to harmonize the validation of bank’s
risk models across countries.15 The authorities also pointed to the actions taken to reinforce the
resolution framework at the national level first (new banking law) and at the euro area level. A single
resolution mechanism at the European level would, in time, address the problem of cross-border
resolution which has contributed to national ring fencing and fragmentation. In all, banks and the
supervisor believed that reinforced capital, liquidity and loss absorption buffers adequately mitigate
too-big-to-fail (TBTF) risks. By contrast, they were concerned that the uncoordinated multiplication
of regulatory safeguards (GLAC, MREL) could have unintended effects on financial intermediation.
GFSR analysis has found that implicit subsidies for systemically important banks remain sizeable,
suggesting that TBTF risks remain important, although regulatory reforms may have reduced them.
32.
Adapting to changing global regulatory standards. The French financial system, with
banks at the center of credit provision and life insurance at the center of savings mobilization, has
left banks with a structural funding gap which they have filled through the wholesale market.16 This
has resulted in relatively high loan-to-deposit ratios and elevated liquidity risk. Under pressure

frommarkets and regulations to build larger liquidity buffers, banks have reduced their loan-todeposit ratios considerably since 2011, helped in part by weak credit demand and low long-term
rates which have made life insurance products less attractive.17 However, under more stringent
liquidity requirements, banks’ deposit raising capacity may not be able to keep up with loan demand
in a more buoyant environment. The authorities believed two factors would reduce this risk:
increased securitization of bank loans and reliance of firms on market financing. Although these
alternative financing channels have grown in recent years, they remain limited. Given uncertainties
over their development, staff underscored that a reform of financial savings taxation might also
become necessary to level the playing field, for instance by taking a maturity-based rather than a
product-based approach to tax incentives.

STAFF APPRAISAL
33.
The strategy laid out by the authorities for the next three years holds the promise of
placing the French economy on more solid foundations over the medium term. Economic
policies may have appeared as lacking a clear direction in recent years, but they have gelled into a
coherent package based on an accurate understanding of the challenges. Furthermore, the
objectives are backed by well-identified policies. The strategy is ambitious and so naturally subject
to risks; and it could be boosted by deeper structural reforms.
34.
The chosen pace and instrument of fiscal adjustment are right. After three years of
substantial adjustment, the more moderate pace of adjustment chosen under the Stability Program
is appropriate given the weakness in the economy. Most importantly, the decision to anchor
adjustment by an explicit expenditure target addresses the fundamental structural weakness of
public finances. While simple expenditure containment will necessarily be part of the approach, the
emphasis should go to structural measures to ensure that the rate of growth of spending is curbed
permanently. On that score, important structural decisions have been taken, notably to rationalize
local government layers and to contain the growth of health spending.
35.
Both political and economic risks weigh on the strategy. Pressures to dilute the program
could increase as difficult reforms are introduced. These pressures should be resisted as there is little
room to deviate from the chosen course if both tax cuts and deficit reductions are to be pursued
simultaneously. The medium-term budget to be presented to parliament in the fall is an opportunity
to lock in specific measures underlying the adjustment, and thus reinforce the strategy. On the
economic front, a delayed recovery poses the greatest risk. If growth threatens to disappoint
projections by an appreciable margin, the pace of adjustment could be eased by moving forward or
accelerating proposed tax cuts. However, this should not be a reason to postpone structural
spending measures.
36.
Monetary conditions have been insufficiently supportive of adjustment and
restructuring of the economy. France did not suffer from financial fragmentation and lending rates
remain at record low levels. However, monetary conditions have arguably become tighter owing to
the strengthening euro and the fall of inflation and its impact on real interest rates. Such tightening
does not appear appropriate for France’s cyclical position.
37.
Supply side measures to restart investment and job creation are welcome and should
be boosted by reforms of labor and product markets. The proposed tax cuts will give breathing
space to enterprises whose squeezed profit margins have impeded investment. Regulatory
simplification is equally welcome. But these initiatives will not durably improve potential growth
unless they are supplemented by better functioning labor and product markets. The renewed focus
on fighting rents is a powerful guiding principle to spur reform and should be pursued by opening
protected sectors to greater competition. This process of labor market reform should be broadened,
with a view to giving enterprises and their workers more flexibility to negotiate working conditions.
This also requires the establishment of a more cooperative social dialogue. The minimum wage is a

24

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

FRANCE

legitimate instrument to ensure that work pays a living wage, but its level should also be set with a
view to limiting the exclusion effect it has for the low skilled. The authorities’ efforts to enhance
employment opportunities for the low skilled through job subsidies, apprenticeships, and workstudy programs are welcome, but these schemes are unlikely, by themselves, to close the
employment gap for this group.
38.
The economy and public finances are better shielded today from the risks of banking
shocks, but the evolving regulatory framework may require continued adjustments for banks.
Higher liquidity and capital buffers, enhanced loss absorption capacity, and a strengthened
European resolution framework will help mitigate too-big-to-fail risks. At the same time, the balance
sheet adjustments needed to meet these requirements could reduce the intermediation role of
banks in the French economy. While there are benefits to diversifying financing channels, these will
take time to develop and they are subject to risks. In this context it will be important to ensure that,
as banks adapt to the new environment, their financing role is not constrained by distortions in the
taxation of financial instruments.
39.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard 12month cycle.

Appendix I. Main Recommendations of the 2013 Article IV
Consultation and Authorities’ Actions
Fund Recommendations

Policy Actions

Fiscal Policy

“Many Directors saw merit in allowing for a
smoother pace of adjustment than envisaged in the
[2013] Stability Program to support the hesitant
recovery. Many other Directors advised the
authorities to persevere with the consolidation
plans under the program, noting that it already
allows automatic stabilizers to operate. While
Directors welcomed the shift to structural deficit
targeting, a number of them noted that nominal
targets should not be neglected.”

In the face of another growth shortfall and weakening revenue performance, the
deficit targets set in the 2013 Stability Program were missed: by 0.5 percent of GDP in
2013 and by a projected 0.8 percent of GDP in 2014 (authorities’ projections).

Rebalance fiscal adjustment toward expenditure
containment, including in the areas of social
security and local spending

Rebalancing is taking place: expenditure measures accounted for 35 percent of
structural adjustment in 2013, and an expected 86 percent in 2014.

Financial Sector Policy

Better align tax incentives on financial products
with regulatory objectives, including by removing
tax disincentives against deposits and phasing out
regulated interest rates.

The 2013 reform rebalanced tax incentives provided to life insurance savings toward
equity investments in SMEs. No other reform is being considered, as banks do not
presently appear constrained in their ability to provide credit.

Structural Reforms

Reform pensions in a way that increases labor
market participation rather than contribution rates.

The pension reform of 2013 relied in the short term on higher contribution rates, and
starting in 2020 on lengthening the contribution period to reach full pension

Pursue deeper labor market reforms to increase
employment of the young and low-skilled

Subsidized job programs were increased with a target of 340,000 new hires in 2014;
apprenticeship and work-study programs were also expanded.

Open the product and services markets to greater
competition.

The following sectors were opened to greater competition: pregnancy tests,
prescription eye-glasses, auto insurance, and veterinary services. The consumer law of
March 2014 opens the door to collective action.

Appendix II. France: Public Debt Sustainability Analysis
Under the baseline scenario, the debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to peak at
95.1 percent in 2015 and to decline to 89.1 percent by 2019 as economic recovery
gains traction and the primary balance shifts to a surplus starting in 2018. Due to the
maturity structure of the French debt, gross financing needs would increase
substantially in 2015, to 12.3 percent of GDP, but decline thereafter. The debt ratio
would be bumped up significantly in the event of protracted stagnation. The impact of
lower fiscal consolidation and higher interest rate remains comparatively more
limited. None of the standard stress tests would result in unsustainable debt dynamics.
Background. The combined effect of low growth over several years and the persistence of high
fiscal deficits, augmented by the fiscal stimulus of 2009, have increased the debt-to-GDP ratio by
almost 29 percentage points in six years to 91.8 percent in 2013. Despite ongoing fiscal
consolidation, the debt ratio is projected to continue to increase in the short term peaking at
95.1 percent of GDP in 2015 and decline thereafter.
Currently, yields on French debt
are at historically low levels. The
benchmark yield (10 years) has
declined from 4.7 percent in June
2008 to 1.85 percent in May 2014.
The spreads over German Bunds,
which had increased to almost
190 basis points in November
2011, were back to 40 basis points
early-June 2014.

has had a limited impact on the
debt service. Interest payments were at the historically low level of 2.3 percent of GDP in 2013.1
Baseline. Staff projects that the debt-to-GDP ratio will peak at 95.1 percent in 2015 and then
decline to 89.1 percent in 2019. Interest payments would remain low averaging 2.2 of GDP
during the projection period because: (1) fiscal consolidation leads to a primary surplus starting
in 2017; (2) interest rates are expected to increase slightly during the projection period; and (3)
given the maturity structure of the debt (average maturity of 7 years as of end March 2014), the
expected small increase of interest rates starting in 2014 has a slow pass-through to implicit
interest rate and the budget.

The drop in inflation also lowered the 2013 debt service as part of the French debt is indexed to inflation.



Macroeconomic assumptions. Recent growth performance has been affected by the weak
external environment and the drag caused by structural fiscal adjustment of 2.8 percent of
potential GDP over three years (2011-13). After two years of quasi stagnation, the economy
should grow by 0.7 percent in 2014. The growth rate is expected to rise steadily to
1.9 percent in the end of the projection period, with the output gap almost closed in 2019.



Fiscal outlook. The pace of structural adjustment is expected to slow from 0.9 percentage
point per year in the past three years to about ½ a percentage point per year during 201419. Structural balance would be almost reached by the end of the projection period. Primary
balance would shift to a surplus in 2018 and would be above its debt-stabilizing level starting
in 2016. The constant primary balance scenario at its projected 2014 level should be seen as
a tail risk triggered by a more widespread crisis in Europe.



Debt levels and gross financing needs. France’s high level of debt calls for using the higher
scrutiny framework.2 The gross financing need, despite the expected increase in 2015,
remains below the threshold. Part of the increase in the debt ratio reflects financial support
to other Euro area countries which grew from 0.2 percent of GDP in 2010 to 3.1 percent of
GDP in 2013.3 This support is expected to increase to 3.2 percent of GDP by 2014 before
declining.

Realism of Projections. The median forecast error for real GDP growth during 2005-13 is
-0.82 percent suggesting there is a slight upward bias in the staff projections. The median
forecast bias for inflation stands at -0.01 percent suggesting that staff projected inflation
accurately. At 0.08 percent, the median forecast error for primary balance is small and staff
projections have been slightly conservative.
The projected fiscal adjustment appears feasible. The reduction in the cyclically-adjusted
primary balance would average 0.6 percent per year during the projection period. This is smaller
than the averaged 0.9 percent reduction per year achieved during 2011-13. Cross-country
experience also suggests that fiscal adjustment projections are realistic. The projected
adjustment and level of the CAPB are below the thresholds that would cast doubt on the
feasibility of the adjustment, based on high debt country experience.4

2

The peak in the gross financing needs 2015 is in part triggered by the amortization of the large amount of debt
issued at the beginning of the crisis. For advanced economies that (i) have a current or projected debt-to-GDP
ratio above 60 percent; or (ii) have current or projected gross financing needs-to-GDP ratio above 15 percent; or
(iii) have or are seeking exceptional access to Fund resources; staff uses an extended set of tools to identify and
assess specific risks to debt sustainability. For these “higher scrutiny” cases, staff produces a standardized
summary of risks in a heat map and prepares a write-up to discuss risks, including any country-specific
considerations.

Heat map. Risks levels from the debt level are deemed high given that the relevant threshold to
which France’s values are compared is 85 percent and this threshold is breached under baseline
and all stress test scenarios. In contrast, France’s gross financing needs remain below the
benchmark of 20 percent of GDP in the baseline and all stress test scenarios. The debt profile
remains below relevant thresholds except for the share of public debt held by foreigners.
Following a steady decline from mid-2010 when foreigners held 70.6 percent of French debt, that
share has been increasing in 2013 and reaches 65.1 percent.
Shocks and Stress Tests. The DSA framework suggests that France’s government debt-to-GDP
ratio remains below 105 percent and its gross financing needs remain below 16 percent of GDP
under different macroeconomic and fiscal shocks.


Growth shock. Under this scenario, real output growth rates are lower by one standard
deviation over 2015-2016, i.e., 1.7 percentage points relative to the baseline scenario. The
assumed decline in growth leads to lower inflation (0.25 percentage points per 1 percentage
point decrease in GDP growth) and the interest rate is assumed to increase 25 basis points
for every 1 percent of GDP worsening of primary balance. Under this scenario, the debt-toGDP ratio would increase to almost 103 percent of GDP in 2016 and declines thereafter.



Primary balance shock. This scenario examines the implications of a dual shock of lower
revenues and rise in interest rate, leading to a cumulative 2.0 percent deterioration in the
primary balance over 2015-2019. Under this scenario, the debt-to-GDP ratio would increase
to 95.6 percent of GDP in 2015 and declines thereafter.



Interest rate shock. This scenario assumes an increase of 238 basis points increase in the
cost of debt throughout the projection period. The deterioration of public debt and gross
financing needs are back-loaded as old debt gradually matures and new higher interest rate
debt is contracted. In 2019, the impact on the gross financing needs is 1 percent of GDP and
2 percentage points for the debt-to-GDP ratio.



Real exchange rate shock. This scenario assumes 13 percent devaluation of the real
exchange rate in 2015 and examines the impact on debt through the inflation channel. Under
this scenario, the debt-to-GDP ratio would be marginally smaller (0.4 percentage point) than
in the baseline.



Combined macro-fiscal shock. This scenario aggregates shocks to real growth, the interest
rate, the exchange rate, and the primary balance while taking care not to double-count the
effects of individual shocks. Under this scenario, debt would reach almost 103 percent of
GDP in 2016 and decline to 100 percent of GDP in 2019. The gross financing needs would

adjusted primary deficit for any consecutive 3-year period during the projection horizon reaches is 2.94 percent
of GDP, well below the threshold of 3.5 percent of GDP.

Overall Financial Sector Oversight
Enhance public disclosure of financial
institution conditions and risks.

Give serious consideration to modifying MoF
participation in the Boards of ACP and AMF to
support independence of the supervisory
process.
Eliminate limits on headcount for ACP, AMF,
and H3C.

No New Action. The authorities consider availability and
comparability of financial information for the main banking
groups as adequate and no new initiatives are expected
(e.g., the publication of bank-by-bank data by ACPR,
including prudential returns). In 2013, the AMF conducted a
review of public documents of listed banks to ensure
information quality, and made recommendations to
individual banks. The authorities will continue to report on
financial sector developments in the context of BdF and
ACPR annual and other reports, BdF annual thematic
Financial Stability Review and AMF Cartographie des Risques.
No New Action. There are no plans to modify MoF
participation in ACPR or AMF Boards. The authorities
reiterated their disagreement with the FSAP evaluation.
No New Action. The authorities indicated that they have
sufficient margin of maneuver to accommodate the higher
resource needs related to additional responsibilities given to
ACPR by the 2013 banking law. The removal of headcount
limits is not expected in the near-term given pressure not to
expand budgets. Furthermore, the BdF can provide
supplementary resources to ACPR if needed.

Banking Supervision
Continue monitoring banks’ funding position
and availability of collateral to access liquidity
through the secured debt market and/or
central bank facilities.
Give ACP powers to assess the suitability of
Board members (of both banks and insurance
companies) and to require removal of all
unsuitable Board members.

Give ACP powers to ensure it receives prior
notification of major acquisitions and is,
therefore, able to consider them ex ante.

Require full and consistent disclosure of the

Done. ACPR monitors on an ongoing basis the liquidity
position of French banks. At regular intervals, ACPR
specifically reviews the preparedness of the main banking
groups in meeting new regulatory liquidity ratios.
Done. The law of separation and regulation of banking
activities of July 26, 2013 contains provisions amending the
Monetary and Financial Code to extend the ACPR’s authority
to assess the fit and proper requirements for membership to
the Board of Directors , the Executive Board or any other
body performing equivalent functions for:
- Credit institutions, upon appointment and throughout
their tenure and in case of emergency;
-Insurance firms, throughout their term, with the ability to
suspend when requirements of sufficiently good repute and
competence are no longer met and in case of emergency.
Partly Done. The 2013 banking law has strengthened
ACPR’s capacity to review major acquisitions by banks. No
other legislative initiatives on the matter are expected in the
near term. The authorities indicated that granting ACPR
formal approval powers for acquisition of EU financial
institutions would be inconsistent with EU law (Directive
2007/44/EC).
No New Action. The authorities reiterated their
disagreements with the FSAP evaluation and noted that

areas of progress include the development in the final accounts publication to include more
complete information on government assets and liabilities as well as disclosure of contingent

liabilities. Accounting standards have been changed to reflect accruals principles in a number of
areas, and these standards are clearly explained. The staff suggested that further steps could be
taken to identify and report quasi-fiscal activities in the budget presentation, provide a more
consolidated picture of fiscal activity outside the appropriation process, and improve the
reconciliation of stated policies with outcomes at the general government level.
These issues have been addressed in the Loi organique aux lois de finance (LOLF), which has become
fully effective on January 1, 2006. In addition to the annual appropriations, the first multi-annual
fiscal framework law was adopted in January 2009, and contains fiscal objectives for the
period 2009–12. The budget is organized along missions and provides details on the level of
appropriations for each mission and performance indicators by which the expected results of the
mission will be assessed ex post. The State Audit Office has been given the new assignment of
certifying the public accounts, and implementation of accruals basis accounting has been confirmed.
Parliamentary oversight powers have been strengthened.

Transparency in Monetary and Financial Policies—Update

IMF Country Report
No. 02/248, 11/13/02

Summary: The 2000 ROSC noted that transparency of financial policies is accorded a high priority
by all financial agencies assessed, and they are in observance of the good practices of the Code of
Good Practices on Transparency in Monetary and Financial Policies. The major agencies disclose their
objectives, their legal and institutional frameworks, and have open processes of policymaking and
regulation. The principles of transparency are observed by dissemination of relevant information to
the public and in the agencies’ arrangements for internal conduct, integrity, and accountability.
However, the staff noted that the framework for supervision and regulation applicable to mutual
insurance firms is not as well defined and suggested to improve its transparency. The transparency
of monetary policy was not assessed by the Fund team as the Banque de France is a member of the
European System of Central Banks and no longer conducts independent monetary policy.
Subsequently, the framework for supervision and regulation applicable to a specific group of mutual
insurance firms was modified in a number of steps. In August 2003, legislation created a single
supervisory body, the Commission de Contrôle des Assurances, Mutuelles et Institutions de
Prévoyance (CCAMIP) by merging the regular insurance supervisor (CCA) and mutualities’ supervisor
(CCMIP). Coordination with the banking sector supervisors was strengthened and the powers of the
supervisory authorities extended. In 2010, supervision of the banking and insurance sectors was

unified under the Autorité de contrôle prudentiel (ACP), which subsequently also was granted
resolution powers and was renamed the Autorité de contrôle prudentiel et de résolution (ACPR).

IMF Country Report
No. 05/398, 11/07/05

Summary: The report found that France is in observance of the Fund’s Special Data Dissemination
Standard (SDDS). In particular, the mandate of INSEE and the Banque de France for the production
of the six macroeconomic datasets is clearly defined, with the reporting burden and the
confidentiality provisions given special consideration notably through the CNIS. Professionalism is
central to the statistical operations of the two institutions, internationally and/or European accepted
methodologies are generally followed, the degree of accuracy and reliability of the six datasets is
remarkable, statistics are relevant and provided on a timely basis, and they are accessible to the
public.
The report made a number of suggestions for further improvements: the responsibility of INSEE as
the producer of government finance statistics should be clarified; data sharing between the Banque
de France and the rest of the French statistical system improved; classification and valuation
methods in balance-of-payments statistics reviewed; consistency between the current account of the
balance of payments and the goods and services account in the national accounts improved; the
timing of revisions in the quarterly and annual national accounts aligned; and identification of data
production units of INSEE facilitated.
France continues to implement several of the 2003 ROSC Data Module recommendations, including
by promoting a broader understanding of statistical data revisions, making greater use of firm-level
data to improve the measurement of changes in stocks, and intensifying work on portfolio
investment income with the objective of starting to record those transactions on an accrual basis.

Stress Testing the Banking Sector

IMF Country Report
No. 13/185, June 2013

Summary: The 2004 report concluded that France’s financial sector is strong and well supervised.
No weaknesses that could cause systemic risks were identified. The strength of the system is
supported by the financial soundness indicators and the strong conformity to the supervisory and
regulatory standards approved by the Basel Committee, IAIS, IOSCO, FATF, and CPSS. The degree of
observance of the transparency code is high in all relevant areas. The French banking sector has
been modernized and restructured over the past two decades and is well capitalized. Systemic
vulnerabilities in the important insurance sector are well contained. Securities markets are large and
sophisticated.
The FSAP Update undertaken in January and June 2012 confirmed the resilience of France’s financial
system to severe market pressures but also identified challenges faced by the system. While its
structure has contributed to solid profit generation, the crisis exposed the risks posed by the banks’
6

FRANCE

size, complexity, and dependence on wholesale funding. The larger banks have been actively
restructuring their balance sheets—moving to more stable sources of funding; reducing their crossborder presence; and building up capital. They remain, however, vulnerable to sustained disruptions
in funding markets and reduced profitability, which would cause delays in meeting capital-raising
plans.
The 2012 report confirmed that the regulatory and supervisory regime for banks, insurance, and
securities market was of a very high standard. Areas for improvement that emerged from the FSAP
Update included greater de jure independence of supervisory authorities; disclosure of the capital
treatment and related financial interactions within complex banking groups; a move toward a more
economic risk-focused approach to insurance regulation and supervision; and enhanced supervision
of investment service providers and financial advisors.
The 2012 report also found disclosure-related shortcomings. French banks and listed companies,
more generally, make extensive public financial disclosures under IFRS, and as a result of bank
regulations (Pillar III of Basel II). Nonetheless, disclosure of financial sector data falls short of
international best practice and enhancements would be highly desirable. Market discipline would
benefit from the publication of regular and comparable data on an institution-by-institution basis,
as well as detailed official analyses of financial sector developments in France.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
The economic database is comprehensive and of high quality, and data provision to the Fund is
adequate for surveillance. The authorities regularly publish a full range of economic and financial
data, and calendar dates of main statistical releases are also provided. France subscribes to the
Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard. The transmission of data in electronic form from INSEE
(Institut national de la statistique et des études économiques) and the profusion of data from various
institutions (Banque de France, INSEE, ministry of finance, ministry of labor and solidarity) have
helped to build an infrastructure, in which all data can be easily accessed through the Economic
Data Sharing System. A data ROSC mission conducted an assessment of the statistical system in
March 2003, and the report was published in October 2003. A factual update to the main report was
published in November 2004.
France’s monetary and banking statistics methodology conforms with the European Central Bank
framework, which provides comparable details as the Standardized Report Forms developed by STA.
Statistics for International Financial Statistics on banking institutions and monetary aggregates are
prepared on a monthly basis and are timely. Monetary data are also disseminated in the quarterly
IFS Supplement on monetary and financial statistics. France follows the European System of
Integrated Economic Accounts 1995 (ESA95). Data for GDP and its expenditure components are
available from 1978 onwards. Both annual and quarterly accounts provide reliable information,
although estimates from the two accounts differ slightly before the quarterly accounts are revised to
be aligned to the annual ones. In 2014, national accounts estimates were rebased to 2010 prices and
the methodology changed leading to an upward revision of the level of GDP and to a revision of
public finance data.
Government finance statistics have been strengthened recently. Both central and general
government data are presented in a more comprehensive fashion than previously and the data
for 2006 and 2007 also reflect the various impacts of recent budgetary reform. Although the source
data is collected by the Ministry of Economy and Finance, INSEE is principally responsible for the
compilation and dissemination of fiscal data in a framework that is consistent with ESA95. INSEE’s
website has recently been enhanced; in particular, it includes expenditure tables and government
revenues by subsector (central government, miscellaneous central government agencies, local
governments, and social security administration).
Starting in January 2014, balance-of-payments statistics are published monthly using the guidelines
set out in the sixth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual. Greater coherence between the
external current account and the rest of the world account in the national accounts is needed. In this
regard, work with promising early results has been undertaken on the transportation account.

Press Release No.14/326
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
July 3, 2014

International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2014 Article IV Consultation with France
July 1, 2014, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation1 with France.
The economy fared better than most other large euro areas economies through the crisis,
reflecting the resilience of private consumption, lack of financial fragmentation, and lower levels
of household and corporate debt. Banks’ financial position has also been strengthened. But after
two years of near stagnation unemployment remains high. A loss of competitiveness has also
weighed on growth, and compressed profit margins have constrained investment.
The outlook is for a gradual recovery, with GDP growth projected at 0.7 percent in 2014 and
1.4 percent in 2015, based on stronger external and domestic private demand, reflecting gains in
real disposable income and improved profit margins. Inflation is expected to remain subdued at
around 1 percent. These trends should allow the private sector to become a source of net job
creation this year.
Fiscal adjustment has been very substantial over the past three years, but the deficit was still
4.2 percent in 2013. The authorities’ program targets continued adjustment with a view to
closing the structural fiscal deficit over the medium term, based on a program of expenditure
containment. It also contains supply side measures, including tax reductions to reinvigorate
investment and job creation.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors noted that the French economy has shown resilience during the global
financial crisis, but the pace of recovery has been slow. Going forward, Directors welcomed the
authorities’ economic strategy outlined in the Stability Program and the National Reform
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.
2

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers
used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

Program, noting that the policies and objectives are well aligned. They concurred that an
ambitious adjustment and reform agenda is critical to address structural imbalances, guard
against future shocks, address the employment and competitiveness gaps, and boost the
economy’s growth potential. In view of the implementation risks of this ambitious agenda,
Directors considered that the strategy needs to be backed by comprehensive upfront measures in
the fall budget, and could be boosted by deeper structural reforms.
Directors endorsed the authorities’ plan to undertake a steady and more moderate pace of fiscal
adjustment, focusing on expenditure measures. They welcomed the progress made in reducing
the fiscal deficit during difficult economic times. Looking ahead, they noted that the proposed
pace of adjustment strikes an appropriate balance between the need to restore fiscal space and
support recovery. Further, they considered that anchoring the adjustment on expenditure
addresses the structural weakness of public finances, and urged the authorities to rely on
structural measures to ensure a permanent slowdown in spending growth. Recognizing that these
measures could be politically difficult to implement, they welcomed the authorities’ resolve to
remain steadfast in pursuing the reform program, as there is little room for deviation if both tax
cuts and deficit reduction are to be pursued simultaneously.
Directors welcomed the supply-side measures to revive investment and job creation, and
encouraged further reforms to labor and product markets. They supported the renewed focus on
fighting rents as a guiding principle to spur reform, and called for stronger effort to open
protected sectors to greater competition. Directors encouraged the authorities to build on the
labor market reforms taken since 2012 and to make the labor market more adaptable. They
stressed the importance of enhancing the scope for enterprise-level negotiation based on a more
cooperative social dialogue. Directors welcomed the efforts deployed to reduce unemployment
among the low skilled, but also suggested that the minimum wage could be set with a view to
increasing their job opportunities.
Directors observed that the economy and public finances are better shielded from banking shocks
thanks to the efforts made by banks to build stronger liquidity and capital buffers and to an
improved bank resolution framework. However, they noted that the regulatory framework is still
evolving, and that additional adjustment will be needed on the part of banks to meet prudential
requirements. Directors encouraged the authorities to ensure that banks’ key financing role is not
constrained during this process, and to facilitate it by leveling the playing field in the taxation of
financial instruments.

Statement by Hervé de Villeroché, Executive Director for France
July 1, 2014
We would like to thank staff for a very clear, balanced and interesting set of papers that
broadly validates both my authorities’ diagnosis on the French economy and the strategy that
is being put in place as a response. My authorities would also like to thank the Article IV
mission team for the open, thorough and candid discussions that took place in Paris during
the first half of May.
1. Economic outlook
General context and relative performance
So far, the global recovery has been gradual and uneven. Initiatives in the euro area helped to
ease financial tensions, particularly the decisions taken by the European Council in June
2012 and the increased involvement of the ECB announced in September 2012. However,
adjustments in the euro area, particularly in countries with major external and fiscal deficits,
and the appreciation of the euro exchange rate, put a drag on France’s external demand and
price environment at a time when France itself was restoring its macroeconomic balances.
In this difficult external environment, the French economy’s resilience has been remarkable
over the past years. As shown by the Figure 1 in the report, when compared to pre-crisis
levels, French economy GDP lays almost 4 points over the euro area average. Staff’s views
that France is now “behind other countries in the recovery cycle” is based essentially on the
OECD leading indicators, which did not capture the relative performance of the French
economy within the euro area over the past two years, and could therefore have been handled
differently. In particular, France is one of the countries where business investments resisted
most during the crisis.
Recent developments
There were encouraging signs at the end of the year 2013, with a recovery in investment and
jobs in the private sector for the first time in two years. The annual rate of growth now stands
at around 1 percent. The slowdown in Q1 2014 was caused by temporary factors such as mild
weather conditions which caused a decrease in energy expenditure, after-effect of the
exceptional possibility given to employees to unlock the savings invested in their company at
the end of 2013 and an increase in the tax rate on polluting vehicles. Regarding demand,
indicators such as manufactured goods consumption and commercial vehicles or based-on
VAT indicators of investments are encouraging. A rebound in consumption and investment is
then highly likely for Q2.
Macroeconomic forecasts
The French stability and growth program expects GDP growth to stand at 1 percent in 2014
before rising to 1.7 percent in 2015 and 2¼ percent in 2016-2017. Those forecasts were
broadly in line with staff projections at the time of their release. In the meantime, staff

2
revised its forecasts down due to a disappointing Q1 growth. The latest economic indicators
confirm that uncertainty remains high. My authorities will wait for the Q2 figure’s release in
mid August before deciding whether or not to revise the macroeconomic scenario for the
draft budget law.
Engines of growth
Overall, underlying macroeconomic scenarios and expected engines of growth are quite
similar in staff and authorities forecasts. The economic climate is expected to recover in
2014-2015 thanks to increased business and household confidence as well as the
implementation of structural reforms, notably the Responsibility and Solidarity Pact. As a
consequence, 2014-2015 should see a pick-up in corporate investments and in consumption;
France should also benefit from the ongoing recovery in the Eurozone and in advanced
economies, which would be materialized by an increase in exports. In a medium and long run
perspective, strong demographics, rising innovation efforts by French companies, highly
qualified and productive workforce, excellent infrastructure and a stable investment rate
during the crisis are factors bound to support France’s growth prospects.
2. Fiscal policy
My authorities intend to provide full support for the economic recovery by carrying out a
bold plan of reforms. The Responsibility and Solidarity Pact (Pacte de responsabilité et de
solidarité) is the keystone of the Government's strategy, which aims to support jobs and
competitiveness through labor-management dialogue and in consultation with all
stakeholders. The Pact also includes solidarity measures to support the purchasing power of
low-income workers. The entire package will be financed through an unprecedented effort to
reduce public spending.
Fiscal adjustment pace
The fiscal adjustment pace had been carefully calibrated in order to continue an ambitious
and still needed fiscal consolidation, but in a growth-friendly manner and while financing
priorities were identified for the future – secondary and higher education, justice and
security. The deficit will then continue to shrink gradually from 5.1 percent of GDP in 2011,
4.8 percent in 2012, 4.2 percent in 2013 to 3.8 percent in 2014 and 3.0 percent in 2015. In
keeping with our European commitments, the structural balance will be brought close to
equilibrium by 2017 by means of an adjustment of 0.8 point per year in 2014 and 2015,
followed by an adjustment of 0.5 point per year after that. We welcome the staff’s appraisal
that this pace is the “right” one.
Fiscal adjustment composition
Consistently with staff recommendations, the fiscal adjustment will rely exclusively on the
expenditure side, with an unprecedented target of €50Bn expenditure savings relative to
trend; this effort corresponds to a freeze in real expenditures (compared to growth of 1½
percent over the 2000 decade). Those savings will be used to close the structural deficit and

3
to reduce the aggregate tax and social security contribution rate, with a view to stimulate
competitiveness and household’s purchasing power.
The savings effort will be shared equally across the whole general government sector:
- Central government and central government agencies’ will shoulder the largest
portion (€18 billion over three years) by increasing efficiency and further improving
their cost control;
- Local government will bring expenditure growth back into line with inflation, saving
€11 billion through cuts on state transfers to local governments and the progressive
savings expected by a deep organizational reform (halving the number of régions by
2017, strengthening intercommunal structures, clarifying the division of powers by
eliminating the clause de competence générale and by eliminating the département
councils by 2021);
- The health insurance system will save €10 billion through ongoing structural reforms
to ensure the quality of care and the level of coverage while keeping costs under
tighter control;
- The social protection system will save €11 billion through reforms that have already
been adopted, notably regarding pensions and family benefits, and through future
measures, such as efficiency gains in the management of social security funds and a
stabilization of benefits in nominal terms, except for minimum social benefits, for one
year;
- Finally, civil servants will also play their part through a stabilization of the civil
service pay scale, but efforts to recruit new personnel in priority sectors will continue.
The supplementary budget bill presented on June 11th includes several extra savings
amounting to €4 bn while providing a break totaling €1.1 bn on income tax paid by middle
and low-income households (the cost of this measure will be compensated by the increased
revenues generated by the anti-fraud service - STDR).
Tax cuts - Responsibility and solidarity pact.
With the Responsibility and Solidarity Pact, French labor costs, which has already fallen as a
result of the Competitiveness and Employment Tax Credit (CICE) by €20 Bn, will be cut
further for a total reduction of €30 Bn (1 ½ percent of GDP), in order to boost employment
and restore firms profitability. By 2016, there will no longer be any social security payroll
contributions on minimum-wage jobs, other than unemployment insurance contributions.
Family allowance contributions will be reduced as well on jobs paying up to three and a half
times the minimum wage.
The Pact also includes a “fiscal side” that will imply business taxes to be streamlined and
reduced: the corporate social solidarity contribution (C3S), which is based on turnover and
not on income, will be reduced starting in 2015 and phased out by 2017; the exceptional
corporate income tax payment for large corporations will be phased out in 2016 and the
standard rate of corporate income tax will decrease starting in 2017, bringing it down to 28
percent by 2020.

4
At the same time, measures in favor of low-income workers will total €5 Bn by 2017,
including a reduction in the employee social security contributions for workers earning the
minimum wage.
Macroeconomic impacts
Based on the usual macroeconomic patterns, the Responsibility and Solidarity Pact will add
half a percentage point to growth and create nearly 200,000 additional jobs in the medium
term. In practice, this impact should be amplified by the commitments made by economic
and social players under the Pact and, more generally, by a positive confidence shock. This
assessment is broadly consistent with IMF staff’s own estimates of the total long term impact
of recent actions taken to lower the labor cost (including the CICE tax credit), which would
create at least 600,000 additional jobs.
3. Structural reforms
Labor market
Several structural reforms have already been undertaken over the past two years to improve
the functioning of the labor market, beyond the pro-employment tax policy:
(i)

(ii)

(iii)

The law on sécurisation de l’emploi, which transposed the national multisector
agreement on January 11, 2013, has created a framework for agreements to
protect jobs when a company’s economic situation deteriorates, while securing
workers’ careers, especially for the most vulnerable;
The Act, established on March 5, 2014, on vocational training which also
transposed a former agreement at the national multisector level, provides for
individual and transferable rights to training (individual training accounts) and
greatly simplifies the existing system. It expands the scope of the training
available, particularly for the most vulnerable individuals (including the
unemployed and young people); it also aims to ensure that training meets the
economy’s need for skills in the short and medium term;
Staff rightly emphasizes the structural impact of the introduction of
“rechargeable” unemployment benefit entitlements, which is part of the broader
social partners’ agreement, established on March 22, 2014, on unemployment
benefits; this scheme will reduce uncertainty for unemployed person to re-enter
the workplace, by preserving unused benefits if a new job is accepted.

On the minimum wage, my authorities do not endorse the staff’s recommendation to include
the unemployment rate of the low skilled in its indexation rule. A reform of the indexation
rule took place in 2013, precisely in order to better guarantee the purchasing power of the
low-income workers; a decrease in the minimum wage in bad times would have unacceptable
social consequences and an unclear macroeconomic effect (positive effect on labor demand
but negative impact on aggregate revenue). Moreover, it should be borne in mind that thanks
to existing tax and social exemptions, the tax wedge at the minimum wage is already within
international standards; together, the CICE tax credit and the Responsibility and Solidarity

5
Pact (by decreasing employers and employees contributions, notably at the minimum wage
level) will further reduce the tax wedge for the less skilled workers, supporting labor demand
and labor supply. These schemes seem simpler, more efficient, and more direct than
modifying the indexation of the minimum wage to support employment.
Product markets
France implemented several structural reforms of the product markets in order to simplify
administrative burden and red tape, fight economic rents and boost purchasing power and
competitiveness, in line with staff recommendations.
The Consumer Act, established on February 13, 2014, contains measures that promote
competition and consumers' interests. It creates a class action procedure for consumer
disputes under French law, particularly in the case of anti-competitive practices in services.
The provisions of the Act enhance competition in services, particularly in the healthcare
sector (opticians, chemists) and in the financial sector (banking and insurance). The measures
under this Act will have a significant impact on households' purchasing power, estimated at
€1.5bn in all. My authorities intend to take further steps, particularly in the healthcare sector,
with further reform of the market for certain so-called “borderline” products, which are
currently sold exclusively by chemists and greater price transparency in the distribution of
certain medical devices, such as prostheses and optical products.
Other measures will increase competition in services. The Act, established on January 2,
2014, eliminated restrictions in the legal and accounting professions in order to develop the
business of notaries, lawyers and accountants. Other changes to legislation are being
considered, such as a more cost-based approach to pricing in some of these professions.
Consultations will be held with professionals that may also cover the organization of certain
services with a view to achieve greater economic efficiency.
In addition, a large program for the simplification of administrative burden was launched in
July 2013. More than 200 measures were put forward, among them more than half are
directly linked to firms’ routine. To increase the impact of the program, the government has
been granted the right to speed up the process and has created a council for businesses’
simplification, which has already designed 50 new measures. From May 2014 onward, 10
new simplification measures will be decided upon each month.
By the end of the year, the Businesses Simplification Committee is scheduled to review the
rules governing access and permission to exercise certain professions, and submit proposals
to the Government. In June 2014, the French minister of the Economy asked the French
Competition Authority to issue an opinion on the fixation and revision of tariffs of specific
regulated professions (notaries, bailiffs, clerks of Commercial Court, etc.)
4. Financial sector
Staff’s report rightly underlines that French banks have made significant progress towards
meeting Basel III requirements. They meet the CRD-IV fully loaded minimum CET1 capital

6
requirement, and have strongly reduced their dependence to short term wholesale funding,
which only represents around 10 percent of total liabilities in 2013, compared to 30 percent
pre-crisis. It is certainly too early to assess their position relative to future net stable funding
requirements at this point in time, as the precise definition and calibrations of the NSFR ratio
are still under discussion by the BCBS; we however strongly believe in French banks’
capacity to meet the new requirements, if published in a not-too-distant future, in a timely
manner as they already did with the other CRD-IV capital requirements. Finally, it is likely
that the various regulatory and supervisory measures implemented so far at the national
(notably the loi de separation et de regulation des activités bancaires established on July 26,
2013 and European level, in particular the setting-up of the single supervision and resolution
mechanisms, as well as significant efforts made by banks to strengthen their resilience, have
decreased the systemic risks posed by a potential failure. The ongoing asset quality review
and the stress test will also be key to provide additional clarity on the banks that will be
subject to the ECB’s direct supervision.
My authorities remain confident that the financing needs of the economy will continue to be
satisfied when the demand for funding will become more buoyant, despite the evolving
regulatory framework. Recent reforms will help finance firms’ growth and development
following a two-pronged approach by providing them with the means to diversify their
financing instruments and sources. On one hand, French authorities have been working in
close liaison with all relevant market participants to ease market access of firms large enough
to benefit from market financing (the euro private placement workstream) and restarting a
robust and viable loan securitization market; this should allow all French firms to find
solutions when their demand for funding will gain further momentum. On the other hand,
work has been done to diversify potential sources of funding through reforms in the
insurance sector (reform of life insurance products, adjustment in the prudential treatment of
the simplest securitized products invested in loans to corporate) and the introduction of a
dedicated SME bucket in savings plan (PEA-PME).
5. Risk assessment
Uncertainty remains high, mainly stemming from international developments. The pace of
France's recovery hinges on that of the euro area. The recent actions taken by the ECB to
tackle the risk of a low inflation period are welcome, notably because monetary conditions
have become tighter over the past months, as staff’s report emphasizes.
There are also more specific risks. In particular, there is still uncertainty about the behavior
of private sector economic agents. Brighter prospects for growth could lead to a stronger
rebound in investment, which would entail more jobs, thereby boosting household incomes
and consumption. Policies to support competitiveness and employment will have a positive
impact, but the scale of this impact will depend on how businesses behave. Businesses could,
for example, pass on lower labor costs in the form of price competitiveness gains that favor
exports and curb domestic inflation. Alternatively, they may prefer to boost their profit
margins which could boost non price competitiveness.

7
Finally, while we broadly share the staff’s assessment of risks, we cannot agree on the risk of
a political resolve lessening. My authorities have repeatedly expressed a very strong
commitment to stay the course of reform and the method based on social dialogue allowed
significant achievements, notably on the labor market reform.
