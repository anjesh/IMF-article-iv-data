REPUBLIC OF PALAU
Staff Report for the 2005 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2005 Consultation with the Republic of Palau
Approved by Masahiko Takeda and Anthony Boote
January 31, 2006
•

This report is based on discussions held in Koror during November 2–17, 2005. The
mission team comprised Ms. Abdelati (Head), Mr. Hussain (both APD), and Ms. Kinoshita
(INS), and was assisted by Mr. Andrews (PFTAC) who visited Palau October 12–27, 2005.
Ms. Amador (Senior Advisor to Executive Director) attended the meetings.

•

In concluding the last consultation in February 2004, Executive Directors noted the
economy’s heavy reliance on grant-financed government activities and the downside risk
stemming from the scheduled sharp decline in this assistance from the United States in
2009. They urged the authorities to reduce Palau’s dependence on foreign assistance;
achieve medium-term fiscal sustainability; and remove investment impediments to build the
basis for sustained growth.

•

The team met with President Remengesau, Minister of State Schmull, Minister of
Commerce and Trade Besebes, Minister of Resources and Development Koshiba, Minister
of Education Katosang, Health Minister Yano, other senior officials, donors, and
representatives of banking, business and NGOs.

•

Palau accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections, 2, 3, and 4 in December 1997 when
it joined the Fund and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on the making of
payments and transfers for current international transactions.

•

Serious statistical deficiencies hamper effective surveillance.

•

Palau is on a 24-month consultation cycle.

•

The authorities consent to publication of the PIN, Staff Report, and Selected Issues.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Economic Developments and Challenges
•

Economic growth has picked up and inflation has remained low. Infrastructure building,
financed by grants and direct investment, has supported construction and rising tourist
and business arrivals. Fiscal performance has improved by curtailing current spending.

•

The near term outlook remains upbeat, but longer term prospects are uncertain. Growth
prospects depend on the magnitude of future grants and direction of economic policies.
The authorities hope for extension of U.S. grants beyond 2009.

•

The key challenges to sustained growth are achieving fiscal sustainability given the high
reliance on grants; environmentally sustainable private sector development; and
strengthening banking regulations and supervision.

Key Staff Recommendations
•

Further fiscal consolidation is necessary to prepare for the possible decline in U.S. grants.
Even if U.S. grants are extended at similar levels beyond 2009, consolidation is desirable
to enhance the country’s resilience to external shocks and better prepare for self-reliance.

•

To maintain recent fiscal gains, current spending must be contained in FY2006 below the
level in the approved budget. Continuing the path toward fiscal sustainability requires
further reductions in current spending together with comprehensive reforms to increase
revenue collection over the long term.

•

To eliminate impediments to private sector activity, investment regulations need to be
more transparent, land registration and dispute resolution accelerated, pressures to raise
the minimum wage resisted, and incentives to facilitate retention of trained Palauans
introduced.

•

To protect banking sector soundness, pending financial legislation and regulations need
to be adopted, and the newly established supervisory agency and intelligence unit should
be adequately staffed.

I. TRANSFORMATION SINCE INDEPENDENCE
1.
Since independence, the Republic of Palau has endeavored to overcome the
challenges it faces as a small island economy. The country gained independence in 1994
following a decade of domestic turbulence and joined the Fund in 1997. In spite of per capita
income of about $6,500 and solid social indicators, Palau faces development constraints

2.
Judicious management of foreign aid has helped build a foundation for private
sector growth. Sizeable grants from the United States, Japan and Taiwan Province of China
financed infrastructure to support tourism, albeit at the risk of damaging the fragile
ecosystem. The public sector’s share in economic activity has receded in line with the
government’s Management Action Plan of 2001, and political leadership has sought to foster
a broad consensus for prudent economic management. However, achieving consensus for
reforms has been challenging amidst the transition from a traditional tribal system to a
modern democracy.
3.
Palau benefits from substantial U.S. assistance. The Compact of Free Association
provides $600 million of grant assistance over 15 years from 1994 in exchange for the right
to maintain U.S. military facilities, if needed, and allow passage of military transport through
Palauan waters for 50 years. Grants aim to develop infrastructure and build a Compact Trust
Fund (CTF) to enable Palau to replace grants through sustainable withdrawals from
1999–2044 ($5 million per year from 1999–2009 and $15 million inflation-adjusted annually
from 2010). In recent years, budgetary grants from the United States have averaged about
18 percent of GDP, of which one third comes from federal grants outside of the Compact1
(Table 2).
4.
The authorities hope for renewal of the Compact agreement beyond 2009. Two
neighboring former U.S. administrative territories, the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM)
and the Republic of Marshall Islands (RMI), reached agreement with the U.S. government in
2003 to renew their Compacts for another 20 years.

II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
5.
After several years of slow growth, real
GDP grew by 5 percent in FY2004 and
FY20052 (Figure 1). Growth has been driven by a
steady increase in visitor arrivals with the start of
new airline routes and hotels, and ongoing
foreign-funded public projects that are
increasingly undertaken by domestic firms.
Inflation has been low in line with U.S. inflation.

Fiscal performance continued to
improve in FY2004 and FY2005. The overall
fiscal deficit (including grants) declined from 21
percent of GDP to under 5 percent of GDP in
FY2003–05 compared to the previous three years,
while the current budget balance improved by 8½
percent of GDP (Table 3) mainly due to sustained
annual reductions in non-wage current
expenditure. Revenue collection also
strengthened, though to a lesser extent, on account
of higher investment income, stronger economic
activity, and the re-instatement of the excises on
tobacco and alcohol in late 2003 and 2004, in line
with earlier Fund recommendations.

Strong tourist receipts helped offset the
impact of higher oil prices on the balance of
payments (Table 5). Palau’s tourism arrivals had
declined after the Asian crisis reflecting the
lagged effect of a strong U.S. dollar vis-à-vis the
currencies of competing Asian destinations. The
current account swung into surplus in FY2003
and improved further in FY2005 owing to
recovering tourism and fish exports (with the
return of migratory varieties) and lower capital
imports.

9.
Bank oversight remains inadequate but risks are mitigated by the dominant
presence of viable foreign banks. Information on banking activity is sketchy as bank
reporting is incomplete and irregular. About 80 percent of deposits are held by branches of
foreign banks that provide about two thirds in domestic credit and most deposits are insured
under the FDIC. The local commercial banks account for less than one third of banking
system assets in the form of smaller loans. However, interest rate spreads reach 15 percent,
reflecting high transaction costs for micro lending and inability of foreign banks to accept
land as collateral.
10.
Performance of the National Development Bank (NDBP) has markedly
improved. The Bank—following restructuring in 1999, new management in 2000 and 2003,
and new funding from a Taiwan POC loan in 2004—resumed credit extension raising its loan
portfolio to about 10 percent of GDP mainly to the housing sector. About 15 percent of its
portfolio is non-performing, but loans are all collateralized, provisioning is being increased
and collection strengthened, and it has maintained 6 percent profit-to-asset ratio in the last
four years.
III. ECONOMIC OUTLOOK
11.
The growth outlook for FY2006 and FY2007 remains upbeat. Relocation of
government offices in 2006 following completion of the Capitol complex will facilitate
expansion of housing and businesses out of crowded Koror. Tourism will benefit from
planned airport rehabilitation, new resorts, and expansion in scheduled flights. However, the
current account deficit is expected to widen and inflation to rise due to higher fuel costs.
Preliminary estimates suggest that a further 10 percent increase in oil prices can reduce the
current account balance by 1 percent of GDP and lower growth by ¾ percent of GDP.
Downside risks also stem from possible capacity constraints in capital project
implementation.

-7-

12.
Longer-term prospects are less certain. The economy faces substantial downside
risks from the possible sharp reduction in U.S. Compact grants and non-Compact U.S.
federal program assistance, whose continued

availability is unknown. While U.S. officials

Since the terms of future U.S. grant
assistance remains unknown at this stage, staff discussed illustrative scenarios for the
medium and long term. The scenarios are detailed in the background paper and outlined in
Box 1.
•

In the case where grants were not extended, two illustrative scenarios were discussed,
In the first, the FY2009 CTF balance is drawn down until its depletion to ease the
adjustment by allowing higher spending and growth (Scenario A). In the second, out
of concern for intergenerational equity, fiscal policies are geared toward preserving
the CTF’s real per capita value at the cost of lower spending and growth (Scenario B).

•

If the Compact were renewed, the pace of adjustment could be extended over a much
longer time period at higher levels of capital spending (and growth) without
jeopardizing the CTF’s real per capita value. Alternatively, the authorities could aim
for a higher CTF value that generates a sustainable income stream to fully replace
grant assistance as originally envisioned (Scenario C). Such a target would insure
against the risk of having to reduce capital spending as a share of rising GDP
(Table 6).
IV. POLICY DISCUSSIONS

14.
Discussions focused on (i) fiscal adjustment to permit a smooth transition to the postCompact assistance future; (ii) reforms to promote private sector development and growth;
and (iii) adequate regulation and oversight of the financial sector. In addition, the team
discussed competitiveness concerns and trade policies.
A. Fiscal Policy and Sustainability
15.
The overarching macroeconomic challenge is the need to prepare for the
eventual elimination of grant assistance. Presently, current grants cover about one third of
current spending needs, and if eliminated a sizeable fiscal contraction would be required.

Without Compact renewal, U.S. grants
decline to under 2 percent of GDP in
FY2010, and Palau becomes ineligible for
federal agency programs. Limiting the
expenditure adjustment to say ¾ percent of
GDP per year would entail depleting the
Trust Fund by FY2022, at which time large
expenditure cuts will be needed. On the
other hand, to preserve the CTF in real per
capita terms, expenditure would need to
decline by 1½ percent of GDP per year
between FY2005 to FY2014 at which time
CTF returns could sustain lower fiscal
2500
deficits. However, the magnitude and
speed of expenditure compression
under this scenario could have a severe 2000
effect on household incomes and public
services. An economic slump would be 1500
likely in the medium term.

The speed and extent of fiscal adjustment depends on the magnitude of future grants, chosen
objectives, and assumed parameters. Without prejudice to the outcome of negotiations, it is
assumed that if the Compact is renewed, it would provide an average 18 percent of GDP in total
budgetary support for 15 years plus an

different levels of capital spending,
depending on the future magnitude of grants
and the chosen CTF target.

On the other hand, Compact renewal
would allow more gradual fiscal

contraction. If U.S. grants are
extended at similar levels until
0
FY2023, a more gradual phasing of the
required expenditure retrenchment
would be feasible. At the same time,
the real per capita value of the CTF could be enhanced to a level which, consistent with the
original objectives of the CTF, would generate annual income to replace for foreign aid after 2023.
Higher public investment could allow real growth averaging 3-4 percent of GDP.

-9-

Spending on health and education, accounting for nearly 30 percent of total spending, is
among the highest in Pacific islands. Although this has contributed to good social indicators
for the Palau population (Table 7), it is not sustainable in the long term and has created a
culture of dependence on free public services that the country cannot afford indefinitely.
The authorities’ paramount goal is to achieve financial independence by
16.
strengthening domestic revenue to cover current spending and build an adequate
reserve fund to cope with external vulnerabilities. Staff noted that the goal of covering
current spending by domestic revenue generation remains far-off, requiring, for example,
current spending to decline by as much as one quarter (about 12 percent of GDP) and tax
revenue to increase by one fifth (about 5 percent of GDP) in the long run. The authorities
concurred with these targets, but viewed them as impossible to achieve within a short period
of time. Staff agreed that an adjustment of this magnitude would cause less social strain if it
were spread over 10–15 years, although the required speed of adjustment depends on
assumptions on future grants.
FY2006 budget

17.
Staff cautioned that the targets of the
FY2006 budget approved by Congress in
October 2005 reverse recent consolidation
efforts. The authorities concurred with staff that it
would be more appropriate to target an overall
deficit of ½ percent of GDP rather than 4¾
percent of GDP. Staff urged that spending on
goods and services be lower than budgeted by
about 2 percent of GDP in line with recent step
reductions, and Ministry of Finance officials
intend to take additional measures to contain this
category of spending. They expect the ongoing
hiring freeze to allow the wage bill to be
compressed while accommodating the new civil
service salary structure and addressing staffing
shortages in banking supervision, if these cannot
be filled through reassignment. Staff welcomed
the planned phased repayment of spending arrears
to suppliers that amount to 1 percent of GDP over
three years.

Revenue is expected to outperform the budget projection, exceeding last year’s
18.
outcome by ½ percent of GDP. With unchanged tax collection effort, revenue would be
maintained at 21 percent of GDP, and an additional ½ percent of GDP would come from
recent measures (change in the import duty base from f.o.b. to c.i.f. and new airport fees).

exemptions on import duties, and adjust the reference
price for the hotel room tax, the latter to allow the
tourism sector to contribute more fully to domestic revenue generation. Staff agreed with
these measures which together could yield up to 1 percent of GDP in FY2007. Since
comprehensive reform is to be postponed, staff advised accelerating administrative measures,
including introducing a full assessment system, a single taxpayer identification number,
strengthened monitoring, and audit and penalty systems to improve the compliance rate.
Nevertheless, the bulk of the adjustment will have to fall on expenditure reforms.
21.
The pace at which current spending must be reduced and the amount of capital spending cuts
will depend on the future level of grants and the government’s long-term CTF objective. As
suggested in the analysis in Box 1, the total expenditure adjustment needed over the long run
is in excess of 20 percent of GDP (and as much as 30 percent of GDP without Compact
renewal) spread over 10 to 25 years, of which capital spending cuts account for 10-15 percent
of GDP. However, capital expenditure is expected to gradually decline as its funding sources
dwindle, with somewhat limited short-term macroeconomic impact as the bulk is spent on
foreign goods and services.
Adjusting current expenditure requires specific measures to cut the wage bill
22.
and spending on goods and services. Palau’s high government wage bill will need to be
reduced. The authorities believe this will decline over time in the context of the hiring freeze
and as the government withdraws from public services that can be undertaken by the private
3

- 11 -

sector. The government’s cost reduction plan has so far identified measures that could yield
savings of 2-3 percent of GDP in the next 2-3 years from outsourcing: water and sewer,
school and hospital meals, security and janitorial services, road repair to allow reduction in
the staffing of public works, and management of the airport facilities to defray their
dependence on budgetary outlays. In addition, they plan to introduce user fees for sports
facilities and medical care. Further cuts will be needed over the long run to achieve the
remaining savings of about 8 percent of GDP.
Public debt is low at 13 percent of GDP. Palau incurred a first loan (17 percent of
23.
GDP) on concessional terms in 2000 to finance construction of the new Capitol complex.
Another $15 million loan was contracted in 2004 for airport rehabilitation, but only
$1.5 million (1 percent of GDP) has been drawn due to the subsequent availability of U.S.
grant financing. The authorities intend to avoid contracting of new loans, and to build a
cushion of usable reserves, possibly from unspent CTF withdrawals or any revenue overperformance, to cope with vulnerability to shocks.
B. Exchange Rate Regime and Trade Policies

24.
The exchange rate regime remains
appropriate given Palau’s small size and
predominance of U.S. grants and trade flows.
The tourism industry appears to be competitive.
Palau compares well to other tourism-dependent
island economies in terms of visitor arrivals,
expenditure, and infrastructure.4 The country
scores high marks in several categories of the
World Bank’s Doing Business survey (Figure 3)
and private sector wages are kept low owing to
the abundance of expatriate workers accepting
lower wages than the stipulated minimum
wage for Palauans.
Palau is expected to maintain its
25.
open trade system. The tariff structure
has five nonzero bands, most imports are
subject to a 3 percent rate, and the
unweighted average rate is below 3
percent. About 30 percent of trade taxes
are collected from cigarette and alcohol
duties that are subject to additional
specific taxes. A harmonized system

were introduced as part of customs modernization to further facilitate trade. Licensing is
limited to requirements for agricultural quarantine and health concerns. To preserve the lowtariff regime, staff advised against raising the general tariff rate from 3 percent to 5 percent
as a proposed revenue generating measure, but saw merit in removing duty exemptions.
C. Private Sector Development and Economic Diversification

26.
Opportunities for private sector growth could be further exploited. Outside
tourism, potential areas of growth include agriculture, fish processing, handicrafts, and some
services currently provided by the public sector. The tourism development plan encourages
investors to shift toward higher-end tourism with higher domestic value-added. However,
key impediments include non-transparent investment regulations that benefit the betterconnected individuals, shortage of Palau skilled labor, limited access to land, and further
infrastructure needs.
In spite of the recent increase, foreign direct investment (FDI) has not realized
27.
its full potential. FDI reached 13 percent of GDP in FY2005, far above the regional average,
on account of some large hotel and airline projects. However, foreign businesses complain of
the inability to own land or use it as collateral, restrictions on sectors in which foreigners are
allowed to participate, the stipulation that 20 percent of employees be Palauan citizens for
investments below $0.5 million, and an annual $500 permit fee for hiring expatriates that
Palauan employers do not have to pay. The mission noted that these restrictions have
promoted the proliferation of arrangements (called “fronts”), whereby foreign investors
operate under a Palau silent partner, that reduce tax compliance and subject both Palauan and
foreign partners to fraud and liability risks. One proposal under consideration is to equalize
the $500 annual permit fee between foreign investors and Palauan employers to reduce the
incentive for fronts and encourage employment of Palauan labor. This and other issues are
under debate in the business community and within Congress and a consensus will need to be
reached on the benefits of removing impediments to foreign investment.
Limited access to land has been a key constraint for domestic and foreign
28.
investment. About 40 percent of plots remain unregistered, and restricted access to land
hampers development of agriculture and credit-financed investment. The authorities intend to
speed up titling and registration, and have introduced a process of quiet title to register lots as
state land after an undisputed 45-day announcement, allowing its lease for private use. A bill
that passed Senate hearings in December 2005 proposes extension of land leases to
foreigners from 50 to 99 years.

- 13 -

Legislated Minimum Wage
29.
Skilled labor shortages are
exacerbated by the tendency of Palauans to
seek employment in the United States,
making it more difficult for foreign investors
to hire the required percentage of Palauan
workers. Foreign workers make up nearly one
half of the labor force, mostly in unskilled
jobs that are unattractive to Palauans. Staff
argued against the proposal to increase the

minimum wage, already the highest among
Islands
Pacific islands, as an ineffective measure for
encouraging the return of Palauans working
abroad. Indeed, it could further encourage substitution of Palauan unskilled workers by
foreign labor that is not subject to the minimum wage legislation and has a much lower
reservation wage. However, staff saw potential merit in requiring recipients of statesponsored scholarships for study abroad who do not return to repay study costs.

Note: For Palau, the minimum wage only applies to citizens employed in the public sector.

D. Financial Sector Soundness

30.
Palau has a large banking sector relative to its population but lacks adequate
regulation and supervisory oversight. The financial sector consists of eight commercial
banks, one development bank, and several other financial institutions.5 Pending passage of
regulations, the quality of the loan portfolio is not known nor the possible impact of any
banking sector problems on public finances. However, all banks reported improved
profitability in the last two years and progress in loan recovery following a rise in delinquent
loans after the economic slump in 2001. Progress has been disappointing since the passage in
2001 of a watered-down version of the Financial Institutions Act (FIA) and establishment of
a governing Board for the supervisory Financial Institutions Commission (FIC). In the same
year, the Money Laundering and Proceeds of Crime Act (MLPCA) and the Mutual
Assistance in Criminal Matters Act were passed. However, Palau was assessed in 2002 under
the Fund’s Offshore Financial Center (OFC) assessment program as non-compliant on 16 out
of 25 Basel core principles, and the situation remains unchanged. Fund TA missions in 2004
advised that unless the proposed FIA amendment is adopted without further modification,
neither prudential nor AML/CFT supervision will be feasible in Palau. They also saw a need
for strengthening the still pending amendment to the MLPCA to comply with key aspects of
the FATF 40+9 Recommendations.
The FIC lacks the resources and sufficient authority to carry out its supervisory
31.
responsibilities. Four years after establishment, it has received only one out of five
recommended professional staff and a fraction of the planned budget due to concern by some
legislators that the proposed FIA amendment could grant FIC’s staff and Board excessive
power that could be misused for political objectives. Absent adoption of the amendment, the
5

- 14 -

FIC lacks clear authority to introduce regulations, investigate, or enforce compliance through
on-site inspection. Nevertheless, its officials reported that they had advised remedial action
when needed and successfully decommissioned some banks in spite of law suits questioning
their authority under current legislation. Staff stressed the need for passage of the FIA
amendment which would allow the FIC to issue financial regulations along the lines
recommended by MFD and LEG. Moreover, the FIC and the Financial Intelligence Unit
must have the necessary budget, staffing, training, and governance structure to fulfill their
duties.
32.
As in previous discussions, the authorities agreed with staff recommendations
but pointed to legislative bottlenecks. They intend to strengthen efforts to engender support
for passage of needed legislation and regulations and to provide FIC with adequate resources.
After the mission, the Senate held a first hearing on financial legislation in early December
and FIC has initiated a recruitment search of additional staff. MFD and LEG stand ready to
provide further capacity-building technical assistance once bank examiners have been
recruited.
The National Development Bank needs to further strengthen its loan recovery
33.
efforts. Bank management explained that most bad loans initially arose from the weak
economy in 2001 and they had since proceeded more cautiously in expanding their new
loans. Staff welcomed the success of recent external audits to reinforce collection and
encouraged continued efforts in conjunction with capacity building assistance.
E. Statistical Issues

34.
Serious deficiencies remain in most areas of economic statistics with the notable
exception of public finance (Annex V). Some collected statistics cannot be compiled or
disseminated due to shortage of trained staff and high staff turnover. Recognizing capacity
constraints, staff commended the authorities’ efforts to improve national account and balance
of payments statistics, and welcomed the intention to seek training for new staff. Staff and
the authorities concurred that the Office of Planning and Statistics would benefit from
additional technical assistance to build capacity, especially to maintain the national accounts
system. In the longer term, as customs and banking data become more readily available, they
would benefit from help in refining the balance of payments. The authorities stressed that
they welcomed further hands-on help at regular intervals. Once they are more adequately
staffed, they would be able to devote some resources to the GDDS project.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL

35.
Judicious management of foreign aid and political stability have helped build a
foundation for economic growth. Growth has picked up after several years of stagnation
and inflation remains subdued. Foreign grants have supported infrastructure development
that has encouraged tourist and business visitors since 2003 and provided opportunities for
local companies. Fiscal performance has improved, with a narrowing of the large current

- 15 -

fiscal deficit by 8½ percentage points of GDP in the last three years compared to the previous
three years.
However, longer-term prospects depend on the future level of grants and
36.
direction of policies. Palau remains highly dependent on grant assistance to provide public
services and pay the relatively large civil service wage bill, and vulnerable to external shocks
and risks of over-exploiting its ecosystem. Shortages of skilled staff, restrictions on land
ownership, and cumbersome and non-transparent investment procedures, impede private
sector activity.

37.
Possible renewal of Compact grants would allow the adjustment to be phased
over a longer period of time, but it would not obviate the need for adjustment.
Postponing fiscal adjustment efforts and structural reforms until after a decision is made on
future grants would make it harder for the country to adjust and achieve economic selfreliance. Given the uncertainty, targeting a pace of adjustment consistent with a lower level
of future grants reduces the risk of future fiscal and social strains.
The government’s stated long-term objective of covering current spending from
38.
domestic revenue generation is therefore appropriate. While currently comparable to
similar countries in the region, the tax base could be broadened by eliminating exemptions
and addressing non-compliance. But over the medium term, the best option is a
comprehensive overhaul of the tax system centered around a VAT or consumption tax that
eliminates cascades in the gross receipts tax, and more efficient corporate and personal
income taxes that would capture those currently outside the tax net.
The bulk of fiscal adjustment will nevertheless need to come from expenditure
39.
containment. For 2006, current spending should be curtailed below the proposed budget. In
the medium term, current spending has to be steadily reduced from 45 percent of GDP to
around 32 percent of GDP by downsizing the public sector. This can be achieved by
continuing the hiring freeze, capping the nominal rate of increase in non-wage current
spending, raising user fees for medical and other public services, and outsourcing and
privatizing some services.
Use of the U.S. dollar as domestic currency provides welcome monetary stability.
40.
Over one half of grants and imports come from the United States and the real effective
exchange rate has been relatively stable. Tourism appears relatively competitive and they
plan to target more high-end visitors that are less price sensitive.
It is Palau’s best interest to maintain its open trade system. This can be achieved
41.
by removing duty exemptions, followed by introducing a consumption tax in the context of
comprehensive tax reform, instead of raising tariff rates. The recent introduction of the
harmonized system of tariff classification and computerized customs filing system will
further facilitate trade.
Removing investment impediments would help establish the basis for sustained
42.
growth. Foreign investors seek local partners to circumvent foreign investment restrictions

- 16 -

on sectors of activity, owning land, minimum domestic labor requirements, and the higher
cost for foreign labor permits. Staff welcome proposals before Congress that aim to reduce
investment restrictions, and the quiet title process that has facilitated registration and leasing
of state land. A consensus will need to be reached on the benefits of further removing
impediments to foreign investment in Palau, while safeguarding the interests of the local
community.
Palau is becoming increasingly dependent on foreign labor. Raising the minimum
43.
wage for Palauans would be counter-productive given easy access to employment
opportunities in the United States at much higher wages, combined with a much lower
reservation wage for unskilled Asian labor. Requiring recipients of state-sponsored
scholarships for study abroad who do not return to repay study costs may increase incentives
of Palauans to return.
In spite of initial progress, the relatively large banking sector lacks adequate
44.
regulation and supervisory oversight. The Financial Institutions Act (FIA) adopted in 2001
provides for establishment of a Financial Institutions Commission but did not provide it
sufficient authority to undertake oversight. Urgent adoption of the amendment to the FIA,
and adequate resources including two bank examiners, would allow the Commission to issue
regulations, and to exercise supervisory functions. Amending the Money Laundering and
Proceed of Crimes Act would help address money laundering concerns. Both the FIC and
Financial Intelligence Unit must have the necessary authority, budget, and governance
structure to fulfill their duties. Ongoing efforts to strengthen the National Development Bank
should be continued.
While data provision for surveillance purposes is still adequate overall, staff’s
45.
analysis was affected by serious shortcomings in the areas of banking and national accounts.
Further efforts are needed to improve data collection, compilation methodology, and
dissemination.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be conducted on the
46.
24-month consultation cycle.

REPUBLIC OF PALAU:
SUPPORT FROM THE PACIFIC FINANCIAL TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CENTRE1

The Centre’s assistance since Palau joined the Fund in 1997 has included 25 advisory missions,
the participation of officials in seminars (18) and secondments mostly in the tax administration
area (10). A statistics advisor visited Palau ahead of the 2005 Article IV consultation.
Public Financial Management

No assistance in this area has been requested by the Palau authorities since 2003.
Representatives from the Ministry of Finance have been invited by PFTAC to join the newlyorganized Pacific Financial Managers’ Association (PaFMA) in 2006.
Tax Administration and Policy

In response to a request received in July 2003, PFTAC reviewed and provided extensive
comments on the draft “Registration Corporation Act” and the draft “Reinvestment Incentive
Act”. In early 2004, a customs administration mission visited Palau to design a strategy and
an action plan to modernize the Customs Division. In mid-2005, a tax administration mission
visited Palau to review the organizational structure of the Division of Revenue and Taxation,
and its operations.
Financial Sector Regulation and Supervision

PFTAC’s advisor was involved in two follow-up missions for implementing the Financial
Institutions Act (passed in June 2001), as well as to organize the Financial Institutions
Commission and the drafting of licensing guidelines. Subsequently, an MFD peripatetic
advisor paid a number of visits to Palau. However, the implementation and enforcement are
still pending.
Economic and Financial Statistics

The post of Government Statistician has been vacant since late 2002, and two graduate level
statisticians are in post at present. A PFTAC mission visited Koror in December 2003 and in
April 2004 to assist the authorities in documenting and improving the system of national
accounts and with finalization of the GDDS metadata. Subsequently in October 2005, a
PFTAC statistics advisor assisted the authorities in revising national accounts for 2001–05.
Follow-up missions are expected in the near future.

Pacific Regional Strategy FY2006–2009, May 2005.
Embarking on a Global Voyage: Trade Liberalization and
Complementary Reforms in the Pacific, September 2002.

Palau became a World Bank Group member in December 1997. Since then, the Bank has
provided technical assistance in a number of areas, namely oil and gas and natural resource
management, and in the health sector.
In early-1999, the South Pacific Project Facility, a small- and medium-enterprise
development initiative of the International Finance Corporation provided advisory services to
the National Development Bank of Palau, as well as to a number of SME projects in the
tourism sector. A diagnostic review of the investment climate was conducted by the Bank
Group’s Foreign Investment Advisory Services in 1999, and has since undertaken two
separate reviews of the new draft foreign investment legislation.
The Bank’s fifth biennial Regional Economic Report for its Pacific Island member countries,
including Palau, was issued in September 2002. The report focused on their efforts to
integrate more closely with the global economy. It evaluated the strategy to enter into a
regional trade agreement and analyzed the interaction of trade liberalization with
complementary reforms in taxation and the public sector.
The new Pacific Regional Strategy, which covers Palau, will direct the Bank’s work in the
region from 2006 to 2009. It focuses on creating an environment conducive to generating
sustainable economic growth and employment, while recognizing that small populations and
marked remoteness of the Pacific island countries pose significant development challenges to
the region. The Bank seeks to play a selective role in Palau, focusing on providing targeted
policy advice and analytical support to leverage donor resources and build local capacity.
Palau is an IBRD-eligible country.

REPUBLIC OF PALAU: RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK1

Total Commitments: None
The Republic of Palau joined the Asian Development Bank on 29 December 2003, as its
sixty-third member. While admitted as a regional country, its development status was left
undetermined and its country classification was to be undertaken. AsDB prepared a Country
Economic Report for Palau and the Development Status and Country Classification of the
Republic of Palau which served as the basis for a determination of Palau’s development
status. On 16 December 2005, the Republic of Palau was re-classified as a Pacific developing
member country.
In order to scope and plan the future programming, a pre-Country Programming Mission was
undertaken in November 2005. Guided by new AsDB’s Pacific strategy—Priorities of the
Poor: A Pacific Strategy for the Asian Development Bank (2005–2009), the AsDB suggested
future missions, including a joint mission with the United States Department of the Interior,
to conduct private sector assessment.
A country programming mission is envisaged in the second quarter of 2006.

ANNEX V

REPUBLIC OF PALAU: STATISTICAL ISSUES

While data provision for surveillance purposes is still adequate overall, staff’s analysis was affected
by serious shortcomings in the areas of banking and national accounts. These shortcomings stem
mainly from capacity constraints. The Office of Planning and Statistics is responsible for the
compilation of national statistics. There are presently no official statistical publications at the
aggregate level and limited data are available on national accounts, monetary developments, and the
balance of payments. However, since the conclusion of the first Article IV consultation mission in
July 1999, the authorities have been providing to the Fund the available core economic data on a
periodic basis. PFTAC advisors provided assistance during 2003–2005 in improving the national
accounts statistics, and with compiling the GDDS metadata. The authorities have committed to
adopting the GDDS and have appointed a country coordinator but much remains to be done in this
area. The long awaited passage of the Statistics Law would further help formalize data collection and
reporting.
A.

Real sector

Estimates of the national accounts have only been compiled on a sporadic basis since 1984, and have
been interrupted since late 2002. GDP data by economic activity at current prices were compiled by a
UNDP consultant, the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific,
and under a joint project by the University of Oregon and the U.S. Department of Interior. A UNDP
consultant produced a comparable set of GDP estimates for 1992–1999 in line with available sector
indicators for these years.
The authorities’ capacity to produce consistent official estimates of the national accounts is very
weak. GDP growth rates reported in the staff report are based on preliminary estimates from sector
indicators. A PFTAC advisor who visited Palau in October 2005 discovered serious deficiencies in
source data, and follow up visits will be needed to provide hands-on assistance. One previously
trained official was re-hired following the mission and efforts are also being made to train new staff.
A consumer price index has been compiled since 2000 on a quarterly basis, but inconsistencies have
appeared since the last quarter of 2003.
B.

Government finance

Fiscal data are compiled at both the national and state level as part of their respective annual
budgetary processes. The authorities have provided these fiscal data to APD in a standard Fundformat usable for analysis.

- 34 C.

ANNEX V

Monetary accounts

Audited balance sheet data are not regularly provided by banks to the authorities as they are not
legally required to do so, and hence there is no official collection of a banking survey. At present, the
banks only file quarterly tax forms to the Ministry of Finance. Although most banks have been
reporting to the Financial Institutions Commission since 2003, reports are often incomplete and the
lack of standardized format and classification guidelines prevent aggregation and meaningful
analysis. Lack of data prevents preparation of most financial soundness indicators.
D.

Balance of payments

Balance of payments data compilation remains weak. Estimates of the balance of payments have
been prepared by the staff based on data provided by the authorities on imports, interest income,
official grants, debt service, financial holdings of the government, and rough estimates of exports,
services, private transfers and foreign direct investment. Compilation of the balance of payments is
further complicated by a lack of commercial banking data due both to the absence of a reporting
system for international financial transactions of bank clients as well as the lack of legal reporting
requirement for commercial banks.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
March 2, 2006

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes Article IV Consultation with the
Republic of Palau
On February 15, 2006, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Palau.1
Background
The Republic of Palau is a small island economy that relies heavily on tourism and external
assistance. Palau faces development constraints common among other Pacific island
economies, including vulnerability to external shocks, a narrow production and export base,
geographical isolation, and scarce labor.
Palau benefits from substantial U.S. assistance under the fifty-year Compact of Free
Association. Under the agreement, direct payments from 1994 to 2009 aim to support economic
self-reliance by financing current expenditure, developing infrastructure, and building the
balance of the Compact Trust Fund (CTF) to provide a sustainable income stream from 2010 to
2043. In recent years, budgetary grants from the U.S. have averaged about 18 percent of GDP,
of which one third comes from federal grants outside of the Compact. CTF returns have been
lower than anticipated and the CTF balance stood at US$153 million (106 percent of GDP) at
end- 2005. In addition to U.S. grants, Palau receives sizable grants from Japan and Taiwan
Province of China to finance infrastructure projects.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

-2Economic growth has picked up in recent years while inflation has been low. After several years
of slow growth, real GDP grew by 5 percent in FY2004 and FY2005, driven by a steady
increase in visitor arrivals with the start of new airline routes and hotels, and externally funded
government projects.
Palau’s fiscal performance has continued to improve in FY2004 and FY2005. The overall fiscal
deficit (including grants) declined from 21 percent of GDP to under 5 percent of GDP in
FY2003-05 compared to the previous three years, while the current budget balance improved
by 8½ percent of GDP, mainly due to the capping of the rate of increase of non-wage current
expenditure. On the revenue side, revenue collections strengthened as a result of higher
investment income, stronger economy, and the re-instatement of excises on tobacco and
alcohol in 2003 and 2004. Fiscal consolidation has allowed Palau to avoid borrowing and public
debt is low at 13 percent of GDP.
The balance of payments position has strengthened in recent years. The external current
account swung into surplus in FY2003 and improved further in FY2005 on account of improved
tourism and fish exports, and lower capital imports. Higher tourism receipts partially offset the
impact of higher oil prices on the current account.
Banking sector reform has progressed slowly since it was initiated in 2001. Palau’s large
financial sector relative to its size consists of four foreign branches of commercial banks, four
domestically chartered banks, five insurance companies, a number of credit unions, and some
twelve remittance companies. Risks are mitigated by the dominant role of U.S.-based banks
that hold the majority of deposits, and overall bank profitability is reported to have improved
although banking statistics are lacking. Five financial laws were introduced in 2001 that allowed
for establishment of the Financial Institutions Commission (FIC) to supervise banks and the
Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) to investigate suspicious transactions. However, existing
legislation does not allow FIC to issue regulations and both FIC and FIU do not have adequate
resources to fulfill their duties.
Private sector activity has contributed to recent growth. A larger share of foreign-financed
projects are undertaken by local firms and tourism-related infrastructure has been improving,
albeit from a low base. Palau ranks highly in several indicators of the cost of doing business.
Although foreign direct investment reached an estimated 13 percent of GDP in FY2005, a
number of investment impediments remain. Investment is restricted to specific activities, about
half of available land lots do not yet have title and cannot be used to secure loans,
non-transparent investment regulations benefit few citizens, and labor regulations raise costs in
the context of shortage of skilled Palauan labor.
Economic prospects in the near term remain upbeat but are uncertain in the longer term.
Tourism will continue to be a main source of near-term growth while ongoing externally financed
large infrastructure projects will support construction and other services. However, longer-term
prospects depend on the direction of government’s economic policies and whether the
U.S. Compact is renewed beyond 2009.

-3Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the improved economic performance and disciplined policies
over the past two years. They commended the authorities for the judicious management of
foreign aid focused on infrastructure building and strengthening of human capital, and for the
success in reducing public sector spending in line with the government’s Management Action
Plan of 2001.
Looking ahead, Directors noted that a renewal of U.S. Compact grants beyond 2009 was
uncertain and cautioned against postponing fiscal adjustment and structural reforms until after a
decision is made on future grants. In view of this uncertainty, they encouraged the authorities to
target a pace of fiscal consolidation consistent with a gradual decline in future grants to reduce
the risk of social strains from a sharp and sudden adjustment.
Directors endorsed the government’s long-term objective of covering current spending from
domestic revenue generation, but saw a need for greater expenditure containment to achieve
this goal, particularly on goods and services. Over the medium term, downsizing the public
sector, including through maintaining the hiring freeze and outsourcing services, would help
reduce spending to a sustainable level. Directors also encouraged further strengthening of tax
collection efforts and eliminating exemptions in the near term, and later considering a
comprehensive overhaul of the tax system centered on a non-cascading consumption tax, and
a more efficient and broader-based corporate and personal income tax.
Directors supported the continued use of the U.S. dollar as the domestic currency and the
maintenance of an open trade regime. They agreed that the exchange rate regime provides an
appropriate nominal anchor, and emphasized that a continuation of cautious fiscal and wage
policies would help preserve external competitiveness in the context of an open trade regime.
Directors stressed the importance of adequately regulating and supervising Palau’s relatively
large financial system. They noted that the Financial Institutions Commission (FIC) lacks
sufficient authority or resources to issue regulations and exercise effective supervisory
oversight. They urged the authorities to pass the necessary amendments to the Financial
Institutions Act and anti-money laundering legislation, and to ensure adequate authority, budget,
and staffing of the FIC and the Financial Intelligence Unit. Directors also welcomed ongoing
efforts to strengthen the National Development Bank of Palau.
Directors underscored the need to improve the investment climate and labor and land policies to
establish a sound foundation for sustained growth. They welcomed progress made on land
titling and leasing and were encouraged by the ongoing debate over reducing investment
restrictions. Directors cautioned against raising the minimum wage in order to safeguard
employment opportunities for Palauans.
Directors encouraged the authorities to improve the coverage, reliability, and timeliness of
national accounts and banking statistics and supported the authorities’ request for more
technical assistance in these areas.

Key Points
•

Disciplined policies and the progress in the implementation of reforms have contributed
to the favorable economic performance. Fiscal soundness will help preserve
macroeconomic stability and prepare the economy for potentially-substantial fiscal
adjustments over the medium term.

•

Robust and sustainable growth will require more meaningful advances in structural
reforms. Going forward, the authorities are committed to a broad range of reform
initiatives that will raise the economy’s growth potential, including through the
promotion of a more business-friendly environment and the strengthening of the
financial system.

Our authorities thank the staff for the productive and collegial exchange of views during the
Article IV mission and for the well-written report, which provides a concise and balanced
account of the economy’s performance. The report, together with the paper on selected
issues, also give a fair summary of the many challenges Palau faces, and the policy advice
they contain are well appreciated by the authorities. Engagement with the Fund has helped
strengthen the macroeconomic framework, anchor policy formulation and implementation,
and guide the reform process.
As an independent sovereign country, Palau has a young history. However, its culture and
traditions date back centuries. This particular blend of democratic and local institutions is
behind the country’s vibrancy. Together with other characteristics typical to many small
island states, this has influenced the reform path chosen by the authorities. The theme that
resonates in the authorities’ development agenda is sustainable economic growth, with the
central challenge being one of carefully managing the balance between economic openness
and growth, on the one hand, and preserving the country’s environmental and cultural assets
on the other hand.
Palau is nearing a crossroad, with the approach of 2009 when important decisions regarding
the financial provisions of the Compact of Free Association with the United States will have
to be made, and Palau’s capacity to manage the fiscal adjustments required under conditions
of reduced reliance on foreign assistance and public sector-led growth will be tested. Palau’s
transformation into a self-reliant economy is based on a roadmap that is aligned with the
country’s economic, social and institutional priorities and requirements. A central feature of
this strategic blueprint, known as the Management Action Plan, is its recognition of the need
to develop a dynamic private sector that could take over the reins of growth.

-2Economic transformation carries with it new challenges, many with important social
implications. Given Palau’s highly-regarded community structure, our authorities have
exerted considerable efforts to consult extensively with stakeholders, including legislators
and traditional chiefs, on the direction of economic reform. This consultative process is key
to galvanizing popular support that will ensure lasting reforms. Consistent with their
commitment to transparency, the authorities have consented to the publication of the staff
report and related papers. They hope that this will bring key developmental issues to the
public’s attention, invite public debate and lead to a better understanding, as well as promote
ownership, of the reform agenda. Our authorities are also well aware that achieving
sustained growth is critical to ensuring that the political dynamics facilitate the reform effort.
Our authorities are committed to preserving macroeconomic stability. Responsible
fiscal stewardship will help prepare for potentially large fiscal adjustments.
Economic growth has accelerated to over 5 percent in FY2005 on the strength of higher
tourism receipts, foreign-funded public infrastructure projects and foreign investment. With
a narrow production base, a small domestic market and its isolation from major economic
centers, diversification away from public sector-led activities has been quite challenging.
There has been of late steady private sector growth driven by tourism and allied activities
such as domestic trade, and the small commercial fishing industry. Looking ahead, mediumterm growth is expected to proceed at a solid pace on the back of the authorities’ continued
commitment to disciplined policies and meaningful reforms.
The fiscal performance has improved, with the fiscal deficit (including grants) averaging at
under 5 percent in FY 2003-05. Fiscal discipline is key to macroeconomic stability and longterm fiscal sustainability. Palau uses the US dollar as the domestic currency and does not
have an independent monetary policy; fiscal policy, therefore, is the main lever for
macroeconomic policy. Fiscal prudence is also critical in preparing the economy for
potentially-substantial fiscal adjustments that could arise from the Compact review.
Anchoring the authorities’ resolve to fiscal conservatism is their long-term objective of
meeting current spending through domestic revenue generation. In this regard, they have
adopted measures to strengthen revenue performance and improve expenditure management.
On the revenue front, steps have been taken to enhance tax administration, including through
intensified audits and enhanced automation, and to expand the revenue base through tax
policy reform, such as the reinstatement of excises on tobacco and alcohol and the change in
the import duty base. On the expenditure front, efforts have been made to rationalize
spending and tighten budgetary controls. Right-sizing the government, including through a
hiring freeze, is integral to expenditure containment. Moreover, spending has been
prioritized toward education and health, as well as infrastructure and maintenance. Related
to the latter, the authorities have established the Public Sector Investment Program to
coordinate efforts to upgrade the country’s infrastructure, including by strengthening the
planning, prioritization, monitoring and evaluation of investments, to support growth and
diversification.

-3The authorities continue to explore innovative ways to contain the cost of public services and
make the government more efficient. Other spending controls being considered include
further rationalizing government operations (through organizational and personnel
restructuring), outsourcing of services such as maintenance and construction, and improving
accountability and productivity of expenditures through performance-based budgeting.
While firmly committed to spending restraint, the authorities are well aware that significant
funding shortfalls could arise unless additional revenue is raised. Fundamental
improvements in revenue-mobilizing capacity are needed. In this regard, they are
considering initiatives to further strengthen revenue collection through stronger monitoring
and audits, imposition of higher penalties, and continuing modernization of customs
administration. Better coordination and management of overseas development assistance are
also being pursued. Over the medium term, the authorities intend to consider further tax
policy reforms to bolster revenue, establish simple and fair rules and equitable tax burdens,
and modernize the tax system.
Consistent with the cautious fiscal stance, the authorities are committed to the settlement of
arrears and the timely payment of government bills. The authorities, who in the past have
adhered to the conservative position that loans will be taken only where a strong revenue
source exists to make repayment, also intend to avoid undertaking new loans and to build up
the level of usable reserves.
Work continues on a wide range of structural reforms that will help reorient the
economy toward private sector-led development.
The authorities continue to push the reform agenda, with a view to boosting growth, raising
productivity and competitiveness, promoting employment opportunities, and enhancing the
economy’s flexibility to handle unexpected shocks and downturns. The staff report gives a
good summary of the structural measures that the authorities have implemented and identifies
those areas where stronger action is needed. Progress on some structural reforms—
especially those in the legislative queue—has been mixed, explained in part by the need to
undertake extensive consultations to generate support for reforms. However, the Compact’s
looming review has provided fresh impetus to the need to decisively address the causal forces
that impede strong, sustainable growth.
Recognizing that the active involvement of a dynamic and competitive private sector is
critical in fortifying the foundations of the economy, the authorities continue to promote
private sector development. A strong commitment to an open trade and exchange system is
an important element of this strategy, as is stronger regional cooperation among Pacific
Island countries in order to, among other things, strengthen local capacity, mitigate the
effects of remoteness, and boost trade. The government also continues to work toward the
adoption of a new commercial code that is simple and aligned with international best
practices and that will establish consistent rules for private sector transactions. Some
progress is also being made to address the sensitive issue of land access. The government is
helping to draft a law that will enhance the collateralization of long-term leases to facilitate

-4the use of leased lands as collateral for bank loans. The government has also pushed for the
completion of land titling by early 2008.
The authorities are well aware of the need to create a stable and competitive macroeconomic
environment for domestic and foreign investment. Toward this end, the government has
been working on a regulatory framework that will establish a simple, transparent and
effective set of economic rules and provide appropriate incentives for foreign investment,
which can help expand and diversify the economic base.
Work is ongoing to develop a long-term vision for tourism and related industries. Tourism
products are being diversified, and efforts are being intensified to promote Palau in more
markets. The authorities are considering ways to reorganize the tourism management
structure within the government to clearly define responsibilities for regulation, marketing
and enforcement.
Our authorities recognize the need for a well-functioning financial system. While there have
been improvements in the supervisory and regulatory framework, they are mindful that gaps
remain in supervision and regulatory oversight because of limited enforcement capabilities
and regulatory powers. To promote the efficient intermediation of funds and management of
risks as well as ensure the health of the banking system, the authorities continue to push for
the passage of amendments to banking laws, and are working closely with legislators in this
area.
Capacity building is high on the list of the government’s priorities. The government is
committed to enhancing human resource training and development, with emphasis on
equipping Palauans with necessary skills and training that will help them become more
involved in the economy and respond to new opportunities.
Concluding remarks
Our authorities consider the current favorable economic conditions as providing a good
opportunity to pursue reforms that will enhance the economy’s competitiveness and
productivity and render it more resilient to shocks. They are also keenly aware that there are
challenges ahead, and they are committed to undertaking the sustained policy and reform
efforts that are required to meet these challenges. Many of the reforms that the authorities
are contemplating could run into capacity constraints. Our authorities put a premium on
institutional and human capacity building, as well as on addressing shortcomings in the
statistical database that have made economic assessment and informed policy formulation a
challenge. They value the support of the Fund, and request for continued strong technical
assistance in the Fund’s areas of expertise.
