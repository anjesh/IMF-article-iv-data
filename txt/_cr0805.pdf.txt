EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The 2007 consultation discussions with Qatar focused on policies to contain inflation,
reforms to encourage financial sector development, progress on the proposed Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) monetary union, and exchange rate issues in the period leading
up to its establishment.
Background
Qatar’s economic performance has been very strong for the last several years, spurred by
high oil and gas output and prices, and increased investment in infrastructure. However, high
aggregate demand growth, escalating rents owing to housing shortages, and strong growth of
monetary aggregates have contributed to double-digit inflation. A substantial correction in
stock market prices in early 2006, following two years of unprecedented increase, does not
appear to have impacted the banking system. The medium-term outlook remains very
favorable, but high inflation is a concern.
Authorities’ views
•

Inflation has been driven by supply bottlenecks, and should ease as the supply of housing
catches up with demand, and the country’s infrastructure improves.

•

The authorities remain committed to joining the GCC monetary union by 2010, but they
would like to see more discussion on issues relating to the common market, taxation
agreements, tariff agreements, and labor policy and wage differences before the adoption
of the union.

•

The authorities are committed to maintaining the peg to the U.S. dollar in the period leading
up to GCC monetary union. They also view a pegged regime as likely to be in the interest of
the GCC in the post-monetary union period. As regards the level of the exchange rate, the
authorities agreed with the staff’s analysis and conclusion that the exchange rate is in line
with fundamentals.

•

The authorities have provided data on Qatar’s International Investment Position (IIP)
position to the staff.

Staff’s recommendations
•

Given the limited scope for monetary policy, the staff recommends that if inflation
persists, the authorities should restrict increases in current outlays, including wages, and
phase the implementation of large projects to ease aggregate demand pressures.

•

The staff strongly supports a credible transition plan for implementing the single financial
market, and a formal mechanism to require the Qatar Financial Center (QFC) to report to
the Qatar Central Bank (QCB) on the financial statistics of the QFC-licensed institutions.

•

A peg is appropriate in the period leading up to the proposed monetary union, but staff
recommends a careful study for the period after the establishment of the monetary union.

•

The staff recommended, and the authorities agreed, that Qatar move to a 12-month
Article IV consultation cycle.

I. BACKGROUND AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
A. Introduction
1.
Qatar is a small, very affluent country that is developing rapidly. Endowed with
around 14 percent of the world’s natural gas proven reserves (Figure 1) and a population of
0.8 million, Qatar has one of the highest per capita incomes in the world (Figure 2). The
strong performance of the world economy and high oil and gas prices have spurred output
growth and generated sizeable fiscal and large external current account surpluses over the
last five years (Figure 3). To reduce vulnerabilities from high dependency on oil and gas
(Figure 4), the government has stepped up investment expenditure to broaden economic
diversification, particularly in oil and gas-related petrochemicals, education, financial
services, and tourism. It is also creating an enabling environment for privatization and
growth of small- and medium-size enterprises (SMEs).

2.
Qatar’s international profile is rising. In this regard, Qatar’s admission to the UN
Security Council in 2006 as a non-permanent member has helped. Also, the government,
through the Qatar Investment Authority, is pursuing strategic investments in international
markets, and investor interest in the country is growing. Standard and Poors recently
upgraded Qatar’s long-term foreign sovereign rating to AA-, from BBB in 1996, citing
strong economic prospects and acceleration of reforms. At home, the government, under the
leadership of the Emir, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani, is also pursuing gradual
political reform. Elections for 30 of the 45 members of the Majlis al-Shura (Consultative
Council), are expected to take place by end-2007; professional associations have been
licensed; unions are allowed; and a human rights committee has been in existence since
2002.
3.
Looking forward, Qatar faces the challenge of sustaining growth while
maintaining macroeconomic and financial stability. This requires appropriate policies for
managing oil and gas revenues, deepening financial markets, and developing a competitive
private sector.
B. Recent Economic Developments
4.
Qatar grew by about 10 percent in 2006 (Figure 5), driven by a strong expansion in
the production of liquefied natural gas (LNG), as well as in construction and financial
services. Inflation reached 12 percent in 2006 and rose to an annualized rate of 13 percent by
mid-2007, partly reflecting supply bottlenecks.

5.
Budget revenue in FY2006/07 amounted to 42 percent of GDP, with
hydrocarbon revenue mirroring rising oil prices (Figure 6). Despite a large increase in
salaries and outlays on goods and services, the overall fiscal surplus rose from 8.6 percent to
9 percent of GDP, aided by a reduction in development expenditures, following a sharp
increase in the previous year.1 The nonhydrocarbon fiscal balance as a percent of
nonhydrocarbon GDP rose marginally to 47 percent.

In FY 2005/06, development expenditure increased by 130 percent.

6.
The current account recorded a surplus of about 31 percent of GDP in 2006.
With hydrocarbon exports growing rapidly, the trade surplus rose, despite a significant
increase in imports arising from the start of large mega projects. Outflows rose significantly,
reflecting the buildup of external assets by the government and the financial, corporate, and
household sectors. Gross official reserves of the central bank (excluding the government’s
external assets) increased by about $0.8 billion in 2006 to $5.4 billion (2.4 months of next
year’s imports of goods and services).

9
7.
Monetary conditions were
characterized by ample liquidity and
strong credit growth (Figures 7a and
7b). Broad money growth, which
averaged 9 percent a year during
2001–03, jumped to about 40 percent a
year in 2005–06, fueled by large
foreign exchange inflows, high public
outlays, and rapid credit to the private
sector, particularly for housing and
consumption purposes. As of end-June
2007, annualized credit growth had
surged to 60 percent. This growth in
credit has led to a marked increase in
commercial banks’ total assets and in
their profitability, which was among
the highest in the region. With the
Qatari rial pegged to the U.S. dollar
and complete capital mobility, nominal
interest rates in the domestic market
have tracked U.S. interest rates
closely. However, stable U.S. rates and
rising inflation have resulted in real
interest rates becoming increasingly
negative.

grown, however, because lending
for infrastructure and construction projects is of a long-term nature, while the average
maturity of deposits is only 3 months. At the same time, banks have been putting into place
risk management frameworks to implement Basle II during 2007.

The large drop in 2006 reflects a change in the calculation-methodology and a sharp increase in assets.

Equity markets remained volatile (Figure 8). The Doha Securities Market (DSM)
index experienced a significant correction in 2006, partially reversing a 70 percent increase
experienced in 2005. By October 23, 2007, the index had increased by 25 percent compared
with end-December 2006. Recent developments in global financial markets have had limited
impact on the equity market (or broader financial system), reflecting strong economic
fundamentals, enhanced regulation, and little exposure to the U.S. subprime instruments.

C. Outlook and Risks
10.
Qatar’s macroeconomic performance is estimated to have been strong in 2007,
supported by high oil and gas prices and ongoing investments, but inflation remains high at
about 12 percent. The external current account surplus is projected at 33 percent of GDP,
despite strong import growth (30 percent), mainly for investment projects. Both the
government and commercial banks are expected to continue accumulating external assets,
and the gross reserves of the QCB are projected to increase further by $1.1 billion, to
$6.5 billion by year’s end.
11.
The FY2007/08 budget3 envisages a surplus of QR 6.7 billion (2.6 percent of staffestimated GDP), based on a conservative oil price assumption of $40 per barrel (pb), and a
1.3 percent decline in expenditure relative to the FY2006/07 outcome. Assuming an oil price

11
of $67 pb4 and higher-than-budgeted expenditure (by 7 percent of GDP), staff projects that the
fiscal surplus would increase further to 11.5 percent of GDP in FY2007/08. The authorities
view the conservative oil price used in the budget as helping to moderate expenditure requests
during the budget preparation stage; however, they have typically allowed actual expenditure
to be higher than budgeted when revenue exceeds the initial forecast.5
12.
Broad money is projected to grow by about 43 percent in 2007, reflecting large
increases in net foreign assets of the banking system and increased credit to finance private
and public investments. The banking system is well-capitalized, but could be vulnerable to
real estate price corrections in light of the continuing growth in credit to the private sector
(estimated at 50 percent in 2007).
13.
Qatar’s medium-term (2008–12) outlook is very favorable. Real GDP growth is
projected to average over 12 percent a year through 2012, but the outcome depends on
maintaining financial and macroeconomic stability. The main drivers of growth are expected to
be oil and gas, petrochemicals, other petroleum products (such as gas-to-liquids (GTLs))
(Box 1), and financial and education services. Strong revenue growth from sharply increasing
hydrocarbon receipts will help maintain fiscal surpluses of 15 percent of GDP, on average.
Under this scenario, the nonhydrocarbon fiscal deficit as a percent of nonhydrocarbon GDP is
projected to decline gradually to 15 percent by FY2012/2013.6 However, the total external debt,
which had declined to 57 percent of GDP in 2006, is projected to increase to 77 percent of GDP
by 2012, owing to increased borrowing associated with investment projects.

4

September 2007 World Economic Outlook projections adjusted for Qatar’s pricing differential.

5

The actual outcome for FY2006/07 exceeded budgeted expenditures by about 6 percent of GDP.

6

The corresponding ratio to GDP is 6 percent.

Box. 1. Hydrocarbon Sector Developments
1. Endowed with 14 percent of the
world’s reserves, Qatar has the third
largest reserves of natural gas in the
world, after Russia and Iran. While
some natural gas is used domestically to
generate electricity and as feedstock for
the petrochemical industry, most of
Qatar’s natural gas is exported in the
form of LNG.

2. Production of LNG started in the
late 1990s, and by 2006 Qatar had overtaken Indonesia as the largest exporter in the
world. Most of Qatar’s current exports of LNG are destined to China, India, Korea, and Japan.
State-owned Qatar Petroleum (QP), through its subsidiaries QatarGas and RasGas, has firm
investment plans to further develop the offshore North field, where almost all of Qatar’s gas
reserves are located. Total investments of over $80 billion in the gas sector will result in a
tripling of LNG exports over the next five years, with most of the additional export capacity
aimed at servicing the European and U.S. markets.

3. Qatar is a mature producer of oil. All areas of the country have already been explored
and the known fields (one onshore and eight offshore) are under production. Three of the nine
oil fields are operated by QP while the rest are partner-operated by international oil companies.
Oil production capacity is expected to peak Expected Investment Projects in Hydrocarbon Sector, 2007–12

4. In addition to LNG, other products
extracted from gas fields include butane,
propane, and condensates. Exports of
condensates are projected to increase
sharply, further reducing the reliance of
exports on crude oil. QP is also investing
into higher value-added downstream and
petrochemical projects. Production of lowsulfur diesels through GTLs technology
started in 2007. Qatar concentrates the bulk
of planned global investments in this area.

Downside risks to this outlook include lower oil prices (resulting in lower current
account surpluses) and shortfalls in gas production (leading to lower growth) (Figures 9a and
9b), continued high inflation, and a deterioration of the security situation in the Gulf region.
Containing inflation over the medium term calls for restraint in current expenditures and the
phasing of development expenditures as part of a well-designed fiscal policy, and for
continuing efforts to address problems related to supply-side bottlenecks, especially housing
shortages.

II. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
15.
The consultation discussions focused on (a) policies to contain inflation while
keeping growth at a sustainable level; (b) reforms to encourage financial sector development
while ensuring adequate risk management and regulatory oversight; (c) progress on the
proposed GCC monetary union; (d) exchange rate issues in the period leading up to the
monetary union; and (e) provision of IIP data to the Fund.

14
A. Inflation
16.
As of June 2007, annualized inflation was estimated to have risen to 13 percent,
compared with 12 percent during 2006. Contributing factors in 2006 included high
aggregate demand growth and sharp increases in rents (Figure 10) associated with the
growing population (mainly expatriates to implement investment projects),7 increases in
domestic fuel prices, the expansionary fiscal policy, and, to a lesser extent, the depreciation
of the U.S. dollar against the

The authorities view the increase in inflation as temporary, and driven by supply
bottlenecks. They expect it to subside as the supply of the housing increases. Further, the
authorities see an increase in fiscal expenditure on infrastructure and housing as necessary to
build capacity and reduce inflation in the future.
B. Financial Sector Development
18.
The May 2007 FSAP mission noted that the authorities had taken steps to develop
the financial services industry and its regulatory structure. In 2005, the authorities created
an on-shore parallel financial system—the QFC—with its own legal framework, to offer
global financial institutions a familiar regulatory and supervisory environment to conduct the
full range of financial services needed in a fast-growing economy. The view was that the
financial system needed to develop in order to accommodate the financing needs required to
increase infrastructure investment over the medium term.
19.
In the Spring of 2007, the authorities adopted a vision of a single financial
market with a unified financial services regulatory authority, capable of providing
accessible and harmonized financial products and services. A unified independent
financial services regulatory body, which will consist of the QFC Regulatory Authority

1991–99.

15
(QFCRA), the QCB’s banking supervision department, and the Doha Stock Market (DSM)
regulator, is scheduled to begin operations as of early 2008. This regulatory body will have a
broad range of powers to authorize, supervise, and discipline all regulated financial
institutions, firms, and individuals.
20.
Designing a credible transition plan to implement the vision of a single financial
market will be challenging. The convergence of the two legal and regulatory systems is
expected to provide jurisdictional clarity and increase regulatory efficiency. However,
addressing the needs of the QFC and the local institutions, including capacity building for
operational convergence, could create uncertainty and risks. The authorities have embarked
on a multiyear implementation plan, setting up steering committees and contracting
experienced expatriate experts.
21.
Financial intermediation is growing, including in Islamic banking services. Bank
assets totaled 100 percent of GDP at end-2006, and credit to the private sector amounted to
41 percent of GDP at end-2006, compared with 29 percent at end-2002. At the same time, the
DSM continues to grow. At the end of 2006, 36 companies were listed on the exchange,
market capitalization was over 100 percent of GDP, and trading volume was just short of two
billion shares. The authorities are cognizant of the need to deepen the stock market further by
encouraging more listings and developing more financial instruments.
22.
An anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism
(AML/CFT) assessment was initiated by the IMF’s Legal Department in
February 2007. A draft mutual evaluation report is expected to be considered for adoption
by the MENAFATF and FATF Plenaries in April 2008 and June 2008, respectively.
Preliminary findings of the assessment suggest that Qatar has accomplished notable progress
in its AML efforts since it underwent a FATF/GCC mutual evaluation in 2002. However,
further considerable efforts will be needed to bring Qatar in line with the revised FATF
standards. Once the report is adopted, a ROSC will be circulated to the IMF and WB Boards
for information.
C. GCC Monetary Union
23.
Following the establishment of the Common External Tariff in 2003, the
GCC governments agreed to form a monetary union by 2010. A number of factors
supported monetary integration: common business cycles (high oil dependency and
currencies pegged to the U.S. dollar); exposure to similar external shocks; growing intraregional trade and factor mobility; and common socio-cultural characteristics. In May 2007,
GCC leaders reached agreement on the proposed convergence criteria for the monetary
union, and set a target date of 2008 for the full-fledged establishment of the customs union
and the common market.

16
24.
GCC countries have met most of the convergence criteria. However, as of
end-2006, inflation rates in Qatar and the

25.
Qatar remains committed to achieving a monetary union with the rest of the
GCC countries by 2010, but a number of challenges remain (Figures 12a–12d).
In addition to the inflation issue, differing oil and gas reserves and other structural
characteristics pose challenges for the use of common fiscal criteria under a monetary union.
The member countries are aware of the need to step up progress on the coordination of
monetary, exchange rate, and reserves policies; on integrating clearing and settlement
systems and common supervisory and regulatory standards; on issues relating to the
transition to a new currency (including seignorage); and on harmonizing statistical
methodologies and the collection, compilation, and dissemination of economic data.8
However, a consensus seems to be emerging that the process toward monetary union should
not be rushed, and that the target date should be extended, if necessary. In particular, the
Qatari authorities would like to see more discussion on issues relating to the common market,
taxation agreements, tariff agreements, and labor policy and wage differences before the
establishment of the monetary union.

D. Monetary and Exchange Rate Issues
26.
The authorities reiterated their commitment to maintaining a peg to the
U.S. dollar in the period leading up to the GCC monetary union. They also argued that a
pegged regime is likely to be in the interest of the GCC in the post-monetary union period,
mainly because the familiarity and credibility of the regime are important to investors. As
regards the 2007 Surveillance Decision, the authorities agreed with the staff’s analysis on the
level of the exchange rate and its conclusion that, despite large current account surpluses, the
Qatari rial is broadly in line with its equilibrium level (Box 2).
27.
With the exchange rate pegged and open capital mobility, the role of monetary
policy is mainly limited to steering short term interest rates to sustain the peg and to
manage short-term liquidity. The QCB uses the Qatar Money Market Rates (QMR)
overnight corridor to guide the average overnight interbank rate, thereby controlling interday
liquidity in the system; it also has established restrictions on bank credit and personal loans.
To help the QCB absorb liquidity more effectively, the Ministry of Finance (MoF) intends to
issue treasury securities of different maturities.

18
Box 2. Qatar’s Real Effective Exchange Rate
1. Following a short period of depreciation,
Qatar’s real effective exchange rate (REER)
appreciated by 16 percent during 2004–06. The
depreciation during 2001–04 reflected relatively low
domestic inflation and the depreciation of the
U.S. dollar against the Euro. Since then, the
appreciation of the REER has been mainly owing to
rising inflation fuelled by strong domestic demand.
Since 2003, oil prices have doubled, with the sharp
improvement in Qatar’s terms-of-trade (TOT)
suggesting that the underlying equilibrium real
exchange rate should be more appreciated than that
before the oil price increase. The question is whether
the observed real appreciation is in line with the
appreciation of the equilibrium exchange rate
resulting from the improvement in the TOT.

the recent appreciation correcting a moderate undervaluation.

positive current account norms since they need to sustain large
savings for future generations and as insurance against oil
price fluctuations. However, the large surplus in Qatar is a transitional phenomenon since it is envisaged
to fall below the estimated norm beginning in 2009, due to an acceleration of imports associated with
firm investment plans. However, these results should be interpreted cautiously, given that estimates of
current account norms are subject to large margins of error, especially in oil-producing countries.
Moreover, the estimates are sensitive to prospective developments in oil prices and other variables, and,
as such, the norm can change significantly over time.
4. The large and prolonged current account surpluses in Qatar reflect historically high oil prices
and the transformation of assets under the ground into financial assets, as Qatar responds to producing oil
and gas in support of orderly growth in the global economy. The government’s medium-term policies
and the current pegged exchange regime are sustainable.
________________

The variables used in the estimation of the equilibrium current account include the fiscal balance, net foreign
assets, net oil exports, real per capita GDP growth, and population growth.

19
28.
The QCB has been enhancing prudential regulation and supervision of the
banking system. Banking regulation conforms broadly with the Basel Committee’s Core
Principles; and the payments and securities settlement systems are being upgraded. In
addition, improvements to the QCB’s capacity to assess banks’ risk management practices
are ongoing, and the authorities are working on legislation on governance and transparency
(fit and proper criteria).
E. Other Structural Reforms
29.
The authorities are of the view that broadening the non-oil revenue base is
important to reduce the economy’s heavy dependence on the hydrocarbon sector. The
existing tax system of Qatar is characterized by a narrow income tax base and the absence of
a consumption tax. The authorities are planning to lower the corporate income tax rate for
foreign companies from 35 to 12 percent to attract foreign investors. At the same time, they
are considering introducing a corporate income tax rate for national companies at a lower
rate, with a view to unifying these rates in the future and creating a level playing-field. Other
planned changes in tax legislation include introduction of a VAT, a hotel service tax, a
municipality property tax, and a reduction of exemptions under the tax holiday policy.
30.
The government is considering extending the pension plan to noncivil servants
and providing a separate plan for military personnel. The GRPA estimates that for the
current system to remain fully funded, its investment income portfolio should have a yield of
8 percent and the salaries of participants should not increase by more than 5 percent a year,
on average. While actuarial projections do not show any immediate weaknesses at this time,
a review of the current generous benefits may be needed if funding pressures emerge.
F. Economic Data and Transparency
31.
The provision of IIP data to the Fund is important to strengthen the
effectiveness of the surveillance process. In many oil exporting countries, sovereign wealth
funds (SWF) provide a channel for investing their large export receipts. Information on these
transactions could help determine how much foreign inflows are being sterilized through
outward investment of the SWF and the extent of liquidity being managed. The authorities
view the role of data in surveillance positively, and provided the requested data on Qatar’s
IIP to the staff. Qatar’s Executive Director will make the information available to the
Executive Board at the time of the Board Meeting for the 2007 Article IV Consultation.
32.
The authorities are committed to improving the quality of economic data
provided to the Fund and the general public. They recognize that a number of the
recommendations of the 2005 Multisector Statistics and General Data Dissemination
Standards (GDDS) mission, which provided a framework for the development of
macroeconomic statistics in Qatar, remain to be implemented. The authorities intend to
request further technical assistance from the Fund’s Statistics department to help formulate a

20
strategy to strengthen statistical capacity, including the compilation of the external financial
account and the development of early warning indicators.
III. STAFF APPRAISAL
33.
Historically high oil and gas prices have allowed Qatar to expand its economy at
a fast pace. The authorities have encouraged foreign investments in the oil and gas sector to
take full advantage of the favorable external environment, while at the same time
contributing to world oil market stability though increased production. Qatar’s prospects of
becoming a world leader in exports of LNG and ultra-clear fuels will facilitate the
authorities’ economic diversification objectives, creating a unique opportunity for the
expansion of the petrochemicals sector and contributing to the development of private sector
activities. Against this background, macroeconomic stability and the development of the
nonhydrocarbon sector will be crucial for maintaining the momentum for sustainable
economic growth.
34.
Containing inflation should be a priority. The authorities believe that inflationary
pressures from the shortage of housing units will ease, but the recent large increase in public
sector wages and ongoing investments in public and private sector projects suggest that
inflationary pressures are likely to remain high in 2007–08. However, the nonhydrocarbon
fiscal balance as a percent of nonhydrocarbon GDP is projected to decline over the medium
term, helping to reduce inflationary pressures. If inflation persists, the authorities should
make every effort to restrain other current outlays and phase the implementation of large
projects—in line with the absorptive capacity of the economy and medium-term priorities. At
the same time, evidence suggests that the effectiveness of a cap on housing rents is limited,
and that it should at best be viewed as a short-term temporary measure. Staff is also skeptical
about the use of a measure of (core) inflation tailored to a country’s specific circumstances.
While recent inflationary developments have been driven mainly by supply-side factors, the
choice of an appropriate measure of core inflation ought to be studied carefully, and from a
GCC-wide perspective.
35.
The authorities have already started implementing a number of the
recommendations from the 2007 FSAP. In particular, they are moving ahead with
refinements to licensing criteria, rules on ownership and control of banks, and assessments of
country and operational risk. As regards their plans to establish a single financial market and
a unified regulator, it is important for the QCB, the MoF, and the new regulator to agree on a
tri-partite memorandum of understanding on their respective responsibilities for financial
monitoring and oversight, crisis resolution, and payment systems regulation and operation.
Challenges for the new united regulator include establishing its independence and fostering
cooperation with other institutions.
36.
While stress tests in the 2007 FSAP indicate that the financial system is robust,
the rapid rise in real estate-related lending, and bank exposure to new IPO lending

21
should continue to be monitored closely. The authorities should take advantage of the
current strong market conditions to establish procedures to address promptly any issue that
may arise as a result of increased competition in the future. Consideration may also be given
to introducing a deposit insurance scheme, with an explicit cap and risk-based premiums.
37.
Staff recommends the monitoring of total debt, possibly through a debt
monitoring unit, by collecting data and maintaining adequate regulatory oversight.
Although external borrowing by financial institutions and large corporations has picked up
significantly, external vulnerability associated with such borrowing is not at stake, given
Qatar’s large net creditor position, its borrowing for export-related activity, and the
increasing use of secured debt instruments.
38.
Appropriate conditions should be set up for developing the capital market,
including a vibrant corporate bond market. The authorities’ plans to issue treasury
securities for developing a secondary market and creating a yield curve are welcome. In this
regard, there is a need for a coordinated debt management strategy to facilitate the
forecasting and management of liquidity at the QCB. Consideration should also be given to
broaden the QCB’s market instruments by issuing central bank bills in Qatari rials for
liquidity management purposes. The availability of corporate bonds would add depth to the
financial market, allow banks to better manage their liquidity, and provide corporations with
additional instruments to match their maturities.
39.
As regards the exchange rate, the staff shares the authorities’ view that the peg
to the U.S. dollar has served Qatar well by reducing trade and financial transaction costs,
encouraging investment activities and providing a credible nominal anchor, and that it should
be maintained in the transition to the GCC monetary union. Nonetheless, the exchange rate
regime (and the exchange rate level at which Qatar enters the single currency arrangement)
should be reviewed carefully at the time of establishing the monetary union. Diversification
away from oil and shifts in the distribution of international financial assets may lessen the
need for a continuing focus on the U.S. dollar. Also, tightening labor markets from increased
competition among GCC states, varying fiscal policy needs, and greater integration with
international capital markets will make managing a common peg more challenging.
40.
The QCB is working toward developing its capacity for financial stability
analysis and reporting, taking into account its evolving role in a future environment where
bank supervision will be the responsibility of the single unified regulator. In this connection,
the staff welcomes the QCB’s plans to establish a statistical database to inform policy
making, develop leading macroeconomic indicators, and design early warning systems. The
Fund could provide technical assistance in this area.
41.
In the interim, a formal mechanism should be put in place for the QFC to report
to the QCB on the financial situation of QFC-licensed institutions. Moreover, as the

22
scope of financial transactions increases, it will be necessary to incorporate data from all
relevant institutions into Qatar’s monetary and financial statistics.
42.
As discussed with the authorities, it is recommended that the next Article IV
discussions with Qatar take place within a 12-month cycle, instead of 24 months.
Reasons for shortening the Article IV cycle include (a) the strategic importance of Qatar’s
gas reserves; (b) the benefits derived from a more frequent policy dialogue; (c) more
synchronized discussions on GCC monetary union issues (especially in the period leading
to 2010); and (d) a better monitoring of financial sector developments, particularly in view of
the establishment of new financial centers in the region.

Labor Market Strategy (LMS)

The World Bank conducted a labor market survey to help identify the main characteristics of
the labor market in Qatar, and prepared an LMS that included an assessment and analysis of
the labor force and a review of labor laws, regulations, and other institutional factors
affecting labor allocation and utilization. The results of the LMS study were presented at a
national symposium in April 9, 2006. Currently, the Bank is assisting in the implementation
of the study’s action plan.

•

Moving Qatar Towards a Knowledge-Based Economy

ANNEX III. QATAR: STATISTICAL ISSUES
Data reporting
Economic data are broadly adequate for surveillance, but there is substantial scope for
improving their frequency, timeliness, and coverage.
The Central Statistical Office was integrated into the Planning Council in 1998, in order to
give it a sharper focus on data coordination and compilation.1 Following technical assistance
from the Fund, the timeliness and quality of monetary statistics have improved. The
improvements include a better classification of the government sector and regular publication
of analytical accounts of banks. Some steps have been taken to strengthen the external
current account data, particularly data on trade and services, and there is an improvement in
the estimation of workers’ remittances. On national accounts, steps have been taken to
publish a wider range of aggregates, including private consumption expenditure and national
saving. In addition, detailed data on oil, gas, and medium-and long-term external debt have
been provided to the missions.
While monetary data are reported to STA on a regular basis, there are long lags in the
reporting of price indices and other real sector statistics for publication in International
Financial Statistics (IFS). Furthermore, international trade details are reported only
sporadically for publication in the Direction of Trade Statistics. Public finance data are not
reported for publication in either IFS or other Fund publications. In an April 2007 General
Data Dissemination System (GDDS) assessment, the mission was provided with 2005
balance of payments data following the international format. STA is reviewing these data for
inclusion in the IFS and BOPSY for the first time.
Data dissemination
Qatar is a GDDS participant since December 2005. The GDDS mission of April 2007
updated the GDDS Summary Table II Data Coverage, Periodicity, and Timeliness; assessed
dissemination practices relative to the requirements of the SDDS for coverage, periodicity,
and timeliness; and identified major milestones that Qatar would have to reach to graduate
from the GDDS to the SDDS. To enhance data dissemination practices, the mission assisted
the authorities in developing a National Summary Data Page (NSDP) and an Advance
Release Calendar (ARC).
Overall, the mission found that significant progress had been made since the 2005
multisector mission and that the authorities were to be commended for their dedicated work
in implementing the plan for statistical improvements over the two preceding years.
However, significant gaps in certain datasets still remain and need to be addressed.

1

Recently, a new Statistics Institute was formed, to spearhead the development of statistics in Qatar.

6
Data publications policy
While data provided to consultation missions are incorporated in Fund documents for internal
circulation, the authorities prefer the publication only of officially finalized and approved
data for the central bank balance sheet and detailed budgetary data. The website of the Qatar
Central Bank (QCB) contains some information on the real sector, fiscal sector, and the
balance of payments, but the detail is insufficient.
Sectoral data issues
National accounts and prices
National accounts statistics remain deficient. The data suffer from inadequate coverage of
enterprises and poor responses to survey questions, resulting in low quality and untimely
compilation. Sometimes data are estimated. An outdated base year (1988) compromises the
quality of constant price estimates of national accounts. The 2005 STA multisector mission
found that the national accounts, which broadly follow the recommendations of the System of
National Accounts 1968, are subject to very large revisions that cast doubts on their accuracy
and reliability. Data for oil and gas sectors are recorded with less frequency and timeliness
than should be expected. The mission recommended that a single statistical portal for these
data be instituted (which would also feed the balance of payments and foreign merchandise
trade statistics). The mission noted a lack of reliable price indices for preparing constant
price estimates. Qatar’s Statistics Department started preparations for implementing the 1993
SNA and devised a time frame for the implementation of the system, beginning with intensive
training courses to national accounts staff and other supporting bodies, and including
participation in various regional and international conventions and seminars. Within this
frame, 2001 was selected as base year. In addition, different phases for the compilation of the
accounts were identified. It was agreed that phase one should cover the compilation of
current accounts in addition to capital accounts. The main factor for this selection was the
availability of data. The subsequent stages would cover the compilation of the supply and use
table, the input-output table, and the accumulation accounts and balance sheets.
Work to compile a supply and use table is still under way. Work has started with the
compilation of national accounts at current prices from 2001–05, to be followed by the
compilation of estimates at constant prices. Preliminary estimates for quarterly 2006 GDP are
available.
Consumer price data now extend to 2003 on an annual basis. However, the index is deficient
in several ways. Prices of nonfood items are collected mainly at annual intervals, raising
questions of accuracy when prices are subject to significant fluctuations. Also, CPI weights
are based on a 1988 Household Expenditure Survey, which is outdated and probably does not
reflect current consumption patterns. No monthly CPI data are available. Updating the basket
was among the recommendations of a STA mission in 2000. It is not clear how far the
authorities have gone in their preparations for implementing these recommendations. At the
time of the multisector mission there was a lack of sufficient price indices for compiling
constant price estimates, although the CPI broadly complied with international standards.

7
The CPI has 2001 as base year, and national accounts and CPI statistics are released regularly
at the Ministry of Planning's website.
On employment data, the Department of Statistics undertakes a regular annual Survey of
Economic Activities on a representative sample of establishments to collect data on
production, intermediate consumption, labor input, value added and other characteristics. In
order to avoid extra sampling costs and duplication of efforts, the 2005 Survey of
Employment, Wages and Working hours was conducted on the same sample of
establishments selected for the 2005 Establishment Survey of Economic Activities. Detailed
employment data is available for June 2005.
Hydrocarbon sector
Detailed data on the oil and gas sectors are supplied by the ministry of energy and petroleum
and Qatar Petroleum (QP)2 at the time of the Article IV consultation discussions. In addition,
the authorities also provide information about medium-term plans for oil and gas, liquefied
natural gas (LNG) financing, and other QP-related industrial activities.
Government sector
Government budget data should be presented according to Government Finance Statistics
guidelines, including greater detail on major expenditure and non-oil revenue categories. In
addition, budget data should be rendered consistent with the data on public sector in the
monetary survey and the balance of payments. Data on financing items in the budget are not
up to date. Access to this information along with data on the budget outcome for previous
fiscal years would enhance the basis for analysis. The country has a number of—largely
commercial—public sector entities that should not be mixed with the central government
accounts. The authorities have reported annual data for 2004–06 for publication in the
Government Finance Statistics Yearbook. Monthly and quarterly data are not reported for
publication in IFS.
The April/May 2007 GDDS mission found that the MOF is giving priority to the
implementation of the recommendations of the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001
with the objective of starting the dissemination of complete annual government finance
tables.
Monetary sector
Monetary data for the QCB and commercial banks are generally timely and of high quality.
The QCB reports monetary data regularly to STA for publication in IFS on a regular monthly
basis with a lag of about three weeks. Monthly and quarterly data are also published in the
QSB. However, breakdowns of bank balance sheets as shown in the Quarterly Statistics
Bulletins are hard to align with the monetary survey without further detail.

In July 2006, Qatar participated in a regional monetary statistics seminar at GCC
headquarters in Riyadh that focused on preparation of monetary statistics in accordance with
the IMF’s Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual using the Standardized Reporting
Forms (SRFs). The SRF-based reporting is in the final stages of development..
Balance of payments
The recent GDDS assessment mission learned that following the 2005 multisector statistics
mission, the QCB made some progress in the compilation of balance of payments statistics.
The QCB has expanded the International Transactions Reporting System (ITRS) collection
forms and has recently introduced report forms for the major oil and gas companies and their
affiliates to collect data on current account and financial account transactions. In addition, the
balance of payments presentation provided to the GDDS mission for review and publication
in IFS and BOPSY conforms, for the first time, to the format of the fifth edition of the
Balance of Payments Manual. However, serious omissions remain, largely as the result of the
lack of reliable and timely source data. There is no compilation for inward or outward direct
investment, there are no portfolio investment data compiled for the nonbank sector, and
errors and omissions remain large. Moreover, official statistics seem to underestimate total
imports. Source data for government external assets are not provided to the QCB for BOP
compilation. Although an estimate for flows of government external assets based on the
budget data is included in the balance of payments, no information is provided on the
government’s stock of external assets, which makes it difficult to appraise the level of
investment income with any degree of confidence. In addition, there is an inconsistency in
coverage in flows and stocks of official reserves. In the balance of payments, flows of
official reserves include changes in stock of the QCB and an estimate for the change in stock
of the external assets of the government. However the stock of official reserves published in
IFS includes only the stock of the QCB. Progress in implementing technical assistance
recommendations has been steady but slow.
External debt
No official information is published on the amount or breakdown of external debt. However,
detailed data on the country’s medium- and long-term external debt are provided to missions
during the Article IV consultation discussions. In recent years, Qatar has issued several
international bonds and some proceeds from these borrowing were used to retire other
external debt. It is, therefore, important to improve the information flow on external debt and
its maturity profile.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
November 26, 2007
1.
This statement provides information on recent developments in Qatar that has become
available since the staff report was circulated to the Executive Board on November 7, 2007.
The new information does not change the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
The World Economic Outlook (WEO) oil price projections were revised in
November 2007, resulting in changes to staff projections for oil and gas export and fiscal
revenues. The 2007 average petroleum spot price (APSP) is now projected to average $71 a
barrel, about 4 percent higher than in the September 2007 WEO baseline. As a result, the
external current account surplus for 2007 is expected to increase by about 2 percentage points
over the projection in the staff report, to reach 35 percent of GDP (Table 1). The surplus will
remain high over the medium term. It will rise sharply in 2008 (to 43 percent of GDP) owing
to the significant increase (18 percent) in the new WEO oil price forecast, before declining
steadily afterwards to below 36 percent of GDP by 2012. The impact of the oil price increase
is not as large on the fiscal side, as only a portion of the earnings from gas exports is
reflected in the fiscal accounts. As a result, the government’s fiscal balance in 2007 is now
expected to be over 1 percentage point of GDP higher than indicated in the staff report. On
average, the overall fiscal balance for 2008–12 is projected to increase by almost
3 percentage points of GDP relative to the projections presented in the staff report.
3.
On November 1, the Qatar Central Bank followed the U.S. Federal Reserve Board's
decision of October 31, 2007 and cut its deposit facility rate by 25 basis points. Data on
inflation in the third quarter of 2007 are not yet available. The stock market continues to
recover. As of November 20, the market index has increased by 34 percent relative to
end-2006. However, it is still by 26 percent lower than the peak reached in September 2005.

On November 26, 2007, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Qatar.1
Background
Qatar’s economic performance was strong in 2006, with real GDP growing by about 10 percent
driven by increased production of liquefied natural gas, and strong activity in the construction
and financial services sectors. Inflation reached close to 12 percent in 2006, partly reflecting
supply bottlenecks. The external current account recorded a surplus of about 31 percent of
GDP, as the increase in hydrocarbon exports offset a rise in imports owing to the initiation of
large mega projects. The financial account showed large outflows, reflecting a buildup of
external assets by the government, and the financial, corporate, and household sectors. Gross
official reserves of the central bank (excluding government’s external assets) increased by
about US$0.8 billion in 2006, to US$5.4 billion by year’s end.
Notwithstanding large increases in salaries and outlays on goods and services, the overall fiscal
surplus remained at about 9 percent of GDP, as hydrocarbon revenue surged in line with oil
prices. Broad money growth was about 40 percent in both 2005 and 2006, fueled by large
foreign exchange inflows, public expenditure, and strong growth in credit to the private sector.
While the macro-prudential indicators of the banking sector remain strong, maturity mismatches
may have grown given the long-term nature of loans for infrastructure and construction projects.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
Banks have been putting into place risk management frameworks to implement Basle II
during 2007. Equity markets remained volatile in 2006, with the Doha Securities Market index
experiencing a significant correction that partially reversed the 70 percent increase experienced
in 2005.
Qatar is expected to continue to perform strongly in 2007, supported by high oil and gas prices
and ongoing investments in the gas sector. Inflation is projected to remain high at about
12 percent. The external current account surplus would be about 33 percent of GDP, and the
gross reserves of the Qatar Central Bank (QCB) and the external assets of the government and
commercial banks are expected to increase further. At about 12 percent of GDP, the fiscal
surplus would be considerably higher than budgeted, as the budget is based on conservative
assumptions of oil and gas prices. Money growth is expected to continue at a strong pace in
2007, reflecting large increases in the net foreign assets of the banking system and increased
credit to finance private and public investments.
Qatar’s medium-term outlook is very favorable, with continued strong growth expected to be
driven by the hydrocarbon sector, as well as by diversification into higher value-added
petrochemicals and financial and education services. The fiscal and external positions are
expected to remain very comfortable. Downside risks to the outlook include lower oil prices and
shortfalls in gas production, continued high inflation, and a deterioration of the security situation
in the Gulf region.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended Qatar’s strong economic performance in recent years,
characterized by impressive GDP growth, sizable fiscal and external current account surpluses,
and a robust financial sector. Historically-high oil and gas prices have allowed Qatar to increase
investment aimed at advancing economic diversification, particularly in oil and gas-related
petrochemicals, education, financial services, and tourism. Looking ahead, the authorities face
the challenge of sustaining growth while maintaining macroeconomic and financial stability,
putting in place appropriate policies for managing hydrocarbon revenues, deepening financial
markets, and developing a competitive private sector.
Directors noted that, although Qatar’s medium-term prospects are very favorable, high inflation
remains a concern and its reduction should be a priority. Most Directors were of the view that
inflationary pressures are likely to remain high in the near term even if pressures from the
shortage of housing units ease. In light of this, Directors recommended restraint in current
expenditures, and the phasing of development expenditures in line with the absorptive capacity
of the economy and Qatar’s medium-term priorities. They noted the authorities’ intention to use
caps in housing rents only as a temporary measure while substantive action is taken to address
the underlying inflationary pressures.
Directors noted that the Qatari riyal appears in line with fundamentals and that the large and
sustained current account surpluses reflect historically-high oil prices as well as higher oil
production as Qatar acts to support world oil market stability. At the same time, Directors
acknowledged the special methodological difficulties in making assessments of equilibrium

3
exchange rates for an oil-exporting economy such as Qatar facing volatile oil prices. Directors
considered that the peg to the U.S. dollar has served the economy well by anchoring monetary
conditions, and supporting the needs of a small, open, and oil-dependent economy. They noted
the authorities’ intention to maintain the peg in the period leading to the monetary union of the
countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), while keeping an open mind about the choice
of the exchange rate regime under the prospective monetary union. A few Directors suggested
that consideration be given to moving to a more flexible exchange rate regime to help curb
inflationary pressures.
Directors noted that the banking sector’s prudential indicators remain strong, and commended
the QCB for enhancing prudential regulation and supervision. They stressed the need to closely
monitor the risks arising from the rapid rise in real estate lending and banks’ exposure to new
Initial Public Offering lending. Directors supported the authorities’ plans to establish a single
financial market and a unified regulator. In this context, they encouraged the central bank, the
Ministry of Finance, and the new regulator to come to a clear understanding on their respective
responsibilities for financial monitoring and oversight, crisis resolution, and payment systems
regulation and operation. In the interim, a formal mechanism should be put in place for the
Qatar Financial Center (QFC) to report to the central bank on the financial situation of QFClicensed institutions.
Directors commended the authorities on having already started the implementation of a number
of the recommendations of the 2007 Financial Sector Assessment Program, including
refinements to licensing criteria, rules on ownership and control of banks, and assessments of
country and operational risks. They encouraged the authorities to take the additional measures
recommended to develop the capital market, and to monitor closely external borrowing
associated with investment projects, possibly through a debt-monitoring unit. Directors
welcomed the authorities’ ongoing progress in their Anti-Money Laundering/Combating
Financing of Terrorism efforts, and encouraged compliance with the revised Financial Action
Task Force standards.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ efforts to broaden the non-oil revenue base in order to
reduce Qatar’s heavy dependence on the hydrocarbon sector. Lowering the corporate income
tax rate for foreign companies and introducing a corporate income tax rate for national
companies, with a view to unifying these rates in the future, will be a step in the right direction.
Directors supported other planned changes in tax legislation, including the introduction of a
Value Added Tax in the context of a GCC-wide initiative, and a reduction of exemptions under
the tax holiday policy.
Directors commended the authorities for the provision of data on the foreign assets of the
government as an important step to strengthen the effectiveness of Fund surveillance. They
welcomed the authorities’ commitment to improve the quality of economic data and encouraged
them to use Fund technical assistance for further strengthening statistical capacity.
Given the strategic importance of Qatar’s gas reserves and to allow a more frequent policy
dialogue, more synchronized discussions on GCC monetary union issues, and a better

4
monitoring of financial sector developments, Directors agreed to move Qatar from the present
24-month Article IV consultation cycle to a 12-month cycle.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by A. Shakour Shaalan, Executive Director for Qatar
November 26, 2007
1.
The Qatari authorities greatly value the open and productive discussions held with
staff during the Article IV Consultation and FSAP missions earlier this year. They also
appreciate the constructive engagement of management and the Executive Board, and look
forward to continued dialogue with the Fund on policy and reform priorities in the period
ahead.
Recent Developments
2.
Supported by a favorable external environment and strong fundamentals, Qatar’s
solid economic performance continued in 2006. Real GDP grew by about 10 percent, with
GDP per capita increasing to US$63,000—one of the highest in the world. Equally important
is the fact that growth was broad-based, driven by a strong expansion in the production of
liquefied natural gas (LNG) as well as construction and financial services. These outcomes
are consistent with the authorities’ diversification objectives and reflect the increasing role
and dynamism of the private sector. Moreover, the fiscal and external accounts continued to
register sizable surpluses, further reinforcing Qatar’s strong net external creditor position. At
the same time, the banking sector’s prudential regulations remained strong, and the sector has
successfully withstood the significant correction in stock market prices in 2006 and the
recent global financial turbulence.
3.
Naturally, however, with the sustained dynamism of the economy outpacing supplyside response, tightening capacity constraints have fueled inflationary pressures. The rise in
inflation in 2006 was largely driven by escalating rents owing to housing shortages, in
addition to high aggregate demand growth and increases in domestic fuel prices.
Nevertheless, the authorities view this increase as temporary: with recent price pressures
mainly driven by supply side factors, inflationary pressures are expected to ease in 2008
onwards, as the supply of housing catches up with demand and the country’s infrastructure
needs, resulting from rapid GDP growth, are met.
Prospects and Policies
4.
The authorities share staff’s assessment that the medium-term outlook remains very
favorable, with continued robust growth expected to be driven by the hydrocarbon sector,
increasing diversification into higher value-added petrochemicals and expanding financial
and educational services. Strong revenue growth from sharply increasing hydrocarbon
receipts will help maintain overall fiscal surpluses of 15 percent of GDP on average. More

2
importantly, the nonhydrocarbon deficit relative to nonhydrocarbon GDP is expected to
narrow to 14.6 percent in 2012—one third its level in 2006, helping to reduce inflationary
pressures. The authorities are mindful, however, that inflation remains a main concern in the
near term, especially if allowed to persist at its current rate, and have already initiated a
number of measures to help mitigate price pressures. These include the introduction of a cap
of 10 percent on annual rent increases for a two-year period and the launching of large
infrastructure and housing projects to increase supply and expand domestic capacity. It is
worth emphasizing that the cap on rent increases is only temporary and action is underway to
address the factors underlying inflationary pressures.
5.
Over the medium term, the authorities remain committed to sustaining strong growth,
including by furthering the development of the nonhydrocarbon sector, while maintaining
macroeconomic and financial stability. The authorities will also persevere with the cautious
management of oil and gas revenues, thereby carefully balancing the objective of preserving
comfortable fiscal surpluses with the need to accommodate large scale development projects
to expand the economy’s absorptive capacity and further reinforce its fundamentals and
resilience. Moreover, upgrading the infrastructure and regulation of the financial system to
deepen financial markets and support the economic expansion remains at the center of the
authorities’ agenda.
Fiscal Developments and Reforms
6.
The fiscal position remained strong reflecting higher hydrocarbon revenue from rising
oil prices. Notwithstanding the increase in salaries and outlays on goods and services, the
overall fiscal surplus rose to above 9 percent of GDP in FY2006/07, aided by a reduction in
development expenditures. These developments were underpinned by an improvement in the
nonhydrocarbon revenue-to-nonhydrocarbon-GDP ratio that picked up by around
2 percentage points to about 15 percent. While they are mindful of the likely impact of the
recent increase in public sector wages on prices, the authorities view the increase as a form of
sharing the hydrocarbon wealth with the population at large, particularly given the current
context of buoyant oil prices. For fiscal year 2007/08, preliminary estimates point to a higher
overall surplus despite the projected increase in development expenditures. The authorities
consider an increase in fiscal expenditure on infrastructure and housing as key to expand
capacity and reduce inflation in the future, in addition to furthering economic diversification.
7.
In view of the need to reduce the economy’s dependence on the hydrocarbon sector,
the authorities remain determined to broaden the non-oil revenue base. To this end, they plan
to decrease the corporate income tax rate for foreign companies, which coupled with policies
aimed at improving the countries’ infrastructure, should help attract foreign investments in
the nonhydrocrabon sector. The authorities are also considering the introduction of a
corporate income tax rate for national companies at a lower rate, with a view to unifying
these rates in the future. In addition, the planned introduction of the VAT in the context of a
GCC-wide initiative, together with a hotel service tax, a municipality property tax, and a
reduction of exemptions, should further broaden the revenue base and provide the authorities
with more tools to implement fiscal policy.

3
Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
8.
Given complete capital mobility, monetary policy in Qatar is mainly aimed at steering
short term interest rates to sustain the currency peg and to manage short-term liquidity.
Growth in monetary aggregates remained robust in 2006 reflecting large increases in net
foreign assets of the banking system and increased credit to finance private and high-return
public investments. The authorities remain vigilant vis-à-vis these developments, particularly
the recent increase in consumer and real estate lending. It is well to note, however, that the
total size of loans continues to be consistent with the total assets of the banking sector and
remains manageable relative to the size of the economy. Moreover, the increase in credit is
facilitating financial deepening and accommodating the financing needs required to increase
infrastructure investment over the medium term. Nonetheless, to help slow down credit
growth, the Qatar Central Bank (QCB) has introduced restrictions on bank credit and
personal loans. Furthermore, the Ministry of Finance intends to issue treasury securities to
help the QCB absorb liquidity more effectively, which should also help support the
development of a secondary market.
9.
Taking advantage of the favorable external environment and the country’s strong
economic prospects, financial institutions and large corporations have increased their foreign
borrowing. External vulnerability associated with such borrowing is not a concern given that
it is geared towards export related activities and in view of the increased use of secured debt
instruments. Furthermore, external borrowing should be weighed against Qatar’s strong net
external creditor position. Nevertheless, the authorities will continue to monitor
developments in external borrowing very carefully.
10.
The authorities remain committed to the U.S. dollar peg in the transition to the GCC
monetary union in 2010. The peg has served the economy well by anchoring monetary
conditions, and has been supportive of the needs of a small, open, and oil-dependent
economy. The authorities are also of the view that the current exchange level is appropriate,
and agree with staff’s assessment outlined in Box 2 of the report. It should be underscored,
however, that the application of the 2007 Surveillance Decision to oil producing countries is
inherently difficult owing to the high volatility of oil prices and the high dependence on oil
exports. Consistent with the broader GCC strategy, the authorities remain open to discussing
all options for the common exchange rate regime under the monetary union. In this context,
they view the familiarity and credibility that would be provided by the pegged regime as
important to investors.
Financial Sector Issues
11.
The banking sector—which dominates the financial system—is benefiting from the
rapid expansion in the economy, and as confirmed by the Financial Sector Stability
Assessment, is enjoying comfortable levels of profits and capitalization. The system has
weathered the substantial correction in stock market prices in early 2006. Moreover, the
recent global credit crunch does not seem to have had an impact on the system, reflecting
strong economic fundamentals, enhanced regulation, and limited exposure to the
U.S. subprime market. Results from stress testing indicate that the system is robust and that

4
banks as a whole could withstand severe shocks. The authorities have already started the
implementation of the FSAP recommendations to upgrade the infrastructure of the financial
system and align the legal framework with best international practices. Setting up the
appropriate conditions for further developing and deepening the capital market is also a
priority.
12.
In order to rapidly develop the financial services industry to support the economic
expansion, the authorities adopted a strategy for a single Qatari financial market with a
unified financial services regulatory authority and have embarked on a multiyear plan to
implement an effective integration strategy. In this connection, the authorities fully
acknowledge the importance of designing a credible transition plan to implement their vision
while maintaining confidence in a stable legal environment.
Economic Data and Other Issues
13.
The authorities attach high priority to improving the quality of economic data and
significant steps have been taken to upgrade the statistical database through Qatar’s
participation in the GDDS and passage of the recent Statistics Law. The authorities recognize
that there is still large scope for further improving the quality of economic data. They intend
to request further technical assistance from the Statistics Department to help formulate a
strategy to strengthen statistical capacity, including the compilation of external financial
accounts and the development of early warning indicators.
14.
Finally, we would like to underscore that the authorities attach high importance to the
Fund’s advice and support and agree with staff’s recommendation that Qatar move to a 12month Article IV consultation cycle for the very same reasons elaborated by staff in the
report.
