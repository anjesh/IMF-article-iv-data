Staff Report for the 2009 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2009 Consultation with Luxembourg
Approved by Ajai Chopra and Anthony R. Boote
May 8, 2009
Executive Summary
Luxembourg faces its most severe recession since the steel crisis in the 1970s. Profitability in the
financial sector—the main driver for growth and trade—is falling rapidly, and the contraction in activity is
spreading decidedly across other key export sectors. GDP growth is projected to underperform the euro area
in 2009 and contract by 5¼ percent in real terms, followed by a moderate decline in 2010.
Resolution of home-host country issues is vital to enhance financial stability and additional regulatory
action is needed. Given the large size of the financial sector and dominant foreign ownership, any rescue
efforts in response to a systemic event would need to rely on parent banks and possibly their home
countries. However, the systemic nature of the financial crisis has called into question the longstanding
axiom that parent companies would always support their troubled subsidiaries. The authorities agree that
reaching an arrangement on burden sharing is of paramount importance, but point to likely political
obstacles. Additional regulatory action is needed to address liquidity risks, curtail leverage and strengthen
both capital and supervisory capacity.
International policy cooperation is also needed to mitigate reputational risks that may arise from a
potential run on money market funds. The investments held by these funds exceed GDP by about eight
times, therefore preventing the authorities from issuing credible guarantees on their own. Moreover, these
funds play an important role in providing liquidity to Europe’s banking sector. Any disruption would not
only undermine Luxembourg’s reputation as a well-run financial center, but could also lead to systemic
liquidity shortages in Europe. To address these risks, the authorities should pursue burden-sharing
agreements that would allow—in the case of strong redemptive pressure—the immediate issuance of a
credible multilateral guarantee. The authorities consider the prospects of such a guarantee as uncertain.
The adverse impact of the crisis on the growth outlook is partly mitigated by the authorities’ wellconceived fiscal policy response. It combines substantial fiscal stimulus, including subsidies aimed at
stabilizing employment, with the full functioning of the automatic stabilizers. Consequently, this year’s
budget is projected to swing into a deficit that is likely to exceed the Maastricht ceiling by a small margin.
Nevertheless, the increase in near-term financing requirements is not expected to call into question fiscal
sustainability, given low public sector indebtedness. Over the medium term, however, a decisive strategy is
needed to curtail rapid expenditure growth and address aging-related challenges.

opportunities abroad. Nevertheless, two of the largest foreign banks play a significant role in
the domestic market, besides the state-owned savings bank. As such, the financial sector (FS)
is the major engine of growth, the primary source of fiscal revenues, and the main reason
Luxembourg’s per capita income is highest in the euro area.
2.
The financial sector’s systemic importance extends well beyond national
boundaries. The sector’s main activity is to “upstream” liquidity from the Luxembourgbased subsidiaries to their mostly European parent groups. About half of aggregate lending
by Luxembourg banks is channeled to the international interbank market, largely in the form
of short-term financing to parent banks. The money market fund (MMF) industry—the
second largest in the EU—raises a substantial part of this liquidity. Any event that
undermines the functioning of the financial center could therefore have immediate
repercussions for Europe’s banking sector.

II. THE OUTLOOK: MACROFINANCIAL LINKAGES AND SPILLOVERS
A. Financial Crisis Weighing on Near-Term Outlook

Luxembourg’s economy is experiencing a pronounced deterioration. The FS and
closely related sectors are responsible for nearly half of value added. As the financial crisis

declined by about 4 percentage points of GDP (Table 2).
4.
The recession is deepening this year, but the authorities see the contraction as
less pronounced than staff. Three different agencies produce GDP growth projections, and
the most conservative among these, albeit dated forecasts, is showing a 1.8 percent decline in
real growth this year, followed by a brisk upturn of 2.1 percent in 2010. Given the large size
of the FS and its ongoing contraction, it is unlikely that growth in Luxembourg could
outperform that of the euro area. Staff forecasts a decline in real GDP this year of
5.3 percent, followed by a further moderate decline in 2010.

All major expenditure components of GDP are likely to be adversely affected by
the financial crisis, waning confidence, and euro area recession.
•

The FS has been a longstanding source of dynamic employment and income growth.
FS employment is likely to contract amidst global deleveraging, although the decline
may be more moderate than in other financial centers, given the more steady activities
of the IFI. Combined with a slowdown in wage growth, this would reinforce the sharp
drop in consumer confidence and curb private consumption.

The adverse effects of the crisis on business confidence are pronounced. Temporary
plant closures and output reduction in key sectors, including manufacturing and
transport, appear to have accelerated in the first quarter of this year, and point to a
likely postponement of private sector investment decisions.

6.
The risks to the outlook are dominated by developments in Europe and the
global financial system. With the thawing of the financial system still in an early stage and
some conjunctural indicators stabilizing, the risks to the outlook appear broadly balanced.
However, a further deterioration in European trade volumes would heavily weigh on
Luxembourg’s prospects, given the close integration of its export sector with the EU. At the
same time, a faster-than-expected recovery in financial markets could generate substantial
upside risk.
7.
Inflation declined sharply in late 2008 and is expected to remain low for the
foreseeable future. The partial reversal of earlier energy and food price increases lowered
inflation to negative 0.3 percent year-on-year by March 2009, one of the lowest rates within
the euro area. The pronounced decline in domestic demand is likely to curb wage demands
and limit price increases in the non-tradable sector. Inflationary expectations have been
falling rapidly, and inflation is forecast to remain low over the medium term.

B. Spillovers and the Crisis’ Adverse Effects on the Medium-Term Outlook
8.
With its large financial center, global financial developments spill over to
Luxembourg. While growth has been typically strong, it has also been volatile, given the
financial sector’s large share in output. Volatility in FS growth tends to mirror global
financial market developments and is closely correlated with the volatility of overall GDP.
Empirical analysis finds that a one percentage point increase in volatility of banking sector
income leads to 0.2 percentage point deviation from trend growth.

The global financial crisis calls into question the viability of the business model
underlying Luxembourg’s FS. Past rapid expansion of this sector was largely due to cost
and tax differentials, which Luxembourg skillfully parlayed into a considerable first mover
advantage. The financial sector has been vital to Luxembourg’s competitive position (Box 1).
However, the business model will need to adjust to the new financial architecture that
emerges in the aftermath of the crisis, and it is prudent to assume that deleveraging will
curtail the economy’s growth potential over the medium term. The authorities agreed that the
uncertainties surrounding the sector’s growth potential had risen markedly. However, they
emphasized that the diversification across the FS and the steady flow of back-office
transactions carried out by the IFI would mitigate any fallout from deleveraging.

8

Box 1. Competitiveness
The financial sector has been supporting Luxembourg’s competitive position.
•

Relative unit labor costs point to a moderate overall competitiveness advantage. This is
most pronounced in the financial sector, but is in part offset by traditional sectors,
especially manufacturing. However, there are inherent difficulties in calculating and
interpreting estimates of financial sector unit labor costs. Moreover, there is anecdotal
evidence that some firms are relocating activities, especially back-office and custodian
activities, to cheaper cost locations in the eastern part of the EU.

III. RISKS TO FINANCIAL STABILITY
10.
The close integration of the Luxembourg-based subsidiaries with their mostly
European parent groups poses a major risk to financial stability.
•

High intra-group exposures and over-reliance on wholesale funding create
appreciable liquidity risks that would materialize if the health of the European
banking sector deteriorates.

•

Banks’ thinning, though still comfortable, capitalization and relatively high leverage
are additional risks.

•

At the same time, there are systemic risks emanating from Luxembourg to the euro
area, as a result of the large volume of money market and other short-term financing
provided by the financial center to the European banking sector.
A. Intragroup Exposure and Liquidity Risks

11.
Luxembourg-based subsidiaries are closely intertwined with their parent
groups. Regulation facilitates the upstreaming of liquidity, as intragroup and interbank
lending is exempt from large exposure limits. As a result, about half of the aggregate banking
sector assets were interbank loans at end-2008, of which about two-thirds were intra-group
liabilities (Figure 1). These exposures would become a substantive source of financial sector
instability were the health of parent banks or other large banks to deteriorate. 1 At the same
time, given their focus on opportunities abroad, the impact of a potential failure of most of
the foreign-owned subsidiaries on the availability of credit to the domestic economy would
be limited. Nevertheless, following their rescue in 2008 a substantial share of Dexia and

10
BGL, two of the largest banks, remains in foreign ownership. These subsidiaries continue to
play a major role in the domestic market. 2
12.
Wholesale markets are the primary source of funding. Given their mostly
international focus, banking sector deposit taking is limited, and interbank and intra-group
loans are the single largest sources of funds. Difficulties in the international bond, interbank,
or money markets would thus have immediate repercussions for banks’ liquidity. The
authorities agreed that liquidity conditions have tightened, but underscored that private
banking and asset management activities had continued to allow most banks to raise
substantial liquidity during the crisis (Figure 2).
B. Leverage and Capitalization
13.
Capital levels appear comfortable when measured relative to risk-weighted
assets, but the use of simpler leverage ratios point to less benign conclusions. The tier 1
capital ratio has exhibited a moderate but steady decline from its peak in 2004 (Table 3).
However, more than two thirds of the banking sector exhibited a leverage ratio—defined as
the ratio of equity to the unweighted sum of assets—of less than 5 percent, a level that may
be considered as too low. 3
The tier 1 capital ratio remains comfortable overall, but has declined from its peak.

14.
The financial turmoil is weighing on banking sector profitability. Cumulative
banking sector profits declined by 17 percent year-on-year in 2008, in large part reflecting a
sharp decline in one-off revenues and falling commission income. These were in part offset
by an increase in the interest margin, as banks took advantage of high interbank rates.
Nevertheless, interest income is expected to decline this year, mainly as a result of policy
easing and normalizing interbank markets. These developments, combined with an
appreciable increase in provisions, underscore the pressures on sector-wide profitability.

15.
The relatively high leverage of parent banks calls into question how effectively
they could intervene if a subsidiary faced a shortfall in capital. The equity-to-assets ratio
suggests that subsidiaries tend to be better capitalized than their parent banks and group
leverage ratios in many instances seem low, indicating risks to capital adequacy for both
group and subsidiary banks.
Parent banks' tier 1 capital is broadly comfortable,
but the leverage ratio is relatively low.

Mortgage lending

16.
Looking ahead, Luxembourg’s economic downturn and a cooling off in the real

private sector in Luxembourg, including

weakening. Nonetheless, the default rate on residential
mortgage loans in Luxembourg remains extremely low.
C. The Importance of Money Market Funds to Euro Area Banks
17.
MMFs provide substantial funding to Europe’s banking sector (Box 2). If these
funds experience renewed redemption pressure, they would be forced to shed assets,
potentially causing serious liquidity shortages for euro area banks. Although MMFs are not a
vital source of financing for the Luxembourg economy, a potential run on Luxemburg’s
funds could jeopardize the country’s reputation as a well run financial sector.

Box 2. Money Market Funding and Euro Area Banks
Luxembourg’s hosts the second largest MMF industry in Europe, holding 340 billion euro in assets
under management (December 2008). Among these assets, claims on euro area banks were
109 billion euro, mostly in the form of securities and deposits.
Tight liquidity conditions and limited credit losses resulting from the failure of Lehman Brothers
caused serious redemption pressure on U.S. MMFs in September 2008. To avert a run on these funds
the U.S. authorities set up a liquidity facility and provided a temporary guarantee to their investors.
The concerns over U.S. MMFs spilled over to Europe, and redemption pressures on MMFs in Ireland
and Luxembourg were exacerbated in October 2008 by a guarantee from the German authorities to
provide liquidity to resident MMFs. In the case of Luxembourg, parent institutions stepped in and
provided some liquidity to their off-balance sheet funds. Although pressure eased and Luxembourg’s
funds recorded renewed inflows in November and December, they also tended to shorten the
maturity of their investments. As a result, short-term funding to euro area banks by Luxembourg’s
MMFs rose to 99 billion euro.
In contrast to the U.S. approach that provided MMFs with direct access to liquidity from the Federal

Most importantly, however, there is no mechanism in place to coordinate a European guarantee to
stem a potential run on MMFs.

IV. THE RESPONSE TO THE CRISIS
A. Policy Action
18.
The authorities’ response to the crisis has so far been ad hoc. When the European
financial services conglomerate Fortis and Dexia bank experienced a severe loss of investor
confidence in the fall of 2008, the Luxembourg authorities joined the rescue efforts of other
host and home country authorities. The subsidiaries of Dexia and Fortis were the largest and
third largest banks in Luxembourg in 2007, and the authorities contributed 2.9 billion euro,
8 percent of GDP, in capital to support them. Moreover, a one-year guarantee for over
4.5 billion euro was issued in support of Dexia’s funding. These measures appear to have
restored confidence in the subsidiaries. The authorities also intervened in three insolvent
Icelandic banks.
19.
Under an EU-wide initiative, the limit on deposit insurance (DI) was raised
fivefold. Effective January 1, 2009 the DI limit increased to 100,000 euro for the indefinite
future. The authorities are also revising the DI framework to address deficiencies of the
existing scheme. In particular, they are concerned about the ex post funding of the current
scheme, which obliges banks to cover the costs of an event that triggers the deposit insurance
only once this event has occurred. It is their intention that the revised scheme will be funded
on an ex-ante basis, although sufficient funding will need to be built up gradually. While the
scheme will remain private and its membership mandatory, current plans call for it to be
administered by the regulator.

14
B. Policy Implications
20.
The financial crisis has highlighted potent risks to financial stability and
pertinent international initiatives are underway to address these. The Committee of
European Banking Supervisors (CEBS) has recommendations forthcoming that would
address liquidity management and intragroup exposure issues. Additional recommendations
from the CEBS and the Basel Committee with respect to increasing capital and liquidity
buffers, improving the quality of capital, and imposing limits on leverage are under
discussion. The authorities are prepared to implement reforms in tandem with their
competitor jurisdictions.
21.
International policy coordination is needed to safeguard the stability of both the
banking sector and the money market.
•

Resolution of home-host country issues is vital to enhance financial stability.
Given the disproportionately large size of the financial sector and dominant foreign
ownership, any rescue efforts in response to a systemic event would need to rely on
parent banks and possibly their home countries. However, the systemic nature of the
financial crisis has called into question the longstanding axiom that parent companies
would always support their troubled subsidiaries. Reaching an agreement on burden
sharing is thus of paramount importance and should be pursued, even if this requires
concessions from the authorities. The authorities agree on the importance of resolving
home-host country issues and recognize the potential benefits of a proactive approach
in seeking burden sharing agreements, notwithstanding likely political obstacles to
such agreements. They also point to the importance of harmonizing the crisis
resolution framework across the EU.

•

International policy cooperation is also needed to mitigate the risk of a potential
run on MMFs. The investments held by MMFs exceed GDP by about 8 times,
therefore preventing the authorities from issuing credible guarantees on their own.
The continued flow of liquidity from Luxembourg’s financial sector, however, is
important to financial stability in the euro area and, consequently, Luxembourg’s
reputation as a well run financial center. The authorities are mindful of these risks.
They recognize the importance of international cooperation, but consider the
prospects for success as uncertain amid the heightened stress experienced in many
countries’ financial systems and, in some instances, an inward focus of policy
makers.

22.
Financial stability should also be enhanced by strengthening the prudential and
regulatory regimes. Any policy tightening, however, needs to be phased in carefully, given
the procyclical effects and the uncertain strength of banks’ balance sheets.

15
•

Improving liquidity management and mitigating risks from intra-group exposure.
While intragroup exposures are essential to banks’ business models, liquidity
management has been largely shifted to the group level, effectively exposing
subsidiaries to risks from liquidity shortages and maturity mismatches. As a result of
legal changes in 2008, the central bank assumed responsibility for macro prudential
surveillance of liquidity, while the regulator is stepping up its efforts at microprudential surveillance. Given that a one-size-fits-all liquidity requirement could be
suboptimal, these institutions are jointly developing a tighter liquidity policy that
takes due account of bank-specific circumstances. Following the development of a
qualitative framework, the authorities intend to devise a quantitative framework.
Close cooperation between these institutions will be essential to the success of this
policy initiative.

•

Raising capital buffers and setting leverage ratios. In order to curtail excessive
leverage, the authorities support the introduction of leverage ratios, and additional
Basel capital requirements. These initiatives, however, need to be coordinated on an
international level.

23.
Moreover, there is scope for strengthening supervisory capacity. Relative to the
size of banking sector assets, the resources allocated to supervision in Luxembourg remain
low by international standards, notwithstanding steady increases in recent years. Moreover,
Luxembourg’s IFI is larger than that of comparator countries, underlining the resource
constraint. Separately, heavy reliance on external auditors for on-site work will need to be
reconsidered—in light of global regulatory failures in identifying emerging risks, renewed
effort are necessary to build those skills in house. It will be crucial to have a strong on-site
supervision program aimed at identifying and managing risks.

estimated to have reduced overall 2008 revenues by 0.9 percentage point of GDP. At the
same time, current expenditure growth accelerated, in part reflecting an appreciable increase
in intermediate consumption and a further real expansion of the wage bill. The authorities
emphasized that the increase in the wage bill was related to the development of university
and research capacity and was thus in fulfillment with the objectives under the Lisbon
Strategy. Against this background, staff estimates that the budget surplus declined in 2008 to
2.6 percent of GDP (Table 4).

27.
Automatic stabilizers should be allowed to operate fully, notwithstanding a
material deterioration in this year’s budget. The authorities expect the 2009 deficit to
reach about half of staff’s forecast of 3.3 percent of GDP. These differences are in large part
due to staff’s forecast for a deeper recession and its more conservative assessment of the
revenue impact of the financial crisis. However, all agreed that automatic stabilizers should
be allowed to operate freely under either scenario.

28.
Nevertheless, over the medium and long term adjustment is necessary to foster
fiscal sustainability, which is currently threatened on a number of fronts.
•

Medium-term expenditure pressures. The wage indexation mechanism will be applied
in full again in 2010, following its partial suspension under the 2006 Tripartite
Agreement, and social transfer payments and public wage expenditures will rise
accordingly.

•

Medium-term revenue uncertainties. Global deleveraging, likely regulatory tightening
across Europe, and changes to bank secrecy and their adverse effects on
Luxembourg’s financial center will limit the revenues contributed by the single
largest sector. Moreover, although proceeding gradually, changes in EU tax
regulation are potentially curtailing the attractiveness of Luxembourg as a business
location, including the introduction of the end-user principle under the VAT directive
that will lower internet-related VAT revenues starting in 2015.

•

Long-term expenditure pressures. Far-reaching reforms of the public, pay-as-you-go
pension system remain overdue, given that substantial funding gaps continue to
threaten its long-term viability. 4
VI. STAFF APPRAISAL

29.
Ongoing financial turmoil and the first global recession in 60 years pose
daunting challenges to Luxembourg’s small open economy. The financial sector—hosting
a large number of foreign-owned subsidiary banks, Europe’s largest investment fund
industry and second largest money market industry—is fully exposed to the turmoil. Besides
financial service exports, the contraction in European demand is also weighing heavily on the
economy’s traditional export sectors. As a result, Luxembourg faces its most severe recession
since the steel crisis in the mid-1970s.
30.
Continued economic success crucially hinges on the maintenance of financial
stability. The authorities’ rescue efforts and intervention in the banking sector, while
appropriate and decisive, were also ad hoc. There remains an urgent need to enhance crisis
preparedness and devise an effective, multilateral response. Given that Luxembourg’s
financial center is testimony to Europe’s advanced financial integration, the authorities
should spearhead an initiative to develop an effective, multilateral crisis management
strategy.
•

Resolving home-host country issues and seeking burden sharing commitments. The
systemic nature of the financial crisis has called into question the longstanding axiom

19
that parent companies would always support their subsidiaries in difficulty.
Therefore, the authorities need to advance discussions with both parent companies
and home countries with the aim of achieving burden sharing commitments.
•

Addressing the risks stemming from the close integration of Luxembourg-based
subsidiaries with their parent groups. While intragroup exposures are essential to
banks’ business models, liquidity management has been largely shifted to the group
level, imposing undue risks of a liquidity shortage on subsidiaries. Addressing these
risks requires comprehensive and continuous monitoring of liquidity at the local
level; and devising a regulatory framework that embeds sufficient flexibility to take
due account of bank-specific circumstances. In this regard, the joint efforts of the
central bank and the regulator are welcome, and cooperation between these
institutions will be vital for success.

•

Reining in excessive leverage. Luxembourg’s financial center has not escaped some
of the excesses that have bedeviled the global financial system. More than half of
Luxembourg’s banking system seemed overly leveraged at end-2008, with gearing
ratios in excess of 20 times. While system-wide capital levels appear adequate, these
developments call for a further strengthening of the regulatory regime, tightening of
capital requirements, and the introduction of binding limits on leverage. However,
such steps need to be coordinated internationally, and care needs to be taken with
regard to the speed and timing these measures, in order to facilitate an orderly
adjustment of banks’ balance sheets.

•

Safeguarding Luxembourg’s reputation as a well run financial center. The continued
flow of liquidity from Luxembourg’s financial sector is important to financial
stability in the euro area and, consequently, the country’s reputation as a well run
financial center. The authorities should capitalize on this alignment of interests by
pursuing burden sharing arrangements that would allow—in case of strong
redemption pressures—the immediate issuance of a credible, multilateral guarantee to
cover those funds’ liabilities. This is also pressing as MMFs do not have direct access
to central bank liquidity. Weakened capital positions may currently limit banks’
ability to take MMFs’ assets onto their balance sheets and, therefore, the extent to
which banks can raise liquidity from the monetary authorities on behalf of their offbalance sheet MMFs. The need for a liquidity facility, therefore, should also be
further explored.

31.
Notwithstanding their adverse impact on the deficit, the fiscal stimulus package
is appropriate and the automatic stabilizers should be allowed to function fully. Public
finances are well positioned to weather the recession. Despite recent bank rescue efforts, the
public debt stock remains low by international standards, providing ample scope to finance
budget pressures over the near term. The deficit is projected to exceed the Maastricht ceiling

20
by a small margin this year, but the automatic stabilizers should be allowed to operate fully
given the precipitous economic contraction.
32.
Looking ahead, once the economy begins to emerge from recession, appreciable
efforts will be needed to enhance medium- and long-term fiscal sustainability.
•

Expenditures are rising—in spite of past fiscal adjustment undertaken, current
spending returned to buoyant growth in 2008. The planned return to full indexation of
wages and social benefits in 2010 will likely exacerbate this trend, and also hamper
efforts to improve competitiveness.

•

At the same time, uncertainties have arisen concerning the evolution of medium-term
fiscal revenues. These stem primarily from the potentially adverse impact of global
deleveraging, likely regulatory tightening in Europe, and changes to rules governing
bank secrecy and their dampening effects on the fiscal revenues raised from
Luxembourg’s financial center. Moreover, changes in EU tax regulation, including
the 2015 introduction of the end-user principle that will curtail VAT revenues, are
also a concern.

In light of these risks and uncertainties, the reintroduction of full inflation indexation of
wages and benefits should be reconsidered. Furthermore, far-reaching reforms of the public,
pay-as-you-go pension system remain overdue, and should proceed with priority, given that
substantial funding gaps continue to threaten its long-term viability.
33.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Luxembourg will be held
within 24 months.

ANNEX II. LUXEMBOURG: STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of April 21, 2009 )
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is adequate for surveillance. The Central Service for Statistics and
Economic Studies (Statec) regularly publishes a full range of economic and financial data
and provides an advance release calendar for main statistical releases at:
http://www.statistiques.public.lu/fr/calendrier/index.html.
On-line access to Statec’s databases and those of other jurisdictions is available to all users
simultaneously at the time of release through the Statistics Portal of Luxembourg.
Key publicly accessible websites for macroeconomic data and analysis are:

Ministry of Finance..............................http://www.mf.public.lu/

National Accounts: Luxembourg avails itself of the SDDS special flexibility for the
timeliness of the national accounts, and generally disseminates national accounts data not
later than four months after the reference period (the SDDS timeliness requirement for the
national accounts is three months). Reduction of the reporting lag would aid surveillance.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2009 Article IV Consultation with
Luxembourg
On May 22, 2009 the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Luxembourg. 1
Background
Ongoing financial turmoil and global recession pose daunting challenges to Luxembourg’s
small open economy. The financial sector—hosting a large number of foreign-owned
subsidiary banks, Europe’s largest investment fund industry and second largest money
market industry—is fully exposed to the turmoil. Besides financial service exports, the
contraction in European demand is also weighing heavily on the economy’s other export
sectors. GDP declined by almost 1 percent in 2008, while reduced demand pressures and
the easing of commodity import prices sharply reduced inflation.
The recession is expected to deepen this year, despite some cushioning from substantial
and well-designed fiscal stimulus. Real GDP growth is forecast to decline by another 5¼
percent, amid a further contraction in the financial sector and continued weakness in
external demand. Meanwhile, the contraction in output, the full functioning of the automatic
stabilizers, combined with fiscal stimulus measures are projected to result in a budget
deficit this year marginally in excess of the Maastricht ceiling. Nevertheless, the increase in
the near-term financing requirement is not expected to call into question fiscal

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of
the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to
the country's authorities.

sustainability, given low public sector indebtedness. Price pressures should remain
subdued throughout the year.
In the current environment, the large size of the financial sector, dominant foreign
ownership, and close integration of local subsidiaries with their mostly European parent
groups have implications for financial stability. High intra-group exposures and overreliance on wholesale funding create liquidity risks that would materialize if the health of
the European banking sector were to deteriorate. Banks’ capital—though still
comfortable—is thinning, while leverage remains relatively high. At the same time, there
are systemic risks emanating from Luxembourg to the euro area, as a result of the large
volume of money market and other short-term financing provided by the financial center to
the European banking sector.
Executive Board Assessment
While Luxembourg’s economy has outperformed most of the euro area in the recent past, it
is now heavily exposed to the global crisis given its large, internationally-integrated
financial sector and strong reliance on exports. With weakening activity in the financial
system and falling export demand, output is expected to decline in excess of the euro area
average in 2009, and changes to the global and European financial architecture could
lower potential growth over the longer term.
Executive Directors emphasized that maintaining financial stability is a precondition for
continued economic success, and welcomed the authorities’ efforts to ensure the
soundness of the financial sector. They supported the recent successful interventions in
the banking sector, including the rescue of two major banks, and the initiative to improve
banks’ liquidity management. Strong cooperation between the central bank and the
regulator will be vital for success.
Many Directors stressed the importance of further enhancing crisis preparedness. In
light of the large size of the financial sector and its systemic importance, they suggested a
multilateral and cooperative approach. This would require the resolution of home-host
country banking issues, including through a proactive pursuit of burden-sharing
arrangements, that should also cover the large money market fund industry as well. In this
context, the need for a liquidity facility could be explored. A number of other Directors
were, however, of the view that current arrangements in the European Union provide an
adequate framework for cross-border cooperation on crisis management and resolution of
financial stability issues.
Directors supported the authorities’ proposed regulatory and supervisory actions to
improve financial stability by strengthening the resilience of individual institutions, and
welcomed the authorities’ request for an Financial Sector Assessment Program update.
While noting that system-wide capital levels appear adequate, they called for a further
strengthening of the regulatory regime, a tightening of capital requirements, and the
introduction of binding limits on leverage. However, Directors cautioned that such
measures need to be phased in carefully and coordinated internationally, especially at the
level of the European Union. Looking ahead, Directors noted that the financial sector will
need to adjust to the new financial architecture that emerges in the aftermath of the crisis.

3
In this context, they welcomed the authorities’ ongoing efforts to streamline the financial
services industry as well as to diversify the services sector.
Directors noted that Luxembourg’s public finances are well positioned to weather the
recession. They considered the size and scope of the authorities’ fiscal stimulus package
to be appropriate, and supported their intention to allow the automatic stabilizers to
function fully. Despite recent bank rescue efforts, the public debt stock remains low by
international standards and provides ample scope to finance budgetary pressures over the
near term. At the same time, Directors welcomed the authorities’ recognition of the need,
once recovery begins, for strong efforts to enhance medium- term fiscal sustainability, as
expenditures are rising and the evolution of medium-term fiscal revenues is uncertain.
Directors therefore advised the authorities to reconsider the planned return to full
indexation of wages and social benefits in 2010, as this could exacerbate budgetary
pressures, and also hamper efforts to improve competitiveness. Directors also stressed
that far-reaching reforms of the public, pay-as-you-go pension system remain overdue, and
should be pursed with priority, given that substantial funding gaps continue to threaten its
long-term viability.

Statement by Johann Prader, Alternate Executive Director for Luxembourg
and Dirk Mevis, Advisor to Executive Director
May 22, 2009
On behalf of the Luxembourg authorities, we thank the staff for the constructive and
fruitful discussions during the 2009 Article IV consultation mission to Luxembourg. The
current global environment is challenging for many countries. Luxembourg is no
exception. It is particularly vulnerable because of its large financial sector and strong
reliance on exports.
The Luxembourg economy is relatively well-prepared to confront the current downturn.
The general government budget recorded surpluses in 2005—2008 and the central
government and social security have accumulated sizeable reserves. In 2008, at 14.7
percent of GDP, public debt remains low by international standards. Consequently, there
is fiscal space to support the economy in this challenging environment.
At the current juncture, the authorities are focusing their efforts on ensuring the
soundness of the financial sector, and launching important infrastructure projects so as to
mitigate the adverse effects of the downturn on economic activity and employment.
Economic developments and outlook
According to the latest estimates and forecasts published on May 18, Luxembourg
experienced negative GDP growth in 2008 (-0.9 percent). In 2009, GDP is expected to
contract by 4 percent. For 2010, the Luxembourg statistical office (Statec) projects a
moderate resumption of economic growth (1.0 percent). However, risks to this outlook
remain skewed to the downside.
In 2008, employment growth held strong at 4.7 percent and even in 2009, it is expected to
remain positive at 1 percent. This may be related to effects of labor hoarding by firms due
to a scarcity of skilled labor in Luxembourg. Nevertheless, the openness of the
Luxembourg economy as evidenced by gross exports, which account for 180 percent of
GDP, leaves the country vulnerable to a drop in trade in goods and services. While
domestic demand is still strong, the sectors that are focused on exports suffer
considerably. This affects mainly the manufacturing and services sectors, including the
steel industry, automotive supplies, the plastic industry and metal construction. The
construction sector is somewhat sheltered by the infrastructure projects that the
government has implemented in the context of its stimulus package.
In order to counter these effects and help firms overcome the downturn while maintaining
their human capital, the government has expanded and relaxed the partial unemployment

2
scheme. Under this scheme, the government subsidizes wages for enterprises which
temporarily reduce their activity level. While in “normal” times, before the downturn, an
average of three firms was participating in the scheme at a given point in time, in March
2009 participation had risen to 114 firms, covering about 9000 workers. The government
is considering to expand this scheme further.
The financial sector in Luxembourg is dominated by foreign-owned banks of which a
large number are subsidiaries. The banking sector has done fairly well during most of
2008, as interest income rose because of high credit spreads. The balance sheets of banks
peaked in October 2008 and by March 2009 it had declined by roughly 5 percent.
However, most of the decline in activity has taken place in off-balance sheet activities
consisting mostly of guarantees and other commitments.
Nevertheless, besides the two large banks, Fortis and Dexia, where events in the group
forced the government – in close coordination with the authorities in the neighboring
countries – to step in to protect the domestic subsidiaries, the sector has remained quite
stable. By March 2009, employment in the banking sector had somewhat declined.
During the past few decades, developments in international financial markets have
shaped growth in Luxembourg. Therefore, any deleveraging in the global financial
industry impacts growth in Luxembourg’s financial sector. In the past, the Luxembourg
authorities have regularly adjusted the legal framework so as to create favorable business
conditions for financial players. As confirmed by international organizations, great care
has been taken to put in place sound financial regulation in line with international
standards and promoting financial stability. The so-called Luxembourg “business model”
provides a solid base for further adjustments in a post-crisis environment.
The diversity of the Luxembourg financial sector adds to its strength. Also, the
sophisticated and extensive variety of services ranging from banking to asset
management, insurance and re-insurance business and covering securitization activities,
as well as extensive legal, auditing and IT expertise will ensure that Luxembourg
maintains its place among the top international financial centers even in the future.
Apart from the financial sector, the authorities are always looking for niches to attract
new industries to Luxembourg. The recent establishment by major players in the ICT and
e-commerce field of their European headquarters in Luxembourg is an example of the
authorities’ forward-looking policies. The authorities are also working on several action
plans, including logistics and related services, biotechnology and clean energy. These
action plans encompass investments in infrastructure, research and capacity building
measures.

3
Financial sector issues
For many decades now, Luxembourg has been a well-established financial center with
close links to other financial centers within and outside the European Union. Asset
management, particularly private banking and investment funds administration, has been
a key activity of the financial center of Luxembourg. Therefore, it is not surprising that
the Luxembourg establishments of cross-border banking groups have become an
important source of funding for their groups.
In October 2008, the law of the Banque centrale du Luxembourg (BCL) was amended,
entrusting the BCL with the explicit responsibility of liquidity supervision of markets and
market operators and with the possibility to provide emergency liquidity assistance. The
BCL has recently issued a regulation that sets the framework for its liquidity supervision
in line with internationally recognized rules and standards. The Commission de
Surveillance du Secteur Financier (CSSF) is focusing on the supervision of the liquidity
of individual banks. Currently, discussions are taking place between the two institutions
to organize and coordinate their work in the area of liquidity supervision. The new legal
framework, therefore, set up the foundations of a framework for liquidity surveillance of
markets and market operators that takes on board the lessons from the current crisis, in
particular the paramount importance of liquidity risk for financial stability.
Banks in Luxembourg continue to be well capitalized. In most cases, Luxembourg
subsidiaries are better capitalized than their parent banks. While welcoming the use of
leverage ratios as an additional indicator, the authorities note that leverage ratios have to
be used with caution as their usefulness strongly depends on the business model of banks
and the kind of instruments they hold (e.g. covered bonds have high leverage but very
low risk).
The money market funds (MMF) segment has been fairly resilient during the past several
months. The turbulence following the Lehman bankruptcy triggered some redemptive
pressures which have been accommodated by the sponsoring banks. The authorities do
not see a need for issuing a general guarantee for MMFs (like the one issued in the
United States in autumn 2008), since the latter are being sponsored by banks, which in
turn have access to the liquidity facilities of the ESCB. The Luxembourg authorities
would welcome a common European definition of MMFs as well as increased
transparency requirements for MMFs.
The mandatory private deposit insurance scheme in Luxembourg has proven its
effectiveness following the failure of the Luxembourg subsidiaries of the Icelandic banks.
Even though the system is funded ex-post, banks have built up provisions amounting to
Euro 800 million. In order to foster the depositors’ confidence in the financial sector and
given the recent increase of the covered amount from euros 20,000 to 100,000, an indepth revision of the deposit guarantee scheme is under way. The main features of the

4
revision will be to turn the scheme into a publicly-run system, to introduce ex ante
funding and to reduce considerably the payout period.
The Luxembourg supervisory authorities have comprehensive experience of close
cooperation with home supervisors through regular bilateral and multilateral meetings.
Recently, this cooperation and information exchange with supervisors from other
countries (EU Member states and other countries) has intensified. The supervisory
authorities consider that colleges are a valuable tool for promoting supervisory
cooperation and welcome the changes in EU legislation that make the setting up of
colleges a legal obligation in the banking and insurance sectors.
In the context of recent international developments, in March 2009, the government
decided to adopt the OECD standards for exchange of information on request when
concluding double taxation agreements.
During the Article IV consultation mission, the authorities formally requested an update
of the 2002 FSAP exercise.
Fiscal policies
After several years of fiscal surpluses, 2009 will mark a turning point in this respect. The
stimulus package that the authorities are implementing along with declining revenues will
result in a deficit which, according to the latest Statec forecast, could reach 2.3 percent of
GDP in 2009. The difference between the staff projection of 3.2 percent of GDP and the
authorities’ projection is mainly because of the different growth assumptions and their
impact on revenues. On the expenditure side, social expenditures will weigh heavily on
the budget. The lagged impact of the business cycle on certain taxes, notably corporate
income taxes, will continue to exert pressure on public finances in 2010 and 2011.
The discretionary stimulus measures that will be implemented during 2009 and 2010 are
expected to amount to 2.4 percent of GDP. They focus mainly on employment
preservation, income redistribution, infrastructure investments, subsidies for clean energy
and energy preservation and the promotion of research. However, due to large automatic
stabilizers, the total budgetary support to the economy is even higher. The authorities are
nevertheless proceeding carefully so that the country’s sound fiscal position is not
jeopardized in the medium term.
The Luxembourg social security system provides universal coverage and generous
benefits. At the current juncture, it contributes significantly to offset the adverse impact
of the downturn in living standards and social cohesion. Due to the strong economic and
employment growth during the past couple of decades, the financial position of the social
security system is sound in the short to medium-term. However, with unchanged policies

5
and on the basis of prudent assumptions regarding future economic and employment
growth, the medium to long-term sustainability of the social security system is not
ensured. The authorities are fully aware of the sustainability risk and are engaged in a
dialogue with social partners in order to identify possible policy adjustments to improve
and ensure the sustainability of the system.
