STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
June 13, 2014

KEY ISSUES
Context. Cameroon’s macroeconomic outlook and risks have deteriorated slightly since
the Article IV consultation in 2013. Economic activity has remained strong and inflation
subdued, but the fiscal position has worsened; public debt has been rising at a less
sustainable pace; government deposits have dwindled; and payment delays have
continued. The anticipated growth path may not suffice to reach upper-middle-income
country status by 2035.
Focus of the consultation and risks. The overarching policy issue remains unchanged:
how to set Cameroon on a higher growth path, while mitigating low but growing risks to
macroeconomic stability. Spillovers from regional insecurity have become the main
exogenous risk; endogenous risks stem from rising contingent liabilities and credit
concentration. Past policy advice remains relevant.
Key policy recommendations:
 Strengthen cash management and expenditure controls to prevent a further
accumulation of payment deferrals.
 Close the financing gap in 2014, and adopt a downward path for the non-oil primary
deficit to rebuild fiscal space and preserve macroeconomic stability.
 Improve non-oil revenue by broadening the tax base and streamlining tax
exemptions.
 Reprioritize public expenditure by reducing fuel subsidies gradually; provide targeted
compensation measures for the most vulnerable.
 Increase the selectivity of investment projects and adopt a rigorous screening of the
financing terms to ensure debt sustainability.
 Pursue the resolution of three small distressed banks and support the strengthening
of regional bank and microfinance supervision.
 Promote higher and more inclusive growth through better targeted educational and
social spending, a propitious business climate, and deeper regional integration.

ROBUST GROWTH, BUT LACKING INCLUSIVENESS
Economic growth accelerated in 2013, but was not inclusive. Growth prospects hinge on a change in the
fiscal stance and a shift to a broad-based, private-sector-led development. The advent of private-sector
takeoff is hindered by unproductive spending, rising public debt, and an unpropitious business
environment.
1.
Cameroon’s growth was robust in 2013. At 5.5 percent, it was fuelled by strong performance
in the services sector and by a public investment program of more than 7 percent of GDP (Text Table 1;
Figures 1A–2, Tables 1–5 and 8–9; Selected Issues Paper—SIP—Infrastructure Road Map). The public
investment program reflects strong progress in
the commissioning of new dams and thermal

The 2013 budget did not support social policies. Fuel subsidies remained substantial at
2.8 percent of GDP in 2013, and crowded out more effective expenditure. Public spending on health
and education was significantly lower than in comparable countries (Figure 3). According to the World
Development Indicators, Ghana, Senegal, and Tanzania consistently spend more than of 5 percent of
GDP on education. The same countries allocate a minimum of 2.8 percent of GDP to spending on
health, more than twice the amount of Cameroon.

The fiscal outcome has weakened because difficult expenditure rollbacks have been
postponed and tax and tariff exemptions remain in place. The fiscal deficit, on a cash basis,
exceeded 4 percent of GDP in 2013. Total revenue increased slightly to 17.8 percent of GDP, but
masked a fall in oil revenue because of higher production costs that are slated to absorb a significant
part of the higher export proceeds (Figure 4; SIP—Fiscal Regime of the Oil Sector). Tax deductions,
special regimes, and tariff exemptions on basic foodstuffs cost more than 2.7 percent of GDP in

forgone revenue. The stock of arrears and other payment obligations rose to 4.6 percent of GDP, inter
alia because the government could not pay fuel subsidies in full (Tables 6–7).

5.
Reform inertia continued in 2013. The IMF’s advice got mixed traction (Box 1). In spite of
extensive discussions within the government and civil society, retail fuel prices remained frozen at
their 2009 level. Conversely, several technical recommendations in fiscal administration and public
financial management were implemented. The spate of nationwide elections in 2013 offers an
opportunity for economic reforms.2
6.
Growth in 2014 is projected at 5.5 percent, below the authorities’ projection of 6 percent.
Over the medium term, staff projects growth at about that same level. Growth will be driven by
growing oil production and the public investment program, expected to yield larger electricity and
natural gas supplies. Barring fuel price adjustments, inflation is slated to remain low because of stable
food prices supported by a growing supply; it would however exceed the very low inflation in the euro
area, possibly inducing declining competitiveness.
7.
The fiscal situation is projected to become increasingly fragile, as a result of recurrent
budget deficits. Revenue is projected to fall by up to 1 percentage point of GDP between 2014
and 2019, reflecting generous investment incentives,3 pervasive tariff exemptions, and weak valueadded tax (VAT) collection from ailing public enterprises. Oil revenue will decrease, because rising costs
are expected to offset growing output, with international prices trending downward. Expenditure will
drop by almost 2 percentage points of GDP by 2019, as the externally financed investment program is
scaled back. The wage bill will track GDP growth on the back of hiring trends (SIP—Public Wage Bill

Determinants). The non-oil primary deficit (NOPD) is projected to remain at 8–9 percent of non-oil
GDP, while financing gaps averaging 3 percent of GDP would persist.

IMF Staff Advice
Address the risks to the

reduction in tax and custom

Response
The fuel subsidy mechanism was not
reformed; the broad tax and custom
exemptions were not tightened;
expenditure and revenue offsets
continued unabated; and treasury
management became tenser.

Private sector-led
growth

Improve the business
climate by limiting the
administrative hindrances
identified in the Doing

Measures, such as the new
investment incentives law, add
complexity rather than simplicity to
the business environment, and raise
fiscal sustainability concerns.

Financial sector

Improve the frequency and
quality of bank supervision
by the regional supervisor,
COBAC, and strengthen the
monitoring of the
soundness of the financial
sector.

There were significant improvements
in the banking sector: the balance
sheets of two banks were
restructured and are now deemed
sound; and the COBAC, has been
more active in its supervision.
Concerns about the systemic
importance of the largest obligor
remain.

8.
The real effective exchange rate (REER) is estimated to be somewhat overvalued
(Annex I). The REER has held broadly constant since 2005, with a slight appreciation in
2005–09 offset by similar depreciation since then, in line with the depreciation of the euro relative to
the US dollar.4 Model-based estimates are consistent with the finding of the last Article IV consultation
with the CEMAC, which suggested an overvaluation of 6 to 18 percent. Cameroon’s performance in
non-price competitiveness is lagging. Encouragingly, Cameroon became compliant with the Extractive
Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) in 2013. However, its rankings under various doing business
indicators deteriorated.
9.
External debt remains sustainable, but the associated risk of distress has become
“moderate” because of the fast pace of nonconcessional debt accumulation. External financing is

currently projected to decrease as percent of GDP in the medium term. A higher sustained share of
external financing, preserving or exceeding levels observed in 2013 and expected for 2014, would
further increase this risk. The current debt burden is low, compared to that of sub-Saharan
African (SSA) peers, but it is projected to accelerate (Figure 5). High fiscal deficits together with weak
PFM, as evidenced by recurrent domestic arrears, are important factors for risk of debt distress in the
medium and long terms. The companion debt sustainability analysis (DSA) shows that another salient
threat to sustainability comes from the limited export base, which will be compounded by a relative
decline in oil production over time.

10.
There are risks to the outlook (Annex II). The spillover risks from civil strife in neighboring
countries are significant and potentially harmful to the economy. The authorities believed that
UN peacekeeping efforts—in which Cameroon participates—would help stabilize the situation.
Domestic risks include a banking sector crisis brought on by a default of a large single public borrower.
11.
Data provision to the IMF is broadly adequate for surveillance. The timeliness has
improved, but important qualitative gaps remain in fiscal, debt, and external sector information
because of lack of capacity. Information on financial operations on a commitment basis is not available,
and debt reporting on externally financed projects is neither regular nor timely.

POLICY DISCUSSION—REFORMS FOR SUSTAINABLE
AND INCLUSIVE GROWTH
The overarching economic challenge remains higher, sustainable, and more inclusive growth. Cameroon’s
ambition to become an emerging market economy by 2035 requires a faster growth rate, which in turn
requires a prompt implementation of pro-poor and pro-growth policies, and structural reforms.

A. Addressing Risks to Fiscal Sustainability
12.
The budget for 2014 targets a decline in revenue and an unrealistic retrenchment in
expenditure. Revenue projections are disappointing, as they target a fall over the 2013 outturn by
1 percentage point of GDP on account of lower oil revenue, customs and VAT receipts, and the impact
of investment incentives. Expenditure is projected to contract by 2.5 percentage points of GDP,
although it is not clear how this will be achieved. The overall budget deficit would be 2.6 percent of
GDP, and is expected to be financed by borrowing. Staff projects a deficit of 5.6 percent of GDP, based
on a current expenditure forecast in line with the 2013 outcome and higher public investment. As in
previous years, the budget incorporates only about half of the expected cost of fuel subsidies and
transfers to public enterprises, and does not include a provision for fuel subsidy arrears.
13.
The Ministry of Finance lacks the tools to weigh on fiscal sustainability. Revenue
performance remains weak compared to SSA peer countries, because of a narrow tax base5 and
generous tax exemptions. The budget does not set a clear anchor for fiscal policy, such as a downward
path for the NOPD. Loans for projects and public-private partnerships (PPPs) proceed with little oversight
by the Ministry of Finance and their financing terms are not framed in a comprehensive debt policy.
14.
Staff encouraged the authorities to follow a tighter fiscal stance in 2014 and close the
projected financing gap. The tense treasury position—illustrated by shrinking government deposits—
and the need to clear deferred payments will require a significant revenue mobilization effort. Staff
made the following recommendations to alleviate the fiscal constraints:


Adopt the NOPD as a fiscal anchor, and set a path that takes into account public investment needs
while preserving fiscal sustainability. Staff’s analysis suggests that a gradual reduction of the NOPD
from the projected 10.3 percent of non-oil GDP in 2014 to about 4 percent by 2034 would help cap
total public debt to less than 30 percent of GDP over the long term.6



Improve non-oil revenue by broadening the tax base, adjusting selected tax rates, limiting tax
exemptions, and curtailing the application of the investment incentives law. With the expected
ratification of the Economic Partnership Agreement (Box 2) and the gradual decline of oil proceeds
over the longer term, there is a need to mobilize additional revenue through: (i) lowering the
corporate income tax rate while increasing the minimum rate on the turnover tax to reduce

incentives for evasion; (ii) switching to a dual income tax approach and improving the progressivity
of the personal income tax; and (iii) lowering the VAT rate while removing the exemptions granted
in 2008 on basic foodstuffs—these exemptions have not achieved their intended social impact.
Box 2. Cameroon: Revenue Impact of the Economic Partnership Agreement
An economic partnership agreement (EPA) is being negotiated between the CEMAC and the
European Union (EU). Cameroon signed an interim EPA in 2009, which is expected to be ratified
in October 2014.1 The agreement envisages mutual trade liberalization—duty and quota-free EU
access for all exports from Cameroon and a gradual removal of duties and quotas over 15 years
on up to 80 percent of EU exports to Cameroon.2 The pace of tariff reduction varies by category of
goods (Table). The medium-term impact of the EPA is uncertain, except on government revenue,
which is reviewed below.
The short to medium-term impact on Cameroon’s revenue is expected to be modest. The
impact on tax revenue until 2020 will be negligible (less than 0.1 percent of GDP) for two reasons:
(i) the dismantling will begin in 2017 at the earliest and will affect imports that are already partly
or totally exempted or moderately taxed (capital goods under Categories I and II); and (ii) tariff
losses could be dampened in the short-term if an increase in import volumes partially offsets
reductions in tariff rates.
The long-run effects—with phasing-in over 15 years—will be more substantial under an
unchanged policy scenario. Abundant literature estimates the potential long-term revenue
impact of regional trade agreements, such as the EPA.

of the world in favor of exempted EU imports happened.
The fiscal challenge for Cameroon is to reorganize its tax base and develop alternative
forms of taxation. Some positive impacts can be expected from the EPA, such as the widening of
the tax base, as incomes rise. The long-term effect will ultimately depend on the authorities’
capacity to offset a reduction in custom revenue by receipts from other sources, such as VAT,
excises, and reductions in tax exemptions.



Strengthen tax administration by finalizing the restructuring of the network of small taxpayer
offices, creating additional medium taxpayer offices, and allocating adequate resources to
implement reforms.



Phase out of fuel subsidies gradually and reprioritize expenditure toward social services. Elaborate a
communication strategy and develop well-targeted programs to limit the impact of higher fuel prices
on the most vulnerable groups. Take preparatory steps to improve transparency, such as removing
the producer mark-up from the fuel pricing formula.7



Issue regional bonds in amounts and at a pace consistent with market absorptive capacity and the
expected growth impact of concerned projects.



Rethink the public investment program to improve its efficiency and enhance the complementarity of
a limited set of projects with a high impact on growth and poverty reduction.



Lower debt vulnerabilities by renegotiating the least concessional undisbursed loans; implement a
medium-term debt strategy in line with recommendations of joint World Bank-IMF technical
assistance, including the consolidation of the authority to contract external debt under the Minister
of Finance.



Monitor contingent liabilities from public enterprises, PPPs, and the banking system. Produce an
annual evaluation report on the financial health of all public enterprises, PPPs, and banks, and adopt
a payment plan to settle liabilities stemming from situations that have been conclusively addressed.

Authorities’ views
15.
The authorities were confident that they would be able to finance the 2014 budget. They
expected no problem in raising their targeted domestic financing through securities issues on the
regional market, as evinced by a largely oversubscribed issue in December 2013. They acknowledged that
fuel subsidies were likely to exceed their appropriation, but drew comfort from what they viewed as the
tested financing solution of cross-cancellation of mutual debts with the SONARA.
16.
The authorities agreed that current fiscal and debt policies need to be improved to
contain the risk of debt distress. They committed to improving non-oil revenue mobilization, in line
with the recommendations of recent FAD technical assistance. They recognized that fuel subsidies are
straining the budget, and supported the principle of gradual adjustments in retail prices. They agreed
that fuel subsidy reform needs to be well prepared and accompanied by appropriate mitigating
measures to preserve social peace. However, they were not in a position to provide a specific timeline
for this reform. They noted the need to improve the efficiency of public spending in infrastructure
investments and in social sectors. They agreed with the need for better analysis to inform external debt
contracting, and believed that the national public debt committee (CNDP), chaired by the Minister of
Finance, would fulfill this role. The authorities saw little merit in a strict fiscal rule anchored on the
NOPD given the large infrastructure gap.

B. Strengthening Public Financial Management
17.
Despite some progress, problems encountered in the shift to program budgeting in 2013
have not been fully resolved. The transition to new information technology (IT) systems to administer
public expenditure with better oversight of commitments and payments has not been completed. In
particular, delays in capital expenditure on 2013 appropriations have led the authorities to extend the
fiscal year by three months, which blurs the utility of the budget as a strategic financial management tool.
18.
The implementation of the development strategy has been hampered by inadequate
monitoring of, and controls over, the public investment program and its financing. Little
progress has been made in project screening, appraisal, and implementation, with a further
accumulation of arrears to private companies (e.g., VAT reimbursements). At end-2013,
nonconcessional loan agreements totaling up to 15 percent of GDP were contracted, and are disbursed
without real-time monitoring.
19.
Staff encouraged the authorities to persevere in implementing the key components of
their financial management reforms to improve the effectiveness of public spending.


Improve reliability of budgetary and accounting data and improve fiscal transparency by: (i) limiting
the reliance on exceptional procedures, such as the extension of the fiscal year—replacing it with
credit reports from one year to the next; (ii) reconciling information from different data systems by
putting in place the required IT systems to track the flow of funds throughout the expenditure chain;
(iii) respecting the single treasury account rule and avoiding spending outside normal budget
procedures; (iv) regularizing spending on an exceptional basis at the end of the fiscal year (e.g., cash
advances); (v) budgeting and reporting taxes and subsidies on a gross basis; and (vi) avoiding crosscancellations of taxes against payments due by the government.



Address the issue of domestic arrears by (i) building a multiyear plan to eliminate audited arrears;
(ii) appropriating fuel subsidies and transfers to public enterprises fully; (iii) settling past
commitments toward SONARA and oil importers through cash payments to ensure continued refined
oil product supplies.

Authorities’ views
20.
The authorities agreed that improving public financial management will be critical to
increasing the effectiveness of public expenditure. They emphasized that progress in this area
involved complex reform processes that required strong ownership at all levels to be successful,
especially in a context of a tight treasury position. They recognized the adverse impact of belated
payments on private sector activity, as companies turned to banks for costly borrowing for working
capital. They expressed hope that the resolution of obstacles to the implementation of improved IT
systems would lead to an accelerated roll-out of reforms.

C. Encouraging Private Sector-Led Growth
21.
Staff emphasized the need for reforms in the business environment to leverage the
public investment program. Staff noted that PPPs could help fill the infrastructure gap under the
right budgeting, institutional, accounting, and reporting frameworks. However, although Cameroon
became compliant with the EITI, its ranking under the Global Competitiveness Index deteriorated
marginally (by 3 places); and its ranking under the World Bank’s Doing Business indicators fell more
sharply (by 6 places). Although Cameroon’s ranking improved marginally with respect to registering
property, its rating deteriorated significantly regarding construction permits, starting a business,
getting credit, and enforcing contracts. Staff pointed out that the new investment incentives law does
not address these binding constraints on private sector activity, and may even undermine some
reforms by increasing discretion in various permitting processes. Staff encouraged the narrowing of
the scope of this law to strategic sectors and the requirement of systematic skill transfers, in exchange
for fiscal exemptions.
22.
Staff urged the authorities to rekindle regional economic integration and re-establish the
effectiveness of regional institutions in light of the new challenges to CEMAC arising from the
EPA. Challenges include a potential diversion of intra-CEMAC trade, as a result of different tariff
regimes, and a setback for the harmonization of CEMAC external tariffs.
Authorities’ views
23.
The authorities noted the need to accelerate the pace of reforms that will help the formal
private sector flourish. They were comforted by the improving execution rate of public investment,
which they saw as the backbone for future private sector development. They noted that an economic
“emergency program” being finalized would energize pubic administration and help to make new
infrastructure operational. They expressed hope that the investment incentives law would attract new
investors, and that the new public bank for small and medium enterprises (SMEs), to be launched soon,
would help to finance such enterprises.
24.
The authorities considered the ratification of the interim EPA as an important measure to
safeguard their access to European markets (50 percent of exports). They viewed the EPA as an
opportunity to strengthen their productive sectors, with financial support from the EU. They also
thought the EPA may spur a new round of regional integration within the CEMAC.

D. Enhancing Financial Intermediation for Broad-Based Growth
25.
Staff noted an improvement in the health of the banking system, which accounts for about
half of bank assets in the CEMAC. The recapitalization of two troubled banks in the past year has
reduced systemic risk, although the consolidated data veil frailty in some smaller banks that do not pose a
systemic risk (SIP—Financial System Overview). The quality of assets, underscored by a nonperforming
loan (NPL) ratio of 13.9 percent, is rather unsatisfactory; and so are provisions for NPLs, at 60 percent.
The creation of a specialized public bank to cater to SMEs poses a new NPL risk that the regional
supervisory body (COBAC) needs to monitor closely. Excessive exposure by most banks to a financially
fragile SONARA is a source of systemic concern.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

CAMEROON

26.
Staff encouraged the authorities to pursue initiatives to promote financial
intermediation. Despite a jump of almost 15 percent of credit to the private sector in 2013, financial
intermediation remains low. Given the already high level of commissions and fees, which account for
about 40 percent of the income of the banking sector, profit growth for banks is more likely to come
from transforming the prevalent high liquidity into investments. Initiatives to facilitate lending include
a pooling of data on debtors, and closer monitoring of microfinance institutions. However, little
progress has been made in enforcing contracts through the judicial system and in using real property
as collateral.
27.
Staff noted the ongoing efforts to strengthen supervision through better staffing of the
COBAC, and progress in articulating crisis prevention and resolution frameworks at the regional
level. Key objectives include a lowering of the time that a bank can spend under provisional
administration, so that decisions on restructuring or closing can be expedited; the imposition of
management guidelines stressing asset conservation; and the inclusion of the full cost of a bank’s
resolution in the budget. Staff proposed that a memorandum of understanding be drawn between the
COBAC and the Ministry of Finance to enhance information sharing and set a division of labor in
microfinance supervision.
Authorities’ views
28.
The authorities recognized the risk posed by the concentration of bank credit on ailing
public enterprises. They opined that liquidity problems of large debtors would be resolved through a
progressive clearing of government obligations. They also noted that the ongoing expansion of
SONARA’s refining capacity would improve its financial situation.
29.
The authorities committed to limiting the risks linked to the new bank for SMEs. They
pointed out the active supervision of COBAC, and added that new tools by the national branch of the
regional central bank (BEAC), such as maintaining a real-time credit registry, would help the bank to
make informed decisions.

E. Reform Scenario
30.
Staff presented a moderate reform scenario. Its main tenets are (i) a reining in of the fiscal
deficit and of the pace of debt accumulation helped by a gradual adjustment in retail fuel prices of
gasoline and diesel that would not reach full cost-recovery levels over the medium term; (ii) tax policy
reforms to reduce exemptions, adjust selected tax rates, and broaden tax bases; and (iii) an acceleration
of private sector growth from improvements in the business environment and strengthening of the anticorruption framework.

31.
The reform scenario would lead to an increase in growth by up to ½ percentage point of
GDP by 2019 (Text Table 3). Improved tax performance and more efficient public investment spending
would create fiscal space for social spending and the maintenance cost of new infrastructure. Together
with business environment reforms, these expenditure and tax policies would enhance growth, and
limit the fiscal deficit significantly over the medium term. Inflation would see a modest temporary
increase owing to the fuel price adjustments, but would remain well within single digits.

Authorities’ views
32.
The authorities found the reform scenario realistic. They accepted the need for reforms to
fiscal policy and the business environment, but were of the view that their ongoing reform efforts, at a
pace more compatible with Cameroon’s social realities, paired with the rapid implementation of the
public investment program, would yield similar results.

STAFF APPRAISAL
33.
Cameroon’s increased public investment spending has accelerated growth. The authorities
need to implement higher quality policies and improve governance to promote development. The current
level of growth, in itself, is not sufficient to accelerate poverty reduction and achieve upper-middleincome country status by 2035. A combination of reforms to enhance the cost-effectiveness of public
expenditure and to foster private sector response has become critical. Regional security risks add an
element of urgency to reforms to make the economy more resilient and to rekindle regional integration.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

CAMEROON

34.
The fiscal stance requires adjustment. Risks to the 2014 budget need to be addressed without
delay to avoid further accumulation of domestic arrears that undermine fiscal sustainability. Non-oil
revenue performance will remain tepid unless unwarranted exemptions are removed, the tax base is
broadened, and tax administration is made more effective. International oil prices and domestic demand
will keep fuel subsidies high, unless pump prices are progressively raised. Contingent liabilities in the
public and banking sectors and PPPs threaten fiscal sustainability.
35.
The envisaged ratification of the EPA could further undermine revenue in the long term. An
evaluation of its direct and indirect impacts on revenue is necessary, and could inform new discussions on
regional integration with CEMAC partner countries.
36.
Although debt remains sustainable, new external liabilities have pushed the risk of external
debt distress from “low” to “moderate.” The level of external debt remains low relative to the average
of SSA, but the pace of debt accumulation is faster, and the risk of external debt distress would be higher
still if the composition of future financing were to preserve or exceed external levels observed in 2013 and
expected for 2014, rather than gradually decreasing as currently projected. The sensitivity of external debt
sustainability to exports calls for export diversification.
37.
The projected external debt accumulation points to a need to generate more value from
public investment. A three-pronged approach is necessary: (i) a new round of project selection to
identify projects with a high impact on growth and poverty reduction, and the rolling back of nonessential projects; (ii) the integrity of public financial management needs to be strengthened, including
competitive procurement to generate more cost-effective spending; and (iii) the terms of new debt need
to be more concessional.
38.
A broad array of reforms to the business environment needs to be initiated, because its
credibility will take time to establish. The private sector needs to take over as the main engine of
growth by the time the public investment program is scaled back. The various reform areas cited by the
Doing Business indicators point to a direct link between improvements in revenue policy, public financial
management and private sector activity; they include “trading across borders” and “paying taxes.”
39.
Risks to the banking system have receded, but financial intermediation remains low. The
restructuring of two troubled banks leaves only three small banks in need of a resolution. The
microfinance sector could expand faster and with less risk with the adoption of a regulatory framework
and diligent joint supervision by COBAC and the Ministry of Finance. The new bank for SMEs is in need of
regulatory vigilance, starting with its credit policy.
40.
Staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard 12-month
cycle, in accordance with the Decision on Article IV Consultation Cycles (Decision No. 14747–(10/96)
(9/28/2010).

Historical and budget figures exclude direct taxes, customs duties, and VAT due by SONARA which were subject to cross-cancellations against fuel subsidies due
to SONARA (i.e., the revenue is presented on a net basis). From 2014 onward, projections for these taxes are made on a gross basis, except for the "adjusted
projections" column, which is presented after expected cross-cancellations, to be comparable with the budget.

Partial audits conducted in 2010 and 2012 revealed additional arrears of CFAF 18 billion and CFAF 7 billion, respectively. These are included in the end-2010
and 2012 stocks of audited arrears, respectively; this may create discrepancies in flow figures in certain years.

Historical figures exclude direct taxes, customs duties, and VAT due by SONARA which were subject to cross-cancellations against fuel
subsidies due to SONARA (i.e., the revenue is presented on a net basis). From 2014 onward, projections for these taxes are made on a gross
basis.

Figures for 2012 include securitization of fuel subsidies due to SONARA.
Rehabilitation and participation shows General Government's capital transfers.

Historical figures exclude direct taxes, customs duties, and VAT due by SONARA which were subject to cross-cancellations against fuel

basis.

Figures for 2012 include securitization of fuel subsidies due to SONARA.

Historical and budget figures exclude direct taxes, customs duties, and VAT due by SONARA, which were subject to cross-cancellations against fuel
subsidies due to SONARA (i.e., the revenue is presented on a net basis). From 2014 onward, projections for these taxes are made on a gross basis, except
for the "adjusted projections" column, which is presented after expected cross-cancellations, to be comparable with the budget.

Annex I. Cameroon: External Competitiveness
The findings of this monograph1 are consistent with the findings of the 2013 and the preliminary 2014
Central African Economic and Monetary Community’s (CEMAC) external assessment.2 Cameroon’s real
effective exchange rate, on balance, appears somewhat overvalued. Structural competitiveness also shows
weaknesses. The analysis of non-price indicators highlights the continued need for Cameroon to improve
its business climate, which implies improving infrastructure and access to financing.

Cameroon’s current account has fluctuated over the last decade, reflecting developments
in the trade balance and international commodities prices. Since 2002, the current account deficit
has averaged about 2.3 percent of GDP (Figure I.1). The only recent surpluses occurred in 2006
and 2007 because of high oil prices. Cameroon also

The external stability assessment of the CEMAC (IMF Country Report No. 13/322, 2013) found that the real effective
exchange rate (REER) was overvalued, but was within the margin of error, indicating that the REER was broadly
consistent with equilibrium under current policies, while reserves remained adequate.

Cameroon's exports, as a share of CEMAC exports, declined over the past couple of
decades (Figure I.3). In the 1990s, Cameroon used to
be the second largest exporter after Gabon. At
present, it has moved to the fourth position, despite
an increase in the openness of the economy (defined
as the sum of exports and imports divided by GDP),
behind Equatorial Guinea, the Republic of Congo,
and Gabon.

4.
The current account deficit is expected to grow from 3.9 to 4.4 percent of GDP in
2013–19. In 2013, approximately 52 percent of exports were oil and oil products. The expected
deterioration in the goods and services balance is predicated on the strong growth of imports for
investment projects. The current account deficit would primarily be financed by government
borrowing.
5.
Cameroon’s REER has depreciated since 2010, partially reversing a previous long-run

appreciation (Figure I.4). Since 2009, the REER has
(REER and NEER 1994=100)
(TOT 2005=100)
depreciated by 7.7 percent, with the nominal
effective exchange rate (NEER) closely following this
trend. This depreciation reflects the movements of
the NEER of the euro, to which the country’s currency
is pegged. However, this depreciation has not offset
fully the 24 percent REER appreciation in 1994–2008.

As a preliminary assessment, Cameroon’s current REER appears to be somewhat
overvalued. The first approach for assessing the REER is to assume that the mean of the two years
following the CFA franc’s devaluation in 1994 is the long-run effective exchange rate (LREER). Another
approach is to assume the LREER is the sample mean over the period 1994–2013. The first approach
suggests that the REER was overvalued by 9.2 percent at end-2013, while the second approach
indicates that the REER is broadly in line with
equilibrium. As noted in previous years, one
important determinant of the LREER are the terms of
trade—up by nearly 27 percent since 2009, which
indicates that the LREER may have shifted over time.
Furthermore, Cameroon’s non-oil current account
deficit has been worsening (Figure I.5), suggesting a
possible overvaluation of the REER. Accordingly, the
utility of these approaches may be limited by the
strong assumptions on the LREER made for this
preliminary assessment.

B. Model-Based Real Exchange Rate Assessments
The effective real exchange rate is assessed using the three approaches of the Consultative Group on
Exchange Rate (CGER) issues. A methodology accounting for the need for natural-resource-rich countries
to smooth consumption of resource revenue over time is also used.
7.
The REER is assessed using the three approaches of the CGER. They are: (i) the
macroeconomic balance (MB); (ii) the external sustainability (ES); and (iii) the equilibrium real exchange
rate (ERER) approaches (Figure I.6). Annual data for 184 countries for 1973–2013 are used, along with
projections from the macroeconomic framework of the 2014 Article IV consultation. The standard CGER
procedures are complemented by an adjusted ES approach that considers Cameroon’s oil wealth and the
projected exhaustion of its oil resources. The results are broadly in line with the previous assessment,3
consistent with the limited changes in Cameroon’s economic circumstances over the past year.

The MB approach calculates the difference between the current account balance
projected over the medium term at prevailing exchange rates (the “underlying current account
balance”) and an estimated equilibrium current account (also called the “current account
norm”), which is a function of economic fundamentals. The extent to which the real exchange rate
needs to adjust mostly depends on the country-specific elasticity of the current account with respect to
the real exchange rate. The current account balance elasticity to the exchange rate4 is taken from
Tokarick (2010).5

IMF Country Report No. 13/279, Appendix III, 2013.

The current account elasticity is calculated as: (export elasticity) x (export-to-GDP ratio)-(import elasticity – 1) x
(import-to-GDP ratio).

9.
The MB approach suggests the REER was overvalued by 3 to 9 percent at end-2013. The
estimated current account norm points to a deficit of 3.3 percent, while the underlying current account
deficit is about 4.5 percent. The real exchange rate would then need to eliminate this difference.
Tokarick (2010) estimates three trade balance elasticities to the real exchange rate:
CGER (-0.14); general (-0.31); and small country (-0.38). At one end, CGER elasticity is the so-called
“Keynesian Case,” where both the supply of exports and imports are assumed to be perfectly inelastic.
At the other end, the small country case assumes that export demand and import supply are perfectly
elastic, as the country is unable to affect international prices. The real exchange rate is assessed using
these three estimates of the trade balance elasticity. The more elastic the current account is, or the
more open the economy is, the less the exchange rate needs to be adjusted. The mean has drifted
downward in past assessments, from 15.4 in 2010 to 5.5 percent in 2013.
10.
Using the same elasticities, the ES approach suggests the REER was overvalued by 6 to
17 percent at end-2013. The ES approach calculates the difference between the actual current
account and the current account that would stabilize the net foreign assets (NFAs) position at some
benchmark level. The NFA-stabilizing current account is a deficit of 2.0 percent of GDP, compared to a
4.5 percent underlying current account deficit. The mean has remained between 11 and 13 percent
since the 2010 assessment, except for a dip to 8.6 percent in 2012. In the preliminary external
assessment for CEMAC in 2014, the REER was overvalued by 10.9 percent using the same approach.
11.
In contrast with the MB and ES approaches, but in line with previous assessments, the
equilibrium real exchange rate (ERER) approach suggests the REER was undervalued by 6
to 11 percent at end-2013.6 The ERER approach calculates the difference between the actual real
exchange rate and an estimated equilibrium real exchange rate, which is directly derived from the
projection of medium-term fundamentals, such as the NFAs, productivity differential between tradable
and non-tradable sectors, and the terms of trade. The range shown in Figure I.6 is determined by
calculating the standard deviation from 2010 to 2013. Since the 2010 assessment, the mean has
fluctuated between -3 and -13 percent.
12.
To complement the above analysis, the ES
approach is tailored to oil-producing countries.7
External sustainability is particularly important for
exhaustible natural-resource producers like
Cameroon. Cameroon may anticipate future
resource depletion and a decline in resource export.
In such a case, it is recommended to maintain a
foreign asset cushion in order to mitigate external
shocks, and to manage NFAs accordingly

Net Oil Exports

CAMEROON

(IMF, 2012).8 In the case of oil producers, where oil represents a relatively small share of economic
activity, like in Cameroon, it is important to also account for oil imports and to rely on net oil exports
to evaluate external sustainability. While oil exports are projected to represent close to 10 percent of
GDP in 2019, net exports are projected to represent about 5 percent of GDP by the same year
(Figure I.7). For this exercise, Cameroon’s petroleum reserves are assumed to be completely exhausted
in 20 years and the current account norm assumes that part of oil revenues are saved to provide a
constant real annuity over time.
13.
This adjusted “Bems-Carvalho” ES approach suggests the REER was overvalued by
18 percent at end-2013. The results from this method have fluctuated since the 2011 between 13 and
18 percent. The corresponding current account norm under this scenario is a 4.1 percent current
account surplus by 2019. This result, however, should be considered in light of the fact that
international capital market imperfections and urgent development needs create an argument for
countries to invest in domestic infrastructure instead of investing in domestic savings. In other words,
when external borrowing is constrained, the optimal response to a natural resource windfall implies a
smaller current account surplus than otherwise. However, investment inefficiencies and absorptive
capacity constraints imply that the ability of domestic investment is limited in acting as a domestic
savings mechanism, consequently justifying larger current account surpluses. In either case, the
transitory nature of oil revenues in Cameroon would suggest investing a larger proportion of these
revenues in safe assets with reasonable yield, be it abroad or domestically. In the preliminary external
assessment for CEMAC in 2014, the REER was overvalued 12.7 percent for this approach.
14.
Taken together, the above results indicate that, on balance, Cameroon’s REER appears
somewhat overvalued, confirming last year’s exchange rate assessment. The above results are
sensitive not only to the prevailing macroeconomic assumptions, but also to the hypotheses each
approach uses, such as the level of elasticity of the current account to the real exchange rate. All things
considered, maintaining Cameroon’s NFA position would require reducing the current account deficit
and therefore implies an overvalued REER. This argument is strengthened if Cameroon saves some of
its windfall oil revenues. From this perspective, it is important to bear in mind that the underlying
current account deficit is a function of Cameroon’s competitiveness, which is function of factors
beyond the REER. Correspondingly, improving Cameroon’s competitiveness could reduce the current
account deficit and help the country save some of its transitory petroleum revenues. The next section
assesses Cameroon’s structural competitiveness using non-price indicators.

According to the 2013–14 GCI report, Cameroon ranks 115th of 148 surveyed countries. It
has lost three places since the previous report, but maintained a score of 3.7 out of 7. Within subSaharan Africa (SSA), Cameroon ranks 12th out of 34 countries, above the region’s average and median
(Table I.1). Cameroon also obtained higher scores than the SSA average on three sub-indices: basic
requirements; efficiency enhancers and factors of innovation; and sophistication.

The report identifies the same five major constraints as last year: corruption, access to
financing, inadequate infrastructure, government bureaucracy, and tax regulations (Figure I.8).
Notably, despite the authorities’ efforts, corruption still tops the list followed by poor access to financing.
18.
Similarly, according to the Heritage Foundation, Cameroon continued to score below the
world average. Areas for improvement are freedom from corruption and the protection of property
rights, despite some marginal reforms. Cameroon’s total score improved slightly in 2013,
from 52.3 to 52.6 out of 100, reflecting gains in trade and fiscal freedom (Table I.2). In spite of this,
Cameroon slipped in the Foundation’s rankings from 133 to 136, losing three places for the second
year in a row. Cameroon’s index qualifies the economy as “mostly unfree.” Half of the ten Heritage
Foundation indicators of economic freedom deteriorated in the course of the year, including property
rights, investment freedom, and monetary freedom.

Cameroon’s business climate, as measured by the 2014 World Bank Doing Business
indicators, has deteriorated. Its rank is lower than the average for SSA (Table I.3, Figure I.9). The
country lost six places in 2014, slipping to the 168th place (out of 189). Cameroon has made it easier to
obtain a building permit by decentralizing the process and by introducing time limits, but the
notification and inspection requirements have more than offset those improvements. Although
Cameroon’s ranking has improved marginally with respect to registering property, the country’s rating
has deteriorated significantly regarding construction permits, starting a business, and getting credit.
The country’s 175th ranking with respect to enforcing contracts reflects the 800 days needed to resolve
a legal dispute versus 652 days on average in SSA (and 42 procedures to enforce a contract versus 39).
20.
Cameroon’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) score of 3.2 was in line
with SSA average and above the average of the CEMAC (2.9) in 2012 (Table I.4). Although
Cameroon’s scores in major areas exceed the scores of the CEMAC and are strong in economic
management compared with SSA, they lag SSA in policies for social inclusion. Areas for improvement
are in property rights, rule-based governance, transparency, accountability, and corruption.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely
to materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the
risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability
between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability of 30 percent of more). The RAM reflects staff views on the source
of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may
interact and materialize jointly.

committed.
Interim assistance - amount disbursed to a country during the period between decision and
completion points, up to 20 percent annually and 60 percent in total of the assistance committed
at the decision point (or 25 percent and 75 percent, respectively, in exceptional circumstances).
Completion point - point at which a country receives the remaining balance of its assistance
committed at the decision point, together with an additional disbursement of interest income as
defined in footnote 2 above. The timing of the completion point is linked to the implementation of
pre-agreed key structural reforms (i.e., floating completion point).
Implementation of Post-Catastrophe Debt Relief (PCDR): Not Applicable
Safeguards Assessments:
Consistent with the safeguards policy requirement for regional central banks, the Banque des États
d’Afrique Centrale (BEAC) was subject to a quadrennial assessment in 2013. It occurred against the
backdrop of significant change at the BEAC to address governance challenges and control failures
that emerged in 2009, and led to close engagement in the period after through close IMF monitoring
of safeguards “rolling measures” in the context of new program requests and reviews for the Central
African Economic and Monetary Community (CEMAC) countries. The 2013 assessment found that
risks remain elevated and that annual IMF staff visits to monitor priority recommendations and
progress on the BEAC’s reform plan would continue as part of the safeguards “rolling measures”
approach.1 As such, a safeguards staff visit to the BEAC was conducted during April 1–9, 2014. Staff
concluded that the BEAC had made good progress in implementing recommendations from the 2013
assessment and is advancing its reform plan to strengthen controls. Nonetheless, the BEAC
continues to face challenges on institutional autonomy; and broader governance reforms remain
important in the medium-term.

B. Nonfinancial Relations
Exchange Arrangements:
Cameroon participates in a currency union with five other members of the CEMAC and has no
separate legal tender. Cameroon’s currency, the CFA franc, is pegged to the euro at the fixed rate of
CFAF 655.957 per euro. Local currency equivalent: CFAF 755.95=SDR 1, as of May 31, 2013.
Effective January 1, 2007, the exchange arrangement of the CEMAC countries was reclassified as a
“conventional pegged arrangement” and not anymore as an “exchange arrangement with no
separate legal tender.” The new classification is based on the behavior of the common currency,
whereas the previous classification was based on the lack of a separate legal tender. The new
classification thus reflects only a definitional change, and is not based on a judgment that there has
been a substantive change in the exchange regime or other policies of the currency union or its
members.

FSAP Participation and ROSCs:
A Financial System Stability Assessment (FSSA) report was issued in May 2000. An update of the
FSSA was completed in February 2009, based on the work of a joint IMF-World Bank mission that
visited Cameroon as part of the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) in June 2007, itself
building upon the CEMAC regional FSAP that was conducted in 2006.
The first Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC) on fiscal transparency and
transparency of monetary and financial policies for Cameroon was issued in June 2000.
A fiscal ROSC reassessment mission visited Yaoundé, Cameroon, during May 6–18, 2009. Its report
was issued in June 2010.

World Bank Work Program
Strategy: The new Country Engagement Framework calls for a Systematic Country Diagnostic
(SCD) to be conducted to identify the main development constraints of the country to inform the
Country Partnership Framework (CPF). The CPF will identify the areas in which the Bank will
engage Cameroon for 2015–20 in light of its corporate strategy of ending extreme poverty by 2030
and promoting shared prosperity by fostering income growth of the poor in Cameroon. Although
these analytical endeavors are ongoing, preliminary results indicate that extreme poverty is endemic
in four provinces and growth has not been strong enough to make a dent in poverty reduction. While
the CPF is developed, the Bank will help stimulate more inclusive growth by improving
competitiveness through (i) increased infrastructure investment in the energy, transportation, and
telecommunications sectors; (ii) activities geared toward ensuring the transparent, equitable, and
sustainable use of natural resources; and (iii) promotion of high potential value chains and improved
business climate. For service delivery, the emphasis is on (i) human development (education,
health, and social protection to help develop an effective safety net system based on targeted
programs); and (ii) local development, where the focus will be on increasing access to basic
services through infrastructure upgrading and capacity building for improved local governance.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
A.

Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance

General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance
purposes. There is scope for improvements in quality, coverage, and timeliness in most
macroeconomic datasets. In recent years, the authorities have taken initiative to improve the
macroeconomic database, particularly the national accounts.
Real sector statistics: The Institut National de la Statistique du Cameroun (INS) has released in
December 2013 a revised set of national accounts estimates including key features of the System
of National Accounts 2008 (2008 SNA). Further improvements could be made in some areas,
including the production index, which should be overhauled and integrated with the
corresponding components of the annual national accounts; the selection of price indices for
deflation of national accounts concepts; and information on employment. The STA missions in
2009, 2010, and 2011 supported the compilation of improved national accounts statistics, and led
to the development of quarterly national accounts statistics starting in 2012.
Government finance statistics: The quality of fiscal data is broadly adequate for surveillance, but
has some shortcomings in coverage, periodicity, timeliness, and accessibility. Monthly reports on
the overall budget execution and the investment budget execution have been produced on a
continuous basis. Despite this progress, data on the public finances are still in need of
improvements in quality, coverage, timeliness, and dissemination of data based on the
Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001). Weaknesses in the fiscal data include:
(i) incomplete compilation of budget implementation data on a commitment and, to some extent,
on a cash basis; (ii) a lack of information on the financial information of local governments;
(iii) poor monitoring of cross-liabilities in the public sector and of public enterprise debt; and
(iv) lack of information on the financial information of public enterprises more generally.
The authorities plan to establish comprehensive fiscal accounts on a commitment basis, a
functional classification of the budget and will strive to monitor the float. Moreover, the ongoing
audit of government domestic debt, which will cover cross-liabilities in the public sector and public
enterprise external debt, is expected to strengthen debt data. Efforts to enhance transparency of
financial operations in the oil sector should also improve overall fiscal reporting. Efforts are also
underway to collect data on the operations of the largest 20 public enterprises.
Monetary and financial statistics: Monetary statistics are reported to the Fund by the Banque des
États de l’Afrique Centrale (BEAC) on a monthly basis in the standardized report forms (SRFs), with
delays of up to two months. A key shortcoming of monetary and financial statistics is the lack of
data for interest rates offered by financial institutions to non-financial entities on deposits and
loans. In addition, the depository corporation survey does not include data from deposit taking
microfinance institutions, a growing sector in the country.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CAMEROON

Balance of payments: Since the March 2006 STA technical assistance, the authorities have started
to produce higher quality data within a reasonable time lag but there are still some significant
delays. Balance of payments data are reported annually to STA albeit with some lags. The latest
reported data refer to 2010.
External debt: External debt data are broadly adequate for surveillance, but are comprehensive
only for public and publicly guaranteed debt. Data are collected by the Caisse Autonome
d'Amortissement (CAA), which is responsible for servicing the government's external debt
obligations. The CAA's database is fairly comprehensive, contains accurate stock data, and
produces projected debt-service flows on a loan-by-loan basis. However debt disbursement and
position statements are not regularly received from creditors, which causes significant impairment
to real-time and comprehensive debt monitoring.
B. Data Standards and Quality
Cameroon commenced its participation in the
General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) in 2001.

No ROSC data are available.

C. Reporting to STA
Cameroon does not report data for publication in the IMF Government Finance Statistics
Yearbook or the government finance statistics section in International Financial Statistics. Data
reporting for publication in the Fund’s Balance of Payments Statistics publications has encountered
delays.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

Approved By
Anne-Marie Gulde-Wolf and Bob
Traa (IMF); Jeffrey D. Lewis and
Marcelo Giugale (IDA)

Prepared by the International Monetary Fund—
African Department and the International
Development Association

This debt sustainability analysis builds on the one conducted at the time of the 2013
Article IV Consultation. It finds that Cameroon’s external debt remains sustainable, with
all external debt ratios staying below their respective thresholds. However, the risk of debt
distress has increased from ”low” to “moderate,” as the external debt indicator for the
present value of debt over exports breaches the policy-dependent threshold under a
classic shock to exports. The underlying macroeconomic assumptions in this analysis are
comparable to those used in the previous one. However, the composition and terms of
new external debt have been adjusted to reflect the large, undisbursed debt overhang
contracted on nonconcessional terms to finance the country’s public investment program.
Heavier external borrowing than projected could jeopardize debt sustainability over the
long term and calls for a prudent approach regarding the terms of borrowing. Moreover,
significant vulnerabilities related to a weak domestic debt policy, and a fiscal situation
projected to become increasingly fragile, heighten the risk of overall debt distress.

CAMEROON

BACKGROUND
1.
This debt sustainability analysis (DSA) of Cameroon’s public debt was prepared jointly by
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. It updates the 2013 DSA (IMF Country
Report No. 13/279).1 It uses the latest standard debt dynamic template for low-income countries,2 based
on the most recent external debt data from the authorities, and the macroeconomic framework derived
from the 2014 IMF Article IV consultation. Data are composed of external and domestic debt of the central
government, as well as debt and guaranteed debt of public enterprises. As noted in the previous DSA, debt
statistics could benefit from a more comprehensive coverage of contingent liabilities on financial
institutions and liabilities of public enterprises and municipalities.
2.
The enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) and the Multilateral Debt Relief
Initiatives resulted in a significant decline in Cameroon’s public debt ratios, from more than
50 percent of GDP in 2005 to less than 10 percent of GDP in 2008. However, the public debt-to-GDP
ratio has been steadily increasing since then, reaching 19.5 percent at end-2013. This increase mainly
corresponds to a rise in public external debt, representing 63.4 percent of total public debt at end-2013
(Text Table 1). Bilateral loans from non-Paris club members have significantly grown, representing
30.7 percent of total public debt at end-2013, as opposed to only 4.3 percent at end-2008. This evolution
reflects an increasing number of loans, with less favorable financing conditions, to finance the authorities’
public investment program. Although there was a fall in structured domestic debt in 2012, the overall stock
of domestic debt has remained on a rapid growth path since 2011 (Text Table 2).

UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS
3.
The new macroeconomic framework reflects limited adjustments to projections of key
variables compared to the 2013 DSA framework. Oil revenue is somewhat lower, and growth and
exports are assumed to be somewhat less buoyant in the medium term, but more resilient over the long
term (Text Table 3 and Box 1). Oil revenue, as a percent of GDP, is expected to fall because increases in oil
production are offset by a projected fall in international oil prices and rising production costs. Real GDP
growth remained strong in 2013, thanks to better implementation of the public investment plan, and is
expected to remain robust in the medium term, based on sustained domestic demand and the coming
onstream of infrastructure projects. The volume of non-oil exports is projected to grow by around
9 percent a year, above real GDP growth. The volume of imports is projected to grow by around 7 percent
per year, at a somewhat higher pace than GDP. Inflation is projected to remain well below the 3 percent
convergence criterion of the Central African Economic and Monetary Community (CEMAC).

However, some assumptions have been adjusted. The discount rate increased from 3 percent
for the 2013 DSA to 5 percent, as approved by the IMF and World Bank Executive Boards in October 2013.
The level of external public debt at end-2012 was adjusted upward to CFAF 1,197 billion from
CFAF 1,127 billion, and again to CFAF 1,595 billion at end-2013. Finally, given new information of large asyet-undisbursed debt contracted at nonconcessional rates (over CFAF 2,700 billion at end-2013 versus
about CFAF 2,100 billion at end 2012; Text Table 4), the composition of debt by level of concessionality
from 2013 forward was revised (Text Table 5). The DSA assigns a larger role to non-Paris Club bilateral
creditors, whose loans are nonconcessional, especially in 2015 and 2016, given specific information on
undisbursed loans. Their share of new external financing rises from 49.5 percent of all new debt accrued at
end-2014, reaches a maximum of 51.2 percent by 2015, and falls to 36.9 percent from 2017 onward; the
composition of new debt in the 2013 DSA was characterized by a slower increase in the share of non-Paris
Club members (from 28.8 percent of the total in 2012 to 41.9 percent by end-2018).
5.
Other important assumptions for the DSA remain unchanged, including the assumption of a
limited overall amount of future external debt. The fiscal financing gap is assumed to lead to an
accumulation of mostly domestic debt, which does not come into play when assessing the risk of external
debt distress. Some contingent liabilities in state-owned enterprises (SOEs) have been left out, because
although they may be sizable, their overall amount remains hard to quantify.
Box 1. Cameroon: Macroeconomic Assumptions for the Baseline Scenario1
Medium Term, 2015–19



Real GDP growth is projected to reach an average of 5.5 percent in the medium term, supported by a strong
domestic demand, a rapid increase in oil production, and high public investments. Annual inflation is projected to
remain low, at 2.2 percent, in line with historical trends and below the CEMAC convergence criterion.



The revenue-to-GDP ratio is projected to dip slightly over the medium term, from 17.7 percent of GDP in 2015 to
17.3 percent of GDP in 2019. Although oil prices are expected to ebb over the medium term, production of oil is
assumed to be higher thanks to the recent discovery of an oil field and new technology to tap old wells. However,
this technology is more expensive and will reduce oil revenue in proportion.



The external current account deficit is projected to grow from 4.2 percent of GDP in 2015 to 4.4 percent of GDP
in 2019. The deficit is assumed to be driven by more imports, which in turn stem from real GDP growth and the
need for imported equipment and intermediate goods for infrastructure projects. As before, the current account
deficit is expected to be financed through foreign direct investment, external public borrowing, and other private
capital inflows.

Long Term, 2020–34



Real GDP growth is projected to average 5.5 percent. Long-term growth is driven by non-oil exports, domestic
demand, and a sustained rate of private capital spending consistent with the advent of a more favorable business
climate.



The revenue-to-GDP ratio is projected to decrease from 17.3 percent of GDP in 2020 to 15.3 percent of GDP in 2034.
This trend assumes oil revenue will be decreasing with the depletion of oil reserves, while non-oil revenue is still
sustained by further structural reforms to improve revenue collection and to usher in a more diversified economy.



The external current account deficit is projected to decline gradually to 3.5 percent of GDP in 2034, on account of a
strong non-oil export growth facilitated by the coming onstream of new infrastructure, such as the Kribi deep-sea
port, while oil exports become less important.

EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ASSESSMENT
6.
The Low Income Countries (LICs) debt sustainability framework is guided by countryspecific indicative debt burden thresholds for external debt. These thresholds reflect the empirical
findings that sustainable debt levels for a LIC increase with the quality of policies and institutions, which is
measured by the World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) index (Text Table 6). This
DSA is informed by Cameroon’s CPIA score for 2012. The score of 3.23, on a scale of 1 to 6, has virtually not
changed over the last five years and corresponds to an assessment of weak institutional capacity.
Cameroon’s rank is better than the CEMAC average (2.9) and in line with the sub-Saharan African (SSA)
average. The indicative external debt burden thresholds for countries in this category are (i) a present value
(PV) of the debt-to-exports ratio of 100 percent; (ii) a PV of the debt-to-revenue ratio of 200 percent; (iii) a
PV of the debt-to-GDP ratio of 30 percent; and (iv) debt service-to-exports and revenue ratios of
15 percent and 18 percent, respectively.

7.
Cameroon’s external debt remains sustainable, with all external debt ratios staying below
their respective thresholds (Text Table 7 and Figure 1). There is, however, an upward trend for all debt
ratio indicators, before subsequently abating at the end of the projection period. This is due to the
assumption that the large fiscal financing gaps in the macroeconomic framework are to be financed by
domestic debt, while external debt accumulation remains on a more modest path by comparison.
Moreover, the grant element of new external borrowing is on average lower than in the previous DSA,
while other relevant variables do not change much. These developments lead to a bigger challenge to
finance public investments sustainably.

However, Cameroon’s risk of external debt distress, based on strenuous standard stress
testing, has increased from “low” to “moderate.” A shock to exports causes the ratio of the PV of
external debt to exports to exceed 100 percent by 2016 (Figure 1, panel c). This new development reflects
the higher external debt stock at end-2013, the magnitude of the standard stress test,3 and, to a lesser
extent, the change toward less concessionality in the composition of new external debt.

PUBLIC SECTOR DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ASSESSMENT
9.
As in the previous DSA, the inclusion of domestic debt exacerbates the pace of
accumulation of public debt, and shows a clear deterioration in the debt ratios. The stock of domestic
debt is projected to increase faster than external debt over the medium term, as the projected fiscal
financing gaps are rolled up into domestic debt, in the form of new government securities, more
securitization of arrears, and the accumulation of further domestic arrears. Therefore, the PV of debt-toGDP ratio is expected to reach higher levels than in the previous DSA, from 19.5 percent of GDP in 2014 to
almost 50.9 percent of GDP in 2034, after breaching the indicative ceiling of 38 percent of GDP in 2021. The
PV of debt-to-revenue and the PV of debt service-to-revenue show a similar upward trajectory.
10.
The overall amount and the uncertain financing terms of the financing gaps, and the
uncertain level of contingent liabilities add another element of risk. While Cameroon faces a moderate
risk of debt distress based on an assessment of public external debt, it faces a higher overall risk of debt
distress reflecting significant vulnerabilities related to its weak domestic debt policy, such as a roll-over risk.

CONCLUSION
11.
This DSA confirms the growing risk of an unsustainable accumulation of total public debt.
Its mitigation requires a mix of a more conservative fiscal policy and more favorable debt terms. Although
Cameroon’s current debt burden remains low, both domestic and external borrowings have expanded at a
rapid pace and at increasingly nonconcessional terms. Risks are growing because future financing needs
remain unidentified and reasonable pricing and maturities may not be secured.
12.
On the basis of this DSA, Cameroon’s external debt remains sustainable, but its risk of
external debt distress has increased from “low” to “moderate.” All debt indicators trend below their
policy-dependent thresholds, but a shock to exports causes the ratio of PV of external debt to exports to
exceed 100 percent by 2016. This underscores Cameroon’s particular vulnerability to an oil price shock, or a
more limited increase in oil production than currently foreseen. This result calls for the adoption of prudent
debt policies favoring more concessional terms, and the importance of economic growth to help diversify
the export base and generate additional revenue. Nonconcessional loans should only be considered for
well-assessed, high-yield commercial or infrastructure projects that will generate sufficient government
3

The relevant “most extreme” stress test is a growth rate of exports at its 10-year historical average minus one
standard deviation applied over 2015 and 2016, resulting in a negative growth of exports of 7.1 percent each year
(versus a negative growth of 5.7 percent for two successive years in the 2013 DSA). A shock resulting in negative
growth of exports of less than 5.8 percent for 2015 and 2016 would not cause a breach of the policy-dependent
threshold, nor would any of the other standard stress tests.

revenue to cover debt service related to the projects. Export growth will originate primarily from the private
sector, which requires a more favorable business climate.
13.
The rapid increase in external debt between the previous and this DSA points to significant
risks related to insufficient data coverage, lags in communication with some creditors, and, to date,
inoperative upstream controls on new debt contracting. Current project implementation
arrangements allow for direct payments between foreign contractor and external lender, which need to be
reported without delay to the Government. The creation of the National Public Debt Committee (NPDC)
has been a step in the right direction, but questions remain as to its effective role in the process of
evaluating and contracting new debt. Given the rapid rise in external debt and the large undisbursed debt
overhang, staffs recommend subjecting new disbursements of external debt to a prior approval by the
NPDC.
14.
The Cameroonian authorities have indicated their agreement with the analysis and
conclusions reached in this DSA. They agreed that it is essential to maintain debt sustainability, and share
the view that current debt trends, if left unaddressed, pose a risk to the country’s long-term fiscal stability.
Staffs recommended to subject new loans to a review by the NPDC to ascertain their consistency with debt
sustainability. The authorities noted that given the large financing needs in the near term, they may have to
contract nonconcessional loans in the absence of available alternative concessional financing for projects
with a high return. The authorities are working with the World Bank regarding the ceiling of
nonconcessional loans.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2014 Article IV Consultation
with Cameroon
On June 30, 2014, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Cameroon1 and considered and endorsed the staff appraisal without a
meeting.2
Background
The pace of economic growth accelerated in 2013, reaching 5.5 percent (compared to 4.6 percent
in 2012). Average annual inflation remained subdued at 2.1 percent, because food prices remained
stable and fuel prices, controlled. Growth was particularly buoyant in the services and construction
sectors, the latter supported by strong public investment. The higher demand for capital goods led
to an increase in imports, which offset the improving export performance of the oil sector.
Cameroon’s robust economic performance since 2007 does not appear to have dented poverty
significantly. Recent estimates show a slight decrease from 39.9 percent of the population in 2007
to 38.7 percent in 2011, while growth incidence curves indicate that inequality may have
increased.
The fiscal situation deteriorated in 2013. Oil revenue, which represented more than a quarter of all
revenue, was lower than expected, because oil production and prices remained stable, but
production costs increased. Retail fuel subsidies reached 2.8 percent of GDP and externally
financed capital expenditure surged to 3.4 percent of GDP. These developments led to a budget
deficit (on a cash basis) of over 4 percent of GDP, versus 2 percent of GDP in 2012.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
very year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the
country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the
basis for discussion by the Executive Board.
2

Article IV consultations are concluded without a Board meeting when the following conditions apply: (i) there are
no acute or significant risks, or general policy issues requiring Board discussion; (ii) policies or circumstances are
unlikely to have significant regional or global impact; (iii) in the event a parallel program review is being completed,
it is also being completed on a lapse-of-time basis; and (iv) the use of Fund resources is not under discussion or
anticipated.

2
Cameroon’s debt burden remains low, thanks in part to extensive debt relief in 2006, but it is
growing at a fast pace. As a result of new nonconcessional external debt, the debt
sustainability analysis shows that Cameroon’s risk of external debt distress has increased
from “low” to “moderate”. On current trends, overall public debt is slated to double as a
percentage of GDP between 2012 and 2019.
There has been progress in the banking system, as two previously troubled banks were able
to restructure their balance sheets. The regional supervisory authority is in the process of
strengthening its human resources to increase the frequency of its supervisions. A major
concern remains the excessive concentration in bank credit toward the financially fragile
national oil refinery.
Economic growth is expected to remain at about 5.5 percent annually over the medium term
under current policies, while inflation is projected to remain below the regional convergence
criterion of 3 percent. Oil exports will be sustained by volume growth, although prices are
projected to decrease gradually. Large public investment projects in infrastructure will
continue to support non-oil growth over the next few years. The private sector’s response to
the new infrastructure is expected to take over as the main driver of growth thereafter,
assuming a significant improvement in the business environment.
Substantial risks undermine Cameroon’s development prospects. Regional insecurity has
deteriorated markedly over the past year. Fuel subsidies and a weak revenue effort continue
to undermine a more pro-poor and pro-growth budget; and limited progress in improving the
business environment stymies the advent of the formal private sector.
Executive Board Assessment
In concluding the 2014 Article IV consultation with Cameroon, Executive Directors endorsed
staff’s appraisal, as follows:
Cameroon’s increased public investment spending has accelerated growth. The authorities
need to implement higher quality policies and improve governance to promote development.
The current level of growth, in itself, is not sufficient to accelerate poverty reduction and
achieve upper-middle-income country status by 2035. A combination of reforms to enhance
the cost-effectiveness of public expenditure and to foster private sector response has become
critical. Regional security risks add an element of urgency to reforms to make the economy
more resilient and to rekindle regional integration.
The fiscal stance requires adjustment. Risks to the 2014 budget need to be addressed without
delay to avoid further accumulation of domestic arrears that undermine fiscal sustainability.
Non-oil revenue performance will remain tepid unless unwarranted exemptions are removed,
the tax base is broadened, and tax administration is made more effective. International oil
prices and domestic demand will keep fuel subsidies high, unless pump prices are
progressively raised. Contingent liabilities in the public and banking sectors and Public
Private Partnerships (PPP) threaten fiscal sustainability.

3
The envisaged ratification of the Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) could further
undermine revenue in the long term. An evaluation of its direct and indirect impacts on
revenue is necessary, and could inform new discussions on regional integration with the
Central African Economic and Monetary Community (CEMAC) partner countries.
Although debt remains sustainable, new external liabilities have pushed the risk of external
debt distress from “low” to “moderate.” The level of external debt remains low relative to the
average of Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) but the pace of debt accumulation is faster, and the risk
of external debt distress would be higher still if the composition of future financing were to
preserve or exceed external levels observed in 2013 and expected for 2014, rather than
gradually decreasing as currently projected. The sensitivity of external debt sustainability to
exports calls for export diversification.
The projected external debt accumulation points to a need to generate more value from public
investment. A three-pronged approach is necessary: (i) a new round of project selection to
identify projects with a high impact on growth and poverty reduction, and the rolling back of
non-essential projects; (ii) the integrity of public financial management needs to be
strengthened, including competitive procurement to generate more cost-effective spending;
and (iii) the terms of new debt need to be more concessional.
A broad array of reforms to the business environment needs to be initiated, because its
credibility will take time to establish. The private sector needs to take over as the main
engine of growth by the time the public investment program is scaled back. The various
reform areas cited by the Doing Business indicators point to a direct link between
improvements in revenue policy, public financial management and private sector activity;
they include “trading across borders” and “paying taxes”.
Risks to the banking system have receded, but financial intermediation remains low. The
restructuring of two troubled banks leaves only three small banks in need of a resolution. The
microfinance sector could expand faster and with less risk with the adoption of a regulatory
framework and diligent joint supervision by the Commission Bancaire de l'Afrique Centrale
(COBAC) and the Ministry of Finance. The new bank for Small and Medium Enterprises
(SME) is in need of regulatory vigilance, starting with its credit policy.
