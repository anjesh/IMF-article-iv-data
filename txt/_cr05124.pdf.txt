Discussions were held in Port Vila during November 8–19, 2004. The staff team
comprised Ms. Creane (head), Mr. Marciniak, and Ms. Fujita (all APD). Mr. Reddell
(OED) joined the discussions.

•

The team met with President Mataskelekele, the Minister of Finance and Economic
Management, the Governor of the Reserve Bank, other senior officials, and
representatives of financial institutions, public enterprises, tourism and other private
sector enterprises, labor unions, and the donor community.

•

In concluding the 2002 Article IV consultation on November 22, 2002 (IMF Country
Report No. 02/265), Executive Directors commended the authorities for
macroeconomic stability and progress on structural reform. However, they noted that
growth was lackluster as persistent fiscal weaknesses had led to inadequate basic
infrastructure and a high-cost production structure. For more rapid growth and lasting
fiscal consolidation, Directors emphasized that more needed to be done to strengthen
revenue and redirect spending toward infrastructure and social services, along with
additional measures to improve the environment for private investment. Directors
also called for stronger regulation and supervision of offshore banks.

•

Vanuatu has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, and
maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on payments and transfers
for current international transactions. Data quality and coverage improvements have
been made since the last consultation and Vanuatu now participates in the GDDS.
The authorities plan to again publish the Staff Report and related documents.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Economic Setting
•

An improved external environment provided a boost to economic growth in 2003–
04, after two years of decline. Exports and tourism showed sharp improvement in both
years in volume terms. The recovery was supported by strong macroeconomic policies.
The authorities strengthened the fiscal accounts by improving revenue collection and
introducing expenditure controls, and as a result maintained total public debt at a
manageable level. A cautious monetary and exchange rate policy has succeeded in
keeping inflation low.

•

However, growth prospects are not bright without a reinvigorated policy
commitment to reform. Relative to comparator countries in the Pacific and Caribbean,
per capita GDP growth performance over the last decade has been poor due to structural
weaknesses, and rapid population growth. Underlying structural problems include poor
infrastructure, a weak public enterprise sector, high business costs and the need for
strengthening the environment for foreign investment.

Key Policy Issues
•

With appropriate policies in place, Vanuatu has growth potential over the medium
term, especially in agriculture and tourism. The current improved economy provides
an appropriate environment for proceeding with these needed measures. However,
political instability during 2004, until the change in government in December, has
distracted the government from focusing on economic policy priorities for the economy.

•

Fiscal expenditure reorientation is required to raise economic growth over the
medium term, given still pressing development needs. The resources for infrastructure
outlays could be generated under the current fiscal envelope, through a reduction in
current spending, particularly the wage bill, and further improvement in tax compliance.
Development needs could be then met within the ongoing plans for fiscal consolidation,
allowing room for social spending and for public debt to be reduced gradually over the
medium term.

•

Further efforts are needed on structural reforms to reduce the high-cost structure
and improve the environment for private activity. Good progress has been made in
strengthening banking supervision, but additional measures are required. An overhaul of
the weak public enterprise sector is needed. Further action is required to regulate
monopoly utilities, pass a competition law, and streamline steps required for investment
approval.

Political instability has hindered implementation of needed reforms during
much of 2004 (Box 1). The coalition government which took office in July 2004 was
followed by a new period of uncertainty, including a deterioration in relations with the donor
community, delays in pending economic and financial legislation, and proposed policies
which would reverse previous economic reforms. Following a motion of no confidence in

BOX 1. POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT IN VANUATU
Background. The current political environment has its roots in the Anglo-French
condominium where France and Britain shared control over Vanuatu (then New Hebrides). The
two parties dominating politics at independence in 1980, one identified with Anglophone
voters and one identified with Francophone voters, have since splintered into more than ten
political parties plus independents. With 52 parliamentary seats, elected by universal adult
suffrage, no party regularly earns a majority of the vote. The resulting coalition governments
survive only for short periods as political unions are created and dissolved with frequency.
Since the early 1990s, there has been a high degree of political instability in Vanuatu.
•

Although not subject to the unrest seen in some of the neighboring Pacific island countries,
the political instability distracts from needed action on reforms.

•

At the same time, increasing political fractionalization further complicates progress on
reforms, due to the need to accommodate a growing number of political constituencies.

•

The private sector regularly lists political instability among its major concerns inhibiting
investment.

2004 was a year of particularly intense political uncertainty.
•

Following increasing parliamentary discord in the early part of the year, in May then Prime
Minister Natapei called an election to avoid a possible no-confidence vote. None of the
major parties won a majority in the early July elections (the largest number of seats held by
any party was 10), and after a long period of negotiations, a fragile coalition government
was formed at end-July under Prime Minister Vohor. Almost immediately negotiations
resumed among the parties along with talk of a new no-confidence vote. In September a
no-confidence motion was put before Parliament but defeated by the Vohor government.

•

At the same time, relations between the Vohor government and donors were deteriorating,
particularly following the expulsion of Australian law enforcement advisors in August
together with public statements questioning the role of all foreign advisors. The
government also disregarded court decisions and planned an expansion in the number of
ministries to accommodate the diverse factions in the coalition. Donors expressed concern
over developments, and Australia, a major donor, warned of reductions in its aid program.

•

Prime Minister Vohor’s controversial attempts to grant diplomatic recognition to Taiwan
Province of China led to his coalition’s defeat by a no-confidence motion in December
2004. Prime Minister Ham Lini formed a new government, which maintains Mr. Moana
Carcasses as Minister for Finance and Economic Management. Relations with donors have
since improved, as seen in the subsequent visit to Port Vila by Australian Prime Minister
Downing.

-7-

December 2004, a new government under Prime Minister Ham Lini was formed (Finance
Minister Carcasses and Governor Tevi have remained in their positions). The initial public
statements of the Lini government point to an improved budget outlook, a resumption of
financial sector reforms, and strengthened dialogue with donors. At the same time, the
comprehensive economic policy of the new government has not yet been announced and its
commitment to pursuing needed deep reform is still uncertain.
3.
Some progress has been made in beginning to address issues identified at the last
Article IV consultation, despite the unstable political environment. Executive Directors
emphasized the need to ensure lasting fiscal consolidation, strengthen the regulation and
supervision of offshore banks, and implement structural reforms. Since then, fiscal balances
have improved with strengthened tax revenue, including the introduction of the
recommended excise tax on alcohol and tobacco, and new expenditure controls. However,
spending is still not well prioritized and capital expenditure is sharply lower, despite
development needs. The financial supervision of offshore banks has been significantly
improved. Additional reform, such as restructuring public enterprises and improving
infrastructure, remains crucial for establishing the sound private sector environment needed
to raise economic growth over the medium term. During the November discussions, the
authorities noted that they found missions’ views during Article IV consultations useful, and
welcomed the initiation of interim-year staff visits.
II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
4.
The Vanuatu economy recovered in 2003–04 following two years of decline
(Table 1 and Figures 2–4). Real GDP growth rebounded to 2.4 percent in 2003 and the
recovery continued in 2004 with growth of an estimated 3 percent, notwithstanding the crop
damage caused by Cyclone Ivy early in the year.2 The improvement was bolstered by a
strong supply response to a recovery in export prices and the liberalization of trading in two
key exports (cocoa and copra), the discovery of new markets for kava following the ban by
several EU countries in 2002, and higher tourist arrivals with an expansion in airline capacity
to Vanuatu (Figure 5).3 4
5.
Fiscal consolidation continued over the past two years (Table 2). Although in large
part reflecting sharply reduced development expenditure, new controls on current spending
and improved tax collection also contributed to the outcome. However, the wage bill
remained high, while service delivery to the outer islands continued to be poor. Following the
completion of large development projects, capital outlays fell to an average 1.6 percent of
GDP in 2003–04 from an average 4.5 percent of GDP in 1999–2002, despite continued

The outlook is for a softening of the macroeconomic environment in 2005. Real
GDP growth is expected to taper off closer to trend as global commodity prices for many of
Vanuatu’s exports again ease, notwithstanding the expected full year impact on tourism of
the increased airline capacity. Inflation is likely to edge higher with the delayed impact of
higher world oil prices. The current account deficit should widen slightly, as a boost in
imports related to tourism investment offset an increase in tourism revenue. Official foreign
reserve levels should remain roughly unchanged in U.S. dollars. Based on early reports of the
revised 2005 budget expected to be submitted for Parliamentary consideration in February,
the fiscal accounts should be near balance, as higher current spending, including an increase
in parliamentarians’ salaries and higher spending on education, are accompanied by
additional donor funding.
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Overview
9.
The discussions focused on the policy priorities needed to raise Vanuatu’s
economic growth rate sustainably above that of its population growth rate.7 The
consultation took place in November during the last month of the previous government’s
tenure. Some of the concerns raised during the discussions have now been eased, including
the previous government’s plans to expand the size of government and to possibly reverse
gains made in financial sector supervision. However, the main themes of the consultation
discussion—namely the need to broaden the economic base to strengthen resiliency to
external and natural shocks—remain valid. The mission’s recommendations included the
following key components:
(i)

7

Continuing the responsible fiscal and monetary policies followed in recent years;

Real GDP growth averaged about 1.5 percent on an annual basis over the past decade, against average
population growth of about 2.5 percent.

- 10 -

(ii)
Reorienting government spending toward more productive capital outlays through
both revenue and expenditure measures, while maintaining needed social spending;
(iii) Further strengthening of the financial sector to improve availability and lower costs of
domestic credit, and
(iv)

Structural reforms to improve the environment for private sector activity.
B. Outlook and Risks

10.
Growth prospects over the medium term are not bright without a stronger
policy commitment for deeper reform (Table 5, Figure 6, and Box 2). On the current
trajectory, without an active reform effort that addresses weak infrastructure and other
sources of high business costs, real GDP growth could fall below even the current moderate
level of 2.5–3.0 percent. Pressures to raise current spending would likely continue to be
difficult to resist, leading to a return to fiscal deficits. In contrast, with a stronger reform
effort (Table 7) than that currently contemplated, growth could rise to allow an improvement
in per capita GDP over the medium term. Vanuatu has growth potential, especially in
agriculture and tourism. By reorienting fiscal spending to well-targeted social and
infrastructure needs, introducing further financial sector reform, and creating an investmentfriendly environment, growth prospects could improve considerably, along with an improved
external balance, further accumulation of foreign reserves, and a gradual reduction in public
debt. Areas for increased infrastructure spending include roads, electricity, water, and
transportation both in the main and outer islands.
11.
Given its narrow base, the economy will remain vulnerable over the medium
term. Its resilience will depend on the strength of implementation of structural reforms,
while the downside risks pointing to a less favorable outlook are sizeable (Table 8). The
recent history underscores the importance of political stability and the preservation of good
relations with major donors, particularly given the need to fund additional development
spending through grants. Other risks include the possible absence of political commitment to
reform and continued exposure to natural disasters.8
C. Fiscal Policy
12.
The discussion of fiscal policy focused on the growth implications of continuing
to compress needed spending on social services and infrastructure. In light of continued
high development needs and limited financing options for the government, the mission

8

Based on the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters’ database and definition of a natural
disaster (events due to natural causes that caused 10 or more fatalities, affected 100 or more people, or resulted
in a call for international assistance or the declaration of a state of emergency) over the past decade Vanuatu
was subject to one natural disaster (earthquake, cyclone, flood or volcano eruption) each year. These data do not
include other natural disasters, e.g., a windstorm, that may not meet these criteria but may still cause substantial
damage.

BOX 2. ECONOMIC GROWTH IN VANUATU
Vanuatu’s growth over the past decade was weak even relative to comparator island economies.
Yet, Vanuatu fulfills many of the theoretical requisites for strong economic growth: a relatively
sound macroeconomic environment with low public debt, limited inflation, and an open trade
regime. Available evidence suggests structural factors leading to low total factor productivity
underlie the poor growth performance.

Vanuatu experienced changes in the composition of growth after independence. The importance of
services—in particular, tourism—increased significantly, while agriculture showed more moderate
growth. Since the early 1990s, developments in the services sector have driven overall real GDP
growth. The potential for further growth in these sectors is promising. However, currently tourism
remains largely centered in the urban areas on the two larger islands as weak power, transportation
and communication limit outward expansion. Similarly, transportation constraints hinder farmers
from bringing crops to market. These structural limitations were notably weaker than those of the
faster growing comparator island economies.

Addressing these structural weaknesses should yield considerable gains for medium-term growth.
Steps to take include increasing quality investment in human capital and infrastructure by
redirecting government expenditure toward development spending and improving the environment
for private investment.

- 12 argued instead for an increase in capital spending financed by a combination of revenue and
expenditure measures. Such a strategy would allow small budget surpluses to be maintained
over the medium term, a continuation of critical social spending, and a gradual debt reduction
in line with the authorities’ own overall objectives (Box 3).
13.
The authorities were in broad agreement with these concerns, and outlined
recent measures and plans on the revenue side that would consolidate progress already
made in broadening the tax base and strengthening tax administration. VAT and
customs administration have improved with the new automated entry system, which
strengthened tax audit and compliance procedures. A new computerized system to be
introduced during 2005 will link the two data bases for further improved monitoring. The
mission welcomed this step and encouraged introducing additional measures to further
strengthen tax audit procedures. In light of the poor dividend collection from public
enterprises, the mission recommended reviewing their governance and cost structures. The
mission additionally advocated addressing tax concessions which amount to about
1.5 percent of GDP annually. The authorities concurred with the need for tightening tax and
duty exemption criteria, and noted plans to remove the full exemption status of statutory
authorities and discretionary exemptions for other non-strategic industries. Neither the
mission nor the authorities favored introducing new tax measures at this point; Vanuatu’s tax
burden is in line with those of other similar-income countries and raising taxes could
negatively impact economic growth.

A reorientation of the pattern of expenditure is needed to reduce less productive
spending and redirect outlays toward social and infrastructure expenditure. Spending
prioritization remains weak as capital outlays have been cut back sharply, following the
completion of donor-funded projects, while the wage bill remains large by global standards
(56 percent of recurrent expenditure or over 11 percent of GDP in 2004). The authorities

BOX 3. FISCAL STRATEGY: DISCIPLINE AND ECONOMIC GROWTH
Under the government’s 2004-06 economic and financial policy, the long-term objective is to
introduce the fiscal discipline needed to run surpluses over the medium-term to allow for debt
repayment and contingencies such as natural disasters. At the same time, development
expenditure is to be increased over time to about 25 percent of total expenditure with the goal
of achieving a higher level of sustainable economic growth. However, currently development
expenditure is declining and about 7 percent of total expenditure in the 2004 budget outcome,
the lowest in the region; thus, there is considerable distance yet before realizing this strategy.

but pointed to financing constraints, noting that they preferred to rely on donor funds for
capital spending. In addition, the authorities were eager to introduce a well-considered public
investment program before proceeding with further large capital spending plans, so as to
avoid using scarce revenue or incurring debt for non-productive projects. A donor-funded
macroeconomist is expected to prepare an investment plan by mid-2005. The authorities also
argued that the relatively large current spending on wages and education reflected Vanuatu’s
archipelago geography and the need to provide resources for each remote island. At the same
time, the authorities noted expenditure measures that have been taken and are planned in the
interests of prioritizing spending. To control the wage bill, in 2004 the government recently
extended the Financial Visa System to the education sector and has plans to cut the civil
service by 20 percent over the medium term.9 The mission additionally advocated reversing
the proposed 20 percent increase in salaries for parliamentarians, which could eventually
stimulate pressure for a general public sector wage increase. While noting this concern, the
authorities were of the view that political realities made a reversal unlikely. In light of
weaknesses in the education sector (despite relatively high budget allocations, the adult
literacy rate remains comparatively low), the mission also recommended reviewing its cost
structure relative to social benefit and identifying ways to achieve higher productivity. In
addition, further increases in education spending should be deferred pending the outcome of
this review. The authorities observed that an audit of the Education Ministry will take place
in 2005, with assistance from the EU.
15.
Vanuatu follows a prudent public debt policy. Vanuatu currently aims to limit the
total stock of debt to no more than 40 percent of GDP and requires new external borrowing
to deliver a financial rate of return to cover the costs of debt servicing. The rate of return
constraint does not bind domestic borrowing, although the authorities are mindful of the
dangers of crowding out private activity. The mission cautioned that parallel concerns
strongly advise against giving consideration to raising the limit on Reserve Bank of Vanuatu

(RBV) deficit-financing, including the potential consequences for macroeconomic stability.10
Indeed, the mission noted that continuing with the recent trend toward fiscal consolidation
would minimize financing concerns, and allow further reductions in debt and a build-up of a
contingency in case of unforeseen natural disasters.
D. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
16.
Through use of the basket peg as a nominal anchor, monetary policy has
successfully kept inflation low. The authorities are strongly committed to continue to pursue
the restrained monetary stance needed to maintain the peg. The mission noted that monetary
policy alone cannot support the peg and that close coordination with the fiscal authorities, to
limit government borrowing from the RBV, is also needed.
17.
The exchange rate and the adjustable peg exchange rate regime remain broadly
appropriate at this time (Figure 7). The real effective exchange rate has been broadly stable
since the late-1990s, measured on both partner and competitor bases. Export and tourism
receipts grew rapidly in 2003–04, in both value and volume terms. Vanuatu’s export market
share also remained roughly stable over the past ten years, even as the Pacific region’s share
declined. Pressures on official reserves have eased with the rebuilding of official reserves to
6 months of imports, one of the highest levels in the region. The mission and the authorities
were in agreement that maintenance of the current regime would require the continuation of
macroeconomic policies consistent with the peg, and that, in parallel, firm action should be
taken to reduce underlying fiscal and structural rigidities which raised non-price costs. At the
same time, some flexibility in the exchange rate regime has been introduced as the RBV
widened its buy and sell margins slightly and started offering to buy foreign exchange within
the full range of its published rates; these steps should help to develop the foreign exchange
market.
18.
The RBV has made progress in building capacity for discharging its
responsibilities. In particular, the mission supported the RBV’s ongoing plans to put in place
strengthened internal audit procedures and improved reserve management, including a risk
management system. In addition, the mission encouraged the RBV to upgrade the payments
system to allow for automated operations. Finally, the mission welcomed the introduction of
greater transparency in monetary policy through the Governor’s semi-annual monetary policy
statements.
E. Structural Reform Policies
19.
Good progress was made in strengthening Vanuatu’s financial sector, although
further measures remain to be taken. Vanuatu made impressive gains in financial sector
supervision with the passage of the International Banking Act in 2002 and the broadening of
the RBV’s supervisory responsibilities to the offshore banking sector and the Vanuatu

previous three years’ government budget current revenue.

National Provident Fund (VNPF).11 In addition, the necessary measures were taken to allow
the OECD to remove Vanuatu from the list of uncooperative tax havens in 2003. The mission
urged further enhancement of Vanuatu’s reputation in the global financial community
through early passage of the AML/CFT amendments to the Financial Transactions Reporting
Act (FTRA). The mission also advocated strengthening of the Financial Intelligence Unit
(FIU) as it was not yet fully operational nor able to carry out its mandated role. The
authorities agreed to recruit the additional needed staff. The mission recommended parallel
strengthening of the Vanuatu Financial Service Commission’s (VFSC) resources, which is
currently tasked with oversight of nonbank offshore institutions (including insurance and
fiduciary services) by passing the necessary legislation (including the Insurance Act which is
behind schedule) and increasing still limited staff resources. Technical assistance from LEG
to strengthen the insurance supervisory framework is planned. An overall cost-benefit
assessment of the impact of the offshore sector on the Vanuatu economy, as recommended
by MFD, is now underway and should be completed this spring.
20.
The financial sector in Vanuatu is considered to be sound, although there are
areas of potential risk (Box 4). The increase in nonperforming loans (the NPL ratio rose to
18.5 percent in September 2004 from 8.4 percent at end-2003) reflected the downgrading of a
small number of loans contracted under previous weak loan management at one private
commercial bank (a branch of a major foreign bank). Management of the bank has since been
changed by its parent bank and loan approval policies strengthened. The loans are fully
provisioned and the RBV expects these will be worked out through the market without need
for government intervention. The RBV will continue to monitor the situation closely. The
state-owned bank, the National Bank of Vanuatu, is now showing a small profit following
restructuring in 2000 and the contracting out of its management to experienced bankers.
21.
The mission advised against proposals to expand the role of government
financial institutions. In response to concerns about rural access to credit, the authorities are
weighing plans for reintroducing a publicly funded development bank and for increasing the
lending operations of the VNPF. In light of past experience in Vanuatu and in other countries
with both development banks and pension-fund lending activities, the mission strongly urged
the authorities to rely instead on market-related mechanisms, such as the collateral loan
project proceeding with assistance from the AsDB and the existing microfinance window in
the commercial banking sector.
22.
Given the importance of a dynamic private sector in attaining higher economic
growth and generating employment, the mission and the authorities agreed that a
renewed effort was needed to improve the environment for private activity. The entry of
competitive air service was a tangible illustration of the benefits of liberalization in that it
had resulted in increased numbers of tourist arrivals and reduced air fares. In light of the
continued high costs for communications and electricity relative to regional comparators

A long-term MFD advisor provided technical assistance on banking supervision during 2002–04. The
financial sector, including the offshore banking sector, is described in the accompanying background paper.

BOX 4. FINANCIAL SECTOR DEVELOPMENTS, STRENGTHS AND VULNERABILITIES
The banking system is relatively large, and although it is considered sound it is exposed to a
number of potential risks. Deposits with the banking system are more than double GDP, given the
offshore banking sector. Although banks are liquid, the level of non-performing loans is now high. At
the same time, capital adequacy is solid. Tier 1 capital accounts for nearly 98 percent of total capital,
and its growth is largely driven by retained earnings.

1/ As of September 2004.

A bright spot has been the strides made in strengthening financial sector oversight, especially
for offshore banks, in line with recommendations from MFD’s 2002 OFC Assessment report.
The number of offshore banks was sharply reduced in 2003, as a result of bringing them under the
RBV’s direct supervision and stricter regulations including the requirement of a physical presence.
The authorities are moving forward on the AML/CFT initiative; a financial intelligence unit for
monitoring offshore bank activities has been established with Fund technical assistance, although it
not yet fully staffed; following delays during 2004, the amended Financial Transactions Reporting Act
(FTRA) should be considered by Parliament early in 2005. Similar action will be needed to bring the
nonbank offshore sector under an adequate level of supervision

- 18 -

(see Box 2), the mission was encouraged by the authorities’ planned review of the public
utilities’ tariff structure, benefits, and inputs, and creation of a small regulatory unit with
oversight over the utility monopolies. To improve the incentives for private investors, the
mission also strongly encouraged introducing a competition law as well as speeding up
establishment of an electronic “one-stop shop” for investment approval.
23.
Progress in reforming public enterprises remains slow. Public enterprise finances
are poor, overall, in part reflecting the absence of market-based management. The mission
encouraged reevaluating the financial status of all public entities and considering the options
of introducing competition or dismantling them. For example, the remaining licensing
responsibilities of the liberalized Vanuatu Commodities Marketing Board (VCMB) could be
incorporated within the Ministry of Finance. At a minimum, the mission recommended
conditioning existing transfers and tax exemptions for public enterprises on receipt of full
financial statements. The authorities agreed with the need to improve the efficiency and
transparency of the public enterprises, and plan to begin an intensive review of the sector
beginning with the television and radio company.
24.
Vanuatu has an open trade regime and is expanding its regional trade links.
Vanuatu’s participation in the Pacific Island Countries Trade Agreement (PICTA) and the
Pacific Agreement on Closer Economic Relations (PACER) was ratified by Parliament in
2004. Vanuatu also participates in the Economic Partnership Agreement negotiations with
the EU. The mission welcomed the authorities’ plan for 2005 to sharply reduce the number of
tariff rates to four (including a zero rate) while maintaining revenue neutrality, along with the
recent liberalization of trade in copra and cocoa through the reorganization of the VCMB
which benefited export receipts. To provide for a more open trade regime, the mission
recommended removing existing ministerial discretion in banning imports. In addition, the
VCMB’s 2 percent fee on copra and cocoa exports appears to effectively amount to an export
tax and its removal is recommended. Finally, Vanuatu should safeguard its tourism assets by
protecting the environment, including careful management of non-renewable fishing and
forestry resources.
25.
Vanuatu’s macroeconomic data improved since the last consultation, although
further upgrading would allow more comprehensive economic analysis and
surveillance. Vanuatu began participating in the Fund’s General Data Dissemination System
(GDDS) in 2003. Core economic data are updated in a regular and timely manner, which has
enhanced surveillance. Despite some donor technical assistance, however, two of the key
statistical areas—national accounts and the balance of payments—remain weak. Data are not
available for public enterprise operations and the labor market.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
26.
Vanuatu achieved positive real growth over the last two years, following two
years of decline, but the outlook for future growth is not bright without a reinvigorated
policy commitment to deeper reform. Despite political instability, growth rebounded in
2003–04 supported by a favorable external environment and macroeconomic policies. Fiscal
consolidation continued, albeit in large part reflecting sharply reduced development
expenditure, and total public debt remained at a manageable level. Careful monetary and

- 19 -

exchange rate policies have succeeded in keeping inflation low. Vanuatu has growth
potential over the medium term, especially in agriculture and tourism. However, continued
fiscal and structural weaknesses limit the prospects. The current improved economy is an
appropriate environment for proceeding with needed reforms.
27.
A reduction in current spending, particularly the wage bill, and increased tax
compliance could finance higher outlays for targeted social and infrastructure
expenditure. The staff welcomes the authorities’ plans to introduce a cross-compliance
monitoring system between the VAT and custom duties data bases. On the expenditure side,
steps should be taken including reducing the wage bill, removing discretionary tax and duty
exemptions, and improving efficiency in education spending. With appropriate policies in
place, development needs could be met within the ongoing plans for fiscal consolidation,
allowing total public debt to be reduced gradually over the medium term.
28.
Monetary and exchange rate policies have been managed successfully in recent
years. The current restrictions on RBV financing of the government sector should be firmly
maintained. The staff finds the current level of the exchange rate and the existing adjustable
peg exchange rate arrangement to be broadly appropriate for the Vanuatu economy.
29.
Good progress was made in strengthening banking supervision, but additional
measures are needed. A welcome reform was the recent extension of the RBV’s supervisory
responsibility to cover the offshore sector and the VNPF. However, the lack of adequate
staffing and resources in the FIU should be addressed without delay. The authorities are
encouraged to pass the Insurance Act promptly, adopt the proposed amendments to the
FTRA, and introduce further measures needed for strengthening the AML/CFT legislative
framework.
30.
The staff advises against plans for increased lending operations by government
financial institutions. The proposals to raise the limits on VNPF lending and to revive a
publicly funded development bank, both of which previously resulted in financial crises in
Vanuatu, are of concern. Instead, access to credit in rural areas could be improved by
expanding existing market-based microcredit operations in collaboration with commercial
banks and donors.
31.
Further efforts are needed on structural reforms to improve the environment for
private activity. Steps should be taken to reduce Vanuatu’s high cost structure through
introducing regulation over monopoly utilities, passage of a competition law, streamlining
steps required for investment approval and upgrading infrastructure. Staff welcomes the
authorities’ intentions to address these issues. In addition, given the poor performance overall
of the public enterprise sector, the authorities are urged to move quickly with the planned
review.
32.
While progress was made in statistical reporting, there remains a need to ensure
accurate and timely data are available for policymakers. The staff welcomes the
participation in the Fund’s GDDS and the improvement in the quality and availability of
government budget and monetary aggregate data. While data provision for surveillance is
adequate overall, staff’s analysis was affected by shortcomings in certain areas, given

- 20 -

continued weaknesses in data quality and availability for the national accounts, the balance of
payments, public enterprises and the labor market.
33.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be conducted on the 24month cycle. The authorities have expressed interest in a staff visit in 2005.

Figure 6. Vanuatu: Medium-Term Macroeconomic Outlook, 2003–10
Under the baseline scenario, without active reform addressing high business costs, improved infrastructure and weak public
enterprises, GDP growth would continue at moderate rates below population growth, pressures on wages would lead to
larger fiscal deficits and unchanged public debt levels .

A stronger reform effort on both macroeconomic and structural policies would create room for greater development spending
and reduce costs to the private sector, attracting private investment and donor grants, and result in higher economic growth,
positive fiscal balances and a reduction in government debt. The external current account would strengthen with stronger
export performance, and, along with higher capital inflows, would boost reserves.

A high risk scenario , including a reveral of reforms and poor relations with donors, would lead to gradual slowing of GDP
growth over time, as development needs are not met and structural problems not addressed. Fiscal and external balances
would deteriorate as spending pressures grow while exports of goods and services remain weak. Government debt levels
would rise and official reserves subside.

SDR Department:

Since 1988, Vanuatu has maintained an adjustable peg exchange rate arrangement. Currently,
the exchange rate of the vatu is linked to a transactions-weighted (trade and tourism receipts)
basket of currencies. The weights and composition of the basket, which are not publicly
disclosed, are adjusted periodically (most recently in June 2004). The Reserve Bank of
Vanuatu (RBV) quotes daily buying and selling rates for the vatu against the U.S.,
Australian, and New Zealand dollars; the euro; the U.K. pound; and the Japanese yen. The
rate in terms of the U.S. dollar as of December 31, 2004 was VT 106.5 per U.S. dollar.
Vanuatu has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, and maintains an
exchange system that is free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current
international transactions.
VIII. Article IV Consultation:
The last Article IV consultation discussions with the authorities were held in Port Vila during
August 2002. The Executive Board discussed the staff report and concluded the consultation
on November 22, 2002.

VANUATU—RELATIONS WITH THE
PACIFIC FINANCIAL TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CENTER (PFTAC)1
Since 1998, the Center’s assistance to Vanuatu has included 31 advisory missions, with a primary
focus in banking supervision and statistics. In addition, Vanuatu has sent 28 officials to the Center’s
regional seminars, workshops, and training courses.
Banking Regulation and Supervision
PFTAC works closely with the resident advisor on banking supervision. The Center also organized
peripatetic advisors on insurance legislation and insurance supervision, the establishment of a bank
reporting database system and a Financial Intelligence Unit. As a result, a number of the May 2002
recommendations of the offshore financial assessments program report have been introduced. The
Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of Vanuatu is the current Chair of the Association of Financial
Supervisors of Pacific Countries for which PFTAC acts as the Secretariat.
Public Financial Management
AusAid has funded an extensive technical assistance program in budget management. PFTAC has
complemented that assistance through advice on prioritization and sequencing of needed reforms,
and, in 2003, by training of staff on moving budget reporting to a GFS basis (see below).
Tax Administration and Policy
PFTAC assistance has been limited to short diagnostic missions on strengthening customs
administration and introducing select excises.
Economic Statistics
Following a PFTAC review, technical assistance provided by STA in the context of the GDDS/
PFTAC project for Pacific Island countries resulted in Vanuatu producing quarterly balance of
payments and international investment position statistics consistent with the BPM5. The Centre
trained staff and developed plans for presenting government finance statistics on the basis of the 2001
GFS Manual and for integration of GFS classifications with the budget and accounting systems. Data
based on the new standards is nearing completion. PFTAC also undertook a mid-term review of the
statistics element of an AusAID/ADB funded institutional strengthening project.

1

The Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre (PFTAC) in Suva, Fiji is a multi-donor technical assistance
institution, financed by the IMF, AsDB, AusAID, NZODA, and, until 2001, by the UNDP, with the IMF as
Executing Agency. The Centre’s aim is to build skills and institutional capacity for effective economic and
financial management that can be sustained at the national level. Member countries are: Cook Islands,
Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa,
Solomon Islands, Tokelau, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu.

ANNEX III

VANUATU—RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP1
(As of January 2005)
Since joining the World Bank Group in 1981, Vanuatu has received five IDA credits totaling
$18.9 million (all fully disbursed) in the areas of agricultural extension and training (1983),
transportation and education infrastructure (1986), primary and secondary education (1988),
affordable housing (1991), and a Learning and Innovation Loan (2001).
The Bank has also supported utilities reform through a series of policy-based workshops, and
has recently provided funding through the Public Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility for
a performance and regulatory review of the water, power, and telecommunications sectors. In
addition, the Bank has provided analytical and advisory services to Pacific Island countries,
including Vanuatu, through its biennial Regional Economic Reports. The report for 2002
analyzes trade liberalization and complementary reforms in the Pacific Island economies.
The forthcoming 2005 report will assess Human Development issues and progress in the
Pacific region and includes a focus on Vanuatu as one of a number of case study countries.
In other areas, the Pacific Enterprise Development Facility has been providing support to
individuals and intermediaries to allow them to on-deliver quality services in country. Two
initiatives are underway in Vanuatu; one is working with the Melanesian Savings and Loans,
and another with a tourism association.
In addition, the Foreign Investment Advisory Service has been assisting the Vanuatu
Investment Promotion Authority with the drafting of a National Investment Policy Statement,
and follow-on involvement is expected.

ANNEX IV

VANUATU—RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK1
(As of end-December 2004)
The Asian Development Bank’s (AsDB) operations in Vanuatu started in 1981. As of end-December
2004, the AsDB had provided nine loans (a total of US$51.25 million) and 53 technical assistance
projects (US$14.96 million).
The loan projects include assistance for agriculture, cyclone damage rehabilitation, port facilities,
urban infrastructure development, development financing, and the Comprehensive Reform Program
(CRP). The technical assistance projects cover both project preparation and advice in the areas of
agricultural and forestry development, agricultural support services, energy, industrial estate
development, transport and communications, social infrastructure, population planning, economic and
fiscal management, vocational training, CRP support, and access to affordable credit.
No loans were extended in 2004 and none are programmed for 2005 due to the government’s
reluctance to borrow. In the last quarter of 2004, technical assistance was approved for the preparation
of a medium-term strategic framework, and reform of the legal and regulatory framework for
collateralized loans. The latter is targeted at creating access to affordable credit for small and medium
sized entrepreneurs.
In 2005, advisory technical assistance is programmed for corportization of the Ports Authority, and for
rural productive skills development.
The strategic thrust of the AsDB’s operations for Vanuatu over the medium term continues to be to
build local capacity for sound economic management and good governance and maintain its support
for the CRP while (i) stimulating private sector development and GDP growth by dealing with the
underlying constraints and policy issues; and (ii) supporting the provision of improved rural
infrastructure and social services. There is a strong parallel concern for addressing poverty,
employment, environment, and other social issues, particularly in the rural areas.
The indicative lending program is expected to amount to a maximum of US$6.0 million over the next
three years. The technical assistance program is estimated to amount to around US$1.5 million.

ANNEX V

VANUATU—STATISTICAL ISSUES
Improvements have been made in Vanuatu’s economic statistics, but deficiencies persist in
methods and coverage. The Reserve Bank of Vanuatu (RBV) is responsible for balance of
payments (BOP) and monetary statistics; the Ministry of Finance (MoF) for government finance
and external debt statistics, and the National Statistics Office (NSO) for most other official
statistics (including GDP, consumer prices, external trade, tourism activity, and labor and
demographics). Available economic and financial data are published regularly in the RBV’s
monthly Financial and Economic News and Quarterly Economic Review and in the NSO’s
quarterly Statistics Indicators (SI). Recent technical assistance on the BOP and national
accounts was provided by the Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre (PFTAC) in
national accounts and, by STA in the context of the Fund’s GDDS/PFTAC project for Pacific
Island countries, in BOP (see Annex II). Vanuatu began participating in the Fund’s General
Data Dissemination System (GDDS) in April 2004.
National Accounts and Prices
The NSO has compiled annual estimates of GDP by type of economic activity (in current and
constant prices) through 2003. The estimates, prepared with technical assistance from the
PFTAC, Asian Development Bank, and AusAID, have been published in the quarterly SI and
posted on the NSO’s website. In support of this work, data from an annual business survey and
an informal sector activity survey (last conducted in 2000) are being incorporated into national
accounts estimates. A national census was conducted in 1999 and a labor market survey in 2000.
The CPI is compiled on a quarterly basis. The NSO has no plans to improve the frequency,
timeliness, or coverage (which is largely urban-based) of the CPI owing to resource constraints.
Government Finance Statistics
Government finance statistics (GFS) are compiled on a monthly basis, but are not officially
published. Quarterly GFS data have been included in the RBV’s Quarterly Economic Review
and the NSO’s quarterly Statistics Indicators (SI) and posted on the website in a timely manner
since 2001. The quality and timeliness of data have improved since a GFS mission visited
Vanuatu in November 1998. Follow-up assistance on expenditure data has been provided by
PFTAC and AusAID as part of ongoing work in strengthening public financial management. As
a result, government expenditure data on a functional basis were prepared starting in 1998, and
have been released for publication since 2003. However, although GFS annual data are reported
for publication in the GFS Yearbook, the data are highly aggregated and not clearly defined.
GFS data are not reported for publication in the IFS. Some inconsistencies exist between the
fiscal and monetary accounts in terms of reconciling data on domestic financing of the budget
by the banking system reported by the RBV and the MoF.

- 42 -

Monetary Statistics
Monetary statistics are compiled on a monthly basis for the RBV and three domestic deposit
money banks (DMBs). In reporting these data to the Fund for IFS, the RBV submits a
breakdown of sundry income that allows STA to properly reclassify these accounts. However, a
similar breakdown is not provided for the DMBs. The RBV has developed a standard reporting
system for the offshore sector and the data on the activity of offshore banks are published
quarterly.
External Sector Statistics
The BOP is compiled on a quarterly basis. As a result of PFTAC technical assistance, in the
context of the GDDS/PFTAC project for Pacific Island countries; extensive revisions have been
made to annual BOP data, especially to net investment income and current transfers and to the
capital and financial accounts and various sub-items. This has reduced the size and variability of
net errors and omissions as reported by the RBV. Coverage of private flows has also improved
with the adoption of a revised enterprise survey by end-2002. Assistance is ongoing to refine
methods for compiling the BOP to ensure its consistency with government budget and
commercial bank data and to more fully incorporate activity of the offshore financial sector. The
authorities also are working with PFTAC to complete the Coordinated Portfolio Investment
Survey. Data on external debt and debt service (all official) are compiled annually by the MoF

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
March 11, 2005

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2004 Article IV Consultation with
Vanuatu
On February 25, 2005, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Vanuatu.1
Background
Vanuatu achieved positive real growth in 2003–04, after two years of decline.
Macroeconomic stability was maintained and some progress made in addressing structural
weaknesses. However, a weak environment for private activity, including poor
infrastructure and political instability, and rapid population growth have compounded the
difficulties that come from a narrow output and export base, and contributed to low per
capita GDP growth relative to comparator Pacific and Caribbean island countries over the
past decade. As a result, the outlook for the faster economic growth needed to lift living
standards is not bright without a deepening of reform. Human development indicators are
low. About 40 percent of the population is below the poverty line and 80 percent of the
labor force is employed in subsistence activities in rural areas.
Real GDP growth rebounded to 2.4 percent in 2003 and the recovery continued in 2004
with growth of an estimated 3 percent. The improvement was bolstered by a strong supply
response to a recovery in export prices and the liberalization of trading in two key exports
(cocoa and copra), the discovery of new markets for kava following the ban by several
countries in 2002, and higher tourist arrivals with an expansion in airline capacity to
Vanuatu.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by
the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman
of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to
the country's authorities.

-2-

Fiscal consolidation continued over the past two years. Although in large part reflecting
sharply reduced development expenditure, new controls on current spending and
improved tax collection also contributed to the outcome. However, the wage bill
remained high, while service delivery to the outer islands continued to be slow due to
capacity constraints. Following the completion of large development projects, capital
outlays fell to an average 1.6 percent of GDP in 2003–04 from an average 4.5 percent
of GDP in 1999–2002, despite continued pressing development needs. Reflecting the
government’s cautious approach to incurring new public debt, total public debt, including
external debt, fell below 40 percent of GDP.
Against the background of a basket-peg exchange rate regime, inflation has remained
subdued at just under 3 percent in 2004. Broad money growth picked up in 2004, as
deposits with the banking sector rose and the net foreign assets position of commercial
banks strengthened. Commercial banks’ liquidity positions improved in 2004, allowing
for lower lending rates, which resulted in a slight narrowing of the interest rate spread.
The external current account deficit narrowed in 2004 with the stronger performance in
tourism and exports. In real effective terms, the vatu remained broadly stable over the
past five years, while official reserves have recovered since 2002.
Progress has been made in strengthening Vanuatu’s financial sector. Important gains in
financial sector supervision took place with the passage of the International Banking Act
in 2002 and the broadening of the Reserve Bank of Vanuatu’s supervisory
responsibilities to the offshore banking sector and the Vanuatu National Provident Fund.
The state-owned National Bank of Vanuatu is now showing a small profit following
restructuring in 2000. In addition, the OECD removed Vanuatu from the list of
uncooperative tax havens in 2003.
The outlook is for a softening of the macroeconomic environment in 2005 and growth
prospects over the medium term are not bright without a stronger policy commitment for
deeper reform. Real GDP growth is expected to taper off as global commodity prices for
many of Vanuatu’s exports again ease, notwithstanding the expected full year impact on
tourism of the increased airline capacity. Inflation is likely to edge higher with the
delayed impact of higher world oil prices. On the current trajectory, without an active
reform effort that addresses weak infrastructure and other sources of high business
costs, real GDP growth could fall below even the current moderate levels. Given its
narrow base, the economy will remain vulnerable over the medium term. Vanuatu has
growth potential, especially in agriculture and tourism. Its resilience will depend on the
strength of implementation of structural reforms, while the downside risks pointing to a
less favorable outlook are sizeable. The recent history underscores the importance of
political stability, particularly given the need to fund additional development spending
through grants. Other risks include the possible absence of political commitment to
reform and continued exposure to natural disasters.

Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the improvement in Vanuatu’s macroeconomic
performance over the last two years, reflected in positive growth, low inflation, a
sustainable debt, and a comfortable international reserves position. Progress has been
made in structural reform, especially in the banking sector.
Going forward, Directors stressed that the authorities need to focus their attention on
raising per capita income growth and reducing the economy’s vulnerability to shocks.
Attainment of these goals will require sustained fiscal consolidation and broad-based
structural reform to boost private investment and diversify the economy. Directors urged
the new government to seize the opportunity provided by the current favorable
economic climate to build broad support for a reinvigoration of structural reforms, in
order to deliver consistently strong economic policies despite the uncertain political
environment. This will, in addition, increase donor confidence in Vanuatu.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ efforts to strengthen the fiscal position over the past
two years, and in particular the enhanced controls on current spending and improved
tax collection. However, they expressed concern that fiscal adjustment has come in part
through a reduction in capital outlays that could jeopardize future economic
development. Directors encouraged the authorities to maintain revenue growth through
both continued strengthening of tax compliance and a reduction of tax and duty
exemptions. On expenditure, the most important tasks are to reduce the wage bill,
improve efficiency in education spending, and reallocate spending toward infrastructure
and basic social services. Directors welcomed the continuation of the prudent public
debt policy.
Directors endorsed the Reserve Bank’s cautious monetary policy stance, aimed at
keeping inflation low and building up international reserves. They advised close
cooperation with the fiscal authorities with the aim of limiting government borrowing from
the Reserve Bank. Directors considered the adjustable peg exchange rate arrangement
to be broadly appropriate, while emphasizing that it demands sound macroeconomic
policies and broad-based reforms to improve competitiveness.
Directors commended the strengthening of the oversight of the financial sector in the
past two years, including the extension of the Reserve Bank’s supervisory
responsibilities to the offshore banking sector and the Vanuatu National Provident Fund.
They noted that, while the banking system is sound, the level of nonperforming loans is
high and should be monitored closely. Directors welcomed the important steps taken to
combat money laundering and terrorism financing. They urged the authorities to enact
promptly all additional legislation necessary to bring the financial sector into compliance
with international AML/CFT standards, to provide adequate staff to the Financial
Intelligence Unit, and to reinforce oversight of nonbank financial institutions. In light of
Vanuatu’s past experience, Directors cautioned against reviving a publicly funded
development bank.

Directors called for a stronger effort to promote private sector development, particularly
by removing impediments to business activity. Key actions would include streamlining
investment procedures and upgrading the infrastructure. In addition, Directors urged the
authorities to expand their restructuring efforts to all public enterprises—and to privatize
these enterprises where appropriate—in order to improve enterprise efficiency and
transparency and to increase competition.
Directors welcomed the improvement in the quality, coverage, and timeliness of key
statistics needed for surveillance purposes, and Vanuatu’s participation in the Fund’s
General Data Dissemination System. They encouraged further efforts to upgrade the
national accounts and balance of payments statistics.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by Michael Reddell, Alternate Executive Director for Vanuatu
February 25, 2005

Key Points
•

Vanuatu faces many and diverse challenges; some exogenous and others of its own
making.

•

The country has a strong track record of prudent and cautious macroeconomic
management. The level of self-discipline in assuming new debt is particularly
impressive.

•

Economic reform is needed, although this will take time. In the meantime, the key
tourism sector is experiencing strong growth and high levels of new investment.

•

Government spending (as a share of GDP) is modest, and although there is scope for
reducing the size of the public service, overall expenditure on public sector wages
and salaries needs to be considered in light of the small and widely-scattered
population.

•

The authorities appreciate Fund technical assistance and APD’s offer of more
frequent policy dialogue.

Vanuatu faces many and diverse challenges. Some of these have to do with size and
geography – a little more than 200,000 people, speaking many different languages, are
scattered over more than 80 islands in the South Pacific, all at a considerable distance from
major population centers and potential markets. The weather also poses challenges. Vanuatu
experiences cyclones almost every year and is at constant risk of volcanic eruptions and
earthquakes. Indeed, the Commonwealth Secretariat has ranked Vanuatu as the most
vulnerable to natural disasters of the 111 developing countries it studied. These are
constraints that will always affect Vanuatu’s development and growth opportunities and they
help to shape its cautious and prudent approach to macroeconomic management.
Other challenges are home-grown. The population is rising rapidly (and unlike many Pacific
Island countries, Vanuatu has no natural migration outlet), creating pressures on, inter alia,
public spending. A degree of political uncertainty has also become something of a fact of
life in Vanuatu, and an irritant for potential investors. Indeed, with seven changes of
government since 1998, Vanuatu is rivaling the post-war experiences of one or two European
countries. All those changes have been conducted peacefully and in accordance with the
provisions of the constitution: the legal system is strong, robust, independent, and widely
respected. And as the staff report notes, in the most recent change of government the
incumbent Minister of Finance retained his position.
In recent years, Vanuatu has built up a strong track record of prudent and cautious
macroeconomic management. The fiscal position has gradually been brought back to

-2balance, inflation has been kept low and stable, foreign reserves have risen to levels that are
relatively high by regional standards, and the adjustable peg exchange rate regime has served
Vanuatu well. Perhaps most impressively, at a time when this Board is once again discussing
debt relief for a large number of other less developed countries, it is worth highlighting that
Vanuatu has adopted, and lived within, a self-imposed limit on its public debt – setting out to
get, and keep, its total stock of debt at below 40 percent of GDP (and much of that on
concessional terms), and requiring any new external borrowing to deliver a financial rate of
return to cover the cost of debt servicing. Faced with constant pressures to increase
spending, and against a backdrop of poor Human Development Indicators, the ability of
successive governments to live within this constraint is a considerable credit to Vanuatu and
an example to others.
Notwithstanding the prudent macroeconomic management of recent years, the Vanuatu
economy has struggled over the last decade as a whole; per capita GDP has fallen, and
Vanuatu has underperformed most of the other Pacific Island economies. My authorities are
well aware of the need to address the factors that contributed to this decline, although the
pace of reform is constrained by political realities. In recent years, however, economic
performance has been more encouraging, with growth last year estimated to have been
around 3 percent.
As staff note, a number of factors have been at work, but tourism has grown particularly
strongly – airborne visitor arrivals, for example, were up 18 percent last year. New airline
capacity, helped by government’s new open skies policy, has contributed significantly to the
growth. The government is committed to ensuring the viability of Air Vanuatu’s business
model, to support continued strong growth in the key tourist sector. And extensive private
sector investment in new accommodation and resort properties is taking place already and/or
expected to begin in the coming year (at least 40,000 new annual room nights are due to
come on stream this year, an increase in the stock of more than 10 percent). Meanwhile, high
and rapidly rising coastal property prices in and around Port Vila, speak to an ongoing
interest by foreigners to participate in Vanuatu. The government has implemented a “onestop shop” for foreign investors, although the extent of foreign investment, and the
continuing need to promote economic development among the indigenous ni-Vanuatu,
remains a potent underlying source of political friction. This is likely to be a particular issue
in realizing Vanuatu’s considerable agricultural potential.
As staff note, central government expenditure in Vanuatu is not high (as a share of GDP) by
the standards of the region, and continuing improvements in the revenue collections systems
and reviews of the current duty exemptions, might allow some increase on total spending
without increasing statutory tax rates or imposing new taxes (Vanuatu has neither corporate
nor personal income taxes). Vanuatu’s spending is, however, heavily concentrated on wages
and salaries for public servants (12 percent of GDP). My authorities fully recognize the need
for streamlining the civil service and the Minister of Finance indicated to the mission his
hope to be able to cut civil service numbers, in time, by 25 percent. Steps in this direction
would enable the authorities to allocate more domestic resources towards much-needed
capital projects, and to become less reliant on donor assistance. Nonetheless, Vanuatu’s
rugged archipelagic geography is likely to mean that the share of GDP devoted to public

-3service salaries is higher than in some other more physically compact countries, given the
pressure to provide basic health and education services throughout the country (and it is, for
example, considerably lower than the share in several other countries in this constituency,
which have small populations thinly scattered over vast areas of ocean).
Public enterprises are a sector where there is likely to be scope to secure significant
efficiency gains. At present, only two of the trading enterprises report a profit. Tackling, and
streamlining, formal governance structures will be politically difficult, and the authorities
expect to focus their efforts on reviewing the basic business models of the various enterprises
to help secure efficiency gains. Officials from the Ministry of Finance will be directly
involved in this process.
Vanuatu has continued to build on the progress reported at the time of the last Staff Report in
strengthening bank supervision and ensuring that its legislative and regulatory environment is
consistent with international standards. The onshore banking system is sound,
well-regulated, and its credit risks are appropriately provided for. Other initiatives will
continue. The FIU and Financial Services Commission are being strengthened, and
amendments to the Financial Transactions Reporting Act are expected to be passed by
Parliament later this year. My authorities believe that the offshore financial centre, which
has done much to shape the character of Vanuatu’s business services sector over past
decades, is now appropriately regulated and are keen to have this recognized by the
international community (business and regulatory). However, as staff note, an overall
assessment of the impact of the offshore sector on Vanuatu’s economy is underway, using
external advisers, and the report will be carefully considered by the government when it is
finalized.
My authorities are very grateful for the Fund’s technical assistance, both directly and through
PFTAC. That assistance has been particularly important in recent years in strengthening the
supervisory regime for Vanuatu’s banking system. The authorities also note that valuable
PFTAC assistance has enabled them to make material improvements in Vanuatu’s balance of
payments statistics. New balance of payments data and international investment position
statistics have been produced and the coverage of the Coordinated Portfolio Investment
Survey has been improved. The authorities are determined to continue the program of
improvement in the quality of balance of payments statistics.
In closing, we thank the staff for their report and for the dialogue that took place with the
mission during their stay in Port Vila. My authorities value the opportunity to consult with
the Fund on the macroeconomic picture, and appreciate APD’s initiative to offer to undertake
a staff visit in the off year of the biennial Article IV cycle to help maintain the dialogue.
