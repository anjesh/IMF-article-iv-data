EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background
Qatar has weathered the global financial crisis exceptionally well, reflecting the swift and
strong policy response by the authorities. The sizeable enhancement of liquefied natural gas
(LNG) capacity, large government support to the banking system, and increase in public
spending helped sustain high growth rates through the global crisis. Growth has rebounded to
16 percent in 2010 and is projected to accelerate to 20 percent in 2011. Headline consumer
price inflation is negative in 2010, reflecting a sharp fall in domestic rents, although non-rent
prices have started to rise. The banking system remains sound. While bank credit for
consumption and real estate stagnated after 2009, credit to public sector companies increased
sharply. The economic outlook remains positive, with the main downside risk being a sharp
decline in hydrocarbon prices.
Policy discussions focused on (i) the policy mix required for maintaining macroeconomic
stability while sustaining high growth rates in the nonhydrocarbon sectors; (ii) the stance of
fiscal policy in the medium term; (iii) strengthening the efficiency of the domestic financial
system and regulatory arrangements; and (iv) assessing productivity performance to help
design a diversification strategy.
Staff’s recommendations


While the current expansive fiscal stance remains appropriate and monetary
policy should remain geared towards supporting credit growth, aggregate
demand needs to be carefully monitored in order to avoid the emergence of
inflationary pressures. Qatar Central Bank (QCB) will have to rely increasingly on
macroprudential instruments to manage the credit cycle and to counter potential surges
in capital inflows.



Preserving the policy of saving a share of hydrocarbon wealth is key to
maintaining macroeconomic stability and intergenerational equity. Improving
productivity will be important to support self-sustaining long-term growth in the
nonhydrocarbon sectors.



The exchange rate is broadly aligned with fundamentals. The dollar peg has served
as an effective nominal anchor. Nevertheless, it will be important to enhance the
technical, institutional, and operational capacity, including development of a local debt
market, in case an alternative exchange rate regime becomes desirable in the context of
the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) monetary union.



Establishing a debt management office and setting up a macro-fiscal unit will
constitute important institutional reforms to support policy making.



Further improvements in statistics will be essential, and will require greater
coordination between various agencies.

4
Authorities’ views


The authorities pointed out that the countercyclical fiscal stance and the
government’s support to the banking system ensured financial stability and
helped sustain high growth rates through the global crisis. They are mindful of the
need to manage the risk of potential overheating arising from demand pressures. Over
the medium term, the government budget would continue to allocate increased
resources for infrastructure investment, while keeping current expenditure in check.
Major infrastructure upgrades related to the FIFA World Cup 2022, such as the
integrated metro/rail systems, roads, and airport, have already been taken into account
in the medium-term expenditure profile, since they were planned notwithstanding the
outcome of their bid to host the World Cup.1 Additional expenditure to the government
budget is not expected to be significant.



QCB has a range of instruments to manage liquidity. It has further room to reduce
interest rates, and can resort to prudential regulation by limiting credit ratios and
sectoral exposures to manage both credit growth and potential surges in capital inflows.
Inflation is not viewed as an issue of concern in the short term, mainly because of the
current excess supply in real estate.



The authorities will continue to save part of the hydrocarbon revenues through
their sovereign wealth fund, to facilitate intergenerational equity. They expect
nonhydrocarbon revenues to increase as a result of the recently introduced measures to
rationalize and broaden the corporate tax base. The establishment of the value-added
tax in the context of the GCC monetary union would broaden the tax base further.
Current expenditure would be contained over the medium term by enhancing spending
efficiencies, resisting increases in salaries, and shrinking the size of government to the
extent possible. Their objective is to fully finance their budgets after 2020 from
nonhydrocarbon revenues.



The authorities are committed to the exchange rate peg to the U.S. dollar. They
are, however, strengthening the institutional and operational capacity in financial
markets, which would prove useful in case an alternative exchange rate system
becomes desirable in the context of the GCC monetary union.



QCB is closely monitoring potential risks to the banking system. The central bank
published its first Financial Stability Review and intends making this an ongoing
process. The authorities’ commitment to establish a single financial regulatory
authority under the umbrella of the central bank remains undiminished. They continue
to align their supervisory and regulatory frameworks with best standards and practices,
and plan to implement Basel III proposals early.

On December 2, 2010, Qatar was chosen to host the FIFA World Cup in 2022.



The authorities are making efforts to improve data quality and coverage, as they
advance toward the GCC monetary union. They have sought technical assistance on
improving Consumer Price Index (CPI) statistics.
I. BACKGROUND

Qatar is one of the fastest growing economies in the world. Its LNG capacity will reach a
peak of 77 million tons per year (mtpy) in 2011 compared to 30 mtpy in 2008, and less than
5 mpty in 1997.2 Hydrocarbon GDP grew at an average rate of about 11 percent between 1990
and 2009, while non-hydrocarbon GDP grew at an average rate of 9.5 percent.
II. CURRENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
A doubling of natural gas production, timely intervention in the banking system, and
continuing large public investment in infrastructure have kept growth rates high and resulted
in the accumulation of large surpluses in the fiscal and external accounts. Headline inflation is
negative, reflecting sharp declines in rents.
1.
Real GDP growth in 2010 is projected to rebound to 16 percent, up from
8.6 percent in 2009. Real hydrocarbon growth of 22.7 percent in 2010 is driven mainly by a
38 percent increase in LNG production in 2010. The nonhydrocarbon sector is expected to
grow by 10 percent. Investments in hydrocarbon-related manufacturing industry
(petrochemicals and fertilizers), large-scale infrastructure projects (airport, port, water
systems, roads, housing and tourism), social infrastructure (health and education), and
financial services (banks and the Qatar Financial Center) are the main drivers (Figure 1).
2.
Headline inflation is negative in 2010, but non-rental prices have started to rise.
Although average consumer prices are projected to decline by 2.6 percent in 2010, reflecting
the slump in real estate, core inflation (excluding food and rents) will average 2.5 percent.3 In
September 2010, non-rent inflation increased by 4.1 percent year-on-year, of which food
prices increased by 2.4 percent.

2

Qatar’s 20-year investment program, which focused on a strategy to commercialize its substantial natural gas
resources, culminates in 2012. The State has placed a moratorium on development of new hydrocarbon projects
until 2015 to give itself time to assess its production performance and carry out a comprehensive study of its
North Field. Lifting the moratorium would depend on the results of a study into the North Field’s long-term
potential and expectations about the path of global demand.
3

There are measurement issues in the CPI. The sharp decline in rental inflation is overestimated to some extent as
the monthly survey of rental prices is mainly confined to new contracts or those currently available for
occupancy. As a result, the magnitude of decline in the overall CPI may actually be smaller than what is evident
from the data.

The overall fiscal surplus is projected to remain high in 2010/11. Staff projects a
surplus of 9.7 percent of GDP in 2010/11, compared to 14.2 percent of GDP in 2009/10.
Revenues are projected to increase by 7 percent in 2010/11. The budget incorporates
a 14.6 percent growth in development expenditure (albeit flat at 10 percent of GDP), while
current spending is expected to be contained at 17.5 percent of GDP in 2010/11, down from
19.6 percent of GDP in the previous year (Figure 2).4
4.
External sector developments are favorable. As hydrocarbon prices recovered in
2010 and volume of exports increased, the current account is estimated to record a surplus of
$22 billion (17.3 percent of GDP) in 2010, compared to $10 billion (10 percent of GDP) in
2009. The overall balance of payments accumulated a large surplus, enhancing the net
foreign assets (NFA) of the central bank by $6 billion at end-September 2010, and increasing
reserve adequacy to nearly eight months of prospective imports of goods and services.
5.
Broad money growth is estimated at 21.3 percent in 2010. Total domestic credit
extended by the banking system would rise by 12 percent, mainly reflecting a 40 percent
increase in credit to the public sector. Bank claims to the private sector, however, is projected
to increase by 8.5 percent, as credit for consumption and real estate remained constant
in 2010.5 As private sector deposit growth accelerated to an estimated 26.5 percent in 2010—
mainly due to a rise in corporate domestic deposits—commercial banks’ liquidity position
continued to be comfortable and their claims on the central bank increased (Figure 3).

4

Development expenditure includes allocations of about $17 billion toward infrastructure (New Doha airport,
New Doha port, roads, sewage, land reclamation, and expansion of electricity and water network), education,
and healthcare.

In June 2009, QCB prohibited banks from financing customers’ trading in securities.

The banking system is well capitalized and profitable. Banks had a high capital
adequacy ratio of 17.4 percent, low nonperforming loans ratio of 1.9 percent, and a
comfortable provisioning coverage of 85 percent at end August 2010.6 Profitability
was 20 percent higher in the first three quarters of 2010, compared to the same period
of 2009. The post-crisis recovery in the stock market remains relatively sluggish. The Qatar
Exchange index has recovered 66 percent of its pre-crisis levels, compared to 97 percent by
S&P 500 and 71 percent by MSCI GCC index. Overall global and regional events, including
those in Europe have not resulted in a re-pricing of Qatar’s sovereign risk (Figure 4).7
7.
Qatar has taken advantage of an improved external financing environment to
raise external funds. The government issued several tranches of bonds in 2009 to create a
sovereign benchmark yield curve aimed at facilitating issuances by government-owned
corporates and commercial banks. As a result, the external borrowings of the sovereign and
corporates doubled to $70 billion between 2008 and 2010. Qatar’s sovereign and guaranteed
external debt is mostly long term and the debt servicing profile does not indicate potential
refinancing difficulties in the foreseeable future. The table below, which presents five
categories of sovereign vulnerability indicators, does not show any significant weakness that
would expose Qatar to heightened downside risks from overburdened government finances.

III. OUTLOOK AND RISKS
The economic outlook is favorable; the main downside risk to the outlook comes from lower
oil and gas prices.
8.
The economic outlook for 2011 remains strong. A further expansion in LNG
capacity, and activity in the nonhydrocarbon sectors will boost real GDP growth to
20 percent and further increase fiscal and external surpluses. Continued growth in the
manufacturing sector, a pickup in the construction sector, and sustained activity in financial
and government services, transportation and communication will drive the nonhydrocarbon
sector growth of 9.5 percent. Nonetheless, headline inflation will remain subdued at
3.0 percent, as rents are expected to remain low. The fiscal and external balances are
projected to post surpluses of $13 billion and $39 billion, respectively.
9.
Continued government investment will keep nonhydrocarbon growth high
beyond 2011, although overall growth would decline due to constant LNG production.
While the self-imposed moratorium on increasing gas production after 2012 will lead to a
sharp tapering off of growth in the hydrocarbon sector, government investments will support
an average growth of 9 percent in the nonhydrocarbon sectors during 2012–15. Headline
consumer price inflation is projected at 4 percent over the medium term, as rents stabilize due
to a gradual narrowing of the current excess capacity in real estate. Non-rent inflation,
however, could resurge as the recovery in international commodity prices affecting Qatar’s
import basket and growth in domestic demand continue. The fiscal and external balances are
projected to remain in surplus through 2015.8
10.
A fall in natural gas prices poses the main risk to the outlook. The tail risk of a
collapse in hydrocarbon prices would also have adverse implications for hydrocarbon
revenues, and could result in an uncertain outlook for investment, and consequently Qatar’s
nonhydrocarbon growth prospects. An assumption of oil prices of around $40 per barrel and
no policy change points to a budget deficit from 2012 onwards.9 The current account surplus
would turn from a surplus of $39 billion to a deficit slightly lower than $4 billion in 2011
itself (Appendix I). Additionally, shocks in the global financial environment might affect
Qatar’s access to, and pricing of, international funding.

8

The success of Qatar’s bid to host the FIFA World Cup in 2022 would not fundamentally alter staff’s mediumterm outlook.
9

Oil price is assumed at $40 per barrel in 2011, and thereafter increases at the same rate at which oil prices
increase in the benchmark scenario.

13
IV. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Maintaining Macroeconomic Stability
While the current expansive fiscal policy stance remains appropriate and monetary policy
should remain geared towards supporting credit growth, aggregate demand should be
carefully monitored in order to avoid the emergence of inflationary pressures. The central
bank will have to rely increasingly on macroprudential instruments to manage the credit
cycle and to counter potential surges in capital inflows. In the medium term, fiscal policy
should focus on saving a share of hydrocarbon wealth for intergenerational equity.
Fiscal policy stance
11.
The authorities noted that their countercyclical fiscal stance has been
instrumental in maintaining high growth rates during the global crisis. The
government’s focus on developing the physical and social infrastructure will continue over
the medium-term. Large investments valued at about $100 billion between 2010 and 2015 are
in various stages of planning and implementation. Although hydrocarbon revenues are
projected to be lower on average at 52 percent of total revenues over the medium term,
compared to 58 percent of total revenues over the last five years (2005/06 to 2009/10), the
share of non-tax revenue will rise with investment income from public enterprises projected
to remain stable around 26 percent of total revenues. This will enable the government to
continue with its infrastructure investment plans.
12.
Nevertheless, the authorities agreed with staff that the projected high growth
rates warrant careful monitoring of aggregate demand to ward off risks of inflation,
going back to the high levels experienced before the global crisis. The authorities recalled
that the previous episode of high inflation was mainly due to supply bottlenecks and rising
rents. The current situation of excess supply in real estate and the considerable easing of
supply bottlenecks in raw materials—a result of increased investments in these sectors—have
greatly reduced inflation risks in the short term. In this context, the authorities’ are well
aware of the importance of keeping current expenditure in check.
13.
Much of the infrastructure-related expenditures related to hosting the FIFA
World Cup in 2022 had already been planned notwithstanding the success of their bid,
or are under implementation. The increase in expenditure related to this event, such as
building stadiums, do not seem to have a significant impact on their surpluses in the
benchmark scenario. Moreover, the government has 12 years to plan and manage any
additional expenditure while avoiding an overheating of the economy.

14
14.
Staff supports the authorities’ current fiscal expansionary stance in view of the
existing fiscal space and the low probability of an oil price shock.10 The main challenge,
however relates to the evolution of nonhydrocarbon revenues in view of the authorities’
intentions to diversify the economy and develop the nonhydrocarbon sector. In this context,
staff welcomed the recently introduced measures to rationalize and broaden the corporate tax
base. The establishment of the value-added tax in the context of the GCC monetary union
would broaden the tax base further.
15.
Preserving macroeconomic stabilization and the government’s policy of saving a
share of hydrocarbon wealth is key to facilitating intergenerational equity. The policy of
saving a share of the hydrocarbon wealth through the sovereign wealth fund has served Qatar
well. Apart from acting as a tool for sterilization, it created fiscal room for a large
countercyclical response to the crisis. Fiscal policy will need to continue to maintain a
careful balance between spending on infrastructure to sustain non-inflationary growth, and
saving and investing part of hydrocarbon surpluses abroad in order to generate sufficient
income to finance future budgets.
16.
Staff noted that pursuing fiscal consolidation in the medium term would mitigate
the impact of any sharp fall in hydrocarbon prices and help attain the authorities’
objective of fully financing the budget from 2020 onwards from its nonhydrocarbon
revenues. The current stance of fiscal policy goes in this direction. In the staff’s baseline
scenario, income earned from the sovereign wealth fund would cover capital expenditure,
which is roughly about 40 percent of total expenditure in 2015/16. Combined with projected
tax revenues, non hydrocarbon revenues are projected to cover about 73 percent of total
expenditure in 2015/16 (Figure 5).11 A careful reappraisal of future projects of governmentowned companies, particularly in the real estate sector, rationalizing energy subsidies, and
diversifying the revenue base would therefore be appropriate.

10

Staff’s fiscal sustainability exercise indicates space for further spending. The exercise targets a constant per
capita annuity in real terms. The key parameters are calibrated as follows; (a) 27 billion barrels of oil reserves
and 18.7 billion tons of gas reserves; (b) an initial government debt level of $36 billion; (c) annual population
growth rate of 1.7 percent; and (e) a real interest rate of 4 percent.
11

The calculations are based on the oil price assumptions of the latest World Economic Outlook for
accumulation of SWF assets until 2015. A return on investment of 7 percent per annum has been assumed on
the assets.

15

16
Monetary policy
17.
The slowdown in bank credit to the private sector reflects both demand and
supply factors. Following high domestic credit growth rates averaging over 50 percent a
year in the pre-crisis period (2004–08), the dampening of credit growth is to some
extent natural. Nevertheless, the slowdown in domestic credit has not dampened the
nonhydrocarbon growth engines, which are mainly sustained by government and
government-owned corporate investments.12 Credit to the public sector has continued to
increase. The stagnation in credit to consumption, and contractors and real estate sectors
could be attributed in part to central bank regulation that halted consumption credit for
equity investments, and the increased risk aversion of banks after the global crisis.13
Notwithstanding this, a survey conducted by QCB of lending behavior of banks highlighted
stricter credit assessments after the crisis.
18.
Staff concurs with the authorities’ view that credit growth will accelerate, given
the large ongoing government-led investments and the measures taken by the
authorities to strengthen bank capitalization. Moreover, continued growth in the nonoil
sector will provide additional demand for credit. QCB reduced its policy deposit rate by
50 basis points in August 2010—for the first time since April 2008—attributing it among
others to dissuade banks from placing deposits with the central bank and instead explore
credit opportunities. Staff supports the reduction in the rate, given the room to reduce interest
rate differentials compared to U.S. and other GCC countries’ interest rates, the benign
headline inflation, and the relatively low credit growth in the economy. The commencement
of operations of the central bank’s credit bureau will increase transparency, promote
information sharing among banks, and help reduce investor risk aversion (Box 1).
19.
The main challenges for monetary policy will be to support credit growth
without fuelling inflationary pressures or short-term capital inflows. QCB is closely
monitoring liquidity in the financial system and has a range of instruments, including
certificates of deposit and reserve requirements, to manage it. Given the pegged exchange
rate regime, the central bank will have to rely increasingly on macroprudential instruments to
manage the credit cycle and to counter potential surges in capital flows, which it is ready to
use when warranted.

12

Qatari Diar, a real estate subsidiary of Qatar Investment Authority raised $3.5 billion in 2010 through a
government guaranteed bond issuance. Most of the proceeds from the issuance are meant to finance the
development of large-scale real-estate projects in Qatar undertaken by Barwa, which is 45 percent owned by
Qatari Diar, and also repay certain debts incurred by Barwa.
13

The Government and Government-owned enterprises have ensured the completion of real estate projects by
providing guarantees for financing, and by renting upcoming apartment buildings and purchasing office space
directly from developers to alleviate their cash flow problems.

17

Cross country evidence points to the beneficial effects of credit bureaus on credit access to
consumers and small and medium enterprises (SMEs).2 Another study covering 129 countries found
a 7 to 8 percentage point increase in private bank credit as a share of GDP over a five-year period
following the introduction of public credit registries and private credit bureaus.3
Credit bureaus have continued to grow globally
in 2008 and 2009. Several countries introduced
regulations guaranteeing that borrowers can inspect
data in credit information registries (Colombia,
Guatemala, Serbia, and the Republic of Yemen);
expanded set of information collected by credit
registries (Egypt, Greece, Latvia, Turkey, and
Zambia); or improved the regulatory framework for
sharing credit information (Armenia, Honduras,
Kenya, Mauritius, Nigeria, Philippines, and
Tajikistan).

The ability of credit bureaus to improve financial intermediation, however, depends on the extent of
information coverage, particularly from non-bank sources. Key challenges are to create a legal
structure that allows the sharing of credit information between various institutions, and to broaden
the scope of credit information to capture both positive and negative aspects of creditworthiness.

Exchange rate policy and exchange rate assessment
20.
Qatar’s exchange rate appears broadly in line with fundamentals, although the
results of the CGER-type analysis are somewhat mixed (Box 2). Nevertheless, it will be
important to enhance the technical, institutional, and operational capacity, in case an
alternative exchange rate regime becomes desirable in the context of the GCC monetary
union. In this context, the mission welcomes the authorities’ intention to develop the
domestic bond market. This entails addressing regulatory and market infrastructure to foster
demand for instruments and build the supply of securities.
Box 2. Exchange Rate Assessment
The equilibrium effective exchange rate approach shows that the fall in oil prices
(35 percent) and the deflation (4.9 percent) in 2009 contributed to reversing the gap between the
equilibrium exchange rate and the real effective exchange rate that prevailed in 2008.1 In 2009,
the estimated equilibrium exchange rate showed a slight overvaluation of about 6 percent. The
recovery of oil prices in 2010 along with the smaller deflation is likely to narrow the extent of
overvaluation.
The Macroeconomic Balance (MB) and External Sustainability (ES) approaches yield
mixed results. The MB analysis

Countries where primary commodities dominate exports, fluctuations in world commodity prices should explain
most of the movements in their terms of trade yielding a ―commodity currency‖ (see Chen and Rogoff, 2002, and
Cashin, Cespedes, and Sahay, 2002). Following this approach, a cointegration relationship between the logarithm
of the REER, the logarithm of the real oil prices and the growth rate of government expenditure is found.

Assumes a population growth of 1.7 percent and a real interest rate of 4.5 percent.

21.
The authorities are strongly committed to the dollar peg. They hold the view that
the current level of the exchange rate is appropriate. Staff is of the view that the dollar peg
has served Qatar well as an effective nominal anchor. The authorities are not overly
concerned about the reemergence of inflationary pressures in the near future, since they have
excess capacity in real estate. Rent comprises a significant component of the consumer price
basket.

19
B. Financial Sector Issues
22.
Stress tests indicate that the banking system is resilient to credit and market
risks. The updated stress tests show a marginal increase in risk on bank capital of a
combined credit and market stress at end-June 2010 (after Government support amounting
to about 7 percent of GDP), compared to end-2008 (before the impact of the global crisis was
fully felt).14 The results show that recapitalization needs of the banking system would be
about 2 to 3 percent of GDP even under a severe combined stress of an increase in NPLs
to 20 percent and a drop in the value of investments by 50 percent. The authorities broadly
agreed with this assessment as it was similar to the results of the stress tests conducted by
QCB. The mission encouraged the central bank to widen the scope of the stress tests to cover
cross border, contagion and concentration risks. Staff’s analysis also suggests that Qatari
corporates would appear to be well cushioned to withstand shocks.15
23.
QCB is closely monitoring potential risks to the banking system through its
recently established Financial Stability Unit. The central bank has a number of prudential
regulations in place to reduce banks’ exposure to risky assets. Such measures include, among
others, a credit ratio that limits bank credit growth, limits on real estate financing by banks, a
ban on bank financing for trading in securities, a limit on banks’ proprietary investments in
equity, and limit on foreign currency exposure of banks. The mission welcomed QCB’s
intention to pursue stress testing of banks on an ongoing basis.

14

To distinguish between banks that hold a relatively safe portfolio from that with riskier lending strategies, the
balance sheets of the major eight Qatari listed banks were disaggregated into three components, viz., (i) risky
loans (comprising loans to the private sector and one-half of the loans to consumers); (ii) risky market portfolios
(all portfolio investments available for sale); (iii) all other assets (loans to the government, and one-half of
consumer loans), which are not shocked in the stress test. The value of risky loans was assumed to suffer from
NPLs, rising from 1 percentage point to 20 percentage points above the baseline (with a Loss Given Default
(LGD) ratio at 0.75), and the value of risky portfolio assets was shocked with losses up to 50 percent.
15

Distance-to-Default (DtD) indicators were calculated for the banking sector, and for the listed corporate
sector comprising industrial, services and insurance companies. The results indicated that even though these
sectors were affected by the global crisis, their risk of default was low. The charts in the text show the direct
correlation between the DtD and the movement of equity in the market. As is expected, they move together
(a high value of equity means that markets are assigning a strong probability that the future value of assets
exceed its debt). The noticeable narrowing of DtD in June 2009 is due to market capitalization values dropping
substantially compared to the previous year.

24.
The authorities and staff agreed on the importance of reducing moral hazard and
fostering a sound risk management culture in the banking system. The authorities supported
the banking system in 2009 through two rounds of capitalization, and purchase of local
equity and real estate assets from banks. They have decided to deviate from the
preannounced exit strategy of selling the portfolio back to banks within three to five years at
the sale price, and instead transfer the equity portfolio to the Government pension fund at a
future date. And they plan to retain the real estate portfolio, much of which is abroad. Staff is
of the view that the ex post decision not to resell the equity assets to banks is desirable as this
reduces moral hazard. The lessons learnt from the crisis underscore the importance of
building banks’ capacity to assess risks, greater information sharing among them, and
improving corporate governance and transparency.
25.
Staff sees merit in complementing regulatory reforms at the national level with
the implementation of global regulatory reforms. QCB plans to implement Basel III early.
Almost all banks are above the minimum threshold for the common equity requirement of
4.5 percent, and all banks have Tier 1 capital over the prescribed 6 percent under Basel III.
The commitment to establish a single regulator for the financial system under the umbrella of
the central bank is an appropriate response to addressing regulatory and supervisory gaps and
strengthening financial sector reforms. Staff compliments the authorities for significant
improvements to the AML/CFT regime and welcomes Qatar’s delisting from the
International Cooperation Review Group (ICRG).16 Staff encourages the authorities to build
upon progress accomplished and pursue their efforts in this area. 17
16

In 2006, the FATF adopted a new monitoring process - the International Cooperation Review Group–to
identify, examine and engage with vulnerable jurisdictions that are failing to implement effective AML/CFT
systems.
17

The State enacted the new AML/CFT law on April 30, 2010. A Financial Supervisory Coordination
Committee framed harmonized rules and regulations, which were adopted by the various financial sector
supervisors between May and June 2010.

21
C. Developing Institutions to Support Policy
26.
Staff supports the authorities’ plan to create a macro-fiscal unit in the Ministry
of Economy and Finance to help develop a medium-term budget framework. The
authorities’ recognize that their National Development Strategy needs to be supported with
institutional measures to better align the annual budgets with medium-term priorities. Staff
encouraged the authorities to strengthen the public financial management framework, and to
conduct a review of the efficiency of spending, particularly in view of the large capital
expenditure program.
27.
The authorities and staff shared the view on the need for setting up an
institutional framework for debt management. Staff noted that the authorities have made
some initial advances in preparing a framework for setting up a debt office along with efforts
to collate and disseminate debt statistics. Staff also encouraged the authorities to proceed
with their plans to develop the domestic bond market. The benefits of a well diversified
financial system are well known. The government’s objectives would be better achieved by
consolidating debt management and development functions in a debt office (Appendix II).
D. Enhancing Productivity to Sustain Long-term Growth
28.
The authorities agreed with staff’s assessment that improving productivity
would be key to self-sustaining long-term growth in the nonhydrocarbon sectors. Staff’s
preliminary growth accounting exercise reveals that the rate of change in total factor
productivity (TFP) in Qatar contributed negatively to real GDP growth over the period
2000–07 (Appendix III).18 A plausible explanation is that labor is concentrated in sectors
with low productivity gains, and in particular in construction. Since, Qatar’s constant
hydrocarbon production after 2012 would limit the government’s overall capacity to finance
investments, it would be crucial to improve productivity if sustainable growth is to be
attained. The authorities feel that a share of the low productivity might be the natural
outcome of the current phase of the development strategy of Qatar, which focuses on the
building of physical infrastructure by using unskilled labor. They argued that as Qatar moves
to higher value added sectors with skilled labor replacing unskilled labor, improvement in
productivity would occur.
29.
The main challenge will be to move from low-skilled to high-skilled labor in the
long term, and to ensure efficiency of expenditure to improve productivity. Qatar’s main
challenge will be to provide the institutional framework to encourage investment in
18

Labor productivity in building and construction—which employed more than 37 percent of the labor force in
2007—declined at an average annual rate of 0.5 percent over the period 2001–07. In the manufacturing sector—
the second largest sector in terms of employment—labor productivity declined at an average annual rate of
1.4 percent. The contribution of TFP gains to growth in Qatar compares with about 1 percent in advanced
countries and higher than 3 percent in fast growing emerging economies.

22
innovation. They agreed that ensuring the efficiency of expenditure will also contribute to
improving productivity. The authorities are focusing on private participation in the delivery
of economic and social infrastructure to induce substantial efficiency gains to remain
globally competitive. As part of this strategy, a recently issued Government decree
established a Public Private Partnership (PPP) Department within the Ministry of Business
and Trade.19
V. MONETARY UNION
30.
Much progress has been achieved in establishing the GCC monetary union.
Qatar along with Bahrain, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia has ratified the charter establishing the
GCC Monetary Council. Qatar also shifted the base year of the CPI from 2006 to 2007 with a
view to standardizing the base year of CPI index for the GCC monetary union. In a step to
improve the quality of macroeconomic statistics, the GCC monetary council recently agreed
to establish a statistical center named GulfStat with the main objectives of standardizing data
collection and dissemination. Nevertheless, important tasks remain, including the setting of
the monetary policy framework, identifying a common payment and settlement systems, and
unifying the banking supervision system in member countries. On the fiscal side, setting up a
common accounting framework and adequate budgetary procedures is of high priority in the
phase leading up to the introduction of a common currency.
VI. STATISTICAL ISSUES
31.
While progress has been made in improving data quality and coverage, there is
scope to improve timeliness, quality, and periodicity of all strands of economic data.
Staff underlined the need for greater coordination among the various ministries, QCB, Qatar
Statistical Authority and the General Secretariat for Development Planning, among others, in
this regard. Staff noted that the authorities are striving to improve the quality and coverage of
general economic statistics. The authorities recognize the shortcomings in their national
accounts and inflation data and sought IMF technical assistance (TA) in the area of
compilation of the consumer price index. The authorities lack capacity in the compilation of
the international investment position statistics. They recently received technical assistance on
the financial account of the balance of payments, and are preparing a roadmap for the
implementation of the recommendations of the TA mission.
VII. STAFF APPRAISAL
32.
Qatar continues to be one of the fastest growing economies in the world. A doubling
of natural gas capacity, timely intervention by the authorities in the banking system, and

19

The mandate of the PPP department is to advise on partnership polices, identify sectors where such
partnerships can be developed, prepare samples or models of PPP contracts in accordance with local and
international standards and recommend measures to support and stimulate PPP in Qatar.

23
ongoing large public investments across the supply chain have placed Qatar on a high growth
trajectory.
33.
Staff supports the expansionary fiscal stance in 2010/11. Although spending has
increased substantially, fiscal buffers remain and fiscal sustainability is not at issue in the
medium term. Nevertheless, non-rent inflation could reemerge, and hence aggregate demand
should be carefully monitored in order to ward off inflation going back to the high levels
experienced before the global crisis.
34.
The main challenge for monetary policy will be to support credit growth without
fuelling inflationary pressures or short-term capital inflows. QCB has room to further
reduce interest rates, if warranted. Given the pegged exchange rate regime, the central bank
will have to rely increasingly on macroprudential instruments to manage the credit cycle and
to counter potential surges in capital flows.
35.
The authorities should continue to save and invest part of hydrocarbon
surpluses abroad over the medium term. This will help attain multiple objectives of
containing domestic demand pressures and facilitating intergenerational equity, as well as
mitigating the impact of any sharp fall in hydrocarbon prices. Staff supports the thrust of
increasing spending for infrastructure investments. Containing current expenditures and
increasing the tax base would form an integral part of the strategy of reducing their
dependence on hydrocarbon revenues.
36.
Improving productivity is key to greater self-sustaining long-term growth in the
nonhydrocarbon sectors. Investing in higher education and entrepreneurship, identifying
policies to encourage innovation, and ushering in a change of paradigm in the migrant labor
market, would contribute to productivity gains. Ensuring the efficiency of expenditure will
also contribute to improving productivity during the transition.
37.
Strengthening institutions to support policy should be part of the medium-term
strategy. The planned macro-fiscal unit in the Ministry of Economy and Finance should be
pursued to help develop a medium-term budget framework and support macroeconomic
policy formulation. The rising debt levels of sovereign and government-owned enterprises’
underscore the need for setting up an institutional framework for debt management.
38.
Staff supports the authorities’ decision to maintain the dollar peg, but encourages
the authorities to enhance the technical, institutional, and operational capacity, in case an
alternative exchange rate regime becomes desirable in the context of the GCC monetary
union. The assessment of the level of the exchange rate suggests that the riyal is broadly
aligned with its fundamentals.
39.
Staff underscores the importance of reducing moral hazard and instituting a sound
risk assessment culture in the banking system. The lessons learnt from the global crisis
highlight the importance of building capacity in banks to assess risks, encouraging greater

24
information sharing among them, and improving corporate governance and transparency. The
commitment to establish a single regulator for the financial system under the umbrella of the
central bank is an appropriate response to addressing regulatory and supervisory gaps and
strengthening financial sector reforms.
40.
Further efforts are required to improve the statistical systems, including the
quality, timeliness, and coverage. There is a need for greater coordination among the
various ministries, QCB, Qatar Statistical Authority and the General Secretariat for
Development Planning in this regard.
41.
The next Article IV consultation is expected to take place on the standard
12-month cycle.

APPENDIX I. MEDIUM-TERM PROSPECTS IN QATAR’S LNG SECTOR1
The projected glut in global gas supply and reduced need for imports by the U.S. could see
some shift in the way conventional gas is priced and traded. In the medium term, there could
be pressures from Europe and Asia to move away from oil-linked long-term contracts to spot
prices. The downside risk to the medium-term economic outlook of Qatar is tilted toward
lower gas prices vis-à-vis a contraction of demand for gas.
I. Qatar’s LNG Strategy
1.
Qatar is leading the massive worldwide increase in LNG production. Qatar
accounts for the bulk of the increase, which is likely to alter the LNG market. 2

Qatar holds the third largest reserves of natural gas in the world, concentrated in the North Gas field, the
largest non-associated gas reservoir in the world. It is an off-shore field discovered in 1971 on the border with
Iran’s South Pars field. Qatar Petroleum (QP) plays a dominant role in the natural gas sector in both upstream
and downstream production. Qatar’s strategy is focused on ―mega-projects‖ and vertical integration including
downstream natural gas intensive industries like fertilizer of gas-to-liquid projects (GTL) in partnership with oil
companies (ExxonMobil, Shell, and Total, ConocoPhillips). Qatar Gas Transport Company Ltd. (Nakilat),
handles all the shipping of Qatari LNG.

33
2.
Unlike the global oil market, the global natural gas market is still segmented.
There exist large differences in natural gas prices and contract arrangements across
continents. About one-third of global gas consumption is priced on a spot basis, one-fifth is
indexed to crude oil, around 40 percent is subject to direct price regulation, and the
remaining is sold at subsidized prices (IEA 2009). Contracts on Asian and European markets
tend to be indexed to oil prices, while the more integrated U.S. market follows the spot price
(gas-to-gas competition). Thus, the low U.S. gas prices ($4–6 per million British Thermal
Unit (MBTU)) and the fall in the expected U.S. LNG imports for 2009–10, in particular from
Qatar, did not dramatically affect LNG exporters’ revenue. Qatar was able to redirect its
production destined for the U.S. market toward Asian, European and even Latin American
markets at higher prices ($10–12 per MBTU) due to diversion clauses in the contracts.
II. DEVELOPMENTS IN SHALE GAS
3.
Nonconventional gas resources have started to alter market conditions.
Nonconventional gas accounts for less than 5 percent of global natural gas reserves, but
12 percent of global production. An increase in shale gas production in the U.S. combined
with the global contraction of demand depressed global gas prices in 2009. The potential
reserves (and resources) are large and many other countries have started exploring shale gas
resources. In the past decade, shale gas has emerged as a major new source of gas supply in
the U.S., accounting for about 46 percent of total U.S. production (Energy Information
Agency, 2010). The U.S. became the largest gas producer in 2009, and accounts for three
quarters of global nonconventional output. A recent report estimates U.S. recoverable
reserves at 650 trillion cubic feet, equivalent to about 30 years of 2009 consumption.3 The
potential reserves are large and well spread over the world.4
4.
The projected glut in global gas supply and reduced need for imports by the
U.S. could see some shift in the way conventional gas is priced and traded globally.
Considerable increase in LNG production in the next few years, accompanied with the sharp
increase in LNG tankers, and an increase in production from shale gas in the U.S. are likely
to affect conventional gas producers that rely on oil indexed long-term contracts and pipeline
transportation. Countries in Asia, including China and India, Europe and Latin America have
filled in the space vacated by U.S. imports, particularly with regard to LNG. The effect of
shale gas supply on the U.S. market could be linked to the recent ―decoupling‖ of natural gas
prices. The energy equivalence parity of oil and gas is such that natural gas price per MBTU
3

There is growing interest in exploiting unconventional sources of gas, using new techniques at lower costs.
Many other countries have started exploring potentially large shale gas resources including Canada, India,
China, Australia, Germany, Hungary, Poland and the United Kingdom. Two factors have made shale gas
production economically viable: advances in horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing (creating fractures in
the rock and injecting a fluid to increase permeability).

34
should be a sixth of the oil price per barrel. The figure below shows that parity was fairly
respected in the U.S. market until late 2005 and large divergences appeared thereafter.

Oil price parity ($/MBTU)

There are potential obstacles to shale gas drilling. The cost of exploitation, and therefore
the true potential, is difficult to estimate given the high variability of production rates
between shale plays and between wells within the same shale play.5 The main limitations
include the physical access to resources, the requirement of large volumes of water, and
environmental regulations, particularly relating to the contamination of water resources with
fracture fluids. Lack of adequate capacity in the vicinity of shale gas play may also deter
investments.
III. IMPACT ON QATAR
5.
The above developments indicate heightening tail risks for natural gas prices.
Although we keep our baseline scenario of gas prices anchored to the WEO projection of oil
prices in the medium term, we study scenarios where the reference hydrocarbon price we use
falls substantially. In the first scenario, a -30 percent shock takes place in 2011, then the
growth rate of the WEO oil price projections is retained; in the second scenario, two 30 percent shocks are compounded over the first two years.

5

At 2007 cost, M.I.T. (2010) estimates that the break-even price for the exploitation of shale gas is in the range
of $4 to 8 per million cubic feet. The Henry Hub spot price for 2009/10 has been moving within the break-even
range explaining the persistence of production growth after the price collapse in 2009.

Our macroeconomic scenarios in the face of a drop in hydrocarbon prices
emphasize the sensitivity of the fiscal and external current accounts. Alternative
macroeconomic frameworks based on the two alternative scenarios, indicate the following
(Figure 4): (i) the average medium-term external current account surplus declines sharply
from 20 percent of GDP per year during 2011–15 to 5.8 percent under the first scenario of a
one-time shock to oil prices of -30 percent; in the case of two-consecutive declines at a rate
of -30 percent in oil prices, the current account shows deficits as early as 2012 and the
average medium-term current account surplus turns into a deficit of 6 percent of GDP a year;
and (ii) reflecting the decline in the current account balance, the flow of cash to the state
(which averaged some $70 billion per year under the baseline scenario) shrinks
correspondingly—by 30 percent under the first scenario to $49 billion and by 47 percent to
$37 billion per year in the event of two consecutive declines in oil prices.

APPENDIX II. SOVEREIGN DEBT MANAGEMENT IN QATAR—NEED FOR A
FORMAL INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK1
Qatar’s external borrowings increased sharply after the crisis. The sovereign issued several
tranches of bonds with a view to creating a sovereign benchmark yield curve, followed by
issuances by government-owned corporates. Absence of reliable debt statistics and lack of a
formal institutional framework to evaluate the cost-risk tradeoffs could pose risks to
macromanagement—notwithstanding Qatar’s large external assets—as events in the region
have shown. The authorities are also keen to develop the domestic bond market. The benefits
of a well diversified financial system are well known. The government’s objectives would be
better achieved by consolidating debt management and development functions in a debt
office.
I. QATAR’S DEBT PROFILE

Qatar’s external borrowings increased sharply after the crisis. Led by the
government, which issued sovereign bonds in April and November 2009, there was a flurry
of external borrowings by corporates.2 Total external debt increased by 80 percent between

Qatar is also trying to build a domestic sovereign bond yield curve. Although the
government is running large fiscal surpluses, it has issued a number of conventional and
Islamic bonds in 2009–10, with a view to facilitating the development of a domestic bond
market.

Debt and debt service ratios are at comfortable levels. External debt primarily
consists of long term bonds and borrowings. There are no immediate rollover risks. The
nonavailability of comprehensive information on the total external debt, however, limits a

II. CURRENT POLICY AND LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR SOVEREIGN DEBT
4.
Qatar has a legal framework to undertake sovereign borrowings, issue islamic
notes and extend guarantees. The ability of the Qatari government to borrow and provide
guarantees is addressed by Law No. (2) of 1962, as amended by Decree Law No. 19 of 1996
(the ―Financial Policy Law‖), and the Constitution. Law No. (18) of 2002 on Public Debt and
Islamic Finance Notes, as amended by Law No. 22 of 2009, (the ―Public Debt Law‖)
authorizes the State to borrow and issue public debt and Islamic Finance notes.
5.
The legal framework in Qatar is, however, narrowly focused on borrowing type
rather than analytical aspects of strategy development and evaluation. The law provides
a clear authorization to the Minister of Economy and Finance to borrow and issue new debt
and loan guarantees. It further elaborates that the purposes, objectives, amount, maturity and
the instrument type for each internal and external debt (conventional and Islamic) must be
determined by the Minister after consulting with the central bank. There is, however, no
mandate to develop a debt management strategy taking into account total public sector debt
and analyzing the same through rigorous cost-risk tradeoffs of the debt portfolio. Such
elements, including evaluation by parliament, are found in Sweden, New Zealand, United
Kingdom, Australia, Denmark, Finland, and France.

40
6.
Inter-agency coordination is fostered to some extent by the State Finance Policy
Committee, but there is no institutionalized debt management structure. The Committee
comprises the minister as chairman, a representative of QCB as deputy chairman, and
representatives of the Qatar Investment Authority and Qatar Petroleum. The role of the
Committee is to (a) provide guidance to all government related entities that seek access to the
international capital markets, and (b) coordinate debt offerings by Qatari issuers in order to
increase liquidity and optimize borrowing costs. A clear division between the political level
that sets the overall long term debt management objectives and strategy, and entities
responsible for implementing the strategy does not exist. The advantages of having a clear
institutional approach are that it leaves major decisions regarding the overall size of debt with
political decision makers, while allowing technical professionals to seek the optimum riskadjusted outcome within those parameters.
III. NEED FOR A FORMAL INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK FOR DEBT MANAGEMENT
7.
A design of a comprehensive debt strategy and a clearer distinction between the
formation of high-level policy objectives and the day-to-day implementation of those
objectives is appropriate for Qatar at this juncture. Taking a more strategic approach to
evaluating financing choices requires greater integration of debt management strategy
formulation and broader macroeconomic management. A medium term debt management
strategy would be useful for illustrating the government’s cost and risk tradeoffs and for
managing the risk exposure embedded in a debt portfolio, in particular the potential variation
in debt servicing costs due to exogenous developments and their budgetary impact. These
aims are best met by consolidating debt management functions into one operating unit.3
8.
Developed and emerging countries operate through formal debt management
strategies (e.g., Denmark, Sweden, New Zealand, Brazil, Colombia, Poland). Although each
government’s goals are unique, common among them are the development of the capacity to
raise the required amount of funding within the government’s risk and cost parameters, as
well the development and maintenance of an efficient market for government debt
securities.4
9.
Qatar could benefit from the formulation of clear guidelines for: establishing a
legal framework (that specifies clear borrowing purposes and a mandate to develop a debt
management strategy), a managerial structure (that establishes division of responsibility
3

IMF and World Bank, March 2001, Guidelines for Public Debt Management define sovereign debt
management as the process of establishing and executing a strategy for managing the government’s debt in
order to meet its borrowing requirements within its risk and cost objectives, and to meet any other sovereign
debt management goals the government may have set, such as developing and maintaining an efficient market
for government securities.

between policy formulation and implementation), a strategy (that is based on the longer-term
debt management objectives and set within the context of the government’s fiscal policy and
budget framework), an audit evaluation (for fixing accountability), coordination with
macroeconomic policies (monetary and fiscal), evolving limits for guarantees, setting
procedures and a framework for cash management, operational risk, and debt recording
systems.

APPENDIX III. WHY SHOULD QATAR FOCUS ON PRODUCTIVITY GAINS?1
Hydrocarbon production is projected to reach a plateau in 2012, emphasizing the
importance of productivity gains to achieve sustainable non-hydrocarbon growth in the
medium term. A growth accounting analysis shows that Qatar’s productivity growth was on
average negative over 2000–07, emphasizing the need for structural reforms to improve the
efficiency of spending. The main challenge facing Qatar will be to manage the transition
from its economic model based on short term unskilled workers mainly employed in
construction to longer term skilled workers employed in innovative firms.
I. SECTORAL GROWTH PROFILE
1.
Qatar’s growth engines have been powered by public expenditure supported by
immigrant labor. The economy started growing at a strong pace in the mid-nineties when
the LNG sector started its spectacular expansion, unfettering large resources for the
government. The hydrocarbon GDP grew at an average rate of about 11 percent between
1990 and 2009, as public spending grew at an average rate of about 9 percent while nonhydrocarbon grew at an average rate of 9.5 percent. Qatar’s population increased to
1.6 million at end-August 2010, recording an average 7.5 percent growth rate during this
period.

The services sector dominates the nonhydrocarbon economy. Although building
and construction is relatively smaller, and constitutes 13 percent of the non hydrocarbon
sector, it is the main employer in the economy and also one of the fastest growing.

3.
Beyond 2012, the non-hydrocarbon sector will drive real GDP growth. As a result
of a self-imposed moratorium on exploration in the North field, hydrocarbon production will
reach a plateau in 2012, as will the fiscal space for spending.

4.
Sustainable growth will have to come from productivity gains in the future.
Diversification is even more important in this context, as a fall in oil prices cannot be
mitigated by an increase in hydrocarbon production after 2012. To perpetuate the same
model while drawing down the net foreign assets is not sustainable, as shown by the
experience of the oil bust of the 1980s.

44
5.
Diversification and productivity are interlinked through two channels. To make a
sustained entry in a new industry requires productivity gains. On the other hand, to counter
the Dutch disease effect, productivity in the tradable sector should be increased to compete
with the non-tradable sector for resources.2
II. GROWTH ACCOUNTING
6.

Methodology

In this section, we describe the methodology and data used to conduct growth accounting.3
Following Hall and Jones (1999), we adopt a benchmark Cobb-Douglas technology such
that:

where Y is GDP, A is TFP, K is the aggregate capital stock, L is the number of workers, h is
the average human capital such that Lh represents the ―quality adjusted‖ workforce. α is a
constant in [0,1].
Output growth can be decomposed as follows:

where
or the residual of how much of the variation in income is driven by variation in the factors of
production on an annual basis between 1970 and 2000. The cross-country data requirement to
conduct growth accounting for each country is the following: a measure of output; a measure
of the stock of physical capital; and a measure of the ―quality adjusted‖ workforce. We also
need a value for α.
7.

Data

Following Caselli (2005), we construct a measure of the stock of physical capital, output, and
the number of workers from version 6.3 of the Penn World Tables [PWT63]. From Barro and
Lee (2010), we obtain educational attainment data.
We measure y (real GDP per worker) in PPP terms. To compute the stock of capital, K, at
each point in time, we use the perpetual inventory equation:
2

Cherif (2008) shows that in a model of bilateral trade, the marginal crowding out effect of international
transfers (interpreted as oil revenue) on the tradable sector will depend on the productivity differential vis-a-vis
the trading partner.

), where I0 is
investment in the first year it is available, and g is the geometric average growth rate of
investment between the first year the series is available and 1970.5 We include countries with
data availability since 1960. We append the method to include GCC countries based on the
assumption that initial capital in 1950 in all GCC countries is zero and the growth rate of
investment is 10 percent.
Following Hall and Jones (1999), we compute a measure of human capital h using the
formula:

where s is the average years of schooling in the population over 25 years of age, taken from
Barro and Lee (2001) and the function Φ(s) is piecewise linear.6 The goal of using this
functional form is to produce a log-linear relationship between years of schooling and wage
given the production function chosen and under perfect competition both in factor and goods
markets. In addition, Hall and Jones choose Φ(s) to be consistent with differences in the
return to schooling across countries found in Psacharopoulos (1994).7
We assume α to be 1/3 for all countries, which is consistent with U.S. time-series data,
except for the GCC countries, where we assume α to be ½, translating the high share of
capital in total payment. As a result, we construct an annual series for physical capital stock,
output, and education for a large number of countries between 1970 and 2007.8
8.

Results

Productivity growth in Qatar is negative. Figure 4 shows the average TFP growth over the
period 2000–07 against logarithm of average GDP per capita over the same period for a
group of advanced countries with similar wealth to the GCC countries. Figure 5 shows the
4

Both GDP and investment are measured using the chain method.

5

This method is a standard practice in the literature (see, for example, Hall and Jones, 1999, and Caselli, 2005);
The intuition behind it is that I /(g+ ) corresponds to capital stock in the steady state of the Solow growth
model.
6

Φ(s)=0.134*s if s≤4, Φ(s)=0.134*4 +0.101*(s-4) if 4<s≤8, Φ(s)=0.134.4+0.101*4+0.068*(s-8) if 8<s.

average TFP growth against the average growth rate of per capita real GDP over 2000–07 for
all countries in the sample. There is a strong positive correlation between the average growth
rate of per capita GDP and average TFP growth. Qatar is again an outlier as it has a relatively
high growth rate while its average productivity growth is exceptionally low.

Table 1 shows the results of the growth accounting of GCC countries over 2000–07
compared with selected advanced countries. As a reference, we choose a major oil exporter
(Norway), a fast growing non resource-rich country (Singapore), and the United States. GCC
countries have higher growth overall, mainly explained by capital expansion. Growth in both
labor and physical capital are higher in GCC countries while human capital contributions are
similar. On the other hand, TFP growth is negative in Qatar. In comparison, Norway and the
U.S. have relatively small but positive TFP growths with 0.6 and 0.7 percent respectively. In
both cases, capital growth is the biggest contributor to growth. However, Singapore’s growth
is mainly explained by its productivity gains with a TFP growth of 2.8 percent.

Table 2 shows the growth accounting decomposition for GCC countries for the periods
1970–79, 1980–89 and 1990–99. Qatar’s average TFP growth is positive in the 1970s
(1.2 percent), negative in the 1980s (-2.3 percent) and positive again in the 90s (2.6 percent).
The growth of the labor force is particularly high during the same period reflecting the
decrease in the infant mortality rates in the two previous decades.

III. WHY IS PRODUCTIVITY LOW?
9.
Labor is concentrated in sectors with low productivity gains. Building and
construction is the fastest growing sector and employs the largest share of employment with
more than 37 percent of the labor force in 2007 (Figure 6). Labor productivity (growth of
output per worker) in construction decreased at an average annual rate of 0.5 percent over the
period 2001–07. The second largest sector in terms of employment, excluding the public
sector and households’ employment, is manufacturing. Labor productivity in manufacturing
decreased at an average annual rate of 1.4 percent. In contrast, labor productivity in services
grew at a rate of 2.8 percent in trade restaurants and hotels and 6.1 percent in finance,
insurance and real estate. The relatively big share of the public sector and household
employment also contributes to the low level of productivity growth.

Qatar’s human capital is low relative to its wealth. Figure 7 shows the average
years of schooling in the population over 15 against average GDP over the period 2000–07.
While there is a strong positive correlation, Qatar and Kuwait are outliers with high GDP per
capita and relatively low average years of schooling. The concentration of activity in
construction and household employment, which are unskilled labor intensive, explains in part
the low level of average human capital.

IV. HOW TO IMPROVE PRODUCTIVITY?
11.
Improving the efficiency of fiscal spending could help improve productivity
during the transition. Qatar witnessed a rapid transformation in the last 15 years, with a
massive investment in infrastructure as part of its long term strategy. While the concentration
of activity in construction is not conducive to productivity gains, the magnitude of
productivity losses hints at inefficiencies in spending. The improvement of the public finance
management framework should be pursued as sizeable investment projects are planned in the
medium term.
12.
Qatar’s strategy will require a change of paradigm in the migrant labor market.
Qatar’s vision is to complete its infrastructure and subsequently move into high value added
sectors, which in turn require highly skilled workers. While Qatar relied on temporary and
low skilled migrant labor to build its infrastructure, it faces the challenge of attracting,
training and retaining talents in a context of heightened competition for migrant workers
while creating job opportunities in new sectors. Continued progress with the reform of
education sector, training, and improving the business environment are key to raising
productivity.
13.
Building the adequate institutional framework and identifying policies to
encourage innovation should be pursued. Qatari citizens are highly concentrated in the
public sector. Qatar should therefore encourage entrepreneurs to enter new industries and
spur innovation through an enabling environment.

ANNEX II. QATAR: RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
(As of November 22, 2010)
Strategic Cooperation Program (SCP)
The program of cooperation with Qatar is relatively recent and is based on ad hoc requests
from the government for advisory services addressing strategic development issues. The first
formal technical cooperation agreement was signed in April 2003 for a Public Transport
Sector Reform study. A manpower planning exercise launched in 2003 with the support of
the World Bank evolved in 2004 into a Labor Market Strategy for Qatar. The study was
completed in June 2005 and could serve as a model for the GCC countries with similar labor
issues. The project made a significant impact in Qatar and was widely publicized by the
government. In 2007, WBI conducted a study on the Knowledge Economy (KE)
development in Qatar, the results of which were discussed at several high-level workshops.
During 2008 and the first half of 2009, the Bank continued to support the implementation of
the strategy; recently, the government decided to take over further implementation of this
program but expected the Bank to continue its support in certain areas of the KE
development. In February 2010, Government, represented by the Minister of Economy and
Finance, signed the Framework Agreement for Advisory Services with the Bank.
Moving forward, the government expressed a strong interest in further collaboration with the
World Bank on a number of strategic issues, i.e., public-private partnerships, fiscal
management, and macroeconomic modeling (RMSM-X). A new program has been initiated
by the Ministry of Business and Trade to address the issues of improving business
environment.
Ongoing Projects


Business and Trade Development

The project objective is to develop specific policy measures and interventions for trade
facilitation and export development to support high quality investments in Qatar. It aims to
identify opportunities to (i) expand the range of markets into which existing export products
are sold; (ii) upgrade the quality and value added of existing export products and (iii) expand
exports of services.


PPP Development

The Ministry of Business and Trade (MBT) has developed a partnership between its PPP
department and the World Bank. The objectives of the recently established partnership are to
strengthen the capacity of the PPP department and develop a world-class PPP framework in
Qatar. The program starts with the diagnostic report and moves on to the action plan design
and implementation support.

54



Macro Capacity Development

GSDP requested the Bank’s urgent assistance with developing macroeconomic capacity, in
particular, using RMSM-X modeling. The Bank retained a macroeconomist who developed
the flow-of-funds model and trained several GSDP staff. Follow-up is currently under
discussion.
Completed Projects
 Linking Qatar’s Medium-Term Development Strategy to the Annual Budget (FY10)
 Economic Diversification Forum (FY10)
 Support to Labor Market Strategy Action Plan: Implementation (FY09)
 Knowledge Economy Strategy and Implementation Assistance (FY09)
 Workshop on ―Partnering for Value, Innovation and Job Creation: PPPs in the GCC‖

ANNEX III. QATAR: STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of November 2010)
I. ASSESSMENT OF DATA ADEQUACY FOR SURVEILLANCE
General: Economic data are broadly adequate for surveillance but there is substantial scope
for improving their frequency, timeliness and coverage. The most affected areas are the real
gross domestic product (GDP), financial accounts of the balance of payment, and external
debt statistics.
National Accounts: Despite recent improvements, key aggregates are limited to quarterly
estimates of GDP at current prices. The accuracy of data in the nonhydrocarbon sector is
undermined by the lack of comprehensive source data. In 2010, Qatar Statistics Authority
published annual series of real GDP data beginning 2004.
Price statistics: There have been some improvements in the compilation of the consumer
price index (CPI). The authorities are now publishing monthly CPI data based on a
reweighted and rebased (2007=100) basket, but the index remains deficient. The information
related to domestic rentswhich form a sizeable share of the basketreflects only new
contracts, leading to an overestimation of the current deflation.
Government finance statistics: The authorities presented to the mission, Government
budget and outcomes data according to Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM)
guidelines. However, budget data should be rendered consistent with the data on public
sector in the monetary survey and the balance of payments. Data on financing items in the
budget are not up to date. Access to this information along with data on the budget outcome
for previous fiscal years would enhance the basis for analysis.
Monetary statistics: Monetary data for Qatar Central Bank (QCB) and commercial banks
are generally timely and of high quality. The QCB reports monetary data regularly to IMF
Statistics Department (STA) for publication in International Financial Statistics (IFS) on a
monthly basis with a lag of about three weeks. Monthly and quarterly data are also published
in the Quarterly Statistics Bulletin.
Financial Stability: QCB published and disseminated its first Financial Stability Report in
2010, and plans to make it an ongoing process.
Balance of Payments: The International Transactions Reporting System (ITRS) has not yet
stabilized. The recent TA mission observed that there was a general misunderstanding of the
concepts and classifications needed to reliably use the ITRS as a main data source for the
BOP compilation. The mission recommended that a study be carried out on the feasibility of
improving the ITRS system to make it more robust and reliable. This would involve IT
resources, training of commercial bank staff, and increased resources from commercial
banks. There are significant data gaps in all components of the financial account. There is no
compilation for inward or outward direct investment, there are no portfolio investment data

56
compiled for the nonbank sector, and errors and omissions remain large. Moreover, official
statistics seem to underestimate total imports. Source data for government external assets are
not provided to the QCB for BOP compilation. Although an estimate for flows of
government external assets based on the budget data is included in the balance of payments,
no information is provided on the government’s stock of external assets, which makes it
difficult to appraise the level of investment income with any degree of confidence. The
TA mission found that there is potential for new data sources (such as the Qatar Investment
Authority, Qatar Statistics Authority, Qatar Financial Center, and Qatar Exchange) to provide
data regularly to the QCB. Although the QCB does not currently compile international
investment position (IIP) statistics, most new data sources are designed to also provide the
data required for the development of an IIP statement. The mission recommended that QCB
staff rigorously follow-up with the agencies that have agreed to provide the information to
fill important data gaps. The authorities have worked with STA in an attempt to report their
BOP data in Balance of Payments Manual 5/e (BPM5) format, however there has been
insufficient detailed information available to complete this process.
External debt
Detailed data on the country’s medium- and long-term external debt are provided to missions
during the Article IV consultation discussions. In the recent period, Qatar has issued several
international bonds. It is, therefore, important to improve the information flow on external
debt and its maturity profile. The Ministry of Economy and Finance is giving priority to the
collation and dissemination of complete data on external debt (including government,
government enterprises, and non-government corporates).
II. DATA STANDARDS AND QUALITY
Qatar is a General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) participant since December 2005.
The GDDS mission of April 2007 updated the GDDS Summary Table II Data Coverage,
Periodicity, and Timeliness; assessed dissemination practices relative to the requirements of
the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) for coverage, periodicity, and timeliness;
and identified major milestones that Qatar would have to reach to graduate from the GDDS
to the SDDS. To enhance data dissemination practices, staff assisted the authorities in
developing a National Summary Data Page (NSDP) and an Advance Release Calendar
(ARC).

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
February 16, 2011
1.
This statement provides information on recent developments in Qatar that has become
available since the staff report was circulated to the Executive Board on January 21, 2011.
The new information does not change the thrust of staff appraisal.
2.
Official data released by the authorities show that average headline CPI inflation
was -2.5 percent in 2010. In January 2011, the authorities increased local fuel prices on
average by 25 percent. Staff estimates that the effect of this measure on inflation will be
about 0.9 percent.
3.
Bank credit to the private sector rose by 10.6 percent in 2010, while broad money
increased by 23 percent. Qatar Central Bank issued 3-year government bonds (Islamic and
conventional) for a face value of $13.7 billion to local banks at 5.0 percent coupon rate to
absorb excess liquidity.
4.
The authorities announced that the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) plans to infuse
10 percent equity in local banks during the first quarter of 2011, to complete the third tranche
of the decision taken during the global crisis of 2008 to increase the capital of local banks by
20 percent.
5.
There have not been any significant spillovers from financial markets re-pricing of
political and sovereign risks in the region to Qatar. Since January 10, sovereign spreads have
widened by 10 basis points (from 86 bps to 96 bps) and Qatar Exchange lost less than
1 percent of its value.

Public Information Notice (PIN) No. 11/32
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2010 Article IV Consultation with Qatar
On February 16, 2011, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Qatar. 1
Background
Qatar has weathered the global financial crisis exceptionally well, reflecting the quick and strong
policy response by the authorities. The sizeable enhancement of liquefied natural gas (LNG)
capacity, large government support to the banking system, and increase in public spending
helped sustain high growth rates through the global crisis. Real gross domestic product (GDP)
growth has rebounded to 16 percent in 2010 and is projected to accelerate to 20 percent in
2011. Headline consumer price inflation is negative in 2010, reflecting a sharp fall in domestic
rents, although non-rent prices have started to rise. While bank credit for consumption and real
estate stagnated after 2009, credit to public sector companies increased sharply.
The banking system is well capitalized and profitable. Banks had a high capital adequacy ratio
of 17.4 percent, low nonperforming loans ratio of 1.9 percent, and a comfortable provisioning
coverage of 85 percent at end August 2010. Profitability was 20 percent higher in the first three
quarters of 2010, compared to the same period of 2009.
Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.
1

60
Continued government investment will keep growth high beyond 2011. While the self-imposed
moratorium on increasing gas production after 2012 will lead to a sharp tapering off of growth in
the hydrocarbon sector, government investments will support an average growth of 9 percent in
the nonhydrocarbon sectors during 2012–15.
Headline consumer price inflation is projected at 4 percent over the medium term, as rents
stabilize due to a gradual narrowing of the current excess capacity in real estate. Non-rent
inflation, however, could resurge as the recovery in international commodity prices affecting
Qatar’s import basket and growth in domestic demand continue. The fiscal and external
balances are projected to remain in surplus through 2015.
The economic outlook remains positive, with the main downside risk being a sharp decline in
hydrocarbon prices.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for the prudent policies during the global
economic crisis which, coupled with an increase in gas production, have contributed to
maintaining strong economic growth while safeguarding financial stability. Directors considered
that the economic outlook is favorable, despite vulnerabilities to gyrations in hydrocarbon prices
and global financial shocks. They stressed the need, however, to carefully monitor aggregate
demand to prevent the resurgence of inflationary pressures. In the medium term, increasing
productivity in the nonhydrocarbon sector will be key to promoting economic diversification.
Directors agreed that the current expansionary fiscal stance is broadly appropriate in view of the
infrastructure investment needs and the comfortable fiscal position, but recommended the
authorities stand ready to adjust policies if demand pressures reemerge. Directors encouraged
the authorities to continue saving their hydrocarbon surpluses over the medium term to facilitate
intergenerational equity. They stressed that containing current expenditures and broadening the
tax base will be critical to reducing the budget’s dependence on hydrocarbon revenues.
Directors underlined the importance of strengthening fiscal institutions to support these goals
and welcomed the authorities’ intention to establish a macrofiscal unit and a debt office.
Directors considered that the main challenge for the central bank will be to manage the credit
cycle without fuelling inflation. Given the pegged exchange rate, they recommended the central
bank rely on macroprudential instruments to help contain credit growth and potential surges in
capital inflows. Directors noted the staff’s assessment that the Qatari riyal is in line with
fundamentals and agreed that the peg to the U.S. dollar remains appropriate. They encouraged
the authorities to develop their technical and operational capacity in the event of a switch to an
alternative exchange rate regime in the context of the monetary union.

61
Directors stressed that safeguarding financial stability remains essential. They welcomed the
creation of the Financial Stability Unit and the results of the recent stress tests, which show the
banking system’s resilience to market and credit risks. Directors also supported the authorities’
plans for establishing a single financial regulator to ensure harmonization of regulation and
close regulatory gaps.
Directors noted that achieving strong and sustainable growth in the nonhydrocarbon sectors
requires further efforts on structural reforms. They underscored that modernizing and
strengthening the financial sector, including by further developing the local debt market, will be
vital for supporting private sector diversification efforts. They also stressed the importance of
improving the efficiency of public spending, more effective reforms in education and training,
and greater encouragement to innovation for increasing Qatar’s competitiveness and
productivity.
Directors acknowledged the efforts by the authorities to improve statistics, and noted that there
is scope for improving the frequency, timeliness, and coverage of economic data. They
underlined the need for greater coordination among data providers and welcomed the
authorities’ intention to seek technical assistance in the compilation of the consumer price
index.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The staff report (use the free Adobe Acrobat

Statement by Shakour Shaalan, Executive Director for Qatar
February 16, 2011
1.
On behalf of the Qatari authorities, I thank staff for their engagement and the
constructive Article IV Consultation discussions. The authorities highly value the views of
the Fund on Qatar’s economic and financial policies.
2.
Qatar has weathered the global economic and financial crisis remarkably well, on
account of strong fundamentals as well as a timely policy response. Prudent policies that
have been followed in past years, coupled with a considerable increase in gas production,
have enabled the authorities to sustain large public investments in social and physical
infrastructure and to provide timely support to the banking sector. These actions have helped
maintain high growth rates throughout the crisis as well as strong fiscal and external
accounts. Headline inflation was negative in 2010, reflecting a sharp decline in domestic
rents, although non-rent inflation has started to rise. The Qatari banking system remained
sound, well-capitalized and profitable. In the period ahead, the authorities remain committed
to policies aimed at sustaining growth and diversifying the economy, while maintaining
macroeconomic and financial stability. They acknowledge that improving productivity would
be key to sustaining long-term growth in the non-hydrocarbon sector.
Fiscal Policies and Reforms
3.
Countercyclical fiscal policy, supported by sustained growth in hydrocarbon-related
revenues, has provided a strong response to the global crisis. The authorities implemented an
adequate fiscal stimulus package in 2009 aimed at developing social and physical
infrastructure. The 2010/11 budget includes a significant increase in development
expenditure, while containing current spending. The social and infrastructure spending effort
will be pursued in the medium term, within a $100 billion investment program to be
implemented over a five-year period.
4.
Looking ahead, the authorities attach great importance to ensuring long-term fiscal
sustainability. To achieve this objective, they will continue to save a share of the
hydrocarbon revenues through their sovereign wealth fund, to facilitate intergenerational
equity. Moreover, the authorities remain committed to reducing their dependence on the
hydrocarbon sector, particularly in view of the self-imposed moratorium on developing new
hydrocarbon projects until 2015. In this connection, several measures have been carried out
to expand the non-oil revenue base, including rationalizing and broadening the corporate tax
base. Introducing a value-added tax in the context of a GCC-wide initiative would broaden
the tax base further. Current expenditure would be contained over the medium term by
enhancing spending efficiencies, resisting increases in salaries, and shrinking the size of

64
government to the extent possible. Over the medium term, these measures would result in a
substantial reduction in the non-oil primary deficit compared to past years and to the
sustainable level as calculated by staff. The authorities’ objective is to fully finance their
budgets after 2020 from non-hydrocarbon revenues.
5.
Notwithstanding the large fiscal surpluses, the government has issued a number of
conventional and Islamic bonds in 2009–10. The objective is to create a sovereign
benchmark yield curve aimed at facilitating issuances by government-owned corporates and
commercial banks. These measures would contribute to the development of a domestic bond
market. The authorities see merit in developing an institutional framework for debt
management and have expressed interest in Fund technical assistance (TA) to that effect.
Monetary, Exchange Rate, and Financial Sector Policies
6.
In view of the interest rate differentials against the U.S. dollar and other GCC
currencies, negative headline inflation, and the slowdown in bank credit to the private sector,
Qatar Central Bank (QCB) reduced its policy rate by 50 basis points last August, and would
react to the evolving economic conditions as warranted. QCB is closely monitoring liquidity
in the financial system. It stands ready to use the instruments at its disposal, including
certificates of deposits and prudential regulation―namely limits on credit ratios and sectoral
exposures―to manage credit growth and potential surges in capital inflows. QCB shares
staff’s assessment that the establishment and operation of a credit bureau would help increase
transparency, promote information among banks, and help reduce investor risk aversion.
7.
The authorities are closely monitoring aggregate demand to avoid the re-emergence
of inflationary pressures, though inflation is not a concern in the near term. It is well to recall
that the high inflation levels experienced before the global crisis were mainly due to supply
bottlenecks and rising rents. The current situation of excess supply in real estate and the
considerable easing of supply bottlenecks in raw materials—a result of increased investments
in these sectors—have greatly reduced inflation risks in the short term.
8.
The authorities reaffirm their commitment to the U.S. dollar peg, which has provided
an effective nominal anchor. Nonetheless, they are strengthening the institutional and
operational capacity in financial markets, which would prove useful in case an alternative
exchange rate system becomes desirable in the context of the GCC monetary union.
9.
The authorities remain vigilant to financial sector developments. They supported the
banking system in 2009 and 2010, respectively, through two rounds of capitalization, and
purchase of local equity and real estate assets from banks. They agree with staff that the
lessons learnt from the crisis underscore the importance of building banks’ capacity to assess

65
risks, greater information sharing among them, and improving corporate governance and
transparency. QCB is conducting regular stress testing of banks, which point to the system’s
resilience to credit and market risks; a result similar to that reached by staff. The QCB also
published its first Financial Stability Review. The authorities are committed to establishing a
single financial regulatory authority to address regulatory and supervisory gaps and
strengthen financial sector reforms. They aim to align their supervisory and regulatory
frameworks with best standards and practices, and plan to implement Basel III proposals
shortly.
Statistical Issues
10.
Considerable progress has been made in improving the quality and dissemination of
economic data. Nonetheless, shortcomings remain in the national accounts and inflation
statistics, and the authorities have requested Fund TA in compiling the consumer price index.
Recent TA on the financial account of the balance of payments pointed to lack of capacity in
the compilation of the international investment position statistics. The authorities are
preparing a roadmap for the implementation of the recommendations of the TA mission.
