This report is based on discussions held in Prague during November 13-24, 2008.
The mission team comprised Mr. Subhash Thakur (head), Ms. Sònia Muñoz (EUR),
Ms. Li Lian Ong (MCM), and Ms. Anita Tuladhar (FAD). Messrs. Willy Kiekens
(Executive Director) and Stanislav Polak (Senior Advisor to the Executive Director)
also joined the discussions. The mission met with Minister of Finance Miroslav
Kalousek, Czech National Bank Governor Zdeněk Tůma, other senior officials, as well
as representatives of the Parliament, financial and business sectors, academia, and the
media.
Political Background: A three-party center-right coalition, ruling since January 2007
with a very thin majority, faces elections in 2010. The Czech Republic assumes the
rotating EU Presidency from France in January 2009.
Exchange Rate Regime: The exchange regime is classified as an independent float
(Informational Annex). The Czech Republic has accepted the obligations of Article
VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on the
making of payments and transfers for current international transactions.

STAFF APPRAISAL AND SUMMARY
1.
Following three years of rapid growth, the economy is set to slow sharply in 2009.
Growth is projected at 1½ percent, a far cry from the average growth of 6 percent recorded
during 2005-2007. Even then, risks remain on the downside, stemming primarily from tighter
credit conditions that could hold back domestic spending, and a deeper recession in the
eurozone than now expected.
2.
With inflation likely to fall below the Czech National Bank’s (CNB) target of
3 percent, scope exists for further monetary easing. Falling commodity prices and
weakening demand are projected to help bring inflation down to 2½ percent in 2009. Recent
cuts in the policy rate are appropriate. It will be important that the CNB communication
strategy ensures that expectations are well anchored to the new target of 2 percent from
January 2010.
3.
Export competitiveness is adequate and the external position has remained
strong. The modest current account deficit is expected to be comfortably financed by direct
investment inflows. In the staff’s view, the koruna is broadly in line with fundamentals and
consistent with external stability.
4.
The financial sector has come under increasing pressure. Liquidity has tightened
considerably in interbank markets, and trading in the government bond market froze
temporarily in October. The country’s large presence of foreign banks with significant
exposure to emerging Europe has also given rise to uncertainty about the risk of cutbacks in
lending. Meanwhile, credit risk, especially in the corporate sector, has risen significantly amid
the worsening outlook for economic activity.
5.
The authorities have moved to maintain confidence and ensure financial stability.
Measures to improve liquidity have been implemented. Further steps could be taken to support
the smooth functioning of markets, such as widening the range of instruments acceptable as
collateral in the interbank market, and taking measures to mitigate perceptions of rising
counterparty risks and promote greater transparency in the government bond market. Financial
supervisors also need to remain vigilant and ensure that their toolkit is sufficient to address
any emerging weakness. Strengthening financial safety nets and crisis preparedness is crucial,
including proactive collaboration with financial authorities and governments in home
countries of foreign subsidiaries.
6.
Fiscal policy should aim at supporting growth, but be cognizant of potential
financing constraints and medium-term fiscal goals. Recent strengthening of the fiscal
position and the authorities’ commitment to the nominal expenditure ceilings have created
room for countercyclical policy in the turbulent times ahead. For 2009, automatic stabilizers
should be allowed to operate fully. This would imply a deficit of about 2½ percent of GDP,

4
higher than currently budgeted (1.6 percent of GDP). With low government debt and limited
macroeconomic imbalances, there would be room for a discretionary fiscal stimulus under a
more adverse scenario. Stimulus measures need to be temporary and well targeted. Faster
implementation of EU-funded projects could help boost demand while safeguarding the longrun fiscal position.
7.
Over the medium term, the momentum of reforms will need to be restored to
address long-term challenges and raise potential growth. Fiscal space will need to be
created to cope with the demographic transition through greater efficiency in public spending.
Recent health and parametric pension reforms should help reduce fiscal pressures and increase
labor force participation. Scope exists for improving incentives to work through reforms of the
labor market and the tax-benefit system. The beneficial effects of such structural reforms
should reinforce each other, promoting economic stability and sustained growth.
I. INTRODUCTION
8.
Generally strong fundamentals have helped the Czech economy weather the
global financial crisis until late 2008. Robust productivity growth, improved fiscal
performance, and a comfortable external position supported by inflows of foreign direct
investment placed the economy in a relatively favorable position. Reflecting these strengths,
the adverse effects on activity and risks in the banking system remained contained, as
compared with the regional peers (Figure 1 and Table 1).
9.
Nonetheless, the economy has begun to be buffeted by strong spillover effects
from the global crisis. The financial sector has come under increasing pressure, given its
rapid integration with the rest of Europe and the very high level of foreign ownership of
banking assets (97 percent). The prospect of a sharp slowdown in economic growth in 2009
is also weighing on the outlook for the financial sector. The speed and enormity of the global
financial market turmoil and the depth of the downturn pose a challenge for policy-making to
preserve financial stability and mitigate the risk of a hard landing.

II. THE SETTING
10.
Following three years of exceptionally rapid expansion, a downturn is under
way. The slowdown in growth in 2008 to 4 percent of GDP has been led by domestic
demand, and especially private consumption, as high oil and food prices and an increase in
the value added tax dented growth in household real disposable incomes. A tight labor
market and falling export profit margins due to a strong koruna held back fixed investment.
The gathering recession in the advanced economies has started to slow growth in the last
quarter of 2008, reflecting the economy’s high trade openness. Forward-looking indicators
of domestic demand suggest that the downturn is continuing to deepen. While the output
gap remains positive, capacity constraints have eased.

Inflation has started to recede rapidly,
after having risen sharply since late 2007.
Headline inflation accelerated to above 6 percent,
well above the central bank’s target of 3 percent,
fuelled by oil and food price increases, higher
indirect taxes and demand pressures. Regulated
prices and indirect taxes accounted for more than
60 percent of the rise in inflation. Underlying
inflation also rose in the first half of the year,
despite the dampening effect of the strong koruna,
reflecting the tight labor market and strong credit
growth. Since September, inflation started to
decline following the fall on global commodity
prices.

12.
Receding inflation pressures in recent months created room for monetary
easing. The koruna, up 12 percent through July, helped keep monetary conditions tight,
partially offsetting the impact of negative real interest rates. After raising its policy rate
throughout 2007 and in February 2008 by a total of 125 basis points to 3¾ percent, the CNB
cut it by 25 basis points in August—the first central bank in Europe to reverse the tightening
cycle—citing concerns that the excessively strong koruna could hamper economic activity.
As the ripple effects of the global financial crisis began to impact the economy, the CNB
acted aggressively, cutting the policy rate in early November by 75 basis points, exceeding
market expectations. A further 50 basis point cut in mid-December brought the policy rate to
2¼ percent.

Czech financial markets and institutions have come under increasing pressure,
as the global financial turmoil spilled into local markets:

appear to be insignificant. However, off-balance
sheet liabilities appear to be high relative to onbalance sheet assets.1
• The interbank market has tightened considerably. Counterparty risk is perceived to
have risen, as evidenced by the rising PRIBOR and the widening spreads in its term structure.

1

Off-balance sheet liabilities include derivatives transactions (more than 80 percent of the total and equivalent
to 3 times on-balance sheet assets) and assets under custody (10 percent of the total); contingent liabilities in the
form of commitments, guarantees and pledges given are equivalent to one-fifth of on-balance sheet assets.

9
Banks holding surplus koruna liquidity are reluctant to lend beyond the overnight market.
The CNB’s aggressive cut in the policy rate in early November was aimed, in part, at easing
conditions in the interbank market. Activity in the foreign exchange swap market has also
reportedly declined amid tightening conditions, although foreign exchange liquidity has not
been an issue.

The external position remains strong, despite the sharp real appreciation. The
current account deficit narrowed further to 1.8 percent of GDP in 2007, reflecting continued
solid export growth. Although it widened to 2.3 percent of GDP in the third quarter of 2008
due to declining exports and a large dividend outflow, it remained comfortably financed by
direct investment inflows. At 43 percent of GDP at end-2007, external debt remained low,
although short-term debt rose to $23 billion. International reserves rose modestly to
$34 billions, covering about 3 months of imports.

With the five largest companies accounting for almost 90 percent of market capitalization at end-2007, the
Czech market is the most highly concentrated in emerging Europe.

Risks to the baseline projection are clearly tilted to the downside. The downward
phase of the cycle has coincided with a possible credit crunch that could hold back spending
by corporations and households, and a deeper-than-projected recession in the eurozone. The
main risks center on weaker than projected global growth and financial market uncertainty
across the eurozone. As a result, foreign direct investment, an important driver of recent

growth, could suffer. Bank profitability, largely
driven by consumer and mortgage lending, could
also worsen in light of the weakening economic
outlook, further depressing prospects for growth. In
a more adverse scenario, a prolonged credit
squeeze could result in an even deeper downturn
than in the baseline (Box 2 and 3).

III. THE MAIN POLICY CHALLENGES
18.
The consultation centered on how policies could be calibrated to ensure
financial stability and facilitate a smooth landing. Against the backdrop of a deepening
European downturn and a banking system overwhelmingly under foreign ownership, the
discussions focused on a) the macrofinancial and regulatory implications of the financial
crisis and b) the policy options for preserving macroeconomic stability by ensuring a soft
landing and keeping inflation on a downward path.
A. Rising Risks to the Financial Sector

• Liquidity risk is rising. Banking system liquidity has been declining gradually as a result
of the rapid growth in bank lending. Liquidity risk at the smaller banks has increased
markedly, given their reliance on their foreign parents—which have reportedly set liquidity
limits for their foreign operations—and the interbank market. In this context, foreign bank

14
ownership has come under closer scrutiny, as any sharp retrenchment of funds could have a
significantly negative impact on financial intermediation and economic activity (Box 2).6
Although officials noted that there has been little evidence so far of any significant
repatriation of funds to foreign parents, staff expect some shrinking of subsidiaries’ balance
sheets. Meanwhile, more volatile short-term lending, which the authorities attribute to parent
lending to branches, is rising as a proportion of total loans to banks.
Box 2. Foreign Banks in the Czech Republic: Rewards and Risks
The Czech Republic represents one of the most important host countries in emerging Europe,
accounting for 11 percent of total foreign claims on the emerging European region as of end-2007.
The presence of foreign banks has typically been considered a positive development in emerging market
countries, as they drive financial innovation and improve operational efficiency. Additionally, strong
ownership brand is seen to provide banks with a second line of defense—after own financial strength—
against potential shocks.
However, as the current credit crisis
demonstrates, even the major international banks
could be exposed to the risk of mispricing and a
sudden reversal in the credit cycle. Thus, the
vulnerability of the Czech banking system to any
deleveraging by foreign parents may have increased.
Claims by foreign banks on the non-bank private
sector amounted to about 56 percent of Czech GDP at
the end of 2007, of which one-third is attributable to
more volatile short-term claims.1

not had to rely on parent financing for their lending
activities, thus reducing the rollover risk and limiting indirect credit risk from any depreciation in the
koruna. Koruna liquidity remains high, although liquidity risk at smaller banks has nudged upwards in
recent months.

• Credit risk, especially to the corporate sector, has increased significantly. Credit quality
is generally considered the biggest risk to the outlook for the banking sector. The rapid rise in
property prices and housing construction have increased the possibility that a reversal in the
property market would affect the credit risk of both households and corporates, especially

since the real estate sector is the main driver of corporate credit growth. The worsening
outlook for the corporate sector is weighing heavily on small and medium enterprises due to
the likely trickle-down effects of a sharp slowdown in activity by large companies. Moreover,
given the strong competition among lenders, loans may not have been adequately priced to
cover credit risks which have yet to be tested through a full economic cycle.

21.
The authorities concurred that prompt measures needed to be taken to maintain
confidence in the financial system and to ensure its stability. In addition to steps already
taken by the CNB to ease the tightness in money and bond markets, staff suggested further
measures, viz.: (i) widening the range of instruments acceptable as collateral in the interbank
market, in addition to government bonds; if this proved insufficient, steps to mitigate
perceptions of rising counterparty risks ; (ii) ensuring greater transparency in the government
bond market by, for example, adhering strictly to the announced size of bond issuances, to
enable accurate pricing by dealers; and taking into account the need for developing the local
market when determining the types of issuances. Additional measures to improve the demand

16
for government securities consistent with staff discussions have since been implemented.
Supervisors also need to be vigilant about the extent of the contingent liabilities of the banking
system, and to ensure that banks have the capacity to cover these liabilities, should they
materialize.
22.
The toolkit of financial supervisors must be sufficiently versatile to address
weaknesses as they arise. The authorities have implemented a system to monitor the liquidity
positions of banks on a daily basis, to collect up-to-date information on the transfer of liquidity
by banks overseas and monitor the exposures of foreign subsidiaries to their parent banks. The
supervisors will also soon implement a framework for systemic assessment to help review the
potential effects of a crisis. Since any decision to intervene would likely be discretionary, a
consistent approach would need to be established among the relevant authorities from the
outset. Staff also recommended that the modalities for the application of Pillar II of Basel II be
put in place as soon as possible, to ensure that banks remain well-capitalized.
23.
Staff emphasized that, in the current uncertain environment, strengthening
financial safety nets and crisis preparedness measures was crucial. The CNB has
supervisory tools in place to preserve the continuity of access to key banking functions in
systemically important banks. These measures should be continually enhanced, and where
discretion is required, supervisory response should be prompt. Thus, the features of the
Deposit Insurance Fund should be calibrated to ensure transparency and credibility. In the
context of the pending revision of the relevant legislation, staff suggested a clarification of the
capacity and features of the scheme to help maintain confidence.7 Domestic crisis management
arrangements between the CNB and the Ministry of Finance have been established and tested.
Similar formal arrangements with the private sector could be considered. In view of the
importance of cross-border bank linkages for the Czech Republic, a major host country to
subsidiaries of Western European banks, there was agreement that proactive collaboration with
financial authorities and governments in home countries was essential.
B. The Scope for Monetary Easing
24.
The monetary policy stance shifted in mid-year in view of the changing balance
of risks between inflation and growth. CNB officials explained that in the first half of
2008, inflation risks were viewed as serious, especially in the context of possible secondround effects of food and energy prices and a tight labor market. Falling commodity prices
and weakening demand led to a reversal of the tightening cycle. Recent signs of weakness in
the labor market have begun to allay concerns about wage inflation.

With inflation likely to fall below the CNB’s target of 3 percent amid a sharp
slowdown, scope exists for further easing. Under the baseline, staff as well as the CNB
expect inflation to drop below the target of 3 percent in 2009, driven by weaker domestic
demand, the lagged impact of the currency appreciation, and falling commodity prices. The
pace and the magnitude of the easing would have to take into account movements in the
koruna and the extent of weakness in demand (Box 3). The latter could be worse than the
baseline, if a credit crunch were to materialize (Box 2). While CNB officials regarded the
chances of a credit crunch as low, they and the staff were in agreement on the risks and the
options for monetary policy. As for the risk of deflation, CNB officials considered a short
period of falling prices possible under an adverse scenario, but not likely to pose a
substantive policy challenge.

18

Box 3. Challenges Facing Monetary Policy
The pace and the magnitude of the monetary policy response to the global shocks will be shaped by
important uncertainties: the extent of the slowdown of the world economy (and especially Germany)
and the volatility of the koruna. Staff simulations, based on the IMF’s Global Integrated Monetary and
Fiscal model, suggest—assuming that the lower inflation target from 2010 is fully credible—that a
substantial cut in the policy rate may be needed.
The sharp slowdown is likely to lead to rapid
disinflation, dampening any inflationary impact
of lower interest rates. A strong adverse shock to
the euro area, hitting Czech exports, would require
an additional cut in the policy rate, depending on
the behavior of the exchange rate. If monetaryrelevant inflation is initially elevated owing to the
past global supply shocks and tight labor markets,
the shock could result in rapid disinflation and a
fall in growth by 2-3 percentage points.
The path of the koruna, a key disinflationary
influence for the past two years, would remain
important. The appreciation played a key role in
keeping inflation under check during the surge in
commodities prices and the increase in the VAT.
Simulation results suggest that the response to
exchange rate shocks are likely to be swamped by
the impact of the slowdown in activity.

The effectiveness of the traditional channels of monetary policy transmission has
become more uncertain. Accordingly, CNB officials were aware of the need to act with
particular agility. Staff stressed that communication strategy should ensure that expectations
were well anchored to the new inflation target of 2 percent from January 2010.8 In this context,
officials noted that the recent decision to publish a forecast exchange-rate path beginning in
2009 was a technical fine-tuning of the inflation targeting framework and should not be
interpreted as giving greater weight to the exchange rate.

Monetary and Fiscal Analysis,” IMF Working Paper 08/72.

19
C. Maintaining Competitiveness
27.
Competitiveness is adequate but under incipient pressure. Export volumes
enjoyed double-digit growth for the greater part of the year, with market shares continuing to
expand. Staff and the authorities shared the assessment that the koruna was broadly in line
with fundamentals, a view supported by estimates based on the CGER methodology (Box 4),
despite some recent erosion of competitiveness due to the lagged effects of the earlier
appreciation and rising unit labor costs. The authorities had expressed concerns about the
damaging effects on activity of an excessively strong koruna, although these have been
assuaged to some extent by the recent reversal of the appreciation. Looking ahead, the
planned privatization of the remaining state-owned assets, estimated at about 1.9 percent of
GDP, and the expected large inflows of EU funds in coming years could put upward pressure
on the koruna. In this context, the CNB has renewed its 2002 agreement with the government
to limit any appreciation in the event of large privatization revenues or inflows of EU fund.
CNB officials acknowledged that this policy was likely to pose challenges for reserve
management, especially in view of the sizeable losses already incurred by the CNB.9
28.
Although euro adoption remains an important policy objective, no target date
for entry has been set. The authorities continue to strive to meet the Maastricht criteria for
euro entry in a sustainable manner. The CNB’s decision to reduce the inflation target to
2 percent from 2010 will align it with the ECB’s inflation target.
D. Supporting Growth and Preserving Fiscal Sustainability
29.
The immediate challenge for fiscal policy is to support growth while protecting
the hard-won gains from recent fiscal consolidation. In the face of stronger-thanexpected fiscal outturns in recent years of rapid growth, the authorities have sought to lower
deficit targets while adhering to the nominal expenditure ceilings, thereby affirming their
commitment to the medium-term objective of a deficit of 1 percent of GDP by 2012. As the
growth outlook worsens, these early savings have helped create room for automatic
stabilizers to operate and allowed for a cyclical margin to stay within the SGP limit of
3 percent of GDP. These savings have also helped support the government’s liquidity
position, relieving near-term financing pressures in a tight financial market. However,
officials felt that the rising pressure for stimulus is testing fiscal discipline and could put at
risk the achievements of earlier reforms.

Accumulated losses were 26 percent of total assets at end-2007.

20
Box 4. Exchange Rate Assessment
Staff analysis suggests that the koruna is broadly in line with fundamentals and consistent with
external stability. The real exchange rate, adjusted for either relative consumer prices or unit labor
costs, appreciated by around 10 percent

amount.
The balance of payments is consistent with external stability. The gap between the actual and the
underlying current account is not considered significant, suggesting that the rise in the deficit reflects
cyclical and transitory factors. Moreover, the underlying current account is broadly in line with its
equilibrium level.

With the rapid worsening of the near-term outlook, the fiscal deficit in 2009 is
likely be higher than budgeted. In October, the authorities’ projected a deficit of
1.6 percent of GDP, assuming growth of 3.7 percent, which implied a neutral fiscal stance.
Cuts in the corporate income tax and social security contribution rates are largely offset by
the tightening of the wage bill and social transfers under the 2007 fiscal reform package.
Staff agreed that a neutral stance struck an appropriate balance between the goal of
supporting growth and the countervailing pressures of financing risks (Paragraph 13, bullet
2). With the growth assumption in the budget looking increasingly unrealistic, automatic
stabilizers will need to be allowed to operate. In staff’s view, this would be consistent with a
higher deficit of around of 2½ percent of GDP, mainly reflecting lower revenue collections.

21
31.
The authorities believed that fiscal policy, while trying to support growth,
needed to be mindful of potential financing constraints and medium-term fiscal goals.
If the outlook for growth were to worsen even further, they would be prepared to consider a
discretionary stimulus package, given low public debt and limited macroeconomic
imbalances. However, the recent freezing of the government bond market that led to
cancellation of bond issuances underscored potential financing risks. Staff welcomed the
authorities’ readiness to shift to a more expansionary fiscal stance as needed. It also
suggested measures which would boost demand while safeguarding medium-term deficit
objectives such as more rapid implementation of EU-funded projects and temporary
measures that are well targeted to vulnerable groups. Permanent tax cuts, however, should
be avoided, especially given the low tax-wedge already in place following the tax reform
plan approved in 2007.
32.
Over the medium term, the authorities plan important structural reforms to
ensure fiscal sustainability.10 Following the introduction of user fees in the health care
sector, a voluntary supplementary health insurance system is being proposed. Reform of tax
administration by integrating it with customs and social contribution systems is being
planned, for which a comprehensive modernization program is needed. Regulatory reforms
in private pensions are being implemented while a voluntary partial opt-out to funded
pension is being considered. The authorities noted, however, that these steps remained
politically difficult in the near term. Staff supported these efficiency-enhancing measures
and reiterated the scope for reforms in the tax-benefits system and labor market to enhance
incentives to work, generate fiscal savings and raise potential growth.11

1/ In percent of GDP.
2/ On ESA-95 basis.
3/ Changes in reserves reflect off-market conversion of large privatization receipts, EU transfers, and sales of accumulated interest. The projected
increase in reserves in 2008-12 is based on the expected increase in EU-fund transfers and the level of absorption of these transfers.

4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels

Exchange Rate Arrangement:
The currency of the Czech Republic is the Czech koruna, created on
February 8, 1993 upon the dissolution of the currency union with the
Slovak Republic, which had used the Czechoslovak koruna as its currency.
From May 3, 1993 to May 27, 1997, the exchange rate was pegged to a
basket of two currencies: the deutsche mark (65 percent) and the
U.S. dollar (35 percent). On February 28, 1996, the Czech National Bank
widened the exchange rate band from ±0.5 percent to ±7.5 percent around
the central rate. On May 27, 1997, managed floating was introduced. In the
Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions, the
de facto exchange rate regime of the Czech Republic is classified as an
independent float. Since 2002, the CNB has not engaged in direct
interventions in the foreign exchange market. International reserves have
been affected by the off-market purchases of large privatization receipts
and EU transfers and the sales of the accumulated interest. On
December 8, 2008, the exchange rate of the Czech koruna stood at
CZK 19.895 per U.S. dollar.

3
The Czech Republic has accepted the obligations of Article VIII and
maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on the making of
payments and transfers for current international transactions. The Czech
Republic maintains exchange restrictions for security reasons, based on
UN Security Council Resolutions and Council of the European Union
Regulations, that have been notified to the Fund for approval under the
procedures set forth in Executive Board Decision No. 144-(52/51).

Appendix II: Statistical Issues
Data provision is adequate for surveillance. The Czech Republic subscribed to the Special
Data Dissemination Standard in April 1998, and metadata and annual observance reports for
2006 and 2007 are posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board.
Data on core surveillance variables are available to the Fund regularly and with minimal lags
(reporting to STA is less current, especially for foreign trade and the national accounts).
Exchange rates and interest rates, set by the Czech National Bank (CNB), are reported daily
with no lag. Gross and net international reserves are reported on a monthly basis with a oneweek lag, as well as on a 10-day basis (with the CNB’s balance sheet) with a one-week lag.
Consumer prices, reserve money, broad money, borrowing and lending interest rates, central
government fiscal accounts, and foreign trade are reported monthly with a lag of between one
and four weeks. Final monetary survey data are available with a lag of about one month. GDP
and balance of payments data are made available on a quarterly basis with a lag of two to
three months. Since 2003, the main components of the balance of payments are also available
monthly. Annual data published in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook cover all
operations of the general government, including the extrabudgetary funds excluded from the
monthly data. These annual data are available on a timely basis. Monthly fiscal data
published in International Financial Statistics (IFS) cover state budget accounts and are
available with a two- to three-month lag.
While data quality is generally high, some deficiencies remain in certain areas, and the
authorities are taking measures to improve data accuracy.
•

National accounts data are subject to certain weaknesses. Value added in the
small-scale private sector is likely to be underestimated, as the mechanisms for data
collection on this sector are not yet fully developed and a significant proportion of
unrecorded activity stems from tax evasion. Discrepancies between GDP estimates
based on the production method and the expenditure method are large and are
subsumed under change in stocks. Quarterly estimates of national accounts are
derived from quarterly reports of enterprises and surveys. The estimates are subject to
bias because of nonresponse (while annual reporting of bookkeeping accounts is
mandatory for enterprises, quarterly reporting is not) and lumping of several
expenditure categories in particular quarters by respondents. Large swings in
individual components of spending and the overall GDP from quarter to quarter bring
into question the reliability of the quarterly data and hamper business cycle analysis.

•

Recently, revisions to procedures for processing export data have brought external
trade statistics close to the practice in the EU. However, a continued weakness of
foreign trade statistics is the unavailability of fixed base price indices for exports and
imports; these indices are currently presented on the basis of the same month of the
previous year.

6
•

Monetary survey data provided to the European Department are generally adequate
for policy purposes. However, large variations in the interbank clearing account float,
especially at the end of the year, require caution in interpreting monetary
developments. The CNB has made a major effort to identify the causes of these
variations and adjust the data. In 2002, to meet EU statistical conventions, the CNB
implemented the European Central Bank’s (ECB) framework for collecting,
compiling, and reporting monetary data. The data published in IFS are based on
monetary accounts derived from the ECB’s framework. The same set of accounts also
forms the basis for monetary statistics published in the CNB’s bulletins and on the
website, which are thereby effectively harmonized with the monetary statistics
published in IFS, although the presentation in IFS differs somewhat from the CNB’s.

•

Annual fiscal data on ESA-95 basis has been prepared by the Czech Statistical Office.
Quarterly data for non-financial accounts have also been compiled and quarterly
financial accounts are being prepared. The Ministry of Finance uses the ESA-95
methodology for the Convergence Program targets. The ESA-95 methodology differs
from the national (fiscal targeting methodology) in terms of the coverage of the
institutions (for example, the Czech Consolidation Agency is included in the central
government under ESA definition) and inclusion of financial transactions and other
accrual items (for example, called guarantees). The Ministry of Finance participated
in the Fund’s pilot project to transition to the statistical methodologies outlined in
Government Finance Statistics Manual, 2001.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
February 6, 2009
This statement provides information on economic developments since the staff report was
issued. The new information does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
1.
The downturn in demand and activity accelerated sharply and inflation slowed
further. Industrial production fell by 17 percent in the year to November 2008, led by a sharp
decline in the automobile sector, and retail sales dropped by over 6 percent over the same
period. Exports fell by almost 18 percent, led by vehicles and machinery, while imports
declined by 13 percent. Indicators of consumer and business confidence fell further in
January 2009. Consumer price inflation declined to 3.6 percent in the year to December 2008,
a 15-month low, driven by prices of food and fuel.
2.
Staff has lowered its projection for growth in 2009 to -1¼ percent from
1½ percent. The sharp downward revision reflects the deepening recession in the euro area,
especially Germany, as well as deteriorating prospects for domestic demand. While
investment is set to slow down markedly, especially in the key automobile sector, private
consumption is projected to weaken further, reflecting dimmer prospects for employment and
lower household confidence.
3.
The authorities have lowered their projection for growth as well. The Ministry of
Finance now forecasts growth of 1.4 percent in 2009, down from 3.7 percent. The sharp
downward revision is driven by exports of goods and services, which are expected to fall by
close to 1 percent. The Czech National Bank (CNB) is due to publish its latest assessment of
economic prospects on February 5. Based on public statements of CNB officials, market
participants expect a sharp downward revision in the forecast for growth and a further cut in
the policy interest rate.
4.
In light of the worsened outlook for growth, the authorities revised the budget
for 2009 in late January. The Ministry of Finance raised its projection for the fiscal deficit
to 3 percent of GDP from 1.6 percent of GDP (on ESA-95 basis). The higher deficit reflects
primarily lower revenues, and is to be partially financed through a drawdown of reserves.
With the deficit outturn for 2008 better than expected at around 1¼ percent of GDP due to
lower capital spending, the revised budget implies a slightly expansionary fiscal stance for
2009.
5.
The koruna continued to depreciate, in line with the trend in the regional
currencies. Against the euro, the koruna fell by 4.1 percent during January, following a
decline of 6 percent in December 2008.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2008 Article IV Consultation with the
Czech Republic
On February 6, 2009, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV Consultation with the Czech Republic. 1
Background
Generally strong fundamentals helped the Czech economy weather the global financial
crisis until late 2008. Robust productivity growth, improved fiscal performance, and a
comfortable external position, supported by inflows of foreign direct investment, placed the
economy in a relatively favorable position. Reflecting these strengths, the adverse effects
on activity and risks in the banking system remained contained, as compared with the
regional peers. Inflation started to recede rapidly, after having risen sharply in the first half
of 2008. As the ripple effects of the global financial crisis began to impact the economy, the
Czech National Bank acted aggressively, cutting the policy rate by a total of 200 basis
points.
Growth is projected to slow sharply in 2009 amid a gathering recession abroad and
tightening credit at home. The shrinking demand from the euro area, and especially
Germany, will curtail exports and direct investment inflows. Tightening credit conditions at
home and shrinking profit margins will weigh on capital spending. Household consumption
is expected to grow only modestly as plummeting confidence and rising unemployment
overshadow the favorable impact of declining inflation on disposable income. Risks to this
growth outlook are clearly tilted to the downside. The downward phase of the cycle has
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of
the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
coincided with a deeper-than-projected recession in the euro area, and tighter credit
conditions at home.
The financial sector came under increasing pressure in the latter part of 2008. Liquidity
tightened considerably in interbank markets, and trading activity in the government bond
market froze temporarily in October. Meanwhile, credit risk, especially in the corporate
sector, rose amid the worsening outlook for economic activity.
Competitiveness was adequate but under incipient pressure. Export volumes enjoyed
double-digit growth for the greater part of the year, with market shares continuing to
expand. The koruna was broadly in line with fundamentals despite some recent erosion of
competitiveness due to the lagged effects of the earlier appreciation and rising unit labor
costs.
In the face of stronger-than-expected fiscal outturns in recent years of rapid growth, the
authorities have sought to lower deficit targets while adhering to the nominal expenditure
ceilings, thereby affirming their commitment to the medium-term objective of a deficit of
1 percent of GDP by 2012. Streamlining of social spending under the 2007 fiscal reform
package and buoyancy of corporate tax revenues resulted in a fiscal outturn in 2008 of less
than half that initially budgeted. With the rapid worsening of the near-term growth outlook,
the fiscal deficit in 2009 is likely to be higher than the budgeted 1½ percent of GDP.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors praised the generally strong fundamentals that have helped the Czech
economy weather the initial spillover effects of the global financial crisis relatively well.
Directors noted, however, that the Czech economy, highly open to trade and investment
flows, has begun to be adversely affected by the global crisis. Given the prospect of a
sharp economic downturn in 2009, it will be important to preserve financial stability and
mitigate the impact of the downturn, using the flexibility gained from past sound policies. At
the same time, the authorities should remain mindful of their medium-term fiscal and
inflation objectives.
While welcoming the resilience of the Czech banking sector, Directors noted that financial
system risks have increased. They supported the authorities’ measures to maintain
confidence and ensure financial stability, and encouraged further steps to support the
smooth functioning of markets and to promote greater transparency in the government
bond market. Financial supervisors need to remain vigilant and ensure that their toolkit is
sufficient to address any emerging weakness. Directors also called for the strengthening of
financial safety nets. Although it is reassuring that the lending by the subsidiaries of foreign
banks is predominantly in local currency and is largely financed by local deposits, Directors
considered that, in view of the dominant presence of these foreign banks, proactive
collaboration with their financial authorities in home countries is warranted.
Directors supported the Czech National Bank’s recent decisions to cut the policy interest
rate. With inflation projected to fall below the target of 3 percent and a sharp slowdown in
prospect, there is scope for further prudent easing depending on movements in the koruna

3
and the extent of weakness in demand. Directors considered that the central bank’s
communication strategy should ensure that expectations are well anchored to the revised
inflation target of 2 percent, effective January 2010.
Directors viewed competitiveness to be adequate and the external position to remain
strong. They noted the staff’s assessment that the koruna exchange rate is broadly in line
with fundamentals. Concerns about the excessively strong koruna in the first half of 2008
have been eased by the recent significant reversal of the appreciation.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention of supporting economic activity in the face of a
sharper than expected downturn. They also agreed that fiscal policy needs to give due
weight to financing constraints and to preserving the hard-won gains in fiscal consolidation.
The recent strengthening of the fiscal position and the authorities’ commitment to the
nominal expenditure ceilings have created room for countercyclical policy, including the full
operation of automatic stabilizers. Directors welcomed the revised budget for 2009, which
implies a slightly expansionary stance. Should the downturn prove deeper than expected,
they saw room for some further discretionary stimulus, given the relatively low government
debt and limited macroeconomic imbalances. Any such stimulus measures, however,
should be temporary and well targeted.
Directors commended the authorities’ commitment to press ahead with essential structural
reforms over the longer term. They welcomed the ongoing reforms in pensions and health
care, which should help ensure fiscal sustainability. Looking ahead, creating fiscal space to
cope with the demographic transition through greater efficiency in public spending will be
important. Directors also reiterated the scope for reforms in the tax-benefits system and
labor markets to enhance incentives to work, generate fiscal savings, and raise potential
growth.

Statement by Willy Kiekens, Executive Director for the Czech Republic
and Stanislav Polak , Senior Advisor to Executive Director
February 6, 2009
The Czech authorities thank the staff for the useful discussions in preparation of the 2008
Article IV Consultation report.
Macroeconomic outlook
After an average growth of 6.4 percent during the period 2005–2007, growth in 2008
isestimated to have declined to around 4 percent. In 2009, the highly open Czech economy is
set to slow down further due to the deteriorating outlook in its main trading partners.
In its January outlook update, the Czech Ministry of Finance revised the October forecast for
output growth in 2009 from 3.7 percent to 1.4 percent. This is in line with the January 2009
Interim Forecast of the European Commission which anticipates growth of 1.7 percent.
However, both outlooks point to downside risks.
Macroeconomic forecasts and their risk assessments are currently fraught with unprecedented
uncertainty. Continuous revisions to the global and Euro zone economic outlook make it
difficult to assess the impact of exogenous variables on the Czech economy. Weakening
external demand will weigh on export and investment activities despite the current
depreciation of the Czech koruna. Weaker business activity will slow down employment
growth, which in turn will moderate domestic demand. The consensus forecast for 2009 has
dropped from 4.4 percent in August 2008 to 0.3 percent in the January 2009 survey.
Policy challenges
The Czech Republic has entered the current global crisis without significant macroeconomic
imbalances and with a sound financial system. Nevertheless, macroeconomic management is
facing significant challenges because of uncertainty about the economic contraction in main
trading partners. The authorities are aware that the Czech economy is heavily dependent on
exports, concentrated in a few sectors and towards a few countries. Therefore, in the short
term, domestic demand should be boosted with fiscal stimulus measures, while in the
medium to long term, structural reforms to improve the competitiveness and flexibility of the
economy will make the economy more resilient to adverse external shocks. National policy
choices of a small open economy have a limited impact on the current global conditions. In a
small open economy, demand-stimulating measures, significantly leak to external economies.
Therefore, the Czech authorities support a coordinated international approach in reversing the
current global slowdown.
On December 2, 2008, the Czech Government announced its “Strategy of Preparedness and
Growth Acceleration” to mitigate risks related to the global financial crisis. Early this year,
the National Economic Council was established to identify measures to minimize the impact
of the unfavorable external cyclical conditions, while preserving long-term objectives. A
comprehensive set of structural reforms is well-identified to improve the economy and will

2
be implemented when a broader political consensus across ruling and opposition political
parties can be reached on the detailed nature and sequence of particular reforms.
(i) Public finances and fiscal stimulus
The general government deficit has been reduced from 2.7 percent of GDP in 2006 to
1 percent in 2007. For 2008, this deficit was broadly stable at 1.2 percent, despite less
favorable economic growth, thanks to the beneficial effects of the January 2008 fiscal
measures.
The 2009 budget, adopted last October, targeted a deficit of 1.6 percent of GDP. However, as
automatic stabilizers will be allowed full play, and because of the fiscal stimulus plan, the
deficit is now expected to be at 3 percent. Assuming adherence to the spending ceilings
outlined in the medium-term budget, the deficit should be 2.9 percent of GDP in 2010 and
2.5 percent in 2011.
As part of the European Economic Recovery Plan, the Czech government announced the
following stimulus measures, equivalent to about 1 percent of GDP:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Cuts in employees’ social security contributions with a net budget cost of CZK
18.4 billion;
CZK 14.4 billion contribution to construction and modernization of infrastructure
within the State Fund of Transport and Infrastructure;
Increase of salaries in the government sector by CZK 2.7 billion following a decrease
in public sector salaries in real terms in 2008;
Increase of capital of the Czech Export Bank (CEB) and other export promoting
institutions by some CZK 2 billion;
Increase in the capital of Supporting Guarantee Agricultural and Forestry Fund by
CZK 0.3 billion;
CZK 0.6 billion investment incentives for technology centre projects;
CZK 0.5 billion for environment related projects, which are co-financed by EU
Funds.

The government is determined to cut, in 2009, expenses for CZK 15 billion, or 0.4 percent of
GDP. If approved by the parliament, these cuts will create budget room to absorb the cost of
additional structural measures to boost the domestic economy.
Resources from EU funds are expected to have an expansionary effect, without affecting the
general government balance.
(ii) Financial sector resilience
It is important to assess each country on its own merits and to avoid associating a country
with the problems in the region when this is not justified. The Czech Republic has managed
to avoid contagion from the financial turmoil. The main financial institutions remain sound,
well-capitalized and profitable. A comfortable level of local currency deposits shields these

3
institutions from liquidity strains and provides them with stable financing at reasonable costs
compared to other volatile external sources.
Although the Czech financial sector is not immune to the global financial crisis, its healthy
conditions have helped avoid financial distress. The Czech financial system was
comprehensively restructured and consolidated during the last decade. An independent
central bank conducted successfully monetary policy aimed toward maintaining price
stability. Financial regulation and supervision, covering the entire financial sector, was the
responsibility of the central bank which encouraged sound financial practices. This setting
has enabled domestic interest rates to be lower than in the eurozone, making foreign currency
loans not attractive for households and corporate borrowers.
The strengths of the Czech financial system, which is mainly foreign owned, are: (i) growth
opportunities in traditional banking and their reasonable profitability, (ii) negligible share of
structured credits, not exceeding 1 percent of total assets, and (iii) stable funding by local
deposits rather than by foreign funds. In the Czech Republic, the deposit to loan ratio is
double the average ratio in the original members of the European Union.
The Staff Report concludes that “concerns about the health of the banking sector have
intensified. Temporary withdrawals by depositors, contributing to a further tightening in
liquidity conditions…”. This was most likely a temporary episode stemming from
neighboring countries announcing more generous deposit insurance schemes. After the
alignment of the deposits guarantee scheme with the EU agreement in mid-October 2008,
covering 100 percent of deposits up to euro 50,000, withdrawal of deposits stopped. The staff
have also expressed concern about the high off-balance sheet liabilities. The Czech
authorities remain vigilant and monitor these developments. They would appreciate it if the
staff could provide a more detailed analysis and comparison with similar economies.
The staff caution against the quick and significant reduction of exposures of foreign banks in
the region. We would like to draw attention to the difference between a parent bank
withdrawing existing funds and not extending new financing. Subsidiaries of foreign banks,
with funding from local sources, as is mainly the case in the Czech Republic, are in a more
stable condition than subsidiaries and branches that rely on foreign currency funding from the
parent bank. In addition, the allocation of liquidity by a subsidiary to its foreign parent bank
is constrained by the prudential regulation limiting risk concentration on counterpart to
20 percent of own capital. Nonetheless, the CNB monitors the situation of the main financial
institutions daily in order to react without delay if appropriate. The banking law might be
amended to strengthen the supervisory system as needed.
(iii) Euro adoption prospects
The Czech authorities annually assess the extent to which economic conditions, in particular,
nominal and real convergence, are sufficiently aligned with the euro area. The Czech
Republic has been improving its sustainable macroeconomic convergence with the euro area
in all traditional indicators. Also, the government’s financial position is no longer a barrier to
fulfilling the Maastricht criteria, now that the excessive deficit procedure has been

4
terminated. Since the one-off inflationary effect that caused a temporary hike in inflation in
2008 has subsided, inflation in 2009 is expected to allow fulfillment of the price stability
criterion. The criterion on long-term interest rates has been and will continue to be fulfilled.
The Czech Republic does not participate in ERM II and, thus, does not fulfill the exchange
rate criterion. In addition, the present global financial crisis has increased the volatility of the
exchange rate, so fulfillment of the exchange rate criterion within ERM II could be difficult
and costly. Given the current assessment and the uncertain near-term outlook, the Ministry of
Finance and the CNB have recommended that the government should not set a target date for
adopting the Euro.
