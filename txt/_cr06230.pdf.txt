EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Canada’s macroeconomic and policy performance has continued to outshine most other
industrial countries and its outlook remains favorable. Fiscal and monetary policy
implementation has been enviable and, although the economy continues to face risks,
including of a possible disorderly unwinding of global imbalances, growth is projected to
remain at around its 3 percent potential and inflation to stay near its 2 percent target.
The Bank of Canada will need to balance evidence that slack is eroding against the drag
from an appreciated exchange rate and the potential for a disorderly unwinding of global
imbalances. Although further modest increases in the overnight rate will likely be required,
the Bank’s credibility allows a flexible response to macroeconomic developments. The
success of the inflation targeting framework suggests no need for significant amendments
when it is renewed later this year, but there is some room to enhance policy communication.
The new government has pledged to maintain the strong social consensus in favor of fiscal
surpluses—including debt reduction by C$3 billion (about ¼ percent of GDP) per year—
while aiming at enhancing incentives to save and invest. The emphasis on limiting
government spending seems appropriate, and the challenge will be to translate this into
specific measures. Planned cuts in corporate rates and the early elimination of the federal
capital tax are warranted. Cutting the consumption tax rate would also provide economic
benefits, although personal income tax cuts could be a more effective use of resources.
The new budget will need to ensure that a prudent fiscal framework is maintained. There
would be considerable merit in raising the size of budgetary reserves, anchoring policies on a
debt objective over a 5-10 year horizon, and providing an annual analysis of long-term
budget prospects by an independent body to emphasize the need for debt reduction.
Addressing fiscal pressures at the provincial level will also be necessary to support longerterm fiscal sustainability. There remains a case for allowing provinces greater flexibility in
using price and other market-based mechanisms to help align the demand and supply for
health care. Any new allocation formula for the Equalization system (which addresses
horizontal imbalances across provinces) should take resource-based revenues into account.
The favorable domestic and external environment provides the new government an
important opportunity to boost the economy’s long-term growth potential. Despite robust
growth, Canada’s productivity performance has been less impressive. In addition to lowering
the tax burden, reforms could include: in the labor market, reducing welfare walls, making
immigration systems more flexible, and restoring reforms of the Employment Insurance
system; in product markets, reducing barriers to foreign direct investment and reforming the
electricity sector; in trade and agriculture, widening market access for agricultural goods.
While the financial system appears well placed to support growth, there is still room to
furthering its efficiency and resilience. Priorities include providing greater clarity on the
regulatory framework governing bank mergers, establishing a national securities regulator,
and better aligning incentives of defined benefit pension plan sponsors and members.

I. INTRODUCTION

2.
The boom in global commodity
prices has significantly improved
Canada’s economic prospects but also
complicates macroeconomic management.
High world oil prices have improved the
financial viability of Canada’s enormous
oil sands, boosting the country’s role as a
major energy exporter (Box 1 and
Annex I). However, the attendant
significant appreciation of the real
exchange rate required a shift of resources
toward the oil and gas sector in the western
provinces, creating economic frictions and
widening gaps in fiscal capacity between
resource-rich and resource-poor provinces.

The Conservative Party formed a minority government following the January 23
general election. The new government has promised to focus on “five priorities,” including
raising accountability in government, reducing crime, lowering consumption taxes, providing
choice and support for child care, and reducing wait times for medical procedures. It also
pledged to reduce the role of government and work toward reducing federal-provincial
“fiscal imbalances.” However, its minority status in parliament may limit the room for policy
maneuver.

Box 1. Canada as an Energy Exporter1
Canada’s oil sands—located almost exclusively in Alberta—contain one of the world’s largest known
hydrocarbon deposits. The cost of extracting much of the oil had been prohibitively expensive, but
improved technology and higher oil prices have made them economical. Recoverable oil is estimated at
about one sixth of global reserves.
Capital spending on oil sands projects is projected to continue to increase sharply, but there are
obstacles to exploiting oil sands deposits:
•

Limited infrastructure and difficulties in attracting skilled labor have boosted costs.

•

Canada’s natural gas output is expected to peak in about 10 years’ time. With natural gas a key
input for oil sands production, this could pose a serious long-term cost problem.

•

Greenhouse gas emissions created by oil sands production are likely to conflict with Canada’s
Kyoto Accord commitments.

Most forecasters assume that projects will come on stream gradually. Production projections tend to
imply a tripling of oil sands production volume to 2½–3 million barrels per day (mb/d) over 10 years.
With conventional oil output already past its peak, Canada’s total oil production would increase from
2.5 mb/d in 2003 to about 4 mb/d by 2015.
Rising oil production will affect the domestic economy in a number of important ways:
•

Domestic demand. Extraction of oil sands uses large amounts of capital and labor, which should
push up demand and income outside the energy sector as well as outside Alberta.

•

Government revenues. While royalties and resource taxes accrue primarily to Alberta, the
federal government and other provinces would benefit from higher sales tax and corporate
income tax revenue.

•

Balance of Payments. At current energy prices, Canada’s current account balance could improve
by about ½ percent of GDP by 2015.

Staff analysis suggests, however, that the impact on Canada’s real effective exchange rate would be
small. The staff’s model also indicates that most of the recent appreciation of the Canadian dollar against
the U.S. dollar has been driven by fundamentals.
Although oil output will rise in coming years,
Canada’s future as an energy-exporting
country will depend on finding technological
solutions to overcome production obstacles.
Gas exports are expected to fall sharply after
2015 as reserves are exhausted. Therefore, oil
sands production would need to increase
rapidly to maintain Canada’s energy trade
balance. This will require significant
investments in public and private infrastructure,
improvements in extraction techniques, curbing
the use of natural gas in oil sands production,
and limiting greenhouse gas emissions.

Against this background, the mission focused on the challenges of maintaining a
balanced expansion and supporting economic flexibility and long-term growth in the face
of population aging:1
•

Following a series of interest rate increases since the fall, the monetary stance has
become less accommodative, and while further modest increases in the overnight rate
will be required, the Bank of Canada will need to weigh carefully signs that slack has
eroded against the drag from currency appreciation and risks from global imbalances.

•

The new government will need to demonstrate its commitment to budget discipline as
it delivers on promised tax relief. In addition, reform of the health care system
remains key to long-term fiscal sustainability.

•

On the structural front, the challenge will be to boost productivity as labor-intensive
growth from rising participation over the last decade slows. While the Canadian
economy remains highly flexible, there seems scope to streamline FDI, trade, and
labor market regulations with a view to encourage foreign investment and boost
domestic competition.
II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

5.
The economy has maintained momentum even in the face of last year’s rapid
currency appreciation (Table 2). Real GDP growth was close to 3 percent during 2005
(Q4/Q4 basis), reflecting a strong expansion in construction, services, and resource
industries. Final domestic demand rose a robust 4½ percent, which more than offset a drop in
inventory investment and net exports:

Box 2. Effectiveness and Role of Fund Surveillance
•

Past Fund advice. Staff have been highly supportive of Canada’s strong institutional framework and
continuing structural reforms. Although the authorities have resisted suggestions to reform the
Employment Insurance system, policies in general—and the adoption of a medium-term debt target
in the FY 2004–05 budget and recent increases in monetary policy transparency, in particular—have
been in line with staff recommendations.

•

A recent academic study—based on interviews with Department of Finance officials—came to
mixed conclusions on the effectiveness of Fund surveillance.1 The study found that Fund staff
came with “sophisticated expertise and technical advice,” “demonstrated intellect and insight about
the Canadian economy,” and had the “big picture.” However, Fund reports were generally found to
be less valuable than those by the OECD because they were less “user-friendly,” contained more
limited use of cross-country comparisons, and were less focused on issues of immediate interest to
policy makers.

•

Targeted advice. Staff have recently provided focused analyses in response to specific requests by
Canadian authorities:

•

•

Fiscal forecasting. At the authorities’ request, last year the staff prepared an international
comparison of fiscal forecasting procedures and outcomes, utilized by an independent report on
the same topic, which in turn was cited in the November 2005 Budget Update.

•

Review of Bank of Canada research and analysis. At the authorities’ request, staff has
provided the Board of Governors of the Bank of Canada with bi-annual assessments of the
Bank’s research and communications strategy. This year, the presentation was also given to
Governor Dodge and Senior Deputy Governor Jenkins. In addition, the Bank of Canada has
been actively involved in both using and developing the Fund’s Global Economic Model.

The Role of the Fund. Senior Canadian policymakers have recently offered a number of suggestions
for strengthening Fund surveillance. Bank of Canada Governor Dodge and Finance Minister
Flaherty both called on the Fund to focus more on multilateral surveillance, better integrate financial
sector analysis into country reviews, put more emphasis on exchange rates, and define the roles of
the Board, management, and staff more concretely.2 They suggested that the Fund’s primary role
should be to promote a market-based international monetary order, acting as a forum for developing
the “rules of the game” and as an “umpire” making impartial calls as to whether the rules were being
followed.

The growth of government consumption and investment was more moderate,

Net exports continued to be a drag on activity (Table 3). Real exports, supported by
strong external demand, expanded almost 5 percent over the course of 2005, but this was
more than offset by a 6½ percent increase in real imports, which were spurred by a strong
currency. Nonetheless, soaring energy prices buoyed the nominal trade balance and the
current account.

After a modest retreat in the early months of 2005, the Canadian dollar has
resumed its appreciation. The dollar has gained some 30 percent in real effective terms since
early 2003 and has risen to highs not seen since the early 1990s, partly reflecting market
responses to growing actual and expected energy export revenues and foreign investment in
Canada’s oil and gas sector. Assessing Canada’s competitiveness is complicated by
movements in the terms of trade as well as growing penetration of low cost producers in the
U.S. and domestic markets. However, while the currency’s strength has crimped
manufacturing employment, the exchange rate appears largely in line with underlying

-9-

fundamentals, with much of the recent appreciation reflecting the boom in energy and other
commodity prices (staff analysis is summarized in Annex I).2 Multilateral analysis conducted
by the IMF’s Research Department suggests that the exchange rate is up to 15 percent
undervalued when compared with equilibrium saving-investment balances. However, the gap
is smaller using the methodology that calculates purchasing power parities and takes the
improvement in the terms of trade into account.

Most indicators suggest that the
economy is operating at around potential.
The unemployment rate has fallen to
6¼ percent—a 31-year low—reflecting
employment growth in the commodityproducing western provinces but also in the
central provinces, where losses in export
industries have been offset by gains in
construction and services. Both the staff and
the Bank of Canada estimate a negligible
output gap.

statement, the Bank indicated that “modest” further tightening may be needed, which was
interpreted by financial markets as suggesting that rates would rise by only a further 25-50
basis points through end-2006. As in the rest of the world, yields on long-term government
bonds remain close to historic lows in real and nominal terms, even after modest recent rises.

The fiscal outlook remains very favorable. Buoyant personal income tax collections
and large corporate income tax payments are expected to lead to a surplus in FY2005/06
(ending in March). The disposition of projected budget surpluses was a key focus of the preelection debate. The new government has pledged a range of tax cuts and spending restraint
that—if fully implemented—would be consistent with their commitment to pay down federal
debt by at least C$3 billion (about ¼ percent of GDP a year).

III. OUTLOOK AND RISKS
13.
The staff and most other forecasters expected the economy to stay close to capacity,
growing at around 3 percent in 2006 and 2007. Although real net exports are expected to
decline in 2006 as a result of the recent currency appreciation, Canada’s improved terms of
trade would lend continued support to domestic demand.
14.

Short-term risks to the outlook are evenly balanced:

•

On the upside, higher energy and other commodity prices could further support
incomes and domestic demand. Recent increases in energy prices and associated
exchange rate appreciation had spurred a reallocation of resources from the east to the
emerging center of activity in the west, from consumption to business investment, and
from export-based manufacturing to import-intensive services, which officials
observed had gone remarkably smoothly (Chapter 1 of the Selected Issues paper
reports staff analysis of the regional impact of oil prices and other shocks on the
Canadian economy). Officials agreed that a further appreciation of the currency could
not be ruled out, given the strength of commodity prices and global current account
imbalances. Nonetheless, they were confident that the economy was flexible enough
to facilitate smooth further adjustment.

•

On the downside, the economy is vulnerable to a sharper-than-expected slowdown in
U.S. activity. With exports to the United States accounting for about 35 percent of
GDP, a slowing of the U.S. housing market and subsequent drop in U.S. consumer
demand would weigh heavily on Canada. Also, a sharp drop in commodity prices

global external imbalances. An alternative
scenario by the staff indeed suggests that a major decline in U.S. activity, a large drop in
commodity prices, and a sharp appreciation of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. currency
could combine in a “perfect storm” that would pose intense challenges both to the economy
and financial sector (Appendix III).

16.
The staff cautioned that domestic saving-investment balances also posed risks. As
in other cyclically advanced countries, a rise in household wealth has coincided with strong
consumption growth, leaving the personal saving rate close to zero. At the same time, strong

corporate sector into a net lender to the
rest of the economy.4 Although

surpluses, and declining government and

suggested that interest rate or other
shocks could lead the household saving
rate to adjust abruptly.

As households have reduced saving, corporations have
become net lenders.

participants were more sanguine about
the household saving rate. Given buoyant household wealth, they saw little risk of a sharp
contraction in private consumption. Moreover, vulnerabilities associated with the Canadian
housing market were limited by the fact that refinancing and home equity withdrawals had
not played a major role in financing consumption, and that the sub-prime loan market was
less developed than in the United States.

18.
The staff shared the authorities’ concern about trends in labor productivity, which
had slowed since 2000 because of a sharp decrease in capital deepening. As a result, and
also reflecting the frictions associated with the shift of resources into the booming energy
sector, the Bank of Canada had shaded down its estimate of potential output growth in 2005
and 2006. However, there were emerging signs that the drop in the price of imported capital
goods associated with the strong exchange rate was boosting business investment, providing
a potential upside risk to productivity growth.
IV. MONETARY POLICY AND THE EXCHANGE RATE
19.
Bank of Canada officials and staff agreed that some further increases in short-term
interest rates would likely be needed, given that monetary policy remained mildly
accommodative. At the same time, officials noted that medium- to longer-term risks were
tilted to the downside, owing to the possibility of a disorderly unwinding of global current
account imbalances. Indeed, as a small open economy closely integrated with the United
States, Canada was particularly vulnerable to the risk of a U.S. dollar depreciation or a
broader global slowdown. Against this background, the Bank had been careful to emphasize
that it was being more cautious in raising interest rates than otherwise, accepting the
possibility that domestic output could rise somewhat above potential in the near term. Staff
agreed that the Bank’s firm commitment to price stability afforded room to maintain a policy

4

saving and net lending.

- 14 -

stance that took into account risks beyond the Bank’s usual 6–8 quarter horizon without
unduly jeopardizing the inflation target.
20.
Officials viewed the recent appreciation of the Canadian dollar as consistent with
the need to rebalance external and domestic demand in the face of improving terms of
trade. Although the exchange rate had gained somewhat more in strength than officials had
expected in the fall of 2005, an appreciating currency was consistent with strong demand for
Canadian exports and the surge in energy and other commodity prices. Staff agreed with this
assessment, noting that the mission’s background analysis (summarized in Annex I)
confirmed preliminary work by Bank of Canada staff that found energy prices having a
greater impact on the exchange rate than earlier believed.
21.
The team commended the Bank’s commitment to transparency but suggested that
there could be room to further improve communication. For example, best practice at other
central banks suggested scope for providing greater detail on assumptions and risks,
particularly on those “fixed action dates” that were not followed by a Monetary Policy
Report (MPR).5 Officials responded that the Bank had steadily expanded the scope of MPRs,
but they preferred not to publish detailed forecasts—including of interest rates and exchange
rates—since these could be misinterpreted by markets as targets. Moreover, adding detail
would make it difficult to publish MPRs just two days after fixed action dates.
22.
Canada’s inflation targeting framework is due for renewal later in 2006. Bank of
Canada officials indicated a range of issues had been reviewed, including modifying the
definition of core inflation, reducing the inflation target, and shifting to a form of price-level
targeting as a way of lowering nominal interest rate volatility.6 Consideration was also being
given to lengthening the horizon for achieving the inflation target, especially in the presence
of asset price disturbances. However, officials did not expect significant changes in the
present round, concurring with the team that the success of the current framework suggested
the burden of proof for adopting different arrangements would be high (the role played by
inflation targeting and credibility in strengthening the monetary transmission mechanism is
discussed in Chapter 2 of the Selected Issues paper).
V. FISCAL POLICY
23.
Canada has achieved eight consecutive years of federal surpluses and falling
government debt, creating a strong social consensus for prudent fiscal policies (Table 5).
This reflected an informal fiscal rule maintained by the previous government that included
commitments to “balanced budgets or better” each year, the maintenance of a ¼ percent of
GDP contingency reserve as well as a macroeconomic prudence factor that rose by
5

The Bank typically has eight fixed action dates—i.e., dates on which interest announcements occur—each
year, but only four such announcements are followed by full MPRs or MPR Updates.
6

Under price level targeting, higher-than-anticipated inflation lowers future inflation expectations, thereby
raising the expected real interest rate even without nominal hikes.

Officials explained that the

campaign included a 2 percentage point
reduction in the goods and services tax
(GST), with the first percentage point to be
implemented immediately, and cuts in a
range of taxes on business over the coming
five years. The campaign platform also
called for limiting direct “program

affairs) to inflation plus population growth,
with the objective of paying down federal
debt by at least C$3 billion a year.

The projections are based on the baseline provided by the authorities' November 2005 Update. Revenues would grow at
an annual average of around 4 percent over the planning horizon, partly resulting from high energy prices, and spending is
expected to grow by an annual average of 4.5 percent. Staff projections adjust this base case for differences in
macroeconomic assumptions and for the measures from the new government's platform, including two 1-percentage point
cuts in the GST (one taking place immediately and the second one in FY 2010/11); cuts in a range of business taxes; a new
child care allowance of C$1200 a year for every child under six (at a cost of C$1.9 billion per year); and reductions in
direct program spending growth excluding defense and Indian affairs to inflation plus population growth. Any part of the
projected annual budgetary surplus (annual average of about C$7.5 billion) above the C$3 billion earmarked for debt
reduction is assumed to lead to extra spending and tax cuts in equal measure.

suggested that a cut in personal income tax rates and lowering taxes on saving would be more
likely to stimulate labor supply, as well as saving and investment, than a lowering of the GST
rate, a result also consistent with earlier work by the Department of Finance.8 The
consumption tax rate was low by international standards and maintaining its current level
would also help to protect the tax base as the retiree population rose. Officials responded that
any tax cut—including the GST—would lead to efficiency gains, and noted that the GST was
highly unpopular.
26.
On the spending side, staff noted that difficult decisions would be needed to achieve
the planned expenditure containment. These goals seemed ambitious given that they would
be over and above the cuts already identified in the ongoing Expenditure Review, and in
view of the agreed increase in transfers to the provinces. The team also noted that some
targeting of the proposed child care allowance (a blanket C$1,200 per child under six) could
lower the fiscal cost. Officials agreed that it would be a challenge to achieve the
government’s limits on spending growth, but emphasized that the government’s approach
would be disciplined and pragmatic, and that the limits were an appropriate response to the
large increase in outlays that had occurred in recent years. As for the new child allowance,
officials noted that the government’s goal was to provide parents with resources to choose
the appropriate form of child care, and that means testing could exacerbate already high
effective marginal income taxes at lower income levels.
8

In December 2005, the previous government passed two small personal income tax cuts. The government has
yet to announce whether these cuts will be repealed.

- 17 -

27.
It was still not clear how much of the previous fiscal framework would be retained,
but officials underscored the new government’s commitment to paying down debt. In
particular, they pointed to the plan to pay down C$3 billion in debt each year and noted that
the previous framework had led to biased fiscal forecasts—e.g., persistently higher-thanexpected surpluses—undermining both transparency and parliamentary oversight. Moreover,
with government accountability a key priority of the new government, it had pledged to
establish a new Parliamentary Budgetary Authority and require more accurate and timely
budget forecasts.
28.
The team responded that, given
the uncertainties surrounding budget
forecasts, achieving the new debt
reduction objective would require a
significant increase in budgetary reserves.
The O’Neill Report—commissioned by the
previous government and written with
input from Fund staff—argued that a
cushion of about C$9 billion (¾ percent of
GDP; 2–3 times the amount of past
contingency reserves) would be needed to
be reasonably certain of avoiding a budget
deficit. A similarly high cushion will be
needed to assure a C$3 billion minimum
debt repayment.

Surpluses have consistently been larger than
expected.

29.
With the retirement of the baby boom generation imminent, the mission suggested
elevating the role of public debt reduction as a fiscal policy objective.9 The staff argued that
adopting a debt objective over a 5–10 year horizon would help anchor policies in the face of
unexpected events that might make it difficult to achieve planned debt reduction in a given
year. In addition, the team suggested further solidifying the social consensus for prudent
fiscal policies by regular publication of an annual analysis of long-term budget prospects,
thereby highlighting the fiscal challenges of an aging population.
30.
Staff and officials agreed that it was essential to control the growth of health care
spending (Box 3). Federal officials pointed out that spending increases in recent years had to
some extent made up for large cuts in the early 1990s, which had helped Canada to become
the only large industrial country to keep growth in health spending close to nominal GDP
growth for more than a decade. The new government would adhere to the federal-provincial
Health Accord of September 2004, which had fixed a 10-year path for federal funding of
provincial health plans. The government would also work with provinces to establish wait

Box 3. Canada’s Health System1
Canada’s health care system involves both federal and provincial governments. While delivery is the
responsibility of provincial governments, the Canada Health Act (CHA) establishes the following
principles:
•
•
•
•
•

Public administration. Health plans are operated by provincial and territorial governments;
Comprehensiveness. Plans must cover all CHA services;
Universality. All residents are entitled to insured health services;
Portability. Coverage is not restricted by place of residence; and
Accessibility. Provinces and territories may not restrict access to insured health services,
including by ability to pay.

These principles have been interpreted as precluding charges for medically necessary services covered
by the Act. Moreover, provisions under the CHA require a cut in federal transfers to provinces that
permit such changes.
While health care is the largest provincial expenditure, the federal government covers a significant
part of the costs. Federal transfers to provinces include direct payments under the Canada Health
Transfer (separated from transfers for social

frictions with provinces over federal support, in

Even with increased funding, however, the
public health system faces a range of
challenges. With CHA’s services provided
free, demand has been contained in recent years
through rising wait times, while provincial
support for rapidly growing spending on
prescription drugs (not covered under the
CHA) has added to budget strains. Partly as a
result, the proportion of total health spending
covered by individuals has increased steadily to
around 30 percent.

Recent court cases and reform plans underline strains on the existing public health system. Last year,
the Supreme Court ruled that Quebec’s policy prohibiting private insurance and restricting access to
hospitals by doctors who have opted out of medicare violated the Quebec Charter of Human Rights and
Freedoms. In a more recent case, an Ontario tribunal ruled that the province must reimburse a Toronto
woman for a hip replacement surgery performed in Florida after it found the long expected wait time for
the procedure in Canada would cause “medically significant irreversible tissue damage.”

team’s suggestion that opening the system
to more market mechanisms, including to user charges, could help better equilibrate supply
and demand, officials observed the only strict mandate under the CHA was to prohibit
charges for medically necessary services.

32.
The new government was committed to addressing vertical and horizontal financial
imbalances between the federal and provincial governments. Encouragingly, officials
suggested that concerns over an unequal distribution of fiscal resources and responsibilities
between the center and the provinces seemed to have dissipated as most of the latter were
now running budget surpluses. As for horizontal imbalances, an expert panel was to provide
recommendations this year for amending the system of equalization payments, which was
designed to reduce differences in revenue bases across provinces. The mission questioned
whether the current system was adequately taking account of disparities in natural resource
endowments, especially given last year’s decision to largely exempt royalties from offshore
oil and gas production for some provinces. Officials responded that the authorities were
committed to maintaining these earlier agreements and that the reforms would likely focus on
reducing the complexity of the existing system and the volatility of payments.
33.
During discussions with Alberta officials, the team mentioned Norway as a
successful example for using investment funds to share windfall fiscal gains with future
generations. Benefiting from its natural resource base, Alberta has become essentially debtfree in 2005, and its tax rates are considerably lower than in other provinces. Concerning the
future use of government surpluses, officials noted that C$1 billion had recently been

invested in Alberta’s Heritage Savings Trust Fund—the first such deposit since 1987.11 They
did not rule out similar deposits going forward, but explained that the government was now
focused on improving infrastructure and education to boost the province’s production
potential in future years, consistent with the nonrenewable nature of its resources.
VI. POLICIES TO INCREASE ECONOMIC EFFICIENCY AND FLEXIBILITY
34.
Canada’s productivity performance in recent years has been somewhat
disappointing. Fast growth has chiefly stemmed from an increase in labor participation, and
both investment and total factor productivity growth have lagged behind U.S. rates. While
this trend continues to present somewhat of a puzzle, the most convincing explanation relates
to a lack of capital deepening during the 1990s, a consequence of labor costs being low
relative to the costs of mostly imported capital goods. However, especially in light of
demographic trends that will significantly reduce the share of the working age population,
and the importance of a flexible response of labor and capital to the opportunities presented
by the sharp improvement in Canada’s terms of trade, the team focused the discussions on
policies that could help sustain growth and incomes.
Productivity growth has fallen short of that in the

A. Taxes, Benefits, and Domestic Regulation
35.
A key focus of the new government is to “reward effort” including by lowering

Labor Force Participation and Productivity
Higher labor force participation growth tends to be associated with lower
measured productivity growth, both in levels and in growth rates. Adjusted
for this effect, Canada's productivity performance since the mid-1990s has
been closer to the international experience.

Staff welcomed the emphasis on
reducing the overall tax burden, but
observed that Canada’s marginal
effective corporate tax rates would still be
relatively high. Indeed, U.S. rates could be
a misleading benchmark, since these were
well above those in countries such as
Sweden and Australia.12 Officials replied
that Canada’s close economic linkages
implied that the highest priority was to
avoid a loss of tax competitiveness vis-àvis the United States, and that driving rates
below U.S. levels was of limited
effectiveness in attracting capital since the
United States taxed its firms on the basis of
global incomes. They also noted that
marginal effective rates would fall
significantly by 2010 when further tax
reductions would be in place.

The mission voiced concern about the rollback in recent years of earlier reforms
in the Employment Insurance (EI) program. While staff analysis (summarized in Annex
I) suggested Canadian labor markets were relatively efficient by international standards, the
elimination of the intensity rule and the introduction of new pilot projects aimed at
enhancing benefits in high unemployment areas could hinder labor market flexibility, and
there was scope for reducing social benefits provided through the EI program. Officials
observed that it had been important to raise benefits to ensure fairness for the most
vulnerable regions, and cited a recent Supreme Court ruling that had supported the federal
government’s right to provide social benefits under the program.13 They also noted that
premiums had been lowered significantly and were now being set in a transparent manner,

Officials agreed that adjusting CPP
benefits along these lines could improve labor market attachment among the elderly,
although provincial agreement would be needed to make such changes.

39.
Officials agreed that a more flexible immigration policy could help ease current
labor shortages, particularly in the west. The key priority was not necessarily to encourage
larger numbers of immigrants, but to increase the number of those whose skills matched the
demand of the economy. At the same time, many immigrants seemed to be finding it difficult
to succeed in the labor market, suggesting the need for increased settlement and integration
services of the type pledged by the new government.
40.
Officials agreed with staff on the necessity to remove the remaining restrictions on
internal trade and facilitate internal labor mobility. Provinces had achieved progress on a
dispute settlement process, and negotiations on energy had reached an advanced stage,
coupled with plans to develop a pan-Canadian energy strategy this summer. A federal
initiative was launched in April 2005 to advance the recognition of foreign credentials, and
provinces had made the elimination of other barriers to labor mobility a key priority.
41.
The mission suggested that there was room for more ambitious product market
reform, including by improving the attractiveness of Canada as an investment destination
(Box 5). OECD indicators imply that Canada’s product market regulation has reverted to the
(GDP-weighted) average of the G-7 since the late 1990s. By contrast, Australia—another
highly successful economy over the last decade—has moved further ahead of this yardstick,
including by reforming its electricity sector. As regards foreign investment, the Investment
Canada Act’s restrictions on foreign ownership in network industries and thresholds for
review appeared restrictive and might be discouraging resource and technology transfer.
While some officials were sympathetic with this view, others responded that the investment
screening requirements provided a rarely used but necessary safeguard.

This remarkable achievement partly reflects the effects of
falling tax wedges on secondary earners. While the wedge
on primary workers has stayed relatively stable since 1996,
that on secondary earners has fallen steadily. This
divergence reflects policies such as the enhancement of the
child credit in 1997 and the introduction of the working
income supplement for working poor in the 1996/97 budget.
In addition, child care reforms have supported female
labor market participation. Federal maternity and parental
leave benefits have been expanded and provision of publicly
provided childcare has improved. At the provincial level,
Quebec has introduced a comprehensive family support
policy in 1997 while elsewhere fee subsidization is available
for low-income and other needy groups, and there is an
implicit subsidy through the Child Care Expense Deduction.

and child care system. The secondary earner’s tax wedge
acts as a disincentive to labor participation while childcare benefits encourage women to enter the labor market. Further
reforms to reduce the tax wedge on secondary earners would help further support female participation, although the
proposed family allowance unrelated to labor market activity is unlikely to have a significant effect. More generally, the
analysis underlines the potential role of policies in supporting participation of the aged and the poor, where Canada’s
performance is average by international standards.

Box 5. Structural Reforms and Economic Growth: Canada and Australia1
Both Canada and Australia have grown rapidly over the last decade, supported by sound macroeconomic
frameworks and structural reform programs. As major commodity producers, both countries are relatively
exposed to external shocks. Nonetheless, inflation targeting has yielded near price stability in both countries,
and prudent fiscal frameworks have delivered significant reduction in public debt—Australia’s net government
debt is negligible, and debt has fallen to under 40 percent of GDP in Canada. Concomitantly, average economic
growth since 1995 has increased in both countries relative to the 1981–1994 period and to the GDP-weighted
average growth of the “G-6” (i.e., G-7 nations excluding Canada).

• However, the rise in Australia’s per capita GDP growth reflects an increase in labor productivity growth,
while in Canada the faster growth largely reflects higher labor utilization. Consistent with this observation,
OECD structural reform indicators, which are derived from measures of competitiveness in specific market
segments, suggest that Australia has moved ahead of Canada and the GDP-weighted G–6 in the product
markets, while Canada continues to have a more flexible labor market. Specifically:
• Product market reform. Commencing in
the mid-1980s, Australia’s “National
Competition Policy” gradually reformed
product markets toward OECD ‘best practice’
status in the electricity, airlines, post, and road
sectors—surpassing Canada’s overall
benchmark index by the mid-1990s.2 By
contrast, Canada has reverted to the G–6
average, and the OECD has noted that Canada
could undertake further reforms in its
electricity and rail sectors. In addition,
corporate effective tax rates remain high.

• Labor markets. Canada’s continuing advantage rests in the labor market, despite some rolling back of
reforms to Canada’s Employment Insurance system in recent years. Australia passed important labor reforms in
the mid-1990s, which linked wages more closely to productivity by greatly decentralizing the wage-setting
process. In late 2005, legislation was approved to reduce dismissal costs for small companies, narrow the range
of minimum working conditions, and establish a new commission to determine minimum wage increases.
With gains from higher labor market participation likely to diminish in Canada, Australia’s experience
suggests that further product market reforms could help improve Canada’s labor productivity. Of particular
benefit would be the removal of restrictions on inter-provincial trade and FDI. In particular, provincial
governments could aim to increase competition in sectors dominated by government-owned firms (e.g.,
electricity), possibly through privatization as occurred in Australia and in the Canadian gas industry.

lack of progress in addressing regulatory
issues related to bank mergers and securities markets:

- 27 -

•

Bank mergers. Officials reported that there was still a considerable debate on the size
of efficiency gains that might result from mergers among Canada’s large financial
institutions, and how these might be weighed against competition and other
considerations.

•

Securities market regulation. Although most provinces continued to oppose the
introduction of a national securities regulator, officials explained that the need to
harmonize regulatory regimes across provinces was widely recognized. Provinces had
agreed on key objectives, including better enforcement of existing regulations and
representation on the international scene, but progress had been hampered by
disagreements over the final regulatory setup.

44.
Given the underfunding of many defined benefit (DB) plans, staff welcomed
progress on reforming regulation of corporate pension plans. Officials noted that the
decline in solvency ratios had largely been a consequence of the low interest rate
environment and an upward revision of average life expectancy in actuarial assumptions,
although the incentives for sponsors to maintain financial contributions needed to be
strengthened. Measures under discussion included extending tax preferences for plan
overfunding, addressing perceived asymmetries in the distribution of plan surpluses, and an
extension of the period over which pension funds had to restore solvency. Such initiatives
would also help maintain a system where DB and defined contribution plans both remained
viable options.
45.
Officials reported that significant harmonization of corporate governance rules
with the United States had taken place. The focus had been on strengthening enforcement,
improving financial reporting and disclosure, enhancing the quality of the audit process and
strengthening management accountability. However, the Canadian Securities Administrators
had decided against requiring auditor certification of internal controls over financial
reporting, in part reflecting the high cost of reporting particularly for smaller firms.
46.
Officials explained that the string of fiscal surpluses was increasingly affecting the
government’s ability to maintain depth and liquidity in benchmark bond issues. Annual
bond issuance had fallen quite dramatically, and the government was running out of bonds to
buy back without “cannibalizing” some key benchmark issues. Staff agreed that converting
Crown Corporation debt—which is backed by the full faith and credit of the government—to
government bonds could boost liquidity of the government’s benchmark issues and save up
to 10–15 basis points in liquidity premium.14

Officials observed that progress had been made during the Hong Kong Ministerial
Conference, but acknowledged that more had to be done. They viewed the outcome of the

Crown Corporation debt amounts to about one tenth of outstanding government debt and, at C$11 billion,
new issuance would significantly deepen the government’s current C$30–35 billion issuance of new securities.

In response to the mission’s call for Canadian leadership in liberalizing access to agricultural

Officials noted that progress had been made in addressing the Canada-U.S.
softwood lumber dispute. The recent reduction in the U.S. anti-dumping duty had been
helpful, and officials cautiously welcomed the U.S. decision to rescind the Byrd amendment
going forward. However, they expressed frustration that dispute settlement procedures
appeared to have been relatively ineffective in this case, an issue that had broader
ramifications for a rules-based international trading system. However, they did not see the

VII. STAFF APPRAISAL
50.
Canada’s macroeconomic and policy performance has continued to exceed most
other industrial countries and its outlook remains favorable. Employment continues to
expand at a solid pace and the boom in energy prices has provided considerable support to
domestic incomes, while taking the external current account surplus to a record high. Fiscal
and monetary policy implementation in recent years has been enviable, underpinned by firm
commitments to avoiding fiscal deficits and to an inflation target. Although the economy
continues to face risks, including those related to the low household saving rate and a
possible disorderly unwinding of global imbalances, growth is expected to remain at around
its underlying potential of 3 percent through 2007, with inflation returning to the 2 percent
target.
51.
The favorable domestic and external environment provides the new government an
important opportunity to boost the economy’s long-term growth potential. Despite a robust
expansion in recent years and unemployment dropping to a 31-year low, productivity growth
has been less impressive. In addition to maintaining prudent fiscal and monetary policies—

- 29 -

and especially in the face of the coming retirement of the baby boom generation and global
competition—there remains a need to further improve the economy’s flexibility.
52.
The Bank of Canada has appropriately continued to withdraw stimulus in recent
months. Looking forward, the support to activity from high commodity prices will need to be
balanced against the drag from an appreciated exchange rate—which remains valued in line
with fundamentals, including favorable terms of trade—and the potential for an abrupt
unwinding of global current account imbalances. Although further modest increases in the
overnight rate will likely be required to bring inflation back to target, the Bank’s credible
commitment to price stability provides scope to respond flexibly to macroeconomic
developments. While Canada’s inflation targeting framework is due for renewal this year, the
success achieved thus far does not suggest the need for significant amendments. The Bank is
highly transparent but further progress could be made in communicating key assumptions
underlying policy decisions, including the risks to the outlook.
53.
The new government has declared a welcome commitment to lowering the tax
burden, maintaining fiscal surpluses, and continuing debt reduction. The emphasis on
limiting government spending is appropriate, but the challenge will be to identify areas where
cuts can be implemented to accommodate the new government’s priorities. Planned
reductions in corporate rates and the early elimination of the federal capital tax are also
warranted given the relatively high level of Canada’s marginal effective corporate tax rates.
However, rather than cutting the GST rate, reducing marginal personal income tax rates and
increasing tax-deferred saving limits would seem a more effective use of scarce fiscal
resources. In particular, shifting the tax burden from income toward consumption would
improve incentives to save and invest, while supporting revenues as the population ages.
54.
The new budget will also need to ensure that a prudent fiscal framework is
maintained. To be sure, under the previous budget rule fiscal outturns surprised on the
upside, although this partly reflected the unexpected strength of commodity prices and
growth whose permanence is uncertain. Given the significant uncertainties surrounding
budget forecasts and the federal debt ratio still around 40 percent of GDP, there would seem
merit in raising budgetary reserves and anchoring policies on a debt objective over a 5–
10 year horizon. The social consensus for prudent fiscal policies could be further supported
by an annual analysis of long-term budget prospects by an independent body, providing a
regular reminder that debt reduction is needed to face the challenges of population aging.
55.
Addressing fiscal stresses at the provincial level will also be necessary to support
longer-term fiscal sustainability:
•

Provincial/territorial health outlays are rising at a rapid rate and the system remains
under considerable pressure. The agreement to lock in federal health transfers over
the next 10 years provides provinces with appropriate incentives and opportunities to
improve both the efficiency and quality of health care systems. However, there
remains a case for allowing provinces greater flexibility in using price and other
market-based mechanisms to help align the demand and supply for health care.

- 30 -

•

The forthcoming review of the Equalization system offers the opportunity to ensure
that regional disparities in fiscal capacity are not exacerbated by the boom in oil and
gas revenues. It would be appropriate to ensure that any new allocation formula takes
resource-based revenues into account.

56.
Although Canada has been among the fastest growing industrial countries in
recent years, its productivity performance has been less encouraging. Looking ahead,
economic potential could be boosted by placing priority on the following areas:
•

Labor markets. There is a need for continuing to place priority on reducing welfare
walls to improve labor participation among low income groups, amending
immigration systems to help address skills shortages, and simplifying the recognition
of occupational qualifications across provinces. Consideration could also be given to
funding the Employment Insurance system’s parental and other social benefits
through general revenues, rather than the payroll tax, and to curbing extended
regional benefits, in order to reduce the system’s adverse effects on employment and
economic efficiency.

•

Product markets. Sector-specific constraints and thresholds for review under the
Investment Canada Act seem outmoded and may discourage foreign direct
investment. Regulatory reform is also needed in the electricity sector, where
productivity growth has been lower and markups higher than in many other industrial
countries.

•

Trade and agriculture. Canada can play an important leadership role in completing
the Doha Round, particularly by widening market access for agricultural goods,
including those subject to “supply management” schemes.

57.
The financial system appears well placed to support growth. Profitability and
balance sheet positions are favorable, and the system is effectively supervised and regulated.
However, especially in the context of increased global competition for financial services, the
system’s efficiency and resilience could be improved by measures in the following areas:
•

Bank mergers. Greater clarity regarding the public interest criterion would allow a
more transparent examination of potential benefits and costs of merger proposals.

•

Securities regulation. Harmonizing securities regulation would reduce compliance
and administrative costs while simplifying rule making and supervision. We support
the establishment of a national securities regulator, as is typical in most other
industrial countries and was proposed in the report by the Wise Persons’ Committee.

•

Defined benefit pension plans. The funding situation of Canada’s defined benefit
plans—which are largely concentrated in shrinking traditional sectors—appears to
have deteriorated further over the past year. The recent decision to enter into a public

- 31 -

consultation on regulatory reform is welcome and early action is warranted to better
align the incentives of plan sponsors and members to improve funding of the system.
58.

It is recommended that the next consultation occur on the usual 12-month cycle.

SUMMARY AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS OF BACKGROUND WORKING PAPERS
Energy, the Exchange Rate, and the Economy:
Macroeconomic Benefits of Canada's Oil Sands Production
by Tamim Bayoumi and Martin Mühleisen (WP/06/70)
Summary
1.
Canada’s future as an energy-exporting nation increasingly rests on the
development of unconventional oil and gas production. Despite record drilling in the
Western Canada Sedimentary Basin—Canada’s most important source of crude oil and
natural gas—production in that area appears to have reached its peak. However, Canada still
has access to large reserves of coal, and especially coal bed methane gas that, if exploitation
proves commercially feasible, could boost gas production for years to come. In the near term,
it is oil production from Canada’s tar sands that offers the greatest potential for expanding
Canada’s energy exports.
2.
Canada’s tar sands—located mostly in the province of Alberta—are difficult to
exploit but contain one of the largest known hydrocarbon deposits in the world.15
Extracting oil from tar sands requires large amounts of capital and energy, which had made
most of these resources prohibitively expensive to access. However, technological progress
and the tightening of global energy markets have made oil sands production profitable in
many locations. It is estimated that the long-term break-even point for oil sands projects is
currently around US$30–35/bbl, well below most investors’ long-term oil price expectations.
3.
Although investment in the Canadian oil sands is expected to take off sharply, a
sustained increase in production levels requires an adequate supply of skilled labor as well
as additional amounts of electricity, water, diluents, and other critical production inputs.
The demand for natural gas by oil sands operations is expected to roughly double by 2015,
which could contribute to a tightening in the North American gas market and add to the cost
of oil sands production. Finally, notwithstanding considerable improvements in the energy
efficiency of oil sands projects, the anticipated production increase complicates Canada’s
efforts to meet its emissions reduction objectives stated under the Kyoto Protocol.
4.
The recent appreciation of the Canadian dollar has prompted concerns that
Canada’s manufacturing sector could be crowded out by large improvements in the trade
balance. However, a review of the Canadian experience yields few signs that natural
resource exports have persistently hurt the manufacturing sector. Although Canada’s energy
exports have risen steadily relative to GDP since 1980, the real effective exchange rate has
declined over that period, both output and exports of manufacturing goods have been stable
as a ratio to GDP, and the decline in the share of manufacturing employment has been
smaller than in other resource-exporting industrial countries. Short-term fluctuations in
15

Oil sands consist of quartz sand, silt and clay, water, and 10–12 percent bitumen.

manufacturing activity during that period were not correlated with movements in the real
effective exchange rate, which only began to appreciate in 2002. The evidence instead
suggests that conditions in the Canadian manufacturing sector remain largely dependent on
economic developments in the United States, reflected in a strong correlation between U.S.
investment and Canadian goods exports.
5.
Although a close link between nonenergy commodity prices and the value of the
Canadian dollar has been well established in earlier studies, the role of energy prices has
remained less clear. An exchange rate equation therefore relates the Canadian dollar’s value
to energy and nonenergy commodity trade, with a particular focus on changes in the
composition of trade over time.
6.
The results suggest that most of the recent appreciation of the Canadian dollar
against its U.S. counterpart reflects underlying factors. A dynamic projection over 2002Q1
through 2005Q2 leaves only about 5 percentage points of the 30 percent appreciation
unexplained. The estimate of the gap’s size is relatively insensitive to varying the starting
date of the projection.
7.
The model also implies that only a limited exchange rate appreciation would be
expected to result from an increase in oil exports from Alberta’s tar sands. Such production
is expected to add some 1 percent of GDP to net oil exports over 15 years, increasing net oil
exports as a ratio of noncommodity imports by some 4 percentage points. This implies a real
appreciation of only around 4 percent—much less than the implied appreciation since early
2002 although similar to the unexplained gap over that period.
Policy implications
8.
The expansion of oil sands production is likely to have a small impact on the
Canadian economy. The potential gains in export revenues could result in some upward
pressure on the exchange rate, but this is not expected to be large enough to significantly
affect non-energy exporters. The considerable demand for labor and capital inputs from oil
sands exploration and production would spread some of the gains to other provinces and
provide an additional boost to domestic activity. However, even a growing energy sector will
remain only one of several pillars in a well diversified Canadian economy.
9.
Structural polices could assist the development of the oil sands’ production
potential. Most importantly, immigration restrictions could be reviewed with the objective of
providing relief to tight labor supply in some key professions. Moreover, there may be a need
to adapt the regulatory environment for infrastructure development and the environment to
ensure a sustainable production increase in the face of a sharp uptick in investor interest.

Disintermediation and Monetary Transmission in Canada
by Jorge Roldos (WP/06/84)
Summary
10.
The financial system links monetary policy and the real economy. Thus, events or
trends that affect the financial system can also change the monetary transmission mechanism.
Over the last two decades, Canada’s financial system (as well as those in other industrialized
countries) has been transformed by several rounds of financial deregulation, innovation, and
disintermediation. This paper documents these transformations and studies their impact on
the transmission of monetary policy.
11.
Monetary transmission occurs through the impact of interest rates on components
of aggregate demand, and the so-called credit channels—including constraints in the
availability of loanable funds to banks and corporates. Proponents of the credit channel
argue that the traditional channel cannot explain the magnitude, timing, and compositional
effects of the monetary policy actions in the U.S. economy. Credit market frictions give rise
to a “financial accelerator” mechanism that amplifies and makes more persistent the impact
of a monetary policy action on the economy. These credit market frictions depend on several
features of the financial system, in particular the degree of securitization of the financial
system (broadly understood as the development of securities markets versus banks) and the
size and the state of the banking system.
12.
The Canadian financial system has experienced two important changes over the
last two decades as a result of deregulation and
Ratio of Direct to Indirect Private Lending,
financial innovation. First, after dwindling over
1.0
the period of high inflation in the 1970s, the
Canadian financial system has become more
0.8
market-based, as corporates have increased the
use of direct (or market) financing compared to
0.6
indirect (or intermediated) financing. The ratio of
0.4
direct to indirect finance (a measure of financial
disintermediation) for the Canadian corporate
0.2
sector increased steadily since the late 1980’s,
following a series of Bank Act amendments in

1987, 1992 and 1997 (see Figure). Second, there

credit, reflected in a rise in consumer and
mortgage credit.
13.
The paper studies changes in Canada’s monetary policy transmission, associated
with these changes in financial structure, using two methodologies. First, a series of vector
autoregression (VAR) models are used to characterize the dynamics of output and prices
after a monetary shock. Standard VAR models used to study monetary transmission are
extended with the inclusion of financial variables emphasized in the credit channel literature,

ANNEX I

and are tested for the existence of structural breaks or parameter instability around the dates
of major changes in financial sector regulation. Second, the paper studies the impact of
financial variables on structural econometric models of aggregate demand increasingly used
by central banks to conduct monetary policy analysis. In particular, the paper studies the
impact of the ratio of direct to indirect finance on the interest rate sensitivity of aggregate
demand.
14.
The paper suggests that monetary transmission in Canada has changed markedly
since the late 1980’s, and also provides evidence that financial disintermediation has
contributed to these changes. Estimated VAR models show a break in monetary
transmission in 1988, after changes in financial sector regulation initiated the process of
financial disintermediation. Although the inclusion of financial variables in VAR models
improves the characterization of monetary transmission in the period before the structural
break, monetary impulses do not have a statistically significant impact on real activity in the
1990’s. The paper presents evidence that suggests that this may be related to the fact that
VAR models capture the impact of unexpected monetary shocks, while the systematic
component of monetary policy—not captured in the impulse responses—is likely to have
become more important with the improvements in the monetary framework during the
1990’s.
15.
The process of disintermediation has contributed to changes in the sensitivity of
aggregate demand to real interest rates, a key parameter in the transmission of monetary
policy. Estimates of the interest rate elasticity of aggregate demand in IS equations increase
in the 1990’s, confirming the interpretation that the systematic component of monetary
policy has become more relevant in recent years. Moreover, changes in the ratio of direct to
indirect finance contribute to explaining changes in the interest rate elasticity, and suggest an
increased effectiveness of monetary policy associated with a larger use of market-based
sources of finance. This could be attributed to the lower interest rate sensitivity of
relationship-based bank lending compared to the more price-sensitive direct or market
funding.
16.
The increased access to credit by the household sector may change monetary
transmission in other ways not captured in the simple models considered in this paper.
Although the model in the paper suggests that greater credit to the household sector would
lower the impact of interest rates on aggregate demand, it could also increase the role of bank
balance sheets and monetary transmission.
17.
Finally, more market-based financial systems have the additional advantage of
providing more diversification opportunities and greater information on the pricing of
financial risks. These wider economic benefits will help to support financial stability and
economic activity moving forward.

- 42 -

ANNEX I

Policy implications
18.
Changes in financial structure appear to have made monetary policy more effective
in the 1990’s, making it easier to stabilize economic activity. As the impact of interest rate
changes on aggregate demand has increased with financial disintermediation, smaller
changes in rates would be needed to respond to shocks, although this process seems to have
come to a halt since 2002 as financial companies have focused more on household lending.
19.
More effective monetary policy makes it easier to cope with external shocks as a
smaller increase in rates would be needed to stabilize aggregate demand. On the other
hand, lower nominal interest rates and the proximity of the zero bound would caution against
a shorter policy horizon when the likelihood of large shocks increases.
Why Do Canadian Women Work So Much More? An International Perspective
by Evridiki Tsounta (WP/06/92)
Summary
20.
The female labor–force participation rate has received considerable attention in
recent years as a potential source of faster growth and a possible answer to population
aging. A large literature has developed on the impact of policies to facilitate combining work
and family life. Most of these studies are country-specific, however, and deliver varied
results.
21.
While the analysis is cross-country,

benefit wedges, institutional factors and
social norms in explaining female participation rate in Canada.16

16

The sample comprises Australia, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Spain, Sweden, the United
Kingdom, and the United States.

- 43 -

ANNEX I

22.
Econometric analysis suggests that economic factors, together with institutional
factors and preferences, have shaped female participation decisions in Canada and other
industrial countries. Depending on the specification used, we find that the decrease in
secondary earner’s tax wedge, coupled with the increase in childcare benefits since the mid1990s, could help explain 30–80 percent of the increase in Canadian women’s participation
rate between 1995 and 2001. Secondary earner’s tax wedge acts as a disincentive to labor
participation, while childcare benefits encourage women to enter the labor market. A
1 percentage point tax cut would raise female participation rate by 0.17-0.19 percentage
points, while the impact of an equivalent increase in childcare benefits is similar or larger
with estimates ranging from 0.14–0.99 percentage points. These results suggest that higher
tax wedges raise the opportunity cost of working and thus discourage work effort, while
benefits, such as affordable and available childcare, encourage women to enter the labor
force by lowering the opportunity cost of work.
23.
Non-policy variables, such as preferences and institutional factors, are also found
to be important in explaining female participation rate and trends across countries. In
particular:
•

The unemployment rate, which is meant to capture labor market pressures due to
fluctuations in economic activity, dampens female participation, possibly due to the
“discouraged worker” effect.

•

Labor market regulation (e.g., union density, employment protection) has a positive
impact on female participation while high wage compression discourages female
participation since it raises the relative price of childcare.

•

Preferences are found to be important in shaping female participation in the labor
market. The decision to study, captured in years of education enrollment, and the
decision to have children, both act as a disincentive to enter the labor market. The
effect of parental leave on female participation is ambiguous.

•

Cultural characteristics, captured by the role of women in politics and by country
fixed effects, often linked to institutional characteristics, preferences and social norms
not modeled explicitly, are also found to be important in understanding female
participation in the labor market.

Policy implications
24.
The analysis indicates that the reforms in the Canadian tax and benefit system in
the mid-1990s have been successful in boosting female participation rate. This suggests
that policies, similar to the ones initiated in Canada to “reconcile work and family” could be
used by other countries to facilitate greater female labor force participation rates. Policies
that encourage young women to enter the workforce could also have positive long-term
implications, due to their impact on life time participation.
25.
Given the challenges population aging poses for the welfare, pension, and health
systems, raising labor market participation further would be desirable even in Canada. For

- 44 -

ANNEX I

example, Canada’s old-age participation rate is only average by international standards, and
participation of low-income workers is very low. Therefore, the challenge remains to adopt
policies (e.g., lower tax wedges, reforms in the pension system, etc.) to boost participation
rates in these labor market segments.
Shocking Aspects of Canadian Labor Markets
by Tamim Bayoumi, Bennett Sutton, and Andrew Swiston (WP/06/83)
Summary
26.
Labor market flexibility is an important determinant of differences in economic
performance across countries. In particular, greater flexibility of the labor market is
generally regarded as one of the key factors explaining both the greater capacity of the
United States to absorb adverse macroeconomic shocks compared, for example, to the euro
area as well as the significant remaining difference in living standards between these two
regions.17
27.
Canada’s susceptibility to external shocks and highly regionalized economic
structure put an additional premium on economic flexibility, including in labor markets.18
Exchange rate flexibility helps the economy to buffer external disturbances, while its
regional diversity underlines the importance of being able to shift workers within the country.
Focusing on the second topic, this paper examines Canada’s labor mobility from a range of
perspectives, including a comparison of Canada’s labor market dynamics with those of other
countries. In addition, as Canadian Employment Insurance (EI) payments are more generous
and easily accessible in locations where unemployment is high, a particular focus of the
paper is on the degree to which labor mobility appears to differ within Canada, and how it
appears to depend on prevailing regional labor market conditions.
28.
The approach in this paper follows and extends earlier macroeconomic work on
measuring labor adjustment within countries. In particular, a 1992 paper by Blanchard and
Katz analyzed U.S. labor market flexibility using data on employment, unemployment, and
the participation ratio across individual U.S. states. They found that local U.S. labor markets
appeared to adjust relatively rapidly to acyclical shocks, with migration playing a key role in
this process. By contrast, using the same methodology, a 1995 paper by Decressin and Fatas
found that labor adjustment across European regions was less flexible than in the United
States. This paper compares Canada’s responses to those of the United States and three euro
area countries, France, Germany, and Spain, as well as comparing responses across Canadian
regions.
17

Labor market reform, including raising participation rates to boost output, is a key component in the euro
area’s Lisbon structural reform agenda (European Commission, 2005). For estimates of the possible benefits
from such reforms on flexibility and output, see Bayoumi, Laxton, and Pesenti (2004) and Gersbach (2003).
18

Chapter 1 of the Selected Issues paper contains a discussion of regional aspects of the Canadian economy.

- 45 -

ANNEX I

29.
The results suggest that Canada has a relatively flexible labor market by
international standards. In common with the United States, migration plays a significant
role in the adjustment to labor demand shocks. By contrast, this mechanism is much less
important in Spain, France, and Germany. These differences in behavior are robust across a
range of assumptions and appear to be the key to explaining differing levels of flexibility
across countries.
30.
Labor markets within Canada seem to become more flexible as one moves to the
west. Migration plays a much more important role in labor market adjustment in the western
provinces than in the Atlantic ones. Turning to the central provinces of Ontario and Quebec,
the evidence suggests that Ontario has a significantly more flexible labor market than its
neighbor, consistent with microeconomic evidence on migration. Further analysis indicates
that migration appears to be the main process through which labor markets adjust over time,
with real wage differentials being a minor factor. Finally, the adjustment process appears
relatively similar across macroeconomic disturbances. In short, labor adjustment appears
very different east and west of the Ottawa River.
Policy implications
31.
Canada’s relatively flexible labor markets appear relatively well placed to respond
to the recent rise in oil prices. Oil prices tend to support activity in the raw-material rich
west, while the accompanying exchange rate appreciation is likely to affect Ontario, whose
manufacturing base is closely integrated with the United States. These provinces exhibit
relatively flexible labor markets by international standards, facilitating a reasonably smooth
adjustment to shocks.
32.
The flexibility of Canadian labor markets could be further increased by marketoriented reforms of the Employment Insurance system. While the macroeconomic analysis
reported here cannot directly identify the reasons for the observed differences in labor market
flexibility across Canadian regions, both the inter- and intra-national results suggest that the
key difference in labor market flexibility are incentives for migration. Empirical research on
Canada suggests that economic opportunities, cost of migration, age, and language are the
most important determinants of inter-provincial migration. While EI appears to play a more
minor role, eliminating differences in eligibility and benefits across localities would tend to
reduce the differences in labor market flexibility across regions identified in the analysis.

Canada–Financial System Stability Assessment–
Volume II: Report on Observance of Standards
in the Financial System

APPENDIX I

FO/Dis/00/2, Sup. 1,
04/01/00

Summary: The FSSA report concluded that Canada has a stable and highly advanced
financial system, which is among the soundest in the world. Moreover, it is supported
by a well-developed regulatory system that shows a high degree of compliance with
major international standards. Nevertheless, the FSSA report made a few
recommendations to further strengthen the regulatory framework and financial
system’s resilience, most of which have already been addressed, including:
•

Introducing capital requirements for the guarantees in life insurance
segregated fund (completed by end-2001);

•

Tabling legislation granting the Office of the Superintendent of Financial
Institutions (OSFI) powers to remove a financial institution’s director or
senior officer if the person is deemed not suitable to hold that office based on
a number of criteria. The latter legislation brought Canada into broad
compliance with the Basel Core Principles;

•

Making significant progress in harmonizing securities regulation and
improving coordination among provincial securities regulators, including
through a newly created association of securities regulators, the Canadian
Securities Administrators. Although there remain multiple regulators at the
provincial level, a Senate commission was created to develop specific
recommendations on further harmonization and streamlining of securities
regulation.

Canada: Report on the Observance of Standards
and Codes—Fiscal Transparency Module

IMF Country Report
No. 02/51, 03/12/02

Summary: The report found that fiscal management in Canada meets the
requirements of the fiscal transparency code, and in a number of instances represents
best practice. In particular, it highlighted the use of private sector economic forecasts,
prudence factors, and a contingency reserve for fiscal forecasting in Canada. Fiscal
management was also commended for its statistical integrity, impartial tax
administration, open procurement, and a transparent regulatory process.
The report found several areas where further improvements would be desirable,
including: (i) the preparation of timely, current year estimates of federal and
provincial budgets on a comparable basis, (ii) a comprehensive account of the
procedures for the budget cycle and expenditure management system, (iii) systematic
reporting of the use of reserves for non-economic contingencies, (iv) resumption of
publication of reconciled national and public accounts forecasts of major aggregates
over the forecast horizon, and (v) publication by all governments of quasi-fiscal
activities.
Many of these issues have been addressed, including: (i) the release by Statistics
Canada of consolidated data for federal and provincial budgets for 2001–02 (on a

- 48 -

Financial Management System basis), and (ii) the publication of comprehensive
descriptions of budget and expenditure management procedures, including: a joint
document entitled “Budgeting in Canada” by the Government and the OECD;
detailed accounts of policies and procedures on expenditure management at the
website of the Treasury Board Secretariat; and the explanation of the budget cycle
and process in Budget and Update documents.

Summary: Canada’s macroeconomic statistics are comprehensive, timely, and
accurate and thus adequate to conduct effective surveillance of economic and
financial policies. Official institutions responsible for the compilation and
dissemination of the macroeconomic datasets are supported by adequate legal and
institutional frameworks. These frameworks protect confidentiality and ensure that
statistical work is conducted within a quality assurance program and with sufficient
resources. Integrity is ensured by the professionalism of the staff, transparency in
statistical policies and practices, and the provision of ethical guidelines for staff.
Compilers generally follow internationally accepted guidelines in the production of
the macroeconomic statistics, which is well-supported by excellent efforts to develop
source data that facilitate a high degree of accuracy and reliability. Statistics are
generally relevant, well documented, available with good frequency on a timely basis,
and readily accessible to users, who trust them as objective.
While recognizing the high quality of the macroeconomic data, the report makes
recommendations to further strengthen the statistical system, most of which are
already being addressed, including these priorities:
•

Articulate the roles of Statistics Canada and the Bank of Canada in producing
financial sector statistics and explore possibilities for more data sharing of
monetary and financial statistics;

•

Estimate consumption of fixed capital at replacement cost rather than historic
costs now used for the corporate sector in the Canadian System of National
Accounts (CSNA);

•

Disseminate information on the sources and methods used in compiling quarterly
public sector statistics for the quarterly CSNA; and

•

Reclassify certain transactions that are not recorded in line with the 5th edition of
the Balance of Payments Manual (BPM5).

Canada—Statistical Issues
The quality, coverage, periodicity, and timeliness of Canada’s economic data are considered
to be excellent both in the context of the Article IV consultation and for purposes of ongoing
surveillance. Canada has subscribed to the Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard
(SDDS), and its metadata are posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board
(DSBB).
Real Sector. Statistics Canada provides timely and adequate data in monthly, quarterly, and
annual frequency thereby facilitating the analysis of economic developments and assessment
of policy proposals within a quantitative macroeconomic framework. In May 2001, Statistics
Canada effected a smooth transition from Laspeyres methodology for estimating real
expenditure-based GDP to Fisher index formulae, which enabled more accurate comparison
between Canada and other G-7 countries.
Fiscal Sector. The Department of Finance Canada provides monthly and annual data on the
federal government’s budget, tax policies, rules and regulations for Canada’s banks and other
financial institutions. The provided data enable adequate assessment of the impact of fiscal
policy measures on Canada’s economic performance.
Monetary Sector. The Bank of Canada provides timely and adequate coverage of daily,
weekly, monthly and quarterly data related to the monetary sector.
External Sector. Statistics Canada provides timely information on a quarterly frequency on
the balance of payments, external debt, and the international investment position (IIP).
Finance Canada provides monthly data on Official International Reserves in a format
comparable to the IMF’s reserve data template, thus enabling adequate surveillance. Data are

APPENDIX III

Alternative Scenario: The Perfect Storm
Given its high degree of openness, the Canadian economy remains vulnerable to swings in
global economic conditions—particularly in the United States, which absorbs 90 percent of
Canada’s exports. The authorities remain particularly concerned that a disorderly unwinding
of global current account imbalances could have a major impact on Canada, including from a
possible appreciation of its exchange rate and a slowing demand for its export products.
The effects of a such a scenario have been studied in a simulation using the Oxford
Economics Global Macro Model. It has been assumed that a loss of economic confidence
reduces both fixed investment and consumption in the United States by 3 percent relative to
baseline in 2006, with the loss expanding to 5 percent by the end of 2010. As a result of
declining global demand, the price of oil would drop by 30 percent relative to baseline within
two years, and a depreciation of the U.S. currency would be mirrored in a 25 percent
appreciation of the Canadian dollar over the same period.
The results suggest that the Canadian economy could face a deflationary environment,
with GDP falling by over 5 percent relative to baseline over the forecast horizon. The
export sector would be hit hardest, reflecting the sharp exchange rate appreciation,
contributing to a deterioration in the current account balance of more than 6½ percent of
GDP. Although both consumption and investment would benefit from lower interest rates
and reduced prices, growth would on average be 1¼ percentage points lower than in the

would also deteriorate, falling into deficit by 2008.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
CANADA
Staff Report for the 2006 Article IV Consultation
Supplementary Information
Prepared by Western Hemisphere Department
Approved by Christopher Towe
May 19, 2006
1.
This supplement reports on recent economic and policy developments since the
staff report was issued on April 17. In particular, it provides an assessment of the federal
budget for FY2006/07, which was tabled on May 2. The thrust of the staff appraisal remains
unchanged.
Recent economic developments
2.
The Canadian economy continued its
strong performance in the first quarter of 2006 in
line with staff’s expectations. Real GDP grew
0.2 percent in both January and February, bringing
the year-on-year growth rate to 3.3 percent.
Although high commodity prices have provided a
stimulus to the resource-rich Western provinces,
preliminary national accounts data for 2005
suggest that activity also remained strong in much
of the rest of the country, despite the appreciated
exchange rate. Staff continues to project growth at
around 3 percent in both 2006 and 2007.

width of the bars reflects provinces' share in the economy.

3.
The trade balance recorded another strong surplus in March, and the Canadian
dollar reached a 28-year high against the U.S dollar. This largely reflected terms-of-trade
gains and, with the stronger currency, export volumes retreated somewhat from robust levels
recorded in the last quarter of 2005. The Canadian dollar rose above $0.90 in mid-May,
3½ percent above its level in mid-April, reflecting both the broader weakness of the U.S.
currency and recent rises in commodity prices.
4.
Canadian labor market conditions have been robust, productivity growth is now
estimated to have surged in 2005, and inflation pressures have been contained.
Employment growth has averaged a solid 2¼ percent (annualized) during the first four
months of 2006, although the unemployment rate rose slightly to 6.4 percent in April. Recent
data revisions lifted labor productivity growth in the business sector to 2.2 percent in 2005,

5

2
twice the previous estimate and narrowing the productivity growth gap with the United
States to ½ percentage point—the smallest in five years. The 12-month change in the CPI
remained at 2.2 percent in March, while core inflation stayed at 1.7 percent.
Monetary policy
5.
The Bank of Canada raised the target for the overnight rate by ¼ percentage point
to 4 percent on April 25. In the subsequent statement and Monetary Policy Report, the
Bank’s Governing Council noted that the economy had been evolving broadly in line with its
expectations, and suggested diminished concern of a possible disorderly unwinding of global
imbalances. The Council judged that the economy was at or just above capacity and that
some modest further increase in the policy interest rate might be required. The Bank’s
decision was anticipated by the market and in line with staff recommendations.
Fiscal policy
6.
Fiscal policy continues to benefit from buoyant revenue growth. The preliminary
estimate for FY 2005/06 budget outturn suggests a surplus of 0.6 percent of GDP, double the
amount projected in the November 2005 Update. The improvement reflected higher-thanexpected tax revenues across all major categories and unexpected savings on program
spending related to the early dissolution of Parliament in November 2005. The surplus would
have been even higher but for an end-year decision to boost transfers to the provinces and
territories by some ¼ percent of GDP and to commit an additional C$330 million for ODA.
7.
The FY 2006/07 budget contained welcome commitments to reduce public debt,
contain expenditure growth, and lower the tax burden. The new government implemented
many of its economic priorities, including a series of tax cuts aimed at boosting saving and
investment incentives. However, the budget is consistent with the government’s plan to
reduce federal debt by C$3 billion annually. The government also took advantage of the
C$8 billion surplus in FY 2005/06 to advance the previous government’s objective to lower
the debt-to-GDP ratio to 25 percent by one year to FY 2013/14.
8.
The budget’s tax cuts stretch across all major revenue categories. The government
proposed to retain half of a marginal income tax cut introduced by the last government; cut
the GST rate from 7 percent to 6 percent; increase the basic personal income tax exemption
and provide a new C$1,000 employment credit; reduce the general corporate tax rate from
21 percent to 19 percent by 2010; and eliminate the federal capital tax in 2006 and the
corporate surtax in 2008. On the spending side, the budget introduced a new child care
allowance and pledged support to farmers and infrastructure projects. Overall expenditure
growth is to be kept to a “sustainable” pace, including by a budget review aimed at
generating C$1 billion in annual saving.
9.
The new government also suggested that further steps would be taken to strengthen
fiscal transparency. In order to address concern that unbudgeted surpluses were being
allocated inappropriately, the government suggested that a portion of the surplus above the
C$3 billion already committed to debt reduction could be transferred to the Canada and

3
Quebec public pension plans (CPP/QPP), which could provide an opportunity to reduce
payroll taxes over time. In addition, the government plans to establish a Parliamentary
Budget Office, provide quarterly updates of the fiscal outlook, and improve financial
reporting as recommended by the Auditor General.

forward, and as noted in the Staff Report,
the small size of budgetary reserves relative to the uncertainty around Canada’s fiscal
projections will make it especially important to anchor fiscal policies firmly on the mediumterm debt objective.
Structural issues
11.
The budget reaffirmed the government’s commitment to work with provinces and
territories toward a common securities regulator. The budget noted, however, that
provinces and territories had made progress in improving the current system of securities
regulation by narrowing regulatory differences and streamlining the administration of
securities laws.
12.
The budget proposed funding relief for companies sponsoring a defined benefit
pension plan. Measures include consolidating solvency payment schedules and extending
solvency funding payments from 5 to 10 years, subject to a buy-in by plan members and
retirees, or when the difference is secured by a letter of credit. Only plan sponsors whose
payments were up-to-date would be eligible.
13.
Canada has agreed a framework with the United States to settle their long-running
trade dispute over the exports of softwood lumber for now. The framework—which will
remain effective for at least 7 years—returns to Canadian producers all but $1 billion of the
approximately $5 billion in U.S.-collected duties and allows them duty-free access to the
U.S. market as long as prices remain above a benchmark price.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
June 16, 2006

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2006 Article IV Consultation
with Canada
On May 22, 2006, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Canada.1
Background
Canada’s strong macroeconomic framework helped deliver another year of strong economic
performance, with GDP growth remaining close to 3 percent in 2005. High commodity prices
have provided a particular stimulus to the resource-rich western provinces, but preliminary
national accounts data for 2005 also suggest that activity remained strong in much of the rest
of the country, despite the appreciated exchange rate. However, early national accounts data
for 2006 suggest some easing of activity in January/February, with strength in the services
sector having been offset by a dip in manufacturing.
As in previous years, economic activity has been supported by strong final domestic demand,
which expanded 4¼ percent in 2005. Household spending was boosted by asset price
appreciation and outstripped income growth causing the personal saving rate to drop into
negative territory. Business investment maintained a robust pace especially in the second half
of 2005, facilitated by strong corporate earnings, low interest rates, and falling prices of
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
imported capital goods. Stepped-up development of Canada’s natural gas and oil sands
reserves added significantly to investment demand.
Net exports continued to be a drag on economic activity in 2005, subtracting 1½ percentage
points from real GDP. However, buoyed by strong gains in the terms of trade, the current
account balance remained at 2¼ percent of GDP. Largely based on the strength of commodity
prices, the real effective exchange rate appreciated a further 6 percent over the previous year.
In nominal terms, the Canadian dollar has recently appreciated against the U.S. dollar to levels
not seen since the late 1970s.
Canadian labor market conditions and productivity growth have been robust. Employment
growth averaged a solid 2¼ percent (annualized) during the first four months of 2006, although
the unemployment rate rose slightly to 6.4 percent in April. Recent data revisions lifted labor
productivity growth in the business sector to 2.2 percent in 2005, twice the previous estimate
and narrowing the productivity growth gap with the United States to ½ percentage point—the
smallest in five years. At the same time, wage and unit labor cost growth has picked up, with
the latter reaching 3¼ percent (year-on-year) in the fourth quarter of 2005.
Notwithstanding higher energy prices, inflation has remained subdued. Headline CPI inflation
remained well within the Bank of Canada’s 1 to 3 percent target band except in September
2005, when a spike in energy prices in the aftermath of hurricane Katrina caused a temporary
overshoot. Core inflation has stayed below 2 percent since early 2004, with the strong
currency and global competition keeping prices of imported goods low, and well-anchored
inflation expectations helping to contain the spillover of energy price shocks into other prices.
After pausing for almost a year, the Bank of Canada resumed withdrawing monetary stimulus
in September 2005. Reflecting the assessment that the economy was operating near capacity,
the Bank has since raised its target for the overnight interest rate to 4 percent in six
consecutive ¼ percentage point steps. In its April statement, the Bank observed that global
competition and the past appreciation of the Canadian dollar continued to pose challenges for
a number of sectors but judged the economy to be operating at, or just above, its production
capacity. Against this background, it noted that some modest further increase in the policy
interest rate might be required.
The FY 2006/07 budget contained welcome commitments to reduce public debt, contain
expenditure growth, and lower the tax burden, including through a number of tax cuts aimed at
boosting incentives for work, saving, and investment. At the same time, the budget included an
explicit commitment to reduce federal debt by C$3 billion annually. The government also took
advantage of the C$8 billion surplus in FY 2005/06 (the ninth consecutive federal budget
surplus) to advance the earlier objective to lower the debt-to-GDP ratio to 25 percent by one
year to FY 2013/14.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors commended Canada’s enviable macroeconomic and policy performance since the
mid-1990s, reflecting the benefits of firm commitments to debt reduction and to an inflation

3
target. They noted that, while high commodity prices have benefited the resource-rich western
provinces in particular, activity has remained strong in much of the rest of the country despite
the appreciated exchange rate, which owes much to the economy's flexibility and regional
diversity.
Directors agreed that the near-term macroeconomic outlook appears broadly favorable.
Growth is likely to remain around most estimates of Canada’s potential growth rate through
2007, in part reflecting the support that continued high commodity prices are likely to provide
to incomes and domestic demand. However, Directors noted that the outlook is subject to
risks, including from the potential for a rapid adjustment of global imbalances and the low
household saving rate. Against this background, and in the light of the increased intensity of
global competition in goods and services and for investment and given the coming retirement
of the baby boom generation, Directors agreed on the importance of maintaining prudent fiscal
and monetary policies and further improving the economy’s flexibility.
Directors commended the Bank of Canada for continuing carefully to withdraw monetary
stimulus in recent months. Further modest increases in the overnight interest rate will likely be
required to bring headline inflation back to target, although the Bank’s credible commitment to
price stability provides scope to respond flexibly to macroeconomic developments. In
particular, with the economy operating near its potential, Directors suggested that the support
to activity from favorable terms of trade will need to be balanced against the drag from an
appreciated exchange rate, whose strength continues to largely reflect fundamentals, including
high commodity prices.
Directors considered that Canada’s inflation targeting framework has been successful in
keeping inflation and inflation expectations low, and that there is no need for significant
amendments to it. They welcomed the Bank of Canada’s commendable record of
transparency.
Directors welcomed the new government’s commitment to lowering the tax burden,
maintaining fiscal surpluses, and continuing debt reduction. The emphasis on limiting the
growth of government spending is appropriate, and the planned reductions in corporate rates
and the early elimination of the federal capital tax are warranted given the relatively high level
of Canada’s marginal effective corporate tax rates. Most Directors considered that reducing
marginal personal income tax rates and promoting tax-deferred saving would have provided
greater incentives to save and invest than cutting the goods and services tax (GST) rate.
Some Directors cautioned that the large number of tax deductions and credits proposed in the
budget could increase the complexity of the tax code.
Directors supported the new government’s prudent fiscal framework, which has benefited from
steps to strengthen fiscal transparency, the decision to pay down federal debt by C$3 billion a
year, and the advancement by one year of the objective of lowering the federal debt-to-GDP
ratio to 25 percent. Directors agreed that the establishment of a Parliamentary Budget Officer
and the medium-term debt anchor could help support the social consensus for prudent fiscal
policies.

4
Directors called attention to the fiscal challenges to all levels of government arising from the
rapid increase in provincial and territorial outlays on health care. Some Directors observed that
allowing provinces greater flexibility in using price and other market-based mechanisms could
help to align better the demand for and supply of health care. Directors welcomed the
forthcoming review of the system of federal equalization payments to provinces, while
underscoring the importance of ensuring that regional disparities in fiscal capacity are not
exacerbated due to the boom in oil and gas prices.
Directors agreed that the financial system is well placed to support economic growth, but
called for further improvement in the system’s efficiency and resilience to better confront the
increased global competition for financial services. In this respect, Directors welcomed the
upcoming regular review of federal financial sector legislation as well as Canada's agreement
in principle to undertake an FSAP in 2007 or shortly thereafter. Greater clarity regarding the
new government’s bank merger policy would allow a more transparent examination of potential
benefits and costs of merger proposals. Directors welcomed the provinces’ efforts toward the
harmonization of securities regulation, and the federal government’s intention to pursue a
common securities regulator as a more effective approach. Directors supported measures to
improve the funding situation of defined benefit pension plans.
Directors observed that, although Canada has been among the fastest growing industrial
countries in recent years, there is scope to boost productivity through labor and product market
reform. They emphasized the desirability of continuing to reduce welfare walls to improve labor
participation among low-income groups, amending the immigration process to help address
skills shortages, and simplifying the recognition of occupational qualifications across
provinces. Consideration could also be given to funding the Employment Insurance system’s
social benefits through general revenues, rather than the payroll tax, and to curbing extended
regional benefits to boost employment and economic efficiency.
Directors suggested that sector-specific constraints and thresholds for review under the
Investment Canada Act seem outmoded and may discourage foreign direct investment. They
advocated regulatory reform in the electricity sector, where productivity growth has been lower
and markups higher than in many other industrial countries. Directors urged Canada to work to
widen access to its markets for agricultural goods, including those subject to supply
management schemes.
Directors commended the authorities for their commitment to double Canada’s International
Assistance Envelope by the end of the decade.
