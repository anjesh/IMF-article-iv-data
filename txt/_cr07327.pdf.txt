Discussions took place in Kinshasa May 23–June 7. The staff team comprised
Messrs. Briançon (head), Maret (Res. Rep.), Ben Ltaifa, Hartley, Farah (all AFR),
Féler (PDR), and Westphal (FAD). Mr. Ames, who is to succeed Mr. Briançon, joined the
mission on June 2, 2007. Mr. N’Sonde, office of the Executive Director, participated in
policy meetings.

The last Article IV consultation was concluded on August 29, 2005. The last Poverty
Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement expired at end-March 2006; the sixth
review was not completed because of policy and reform slippages.

•

On June 18, 2007, the Board discussed the 2007 Staff Monitored Program (SMP). It
expressed deep concern about the risk to the fiscal framework and macroeconomic stability of
an expansionary budget. It also urged faster implementation of structural reforms.

•

The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) reached the decision point under the enhanced
Heavily Indebted and Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative in July 2003. At the completion point
it will receive HIPC debt relief and relief under the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative
(MDRI) of more than US$7 billion in NPV terms. Reaching the completion point would
require a successful first review of a new PRGF arrangement, one year implementation of the
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) and the observance of the agreed triggers.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The DRC has made significant economic and political progress since 2001, after years
of turmoil. Rapid disinflation helped restore economic confidence and renew growth. The
economy is now relatively open, and fiscal and monetary policies have become more
effective. Democratic elections in 2006 marked the end of political transition.
The good economic performance proved difficult to sustain. Starting in 2005—and
coinciding with the election cycle—fiscal loosening led to the re-emergence of inflation and
a reduction of international reserves to low levels. Structural reforms also slowed.
The new government’s reassertion of fiscal discipline in early 2007 is threatened by an
expansionary budget. The 2007 budget contains unrealistic revenue projections and
concomitant higher spending, especially on wages. Execution of such a budget would widen
the deficit, expand the monetary base, and prompt a new inflationary cycle. The government
is assessing how to implement the budget and maintain macroeconomic stability.
Achieving high and sustained economic growth requires the stepping up of structural
reforms. Over the medium term, economic growth is likely to benefit from a pick-up in
mining and increased public investment. Nevertheless, sustaining high growth will require
reforms to enhance economic governance, improve the business climate, and deepen
financial intermediation. Fighting corruption will be important for mobilizing donor support.
Tax and public financial management reforms are critical for supporting sustainable
growth and making progress toward the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). On
the revenue side, priorities are to reform tax-collection agencies, streamline the tax system,
and boost the contribution of the mining sector. On the expenditure side, civil service reform
and strengthened controls are needed to direct spending to priority areas. Devolution of
revenues, as called for under the constitution, should be phased in, with assistance from the
World Bank, to avoid loss of fiscal discipline and inequities among provinces.
Monetary policy will focus on establishing single-digit inflation in a floating exchange
rate regime. Financial sector deepening requires strengthening the operations of the central
bank and improvements in supervision to reduce bank sector vulnerabilities.
The exchange rate seems appropriate for external sustainability assuming aid flows,
debt relief and prudent macroeconomic policies.
A tenuous security situation, adverse terms of trade shocks, and incoherent policies
could undermine sustainability and the reform agenda. The new government could
mitigate some of the risks by quickly gaining credibility for good economic management.
Building broad political support for its economic agenda, including passing a revised budget
that conveys a message of macroeconomic moderation, will be key in this regard.
The DRC’s external debt is unsustainable. Along with prudent macroeconomic policies,
relief from the HIPC Initiative and MDRI will be needed to make it sustainable.

4
I. BACKGROUND
1.
The DRC, one of the poorest countries in the world, is still very far from meeting
the MDGs. Over years of conflict, civil war, and poor economic management, per capita
income (in constant 2000 US Dollars) collapsed from US$400 in 1960 to less than US$100
in 2001. As a result, the DRC ranks 166th out of 177 countries in the 2006 UN Human
Development Index.
2.
The DRC is entering a new era after the first democratic elections in 40 years in
2006 ended three years of political transition. The new government has an opportunity to
demonstrate its commitment to economic stability and reform, which would set the stage for
the DRC to sustain growth and reduce poverty. However, the tenuous security situation, as
demonstrated by continued violence in the eastern provinces, still threatens peace and
economic progress.
II. THE PRGF ARRANGEMENT: LESSONS AND CHALLENGES
3.
The PRGF-supported program (2002–06) was designed to entrench
macroeconomic stability, revive growth, and reduce poverty. Given the dire initial
political and security conditions, the consensus was that the DRC could not attain the MDGs
by 2015. The PRGF-supported program thus defined more realistic targets, including
(i) achieving average annual real GDP growth of 5 percent: (ii) reducing inflation to
5 percent; and (iii) increasing international reserves to 10 weeks of imports. Financial
policies were anchored on adherence to monthly budget cash-flow plans to avoid bank
financing of the fiscal deficit and undermining the ability of the Banque Centrale du
Congo (BCC) to conduct prudent monetary policy within a floating exchange rate system.
4.
Economic performance improved markedly during 2002–04 as the transitional
government focused on

(5.4 weeks of imports).

5.
In 2005, program implementation began to weaken, as focus turned to the
drafting of a new constitution and the preparation for general elections. This precluded
completion of the last PRGF review; the arrangement expired in March 2006. Large
monetized public spending overruns, primarily for security and the elections, continued
under a 2006 SMP and into the beginning of 2007 when a new government was installed
(Figures 2 and 3). Consequently, in 2006, the Congo franc depreciated by 15 percent against
the US dollar, 12-month inflation rose to 18.2 percent, and gross international reserves
declined to US$155 million (3 weeks of imports) even though the DRC did not service
US$58 million in debt to official creditors. Real GDP growth, which had picked up to
6½ percent in 2004–05, slipped back to 5 percent in 2006 because of stagnating
manufacturing production and a drop in diamond exports. Little progress was made in
reforming the mining sector, public enterprises, the civil service, the social sectors, customs
administration, and the central bank.

Recent slippages apart, there is no doubt that the situation of the DRC has
improved remarkably since 2001. The program provided a framework for the country to
start rebuilding the economy, which is crucial to lasting peace and security. In particular,
rapid disinflation proved vital to restoring economic confidence and encouraging trade and
private sector activity. The economy is now relatively open, major price distortions have
been removed, the exchange rate is floating, the private sector is the driving force behind
growth, and fiscal and monetary policies have become more effective.
7.
However, the experience of 2002–06 suggests that achieving durable
macroeconomic stability and high growth will be an arduous process with unavoidable
setbacks. Very weak implementing capacity and poor governance put a strain on the focus
and quality of policies (Figure 4). Although the international community provided
considerable technical and financial support, endemic corruption is testing donor relations
and must be addressed if vital support is to be forthcoming. Rebuilding infrastructure also

7
demands increasing attention if the population is to have more opportunity to participate in
the economy. Freeing up resources spent on security and building political institutions is
important in this regard. Effectively mobilizing the DRC’s vast natural resource wealth—
governance problems have been particularly rife in the mining sector—will also be essential.

III. MACROECONOMIC FRAMEWORK FOR 2007
8.
With a view to stabilizing the economy and giving the new government time to
craft its medium-term strategy, staff and the authorities agreed on a SMP for 2007.1 The
program is intended to reduce inflation to 12 percent by year-end, stabilize international
reserves, and increase real GDP growth to 6½ percent—boosted by a recovery in mining and
manufacturing, and supported by public and private investment (Table 1).
9.
Avoiding money-financing of government expenditure requires increasing the
underlying fiscal surplus by 0.9 percentage point of GDP to 1.3 percent (Tables 2 and 3).
It assumes that government revenue is kept at 13¼ percent of GDP in 2007 by increasing the
turnover tax rate from 13 to 15 percent, adjusting nominal fees and duties, and reinforcing

8
tax administration. To contain spending, the government is to keep the wage bill at
5.5 percent of GDP and limit spending to revenue collected.
10.
The first results of the 2007 program were encouraging. Strong revenue collection
and lower than anticipated spending on goods and services reduced net bank credit to the
government (Tables 4 and 5). This contributed to a decline in base money, a fall in
commercial banks’ excess reserves, an appreciation of the Congo franc of 12 percent in the
three months to May 2007, and a decline in annualized inflation to 12 percent in April-May.
International reserves also increased to US$190 million at end-May, partly because the DRC
did not service debt due to Paris Club creditors amounting to US$52 million. Preliminary
data are consistent with the projected real GDP growth rate of 6.5 percent.
11.
However, the 2007 budget promulgated in July threatens progress. It contains
unrealistic revenue projections—4½ percent of GDP higher than the draft budget submitted
by government—that are not supported by specific tax measures, and total budget
appropriations were increased by 3½ percent of GDP—including 1½ percent of GDP for
wages, nearly half of which is for large pay increases for parliamentarians. Execution of
budgeted spending would lead to a new round of currency depreciation and inflation.
12.
Structural reforms are also moving slowly. On program structural benchmarks, the
government has just started publishing joint venture contracts signed by public enterprises on
the website of the Ministry of Finance; it rejected the first draft of the audit of the central
bank’s organization prepared by foreign consultants, because it did not meet the terms of
reference; and discussions continue on a plan to limit the cost of the merger of the Union des
Banques Congolaises and Banques Congolaise to that envisaged under the SMP.
IV. POLICY DISCUSSIONS AND THE MEDIUM-TERM POLICY FRAMEWORK
13.
The discussions focused on three medium-term challenges the DRC faces:
(i) growth and poverty alleviation; (ii) the fiscal strategy; and (iii) financial sector
development. The government indicated that its medium-term strategy incorporates policies
included in the 2006 PRSP. However, it had not yet had time to prepare a detailed
macroeconomic framework taking all priorities into account. Nevertheless, it was made clear
that the government saw fiscal tightening, economic reforms, and improved governance as
crucial steps to build the economy and regain international support.
A. Medium-Term Growth and Poverty Alleviation
14.
The mission emphasized that the DRC can achieve high economic growth by
stepping up structural reforms and improving governance. This would allow the DRC to
break out of its current constrained path where fiscal space is limited by low revenues and a
lack of external financing and private sector activity is inhibited by a poor business climate.

9
15.
An illustrative baseline scenario predicated on the aggressive resumption of
reforms and increased donor financing for development, projects annual real GDP
growth of 8 percent through 2012 (see Text Table).2 It assumes successful execution of the
agreed 2007 program, agreement on a new PRGF arrangement, and reaching soon the HIPC
completion point.3 Medium-term growth would be led by a rebound in mining output and a
pick-up in the reconstruction effort. While the growth rate is ambitious, improvements in the
sociopolitical situation and high commodity prices have sparked investor interest in the
mining sector, which holds a large share of world reserves. The authorities estimate that total
investments in copper and cobalt projects could reach US$3 billion through 2012, allowing
output to return to levels not recorded since the 1980s and contributing about 2.0 percentage
points a year to GDP growth (Figure 5). Concomitantly, an ambitious program—within a
budget that is consistent with macroeconomic stability—to rebuild infrastructure would boost
activity in construction and public works, water and electricity, transport, and
telecommunications. This would require measures to boost revenue and better spending
prioritization.
16.
Initially, the increase in public and private investment is expected to be financed
largely through foreign savings. A surge in imports would lead to a widening external
current account deficit, although that would begin to reverse as mining exports come on
stream. New mines will be mostly financed by foreign direct investment, while increasing
donor support and debt relief would be needed to fill the remaining current account gap and
rebuild international reserves to about 9 weeks of imports.
17.
The authorities recognized that improving the business environment is critical to
private sector–led growth. Aware that the World Bank study on Doing Business in 2007
ranks the DRC at the bottom in terms of ease of starting a business, they plan to accelerate
reforms to meet requirements of the Organization for the Harmonization in Africa of
Business Law, streamline regulations, eliminate numerous nuisance taxes, strengthen the
judicial system, rebuild a multimodal transportation system, and create a forum for dialogue
with the private sector and social partners.
18.
The authorities agreed that government divestiture from public enterprises is
urgently needed. Most public enterprises are close to bankruptcy. Starting with the
electricity company, the national railroad, the state transport company, and the water
company, the government strategy is first to privatize management and then form joint
ventures with domestic and foreign investors. In view of the problems faced by joint ventures
in mining and other sectors, staff encouraged the authorities to assess, with World Bank
assistance, the impact of joint ventures on the economy before proceeding with new ones.
The authorities should also resubmit to the new National Assembly the draft laws related to

For illustrative purpose, the baseline scenario assumes that the DRC would reach the HIPC completion point
and receive full debt relief under the HIPC Initiative and MDRI in June 2008.

19.
Implementing the government’s governance compact will be vital to the high–
growth scenario. The priorities are to improve and make more transparent the management
of mining resources; strengthen tax collection; enhance budget preparation and execution;
implement the civil service reform; and meet requirements for the AML/CFT and the
Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). The staff welcomed the adoption of
legislation to intensify the fight against corruption, money laundering, and the financing of
terrorism, but urged the authorities to take all necessary measures to make the laws effective.

A simplified low-income country external debt sustainability analysis (LIC-DSA)
confirms that the DRC external debt is unsustainable without debt relief under the
enhanced HIPC and MDRI initiatives (DSA Appendix). Assuming DRC reaches the HIPC
completion point by June 2008,4 full relief would allow the NPV of debt to fall and remain
4

The status of execution of HIPC triggers is provided in Table 8.

12
durably below the threshold of 150 percent of exports of goods and services—though the
outcome would be vulnerable to significant exogenous shocks. This argues in favor of an
external financing strategy that relies mainly on grants and to a lesser extent on highly
concessional debt.
21.
Achieving the medium-term objectives will, however, be a challenge. Beyond the
fragile security and political situation, risks include; (i) a sharp deterioration in the terms of
trade; (ii) slower than expected private-sector-led growth; (iii) lower-than-expected donor
support if governance does not improve sufficiently; (iv) slow progress in structural reforms,
possibly due to limited implementation capacity; and (v) fiscal slippages that would
undermine the still fragile macroeconomic situation. The new government now has a window
of opportunity to mitigate some of the risks and gain credibility for prudent macroeconomic
management and reforms. Building broad political support for its economic agenda, and
passing a revised budget that conveys a message of macroeconomic moderation would be
crucial steps in this regard.
22.
An alternative scenario illustrates some of these risks. It assumes persistent
corruption hinders revenue collection, recurrent spending slippage fuels renewed cycles of
inflation and exchange rate volatility, and slow progress in improving the business
environment makes private sector activity uneven. Untied donor support would also be
limited while lower international reserves would limit central bank ability to smooth out
shocks. As a result, real GDP growth would average 4-5 percent and inflation exceed
20 percent. Progress in reducing poverty would be minimal (Table 7). New arrears would
accumulate on external debt service.
B. Medium-Term Fiscal Strategy
23.
Discussions on the fiscal strategy centered on reconciling a sustainable fiscal
stance with the need for large capital and social expenditures. The authorities concurred
that, to create the needed fiscal space, the medium-term framework should aim to
(i) streamline the tax system and broaden the tax base; (ii) improve tax collection;
(iii) improve public financial management (PFM); and (iv) enhance the efficiency of
government spending.
24.
While recognizing the need to improve revenue collection, the authorities were
reluctant to embrace a comprehensive reform strategy for collection agencies. Staff
argued that strengthening the large taxpayer unit (LTU)—including by increasing the number
of the covered enterprises—and merging the tax administration with the non-tax-collection
agency (DGRAD) will enhance accountability, reduce leakage, and bring in more revenue.
Similarly, for customs it will be essential to eliminate the interference of the quality control
office and other public agencies at the one-stop customs window at the main port of entry,
Matadi, and set up similar structures at other customs points. While sanguine about the
prospects for making the revenue collection agencies more effective, the authorities were

13
concerned about the sociopolitical risk of far-reaching organizational changes. They were
more amenable to the staff proposal to replace the generous bonus system for the revenue
collection agencies with clearly defined budget allocations.
25.
The authorities concurred that tax administration reform will need to be
complemented by tax policy reforms. They therefore requested a tax policy mission to
review the scope for reducing nuisance taxes (the DRC has currently more than 800 taxes,
duties and fees), limiting tax exemptions; and assessing preparations for introducing a value–
added tax (VAT). Staff urged the authorities to submit the draft VAT law to Parliament as
soon as possible and provide sufficient budgetary resources for necessary investments in tax
administration.
26.
Increasing the tax take from mining—including by fighting corruption—is
paramount for both mobilizing revenue. Prospects for new mining projects suggest
considerable potential for increasing mining revenue. Staff emphasized, however, that the
current fragmented tax administration and responsibility for collecting mining revenue could
jeopardize collections. In particular, because the customs administration has no incentive to
monitor exports, the agency in charge of collecting royalties is poorly placed to assess
whether mining company self-assessments of export values are appropriate. Moreover, staff
proposed the reinforcement of tax administration in the mining sector by improving
communication between collection agencies and creating a specialized unit within the LTU
to collect mining royalties, licenses fees, and other nontax revenue currently collected by the
DGRAD. The authorities felt that they need more time to assess the way forward.
27.
Better prioritizing of expenditures and PFM reforms are crucial. Staff argued for
an institutional framework for expenditure prioritization, whereby public investment projects
and spending programs selected are those with the highest rate of social return. In this
context, the authorities were sympathetic to protecting priority spending (especially health
and education) from the volatility of foreign financing and improving expenditure
execution—especially with social spending currently well below PRSP targets. Staff
emphasized that PFM reforms must be accelerated to improve further the tracking of
spending to ensure its consistency with budget objectives. This could stimulate aid flows by
alleviating donor concerns about a lack of transparency in government spending. Finally,
better expenditure control will require civil service reform and firmer payroll management to
contain the wage bill and allow for a more progressive wage structure.
28.
The authorities are well aware of the risks to economic and financial stability
from devolution but face political pressure to move rapidly. Although implementing laws
and regulations are still being discussed,5 elected provincial assemblies and governors have
demanded that 40 percent of government revenue generated in a province be transferred—as
5

The World Bank is assisting the authorities in this regard.

14
provided under the constitution—as early as this year. Staff argued for a gradual transfer in
line with the devolution of spending responsibilities, taking into consideration capacity at the
provincial level. It warned that automatic transfer carries the potential for imbalances and
inequities among provinces, especially since the revenue collected by several provinces is
below 1 percent of the total. Staff also argued for (i) excluding custom duties as well as oil
and mining revenues from the base for deriving the 40 percent to be transferred to provinces;
(ii) including in the revenue transfer formula an equalization component based on transparent
and objective criteria; and (iii) prohibiting borrowing by provinces. While concurring in
principle, the authorities were concerned that the politics might preclude such solutions.
C. Monetary Policy and Banking Sector Reform
29.
The authorities plan to refocus monetary policy on bringing inflation down to
single digits and building up international reserves. They pointed out that this was not
possible in recent years because monetization of the fiscal deficit made it difficult to contain
base money growth. With high dollarization, rapid monetary expansion translated almost
immediately into a depreciation of the currency and high inflation, especially since many
local prices and wages are pegged to the U.S. dollar.
30.
Notwithstanding volatility, staff argued that base money should be the nominal
anchor against the backdrop of a floating exchange rate. The latter was appropriate given
that the BCC has minimal international reserves and the economy is relatively open and
vulnerable to terms of trade shocks. The BCC should continue letting the market determine
the exchange rate and interventions be limited to increasing the market’s liquidity, smoothing
out short-term exogenous shocks, and achieving the BCC’s international reserve target. To
do this effectively, the BCC must acquire a better understanding of how the market operates
and the factors influencing commercial banks participation. Staff also urged the authorities to
quickly lift the remaining exchange restriction and multiple currency practice.
31.
In light of this, and despite difficulties in assessing the equilibrium exchange rate
in a post–conflict situation, the exchange rate seems appropriate for external
sustainability assuming continued aid flows, debt relief and prudent macroeconomic
policies. Staff noted, and the authorities agreed, that over the medium term, large capital
inflows related to public and private investments could put upward pressure on the real
exchange rate (Figure 6). Effects on competitiveness should be defrayed by rebuilding
infrastructure, improving governance, and reducing the cost of doing business.

The BCC needs to implement reforms to improve financial transactions, restore
its independence, and enhance the credibility of the Congo franc. It is preparing to issue
higher-denomination notes—currently, the highest face value is equivalent to US$1—to
increase the use of the Congolese franc in transactions. The BCC also plans to formulate an
efficient national payment system with World Bank assistance. Finally, since seignorage is
limited, the BCC agreed that it must concentrate on its core functions—including improving
its role as cashier of the government—and thoroughly reorganize itself to reduce its recurrent
operating losses—0.5 percent of GDP in 2006. These reforms will also help the BCC regain
its autonomy.
33.
Improving banking supervision and addressing commercial bank vulnerabilities
would improve confidence in the financial sector and deepen financial intermediation.
The DRC financial sector development indicators compare unfavorably with other SubSaharan African countries (see Text Tables). The BCC agreed that its priorities should
include (i) completing the restructuring of banks started in 1998 and raising the minimum
capital requirement, (ii) enhancing competition by granting licenses to new banks that have a
reference shareholder, (iii) strengthening on-site supervision, (iv) reinforcing compliance
with prudential ratios; and (v) bringing regulation into line with international standards. To
ensure sound development of the microfinance sector, the BCC is compiling a
comprehensive database and is drafting a law for the sector to be submitted to parliament
next year.

D. Statistical Issues
34.
The economic database is largely adequate for surveillance and program
monitoring, but needs substantial improvement . The CPI should be expanded beyond
Kinshasa and Lubumbashi and reflect changes in the consumption basket since 1987. The
quality and timeliness of national accounts, balance of payments, and government finance
statistics need upgrading. The authorities are working with development partners, including
the Fund, to reinforce economic statistics. A review of the national accounts—which is likely
to substantially increase nominal GDP—is underway.

17
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
35.
Despite remarkable progress, stronger and more consistent policies and reforms
are needed to put the DRC on a rapid development path. Policy slippage over the last two
years led to sharp fluctuations in the exchange rate and high inflation, while the
implementation of structural reforms was limited. With the elections successfully over,
policy makers need to shift gears to reassert macroeconomic stability, jump start reforms, and
improve governance. This will require strong leadership and a skilled economic team to build
a broad consensus on the direction of economic policies, overcome entrenched interests and
combat corruption. The authorities need to craft as a matter of urgency an ambitious and
coherent medium-term macroeconomic framework that reflects the priorities in the PRSP.
36.
Adequate and timely foreign assistance is essential to the successful
implementation of the government strategy. This will support rebuilding infrastructure and
key social services, especially primary health, education and strengthening institutions.
Reduced corruption and willingness to reform will help create a virtuous cycle of growth and
donor support.
37.
A high rate of economic growth can be achieved in the medium term, but there
are downside risks. A recovery in mining output and the rehabilitation of infrastructure are
expected to be drivers of growth. The DRC is vulnerable to commodity price swings and
lower donor support. Political inaction in the context of a fragmented coalition and the tense
security situation, especially in the eastern provinces, pose significant risk. Some risks can be
lowered by focusing immediately on macroeconomic stability, building reserves, and making
the economy more resilient by removing obstacles to private sector development.
38.
Although recent SMP performance in the fiscal area has been encouraging, the
2007 budget represents a serious danger for macroeconomic stability. Because the
revenue projections in the 2007 budget are unrealistic, the execution of proposed spending
would almost certainly result in monetization of a large fiscal deficit and a new round of
currency depreciation and high inflation. The proposed inflation of the wage bill is neither
affordable nor justified. Spending based on a monthly cash flow plan should be limited to
revenue collected. Further, the authorities should proceed as a matter of urgency with a
supplementary budget in line with the SMP.
39.
Improving public financial management is paramount to enhancing the
efficiency and credibility of the budget process. This means strengthening revenue
collection, rationalizing spending procedures, and improving the tracking of poverty-related
expenditure. Civil service reform and better payroll management will also be essential to
contain the wage bill.
40.
Devolution should proceed cautiously to preserve the integrity of the budget. The
transfer of budget resources to provinces needs to be accompanied by a commensurate
transfer of responsibilities. To avoid undermining fiscal discipline, it should be preceded by a
strong push to build local capacity and control mechanisms. A mechanism to ensure a degree
of equity among provinces is also needed.

18
41.
A tight monetary policy stance is critical to bringing inflation down. To make
monetary policy more effective, it is essential that the BCC enhance monetary policy
instruments and international reserve management by implementing recommendations from
Fund technical assistance. At the same time, to make monetary policy more credible, the
central bank needs to improve the transparency of its operations, including its accounts.
42.
Staff views the exchange rate as broadly appropriate for external sustainability,
provided that prudent macroeconomic policies are implemented and aid flows and debt relief
are forthcoming. So, intervention in the foreign exchange market should largely be restricted
to short-term smoothing operations.
43.
Priority should be given to implementing the governance compact and giving
renewed impetus to structural reforms, starting with addressing delays in mining sector
and public enterprise reforms, accelerating adherence to the Extractive Industries
Transparency Initiative, and reforming the social sectors and judiciary. Legislation to
intensify the fight against corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism is a
welcome start. All efforts should be made to implement the new laws effectively.
44.
Debt sustainability hinges on debt relief. It is thus crucial for the government to
comply with all trigger measures so that the DRC can reach the HIPC completion point
without undue delays. Prudent debt management is also important. In the meantime, it is
essential for the central bank to build up its reserves so that it can service lumpy debt
payments. Staff does not recommend approval of the existing exchange restrictions and
encourages the authorities to remove these restrictions as soon as possible.
45.

It is proposed that the DRC remain on the standard 12-month consultation cycle.

Reflects revised calculation of HIPC Initiative assistance from 2002-based Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA).
For 2004 and 2005, program figures reflect a change in classification of retirement allowances as part of exceptional spending.
For 2005, interest payments include rescheduling agreements with commercial creditors under the enhanced HIPC Initiative.

4

Exceptional expenditure includes spending for the Demobilization, Disarmament, and Reintegration (DDR) program, cost of the elections, payments for retirement allowances, repayments of
domestic arrears, and payment for bank restructuring.

5

For 2005, HIPC Initiative savings used for pro-poor wages and domestic investment were recorded under wages and domestic-financed investment.
Internal and external arrears.

7

Underlying fiscal balance is defined as revenue minus expenditure and excluding interest on foreign debt, foreign-financed capital expenditure, all exceptional spending, and repayment of
domestic arrears. Difference between estimated figure for 2005 and one reported in IMF Country Report No. 05/374 reflects the change in definition to exclude all exceptional spending.

Table 8. Democratic Republic of the Congo: Progress Status of Triggers for Reaching the
Floating Completion Point under the HIPC Initiative

(As of June 2007)
Triggers

Progress status

1. PRSP
Completion of a full PRSP through
a participatory process and its
implementation for one year, duly
documented in the DRC’s annual
progress report, and confirmed as
satisfactory by a joint staff advisory
note (JSAN).

Ongoing. The full PRSP was completed through a
participatory process, and was adopted by the government in
July 2006. The PRSP and the JSAN were submitted to the
Fund and World Bank Boards in April 2007. The document is
being disseminated. The implementation plan for the strategy
was endorsed by sectoral ministries, NGOs, and civil society.
A priority action program (PAP) 2007–08 was developed in
collaboration with development partners and sectoral
ministers, to start implementing the PRSP.

2. Macroeconomic stability
Continued maintenance of
macroeconomic stability after
reaching the decision point, as
evidenced by satisfactory performance
under a program supported by an
arrangement under the IMF’s PRGF.

Underperforming. Macroeconomic stability deteriorated
during the period leading up to and after the elections. The
PRGF arrangement expired in March 2006 before the
completion of the final review. Under a program for 2006
monitored by Fund staff (SMP), key quantitative and
structural performance indicators for end-September and endDecember were missed. In particular, the government ran a
larger than planned budget deficit, which was moneyfinanced. As a result, inflation outpaced the program target,
and the Congo franc weakened. Under a SMP for 2007, the
new government has tightened macroeconomic policies,
leading to a decline of inflation and appreciation of the
Congolese franc since March 2007. However, fiscal
discipline is at risk following the promulgation in July of an
expansionary budget for 2007.

3. Use of budgetary savings resulting
from enhanced HIPC Initiative-related
debt service relief during the interim
period for poverty-related
expenditures in accordance with the IPRSP, with supporting documentation
satisfactory to the staffs of IDA and
the IMF.

Ongoing. The use of budgetary savings from the enhanced
HIPC Initiative is aligned with the priorities expressed in IPRSP and PRSP. The government continues its efforts to use
HIPC savings to finance spending in the areas of health and
education. These social sectors have received a large share of
the pro-poor spending since 2003: the budget executed for
these sectors has increased from 0.7 percent of GDP in 2003
to 2.6 percent in 2006. An external audit of the HIPC account
was completed recently.

Triggers
4. Public expenditure management
(a) Implementation of a modernized
budget-execution system, providing
information from commitment to
payment, and allowing for the
monitoring of arrears;

Progress status
Ongoing. (a) The budget-execution system is improving. A
reporting mechanism is in place within the public finance
management system. General budget execution reports (États
de suivi budgetaire, or ESBs) can be produced automatically
using the Budget-Treasury’s unique database. Production of
ESBs remains irregular and of uneven quality. Treasury
accounts, describing the financial flows and account balance
is produced monthly. On this basis, State financial operations
table (TOFE) is prepared for thorough monitoring. However,
the Treasury cash balance is not yet exhaustive or reliable.
Additional efforts are needed to guarantee the monitoring of
payments and occurrence of arrears.

(b) adoption and implementation of a
double-entry government accounting
system and a new chart of accounts;
and

(b) The double-entry system is being implemented. The staff
has been trained, equipment purchased, and software
developed. Additional efforts are needed for the staff to
master the new system;

(c) production of quarterly budget
execution reports using economic,
administrative, and functional
classifications.

(c) A new classification has been adopted. The budgetary
reports are produced using economic, administrative, and
functional classifications, but with a lag of 2-3 months.

5. Governance and service delivery
in priority sectors
(a) Completion of a budget-tracking
exercise on health, education, rural
development and infrastructure
expenditure, consisting of
(i) monitoring the execution of
poverty-related public expenditure;
(ii) evaluation by user groups of the
quality of related public services, and
(iii) evaluation by service-providers of
constraints to effective provision; and

Partially done. (a) (i) The treasury monitors poverty-related
public expenditures in all sectors, using the new budget
classifications. (ii) Evaluation by user groups of health
clinics and schools was conducted through an Institutional
and Governance Review (2005). (iii) Evaluation by service
providers in education and health was conducted through an
Institutional and Governance Review (2005).

(b) adoption and implementation of a
new procurement code and key
implementing decrees.

(b) The draft procurement code was adopted in April 2006.
The application laws were validated in October 2006. The
final version of the code and the laws need to be adopted by
the Council of Ministers, then by Parliament. The consultant
tasked with preparing a national procurement strategy and a
program of capacity reinforcement has issued a preliminary
report. The last step is to put in place institutions compatible
with the new code, and to make them operational.

(concluded)
(As of June 2007)
Triggers
6. Social and rural sectors
Adoption of sectoral development
strategies and related implementation
plans for health, education and rural
development, which are satisfactory to
IDA.

Progress status
Partially done. The country health status report was issued
in May 2005 (Health, nutrition and population country status
report – No. 35626-ZR). Health sector strategy was
completed in March 2006 based on the findings of this
report.
For education, the government finalized, in September 2004,
the Status Report on the National Education System, which
assesses the sector’s constraints, and adopted a draft action
plan for the Education for All (EFA) Initiative. The education
sector strategy was drafted in the second quarter of 2006.
An agriculture sector review was completed in May 2006.
The rural development strategy is under preparation.

7. Debt management
Installation and full activation of a
computerized debt-recording system,
covering public and publiclyguaranteed debt that can
(a) produce monthly debt-service
projections, and incorporate actual
disbursement and debt-service
payment execution data;
(b) produce advance monthly debtservice projections that will be
published quarterly; and
(c) support the centralization of debt
information into a single center.

Ongoing. A public debt management software (DMFAS)
was installed, and the public external debt outstanding was
recorded. However, the database still contains errors
(according to the evaluation by the UNCTAD mission in
March 2007), and it does not cover publicly-guaranteed debt.
Training of the relevant staff on debt management is ongoing. The implementation program is projected to be
completed by September 2007. Remaining activities are :

a) production of manual of procedures DMFAS;
b) study trips to exchange experiences with other users of
DMFAS;
c) training on portfolio management;
d) training on debt sustainability analysis using DSM.
OGEDEP does not yet produce or publish the debt service
projections. It also does not play the role of the single debt
information center, as other entities in the administration do
not systematically inform OGEDEP of debt-related activities.
Efforts to sensitize all parties involved in any matters
concerning public debt and restructuring of OGEDEP is
necessary to meet this trigger.

May 26, 2001, has been freely floating. On June 29, 2007, the rate was US$1=CGF 496.2.
Effective February 10, 2003, the DRC accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2 (a), 3, and
4, of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement. However, the DRC maintains measures that give rise to one
restriction and one multiple currency practice subject to Fund approval under Article VIII. The
exchange restriction involves an outstanding net debit position against other contracting members
under the inoperative regional payments agreement with the Economic Community of the Great
Lakes Countries. The multiple currency practice relates to a fixed exchange rate set on a quarterly
basis applying to transactions through the bilateral payments agreement with Zimbabwe.
X. Last Article IV Consultation:
The DRC is on the standard 12-month consultation cycle. The Executive Board concluded the last
Article IV consultation on August 19, 2005.

5
XI. Safeguards Assessment:
A safeguards assessment of the central bank (BCC) was completed on January 3, 2003. The
assessment concluded that there may be substantial risks of misreporting or misuse due to
vulnerabilities in the external audit mechanism, financial reporting, and system internal controls.
Staff findings, recommendations related to program conditionality, and other recommendations may
be found in IMF Country Report No. 03/161. Staff is monitoring BCC implementation of the
measures.

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO
RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
I. INTRODUCTION
1.
This annex first underscores the importance that the government of the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (DRC) attaches to effective partnership with international
development partners and foreign investors. It then summarizes the strategy and activities of
the World Bank Group (IDA, IFC, and MIGA) in the DRC. It concludes with a description of
areas of specific collaboration between the World Bank Group and the International
Monetary Fund.
II. PARTNERSHIP IN THE DRC’S DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY
2.
The new duly-elected government took office in February 2007. The government
presented to the Parliament its program for 2007–11, with five priority sectors,
infrastructure, employment, education, water and electricity, and health. The government’s
program also included a governance compact, which is a contract between the population and
itself. The new government’s intentions to implement change and improve the political,
economic and social environment are supported by development partners. The Consultative
Group meeting, which could not take place during the electoral period, is expected to resume
in November 2007. In that context, a technical meeting took place on June 25, 2007 in
Kinshasa during which a Priority Action Plan (PAP, July 2007–December 2008) was
endorsed by both the Government and the donor community. This will be followed up by a
Consultative Group in October 2007 to further mobilize donors support to the government
program.
3.
The PRSP was adopted by the outgoing transitional government, and was
endorsed by the new government. The PRSP is a result of extensive participatory
consultations at grassroots level as well as with the international development partners. The
full PRSP aims at restoring political stability, consolidating peace, and reducing poverty
through fostering accelerated growth. The strategy comprises five pillars: (i) promoting good
governance and consolidating peace; (ii) maintaining macroeconomic stability and growth;
(iii) improving access to social services and reducing vulnerability; (iv) combating
HIV/AIDS; and (v) improving community dynamics. The PRSP and the Joint Staff Advisory
Note (JSAN) were discussed by the World Bank’s Board of Directors on May 31, 2007.
III. BANK GROUP STRATEGY AND OPERATIONS (IDA, IFC, AND MIGA)
4.
Overall strategy. On July 31, 2001, the Executive Directors of IDA endorsed a
Transitional Support Strategy to map out Bank financial and nonfinancial support to the
DRC for the following 12–24 months, which included the Emergency Early Recovery
Project (EERP), the Economic Recovery Credit (ERC), the Private Sector Development and
Competitiveness Project (PSDC), and the Emergency Multi-Sector Rehabilitation and

11

Reconstruction Project (EMRRP), as described hereunder. The second TSS was discussed by
the Board on February 26, 2004 and covers the period 2004–06. A Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS) covering the period of 2007–10 is being prepared jointly with other donors in
order to be presented to the Executive Directors of IDA following consultations with the
newly elected government. The new CAS will be closely aligned with the PRSP.
5.
The 2004 TSS sets forth the scope and configuration of future support during 2004–
06. The TSS accompanied government efforts during the transition period, with a particular
focus on (i) social stability and security, (ii) high and shared growth, (iii) governance and
institutional strengthening, and (iv) social development.
6.
A Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) is under preparation, and is expected to be
presented to the Board of Directors by early November 2007. The CAS is an integral part of
the common assistance framework for the country, which is being developed through
extensive discussions and coordination with development partners, including the IMF, the
EC, the UN, and bilaterals. The governance compact proposed by the new government has
been endorsed by the development partners under this common assistance framework.
A. International Development Association (IDA)
7.
IDA provides support through trust funds and investment operations. There is
currently no development policy operation ongoing, the most recent one having closed in
December 2006. The IDA funds are made available on 100 percent grant basis in view of the
country’s debt burden. Total commitments amount to about US$ 1.9 billion. Operational
details are summarized in Table 1.
Trust funds
8.
The trust funds that are currently active target the areas of stabilization and recovery,
demobilization, capacity building, support for the PRSP, forest governance, and arrears
clearance.
Grants and credits
Development policy operations
9.
While the Fund leads the dialogue on overall macroeconomic framework, the Bank
leads the policy reform efforts of individual components contributing to good public finance
management. Since the re-engagement, IDA has provided three development policy
operations—the Economic Recovery Credit (ERC), the Post-Reunification Economic
Recovery Credit (PRERC), and the Transitional Support to Economic Recovery Operation
(TSERO). Through ERC, approved in 2002, the Bank led the policy dialogue in restructuring
the mining public enterprise, improving governance of the forestry sector, and reforming
public finance system, in addition to providing arrears-clearance process. The operation was
implemented satisfactorily and closed in June 2003. With PRERC, approved in 2004, the

12

Bank continued to lead the public finance reform dialogue through a civil service retirement
program, a domestic debt settlement program, and utilities billing and payment reforms.
These reforms allowed the government to start “cleaning house” by addressing the various
types of arrears accumulated by the previous regime. The operation was implemented
satisfactorily and closed in December 2005. The focus of the TSERO, approved in
December 2005 in the amount of SDR 62.1 million (US$90 million equivalent at the time of
negotiations), was on the continuation of improvements to the budget process, strengthening
the execution of pro-poor spending, implementation of civil service management reforms, the
continuation of support for reforms in natural resource sectors, and increased transparency on
the revenue side. Unlike the previous two operations, which had multiple thematic tranches,
TSERO was a stand-alone single- tranche operation. It disbursed fully in December 2005 and
is now closed.
Investment operations
10.
The IDA leads the dialogue with the authorities in the areas of social sector reforms,
demobilization and disarmament, infrastructure rehabilitation, and private sector
development. More specifically, investment operations include (i) infrastructure
rehabilitation, including power and roads; (ii) demobilization and reintegration;
(iii) emergency support to living conditions and urban, economic and social reunification
(iv) private sector development; (v) debt buy back operation; (vi) social development,
including multi-sectoral HIV/AIDS program and recently approved education project.
Implementation of projects to date is broadly satisfactory. See Table 1 for more information
about projects listed above.
Nonlending activities
11.
For several years prior to and during the first TSS (2001), IDA assistance also
emphasized nonlending activities and advisory services, including trust funds and grants,
to improve the understanding of the socioeconomic context, rebuild the knowledge base to
support policy dialogue and design effective poverty-reduction strategies. FY03 activities
included a Public Expenditure Review, which focused on the overall structure of
expenditures; specific issues in the health, education, and transport sectors; evaluation of the
DRC’s ability to monitor execution of poverty-related expenditures; strengthening of public
expenditure management systems. In FY06, the Country Financial Accountability
Assessment (CFAA) was undertaken, and was officially delivered to the Government and the
donor community in Kinshasa. A workshop was also organized for Government delegates,
the Reform Committee, Parliament, Cour des Comptes and several donors to validate the
conclusions and action plan of the report. Based of this assessment, authorities continue to
gradually implement recommendations for an efficient and transparent spending circuit. A
double entry accounting plan has been recently implemented. The Agricultural Sector
Review was completed in FY06. The Forest Sector Review was published in FY07 with coauthorship of a series of research centers and civil society organizations.

B. International Finance Corporation (IFC)
12.
IFC supported the cellular telephone operator Celtel with a US$7 million loan in 2002
and a further US$20 million in 2003. Currently, IFC is conducting a needs assessment of
local small and medium enterprises to help determine potential future interventions. IFC has
made a US$4.9 million equity investment for a 7.5 percent equity stake in Kingamyambo
Musonoi Tailings SARL (KMT), which could become one of the first mining projects to be
developed under the new Mining Code. The next step will be to complete a bankable
feasibility study and raise the financing for the project. Construction is planned to begin in
end–2007 or early 2008. In the financial sector, IFC plans to assist banks operating in the
DRC with trade financing facilities in order to help establish routine trade finance operations.
IFC will work closely with the Bank in the context of the PSDC project to help implement
specific sectoral initiatives and key investment projects. Considerable effort has already been
spent in resolving outstanding disputes in the DRC, two of which, UTEXAFRICA, a textile
business, and the Grand Hotel du Congo (formerly Inter-Continental) were settled in 2002
and 2005, respectively. A settlement is being sought actively for the last dispute remaining
on the books, SOTEXKI, a textile business in Kisangani.
C. Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA)
13.
MIGA can now issue guarantees for projects because the DRC has paid its initial
capital subscription (the DRC has been a member of the agency since 2003). Several projects
are under consideration, notably in the mining sector. On May 3, 2005, MIGA approved its
first project in DRC for a US$13.3 million in guarantee coverage for the Dikulushi copper
and silver mine. The guarantees approved provide coverage for investments and loans by
Anvil Mining Ltd. of Canada and RMB International (Dublin) Limited of Ireland to Anvil
Mining Congo, SAR of the DRC, against the risks of transfer restriction, expropriation,
breach of contract and war and civil disturbance. The project was also the first extractive
industries project to be considered and approved by the Board of the World Bank Group,
which followed the conclusion of the Bank-sponsored Extractive Industries Review in
August 2004. In addition, MIGA is currently looking at non-mining deals in agribusiness,
manufacturing and services.
IV. BANK-FUND COLLABORATION IN SPECIFIC AREAS
14.
In addition to its direct assistance to the DRC, the Bank also supports policy reforms
in close collaboration with the Fund in a number of areas: donor coordination, public finance
management, decentralization, financial sector reform, governance and anticorruption, and
the PRSP process. The Fund takes the lead on macroeconomic policies aimed at facilitating
stabilization and sustainable growth. The Bank complements the Fund’s work through its
support to structural reforms. Table 2 details areas of collaboration and areas where either the
Bank or the Fund lead.

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO
STATISTICAL ISSUES
Data provision to the Fund is adequate for surveillance and program monitoring purposes,
but the quality of the national accounts, balance of payments, and government finance
statistics need upgrading. In spite of the difficulties, the authorities have continued to
produce an array of economic and financial statistics, most of which are contained in the
annual report of the Central Bank of the Congo (BCC) or its monthly statistical bulletin. The
Office de Gestion de la Dette Publique (OGEDEP) compiles a comprehensive set of external
debt statistics. Statistical issues related to specific areas are described below.
After a fact-finding mission to Kinshasa in June 2001 in real sector and government finance
statistics, STA provided technical assistance on government finance statistics in March–April
and September 2002, augmented by capacity-building support from the World Bank. In
October 2003, a STA multisector mission assessed economic and financial data and proposed
measures to improve them. Since late-2004, a real sector statistics advisor, based in Kinshasa
and serving both the Democratic Republic of Congo (approximately 70 percent of his time)
and the Republic of Congo, has been assisting the authorities.
On April 24, 2004, the DRC began participating in the IMF General Data Dissemination
System (GDDS); its metadata (comprehensive information on statistical production,
dissemination practices, and plans for improvement) are posted on the IMF Dissemination
Standards Bulletin Board and are due for update.
National accounts
The national accounts are compiled in constant and current prices by the Directorate of
Research of the BCC and published yearly. The compilation methodology conforms to the
System of National Accounts 1968 (1968 SNA) and is based on the balance sheets of
enterprises and the results of surveys of public and semipublic enterprises and agencies. Most
of the surveys date from the late 1980s. The activities of the traditional sector (including the
informal sector) are estimated with extrapolation techniques using industry-specific data that
are outdated. As a result, GDP is likely to be underestimated.
With help from the resident statistical advisor, work on the national accounts is underway to
introduce 2005 as the new base year, incorporate the results of a recent household survey
(1-2-3 Survey), as well as implement the methodological recommendations of the 1993 SNA.
While outputs of this work remain to be validated and officially published, 2005 GDP
estimates show a considerable upward revision compared to the published data.
Employment and unemployment
Annual data on employment in the central government are available from the Ministries of
Economy, Finance, and Budget, together with data on employment in the formal sector.
Prices
Consumer price indices are calculated for Kinshasa by the BCC, the National Statistics
Institute (INS), the Institute of Economic and Social Research (IESR), and the Economics
Section of the U.S. Embassy in Kinshasa. The IESR also calculates a monthly consumer

19
price index for the Lubumbashi market. The household surveys on which these calculations
are based date back to the late 1980s; they need to be updated to take account of changes in
household consumption patterns and demographic shifts, while geographical coverage should
be expanded.
Government finance statistics
The BCC produces aggregated monthly statistics on a cash basis based on its own accounting
for the government cash operations. The treasury produces two sets of monthly statistics
based on its own records: one relates to the transactions executed through the BCC, the other
set attempts to consolidate operations through commercial bank accounts and off-budget
operations. These statistics do not rely on an integrated double-entry public accounting
system and do not provide sufficient details about the nature of expenditures owing to
problems in the expenditure chain. However, the treasury has started to produce quarterly
expenditure data reports by ministry and institution.
The current work on tax administration and expenditure control is expected to improve the
quality and timeliness of fiscal statistics. In parallel with technical assistance on public
expenditure management, the STA multisector statistics advisor has been advising on
government finance statistics, producing improvements in the quality of the statistics.
Furthermore, adoption of a simplified double-entry bookkeeping system should significantly
improve the availability of data on government financial operations.
In 2003 the DRC reported annual data up to 2002 for the IMF’s Government Finance
Statistics Yearbook in the format of the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001, but has
not reported subsequently.
Monetary and financial statistics
The BCC Directorate of Research regularly produces timely monetary statistics. These
statistics are now generally reliable but some problems remain with the classification of
accounts.
Since the last money and banking statistics mission in June 2000, BCC reporting of data for
publication in the IMF’s International Financial Statistics (IFS) has improved and monetary
data are currently reported on time. The 2003 multisector statistics mission recommended a
new chart of accounts for the BCC and other deposit-taking institutions, including the
information needed for sectorization of economic units and classification of financial assets.
Balance of payments
Balance of payments statistics are prepared annually based on information on the exports and
imports of large public and semipublic enterprises, BCC payment records, and a survey of
the foreign operations of residents. The estimates also take account of information on the
informal sector and foreign aid flows provided by the World Bank and the local UN
Development Program (UNDP) office, which collects the data from the European Union,
embassies, and nongovernmental organizations. However, the 2003 multisector mission
found that, due to computer problems, data have not been processed since 1999, so balance

20
of payments statistics are compiled using data from different sources, supplemented by
estimates. The mission suggested that the BCC implement a system of quarterly surveys of
corporations that are authorized to hold accounts overseas. The mission also recommended
reinvigoration of a working group comprising staff of the customs and other agencies to
prepare quarterly foreign trade data and take measures to improve data on services and
transfers. No external sector data are reported to STA for publication.
External and domestic debt
OGEDEP compiles external and domestic debt statistics that are of reasonable quality in
spite of limited computer facilities. However, data on public enterprise foreign debt and in
particular on cross-arrears in the public sector are still of very poor quality. The World Bank
has been providing assistance in the compilation of cross-arrears in the public sector and
public sector arrears with the private sector.
Public enterprise sector
There is no comprehensive database on the operations of public enterprises, although IMF
missions are provided some information on the operations of individual enterprises.
Generally, data are provided annually and become available with at least a six-month delay.
As part of its public enterprise reform project, the World Bank has been collecting data
pertaining to the sector.
Social indicators
The most consistent data are assembled for the UNDP human development, poverty, and
gender-related indices. Two multiple indicator cluster surveys carried out between 1996 and
2001 in collaboration with the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) also provide important social
indicators. A national household living standards survey, assisted by IDA and other
institutions, is planned. In addition, in the context of the interim poverty reduction strategy
paper (I-PRSP), the authorities, with assistance from the World Bank and the UNDP, have
begun to construct a comprehensive database for social indicators.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
September 5, 2007

This statement provides information on recent developments received since the staff report
was issued. It does not change the thrust of the staff appraisal.
1.
Recent macroeconomic indicators have been encouraging. In June-July,
annualized inflation dropped below 12 percent, the end-year target; the Congo franc was
stable, slightly below CF500 per US dollar; and gross foreign exchange reserves covered
about 3 weeks of imports. The improved situation made it possible for the central bank to
reduce its base rate from 50.0 percent at end-March to 22.5 percent in August.
2.
Preliminary indications are that quantitative benchmarks under the staff
monitored program (SMP) were met at end-June. A narrower-than-anticipated fiscal
deficit on account of higher revenue led to a reduction in net credit to the government. This,
however, may have been facilitated by unanticipated government revenue, the nature of
which remains to be determined.
3.
Pressure on spending has been building up following the promulgation of an
expansionary 2007 budget in July. In particular, the government is unlikely to keep the
wage bill below 5.5 percent of GDP as targeted under the SMP, since the budget calls for a
wage bill equivalent to 6.8 percent of GDP. Already, parliamentarians have tripled their own
salaries and teachers are asking a large pay raise before starting the new school year.
Nevertheless, the authorities reiterated that they would continue implementing a treasury
cash-flow plan consistent with the overall objectives of the SMP.
4.
Three of the nine structural benchmarks under the SMP were met at end-June.
These are the installation of a new computerized accounting system of the central bank, the
external audit of the central bank 2006 accounts, and the installation of a new civil service
payroll in Kinshasa. For the other benchmarks, the draft 2007 budget submitted to the
National Assembly provided for higher expenditures (0.3 percent of GDP) compared with
SMP fiscal framework; the organizational audit of the Central Bank (BCC) was completed in
August instead of June, because the initial draft was considered unsatisfactory; the action
plan to finalize the UBC/BC merger is yet to be adopted; the audit of the expenditure
financed by HIPC resources was completed in June 2007, but the government is still working
on an action plan to implement its recommendations; the audit of government expenditure for
December 2006-Februry 2007 is not completed; and the main public-private partnership
contracts have not been published.

The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is in debt distress. At end 2006,
debt service on public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) external debt amounted to 26 percent
of exports while the net present value (NPV) of PPG external debt exceeded 300 percent of
exports, 90 percent of GDP, and 700 percent of government revenue. As a result, most debt
burden indicators substantially exceed their policy-based thresholds under the baseline
scenario.2 Further, the DRC has not serviced any of its debt service obligations to Paris Club
creditors since July 2006. Even if the security situation stabilizes and macroeconomic and
structural policies improve substantially as assumed under the baseline scenario, external
debt indicators will remain above the relevant policy-based thresholds for many years to
come and even worsen in the event of adverse exogenous shocks. Accordingly, the DRC
should seek external financing mainly in the form of grants. It should strengthen its track
record of policy implementation with a view to reaching the completion point under the
enhanced HIPC initiative as soon as possible, which would allow it to benefit from

This is the first debt sustainability analysis for the DRC prepared under the joint World Bank/IMF Debt
Sustainability Framework for Low Income Countries. Bank and Fund staffs also completed a HIPC DSA jointly
in July 2003 when the DRC reached its decision point under the enhanced HIPC Initiative. (“Democratic
Republic of the Congo - Decision Point Document for the Enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC)
Initiative”, IMF Country Report No. 03/267 and IDA/R 2003-0059) This is, however, the first DSA that
establishes a debt distress rating for the DRC.
2

The World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) rates the DRC as a low performer.
Under the joint World Bank/ IMF debt sustainability framework, the corresponding thresholds are 30 percent
for the NPV of external PPG debt to GDP ratio, 100 percent for the NPV of external PPG debt to exports ratio,
200 percent for the NPV of external PPG debt to revenue ratio, 15 percent for the external PPG debt service to
exports ratio, and 25 percent for the external PPG debt service to revenue ratio. (“OperationalFramework for
Debt Sustainability Assessments in Low-Income Countries – Further Considerations”, www.imf.org and
IDA/R2005-0056). Assuming the DRC reaches the HIPC completion point by mid-2008 and benefits from debt
relief under enhanced HIPC and the MDR initiatives, debt burden indicators would fall below policy-based
thresholds (see Paragraph 11).

substantial stock-of-debt relief under this initiative as well as the Multilateral Debt Reduction
Initiative (MDRI).
I. BACKGROUND
2.
Three decades of economic mismanagement, culminating in civil strife, led to the
accumulation of a large stock of external arrears.3 At end-2001, the DRC’s arrears on
PPG external debt amounted to US$10.6 billion. Clearance of close to US$2 billion of arrears
to multilateral institutions and progress in stabilizing the macroeconomic situation, followed
by the approval of a PRGF arrangement in July 2002, paved the way for the HIPC decision
point in 2003. At the decision point and based on the outstanding stock of debt at end-2002
of US$8.4 billion in NPV terms,4 HIPC debt relief to the DRC was estimated at
US$6.3 billion in NPV terms.
3.
At the time of the decision point, it was assumed that the DRC would reach the
completion point shortly after the end of the PRGF arrangement, in the third quarter
of 2006. However, substantial policy slippages towards the final phase of the democratic
transition prevented the completion of the last review under the PRGF arrangement, which
had been extended to end-March 2006. Since then, Fund staff has helped the authorities
design and monitor two Staff Monitored Programs (SMPs)5, with a view to strengthening
economic policy implementation and allowing for the development of a credible mediumterm program to be supported under a successor PRGF arrangement. The DRC also
completed and adopted officially a full PRSP in July 2006 and has made progress towards
meeting the HIPC completion point triggers. Completing the first review under a new PRGF
and satisfying the HIPC completion point triggers would pave the way for the DRC to reach
the completion point, possibly by mid-2008, and hence the delivery of the remaining HIPC
and MDRI debt relief.

3

The DRC faced negative growth rates over 13 consecutive years, leading to a dramatic decline of GDP per
capita (in constant 2000 US dollars) from US$400 at independence in 1960 to US$100 in 2001.

provided by major multilateral creditors.
While IDA continues to disburse interim
HIPC debt relief,7 interim assistance from the Fund was disbursed until June 2006, based on
the decision taken upon the completion of the fifth review under the PRGF arrangement.
Further interim assistance from the Fund would require approval of a new PRGF
arrangement. The DRC has signed debt relief agreements with a number of commercial
creditors. It has also benefited from a flow rescheduling on Cologne terms and debt relief
beyond HIPC assistance by Paris Club creditors. However, the DRC has been unable to meet
its debt service obligations to Paris Club creditors since July 2006. The Chairman of the Paris
Club indicated to the authorities that the treatment of the resulting arrears would have to
await an agreement on a new PRGF arrangement.
II. EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS 8
5.
The baseline scenario of this DSA assumes the stabilization of the security
situation and adoption of prudent macroeconomic policies and structural reforms—
especially those aimed at strengthening governance. These include enhancing transparency in
the mining sector, reducing the costs of doing business, strengthening tax collection,
improving budget preparation and execution, and reforming the civil service. The
implementation of prudent policies and reforms, together with a recovery of the mining
sector, is projected to lead to strong economic growth through 2012 (see Box 1).9

6

These estimates exclude amounts of penalties and late interest due to London Club creditors. The DRC is
working on a World Bank financed buy-back operation for its debt to London Club creditors.

7

The DRC would reach its one-third limit of IDA interim debt relief in August 2009.

8

The external debt sustainability analysis provides information only on the NPV of PPG external debt, as
information on private external debt is not available. For the NPV calculation, a 5 percent discount rate is used.
Debt service payments are converted to US dollars using WEO exchange rate projections consistent with the
requirements of the joint World Bank/IMF LIC Debt Sustainability Framework. (“Operational Framework for
Debt Sustainability Assessments in Low-Income Countries – Further Considerations”, www.imf.org and
IDA/R2005-0056).
9

The baseline is consistent with the macroeconomic framework envisaged for the period 2007-2012 in the
context of the 2007 consultation under the Article IV of the IMF articles of agreement. However, the latter
(continued)

4
6.
Consistent with current guidelines,10 the baseline scenario assumes only HIPC
interim relief. Multilateral creditors provide interim HIPC debt relief according to the debt
relief agreements. For the Paris Club, debt service in the interim period is calculated
assuming a Cologne flow treatment and debt relief beyond HIPC assistance. For non-Paris
Club creditors or commercial creditors comparable treatment to the Paris Club has been
assumed, unless debt relief agreements have already been signed.11
7.
Under the baseline scenario, all external debt burden indicators breach their
thresholds (Table 1a). In 2006, all debt stock indicators, i.e., the NPV ratios of debt to GDP,
export and revenue, markedly exceed the policy-based thresholds, and are projected to
converge towards their thresholds only at the end of the 20–year projection period. The
gradual decline of these ratios largely reflects the projected rebound of exports and real GDP
growth, together with the assumption that external financial support mainly takes the form of
grants, with new loans contracted on highly concessional terms. A broadly similar trend
applies if principal macroeconomic variables assume their 10–year historical average, as
captured in the historical average scenario.
8.
While the long-term macroeconomic projections in this DSA are in line with the
decision point DSA,12 the medium-term growth prospects have improved. The recent
political transition and high commodity prices have sparked investor interest in the mining
sector. New investments in the sector are expected to significantly increase, boosting mineral
production, especially copper and cobalt, over the medium term. This is expected to raise real
GDP and export growth rates for 2008-12 relative to projections in past DSAs.13 Imports

reflects the impact of the debt stock reductions under the enhanced HIPC and MDRI initiatives that would result
from the DRC reaching the completion under the enhanced HIPC initiative.
10

“Staff Guidance Note on the Application of the Joint Fund-Bank Debt Sustainability Framework for LowIncome Countries”, April 2007, www.imf.org and IDA/No. 39748.

11

The NPV of debt in this DSA also differs from decision point data as a result of methodological differences
between the joint Bank-Fund LIC DSA framework and the HIPC methodology. These are using: a) a fixed
5 percent discount rate instead of currency-specific discount rates under HIPC; b) WEO exchange rate
projections instead of fixed exchange rates as of end-of the base date; and c) annual exports instead of a threeyear average of exports in the NPV of debt to exports ratio. Moreover, debt relief simulations in the current
DSA have been updated reflecting the change in the expected HIPC completion point date and updated
information on commercial debt.

Countries (HIPC) Initiative”, IMF Country Report No. 03/267 and IDA/R2003-0059

13

The decision point DSA assumed an average real GDP growth of 6 percent during 2008-2012, while the
current baseline has an average growth rate of 8.2 percent. The IMF published a DSA for the DRC in 2005
which projected an average real GDP growth of 6.7 percent during 2008 - 2012. The improved growth
projection in the current DSA is based on more recent information on commodity prices and mining sector
output projections. However, the long-term projections in both DSAs are in line with the current LIC DSA.

5
related to the investment in the mining sector also lead to a relative widening of the current
account deficit during the same period, largely financed through foreign direct investment.
9.
These baseline macroeconomic projections are subject to significant risks. Poor
governance, unresolved security issues, weak implementation capacity and lower than
envisaged donor support may hinder the consistent implementation of sound policies and
reforms as well as the impacts of these measures. Moreover, given the DRC’s high
dependence on mining exports, it remains vulnerable to adverse terms of trade shocks.
Finally, the current security tension especially in the eastern provinces could escalate.

10.
All debt burden indicators are projected to exceed their thresholds under the
stress tests (Table 1b). If the DRC contracts loans on less concessional terms its debt stock
indicators would deteriorate substantially. The NPV of debt to GDP ratio and NPV of debt to
revenue ratio, for example, would reach 56 percent and 285 percent, in 2017, respectively.
Similarly, a slump in export growth in 2008 and 2009 would significantly and adversely
affect the DRC’s debt to export indicators, raising its NPV of debt to exports ratio to
310 percent and its debt service to exports ratio to 23 percent in 2017.

6
Box 1: Democratic Republic of the Congo – Macroeconomic Assumptions Underlying the Baseline
•

Since 2002, real GDP growth has averaged 5.5 percent. Construction and telecommunications
contributed significantly to growth, reflecting a recovery of economic activity after years of civil strife.
Aggregate demand rebounded on the back of large international support for reconstruction and the political
transition and favorable terms of trade.

•

Assuming that the DRC maintains security and strengthens its record of policy implementation, including
major improvements in governance, real GDP growth is projected to increase to 8 percent a year during
2007–12 led by a mining rebound and a continuation of the reconstruction efforts of the past years. Large
investments in copper and cobalt are expected to increase their output to historical production levels by
2012. Consequently, the mining sector is expected to grow at on average 17 percent between 2008 and
2012 in real terms.1 Over the long run, real GDP is projected to stabilize at around 5 percent a year as the
strong recovery tapers off over time.

•

Inflation is projected to decrease from 18 percent at end 2006 to 8 percent in 2008 and is projected to
remain at that rate over the long run. With a view to reducing the DRC’s vulnerability to external shocks,
gross international reserves are projected to be gradually rebuilt from the equivalent of 3 weeks of nonaid related imports in 2006 to about 9 weeks in 2012. The nominal exchange rate relative to the US dollar
is assumed to depreciate in line with the inflation differential between the DRC and the United States.
However, potentially large capital inflows that the DRC could attract if the security situation and
governance improve, could lead to a real appreciation of the currency, which in turn could lead to lower
than projected debt burden indicators.

•

Exports of goods and services are projected to increase on average by 11.4 percent per year in 2007–12
and by 6.0 percent over the long run. The initial export boom reflects the coming on stream of important
projects to rehabilitate the DRC’s large mining sector. The rehabilitation of the DRC’s infrastructure could
also contribute to the development of other exports, including agricultural products. Imports are expected
to increase sharply in 2008 related to large mining and infrastructure projects, continuing to grow at
10 percent till 2012 before assuming a long-term growth rate of 5 percent.

•

The non-interest current account deficit was estimated to be equivalent to 4.9 percent of GDP in 2006
and projected to peak at about 9.0 percent of GDP in 2011. The fluctuations of the current account balance
reflect the lumpiness of imports related to mining projects. Thereafter, it will gradually narrow as exports
pick up and imports decline. The widening current account deficit during the 2008–12 period is assumed to
be financed mainly by foreign direct investment, with net FDI inflows averaging 9 percent of GDP
between 2008 and 2012.

•

The overall fiscal deficit (including grants) is projected to shift from near balance in 2006 to a deficit of
some 2.8 percent of GDP by 2012. This assumes the execution of reforms to widen the tax base, strengthen
tax and customs administration, which would help raise revenue by some 3 percentage points of GDP over
the next five years. On that basis, public expenditure could increase by 7 percentage points, particularly to
help address the DRC’s substantial social and infrastructure rehabilitation needs, on a non-inflationary and
sustainable basis.

•

Donor support is assumed to increase subject to significant improvement in governance and
macroeconomic policies. Under the baseline, external grants would increase, as a share of GDP, from
2 percent in 2004 to 6 percent in 2012 and remain at around this level going forward.

•

Achieving the macroeconomic objectives will, however, be a challenge. Beyond the fragile security and
political situation, risks include: (i) fiscal slippages that could destabilize a fragile economy; (ii) significant
adverse terms of trade shocks; (iii) slower than projected private-sector led growth; (iv) lower-thananticipated donor support if governance does not improve markedly; and (v) slow progress in structural
reforms, possibly due to limited implementation capacity.

1

The DRC has Africa’s largest deposits of copper, cobalt and coltan, and significant reserves of diamonds and oil.
After years of economic mismanagement, poor governance and conflict, the contribution of the mining sector to
GDP declined from 25 percent of GDP in the mid-1980s, to less than 10 percent of GDP in the early 2000s.

7
11.
The DRC’s debt burden indicators are projected to fall below their thresholds if
it benefits from debt relief under the enhanced HIPC and the MDRI initiatives. Under
an alternative scenario, which assumes the DRC reaches the HIPC completion point in mid2008, the NPV of government and government-guaranteed external debt would fall to the
equivalent of 16.0 percent of GDP, 48 percent of exports, and 114 percent of government
revenue by 2008.
12.
Even after the completion point is reached, the DRC’s debt sustainability is
likely to remain vulnerable to adverse exogenous shocks. Applying the standardized stress
tests to the post-completion point scenario, it can be shown that under the most extreme
stress tests all debt stock indicators would breach their thresholds, two of them over sustained
period of time.14
III. PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
The DRC’s domestic debt is estimated to be relatively low following its
restructuring in 2005. Identified government domestic debt15 was equivalent to 0.5 percent
of GDP at end 2006 and is expected to be paid off by end-2007. Thereafter, the baseline
fiscal framework assumes zero net domestic borrowing.
13.

14.
As a result, the above sustainability analysis for external debt broadly applies
for total government and government-guaranteed debt (Tables 2a and 2b). Under the
baseline scenario, the NPV of public debt to GDP ratio decreases only gradually to the
relevant policy thresholds towards the end of the 20-year projection period.
IV. CONCLUSIONS
15.
The DRC is currently in debt distress. Even if the security situation stabilizes and
macroeconomic and structural policies lead to robust recovery, as assumed under the baseline
scenario, the external debt indicators would breach policy-based thresholds. Moreover, even
after reaching the HIPC completion point and benefiting from debt relief under the enhanced
HIPC and MDRI initiatives, the DRC remains vulnerable to shocks that could lead to lower
exports and economic growth. It is therefore essential that the DRC adheres to prudent
macroeconomic policies and implement significant structural reforms far reaching structural
reforms, while seeking external financing mostly in the form of grants or loans on highly
concessional terms. It should also strengthen its track record of policy implementation with a
view to quickly reaching the completion point under the enhanced HIPC Initiative.

14

A combination of different shocks leads to the largest increase in NPV of debt to GDP and NPV of debt to
exports ratio. The most extreme shock for the NPV of debt to exports ratio is the shock on export growth.

Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline, while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly as
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4
Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5
Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6
Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
September 21, 2007

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2007 Article IV Consultation with the
Democratic Republic of the Congo
On September 5, 2007, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).1
Background
The DRC has made significant economic and political progress since 2001, after years of
conflict and political instability. Adoption of prudent macroeconomic policies resulted in rapid
disinflation and the stabilization of the exchange rate. The implementation of structural reforms
made the economy more open, removed major price distortions, and strengthened
macroeconomic policy management. These, combined with improved confidence fostered by
progress on the political and security fronts—including the formation of a transition government
of national unity in 2002—helped increase investment and renew growth.
However, economic performance weakened starting in 2005, as the government’s focus turned
to the drafting of a new constitution and the preparation for general elections. In 2006, large
money financed government overspending, primarily for security and the elections, resulted in
the Congo franc to depreciate by 15 percent against the US dollar, 12-month inflation to rise to
18.2 percent, and gross international reserves to decline to US$150 million (3 weeks of
imports). Real GDP growth, which had picked up to 6.5 percent in 2004–05 slowed to 5 percent
in 2006 because of weak manufacturing production and a drop in diamond exports. Major
Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
reforms suffered delays, including those in the mining sector, public enterprises, the civil
service, the social sectors, customs administration, and the central bank.
The first democratic elections in four decades were successfully held in 2006, bringing to an
end the mandate of the transitional government and leading to the formation of a new
government in February 2007.
The new government has taken steps to reestablish macroeconomic discipline. Strong revenue
collection and expenditure restraint reduced net bank credit to the government. This tightened
liquidity conditions and contributed to a decline in base money. Consequently, since last May,
the Congo franc has appreciated by 12 percent, annualized inflation declined to 12 percent and
international reserves increased to US$190 million. Preliminary data indicate that real GDP
could grow by 6½ percent in 2007. However, the DRC accumulated external arrears vis-à-vis
bilateral creditors, and its external debt remains unsustainable.
Despite recent improvement, risks to macroeconomic stability remain high. In particular, the
2007 budget promulgated last July is very expansionary. It calls for a very large increase in
domestically financed spending, including on wages, which is unlikely to be matched by a
commensurate increase in revenue.
Executive Board Assessment
They commended the authorities of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) for the
successful completion of the first democratic elections in four decades, and encouraged the
new government to work with all parties to improve security and bring peace to all the country’s
provinces.
Directors noted that the generally prudent macroeconomic policies implemented by the new
government have contributed to some encouraging results, with improved fiscal position,
reduced inflation, strengthened international reserves, and an appreciation of the Congo franc.
They regretted, however, the recent spending pressures in the wake of the expansionary 2007
budget and the delays in structural reforms. Against this background, and with continuing
security concerns, Directors considered that the economic situation remains challenging. They
called for early actions to further strengthen fiscal discipline, improve governance, and carry
forward structural reforms to lay the basis for sustained growth and progress toward the MDGs.
Directors stressed that the 2007 program monitored by Fund staff (SMP) provides an
opportunity to establish credibility for good economic management and pave the way for a
medium-term program that could be supported by a PRGF arrangement. In this context,
Directors noted that, under the SMP, all quantitative benchmarks for end-June and several
structural benchmarks have been met. Strong leadership will be important to build a broad
consensus for the needed reforms and ensure their effective implementation. While also
underscoring the importance of strong implementation, some Directors called on the authorities
and the staff to work towards early consideration of a new PRGF-supported program.

3
Directors stressed that the implementation of the 2007 budget, as promulgated, would put
macroeconomic stability at risk. Optimistic revenue projections and a concomitant expansion of
spending would likely lead to a new cycle of widening fiscal deficit, rapid money expansion,
depreciation of the currency, and rising inflation. Directors also noted that the large increase in
the wage bill would undermine fiscal sustainability and crowd out pro-poor spending. They
encouraged the authorities to take the necessary measures for meeting the fiscal objectives of
the 2007 SMP, and noted their assurances on the implementation of a Treasury cash-flow plan
consistent with the SMP.
Directors stressed the need for the government to continue avoiding central bank financing of
fiscal deficits, as this has helped improve macroeconomic stability. They considered improving
public financial management (PFM) critical in this regard, and more generally, underscored its
importance for enhancing the efficiency and credibility of the budget process. Directors called
for reforms to strengthen tax administration and revenue collection, rationalize expenditure
procedures and improve expenditure prioritization, better track pro-poor spending, and establish
an affordable and efficient civil service. Directors noted the authorities’ planned devolution of
government revenue to the provinces. They encouraged the authorities to proceed cautiously, in
line with the devolution of spending responsibilities and taking into account PFM capacity
building requirements in the provinces.
Directors noted that monetary policy should remain tight to reduce inflation. This requires
strengthening monetary policy management and enhancing the central bank’s credibility and
independence. Reinforcing financial sector supervision is also needed to strengthen the banking
system and deepen financial intermediation.
Directors noted that the floating exchange rate regime is appropriate for the DRC and has
served the country well. They encouraged the authorities to limit interventions to smoothing
short-term fluctuations, and achieving the central bank’s international reserve target. Directors
encouraged the authorities to lift the remaining exchange restriction and multiple currency
practice.
To promote growth and reduce poverty, Directors emphasized that the medium-term policy
agenda should include bold strategies to combat corruption—especially in the natural resources
sector—privatize public enterprises, strengthen the judiciary, and reduce the regulatory burden
on business. In that regard, Directors called for the effective implementation of the relevant laws
to fight corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. They welcomed the
authorities’ intention to meet the requirements of the Extractive Industries Transparency
Initiative. Progress in these areas will be essential to mobilize donor support.
Directors emphasized that rural sector development and increased investment in human
capital—health and education—will be critical in addressing entrenched poverty. In this regard,
Directors encouraged the authorities to proceed with the costing of the proposed pro-poor
programs and the development of mechanisms to monitor the effectiveness of the programs.

4
Directors noted that the DRC’s external debt is unsustainable. They encouraged the authorities
to quickly establish a track record for prudent policies and reforms to help advance toward
qualifying for debt relief under the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Country and Multilateral
Debt Relief initiatives. Directors underscored the need for prudent debt policy and strengthened
debt management capacity.

Statement by Laurean W. Rutayisire, Executive Director
for the Democratic Republic of the Congo
September 5, 2007

On behalf of my Congolese authorities, I would like to thank Management for maintaining
dialogue with the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) throughout the period since the
beginning of the political transition up to now. In particular, I thank the Managing Director
for recently holding a discussion with the Minister of Finance on the way forward in the
relation between the DRC and the IMF. I would also like to commend staff for their quality
advice and technical assistance to my Congolese authorities and, in particular, for the
constructive policy dialogue during their visit to Kinshasa in the context of the 2007 Article
IV consultation.
As I have underlined before, the DRC has successfully implemented a three-year PRGFsupported program between 2002 and 2006, albeit the non completion of the last review due
to fiscal slippages in the run-up of critical elections that put an end to a long political
transition. Under this PRGF-supported program, tremendous progress in various areas of
policy and reform implementation was accomplished. Important structural reforms
undertaken include, but are not limited to: unification of the multiple exchange rates; price
liberalization; implementation of new procedures for expenditure and budget classification;
launching of the civil service reform; establishment of a Large Taxpayer Unit; adoption of
investment, mining and forestry codes. Efforts are currently pursued to complete the reform
agenda, albeit difficulties stemming from capacity problems and exogenous factors.
On the policy front, the DRC has also demonstrated resolve to reestablish track record in
implementation of sound policies. The country succeeded to bring down hyperinflation by
taking necessary steps to tighten fiscal policy and improve public financial management. In
its first three months in office (February through April 2007), the current government
successfully addressed the underlying macroeconomic problems by better controlling
spending, reducing the financing of government operations by the central bank, thereby
lowering inflationary pressures, enhancing the international reserves cushion, and stabilizing
the exchange rate.
A tightening of policies in the last few months, on both the fiscal and monetary fronts, has
contributed to stabilizing the macroeconomic situation and reducing net bank credit to the
government, curbing down annualized inflation in June-July to below the end-year target of
12 percent, allowing the exchange rate to appreciate somewhat and the central bank (BCC) to
re-accumulate reserves up to 3 weeks of imports coverage. On the spending front, my
authorities continue to implement their treasury cash-flow plan, in line with the objectives of
the 2007 budget framework agreed with Fund staff.

2
On the structural front, four out of nine benchmarks under the SMP have been met on time.
These include: the new computerized accounting system of the BCC; the submission to
Parliament of a draft 2007 Budget, consistent with the macroeconomic framework laid out in
the letter of the Government to the IMF Management; the completion of the external audit of
the central bank’s 2006 accounts; and the installation of a new civil service payroll (Paie
transitoire simplifiée) in Kinshasa. Concerning the benchmark related to the 2007 Budget, it
is important to underscore that my Congolese authorities continue to meet their commitment
to spending based on the treasury cash-flow, and the Minister of Finance reiterated this
commitment to Fund Management during their recent meeting in Maputo, Mozambique.
Regarding a fifth benchmark, the organizational audit of the BCC was completed, albeit with
some delay due to the non respect by the auditor of the terms of reference initially agreed.
The action plan envisaged to implement the recommendations of the auditor will be finalized
this month after validation of the final report. Further, on another benchmark, the audit of the
expenditure financed by HIPC resources was completed in June 2007 and experts from the
ministries of finance and budget and the central bank have designed a draft action plan,
which is awaiting approval and publication on the Ministry of Budget’s website.
As for the remaining structural agenda envisaged in the framework for 2007, my authorities
continue to make progress in its implementation and attribute the slow pace to capacity
problems. This remaining agenda includes notably: (i) the pursuit of the publication of
public-private partnership contracts, which has already started; (ii) the definitive adoption of
an action plan to contain the cost burden to the government of the merger of two banks
(Union des Banques Congolaises and Banque Congolaise); and (iii) the completion of the
audit of government expenditure for December 2006-February 2007 by the Cour des
Comptes.
ECONOMIC POLICIES AND STRUCTURAL MEASURES GOING FORWARD
My Congolese authorities will continue to act in accordance with the objectives laid out in
their program for 2007. They have set ambitious –yet realistic—macroeconomic objectives
for this year, notably reaching a real GDP growth of at least 6.5 percent (predicated on
improved performance in the mining, manufacturing, telecommunications and transportation
sectors). They also aim at reducing year-on-year inflation to 12 percent from 18 percent last
year through the pursuit of tight fiscal and monetary policies, the measures of which they are
already implementing.
More specifically, in the fiscal policy area, my Congolese authorities are set to implement
ambitious measures, especially in the areas of fighting tax evasion, reforming tax and
customs administrations, in order to further boost revenue. They are also aware of the
tremendous revenue potential from the mining sector, and steps are being taken to assess the
way forward to strengthen the collection of royalties and taxes in this sector. Over the
medium-term, my authorities intend to complement efforts in tax administration with tax

3
policy reforms, including the strict limitation of tax exemptions and the introduction of a
value-added tax (VAT). Fund technical assistance in this regard is required.
On the expenditure side, my authorities are giving priority to strengthening control on
current spending, including for political institutions and ministries. By further improving
public financial management (PFM), my authorities are determined to put an end to practices
that result in budget overruns, notably through a spending commitment plan and a treasury
cash flow plan published 10 days before the month they refer to. As for cash advances, these
are limited to budget-line items and renewed only if and after supporting documentation for
previous uses is submitted. Efforts are well underway to improve PFM and prioritize
expenditure so as to create the fiscal space needed to accommodate infrastructure and
poverty reduction demands.
My authorities are resisting pressures to substantially raise salaries in a country where these
have not been adjusted for a long time and teachers earn less than most civil servants. They
are committed to keeping the wage bill under control in 2007. Efforts towards budget control
over the medium to long term are also underway. These include a civil service census; an
action plan to strengthen management of the civil service; and extension of the simplified
transitional payroll to the rest of the civil service over the whole national territory by the end
of 2007. In the meantime, my authorities have instituted a freeze on hiring and budgeted
positions (except for education) until the overhaul of the payroll system has been completed.
The devolution policy mandated by the Constitution will be carefully implemented, so as to
ensure that macroeconomic stability is preserved. In this vein, the central government,
including recently at the highest level, maintains communication with the provincial
authorities to explain the need to build administrative and budgetary capacities in the
decentralized entities, put in place a system to monitor budget execution in the provinces, and
accompany resource transfers with well-defined transfers of responsibility and identification
of resources necessary to accomplish tasks.
Debt profile and management
In spite of gains from an overall improved security situation and from restored
macroeconomic stability and economic recovery, DRC’s debt distress continues to exert a
drag on the economy, a situation that calls for rapid progress towards the HIPC completion
point’s enhanced debt relief.
While cash flow problems prevented the DRC from servicing all its bilateral debt obligations
in the last 15 months, my authorities maintain communication with the Paris Club on
these difficulties. They reiterated their commitment to normalizing the country’s relations
with the Paris Club creditors as soon as the government’s financial situation allows it. They
also maintain dialogue with London and Kinshasa Clubs’ private creditors, with the view to

4
obtaining debt relief on comparable terms.
Monetary policy and the financial sector reform
With the end of fiscal overruns and the authorities’ firm commitment to avoid financing
deficits with money creation, the central bank will concentrate on its objectives of containing
inflation and building international reserves. Monetary policy will be made more proactive
through the implementation of the BCC’s program of reforms, with technical assistance of
the Fund. Reforms will, among others, make information on the central bank’s operations
more timely and more accurate, and enhance its capacities as cashier of the government and
for managing and forecasting bank liquidity. Making use of its treasury plan and the
recommendations of the organizational audit, the BCC will also make efforts to limit its
operating deficit to the planned cap for 2007.
On the financial sector, the central bank shares the view that priorities in addressing the
sector’s vulnerabilities, as depicted in the Selected Issues paper, should include the
completion of banks restructuring; increasing capital requirement and reinforcing compliance
with prudential standards to mitigate market risks, especially the foreign exchange risk;
improving regulation; strengthening on-site supervision; and enhancing competition, with the
view to deepen financial intermediation and improve the quality of services. The
microfinance sector carries a tremendous potential, and the BCC is compiling a
comprehensive database and is drafting a law to be submitted to Parliament in 2008.
Other structural reforms
My Congolese authorities are set to improve governance and the business environment, with
the view to attract investment and contribute to the development of the private sector. They
aim at a sustainable private sector-led growth, based on reconstruction activities as well
sectors with high potential, notably the water, electricity, transport, telecommunications and
mining sectors. In all these sectors, there is also considerable scope for large increase in
public investment in an environment of improved macroeconomic management. As regard
the mining sector, my authorities intend to meet the requirements of the Extractive Industries
Transparency Initiative (EITI).
Other structural reforms—some of which are used as structural benchmarks in the current
SMP—are being implemented. In particular, the government has started the publication, on
the finance ministry’s website, of public-private partnership contracts. The audit of
government spending between December 2006 and February 2007 by the Cour des Comptes
is also underway and the latter is expected to submit its final report this month after the
deadlines set forth in its procedural texts have been respected. Regarding the UBC/BC
merger, it is my authorities’ strong intention to limit to the maximum possible the
government’s burden in the takeover. In this vein, the authorities have requested experts to

5
verify the valuation of the UBC’s balance sheet, its outside balance-sheet loans and the rental
debt of the BC vis-à-vis the government. These expert missions have started in August 2007.
CONCLUSION
As a post-conflict country, the Democratic Republic of the Congo now faces an opportunity
to definitely consolidate peace and political stability as well as progress towards poverty
reduction and achieving the MDGs. However, this window of opportunity may be small. The
swift involvement of the Fund in 2002 has been instrumental to the progress made between
that year and late 2005. Prompt Fund assistance this time around, through a new PRGF
arrangement in support of the Congolese authorities’ ongoing efforts to maintain
macroeconomic stability, will enable them to mobilize donor support and attract private
investors, thereby helping put the country on a path of robust and sustained growth and
lasting poverty reduction.
