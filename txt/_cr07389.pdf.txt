Staff Report for the 2007 Article IV Consultation

Executive Summary
Background: Driven by massive capital inflows, the current-account deficit could
reach a record level of 20 percent of GDP in 2007. The external imbalance finances an
investment boom; private consumption, reflecting restrained fiscal and incomes
policies, has remained contained. Credit growth is also strong, but the largely foreignowned banking system seems well positioned to absorb adverse shocks. Headline
inflation has picked up sharply, mainly reflecting non-core inflation shocks, but wage
growth is also accelerating, owing to a tightening labor market. Pressures for large
public-sector wage hikes threaten to add to labor cost and inflation pressures.
Staff views: The main challenge is to maintain prudent fiscal and incomes policies to
avoid procyclical demand impulses. A stronger push on long-delayed structural
reforms, particularly reforms raising public sector efficiency, is also needed. Credit
portfolios should be monitored carefully, as present boom conditions may mask
underlying credit quality weaknesses. These policies should provide a solid basis for
sustaining the currency-board arrangement and achieving Bulgaria’s medium-term
ambition of accelerated real convergence and deeper EU integration, including through
euro adoption. At the same time, failure to keep fiscal and incomes policies in line with
the stringent requirements of the currency board could eventually result in a misaligned
real exchange rate, likely entailing an abrupt external adjustment or a prolonged period
of slow growth.
The authorities’ views: The authorities broadly agreed with the staff’s diagnosis and
policy proposals. They noted that they see no viable alternative to the currency board
arrangement. Policies would therefore have to remain consistent with sustaining
external competitiveness while increasing buffers against adverse shocks.

I. OVERVIEW
1.
The first Article IV Consultation following EU accession took place amid
growing concerns about Bulgaria’s external vulnerabilities. Bulgaria has achieved much
since the 1996–97 financial collapse: a currency board linked to the euro has anchored
stability-oriented fiscal and incomes policies; a largely foreign-owned modern banking
sector has developed from scratch; and EU accession has triggered a sweeping upgrade of
Bulgaria as an investment location. With Bulgaria’s economic policies broadly in line with
Fund advice (Box 1), the reward has been robust, albeit not spectacular, catch-up growth.
Accelerating sustainable real income convergence has to remain Bulgaria’s overriding
longer-term policy priority. However, massive and unexpectedly protracted capital inflows
have resulted in a soaring current-account deficit, raising more immediate concerns about
internal and external stability prospects, concerns accentuated by a recent raft of reports and
speeches belaboring the external vulnerabilities of high current-account deficit countries in
emerging Europe in general and Bulgaria in particular.

Box 1. Bulgaria’s Reactions to IMF Advice
Since the establishment of the currency board in 1997, Bulgaria has had an excellent
working relationship with the IMF. Policies have generally been consistent with IMF
recommendations, as reflected in the successful completion of a series of Stand-By
Arrangements. In particular, fiscal and incomes policies in recent years have responded
prudently to the widening external deficit. However, structural reforms that require strong
domestic consensus have tended to linger on the political backburner.

6
2.
The Article IV discussions focused on key policy requirements to contain and
manage Bulgaria’s external vulnerabilities and achieve deeper integration with the
EU. Notwithstanding Bulgaria’s often fractious and volatile politics, all main political
forces strongly and unequivocally support maintaining the currency board in the transition
to euro adoption, and policy requirements were discussed with this perspective in mind.
II. BACKGROUND
3.
Bulgaria’s already large external imbalance has continued to widen, and
underlying price pressures have picked up, although the economy’s internal imbalance
remains contained. Massive capital inflows, particularly foreign direct investment (FDI)
flows, are at the root of an unexpectedly persistent absorption (domestic demand) boom.
The widening gap between the economy’s absorption and GDP is reflected in a ballooning
current-account deficit, projected to reach

(HICP), surged into double digits, mainly
owing to food- and energy-price shocks.
4.
Bulgaria’s absorption boom reflects largely a private investment boom. The
changes in savings-investment balances during 2004–06 indicate that the foreign-savings
influx has financed a boom in private investment. The private investment-GDP ratio surged
well above its historical average, while the private consumption-GDP ratio remained close
to average (Figure 1). Thus, private consumption has not been a driver of Bulgaria’s

With EU accession, collection of data on trade with EU countries shifted to the Intrastat System, a regime
change that could have resulted in moderate downward bias in preliminary 2007 export data (Appendix IV).

absorption boom, a conclusion also consistent with an only moderate pickup in imported
consumer goods. Moreover, growing fiscal surpluses have accompanied the private sector’s
widening financial deficits, indicating that fiscal policy was also not an absorption-boom
driver (Table 5). While Bulgaria’s absorption boom shares similarities with recent trends in
the Baltic countries and Romania, Bulgaria’s relatively favorable combination of large FDI
inflows, low exposures of banks to mortgages, and prudent fiscal and incomes policies stands
out (Figure 2).

Bulgaria’s private investment boom likely reflects a one-off re-assessment of
the country as an investment location.2 The currency board has locked in relatively low
risk-free real interest rates, but these low rates can not fully explain the observed investment
boom. Prices of financial and real assets—including sovereign bonds, equity, real estate—

risks, particularly the security of property rights in the nontradables sectors, largely faded
once EU accession was secured. In fact, recent FDI has been mainly absorbed by the
nontradables sectors, raising concerns about Bulgaria’s export prospects. However,
globalization has rendered the conventional distinction between tradables and nontradables
sectors increasingly blurry. Moreover, the share of real investment—as opposed to FDI—in
Bulgaria’s tradables sectors has remained broadly unchanged.

Box 2. Bulgaria: Inputs for External Stability Risk Assessment 1/
Staff estimates of the equilibrium current-account deficit center around 8 percent of GDP:
•

The macroeconomic balance approach, based on panel data for 38 industrial and transition
countries for 1992–2006, suggests that Bulgaria’s current-account deficit norm is
somewhat above 5 percent of GDP. However, this estimate is backward-looking and might
underestimate the sustainable current-account deficit in a setting of globalized financial
markets and EU convergence.

•

External sustainability considerations based on stabilizing the net international investment
position (IIP) at a medium-term level of about 80 percent of GDP, but ignoring EU capital
grants, point to a sustainable current-account deficit of about 8 percent of GDP.

•

Bulgaria is likely to receive EU capital grants amounting to about 2 percent of GDP, and
the sustainable current-account deficit could be correspondingly higher as these grants will
not add to Bulgaria’s external liabilities.

Notwithstanding the presently large current-account deficit relative to equilibrium, the real
effective exchange rate appears fairly valued (Box Figure):
•

Different measures of Bulgaria’s real effective exchange rate have all appreciated over
recent years, but the pace of appreciation has been in line with experiences in other
transition economies.

•

Purchasing-power-parity and dollar wage-cost comparisons in industry across countries
also yield no strong evidence of overvaluation.

•

Estimates of the real equilibrium exchange rate (CPI based) as a function of relative
productivity and the net foreign asset position during 1996–2006 indicate that the actual
real exchange rate has appreciated largely in line with the estimated equilibrium real
exchange rate.

•

Recent export volume growth (11 percent during 2004-06) remained solid, and export
market shares have increased in all major export destinations. However, a constant market
share analysis at SITC 1-digit product level indicates some erosion of competitiveness
relative to other low- and middle-income countries during 2004–05, albeit coming on the
back of large gains during 2001–03.

Domestic bank credit has started to boom again, but the banking sector
maintains significant buffers against a credit-cycle downturn. Since administrative limits
on bank credit lapsed at end-2006, credit growth has accelerated to over 50 percent
(Tables 6-7). In response, in September 2007 the BNB raised reserve requirements from
8 to 12 percent, noting that it would be ready to adopt additional measures to moderate credit
growth if needed. Financial soundness indicators continue to suggest that the largely foreignowned banking sector remains well capitalized and profitable (Figure 4, Table 8).
Nonperforming loan ratios remain low, though this partly reflects rapid loan portfolio
growth. Moreover, banks’ exposures to the booming real estate market are still limited, as
purchases by nonresidents have been the key market driver.
9.
Global credit fears have so far had moderate effects on Bulgaria. Since late July,
sovereign-bond spreads and credit-default swap rates have widened, albeit from a very low
base and mirroring developments in other vulnerable transition economies (Figure 5). Local
interbank markets, which are small, have been volatile but followed trends in euro markets.

The private investment boom has provided surprisingly little boost to
Bulgaria’s growth performance, but the growth payoff may be underestimated or come
with delay.3 Official figures indicate steady GDP growth at about 6 percent over recent

Labor market slack is being eliminated at a rapid clip. Unemployment has
plummeted, but Bulgaria’s employment rate remains relatively low (Figure 6). Public-sector
employment has been cut back significantly, while private-sector employment has expanded
considerably. Nominal wage growth, which was subdued in recent years, has accelerated
across sectors, with the private sector in the lead.4
12.
Inflationary pressures are building up. Recent increases in headline HICP
inflation reflect in large part one-off effects from the summer drought, EU accession on food
prices, and higher global energy prices (Figure 7). Money growth has been restrained by de
facto sterilization through the government’s build-up of a large fiscal reserve in the central
bank (Table 6). But core inflation has picked up in response to rising labor cost, albeit at a
much slower pace than headline inflation. Reflecting recent steady GDP growth, overall
capacity pressures—as indicated by the small estimated output gap (some 1 percent
in 2007)—remain still moderate.
13.
The fiscal policy stance has been broadly neutral over recent years. Since 2004,
fiscal policy has achieved progressively larger surpluses, mainly as the result of unspent
revenue windfalls associated with the absorption boom. Staff calculations of the hypothetical
fiscal balance that would obtain when the economy returns to internal and external balance
suggest that the present underlying fiscal position is likely close to balance. Thus, the
budgeted fiscal surplus of ¾ percent of GDP for 2007 was based on highly conservative
revenue projections (Table 5). Notwithstanding recent decisions to raise (effective October 1)
pensions by an additional 10 percent and cut the social contribution rate by 3 percentage
points, the surplus is likely to reach 3½ percent of GDP. Reflecting the prudent fiscal policy
stance, Bulgaria’s general government balance sheet is strong, with gross public debt
(about 20 percent of GDP) and other liabilities more than offset by the fiscal reserve and
other assets.

However, Bulgaria’s labor market data need to be interpreted with caution as increases in both employment
and wage growth could partly reflect a shrinking grey economy.

Tackling key structural reforms has proven difficult, given fragile party politics
and entrenched special interests. Bulgaria’s scope for sustainable real convergence
depends ultimately on raising the productivity of human and real resources (Figure 8).5
Progress on structural reforms is at par with peers in areas where EU legislation tends to
enforce regulatory homogeneity, including on price liberalization, trade, and the foreign
exchange system (Table 9). However, where EU accession has provided only a weak reform
anchor, progress has been slow:
•

The public sector’s efficiency is low, as reflected in indicators for corruption, red
tape, quality of judiciary, education standards, and other performance measures.

•

Businesses face costly administrative burdens, particularly the still complex
registration system.

•

Rigidities in the labor market hinder the reallocation of labor, particularly from lowto higher-productivity sectors, and there is a question whether the labor market could
deliver the degree of wage flexibility needed to support the currency board under
adverse shock scenarios.
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS

15.
Bulgaria’s challenge is to maintain policies that will facilitate restoring external
balance without a crisis, preserve internal balance in the face of growing inflation
pressures, and achieve more rapid convergence growth. The discussions focused on:
•
What is the appropriate fiscal and incomes policy framework in Bulgaria’s setting of
an unsustainable absorption boom?
•
What financial-sector policies could help insure against a possible hard landing given
rapid credit growth and external vulnerabilities, both in the short and medium terms?
•
What structural reforms could foster sustainable convergence growth and increase the
economy’s robustness to external shocks, given the currency-board constraint on relative
price adjustment?

A. Outlook and External Stability Risks
16.
There was agreement that a soft landing remains a viable baseline mediumterm scenario. In this baseline scenario, the external environment, including global growth,
remains favorable, and capital inflows normalize as excess-return investment opportunities
are exhausted, entailing sharply slowing investment spending and imports over the medium
term (Table 10a). Absorption growth would gradually decline below GDP growth, lowering
the current-account deficit to about 8 percent of GDP, broadly consistent with staff’s
estimates of Bulgaria’s equilibrium current-account balance (Box 2). After the sharp increase
this year, inflation is projected to recede gradually to some 3½ percent as the absorption
boom dissipates, with lower inflation underpinned by stability-oriented fiscal and incomes
policies, low import-price inflation, as well as steady progress on closing structural-reform
gaps. External competitiveness would be preserved, with the real effective exchange rate
appreciating in line with medium-term fundamentals, consistent with a sustainable currency
board.
17.
But the economy would remain saddled with significant external balance-sheet
vulnerabilities. The net IIP would deteriorate further, albeit at a slowing pace, stabilizing at
some 80 percent of GDP by 2012 (Table 10a). Gross external debt would only stabilize at
about 93 percent of GDP, requiring the medium-term current-account deficit excluding
interest payments to shrink to some 4 percent of GDP (Appendix I). Such a legacy of high
external indebtedness would markedly increase Bulgaria’s vulnerability to future adverse
shocks, particularly if euro adoption were delayed beyond 2012. Moreover, the coverage of
the current-account deficit by net FDI inflows is projected to decline to half its present level
over the medium term, although coverage of short-term debt by international reserves would
remain above 100 percent.
18.
Thus, staff cautioned that a soft landing may not necessarily materialize, even
under prudent policies. Given already significant external balance-sheet vulnerabilities, if
in addition the investment boom reflects irrational exuberance with respect to expected risks
and returns, a possible correction of capital and credit flows could be sharp and sudden,
mimicking a boom-bust cycle. The authorities noted that as long as policies remain prudent,
Bulgaria’s vulnerabilities, including in the corporate sector, would be well matched by the
large precautionary buffers built up in the balance sheets of the central bank, the government,
and the banking system. The authorities also emphasized, and staff agreed, that the analytical
and empirical understanding of what drives Bulgaria’s high external deficits remains
imperfect, adding that gloomy snap judgments based on historical analogies, including
the 1990s Asian crisis, could be quite misleading.
19.
There was agreement that a significant deviation from prudent fiscal and
incomes policies could easily result in a misaligned real exchange rate, likely putting the
currency board under stress. Under this alternative scenario, public-sector wages could be
hiked well above productivity trends, in turn boosting private sector wages, and, with a lag,

23
social benefits, with the fiscal stance turning sharply expansionary (Table 10b, Figure 9).
Rising labor cost would feed into higher domestic inflation, external cost and price
competitiveness would deteriorate, undermining the tradables sectors’ ability to export and to
compete with imports. A consumption-driven boom in nontradables activities could
overcompensate for a slump in the tradables sectors, resulting in temporarily higher GDP
growth. However, on the external side, the nominal exchange-rate constraint imposed by the
currency board would result in a significantly overvalued real exchange rate. Such a scenario
could either entail an abrupt external adjustment or a prolonged period of slow growth to
restore external competitiveness.
20.
Early euro adoption remains the authorities’ umbrella objective. The immediate
goal is joining ERM2, and, to facilitate this, the authorities noted that they are willing to
provide firm and detailed policy commitments to their European partners. While the
authorities aim to adopt the euro on a fast-track basis after ERM2 entry, they also recognized
that the road to euro adoption could be prolonged and difficult, with the Maastricht Treaty’s
low-inflation criterion presenting an especially formidable hurdle.
B. Fiscal Policy
21.
The authorities are strongly committed to a fiscal framework that avoids
procyclical policies and restructures the budget to accelerate real income convergence:
•

Fiscal balance targets: The strategy would be to maintain a broadly balanced
structural fiscal position over the medium term. Staff noted that this would strike a
good compromise between the fiscal prudence requirements of a currency board and
Bulgaria’s unfavorable demographics on the one hand, and the large spending
requirements of a lagging transition economy on the other.

•

Expenditure policies: The
medium-term expenditureGDP ratio would be kept
below 40 percent of GDP,
well below spending levels
of many EU peers. The
public sector’s lagging
efficiency calls for
designing action plans for
reviewing spending and
programs in key budgetary
sectors, notably education
and health care. Moreover,
with support from EU
grants, the spending
structure would be

1/ The alternative scenario assumes loose incomes and fiscal policies relative to the baseline scenario.
Specifically, compared with the baseline, average norminal wage growth is about 14 percentage points higher
during 2008–12, mainly driven by rapid wage increases in the public sector.

25
shifted toward public infrastructure and human capital formation to accelerate real
convergence.
•

Revenue policies: The tax structure has already undergone a welcome shift toward
indirect taxation. The authorities plan to continue to reduce direct tax rates,
particularly on labor, while broadening tax bases to combat the grey economy and to
increase further Bulgaria’s attractiveness as an investment location. Staff cautioned
that the recent surge in the tax-GDP ratio is likely to prove temporary and noted that
the recent steep cuts in social contribution rates already require substantial budget
transfers to keep the pay-as-you-go pension system afloat.

22.
In line with this framework, staff urged the authorities to allow automatic fiscal
stabilizers to operate fully during the remainder of 2007. With revenues potentially even
more buoyant than presently projected, pressures to increase spending further should be
resisted given rising inflationary pressures.
23.
Fiscal plans for 2008 envisage a broadly neutral stance, but sticking to this
prudent stance could prove an uphill battle. The authorities noted that running large fiscal
surpluses was increasingly seen as a sign of excessive fiscal austerity by many stakeholders
given the country’s large social needs. Nevertheless, the 2008 draft budget approved by the
cabinet projects a surplus of 3 percent of GDP, roughly in line with an unchanged fiscal
stance. However, staff saw several risks and issues:
•

Wages: Following a protracted strike, teachers were granted a wage increase of about
45 percent. Assuming there are no further public-sector strikes ending with similar
hikes, average budget wages are still projected to increase by 16 percent. The
authorities plan to limit the wage-bill impact of higher wages by stepping up cuts in
public employment, but admitted that this could prove difficult.

•

Personal income tax: The draft 2008 budget envisages a flat 10 percent personal
income tax (a 10 percent corporate tax rate is already in place), while eliminating
most exemptions to broaden the tax base. Staff estimated the likely revenue loss to
amount to some ½ percent of GDP and suggested compensating measures, including
by raising real-estate taxation. However, the authorities believe that revenue losses
will be smaller because the flat tax will help shrink the grey economy, and higher
excises on tobacco and fuel will partly compensate for revenue losses.

•

Capital budget: The draft budget projects capital spending to rise to about 7 percent
of GDP in 2008, up from 6 percent of GDP in 2007, financed by a similar increase in
EU grants. Staff expressed concern that increased infrastructure spending could add
undesirable demand impulses to an already overheated construction sector, but the
authorities noted that there were early signs of slowing residential construction
outside Sofia freeing up capacity.

26
24.
The authorities highlighted substantial progress on improving fiscal
transparency. The 2008 draft budget will be based on a single surplus target during budget
preparation and authorization. Moreover, the previous practice of across-the-board spending
sequestration depending on fiscal or external developments will be discontinued, and a
contingency reserve will instead be included in the 2008 budget. Staff noted that it will be
important to establish clear and transparent rules for the use of this contingency reserve.

account.
26.
The authorities agreed that rapid bank credit growth warrants careful
monitoring. The authorities envisage prudent implementation of Basel II, notably keeping
the minimum capital-adequacy ratio at 12 percent, the highest ratio among new member
states, and maintaining the standardized approach until sufficient data are available to allow
fact-based internal ratings. However, bank credit growth was uncomfortably high, and may
partly reflect the objective of large banks to maintain or expand market share. Against this
backdrop, the authorities are re-evaluating banks’ internal risk-management systems. They
have also strengthened cross-border cooperation with parent supervisors of foreign banks,
and intended to become active participants in future EU financial stability coordination
exercises.7

Capital market development faces significant local challenges. There is
undoubtedly scope for expanding the role of local private debt and stock markets in
financial intermediation (Figure 10). The key incentives for raising funds in the domestic
capital market are reducing maturity mismatch and reliance on foreign funding in the
banking sector. Though nonfinancial enterprises were not expected to become major local
bond issuers in the short term, the recent rise in local initial public offerings indicates that
they are increasingly turning to the stock market for capital. Against this backdrop, the
authorities shared staff’s concern that a potentially large stock-market correction could be
damaging for market development, given reputational costs and the adverse consequences
for pension-fund performance.
D. Structural Reforms
28.
Improving the business climate and enhancing wage and labor market
flexibility were seen as priorities. A key step to improving the business climate will be the
start-up of the electronic commercial register on January 1, 2008, and the authorities plan to
further simplify licensing and permit systems. More progress on privatization, including of
Bulgartabak Holding AD, and improving market competition, particularly in energy
markets, were also priorities. In the labor market, limited intersectoral mobility in particular
called for amending the overly prescriptive Labor Code to provide social partners with more
flexibility to set wages, benefits, seniority bonuses, and overtime and part-time work.
Improving incentives for education and training, as well as putting limits on the duration of
social benefits to stimulate work effort, were seen as additional useful steps to improve
labor-market functioning.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
29.
At first sight, Bulgaria’s economy is performing quite well. Since 2003, against a
backdrop of increasingly secure EU accession prospects and impressive macroeconomic
stability gains, investment spending has boomed as investors sought to take advantage of
Bulgaria’s improved economic fundamentals. Official data suggest that real GDP growth
averaged about 6 percent during 2003–06, while unemployment dropped sharply.
30.
But Bulgaria’s policy makers are faced with several disquieting developments.
The current-account deficit has ballooned to unprecedented levels. It will have to be
reduced eventually, otherwise the country’s external net financial liabilities and payment
obligations could increase to unsustainable levels. Moreover, the recent credit tensions in
mature markets have highlighted the speed and scope at which financial markets can reassess risk premia, and Bulgaria is widely viewed as vulnerable to such re-assessments.
Adding to external concerns, inflationary pressures are also on the rise, in large part
reflecting one-off shocks, but also accelerating wage increases as labor market conditions
have tightened. Finally, much needed but difficult structural reforms were put on the

29
backburner for too long, particularly reforms that would raise the public sector’s low
efficiency.
31.
This challenging backdrop calls for maintaining a prudent policy framework
while tackling difficult structural reforms. Fiscal and incomes policies should continue to
avoid adding procyclical demand pressures that could widen internal and external
imbalances, while retooling the spending and tax levers of the budget to accelerate real
convergence and productivity growth, including through the efficient absorption of EU
funds. Banking supervisors should closely monitor banks’ risk management and ensure that
banks’ have sufficient buffers to absorb large adverse shocks. And long-delayed structural
reforms are needed to raise the efficiency of available human and real resources, while
providing incentives to add to available resources. These policies should also provide a
strong basis for achieving Bulgaria’s ambition for deepening its EU integration, including
by eventually adopting the euro.
32.
Prudent fiscal and incomes policies remain the authorities first line of defense.
The authorities have accumulated an admirable record in allowing automatic fiscal
stabilizers to feed through to large fiscal surpluses. But prudent fiscal and incomes policies
need to be upheld to preserve the sustainability of the currency board, notwithstanding
popular sentiments that present budget surpluses are excessive and that the public purse
strings should be loosened to address high social expectations following EU accession.
Therefore, the authorities’ intention to aim at a large budget surplus in 2008 is welcome.
But it will also be important to maintain wage discipline in the public sector, and
compensate already agreed large increases in public wages partly by stepping up reductions
in public-sector employment. This would also help mitigate overheating pressures in the
labor market. The envisaged steps to increase fiscal transparency in the 2008 budget are
also welcome.
33.
Banking sector supervision and regulation is strong, and financial soundness
indicators do not point to glaring weaknesses, but arrangements have yet to be tested
by a credit-cycle downturn. Basel II capital-adequacy standards apply since January and
should help encourage more risk-based management of credit portfolios. Moreover, with
Bulgaria’s foreign banks increasingly centralizing their liquidity and risk management
functions, cross-border cooperation with other supervisors needs to be strengthened further.
Finally, Bulgaria’s active participation in future efforts to improve the EU’s cross-border
crisis management arrangements is welcome.
34.
Notwithstanding major achievements, capital market regulation and
supervision needs further strengthening to support sustainable market development.
The authorities have adopted relevant EU directives and made significant efforts to increase
transparency and financial disclosure standards. To reduce the potential for boom-bust
cycles in local asset prices, the authorities should further increase efforts to enforce
regulations, educate the public about stock market risks, and consider tighter listing

30
requirements in the local stock market. The planned FSAP update in 2008 should provide a
good opportunity to take stock of the strengths and vulnerabilities of Bulgaria’s financial
system.
35.
Several structural reform priorities should be addressed without delay. First,
public-sector efficiency should be raised, starting by designing action plans for reviewing
spending and programs in key budget sectors, notably education and health care. It would
also be useful to introduce effective systems for monitoring and evaluating policy
implementation in the public sector. As regards the labor market, measures to activate labor
supply should include amendments to the Labor Code to provide more flexibility to social
partners to negotiate the terms of work contracts. Finally, there is a need to improve the
investment climate by lowering the cost of doing business.
36.
While Bulgaria’s statistical data are broadly adequate for surveillance, there
are significant weaknesses. The sectoral flow-of-funds data for households and
nonfinancial corporates are sketchy, impeding the understanding of vulnerabilities in these
sectors. Bulgaria’s employment and wage data are also difficult to interpret, partly
reflecting difficult-to-measure changes in the grey economy. And given the focus on
Bulgaria’s widening external imbalance, clarification of uncertainties regarding the trade
data that have emerged since EU accession would be desirable.
37.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12-month
cycle.

APPENDIX III. BULGARIA: IMF-WORLD BANK RELATIONS
A. Partnership in Bulgaria’s Development Strategy
1.
The World Bank has been leading the policy dialogue in structural and institutional
reforms aimed at Bulgaria’s successful EU integration and convergence. On June 13, 2006
the Board of Directors discussed the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) of the Bank which
outlined the roadmap for the Bank’s country support for the period FY07-09. The strategic
priorities of the CPS focus on: (i) productivity and employment; (ii) fiscal sustainability and
absorption of EU funds; and (iii) social inclusion. In addition to the Bank’s ongoing lending
operations in areas such as revenue administration, health, social investment and employment
promotion, district heating, and environment, the CPS includes a three-year program of three
development policy loans (DPLs) of up to US$150 million each that will support institutional
reforms in the social sectors. In addition, the CPS program includes a pipeline of investment
lending in road and municipal infrastructure, trade and transport facilitation for South East
Europe, social inclusion, and regional development. The Bank continues to undertake
diagnostics providing a solid base for policy dialogue and design and implementation of its
lending operations in Bulgaria.
B. IMF-World Bank Collaboration in Specific Areas
2.
The Bank has the lead on the dialogue on the core structural aspects of the reforms
while the Fund has the lead on the dialogue on the macroeconomic, in particular fiscal and
financial sector, aspects of the reforms. The IMF leads in the areas of macroeconomic
stability, fiscal, income, and external sector policies, and its analyses serve as inputs into
World Bank policy formulation and advice. The Bank and the Fund share responsibility in
the financial sector, public expenditure management and budgeting, and tax administration.
B.1.

Areas of shared responsibility.

3.
Financial Sector. In late 2001, staff of the two institutions carried out a joint IMFWorld Bank Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) for Bulgaria, providing a shared
perspective on the development agenda of the country and on the prioritization and
sequencing of reforms in the financial sector. Key findings of the FSAP have been used as
conditionalities on financial sector policies under both the SBA and the PAL program. A
follow-up to the FSAP was undertaken by Fund staff in the context of the 2004 Article IV
consultation mission in March–April 2004 and an update is scheduled for 2008.
4.
Revenue Administration. Joint World Bank-IMF efforts led to the Revenue
Administration Reform Project (€31.9 million), approved by the Bank’s Board in 2003,
under which the new National Revenue Agency became operational on January 1, 2006,
integrating collection of tax and social security revenues and establishing an economically
efficient public revenue collection system that facilitates private sector development and
complies with EU requirements.

50
5.
Public Expenditure Management. The Bank has taken the lead in the dialogue on
the efficiency and effectiveness of public expenditures and has outlined policy directions in
the context of the Public Expenditure and Institutional Review1 of 2002, and the Public
Finance Policy Review2 of 2006, and a forthcoming second Public Finance Policy Review.
B.2. Areas where the World Bank leads and its analyses serve as inputs into the IMF
policy formulation and advice.
6.
Education. The Bank has supported the government program in education. The first
DPL, which was approved by the Bank’s Board in March 2007, supports the deepening of
education reforms, in particular strengthening of the institutional capacity of the Ministry of
Education and Sciences to assess the quality of education, and improve school governance
and financing system. In addition, a second Public Finance Policy Review, that is currently
being finalized, outlines options for reforms aimed at improving quality of vocational
education and training as well as the quality of and access to tertiary education.
7.
Health. The Bank has supported the government program in health through two
investment operations and the DPL program. The Bank’s first DPL focused on strengthening
the financial sustainability of the national health insurance system and enhancing the
efficiency of public spending on pharmaceuticals.
8.
Social protection programs. Social protection programs—pensions, labor market
programs, social assistance, and short-term and family benefits—have a wide coverage
among the population. The Bank’s first DPL supports an employment promotion program,
which includes interventions to alter incentives both on the labor supply and the labor
demand sides. To create additional incentives for job searching and lower reliance of ablebodied individuals on social welfare programs, the government will change eligibility criteria
of some social assistance programs.
9.
The Bank has embarked on a multi-year poverty monitoring program aimed at
assessing the impact of government policies and economic growth on the poor. This work
will also provide a feedback loop so that policy adjustments can be made as appropriate to
take account of findings. In addition, the Bank and government are preparing a Social

C. The World Bank Group Strategy and Lending Operations
10.
The Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Bulgaria3, discussed by the Bank’s
Board on June 13, 2006, focused on three main themes: (i) productivity and employment, (ii)
fiscal sustainability and absorption of EU funds, and (iii) social inclusion.
11.
The World Bank’s assistance program in Bulgaria to date comprises 41 IBRD
operations with a total original commitment of US$2,314 million equivalent, consisting
of 13 adjustment loans (US$1,225.8 million), 21 investment projects (US$750.7 million), one
debt reduction loan (US$125.0 million), four Bank-managed Global Environmental Fund
(GEF) grants, and two Bank-managed Prototype Carbon Fund (PCF) operations. Of these 41
operations, 29 have been completed, of which eleven have been partially cancelled during
implementation, and 11 operations are currently under implementation (see Table 1 below).

investment climate assessment.
13.
IFC, as of July 2007, has 12 projects in its portfolio with total commitments of
US$204 million for its own account and an additional US$60 syndicated from partner
banks. In the financial sector, IFC has supported two specialized SME banks, established
Bulgaria’s first micro lending bank, and has invested in a venture capital fund that also
targets the SME sector. IFC has invested in a number of key manufacturing projects to
support a cement plant modernization, the expansion and modernization of an electronic
assembly facility, the rehabilitation and capacity increase of a wood panel production facility,
revamping of a copper processing facility, and a project in retail sector to establish discount
stores, hypermarkets and distribution centers in the country. As a good example of SouthSouth investments, IFC has committed about US$90 million to support post-privatization
restructuring of a steel mill and two glass processing plants.

APPENDIX IV: BULGARIA: STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
Data provision is adequate for surveillance purposes. In January 2003, an STA
mission visited Bulgaria and prepared the data module of the Report on the Observance of
Standards and Codes (ROSC). Later that year, Bulgaria moved from participation in the
GDDS to SDDS subscription, marking a major step forward in the development of the
country's statistical system.
2.
Despite a comprehensive database, some problems need to be addressed. Further
improvements in national accounts are desirable, particularly in the coverage of the private
sector, as well as in the balance of payments statistics, where frequent and substantial
revisions have hampered economic analysis. In addition, work remains to be done to fully
reconcile high frequency data on economic activity with quarterly and annual national
accounts data. Moreover, to enhance assessments of economic developments and
vulnerabilities, it would be desirable to develop sectoral flow-of-funds accounts for the
household sector and, in particular, for the non-financial corporation sector, improve the
quality of employment and wage data, and clarify uncertainties regarding trade data that have
emerged since EU accession.
Real sector
3.
The National Statistical Institute (NSI) is responsible for compiling national accounts,
based on a system consistent with the System of National Accounts 1993 (SNA 1993) and the
European System of Accounts 1995. GDP data by activity and expenditure categories are
compiled and reconciled within an annual supply and use framework. However, government
output and final consumption are estimated on a cash basis. In addition, published national
accounts include current and capital accounts for the five main domestic sectors (general
government, financial corporations, nonfinancial corporations, nonprofit institutions serving
households, and households). Work is underway on compiling financial accounts and balance
sheets.
4.
The NSI has compiled estimates of quarterly GDP by the production and expenditure
approaches in current and constant prices since 1994. The preliminary data are disseminated
80 days after the end of the reference quarter with final figures disseminated after
approximately 5 quarters. Problems remain in the coverage of private sector activities as well
as regarding constant price estimates of capital formation and external trade. However,
significant progress has been made in the development of export and import deflators. The
estimates at constant prices, which follow international standards, use chain-linked indices.
5.
On price data, the NSI produces a domestic consumer price index (CPI), a
harmonized consumer price index (HICP) according to Eurostat methods, and a producer
price index (PPI). All are updated monthly. The CPI series begins in 1995, the PPI in 2000
and the HCPI in 2005 (for earlier years it is set equal to the CPI). The coverage of the CPIs
was extended, although they still exclude some important sectors, mainly owner-occupied

54
housing and health and life insurance. Since 2004 financial services are included. The
geographical coverage of the index is restricted to 27 urban areas which account for an
estimated 65 percent of sales.
6.
The flow of customs data has improved significantly in recent years and a new system
for processing customs records is near completion. The development of export and import
unit value indices is progressing smoothly and additional support is expected from Eurostat
in this area. The current indices are used as deflators for the import and export components of
the national accounts. The Import and Export Division of the NSI meets monthly with the
BNB to review data issues and ensure consistency between the NSI export and import data
and the balance of payments data.
7.
The lack of comprehensive labor statistics hampers the assessment of developments
in employment and wages, especially in the private sector, though there have been some
recent improvements. Annual data are collected by the NSI, using a census of all
establishments. The NSI also obtains current monthly estimates from a quarterly survey of
establishments using all public enterprises and a sample of private employers that excludes
establishments with less than five employees. The sample included 14,500 private employers
out of approximately 142,000 qualifying private enterprises. The main shortcomings of these
data include: (i) under-reporting of private sector wages; (ii) reporting of average gross
earnings only, not wages for time worked and wages by occupation; and (iii) lack of
coverage of the self-employed and employment in small firms. However, the National Social
Security Institute (NSSI) administrative data are used to estimate wages by occupation and
age and the number of self-employed and employment in small firms. The household budget
survey could provide an alternative source of data for private sector wages. Regarding
employment, the NSI household labor force survey is an alternative source of data, but
improvements are needed to make it more consistent with the establishment survey,
especially regarding agricultural employment. The survey is conducted four times a year.
8.
A Population Census was conducted in early 2001 and is a source for redesigning the
household surveys conducted by the NSI, particularly the household budget survey and the
labor force survey.
Government finance
9.
In recent years, following the recommendations of a combined STA/FAD mission
and within the framework of fiscal reporting requirements for EU accession, the authorities
have made significant progress on implementing accrual accounting for government,
budgetary and statistical systems. Consolidated data on central government operations are
routinely reported for publication in the GFS Yearbook and in IFS. For the GFS
Yearbook 2006, 2005 data for the general government sector and its subsectors were reported
on a cash basis. The Ministry of Finance prepares data on the execution of the consolidated
government budget on a monthly basis. These data do not conform to GFS standards and,

55
while not published in a bulletin format, they are posted on the Ministry of Finance’s
website. The authorities have made progress in presenting data on a disaggregated basis,
including expenditure by functional classification. In addition, a full economic classification
of expenditure is now available, and the authorities have provided such data on an annual
basis back to 1998.
Money and banking statistics
10.
In 2002, the BNB began to harmonize progressively its data collection and
compilation methods in line with the ECB’s framework for monetary statistics. The revised
data for June 1995 and onward resulting from these efforts are published in IFS. Recent work
in mid-2006 aimed at fully meeting the remaining ECB requirements beginning in
February 2007, in accordance with 1995 ESA, the institutional coverage of monetary
financial institutions includes money market funds. Consistency in the coverage of the
BNB’s claims on banks (which included claims on liquidated banks) and the banks’
liabilities to the BNB improved in January 2003 after the BNB wrote off most of the claims
on the liquidated banks.
Balance of payments
11.
Bulgaria reports monthly balance of payments and external debt data on a regular
and timely basis, but data on reinvested earnings by foreign-owned companies are subject to
large revisions due to incomplete responses on surveys used for preliminary estimates. In
early 2006, the authorities revised the methodology for estimating trade-related
transportation receipts and payments to align it more closely with actual costs. Since joining
the EU in January 2007, the trade data with EU countries are being collected following the
INTRASTAT system. The new system has created considerable data uncertainties as
40 percent of those who reported trade data for the first half of the year reported a value of
zero. The authorities therefore expect that some revisions in the 2007 trade data later in the
year will be needed as more complete information becomes available.

Statement by Age Bakker, Executive Director for Bulgaria
and Victor Yotzov, Advisor to Executive Director
December 17, 2007
The Bulgarian authorities appreciate the continued constructive dialogue with the
management and staff that has been extremely helpful over the last decade. Over that period,
Bulgaria has implemented a comprehensive reform agenda and successfully completed
several Fund-supported programs that helped the country to stabilize and make progress in
the run-up to the EU accession. Decisive reforms and continued prudent macroeconomic
policy eventually paid off – as of the beginning of 2007, Bulgaria is a full-fledged member of
the EU.
For the years to come, Bulgaria’s overriding policy priority remains speeding up real
convergence and raising living standards. Notwithstanding the enormous progress made in
this direction over the last years, important challenges remain as external imbalances proved
persistent along with higher than expected inflationary pressures. Against this background,
the authorities remain committed to achieving high and sustainable economic growth while
maintaining a stable and predictable macroeconomic environment. With a view to the
fulfillment of this objective, keeping public finances in check is regarded crucial. The
government intends to keep running budget surpluses to help curb domestic demand as well
as to moderate the external account imbalance.
Recent developments
The confidence inspired by the good economic performance over the last several
years, as well as the recent accession to the EU, has continued to attract substantial amounts
of capital inflows, mostly in the form of FDI. As a result, real GDP has accelerated in the
first half of 2007 to 6.4 percent, led primarily by fixed capital investment and to a much
lesser extent by private consumption. It is widely expected that this trend will hold
throughout the year, and the previously expected growth rate of 6 percent for the year as a
whole will most likely be exceeded. The current pattern of growth has been repeatedly
observed over the last years. The private investment-to-GDP ratio has been surging, while
the private consumption-to GDP ratio remains broadly stable, suggesting that consumption
has not been the main driver of recent high growth rates. Such a conclusion is also supported
by the structure of imports, that shows a growing share of investment goods and a broadly
stable share of consumer goods.
Inflation has picked up in 2007, reflecting to a large extent one-off factors caused by
a severe summer draught that triggered a significant increase in food prices. This came on top
of a more general increase in food prices that has been observed in other countries in the
region and elsewhere, prompting a possible price correction. After the summer shock, during
which CPI increased by almost 7 percent, conditions are now expected to return to normal,
while the disinflationary momentum is expected to gain strength. Nevertheless, headline
inflation in 2007 is expected to exceed earlier projections. Core inflation, however, has
picked up at a significantly slower pace, reflecting a modest rise in labor cost and only
limited overall capacity pressures.

2

On the back of strong growth, liberalized market conditions, and overall positive
expectations, employment has been on an upward trend for the last couple of years.
Accordingly, the unemployment rate has fallen (and continues to fall) considerably from
about 20 percent in 2000 to less than 7 percent now. As parliament has recently passed
amendments to the Labor Code to increase working time flexibility, it is expected that
employment, which is still below the average of Bulgaria’s peers, will continue to rise.
Buoyant economic growth, steady capital inflows, and a prudent fiscal policy with
sizable surpluses over the last four years, resulted in a significant increase of the Fiscal
Reserve Account. Accumulated reserves were used to buy back and retire all outstanding
Brady bonds, to make early repurchases to all outstanding loans to the Fund, as well as to
prepay a portion of World Bank loans. These prepayments have contributed to significantly
lowering the external public debt ratio, which is expected to fall below 15 percent of GDP by
the end 2007. Gross external debt, however, has been on the rise since 2003 as the private
sector debt has begun to grow rapidly, in line with the investment boom that the country has
been experiencing. This trend is expected to reverse in a couple of years, along with an
overall moderation of capital inflows. Meanwhile, external debt indicators show that risks are
fairly contained as short-term debt is fully covered by reserves. Moreover, a significant part
of the private external debt (more than one third) is in fact inter-company debt owned to
mother companies.
External Sector
Rapid catch-up economic growth is often, if not always, associated with strong
private investment, exceeding – sometimes by far – private savings. Despite continued
increase in public savings, the private sector’s saving-investment imbalance has translated
into a sizable current account deficit. Exacerbated by high oil and other key commodity
prices, in 2007 the external current account deficit may well reach 20 percent of GDP.
The size of the deficit itself is high enough to raise concerns about external stability.
While the authorities share the legitimacy of these concerns, there are a lot of uncertainties
regarding the nature, the cause, and the implications of the external imbalance. Similar
processes can be observed in other countries that recently joined the EU which are equally
characterized by real income convergence, substantial amounts of EU grants, financial
system deepening, high future income expectations, a declining risk premium, and the overall
effects of globalization. The phenomenon of high and persistent current account deficits
under such circumstances is a rather unique one, presenting the authorities (and the Fund)
with the big challenge of how to react in such cases. The challenge becomes even larger
when the authorities, given their monetary framework, have only limited tools to tackle the
problem. In particular, this applies to the degree to which external imbalances, emanating
from a private saving-investment imbalance, can be counterbalanced by moving and keeping
the public finances in large imbalance as well.
Notwithstanding all the difficulties and surrounding uncertainty, Bulgaria has taken
up this challenge. The authorities are thankful to staff for the candid and constructive

3
dialogue on the matter during the Article IV mission. They especially appreciate the selected
issues paper that provides good quality analyses and recommendations.
Despite high current account deficits, competitiveness does not appear to have been
hurt, as evidenced by the continued solid export growth and rising market shares. REER
appreciation over the last years has been moderate when benchmarked against conventional
relationships between the exchange rate and the current account deficit. As underscored by
staff, purchasing power parity and dollar-wage comparisons across countries suggest that
Bulgaria’s prices and production costs remain competitive – a suggestion also supported by
regression-based estimates of the real equilibrium exchange rate. Moreover, official foreign
reserves have been growing in line with the higher imports and the reserve coverage has
remained broadly stable over the last couple of years. In general, the authorities and staff
share the view that a one-off private investment boom is the main driver of the large current
account deficit. Once this boom dissipates, the current account deficit is expected to start
approaching its equilibrium levels under present policy settings.
Although the soft-landing scenario is the likely one, the authorities have proved
sensitive to external vulnerabilities. They have applied extremely prudent fiscal policies, and
taken measures intended to restrain credit growth. When assessing the external imbalance
though, full account must be taken of its context. Bulgaria’s catching-up shows the usual
combination of a current account deficit financed by massive capital inflows. In itself this is
precisely desirable, and policy is carefully attuned to keeping the catching-up process stable,
while identifying and controlling its potential vulnerabilities.
Fiscal policy
Under a currency board arrangement, fiscal policy remains key to maintaining
macroeconomic stability and reducing vulnerabilities. This said, the main challenge for the
authorities is to strike the right balance between two competing objectives. On the one hand,
maximization of EU funds’ utilization must be given priority, as it provides the country with
the unique opportunity to speed-up real convergence, deepen EU integration, and
substantially increase living standards in a relatively short period of time. On the other hand,
the authorities do acknowledge the need to offset sustained private sector saving-investment
imbalances. As the latter objective has become more important over the last years, the fiscal
stance has strengthened remarkably and every year marks another record-high surplus. 2007
will be no exception from this trend. By applying this policy, the authorities reaffirm their
strong commitment to sound macroeconomic policies, acknowledging the paramount
importance of a prudent fiscal stance in the context of the currency board arrangement.
On the back of growing economic activity, increased employment, higher imports,
and higher inflation, as well as due to improved tax collection, revenue in 2007 soared
significantly above what was budgeted. The revenue windfall from the absorption boom,
along with just a modest increase in expenditures, resulted in an unprecedented surplus that,
according to the end-November data, was approaching 7 percent of GDP. Given the already
strong fiscal position, both social partners and the private sector have expressed objections to
such restrictive fiscal policy. There is marked pressure from academic circles, NGOs, and

4
various industry associations for lower tax rates while (on top of that) trade unions are
strongly backing rising demands for wage increases.
Against this background, the authorities have decided to use part of the revenue
windfall and to step up the investment program in the most needed sectors. The bulk of the
supplementary fiscal expenditures is mainly allocated for infrastructural projects like road
construction and rehabilitation, and construction of water purification stations and sewerage
systems. A big part relates to co-financing of EU-financed projects, and constitutes mostly
advance payments for projects under the operational programs in the area of regional
development, environment, rural development, and transport. Another significant part is
allocated for building-up strategic oil-reserves and oil-storage facilities. Given the recent
incidents of massive floods, funds were earmarked for river-bed corrections and preventing
landslides. The authorities have taken the necessary steps to ensure the transparency of the
extraordinary spending which was given high publicity within the country and was approved
by parliament. The most important, however, is the fact that even after this extra spending,
the overall budget surplus will again be higher than the 3.5 percent recorded in the previous
year, and far beyond the 2 percent of GDP that was initially budgeted.
With regard to the 2008 budget, the authorities are firmly committed to continuing
with their prudent fiscal stance. The budget, which is still under consideration in parliament,
envisages a surplus of at least 3 percent of GDP which is basically in line with an unchanged
fiscal stance. With the new budget the authorities are introducing a flat 10 percent personal
income tax along with a 10 percent corporate tax rate that is already in place since the
beginning of 2007. In order to minimize the revenue loss, the authorities plan to eliminate
most of the existing exemptions, thus broadening the tax base. It is the authorities’ belief that
such a step will help shrink the grey economy, while higher excises on tobacco and fuel will
compensate to a great extent for the revenue loss.
The 2008 budget has already passed the first reading and is expected to be approved
pretty soon. The authorities have undertaken another step in improving fiscal transparency by
eliminating the previous practice of across-the-board spending sequestration and introducing
a contingency reserve instead. As usual, the authorities are prepared to allow automatic fiscal
stabilizers to operate by saving most of a possible revenue overperformance.
Financial Sector
Like in many other countries in the region, a rapid bank credit expansion has been
observed over the last years. In many respects this was, and still is, a welcome development
as it symbolizes growing financial intermediation. The pace of the bank credit growth,
however, remained too high for too long which could be associated with an increase in
macroeconomic vulnerabilities. It should be stressed, however, that the rapid bank credit
growth is hardly surprising given the extremely low initial base, declining nominal interest
rates, rising income expectations, and a stable, well capitalized, and highly profitable banking
system. Moreover, in contrast to other countries with a similar pace of growth, the credit
expansion in Bulgaria has been financed mostly by a strong increase in deposits instead of
relying on foreign borrowing. All this suggests that the currently experienced rapid credit

5
growth is a healthy one, reflecting the overall strong economic performance – a suggestion
also supported by the financial soundness indicators showing no signs of deterioration.
No matter the mitigating factors, the authorities are fully cognizant of the
macroeconomic and financial stability risks associated with rapid credit growth and are
strongly committed to dealing with the situation. They have undertaken various measures in
trying to moderate the pace of growth, including by enhancing information; strengthening the
prudential and regulatory framework; and lowering liquidity by introducing administrative
limits to bank credit growth. Unfortunately, all these measures proved insufficient and credit
growth still remains high. In a repeated attempt to moderate the pace, the central bank raised
the minimum reserve requirements from 8 to 12 percent in September, and signaled that it
would be ready to adopt additional measures, including by further raising the reserve
requirements, if needed.
Finally, with regard to the ERM II, the authorities maintain their long stated position
that they will seek to joining at the earliest possible date. They have started talks with their
European partners and are ready to provide them with firm and detailed policy commitments.
The authorities’ plan is to uphold the currency board arrangement at the existing exchange
rate until Bulgaria joins the EMU. The Bulgarian government and the central bank have
committed to unilaterally maintain a zero deviation of the exchange rate after Bulgaria joins
the ERM II.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2007 Article IV Consultation with
Bulgaria
On December 14, 2007, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Bulgaria.1
Background
Bulgaria’s large external imbalance has continued to widen. Driven by massive capital inflows,
particularly foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows, the current account deficit could reach a
record level of 20 percent of GDP in 2007. While the present level of the current account deficit
is clearly above sustainable levels, external competitiveness has remained adequate. But,
underscoring growing external vulnerabilities, the net international investment position is
projected to deteriorate to about 65 percent of GDP, while gross external debt could soar to
about 88 percent of GDP. At the same time, accumulation of international reserves has
continued at a rapid clip, with reserves likely to top 40 percent of GDP by end-2007.
Real GDP growth in 2007 is likely to remain relatively steady at just over 6 percent, but
underlying inflation pressures are building up. Investment spending has continued to boom,
likely reflecting a one-off re-assessment of Bulgaria as an investment location. While FDI
inflows have been mainly absorbed by nontradables sectors, the tradeables sectors share in
real investment has held up well during the investment boom. Private consumption growth has
remained relatively subdued over recent years, in part reflecting restrained fiscal and income

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

policies. Labor market conditions have tightened: unemployment declined sharply and wage
pressures have picked up. In this setting, headline HICP inflation has increased sharply to over
10 percent, mainly owing to food and energy price shocks. While underlying core inflation has
also risen in response to higher labor cost, it has done so at a much slower pace than headline
inflation.
Since 2004, fiscal policy has achieved progressively larger fiscal surpluses, mainly as the
result of unspent revenue windfalls associated with the domestic demand boom. The 2007
fiscal surplus is projected to reach at least 3½ percent of GDP, while the underlying fiscal
surplus position is significantly more moderate. Reflecting the prudent fiscal policy stance, the
government’s balance sheet is strong, with gross public debt (about 20 percent of GDP) and
other liabilities more than offset by a growing fiscal reserve and other assets.
Bank credit has again started to expand rapidly after the administrative credit limits imposed
during 2005-06 lapsed. With hindsight, the limits helped stimulate nonbank financial flows and
did not much constrain overall private-sector credit. Banks remain well capitalized, partly
reflecting the highest minimum capital adequacy ratio among the EU New Member States.
Credit quality has been stable, as indicated by low nonperforming loan ratios, but this may
partly reflect rapid loan portfolio growth.
Bulgaria’s progress on structural reforms is at par in areas where EU legislation tends to
enforce regulatory homogeneity. However, where EU accession has provided only a weak
reform anchor, progress has been slow, including on raising the public sector’s low efficiency,
reducing costly administrative burdens on businesses, and increasing labor market flexibility.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for their strong record of stability-oriented
macroeconomic policies, which have contributed to steady GDP growth, progress in income
convergence with other EU countries, and falling unemployment. In particular, Directors
considered that fiscal and incomes policies have responded prudently so far to the widening
current account deficit and the investment boom, which is being driven by large foreign direct
investment inflows related to Bulgaria’s EU accession. Directors emphasized nevertheless
that the current account deficit is unsustainable and will need to be reduced significantly over
the medium term in order to contain external vulnerabilities. They also noted that, although
competitiveness appears not to have been affected, domestic price pressures are rising, in
large part because of region-wide increases in food and energy prices, but also because of
accelerating wage increases as the labor market tightens.
Directors considered that, assuming that a strong policy framework is sustained and the
requirements of the currency board arrangement continue to be met, the current account
deficit will gradually normalize to a more sustainable level over the medium term. In that

3
connection, there was strong support for the authorities’ strategy of maintaining the exchange
rate peg until euro adoption. Directors advised the authorities to guard against a loss of
external competitiveness, which could likely entail a severe external adjustment or a prolonged
period of slow growth.
Against this background, Directors commended the authorities for their commitment to
maintain a fiscal framework that avoids procyclical fiscal impulses and supports sustainable
convergence to EU income levels. They welcomed in particular the authorities’ intention to
target a large budget surplus in 2008 consistent with avoiding a loosening of the fiscal stance.
Several Directors observed that an even more restrictive fiscal policy may be needed to
contain demand pressures effectively and limit downside risks. It will also be important to
maintain wage discipline in the public sector by keeping wage increases in line with
productivity growth. Directors welcomed the planned further reductions in public sector
employment, which will also help mitigate labor market overheating. They called on the
authorities to review carefully spending priorities in key budget sectors, notably education and
health care, with external technical assistance, if needed. They concurred with the authorities’
plans to increase fiscal transparency, including by discontinuing across-the-board spending
sequestration.
Directors agreed that Bulgaria’s banking sector remains well supervised and regulated and
that, with buffers against a possible credit cycle downturn being well maintained, the adverse
spillovers from the recent tremors in global credit markets have been moderate. They
nevertheless encouraged the authorities to monitor banks’ risk management mechanisms
closely, as bank credit growth has surged following the lapsing of administrative credit limits at
the beginning of 2007. Directors considered that the predominance of subsidiaries of foreign
banks in Bulgaria’s financial system calls for a further strengthening of cooperation with the
supervisory authorities of the parent banks. They therefore welcomed the authorities’
participation in efforts to improve the EU’s cross-border crisis management arrangement.
Directors looked forward to the update in 2008 of Bulgaria’s FSAP.
Directors encouraged the authorities to move forward decisively with much-needed structural
reforms, in particular to raise public sector efficiency. They supported measures to promote
labor market participation and adaptability, including by giving the social partners additional
legal leeway to negotiate flexible work contracts. They welcomed the plans to activate the
electronic commercial register on January 1, 2008 and to further simplify the licensing and
permit systems, which would help lower the cost of doing business.
Directors concluded that Bulgaria’s statistical data are broadly adequate for surveillance.
Nevertheless, they encouraged further enhancements in employment, wage, and trade data.
Moreover, compiling flow of funds for households and nonfinancial corporations would help
deepen the understanding of sectoral vulnerabilities.
