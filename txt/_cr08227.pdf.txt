Staff Report for the 2008 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the European Department
(In consultation with other departments)
Approved by Juha Kähkönen and Michael T. Hadjimichael

Executive Summary
Growth has been very strong and medium-term prospects are good. However, inflation has
risen, the current account deficit has deteriorated sharply, and financial sector risks have
increased. Sharp rises in public spending have fed domestic demand, although fiscal deficits
have been contained and public debt is low. Monetary conditions have tightened somewhat,
but the de facto peg to the dollar has limited the ability of monetary policy to combat
inflation. Staff projects growth to slow from 7½ percent last year to a more sustainable
5½ percent this year; the authorities project somewhat stronger growth.
It was agreed that fiscal restraint is key to slowing demand growth and easing inflationary
pressures. Staff recommends cutting the budget deficit by 1½ percent of GDP in 2008, to
0.5 percent of GDP, by restraining spending. The authorities see less scope for spending
restraint, but envisage a deficit below 1 percent of GDP via buoyant revenues.
The authorities have tightened monetary conditions, but monetary policy alone will be
insufficient to reduce inflation to acceptable rates. To give monetary policy more scope for
action, the authorities should increase exchange rate flexibility, consistent with last year’s
NBU policy guideline. Recently, the exchange rate has fluctuated more widely. Ultimately,
inflation targeting should replace the exchange rate as the nominal anchor, which will require
coordinated effort by the government and the central bank.
While the authorities and staff agree that the banking sector as a whole is profitable and well
capitalized, the supervisor should continue to strengthen risk management and oversight. Key
measures include consolidated supervision, increased transparency, enhanced risk
management, relaxed bank secrecy provisions, strengthened prudential requirements, and
better mechanisms for bank exit.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Growth has been strong and Ukraine’s medium-term potential is enormous. Real
GDP has grown by 7½ percent a year on average since 2000, in line with other CIS countries
and higher than in most other transition economies. The economy has been surprisingly
resilient in the face of a doubling of imported natural gas prices and an uncertain political
climate. The implementation of structural reforms would boost growth potential, allowing
Ukraine to close the income gap with neighboring countries (Figure 1).
2.
Since the last Article IV consultation, developments in Ukraine and globally
have raised macroeconomic issues to the top of the policy agenda. High inflation and a
widening current account deficit in Ukraine, together with global financial turbulence and
slowing world growth, have increased short-term vulnerabilities. Recent progress on
macroeconomic and structural reform has been uneven (Table 1), in large part reflecting
protracted political uncertainties leading up to parliamentary elections last September. A new
Orange coalition government came to power in December 2007, with a paper thin majority,
and presidential elections are scheduled for the fall of 2009. The Article IV discussions were
held during March 20-April 2, 2008 (Appendix I).
II. BACKGROUND
3.
The economy overheated in 2007. The economy was pushed beyond its capacity by
expansionary fiscal and incomes policies and high steel prices (which fuelled very strong
domestic demand growth), and by very rapid money and credit growth (Table 2, Figure 2).
These factors, together with rising food and energy prices, lifted CPI inflation to over
25 percent at end-March 2008 (Figure 3). Core inflation has also risen, nominal wage growth
is very high, and inflation expectations have drifted up.
4.

Substantial vulnerabilities have built up:

•

Banks’ direct and indirect credit risks have increased, reflecting very high lending
growth, including in foreign exchange to unhedged borrowers (Figure 4). Greater
intermediation is a natural consequence of financial development, but the rapid credit
growth may be undermining credit quality. Moreover, house prices are high relative
to incomes, raising credit risks on mortgages (Figure 5). The banking system may
have to undergo some consolidation, since a number of smaller institutions are
unlikely to remain competitive.

•

The current account deficit has deteriorated sharply because of very strong domestic
demand growth and, more recently, eroding competitiveness (Table 3, Figure 6). This
has occurred despite large terms of trade gains, which may be coming to an end and

5
may even reverse as gas prices rise further and if steel prices revert toward historical
trends (Table 4, Figure 7). 1 Capital inflows, including FDI, remain strong, however.
•

Private external debt and debt rollover have risen sharply, leaving the economy more
sensitive to balance-sheet risks and deteriorating global liquidity conditions. Some
debt may be held by Ukrainians (i.e. misrecorded) and some offset by unrecorded
foreign exchange assets in Ukraine.

5.
The turbulence on international financial markets has affected Ukraine, but
significant financial or corporate sector strains are not yet evident. Reflecting Ukraine’s
vulnerabilities, since mid-2007 external spreads have risen by more than in other similar
countries and bank and corporate euro-bond issuance has dried up. Banks’ funding for their
foreign exchange lending has shifted to shorter-term foreign loans, mostly from parent banks,
and bank lending to corporates has picked up, keeping problems at bay. 2

itself has helped bring about. Nevertheless, the
fiscal stance has been procyclical and Ukraine is one of the few countries in Eastern Europe
to have increased its fiscal deficit as capital inflows have surged.
7.
Monetary conditions have tightened somewhat, but the close control of the
exchange rate that characterizes the monetary regime limits what can be done on this
front. As the NBU stepped up sterilization and imposed new reserve requirements on banks’
foreign borrowing beginning in late 2007, excess banking system liquidity fell considerably
and interest rates rose sharply, notably on the interbank market (Table 6, Figure 9).

See Box 2 in IMF country document 07/05 for background on lost savings. Total remaining claims are
estimated at 18 percent of GDP at end-2007.

6
Nevertheless, real interest rates generally remain negative and credit growth is still very
high—76 percent year-on-year in March. Since mid-March, the exchange rate has been
allowed to appreciate outside the narrow Hrv/$ 5.00-5.06 band. If this greater fluctuation
were to persist, the Fund classification could change, depending on the regime put in place.
8.
Progress has been made on a long structural reform agenda, but much remains
undone (Table 7). Key areas requiring attention are: improving the business climate by
updating and strengthening the legal framework, improving accounting standards, and
establishing a market for agricultural land; continuing to liberalize trade policy (WTO
accession was a significant achievement in this regard), including by abandoning agricultural
export restrictions (the recent easing of wheat restrictions was a step forward); improving
energy efficiency, including by allowing all domestic prices to reflect full costs; and
strengthening tax administration.
III. DISCUSSIONS WITH THE AUTHORITIES
9.
In light of Ukraine’s high inflation rate and vulnerabilities, discussions focused
on near-term (2008-09) macroeconomic stability-related issues: policies to reduce
inflation, including key steps toward robust fiscal and monetary regimes, and to contain
financial sector vulnerabilities (an FSAP update was concluded). Selected structural issues
important to short-term macro performance (including gas pricing and tax reform), as well as
the consequences of WTO accession, were also covered. The broader structural agenda,
which the authorities and staff broadly support and which has been discussed extensively in
previous Article IV consultations and by other international agencies, was not taken up in
detail.
A. OUTLOOK
10.
Real GDP growth is set to slow in 2008-09, from 7½ percent last year, although
the authorities projected higher growth than staff. Weaker export-market growth, slowing
real wage increases, moderating terms of trade gains (due to steep rises in gas import prices),
and higher financing costs are expected to reduce demand. Staff projects growth at
5½ percent in 2008, notwithstanding an anticipated rebound in agricultural production after
last year’s disappointing harvest. The current account deficit is projected to widen to
7.1 percent of GDP, reflecting terms of trade developments, weaker competitiveness, and
domestic demand growth that still exceeds output growth. The authorities argued growth
would slow less and the current account would widen less than projected by staff, pointing to
the harvest and more optimistic projections of steel prices. Slower growth and the improved

7
harvest should gradually ease inflationary pressures, 4 although in light of the very high CPI
increases so far in 2008 the authorities were revising up their official (budget) projection.

11.
Staff saw risks to its projection as largely balanced, but conceded that
uncertainty is high. A key issue is the development of world steel prices, which have been
very closely linked to growth. World growth and the impact of global financial turbulence
may also have important ramifications for Ukraine in the coming several quarters. Given the
large risks on both sides, the mission discussed two alternative short-term scenarios,
emphasizing the macroeconomic tensions: continued high inflation in an upside scenario, and
significant reserve losses, contracting credit, and sharply declining real GDP growth in a
downside scenario (Table 8, Figure 10).

In the medium term, staff projects growth to fall temporarily below potential,
which would eliminate inflationary pressures. (Table 9). Gas import prices are assumed to
rise to transit-adjusted international levels in 2009, and steel export prices to fall gradually

8
toward their long-term trend. The baseline assumes some easing of growth in fiscal transfers
and, consistent with the authorities’ stated policy, greater exchange rate flexibility; these
policy adjustments are critical to ensure a soft landing. The less favorable terms of trade and
cumulative loss in competitiveness lead to a depreciation, which weakens domestic demand
via balance-sheet effects on households holding dollar liabilities. Under this scenario,
external debt stabilizes, though at a higher level; however, adverse shocks could increase it to
uncomfortably high levels (Table 10, Figure 11). Public debt is sustainable under a wide
range of scenarios (Table 11, Figure 12).
13.
Structural reforms were seen as crucial to medium-term growth prospects. The
authorities noted that WTO accession and the Euro 2012 Cup would spur considerable
investment, and viewed trade negotiations with the EU (formal negotiations have recently
begun) as another important step forward. Apart from tariffs and agricultural subsidies,
Ukraine committed under the WTO to: allow capital flows associated with provision of
lending and deposit-taking services; a schedule of export tax reductions, eliminating trade
taxes (other than customs tariffs), among others. The authorities characterized WTO
commitments as completing a series of gradual legislative changes, and therefore did not
anticipate an economic shock upon accession.
B. FISCAL POLICY
14.
It was agreed that fiscal restraint was key to reducing inflationary pressures.
The authorities felt that the 2008 deficit could be held below 1 percent of GDP, compared to
2 percent of GDP in 2007. Although spending pressures, including to raise minimum wages
and restore the lost savings, remained very strong, they also expected revenues to be quite
strong, noting that customs receipts in particular had jumped sharply this year owing to better
administration. They judged that privatization receipts in excess of those already in the 2008
budget could be saved. The mission suggested a slightly larger deficit cut of 1½ percent of
GDP to restrain domestic demand growth and insure against inflation risks.
15.
The mission argued that spending should be contained, to reduce fiscal pressure
and prevent a further increase in government spending in relation to GDP. This could
be implemented by reining in growth in transfers and delaying further restitution of lost
savings until demand pressures eased. 5 Also, restraining increases in minimum wages and
public sector wages would be vital to break the wage-price spiral that seemed to be
developing. The mission stressed the need to strengthen tax administration and broaden the
tax base to shore up revenues (Table 12). In particular, staff opposed replacing the VAT with
a sales tax, which would only aggravate collection problems, and the authorities indicated
that this was fading as a policy issue. The authorities, in a recently formulated inflation plan,
5

08/xx.

9
while containing many good initiatives, also suggested administrative price control measures,
which the mission argued would not reduce inflation and would distort incentives.
16.
The mission argued that fiscal policy should adjust to economic developments,
given the uncertainties in the projection. Ukraine’s low fiscal deficit and public debt allow
scope for flexibility on both sides. Relative to staff advice to hold the 2008 deficit to
½ percent of GDP, if upside risks materialize the deficit should be allowed to shrink further;
but if growth slows significantly a larger deficit, via the automatic stabilizers, may be
appropriate, although only if inflation is clearly abating and financing remains ample.
17.
The authorities saw merit in the mission’s suggested changes to the fiscal
framework. 6 Staff argued that better integrating macro-fiscal analysis into budget
preparation and presentation, in particular cyclically adjusted balances, would convey a
clearer picture of the fiscal policy stance; a medium-term expenditure framework would
enhance fiscal-monetary coordination and help to guide the annual budget process toward
medium-term policy goals; full integration into the budget of quasi-fiscal subsidies would
improve transparency and reduce fiscal risks; and liberalizing prices would reduce fiscal risks
and improve economic efficiency. The authorities agreed that the fiscal framework could
usefully be strengthened, and recently announced a gradual increase in gas prices to
households and energy producers (public and private enterprises already pay full cost).
However, they judged that in recent years governments had been too short lived and
economic developments too variable for medium-term budgeting to be effective.
C. MONETARY AND EXCHANGE RATE POLICY
18.
The NBU emphasized the measures already taken to tighten monetary
conditions, and indicated more would be done as needed. The NBU judged that excess
banking system liquidity had been eliminated, but also that monetary policy alone could not
contain inflation. They also argued that the effective nominal depreciation of the hryvnia,
which had fallen with the dollar, had contributed to inflationary pressures. The mission
agreed, noting that the tight management of the exchange rate had made it difficult for the
NBU to control inflows and the money supply during 2007 and obscured the risks undertaken
by unhedged dollar borrowers. The mission also noted that, under the de facto exchange rate
peg, still-tighter conditions might only attract speculative capital inflows, notwithstanding
capital controls on non-resident holdings of hryvnia. The authorities shared this concern and
were considering additional reserve requirements on short-term capital.
19.
Staff repeated its call for a gradual transition to a more flexible exchange rate
and, eventually, inflation targeting. Such a shift would provide more scope for monetary
policy to use control of money and credit growth as a nominal anchor, thereby easing
6

Selected Issues Paper, “Strengthening Ukraine’s Fiscal Framework.”

10
inflation pressures. Moreover, it would allow the nominal exchange rate to bear some of the
burden of needed real exchange rate adjustment to shocks, especially terms of trade shocks to
which Ukraine is highly exposed. To implement this policy change, the exchange rate band
should progressively widen. Eventually, the exchange rate should be freely floated, with
inflation targeting (IT) providing the nominal anchor.
20.
The authorities concurred with staff analysis implying that the value of the
hryvnia is broadly consistent with fundamentals, although staff emphasized that the
situation could deteriorate (Box 1). In particular, if domestic demand and inflation were not
contained further erosion of cost competitiveness would, at an unchanged dollar exchange
rate, move the hryvnia toward overvaluation. In light of this possibility, staff argued that the
time was now propitious to increase exchange rate flexibility. Slightly further out, the 2009
monetary policy guidelines should indicate that the band will be progressively widened as
circumstances permit and policy needs require, without specifying bands or timing in
advance.
21.
The NBU had taken steps to prepare for more flexibility and was considering
further moves (Table 13). Although no announcement has been made of a change in policy,
notwithstanding the recent larger fluctuations in the exchange rate, the NBU indicated that
the band might be widened and a new mechanism for setting the official rate (now
Hrv/$5.05) introduced to bring it closer to interbank rates. Overall, the NBU reported that it
could soon be fully capable of executing an IT policy if the decision were made to go this
route, but worried that the very open structure of the Ukraine economy, the lack of developed
domestic debt and capital markets, and extensive use of administered prices could limit the
effectiveness monetary policy.
22.
The mission stressed the need for strong political backing for the change in the
monetary policy framework, and the government indicated that it supported the NBU’s
exchange rate strategy. The NBU recently issued the Green Paper, a public document for
discussion laying out options for strengthening monetary policy and NBU independence, and
has argued for securitization of outstanding government debt to the NBU and more flexibility
in the transfer of NBU profits to the government. Staff argued that a clear government
mandate to the NBU would bolster credibility and that, as the IT framework was being put in
place, NBU independence would need to be ensured.

Box 1: Exchange Rate Evaluation
The weight of evidence suggests that the exchange rate in 2007 was broadly consistent with
fundamentals (Figure 4). On the CGER macroeconomic balance approach, adjusting for

indicates that the underlying current account deficit would stabilize net foreign liabilities at their

23.
The authorities and the mission also discussed a number of more technical
reforms to ensure the success of the transition to IT. It was agreed that needed financial
market development would be fostered by greater reliance on domestic-currency government
debt issuance, a measure already announced by the government, and early elimination of the
foreign exchange transactions tax, rather than in 2010 as scheduled. The NBU noted that it
had strengthened analytical capacity and communications strategy, although the mission
argued for still better integration of analytics into decision making and for publication of
inflation-report-type documents
D. FINANCIAL SECTOR POLICY
24.
While the banking sector as a whole seemed profitable and well capitalized, the
FSAP update identified a number of vulnerabilities (Table 14). These include rising credit
risks stemming from very high credit growth, balance sheet mismatches as unhedged
households have borrowed heavily in dollars, liquidity risk as banks have become
increasingly dependent on foreign funding, and banking supervision weaknesses aggravated
by increasing complexity of the financial sector, and the existence of a number of small,
apparently uncompetitive banks. To strengthen the system, based on the FSAP update the
mission called for a number of measures to address credit risks, enhance supervision, and
improve the bank resolution framework to facilitate bank mergers (notably by increasing
incentives of owners of weak banks to agree to mergers) if, as seems likely, the sector
undergoes consolidation (Table 15).
25.
The authorities judged the banking sector to be sound overall, but acknowledged
risks. They noted that the growing presence of foreign-owned banks, which account for
some 37 percent of banking system capital, had strengthened the sector, even though these
banks also accounted for a great deal of the increase in credit (including in dollar loans).
They also emphasized that transparency had improved; the NBU had recently published a list
of ownership of most banks and required that banks publish information quarterly on their
finances. They felt that conversion of banks to open-joint-stock companies, now underway,
held the promise of further transparency. And they pointed to the increase in minimum bank
capital requirements, to a level twice that in Europe, as encouraging bank consolidation. The
supervisor agreed that, nonetheless, the scale of dollar lending and potential problems with
the quality of household loans were matters of concern.
26.
The supervisor had taken measures to address credit risks, and was considering
others. On-site inspection had been stepped up. In 2008, as maturities on foreign borrowing
shortened and with no sign of slowing credit growth, new capital requirements were imposed
on banks’ maturity gap and higher risk weights were attached to riskier asset classes. More
measures, for instance new limits on banks’ net external borrowing to capital and tighter
definitions of non-performing loans, could be taken as necessary, but also with due

13
consideration to the stress that monetary tightening was already placing on the financial
system.
27.
The authorities and the mission discussed contingency planning in light of the
evolving challenges facing the Ukrainian economy. The authorities noted that they had
successfully dealt with a crisis in 2004, including by tightening capital controls and that their
reserve position is much stronger now than it had been then (Figure 14). The mission agreed
that in many respects Ukraine was in a stronger position now, and also that the strategy
adopted in 2004 would still be appropriate and could still be effective. But it also noted that
the world and, especially, the Ukrainian financial sector had changed remarkably since then,
posing new risks. Ukraine has become more dependent on external financing and the banking
sector has become much larger and significantly more sophisticated. Moreover, the planned
gradual relaxation of capital controls—an initiative supported by staff (subject to the
continuation of narrowly defined safeguards) as a way to improve the business
environment—would remove one tool that had been used in the past. The authorities
expressed considerable interest in pursuing contingency planning, including via simulations
of responses by the relevant government bodies to unexpected adverse events.

IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
28.
The Ukrainian economy has grown strongly since 2000, and medium-term
potential is enormous. A robust international environment, stabilizing macroeconomic
policies, including the de facto currency peg to the dollar and low fiscal deficits, and
significant structural reforms all sustained growth since 2000. By many measures, Ukraine
has also become better insulated against shocks: reserves have increased substantially; the
underlying fiscal position is strong and sustainable under a wide range of economic
scenarios; the financial sector as a whole appears to be well capitalized and profitable; and
WTO accession, the negotiations on an EU trade agreement, and Euro 2012 should spur
structural reform efforts. A comprehensive structural reform program would increase
economic capacity in the medium term, helping to ensure rapidly rising living standards.

14
29.
Amidst turmoil in global financial markets and volatility in world commodity
prices, however, measures will be needed to deal with heightened vulnerabilities. Very
strong domestic demand growth has resulted in a deteriorating current account and, along
with rising food and energy prices, unacceptably high inflation. The real exchange rate is
broadly consistent with fundamentals, but it could become overvalued if strong domestic
demand growth and inflation persist. Global turbulence has heightened external financing
risks. Very high domestic lending growth, including in foreign exchange to unhedged
borrowers, and high house prices point to increased credit risks. In view of the near-term
challenges, measures will be needed to strengthen fiscal, monetary, and financial policies. In
this connection, calls in the authorities’ recent anti-inflation program for greater fiscal
prudence and better use of the exchange rate band are welcome; administrative measures, by
contrast, will be ineffective and distorting.
30.
The fiscal stance should be tightened to contain domestic demand. A general
government deficit reduction of 1½ percent of GDP in 2008, bringing it to near balance,
would ease pressures significantly. Given the substantial uncertainties regarding economic
prospects, the authorities should stand ready to adjust the fiscal deficit, via automatic
stabilizers, as needed: higher growth than expected would increase inflationary risks and call
for a smaller deficit, while if growth fell significantly more than projected and inflation
abated there would be scope for a larger deficit. Excess privatization receipts should be saved
and further restitution of lost savings should be spread over a number of years or offset by
spending cuts elsewhere. Incomes policies and increases in minimum wages and public
sector wages should be scaled back, to be consistent with single-digit inflation. Tax cuts,
which are desirable as part of an overall reduction in the size of government, should be fully
offset with spending cuts or base broadening. Strengthening tax administration is a priority,
and in this context the VAT should be retained because the alternative of a sales tax would be
harder to enforce.
31.
The fiscal framework should be strengthened. Fiscal policy formulation and
assessment would be significantly improved by using structural fiscal balances, broadening
fiscal coverage, and adopting a medium-term fiscal framework. Gas prices should be fully
passed through to final consumers, with vulnerable groups protected by better targeted social
programs.
32.
Recent and welcome NBU policies to tighten monetary conditions should be
continued, but the exchange rate should be made more flexible and, in the medium
term, inflation targeting introduced. Sterilization and reduction of excess banking-system
liquidity have been helpful, but the de facto exchange rate peg is no longer adequate, as the
rise in inflation illustrates. Therefore, as anticipated in the 2008 monetary guidelines, the
current monetary framework should be replaced as soon as possible by, first, a more flexible
exchange rate to allow more scope for active monetary policy, and ultimately by inflation
targeting as a nominal anchor. Since the exchange rate is now broadly consistent with

15
fundamentals, this is an opportune time to introduce this policy change. To retain flexibility,
the bands and the dates at which they change should not be specified in advance, but care
should be taken to use control of money and credit growth, via monetary instruments, as the
interim nominal anchor during the transition to inflation targeting. The NBU should continue
its welcome efforts to strengthen its analytical capacity and integrate macroeconomic
analysis into its policy decisions. Communication with the public and the markets can be
improved through publication of inflation reports and regular, transparent announcements of
policy intentions and actions.
33.
Public and decisive government support for inflation targeting is fundamental.
The government should provide the monetary authorities with a clear inflation-targeting
mandate. As the new regime is put in place, the NBU’s operational independence needs to be
ensured, including by being more flexible on profit transfers to the government and by
securitizing outstanding NBU debt. To prepare for inflation targeting, the government should
abolish the tax on foreign exchange transactions, securitize its liabilities to the NBU by midyear, issue more public debt in hryvnia, and liberalize domestic prices to provide monetary
policy maximum leverage over inflation.
34.
Although the banking sector as a whole seems profitable and well capitalized, it
will be crucial to address the growing vulnerabilities identified in the FSAP update. Key
measures to strengthen supervision are consolidated supervision, increased transparency of
bank ownership (the recent publication by the NBU of bank ownership is welcome in this
regard), encouragement to banks to enhance their risk management capabilities, strong
guidance to banks regarding stress testing, and intensified on-site examinations. Prudential
measures might include, in addition to the recent welcome increase in minimum statutory
capital, greater risk weights for assets that pose higher credit risk (notably unhedged foreign
currency denominated lending) and stronger prudential requirements for banks with
deteriorating liquidity positions. Problem banks need to be identified earlier and bank exit
options expanded to encourage mergers. Finally, to foster the development of capital
markets, non-bank supervision should be strengthened.
35.
Contingency planning should be further developed and refined, to ensure an
effective response in the event of unforeseen turbulence. Close cooperation across
relevant governmental agencies will be critical in such circumstances, and simulations would
help foster this. The authorities’ intention to implement a sequenced liberalization of capital
controls, including through a new foreign exchange law, is welcome, although safeguards
should be retained to be used only in clearly specified and exceptional circumstances
36.
Ukrainian statistics have improved significantly and are adequate for
surveillance. However, heightened risks underscore the need to improve data on foreign
trade, notably trade prices, and on external assets, liabilities, and investment flows.
37.

It is recommended that the next consultation occur on the standard 12-month cycle.

1/ Each scenario assumes: (i) a de facto exchange rate peg through 2009; (ii) full pass-through of rising energy import prices;
(iii) the free-play of automatic stabilizers in 2008 and a general government fiscal deficit of 1.5 percent of GDP in 2009; (iv)
alignment of the minimum wage with the minimum subsistence level by end-2009; and (v) convergence of natural gas prices to
Western European levels (adjusted for transit) by 2009.
2/ The upside scenario assumes an increase in steel prices by 40 percent in 2008 and a stabilization in 2009, more favorable
financing conditions and significantly higher FDI relative to the baseline.
3/ The downside scenario assumes an increase in steel prices by 10 in 2008, followed by a decline by 15 percent in 2009; it
also assumes significantly lower FDI relative to the baseline, and much more difficult financing conditions.

Table 1. Reactions to IMF Advice
Policy area

IMF advice

Authorities' reaction

Fiscal policy

Maintain a general government
deficit of about 2 percent of GDP,
and save excess revenues; over
time reduce the ratio of recurrent
spending to GDP through a
restrained incomes policy.

The deficit has been kept
below 2 percent of GDP, but
excess revenues have for the
most part been spent. Wages
and social transfers have
grown at very rapid rates.

Monetary and exchange rate
policy

Shift gradually to a flexible
exchange rate regime, and
ultimately, inflation targeting.

NBU agrees in principle, but
change has been slow. TA has
helped build up capacity in the
NBU for such a move (see
Table 13).

Financial sector policy

Raise capital and provisioning
requirements for banks; amend
legislation to increase sector
transparency and to provide a
stronger legal basis for crisis
management.

Provisioning and minimum
capital requirements have been
raised, but the overall capital
adequacy ratio has remained at
10 percent. Legal amendments
have been stalled in parliament
for several years.

Structural reforms

Accelerate implementation of the
long list of measures highlighted
by various IFIs. Recent Fund
emphasis has been on trade
reform; energy sector reform
(price pass-through); tax system
reform (VAT administration, base
broadening and rate reductions);
and financial sector development.

Strong consensus on trade
reform has produced results
(WTO accession), but progress
in other areas has been limited,
with a consensus on how to
proceed yet to emerge.

Social indicators
Per capita GDP: US$ 3,056 (2007); Poverty (percent of population): 8.0 (2006; World Bank estimate);
Life expectancy at birth: 68.2 years (2006); Infant mortality (per 1,000): 14.0 (2004); Net primary enrollment (percent net): 86 (2004)
Sources: Ukrainian authorities; and staff estimates and projections.
1/ Policies assumed here include: (i) a de facto exchange rate peg through 2009 and passive monetary policy in support of this; (ii) convergence of gas
prices to European levels (adjusted for transit) by 2009; (iii) full pass-through of rising energy import prices; (iv) the free-play of automatic stabilizers in 2008
and a general government fiscal deficit of 1.5 percent of GDP in 2009; and (v) alignment of the minimum wage with the minimum subsistence level by end-2009.
2/ Inflation excluding extreme price movements in the CPI components. The concept used here is the 65th percentile of the distribution of the monthly price changes.
3/The public finance aggregates cover the whole of the general government sector, including local authorities and the social funds. Reported fiscal outturns
are also adjusted by staff to ensure consistency with international accounting rules.
4/ From 2003 onward, based on an accounting treatment that excludes offset-based amortization to Russia, which decreases revenues and increases net external
financing (and the budget deficit) by 0.1 percent of GDP relative to previous years.
5/ The cyclically-adjusted balance estimates the government fiscal balance if output were at its potential level.
6/ Government and government-guaranteed debt and arrears, plus NBU debt. Excludes debt by state-owned enterprises.
7/ Annual GDP divided by end-period broad money (M3).
8/ Period averages; (+) represents real appreciation; based on CPI inflation and IMF INS trade weights (1999-2001).

to fill financing gaps in the pension and social funds. The aggregates for the general government cover the whole of the general government sector, including
local authorities and the social funds. The differences between staff's and the authorities' public finances numbers and projections also reflect accounting
treatments to ensure consistency with international accounting rules.

3/ In 2005-06, adjusted for Hrv 2.3 billion in advanced pension payments paid in December 2005, and due in January 2006.
4/ In 2004-06, includes pensions on army, interior, emergency services, penitentiary, tax police and security paid directly by the State budget. Administration of
these payments was transferred to the Pension Fund in 2007.

Sources: Ukrainian authorities; and staff estimates and projections.
1/ Each scenario assumes: (i) a de facto exchange rate peg through 2009 and passive monetary policy in support of this; (ii) convergence of natural gas
import prices to Western European levels (adjusted for transit) by 2009; (iii) full pass-through of rising energy import prices; (iii) the free-play of automatic
stabilizers in 2008 and a general government fiscal deficit of 1.5 percent of GDP in 2009; and (iv) alignment of the minimum wage with the minimum
subsistence level by end-2009. The upside scenario assumes an increase in steel prices by 40 percent in 2008 and a stabilization in 2009, more favorable
financing conditions and significantly higher FDI relative to the baseline. The downside scenario assumes an increase in steel prices by 10 in 2008, followed by
a 10 percent decline in 2009; it also assumes significantly lower FDI relative to the baseline, and more difficult financing conditions.
2/ The public finance aggregates cover the whole of the general government sector, including local authorities and the social funds. Reported fiscal outturns
are also adjusted by staff to ensure consistency with international accounting rules.
3/ Government and government-guaranteed debt, and NBU debt. Excludes debts by state-owned enterprises.

Sources: Ukrainian authorities; and staff estimates and projections.
1/ Policies assumed here include: (i) a de facto exchange rate peg through 2009, followed by a gradually widening exchange rate corridor; (ii) passive monetary policy through
2009 as a result of foreign exchange interventions to defend the peg; (iii) convergence of natural gas import prices to Western European levels (adjusted for transit) by 2009;
(iv) full pass-through of rising energy import prices; and (v) alignment of the minimum wage with the minimum subsistence level by end-2009.
2/ Inflation excluding extreme price movements in the CPI components. The concept used here is the 65th percentile of the distribution of the monthly price changes.
3/ The public finance aggregates cover the whole of the general government sector, including local authorities and the social funds. Reported fiscal outturns are also adjusted
by staff to ensure consistency with international accounting rules.
4/ Government and government-guaranteed debt, and NBU debt. Excludes debts by state-owned enterprises.

Table 12. Ukraine: Selected Tax Policy and Administration Priorities.
Authorities proposals

7

Staff recommendation

Tax policy:

Broaden the tax base and reduce distortions:

¾

¾

¾

¾

Replace the VAT with a retail stage
sales tax (BYT election platform).
Maintain different registration
thresholds for the VAT and the
Simplified Tax System (STS).
Phase out the foreign exchange
transactions tax (FETT) over several
years.

¾

¾

¾

Retain the VAT to ensure compliance, but remove the remaining VAT
exemptions and introduce the new VAT regime on agriculture.
Keep preferential investment incentives to a minimum to reduce economic
distortions and avoid a large-scale risk of fiscal leakage. Exempting
exporters from corporate income tax is discriminatory, facilitates tax
evasion, and may be incompatible with the WTO’s code of subsidies.
Instead use accelerated depreciation and capital allowances to stimulate
investment.
Align the STS threshold with that of the VAT; reduce the threshold for
physical persons; rationalize eligibility criteria for the regime; and set up a
graduation rule from the system.
Immediately abolish the FETT to encourage the development of the
foreign exchange market.

Tax administration:

Provide revenue stability and improve compliance:

¾

¾

¾

¾

Set a 30 day limit on the conduct of
large taxpayer audits, which can only
be extended by another 30 days.
Require court approval for collecting
unpaid debts, for declining registration
to fraudulent taxpayers, and for
accessing banking information.
Institute high penalties for
underreporting of tax (at 50 percent of
underreported liability).

¾

¾

Tax administrations should not set timeframes for completing an audit.
Instead, fair treatment of taxpayers should be ensured by setting clear
audit standards, publishing taxpayer rights, and allowing for appeals and
investigation of allegations of harassment or corruption.
The filing of tax lien, authority to seize financial assets (e.g., cash on hand,
securities, bank accounts), setting conditions for registration and
deregistration, and accessing banking information for audit purposes
should be allowed without court approval to ensure effective collection
enforcement and to combat fraud.
Introduce a two-tiered penalty for simple and gross negligence and a
separate penalty for late filing, in line with international standards.

VAT administration:

Ensure timely refund provision to eligible taxpayers:

¾

¾

¾
¾

No clear deadline for payment of VAT
refunds.
Require a full audit of all VAT cash
refunds within 30 days.
Require comprehensive documentation
for the monetary reimbursement of
VAT credit.

¾

¾
¾

7

Establish a clear deadline for the refund based on the expiry of the carryforward period. Exporters should be reimbursed monthly, in line with
international standards.
Repeal the requirement for a full audit of cash refunds and reduce the need
for supporting documentation by introducing a risk-based verification
system and a dedicated VAT audit program to ensure compliance.
Ensure that interest is paid on late refunds to compensate taxpayers with
legitimate refund claims for being deprived of their working capital.
Adequately budget for projected refund claims.

Selected proposals from the “Concept for Tax Reform” paper, Draft Tax Code, and (where
noted) the BYT election platform.

Foreign exchange turnover tax reduced to 0.5 percent in
2008 budget.
Prepared a concept note, and draft legislation, on foreign
exchange market liberalization

•
•

Outreach to financial sector and academia on IT

•

1/ Steps identified in the NBU’s 2006 Action Plan and Fund recommendations.

Banking sector stability

Financial market
development

Introduced more frequent public discussion of monetary
policy.

Refined quarterly projection model and quarterly business
outlook survey.

•
•

Developed an exclusion-based core inflation indicator, and
began publishing this from January 2008

•

Communication of
monetary policies

Regular preparation of a macroeconomic survey assessing
short term outlook, including under different monetary policy
actions.

•

Capacity to model and
forecast

Gradually implement more risk-based supervision.
Further tighten banking supervision, regulation, and legislation.

•
•

Simplify procedures for working in the foreign exchange
market.

Develop benchmarks for government securities.

•
•

Abolish the foreign exchange turnover tax.

•

Conduct press conferences and issue press releases on
inflation targeting.

Further modernize the NBU website.

•
•

Issue an Inflation Report.

Develop full range of core inflation indicators.

•

•

Integrate macroeconomic survey into monetary policy decision
making.

Apply monetary instruments in a consistent, transparent, and
market-oriented manner.

Identify key policy rate; and actively steer the policy rate within
a gradually narrowing interest rate corridor.

Gradually allow greater exchange rate flexibility, within a
narrow but, over time, widening exchange rate corridor.

Finalize the Green paper, and translate this into an Action Plan
for 2008-09.
Adopt further amendments to the NBU Act that would provide
the NBU with a clear mandate to achieve price stability and
allow for greater NBU independence.

Further Steps Needed 1/

•

•

Introduced more active use of deposit facility, focused around •
two week CDs, although at a low interest rate of 1 percent.

•

Allowed the hryvnia/U.S. dollar exchange rate to fluctuate in a •
1 percent corridor, and to occasionally move up to 1 percent
outside of this corridor.

•

•

•

Published a draft Green paper, soliciting public input on
options for NBU mandate and independence.

1/ NPLs are those classified as substandard, doubtful, and loss.
2/ Increase in nonperforming loans (NPLs) in 2003 partly due to new classification rules.
3/ The NBU estimates that as of end-March 2004, 6.2 percent of loans classified as substandard were being timely serviced.
4/ About half of the drop in the provision to NPL ratio from end-2002 to end-2003 is due to new loan classification rules.

VIII. Safeguards Assessments:
The National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) was subject to a safeguards assessment with respect to
the Stand-by Arrangement, approved on March 29, 2004. The safeguards assessment was
completed on July 14, 2004. The assessment found that the NBU has made progress in recent
years to strengthen its safeguards framework, however, further improvements can be made in
some areas, notably the financial reporting and legal structure and independence areas. The
main recommendations of the assessment include (i) full adoption of International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS), (ii) a detailed review of the NBU Law, and other legislation that
impinges on the central bank, in order to strengthen the NBU's independence, and (iii) semiannual audits by the NBU's internal audit function of the monetary data reported to the Fund.
IX. Exchange Arrangements:
In September 1996, the authorities introduced the hryvnia (HRV) at a conversion rate of
karbovanets (Krb) 100,000 to HRV 1. The rate was initially informally pegged to the dollar.
In September 1997, the peg was replaced by a formal band of HRV 1.7–HRV 1.9 per
U.S. dollar. The limits of the band were moved on several occasions. Since March 19, 1999,
the exchange rate for the hryvnia has been determined by the interbank market for foreign
exchange. On February 22, 2000, the NBU officially confirmed its intention to allow the free
float of the hryvnia, but has intervened regularly to limit fluctuations. The exchange rate
arrangement has been reclassified, effective January 1, 2001, as a conventional pegged
arrangement. On March 31, 2008 the official hryvnia/U.S. dollar rate has stood at 5.05.
On September 24, 1996, Ukraine accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and
4 of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement, and two remaining restrictions were eliminated in
May 1997. A number of new restrictions on current international transactions were
introduced in September 1998, and were removed in March 1999.
9

This schedule is not the currently applicable schedule of payments to the IMF. Rather, the
schedule presents all payments to the IMF under the illustrative assumption that repayment
expectations-except for SRF repayment expectations-would be extended to their respective
obligation dates by the IMF Executive Board upon request of the debtor country. SRF
repayments are shown on their current expectation dates, unless already converted to an
obligation date by the IMF Executive Board.

49
X. Article IV Consultation:
The discussions for the 2008 Article IV Consultation took place in Kyiv between March 20
and April 1, 2008. The concluding statement of the mission was posted at www.imf.org on
April 16, 2008.
The IMF team comprised Messrs. Ford (Head), Flanagan, Moulin (all EUR), Mr. Driessen
(MCM), Ms. Zakharova (FAD), Mr. Hofman (PDR), and Mr. Horvath, Resident
Representative.
The mission met with NBU Governor Stelmakh, Finance Minister Pynzenyk, Economy
Minister Danylyshyn, First Deputy Chief of Staff to the President Shlapak, other senior
officials, representatives of parliament, the diplomatic community, financial sector, and think
tanks. Mr. Yakusha (OED) attended the discussions.
A separately published Selected Issues Paper provides background on two topics: (1) Two
Aspects of the Ukrainian’s Business Cycle; (2) Strengthening Ukraine’s Fiscal Framework.
A forthcoming Working Paper provides background on Resolving Large Contingent Fiscal
Liabilities.
The previous consultation was concluded on January 12, 2007. The conclusions of the
Executive Board’s discussions and country documents were made available at www.imf.org
on February 5, 2007.
XI. FSAP Participation
A joint World Bank-International Monetary Fund mission conducted an assessment of
Ukraine financial sector as part of the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) between
May 10–24, 2002. An update mission visited Ukraine between February 18–21, 2003, and
the Financial Sector Stability Assessment (FSSA) report (IMF Country Report No. 03/340)
was considered by the Executive Board on May 14, 2003. The observance of the following
standards and codes was assessed: Basel Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision;
Code of Good Practices on Transparency in Monetary and Financial Policies; CPSS Core
Principles for Systemically Important Payment Systems; OECD Principles for Corporate
Governance; Accounting and Auditing Practices; World Bank’s Principles and Guidelines for
Effective Insolvency and Creditor Rights System; and AML/CFT Methodology.
A further update mission visited Ukraine between June 11-22, 2007 and July 9-20, 2007. The
observance of the following standards and codes was assessed: Basel Core Principles for
Effective Banking Supervision; and IOSCO Core Principles of Securities Regulation. An
updated Financial Sector Stability Assessment (FSSA) is expected to be considered by the
Executive Board as part of the present Article IV consultation.

50
XII. ROSCS
A Data ROSC Module was conducted in April 3–17, 2002, and was considered by the
Executive Board on August 5, 2003 (IMF Country Report No. 03/256). A Fiscal
Transparency Module (experimental) was issued in September 1999, and an update in
April 2004 (IMF Country Report No. 04/98).

APPENDIX II: UKRAINE—RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK
(April 2008)
The IMF and World Bank staffs discussed their respective work programs during April 2008
(Table 1):
•

The World Bank presently has a lending program with Ukraine, and in the context of
a planned DPL III loan for late 2008, requested an updated IMF assessment of the
macroeconomic framework, inflation developments, and the alignment of the real
exchange rate with fundamentals. The IMF staff agreed to this.
•
The IMF staff foresaw surveillance and technical assistance activity in 2008-09, and
requested two key inputs from the bank covering targeted budget cuts and regulated
pricing reform. World Bank staff noted that they would be able to update previous
PER work on expenditure cuts in time for the 2009 budget, and that they could
provide inputs on regulated pricing in the energy and, possibly transportation sectors.
Macro critical sectoral issues:
•
Tax system reform. Both teams expect to be involved, the Bank through an on-going
policy dialogue and a review of draft legislation, and the Fund through desk review of
any new draft legislation. It was agreed that, as in the past, comments would be
shared and coordinated prior to their being forwarded to the government.
•
Expenditure policy reform. The World Bank has the lead on this issue in light of
recent PFR work. The IMF staff agreed to promote cutbacks identified within the
PFR, and updated by Bank staff, in the context of needed upcoming budget restraint.
•
Energy sector reform. The World Bank is expected to take the lead on this issue,
including identifying underpricing and near-term reforms to improve the process of
tariff setting. The teams agreed to discuss any proposed path for unwinding implicit
subsidies before presenting details to the government.
•
Pension reform. The World Bank is expected to take the lead on this issue, building
on its ongoing advice to the government. The teams agreed to discuss the timing of
introduction of second pillar against macroeconomic constraints and capital market
development conditions.
•
Broader tariff policy. The World Bank is expected to take the lead on this issue.
Analysis would be confined in 2008-09 to the transportation sector (with a focus on
the railways). The Bank staff agreed to keep IMF staff informed of tariff policy
recommendations arising from this analysis.

APPENDIX III: UKRAINE—RELATIONS WITH THE EBRD
(February 2008)
Ukraine joined the EBRD in 1992 and since then the EBRD has been active in supporting
Ukraine’s transformation toward a market economy. Successive country strategies have
focused on:
•
Financing private sector projects, developing the financial sector and rehabilitating
existing infrastructure (1992-93).
•
Strengthening the financial sector and supporting the needs of SMEs; promoting the
commercialization and structural reform of public utilities; and improving energy
efficiency and supporting the transition of the enterprise sector, especially in
agribusiness (2000).
•
Encouraging sustained momentum in privatization and commercialization of major
utilities; encouraging energy efficiency in both the state and private sectors; providing
funding through the banks to develop the small and medium business sector (SMEs);
and commencing funding for the agricultural sector through the provision of working
capital (2004).
•
Helping to improve the business climate and the competitiveness of the private sector;
strengthening the institutional capacity of the financial sector and increasing the level
of finance for micro enterprises and SMEs; and supporting the restructuring and
modernization of Ukraine’s road, railway, harbor, airport infrastructure, power and oil
& gas sectors (2005).
The EBRD’s main contribution has been the funding of projects in both the pubic and private
sectors, including some equity investments. This has been supported by a range of technical
cooperation activities and by engaging in policy dialogue with the government. The latter has
included membership of the Foreign Investment Advisory Council, but more especially, and
in a sector-focused manner, through the EBRD’s co-chairmanship of the Energy Sector Task
Force and the Transport Working group established between EBRD and the Ministry of
Transport.
In 2007 Ukraine rose to become the Bank’s 3rd largest exposure (after Russia and Poland),
representing approximately 8.3% of the Bank’s signed commitments as of 1 July 2007. This
is significant in as much as during the two previous strategy periods Ukraine was ranking
fifth in terms of exposure. As of 31 December 2007 the Bank had invested in 155 projects
with a net cumulative business volume (the “NCBV”) of € 3,1 billion, €with private sector
projects representing 72% of the NCBV and non sovereign operations representing 67% of
the NCBV. In terms of the sector distribution of Bank financing, 31% of the portfolio is in

57
Infrastructure, some 21% in General Industries, 20% in Specialised Industries (mostly
Agribusiness), 20% in Financial Institutions and the balance of 8% in Energy.
The current country strategy, approved in September 2007, outlines four main areas of
operational focus: (i) promoting higher efficiency, competitiveness and corporate governance
standards in the local private sector and assisting foreign direct investment; (ii) promoting the
development of the domestic capital markets and providing continued support to micro, small
and medium-sized private enterprises through dedicated long-term credit lines with partner
banks; (iii) promoting energy efficiency and security, environmental protection and
sustainable use of natural resources throughout all sectors of the economy; and (iv)
improving efficiency and reliability of key infrastructure, power generation, transmission and
distribution and of the oil and gas transport systems of Ukraine.
In terms of developing the local private sector and encouraging FDI, the Bank actively
participated in financing key foreign investors such as IKEA, but also cross-border
transactions with sponsors from countries of operations such as the Polish sanitary ware
producer Cersanit and Serbian Agroinvest. In the retail sector the Bank supported the
development of the leading local supermarket chain Furshet.
Program promoting the development of domestic capital markets, in 2007 the Bank
launched its Hryvnia Lending Programme with the successful establishment of KievPrime, a
credible local currency interbank index. The Bank completed successful syndications in favor
of local commercial banks, such as Kreditprom bank. Provision of mortgage finance for
Forum bank and finance for small and medium businesses continued through EBRD credit
lines to Mega bank. The EBRD intensified significantly its investments in the property sector
with loans to property developer Cantik and participation in two commercial property funds.
The strategic goal of supporting environmental protection and energy efficiency and
security related projects was pursued in 2007 with the industrial energy efficiency credit line
to UkrExim bank. The EBRD continued its support for local private business in the oil and
gas sector by financing downstream operator Galnaftogas and the exploration company
Cadogan Petroleum. A significant milestone in the activities of the Chernobyl Shelter Fund
and the Nuclear Safety Account – two major donor-funded programs administered by the
EBRD - was the signing of the contract for the construction of the new safe confinement for
Unit 4 and the contract for the completion of the dry fuel storage facility at Chernobyl
Nuclear Power Plant.
In the infrastructure area, important recent projects include the first municipal transport
projects for the Kiev Metropolitan and the Kiev Municipal bus company and the first
investment in the media and telecommunications sector in favor of Volia cable operator.

APPENDIX IV: UKRAINE—STATISTICAL ISSUES
Economic and financial data provided to the Fund are broadly adequate for surveillance, but
as discussed below there are some shortcomings, particularly in national accounts and
balance of payments data. The data module of the Report on the Observance of Standards
and Codes (ROSC) was prepared in 2002, and published on IMF’s website on
August 19, 2003. On January 10, 2003, the country became the first CIS country to subscribe
to the SDDS. The first international investment position was compiled by the National Bank
of Ukraine (NBU) in 2002. The country’s IFS page has been published since July 1996.
Real sector statistics
The 1993 SNA is the general framework for compiling national accounts. The classifications
used are largely in accordance with international standard. Source data are obtained from the
extensive survey program of the State Customs Service (SCS), supplemented with data from
administrative and other sources. The main survey report forms have been revised
significantly in recent years to bring them in line with the definitions, scope, and
classifications of the 1993 SNA, and new chart of accounts of enterprises. Significant
improvements have been introduced in the compilation and seasonal adjustment of quarterly
GDP.
A STA real sector mission in March 2005 found that the lack of appropriate price indices
hamper production of accurate long-term GDP volume series using the new classification of
economic activities adopted since 2001. There are still no proper quarterly price indices for
exports and imports, although the development of these indices has started.
The authorities agree that the methodology covering the informal economy needs to be
revised and improved. A further improvement of the data collection and production
environment is needed, in particular, through greater use of sample surveys, and improving
data flow management and processing. A STA mission is currently in the field, and it will
examine the recent improvements introduced in the compilation of currently available
national accounts series, having 200 as new base year, and will assist as needed to further
strengthen quality of the annual and quarterly accounts.
Government finance statistics
The Ministry of Finance (MOF) and State Treasury have made considerable progress in
compiling fiscal data. The Ministry publishes monthly data on operations of the central and
regional government within 25 days of the reference period. The economic classification of
transactions and the classification of outstanding debt are consistent with GFSM 1986.
From 2002, the functional classification has been consistent with GFSM 2001, the current
international standard. All central and local government transactions are recorded in the

59
Treasury Single Account. Starting in 2004, the authorities have provided STA with local
government expenditures, with latest data reported for the period through 2006.
The data ROSC report highlighted that government finance statistics are available monthly,
but do not provide the recommended coverage. The authorities have since reported central
and local government data for 1999-2006 in the GFSM 2001 format for publication in the
GFS Yearbook. However, timely publication of data from government extrabudgetary funds
such as the pension and insurance funds remains an issue.
Monetary and financial statistics
The data ROSC mission recommended that the timeliness of the analytical accounts of the
central bank be improved using the daily accounting records on monetary operations. SDDS
flexibility options are used for monetary data: the first for timeliness of the analytical
accounts of the banking sector and the second for the timeliness of the analytical accounts of
the central bank.
The authorities use the Standardized Report Forms (SRF) for reporting monetary data to STA
and EUR. In addition, data beginning from December 2001 have been converted into the
SRF framework and published in IFS Supplement since September 2006, and are available
online.
External sector statistics
The balance of payments statistics are compiled in broad conformity with the fifth edition of
the Balance of Payments Manual and are reported quarterly to STA with a lag of about ten
weeks. The principal data sources are the International Transaction Reporting System
(ITRS), surveys of enterprises, and administrative data.
Following the recommendations of the data ROSC mission, the authorities have expanded
the survey on inter-enterprise arrears to include information relevant for balance of payments
purposes. In July 2003, the NBU lowered the reporting thresholds for banks within the ITRS,
which resulted in a considerable increase in the coverage of transactions. A one-off survey of
migrant and related remittances is planned to be conducted in June 2008, and it is hoped that
this will be the basis for improving the quality of data on shuttle trade, compensation of
employees, workers’ remittances, and travel. Some weaknesses exist in the identification and
classification of financial flows stemming from capital flight. The authorities have made
progress in disseminating international reserves data and external debt statistics. The release
of monthly data on official reserves, in line with the Fund’s reserve template, started in mid2002, and those on quarterly external debt, in line with the External Debt Statistics Guide
(2003), started in September 2004.

60
Though the cooperation between different government agencies has improved in recent
years, problems still exist in coordinating the work of the NBU and the State Statistics
Committee, particularly regarding the statistics on services. An April 2008 Fund technical
assistance mission in external sector statistics focused mainly on the assessment of accuracy
and reliability of external sector statistics, specifically the coverage and recording of
financial transactions. The mission noted that data on trade in goods remain considerably
understated and a detailed study of errors in coverage and valuation of goods need to be
conducted. Some classification errors in financial flows were identified and their correction
should ensure consistency between financial flows and stocks. With financial support from
the World Bank, the NBU undertook a study of foreign exchange cash inflows during the
past ten years and used the results to estimate the stock of foreign exchange cash outside the
banking system. The data will be incorporated in the IIP for 2007.

62
Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
June 2, 2008
1.
Since the issuance of the staff report, more information about 2008 developments has
become available, the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) has continued to take steps toward
greater exchange rate flexibility, and the NBU has taken measures to give administrators of
problem banks more authority. This information does not change the thrust of the staff
appraisal.
2.
The economy has been stronger than expected, but imbalances have also grown. In
the first four months of 2008, real GDP growth remained robust at 6.2 percent year-on-year.
CPI inflation continued to climb, with the 12 month rate exceeding 30 percent in April. The
cumulative 12-month current account deficit is estimated to have risen to 5.4 percent of GDP
in March 2008, owing to surging imports. Since peaking in late March, eurobond spreads
have come down by as much as 50 basis points, while access to longer term external
financing has picked up, with some $850 million in direct and syndicated loans and
$400 million in eurobonds issued in May. These developments suggest that risks could be
tilting towards the high-growth and high-imbalances scenario laid out in the staff report.
3.
While the fiscal position has remained in surplus, spending pressures are mounting.
As in past years, the general government budget has recorded a surplus through late-May. An
inflation-driven surge in revenues has helped to pay for large expenditure increases
(50 percent during the first quarter of the year), but this revenue expansion along with
indexation requirements for wages and transfers has led to heavy pressure for a
supplementary budget. A recent constitutional court ruling which overturned the
government’s latest strategy for avoiding unfunded social mandates (amounting to some
9 percent of GDP) has placed additional pressure on the government, and new legislation is
in process to contain this risk.
4.
The NBU has allowed the exchange rate to fluctuate, and appreciate, outside the
previous narrow de facto band. In late May, it revalued the official exchange rate by
4 percent, and resumed intervening to bring market rates broadly into line with the new
official rate (but without announcing new bands). The NBU supervisory council (comprised
of parliamentarians and Presidential appointees) initially objected, but the head of the council
later indicated that a wider exchange rate band may soon be sanctioned and a new
mechanism would be introduced to keep the official exchange rate in line with market rates.
These changes would be in line with staff advice. Needed supporting actions, including
public and decisive government support for regime transition, clear NBU communication
about policies, and cancellation of the fx tax, remain as enumerated in the staff report.
5.
The NBU has amended regulations governing the financial administration of problem
banks. Administrators now have broader rights to seek buyers for banks failing to meet
minimum liquidity requirements. This is in line with advice in the FSAP update.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2008 Article IV Consultation with
Ukraine
On June 2, 2008, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Ukraine.1
Background
Growth remained strong in 2007. Real GDP growth reached 7.6 percent, on par with
the average since 2000, and in line with other CIS countries. Production and
investment have been resilient despite an uncertain political climate and supply-side
shocks (a doubling of imported natural gas prices since 2005 and a poor 2007
agricultural harvest).
Rapid domestic demand growth pushed the economy beyond its capacity in 2007–
08, leading to accelerating inflation. The demand expansion, fed by fiscal and
incomes policies and a capital-inflow driven surge in money and credit growth, in
combination with rising food and energy prices, gradually lifted CPI inflation to over
30 percent by end-April 2008. Core inflation has also risen, nominal wage growth is
very high, and inflation expectations have drifted up.
The current account deficit continued to deteriorate in 2007, due to very strong
domestic demand growth, but it remains broadly consistent with fundamentals. The
deterioration has occurred despite terms of trade gains, which may reverse as gas
prices rise and if steel prices revert toward their historical trend. If domestic demand

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return
to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive
Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board,
summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's
authorities.

64
and inflation are not contained, a further erosion of cost competitiveness would
move the hryvnia toward real overvaluation.
Capital inflows, including FDI, remain strong, but private external debt and debt
rollover have risen sharply. The economy has become more sensitive to balancesheet risks and deteriorating global liquidity conditions. However, some external debt
may be held by Ukrainians (i.e. misrecorded) and some offset by unrecorded foreign
exchange assets in Ukraine. International reserves remain at comfortable levels.
Banks’ credit risks have increased, reflecting very high lending growth, including in
foreign exchange to unhedged borrowers. Surging liabilities to non-residents,
although in part reflecting the presence of foreign banks, point to growing liquidity
risks. And, with house prices high relative to incomes, credit risks on mortgages
have grown.
The effects on Ukraine of international financial market turbulence have begun to
recede. Reflecting Ukraine’s vulnerabilities, external spreads rose sharply beginning
in mid-2007 and euro-bond issuance dried up. However, eurobond spreads have
been falling since late-March 2008, while access of banks and corporates to longer
term external financing has resumed, facilitating rollover of debt maturities.
The fiscal stance has been procyclical. Nominal spending has risen by over
30 percent a year since 2003, reflecting rapidly rising public-sector wages and social
transfers and, in early 2008, partial restitution of Soviet-era deposits that had been
wiped out by hyperinflation in the early 1990s. General government deficits have
been kept moderate, as spending growth has been paid for by inflationary revenue
windfalls. This has allowed the public debt to decline to just over 10 percent of GDP.
Monetary conditions have tightened somewhat of late. The National Bank of Ukraine
(NBU) stepped up sterilization and imposed new reserve requirements on banks’
foreign borrowing beginning in late 2007, instituted new prudential measures in early
2008, and since March 2008 has allowed the exchange rate to appreciate outside
the previous de facto Hrv/$ 5.00-5.06 band. Excess banking system liquidity has
fallen considerably, interest rates have risen sharply, notably on the interbank
market, and lending in foreign currency has slowed significantly. Nevertheless, real
interest rates remain negative and overall credit growth is still very high—76 percent
year-on-year in March.

65
Progress has been made on the structural reform agenda, but much remains to be
done. WTO accession was a significant achievement, but compared to other
transition economies Ukraine lags in energy efficiency, internal price liberalization
and has notable weaknesses in its business environment, especially in the area of
tax administration. Development of the high-potential agricultural sector remains
constrained by the lack of a market for agricultural land.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended Ukraine’s continued strong economic growth and
increased overall resilience to shocks. They noted that reserves have increased
substantially, the fiscal position is sustainable, the financial sector appears well
capitalized and profitable, and foreign direct investment is strong. These
developments would support Ukraine’s considerable long-term growth potential, the
realization of which will require the steady pursuit of sound macroeconomic policies
and growth-enhancing structural reforms.
Directors also expressed concern that some macroeconomic vulnerabilities have
increased. Significantly higher inflation and a wider external current account deficit
reflect volatility in world commodity prices, but mainly strong domestic demand
growth. Directors cautioned that rapid domestic lending growth, including in foreign
exchange to unhedged borrowers, and high house prices have increased credit
risks. They welcomed the authorities’ efforts to mitigate liquidity risks arising from
growing external borrowing and debt rollover needs in the context of the global
financial market turbulence.
Directors noted uncertainties regarding growth prospects, but agreed that further
tightening of policies will be required to buttress macroeconomic stability. In this
context, they welcomed the authorities’ intention to tighten fiscal policy, which will be
critical for restraining domestic demand and reducing inflationary pressures. They
encouraged the authorities to aim for a near-balanced budget—or tighter—in 2008.
At the same time, Directors considered that, should growth slow significantly and
inflationary pressures ease, a larger fiscal deficit could be accommodated if
financing is available. Directors also saw merit in taking steps to strengthen the fiscal
framework more generally to improve fiscal policy formulation and assessment, in
particular by broadening fiscal coverage, and adopting a medium-term fiscal
framework.
To achieve the desired fiscal tightening, Directors suggested that growth in social
transfers will need to be reined in, and increases in minimum wages and public
sector wages scaled back. In addition, further restitutions of depreciated Soviet-era
bank deposits should be spread over a number of years. To shore up revenues,
administration of the value added tax should be strengthened, and the tax itself

66
preserved. Tax cuts, while desirable as part of an overall reduction in the size of
government, should be fully offset with spending cuts or tax base broadening. Gas
prices should be fully passed through to final consumers, with vulnerable groups
protected by better-targeted social programs.
Directors underscored the importance of a tight monetary stance to fight inflation.
Directors generally considered that a shift to a more flexible exchange rate would
enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy, and welcomed the 2008 monetary
guidelines, which call for a gradual transition to a flexible exchange rate and
ultimately to inflation targeting. They were encouraged by the authorities’ recent
actions to allow greater exchange rate flexibility, and encouraged the authorities to
communicate clearly and consistently to the markets and the public about the move.
Directors generally felt that if recent flexibility were allowed to continue in the context
of a wider official trading band, it would help underscore the two-way risk to
domestic borrowing in foreign currency. A few Directors were not persuaded of the
desirability of exchange rate flexibility leading to inflation targeting. Directors
stressed the importance of developing foreign exchange and money markets, in
particular noting a weak interest rate channel of monetary policy transmission. While
some Directors noted the uncertainties surrounding the assessment of the current
level of the real exchange rate, Directors generally agreed that the real exchange
rate appears to be broadly consistent with fundamentals.
Directors stressed that decisive government support for a new inflation targeting
regime will be fundamental, particularly in the form of a clear inflation-targeting
mandate and operational independence for the monetary authorities. It would also
be important for the government to abolish the tax on foreign exchange transactions,
securitize its debt to the National Bank of Ukraine, issue more public debt in
domestic currency, and further liberalize domestic prices to provide monetary policy
maximum leverage over inflation.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ progress in implementing the FSAP
recommendations, noting that financial indicators have improved further. However,
they noted that Ukraine’s financial sector vulnerabilities remain. In this context, they
supported recent measures to identify bank owners, raise minimum capital
requirements, improve risk management practices, and curb banks’ foreign
borrowing. They encouraged efforts to fully develop consolidated supervision,
improve banks’ stress testing and risk management capabilities, intensify on-site
examinations, and impose stronger prudential requirements on banks with
deteriorating liquidity positions.

67
Directors suggested that productivity-enhancing structural reforms should play a
significant role in boosting growth and restraining inflation over the medium term. In
particular, they looked forward to the positive impact of Ukraine’s WTO accession on
enhancing market competition and economic efficiency. They encouraged the
authorities to push forward in improving the business environment and the legal
framework.

Statement by Mr. Yakusha, Alternate Executive Director for Ukraine
June 2, 2008

My Ukrainian authorities would like to thank staff for the useful discussions. They appreciate
the Fund’s advice and the presentation of the numerous topics covered in the Selected Issues
report. In general, the authorities considered the staff appraisal helpful and the consultations
with the Fund productive. Major recommendations are now in the process of implementation.
Some nuances in views remain on part of the FSSA text that has not been properly updated,
and on the assumptions for external demand used for forecasting the baseline scenario.
Economic growth in 2008 has so far stood at above 6 percent with a trend of acceleration,
despite negative contribution of the construction sector, already affected by policy tightening.
Increased external demand for Ukrainian exports confirms the validity of the growth
assumptions by the authorities. So far industry growth stood at 8 percent with machinery
growing at 32.9 percent, reflecting positive changes in the production structure. Profitability
of businesses has also increased, while capital investment grew by over 10 percent in the first
quarter. Volumes of trade increased substantially. In the first quarter domestic trade grew by
15 percent, exports by 28 percent, and imports by 44.5 percent. The latter figure reflects not
only rising prices for imported energy and a genuine growth in consumer imports, but also
the still high but now decreasing volume of non-reported activity. Since the beginning of the
year revenues from customs increased 1.8-fold, mostly due to modernization of the custom
procedures and enforcement of the measures to fight smuggling, which have been
strengthened by the new government.
The global financial turmoil has so far affected Ukraine only to a marginal extent. In the first
quarter of 2008, compared to the same quarter of 2007, external financing increased
substantially for both the corporate and financial sectors despite an almost complete absence
of Eurobond issuance by Ukrainian entities. In spite of that, the share of longer-term external
financing increased, and as of May 1, 2008 it has exceeded 50 percent, while the share of
interbank credit has declined, contrary to the FSSA’s description. Since August of 2007 the
trend of faster growth of foreign currency denominated consumer loans as compared to loans
in national currency, has also reversed. During the first four months of this year, the growth
rate of consumer loans in the national currency was twice the growth rate of foreign currency
denominated loans. Volatility in the domestic stock market has notably increased, but
without a substantial downside trend. There has also been some occasional volatility in the
interbank credit market, but this trend of reduced excess liquidity is associated with domestic
policy tightening, and notably with substantial accumulation of resources in government
accounts. Market players are estimating the prospects for Ukraine with diverging views. One
major rating agency has changed the outlook from positive to stable, another announced
plans to improve the outlook. Spreads for Ukrainian entities increased to a considerable
extent, probably reflecting existing undeniable political uncertainties. At the same time FDIs

70
continued to increase. In the first four months of this year FDIs increased overall by
11.4 percent to a total of over USD 41 billion. At the same time direct investments of
Ukrainian companies abroad continue to increase, though at a slower pace, and now total
USD 6.1 billion.
The authorities agree with the staff’s assessment of inflation acceleration as a major threat to
stability, growth, and social standards, and the internal discussion in the country about the
reasons behind the high inflation is intense. The culprits frequently mentioned are the
continuing global commodity price boom, which affects, in a very open economy, both
export and import prices, the substantial increases in prices for imported energy, the growth
in social transfers and budgetary wages, which exceed productivity growth. Structural
rigidities and weak enforcement of the competition policy hamper the supply response,
which is compounded by a bad year for Ukraine’s agriculture in 2007. It has also been
mentioned that previous governments tried to slow down price increases during the years of
three national elections in a row; that food occupies a much higher share in the CPI basket
than in neighboring countries; and that the relatively stable nominal exchange rate to the
falling US dollar ceased to be helpful. Analysis of the core inflation and aggregate demand
pressures as well as a worsening of inflationary expectations according to various surveys
conducted by the NBU and the private sector, confirm the staff’s diagnosis.
The authorities agree that taming aggregate demand is important for reducing demand
pressures and for preventing inflationary expectations from getting entrenched. The joint
NBU-Government plan of anti-inflationary measures that is currently being implemented
reflects also the Fund’s advice. The main emphasis is put on allowing a soft landing of the
economy by carefully slowing down aggregate demand through tightening of both fiscal and
monetary policy, alongside market interventions from government commodity reserves and
other supply side measures. Refinancing rates have been increased, and overall monetary
conditions tightened also by more stringent requirements for capital adequacy, increased
reserve requirements, and better provisioning against possible losses. The requirements for
assessing borrowers’ ability to repay credits have also been tightened, as were overall credit
standards, collateral valuations, etc. Mortgage financing has been especially affected by these
measures, and the previously explosive growth in housing prices has slowed down.
The most important policy change in recent months was the gradual withdrawal of the NBU
from the foreign exchange market that allowed the interbank market nominal exchange rate
to the US dollar to appreciate by over 10 percent in two months since mid March. Both cash
and offshore hryvnia markets demonstrated even stronger appreciation at some point. Most
recently, the interbank exchange rate has been fluctuating at around 6-8 percent above its
level at the beginning of the year. The NBU also adjusted by about 4 percent (so far) the
official rate used for accounting purposes and for a small volume of the NBU transactions
with the government. There has been some controversy as well as a parliamentary discussion
after the exchange rate sustained its movement outside the indicative band approved by the

71
parliament for 2008, but the NBU continued to exercise its authority over monetary policy
quite independently, a stance supported by the government. The government on its part
limited budgetary spending to some extent despite substantial growth in revenues - this
year’s budget has been consistently executed with small surpluses of up to 0.5 percent of
GDP so far. Cutting planned social spending increases was not feasible though, also because
of court rulings.
It is also worth noting that unlike the measures implemented by some other major
agricultural exporters, in Ukraine the authorities have eased and later abolished restrictions
and quotas on grain and other food exports, thus contributing, inter allia, to the helpful in a
current global situation decline in wheat prices.
Implementation of the anti-inflation agenda is taking place in a not so easy political
environment, where parliament had spent a lot of time on disagreements over non-economic
issues at the expense of considering and implementing a structural reform agenda. As the
authorities indicated during the consultations, success in fighting inflation also requires
addressing the rigidities that are hampering supply side and competition. Reforms have been
accelerated in areas not requiring parliamentary approval – modernization of the customs and
VAT administration accelerated with electronic declarations and greater automation, and
VAT arrears have been reduced substantially. The regulatory regime and accounting
requirements are being simplified and other investment climate improvements are on their
way – public auctions for access to non-agricultural land and for the exploration of natural
resources, and privatization procedures also organized in a public auction format with price
offered as the exclusive criterion. Budgetary risks stemming from imperfections in the
natural gas market have been addressed and the financial situation of the Naftogaz of Ukraine
company has improved.
After many years of negotiations Ukraine officially joined the WTO on May 16. The move
received unprecedented parliamentary support with 411 out of 450 votes. It is expected that
WTO membership will not only accelerate trade, but will increase much needed competition
on domestic markets, thus contributing to lower production costs. In line with WTO
obligations, certain import duties have been substantially reduced recently. Finally, after
approving the new law on the Cabinet of Ministers which clarifies the authority of the
executive branches, the parliament has started considering a new labor code, a customs code
and other pieces of economic reform legislation. Hopefully, modernization of the banking
and corporate legislation will also be considered soon.
The National Bank of Ukraine has tightened policies to a greater extent than reflected in the
main staff report based on the end-March data. Since the beginning of 2008, base money had
increased by 1.9 percent on May 26 compared with a 7.5 percent increase during the same
period of 2007. The NBU also gradually increased, from 10.1 to 15.2 percent, its actual
refinancing rate, while average credit rates increased so far to over 17 percent. Prudential

72
measures increased banks’ obligatory reserves from HRV 9.7 billion to over HRV 11 billion
in January-April alone. All monetary and prudential measures combined had recently slowed
credit growth somewhat – at the beginning of the year credit grew by about 4 percent a
month, in April its growth slowed to 2.9 percent, while so far in May (as of May 26) it was
1.5 percent. In general the extremely high credit growth rates in Ukraine are better understood if longer term dynamics and an initially low base as well as a substantial volume of
non-reported economic activity and incomes are taken into account. As such, the growth
rates of consumer loans have reached their maximum of over 100 percent in 2006-2007 and
since then have been gradually declining.
As stated in the FSSA, Ukraine implements practically all FSAP recommendations. The
authorities do not fully share the description presented in the FSSA, as the trends increasing
the risks are emphasized stronger than the measures already implemented to address these
risks. In particular, dollarization trends are highlighted, while in practice the opposite has
started to happen, also as a result to the measures implemented by the NBU. Not all newly
introduced prudential requirements to address the quality of credit operations, especially in
the area of consumer loans, are taken into account. In particular, credit classification criteria
have been tightened, thus increasing the required provisioning. Adequacy of the regulatory
capital is now calculated under more stringent criteria and also taking into account foreign
exchange risks and also longer term liquidity risks, thus effectively achieving the same
macroeconomic result as the overall increase in capital adequacy would do, but also with
positive externalities for risk management. Obligatory reserves were introduced against loans
from abroad, and, together with the additionally increased provisioning against loans
extended in foreign currency, have started to reduce the share of foreign exchange loans. The
NBU enforces these and other stricter prudential norms. Mismatches in over 1-year maturity
of assets/liabilities have decreased by 20 percent in the last four months due to the new
prudential requirements. The share of long-term deposits has also increased this year (from
24 to 27 percent). Financial sector corporate governance has been improved (all banks are
supposed to be open joint-stock companies with regularly reported and published lists of
owners). Minimal statutory banking capital has been doubled to Euro 10 mln, twice the EU
norm.
Foreign banks which increased their presence in Ukraine to just under 50 percent in
regulatory capital, have improved the level of banking services and also the overall level of
risk management. At the same time, while competing for a market share, foreign banks have
this year generated so far over 62 percent of the total growth in consumer loans. The NBU is
carefully monitoring all developments on the external liabilities side, first of all those of a
short-term nature – all foreign loans are reported and registered in Ukraine - and the central
bank is ready to implement adequate measures in case any of the risks mentioned in the
FSSA would start to materialize. Increased flexibility of the exchange rate (in line with staff
recommendations) is expected to eventually reduce some financial risks, will definitely
contribute to lower inflation, and will likely strengthen the so far relatively weak trends

73
toward de-dollarization. The way the greater flexibility will affect trade and capital flows
remains to be seen.
As was clearly stated by the NBU officials, the central bank is not really committed to any
particular exchange rate level. It may smooth only temporary fluctuations, and will not resist
either strengthening or weakening of the exchange rate if fundamental trends are to change
substantially. In particular, NBU has publicly not ruled out the possibility of some weakening
of the exchange rate in case terms of trade will change in line with staff expectations
described in the SI report. In this light, the de facto exchange rate regime in Ukraine has been
more closely aligned to the de-jure exchange rate regime, which remained a managed float
(despite smaller fluctuations) in recent years.
