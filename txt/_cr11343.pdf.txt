ST. VINCENT AND THE
GRENADINES
STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2011 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
October 13 2011

KEY ISSUES
Setting: In addition to the adverse impact of the global slowdown and higher commodity
prices, St. Vincent and the Grenadines was hit by two successive natural disasters in the last
twelve months. As a result, real GDP contracted by a cumulative 4.7 percent since 2007 and
is expected to remain slightly negative this year. Going forward, growth is expected to
improve gradually toward its potential, but significant downside risks remain, largely related
to developments in the global economy.
Creating fiscal space and ensuring debt sustainability: The fiscal deficit in 2011 is
expected to be smaller than last year, mainly reflecting cuts in capital spending to offset
shortfalls in revenues and external loans. Over the medium-term, the authorities remain
committed to generating a primary surplus averaging about 2 percent of GDP by 2016. A
more ambitious fiscal consolidation path would allow for a faster reduction in debt and
would help building cushions against future exogenous shocks.
Safeguarding against financial stability risks: The authorities are encouraged to closely
monitor developments in both the banking and non-banking sectors, including contagion
risks from weaknesses in the regional financial sector. It is also urgent to establish the
Single Regulatory Unit and ensure effective supervision of the non-banking sector,
especially given the deterioration in balance sheets at some of the institutions in this sector.
Ensuring sustainable growth: Policies should focus on enhancing competitiveness and
improving the business climate, including easing access to credit as well as improving
infrastructure and labor skills.
Exchange Rate Regime: St. Vincent and the Grenadines is a member of the
Eastern Caribbean Currency Union, which has a common central bank and a common
currency and operates as a currency board. Since July 1976, the Eastern Caribbean dollar
has been pegged to the US dollar at the rate of EC$2.7 per US dollar. St. Vincent and the
Grenadines has accepted the obligation of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 and maintains an
exchange system free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current
international transactions.

ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES

CONTEXT
1.
St. Vincent and the Grenadines was
hit by two natural disasters in the last
twelve months, in addition to being
adversely affected by the continued
slowdown in the global economy. Following
robust growth of 5 percent per annum during
2002–07, the global slowdown and the rise in
food and fuel prices resulted in a significant
contraction of economic activity. In 2008, real
GDP growth contracted by 0.6 percent,
followed by a contraction of 2.3 percent in
2009. A drought in the first half of 2010
followed by Hurricane Tomas in October, led
to a decline in economic activity by a further
1.8 percent.1 In April this year, torrential rains,
floods and landslides took a toll on agriculture
and infrastructure. The outlook for growth
remains negative for this year.

Public debt has risen and the scope
for countercyclical fiscal policy is
constrained. Unlike many developing
countries which entered the crisis with strong
public finances, St. Vincent and the Grenadines
had been running deficits for several years and

The authorities have revised down their growth
numbers for 2008 and 2009 from -0.3 and -0.6 percent
to -0.6 and -2.3 percent, respectively, compared to

by 2007 public debt had risen to 55.7 percent
of GDP, compared with 43.3 percent of GDP in
1996.2 With increased expenditure pressures
and a decline in GDP in the wake of the global
slowdown, the structural primary deficit
worsened from 2.3 percent of GDP in 2008 to
3.7 percent of GDP in 2010, and public debt
increased by a further ten percentage points to
66.8 percent.
3.
Against this backdrop, the Article IV
consultation focused on policies to address
the underlying structural vulnerabilities and
increase the country’s resilience to shocks.
Along with other donors, the Fund provided
significant emergency assistance to St. Vincent
and the Grenadines to address the immediate
balance of payments need arising from the
impact of the global financial crisis and the
two recent natural disasters.3 The key policy
challenge facing the government now is to

mitigate the impact of the global financial crisis, US$3.26

Rapid Credit Facility (RCF) to deal with the impact of
Hurricane Tomas, and US$2.0 million (15 percent of
quota) under the RCF in July 2011 to deal with the

impact of torrential rains and floods.

Preliminary indicators suggest that
economic activity remains sluggish. The two
main sources of growth—tourism and
FDI-related construction—continue to be
affected by the slowdown and heightened
uncertainty in advanced countries. On the
domestic side, the private sector remains
subdued as banks remain wary of lending and
the scope for fiscal stimulus is limited by the
government’s financing constraints. That said,
an expected rebound in agricultural exports in
the second half, and some reconstruction
activity, are expected to help moderate the
decline in activity.

pass-through from higher food and fuel prices
(with a combined weight of 34 percent in the
CPI) resulted in headline inflation accelerating
to about 2.8 percent (y/y) by June this year
compared to about ½ percent at the end of
last year. Meanwhile, core inflation remained
unchanged at 0.6 percent since December last
year.
6.
Despite lower revenues, the overall
fiscal deficit for the first seven months was
broadly in line with staff projections at the
time of the July RCF. External disbursements
were significantly lower-than-projected due
partly to delays in project implementation and
also due to slower flows of pledged assistance.
The shortfall was offset by significant cuts in
capital expenditures, while spending on wages
(including temporary workers hired for cleanup
and rehabilitation) and social assistance were
somewhat higher, mainly to meet some of the

7.
The current account is expected to
narrow this year, largely reflecting lower
imports. After declining by 12 percent last
year, exports are expected to pickup reflecting
a recovery in agricultural production and
strong growth in manufacturing. Despite a
higher import bill for food and fuel, overall
imports are expected to continue to decline in
the second half reflecting the slowdown in
economic activity, decline in FDI, delays in
project implementation and cuts in capital
spending.

8.
Monetary aggregates remain flat;
financial sector soundness indicators
suggest continued weaknesses in balance
sheets. The year-on-year growth in real private
sector credit and broad money was nearly flat
as of June 2011, reflecting banks’ wariness to
make new loans in an uncertain environment.
Banking sector NPLs decreased somewhat
from 8½ percent at end-December 2010 to
7½ percent at end-June 2011, partly reflecting
clearance of the government’s outstanding
loans (banks have also restructured private
loans, although the information available does
not point to a significant magnitude).6 While
some credit unions have stepped up efforts to
monitor loan servicing, average NPLs in the
sector remain high at about 8 percent. Despite
some improvements in governance problems
at the building and loan association (B&LA)
after it was brought under the direct
supervision of the Ministry of Finance, half of
its loan portfolio remains overdue. Moreover,
two credit unions and the B&LA still have
exposure to BAICO and CLICO (see below).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

As part of the precondition for the sale of the
National Commercial Bank (NCB) last year to a
St. Lucia based bank holding company (the
government still holds 29 percent of the shares), the
government was required to clear a significant part of
its NPLs on NCB’s balance sheet.

Efforts continue to help resolve the
fallout from the failure of the two insurance
companies, BAICO and CLICO. A Health
Insurance Fund was set up to settle medical
claims of BAICO’s policyholders. An
announcement was recently made inviting
interested parties to bid for BAICO’s life

insurance policy portfolio and discussions are
also ongoing on how to compensate BAICO’s
annuity holders. On CLICO, following the
appointment of the Judicial Manager (JM) by
Barbados, a JM has been appointed by the
government to assess the balance sheet of the
local CLICO branch.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
10.
The outlook for near-term growth
remains subdued, but economic activity is
expected to recover gradually over the
medium term. Real GDP growth is expected
to recover somewhat in the second half of this
year, reflecting a modest pickup in
construction activity and agricultural
production, although growth will be slightly
negative in 2011. Next year, growth is
expected to get a boost from construction at
the airport, donor-financed projects that were
approved following the natural disasters and
from the opening of two new universities. Over
the medium term, the economy is expected to
improve toward its potential growth of
3½ percent, but the recovery to potential
output is slower and more protracted than
expected at the time of the July RCF, reflecting
the downward revision in the outlook for

advanced countries’ growth. On the price
front, inflation is expected to moderate to its
long term historical path of 2.5 percent,
anchored by the currency board arrangement.
11.
However, risks to growth are
squarely on the downside. The main risks
include slower-than-expected disbursements
from donors which could undermine
reconstruction activity, continued weakness in
external demand due to delayed recovery in
advanced economies, an erosion of confidence
caused by possible spillovers from financial
sector problems, including in the region, and
protracted delays in resolving the fallout from
BAICO and CLICO. Moreover, as seen in the
last twelve months, natural disasters continue
to be another potential source of risk (See
Box 1).

POLICY DISCUSSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The global financial and economic crisis combined with the recent natural disasters have
brought to the fore the underlying weaknesses in the economy and the urgent need to
address these vulnerabilities to ensure sustainable growth. Given the policy limitations in
the context of the currency board arrangement, the burden of adjustment falls squarely
on fiscal policy and structural reforms.

A. Creating Fiscal Space and Ensuring Debt Sustainability
12.
Financing constraints in 2011 will
result in a more contractionary fiscal stance
than expected earlier. Lower-than-expected
revenues and the delay in the disbursement on
a large expected concessional loan (about
2½ percent of GDP) will result in a significant
shortfall and limit fiscal spending this year. The
authorities have significantly revised down the
capital budget (to half of what was expected at
the time of the July RCF) and limiting transfers
to state owned enterprises.7 However, this will
still leave a shortfall of about 1 percent of GDP
which would be met by higher-than-planned
borrowing on the regional securities market
(RGSM). The overall deficit is expected to end
the year at 3.2 percent of GDP, 1.4 percentage
points of GDP lower than projected at the time
of the July RCF. While agreeing that some
additional borrowing from the RGSM may
become necessary, staff emphasized the need
to contain the already high debt and debt
service (public sector debt is expected to rise
by 2.4 percentage points of GDP this year).
Staff also pointed out that enforcing tax
compliance and reducing ad-hoc exemptions
could generate additional savings.
13.
The authorities reiterated their
commitment, in line with the July RCF, to
generate primary surpluses in the range of
2 percent of GDP by 2016 to put debt on a
downward trajectory and build financial
buffers. Under the baseline scenario, the
primary balance will deteriorate somewhat
next year, before starting to improve from
7

Capital spending is expected to decline to
3.7 percent of GDP this year from 7.2 percent of GDP
in 2009.

1/ Compared to the 2011 level

2013. The larger fiscal deficit reflects higher
capital spending, including co-financing for
donor financed projects that were delayed
from the second half of this year to next year
(many of these are related to rehabilitation of
infrastructure destroyed by the two natural
disasters). At the same time, there was broad
agreement between staff and authorities that a
number of measures to enhance revenues and
rationalize current expenditures will have to be
implemented over the next few years to help
generate the planned primary surpluses and
reduce debt.
Revenue measures:
-

Introduce market-based property taxes: The
authorities reiterated their commitment to
introduce these in the 2012 budget. The
Inland Revenue Department (IRD)
estimates that moving to a market value
system could double the collection of
property taxes.

-

Enhance revenue collections: While there
have been significant improvements in tax
collections since the mid-2000s, reflecting
the introduction of VAT and excise taxes,
and tax administration reforms, there is
room for further improvement. In
particular, three areas were identified for
action: (i) reviewing and streamlining
ad-hoc exemptions; (ii) strengthening the

ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES

enforcement capacity of the IRD, especially
the recently established Large Taxpayer
Unit (LTU); and (iii) increased accountability
of the customs departments including to
address the concerns on clearance delays
by the private sector. The authorities have
requested technical assistance from
CARTAC in these areas.

-

More targeted social assistance: There are
about thirty social assistance programs.
While most of these programs have aimed
at reducing poverty and mitigating the
impact of the crisis, including on
unemployment (the unemployment rate is
about 25–30 percent), the lack of a central
registry of beneficiaries makes it difficult to
monitor who gets the benefits. Also,
programs are available to all irrespective of
income levels. Staff encouraged the
authorities to move to a central registry
system and recommended the use of cost
recovery principles to the extent possible,
while continuing to subsidize the poor and
vulnerable groups. The authorities agreed
that there is scope for improving efficiency,
but argued that the programs broadly
cover those in need.

-

Rationalize spending on goods and services:
The authorities and staff agreed that
ongoing measures to improve
procurement, use solar power, cut
non-essential travel, and reduce the
number of government vehicles, would
help to generate some savings.

Expenditure measures:
-

Reduce the wage bill: Real wages have
increased an average of 2½ percent per
year over the last 5 years and the wage bill
is among the highest in the region. The
authorities agreed that anchoring average
wage increases to inflation could generate
significant savings.

-

Limit transfers to state-owned enterprises
(SOEs). With technical assistance from
CARTAC, the authorities have been making
efforts to improve the governance and
monitoring of SOEs to contain potential
fiscal risks.8 The authorities pointed out
that privatization of the NCB (and the
consequent elimination of the NCB as a
financing source) has reduced a potential
source of financing for SOEs and reduced
fiscal risks for the central government.
Authorities agreed that further
streamlining was necessary and agreed to
reenergize the Oversight Committee to
ensure systematic reporting, closer
monitoring and increased accountability
from SOEs.

8

There are around 28 SOEs in St. Vincent and the
Grenadines. The central government provides
significant transfers to most SOEs and also guarantees
their loans. As of 2010, SOE’s debt stood at
11.6 percent of GDP, a 50 percent increase from its
level in 2006.

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

14.
While increasing in the short term,
the public sector debt is projected to revert
to a sustainable trajectory over the medium
term, and the risk of external debt distress
is moderate. After peaking at 72 percent by
2013, the public sector debt-to-GDP ratio is
projected to fall to 54 percent of GDP by 2020,
below the ECCU’s 2009 “Eight Point
Stabilization Program” threshold of 60 percent,
driven by the authorities’ commitment to fiscal
consolidation. That said, St. Vincent and the
Grenadines’ risk of external debt distress
remains moderate, similar to the assessment at
the time of the RCF in February 2011.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 9

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES

15.
Staff also discussed the merits of a
more ambitious fiscal adjustment scenario
which could help to reduce debt faster and
allow a more rapid build-up of financial
buffers to counter exogenous shocks. The
significant disruptions caused by the global
crisis, the hurricane and the torrential rains all
point to the inherent vulnerabilities in the
economy. In addition, the ongoing financial
sector problems in the region could have
significant fiscal consequences and possible
adverse impact on the regional securities
market, a significant source of financing for
St. Vincent and the Grenadines. The mission,
therefore, highlighted the need to improve the
country’s resilience to shocks and build
financial buffers, including to address potential
spillover effects from regional and global
developments and to develop contingency
plans in case financing in the region dries up.
In this regard, the mission underscored that a
debt target of 45-50 percent of GDP, similar to
that of other emerging and developing market
economies, may be more suitable. In this
context, staff pointed out two additional areas
that could help to both generate such savings
and at the same time improve the efficiency of
the public service. First, pension reforms
including a gradual increase in the

contribution rate and the retirement age,
aligning the NIS and Public Service (PS)
pension system retirement ages, and
considering a merger of the two systems could
provide significant savings as well as make the
system more robust (see Box 2). Second, civil
sector reforms, including introduction of a
performance based system, could help to
reduce costs and improve the efficiency of the
civil service. The authorities agreed on the
merits of the structural reforms and indicated
that they are exploring these areas to generate
further savings. That said, they argued that the
proposed lower debt-to-GDP target may be
too ambitious, given the competing claims on
the budget and the role the government plays
in the economy.
16.
Staff welcomes the authorities’
commitment to avoid external commercial
borrowing. In this context, staff urged the
authorities to continue to finance the airport
project from a combination of grants,
concessional loans, and land sales. At the same
time, staff underscored the need to cut current
spending and ensure that, in addition to the
airport, other priority capital projects are
undertaken.

B. Improving the Medium-Term Outlook for the External Current Account
17.
The large external current account
deficits are not sustainable over the longer
term. The external current account deficit has
increased six fold since 2000, financed largely
by FDI. Going forward, such large deficits
cannot be sustained indefinitely as net inflows
are likely to decline when loan amortization
increases and profit transfers begin to kick in.
Export competitiveness, especially in the
service sector, will be key to sustain import

An assessment of the real effective
exchange rate (REER) using the standard

results, but overall suggests some
overvaluation (see Box 3). The equilibrium
real exchange rate approach suggests there is
no misalignment. On the other hand, the

19.
In addition to fiscal reforms, staff
underscored that given the quasi-currency
board arrangement, the required
adjustment in the current account will have
to come through structural reforms. The
authorities argued that a number of initiatives
currently under way—development of agroprocessing for export markets by VincyFresh, a
public-private business venture, completion of
two large hotel projects and the Argyle
International Airport—would boost exports of
goods and services and improve the external
position of the country.

C. Addressing Risks and Vulnerabilities in the Financial Sector
Banking Sector
20.
Banking sector soundness
indicators underscore the need for close
monitoring. Banks’ liquidity and capital
adequacy ratios are reportedly above the
ECCB’s prudential guidelines, NPLs have
remained consistently high since 2008 and
profitability has declined significantly.
21.
The mission underscored the need
to monitor the banking sector very closely
including developments in the regional
indigenous banks. While the banking sector

in St. Vincent and the Grenadines is mostly
foreign-owned9 and dominated by banks with
parent companies outside the ECCU region,
headwinds from problems at other
indigenous banks in the region could
potentially result in a loss of confidence and
severe disruption of economic activity. Staff
stressed the need to enhance monitoring of
cross-institution and cross-border holdings, in
addition to bank specific soundness
indicators. Staff also underscored the need for

Non-Banking Financial Sector
22.
The supervision of the non-banking
sector is spread out across a number of
agencies. The non-banking financial sector is
comprised of credit unions, building and loan
association (B&LA), insurance companies, and
a small offshore sector. Both credit unions
and B&LA, with assets of about 13 percent of
GDP each, are relevant players in the
mortgage market, with the former also
providing consumer loans. Supervision of
these institutions, however, is spread across a
number of government agencies, with no
overarching framework. Also, the lack of an
appropriate legal framework to require
systematic reporting and enforce prudential
guidelines, combined with capacity
limitations, poses a serious challenge.
23.
The authorities agreed on the need
to strengthen supervision of the nonbanking sector and the importance of
setting up the Single Regulatory Unit
(SRU). Despite some write-offs of BAICO and
CLICO on their balance sheets, some large
credit unions and the B&LA still have
significant exposure. The authorities noted

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

that the B&LA was being monitored closely by
the Ministry of Finance, but the lack of proper
legislation is a serious handicap. The
legislation to establish the SRU, with the legal
mandate to supervise all non-bank financial
institutions and enforce prudential norms, is
expected to go to parliament in October 2011
and the SRU will be set up by year-end.
Insurance Sector
24.
Staff encouraged the authorities to
continue seeking a regional solution for
BAICO and CLICO, while minimizing fiscal
costs. The total exposure (in terms of
outstanding liabilities) amounts to about
EC$384.8 million or about 21 percent of GDP.
Provisioning for the non-performing BAICO
and CLICO assets on financial institutions’ and
NIS’s balance sheets has been ongoing, but
some institutions still carry significant unprovisioned liabilities on their balance sheets.
Staff urged the authorities to expedite
provisioning and enforce regulatory standards
at all institutions. Staff also urged, and the
authorities agreed, that the fiscal costs of the
resolution should be minimized through the
revision of existing terms, including lowering
interest rates, lengthening of the tenor, and
conversion of some liabilities into equity.

Offshore Financial Sector
25.
In line with the Fund technical
assistance mission, the International
Financial Services Authority (IFSA) has
intensified efforts to strengthen its
regulatory functions and supervisory
capacity. Twenty Tax Information Exchange
Agreements have been signed and there are
ongoing negotiations on three more. In
addition to strengthening its human resources

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

capacity through extensive training and
adopting a more efficient operating system,
IFSA conducted a full scope review of all
registered entities during the last quarter of
2010 and beginning of 2011. IFSA has worked
on improving compliance with the Financial
Action Task Forces 40+9 Recommendations
against money laundering and terrorist
financing.

D. Improving the Business Climate and Revitalizing Growth
26.
The slowdown in growth reflects
both cyclical and structural factors. On the
cyclical side, growth in St. Vincent and the
Grenadines is vulnerable to business cycles in
advanced countries, through tourism and FDI
flows. Structural factors, including the lack of
diversification in the economy, have
exacerbated the impact of cyclical factors.
Discussions with the private sector suggest
that access to credit, the high cost of electricity
and the lack of appropriate labor skills are key
factors holding back domestic private sector
development.
27.
The mission highlighted the need to
enhance growth potential, including
through improvements in the business
climate and the underlying infrastructure.
Policy recommendations included; (i) working
closely with CARICOM to establish credit
bureaus to ease access to credit, (ii) improving
the efficiency of customs (iii) enhancing the
ongoing efforts to expand hydroelectric
generation and explore options for wind farms
to reduce dependence on imported fuel and
hence reduce energy costs, and (iv) improving
the telecommunication network. In addition,
the mission encouraged the authorities to
facilitate private sector development by
(i) exploring the scope for increasing

collaboration between the Chamber of
Commerce, the Center for Enterprise
Development (CED) and the banks to provide
assistance to small and medium enterprises10,
and (ii) improving the quality and relevance of
technical training to address the mismatch
between available jobs and labor skills.
28.
The authorities pointed out that a
number of initiatives are under way to
enhance diversification and
competitiveness of the economy. These
include (i) the establishment of the North
Windward Vegetables Group; a partnership
with farmers that will facilitate the
transportation, packaging, grading and
marketing of agricultural products, and
(ii) establishment of the Agriculture Training
Institute and the Hospitality School with the
help of donors, to promote technical
education in agriculture and tourism,
(iii) expansion of the accreditation program to
provide skill certification and (iv) the two new
medical universities.
10

CED is a government’s institution that promotes
private sector activity and economic diversification,
including the facilitation of non-tourism services
investments and the promotion of small enterprise
development.

E. Future Fund Program
29.
The mission discussed the merits of
a possible medium-term Fund program,
including its role in catalyzing donor
support. The authorities agreed with staff on
the need for a medium-term policy framework
to address the underlying structural
vulnerabilities and the need for sustainable

financing to help increase the country’s
resilience to shocks. They reiterated their
commitment to continue implementing
policies agreed under the July RCF and the
current Article IV discussions and underscored
that donor financing already in the pipeline
would help to meet the expected financing
needs.

STAFF APPRAISAL
30.
St. Vincent and the Grenadines
continues to face significant challenges. The
recent exogenous shocks, including the global
slowdown and the two successive natural
disasters, have brought to the fore the
underlying structural vulnerability, including
the strong dependence of the economy on
advanced country flows and the vulnerabilities
to natural disasters. With limited tools and
little fiscal space, donor flows have been key to
help mitigate some of the impact from these
exogenous shocks. Growth is expected to
remain negative for a fourth year in a row ,
with a pick up next year largely reflecting
implementation of reconstruction projects, the
ongoing airport construction and the
establishment of two new universities.

32.
Staff welcomes the authorities’
commitment to medium-term fiscal
consolidation, including generating primary
surpluses in the range of 2 percent of GDP.
Over time, this will help to reduce debt service
and free up fiscal space for more productive
spending as well as build financial buffers and
strengthen the government’s ability to
respond to exogenous shocks. Toward this
end, staff encourages the authorities to
introduce the market based property tax,
further strengthen the LTU, gradually reduce
the wage bill to pre-crisis levels, limit transfers
to SOEs, and rationalize the various social
assistance programs. In this context, staff
welcomes the authorities’ commitment not to
borrow on commercial terms.

31.
Staff urges the authorities to
streamline current spending, while
protecting the poor and vulnerable groups.
While, in part, the increase in current spending
reflects government efforts to protect the poor
and vulnerable groups from the impact of the
adverse shocks, recent increases have come at
the cost of capital spending undermining the
economy’s long-term potential for growth.
Staff urged the authorities to streamline
current spending, and the risks of financing
non-discretionary spending from new
borrowing.

33.
Staff urges the authorities that a
stronger and more rapid fiscal adjustment
is necessary to build financial buffers to
address future exogenous shocks. In
addition to the reform efforts assumed in the
baseline, a more ambitious agenda for
structural fiscal reforms, including civil service
and pension reforms, would enhance the
government’s ability to address exogenous
shocks.

34.
Staff underscored the importance of
monitoring financial sector vulnerabilities.
While the domestic banking sector appears to
be resilient thus far, NPLs at credit unions and
most importantly the B&LA remain a
significant concern. In this context, staff would
encourage the authorities to continue to
monitor these institutions closely and expedite
the passage of the legislation and establish the
Single Regulatory Unit as soon as possible.

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

as indicated by staff’s assessment of the REER,
staff underscored the importance of further
structural reforms to improve the business
climate, including reducing the cost of doing
business, enhancing infrastructure and
improving competitiveness.
36.
It is expected that the next Article IV
Consultation with St. Vincent and the
Grenadines will take place on the standard
12-month cycle.

continued efforts to diversify the economy.

Box 1. Building Climate Resilience
1.
Major efforts are underway to build
climate resilience with the help of the World
Bank and other donors. The World Bank
approved a total of US$20.9 million
(EC$ 56.4 million) earlier this year, in a
combination of grants and IDA term loan, to
address disaster vulnerability and enhance
climate resilience. In particular, the project is
aimed at (i) rehabilitation of damaged and
vulnerable infrastructure, caused by the
passage of Hurricane Tomas, including, school
buildings and associated school infrastructure,
community centers, and strengthening a river
defense site; and (ii) strengthening the
government’s ability to evaluate natural hazard
and climate change risks. This is expected to
reduce economic losses due to weak urban
infrastructure of potential future natural
disasters.

2.
The mission emphasized the
importance of complementary efforts by the
government to ensure strict enforcement of
regulatory standards for buildings and other
infrastructure. Discussions in the context of
the July RCF request indicate that the extensive
damages from Hurricane Tomas and the recent
flooding to the housing stock and the
associated fiscal costs could have been limited
if the houses were built up to the standards of
the 2008 Building Code. Furthermore, most of
the houses damaged during the April 2011
landslides and floods were built near river
banks and river mouths as there are no zoning
laws currently outside Kingstown area. The
mission encouraged the authorities to design
zoning laws to avoid construction in disaster
vulnerable areas.

Box 2: Ensuring Long Term Solvency and Limiting the Fiscal Cost of the Pension System
1.
There are two government run pension
systems in St. Vincent and the Grenadines: the
National Insurance Service (NIS) and the Public
Service (PS). In addition, there are a number of
private pension systems. The private pension
systems are fully run and managed by private
enterprises and have no bearing for government
operations. On the other hand, the PS system is
fully paid and managed by the central
government and the NIS pension system is run by
a state-owned company. This box focuses on the
long term solvency and potential fiscal risks of the
latter two systems.
2.
The NIS is one of the most generous
pension systems in the region. The system has a
low contribution rate (8 percent, recently
increased from 6 percent), a young retirement age
(60 years), and a generous replacement rate
(60 percent) by international standards, and also
in comparison to other countries in the region. It
is a relatively new system (started operation in
1987) and for now the NIS has been running cash
flow surpluses and accumulated reserve levels
sufficient to pay out 10 years of current expenses,
in the absence of contributions, at end-2010.
However, the latest actuarial review shows that, in
the absence of parametric reforms, the
contributions collected will not be sufficient to
cover expenses after the year 2016, and
investment income will have to be used as a
supplement.1 The review also showed that
reserves are projected to start falling in 2027 and
will be depleted by 2040.
3.
Latest financial reports underscore the
need for reforms to ensure long-term viability.
Costs are increasing at a faster rate than
projected; the total cost of the scheme in percent
of insurable earnings has increased from
5.6 percent in 2007 to 7.3 percent in 2010, against
the projected level of 6.2 percent. Net income has

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

shrunk from EC$ 27.1 million in 2008 to
EC$5.7 million in 2010, reflecting the impact of
the economic downturn on investment incomes
and insurable earnings. The long-term viability of
the NIS could be seriously undermined in the
absence of parametric reforms.
4.
The PS pension benefits are received
by qualified public servants on top of their NIS
benefits.2 The PS pension system is a
non-contributory scheme with replacement rates
of up to 66⅔ percent; hence, allowing a
replacement rate of up to 127 percent in
combination with the NIS benefits. Fully funded
by the central government, PS retiring benefits
grew at 13.6 percent per annum during 2007–10
(9 percent in real terms) and consumed about
10 percent of total revenues as of 2010. Given the
aging population and hence rising number of
pensioners (number of PS pensioners increased
by 31 percent between 2006 and 2011), this trend
is likely to continue and pose significant risk to
fiscal sustainability.
5.
Pension reforms are necessary to
ensure the long-term solvency of the system
and reduce the fiscal burden. The NIS needs a
parametric reform, including gradual increases of
the contribution rate, the retirement age, and the
pension-qualifying minimum years of service. To
reduce the fiscal burden, the PS system should be
converted into a fully funded system with possible
mergers with the NIS system. In this regard, the
authorities are conducting an actuarial review to
assess options for reform, including the merger
between the NIS and PS pension systems.

Currently, 60 percent of PS employees are qualified as
pensionable workers for the PS pension system.

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Box 3. Exchange Rate Assessment
1.
Staff estimates suggest that the real
exchange rate is likely to be somewhat
overvalued. Three different methods are used,
two of which—the equilibrium real exchange
rate approach (ERER) and the macroeconomic
balance approach (MB)—follow standard Fundwide CGER methodology used by the IMF. The
third approach—the external sustainability
approach (ES)—is based on the debt stabilizing
current account. Depending on the
methodology used, the real exchange rate
appears to range from being in equilibrium to
being overvalued by about 15 percent. At the
ECCU level, the different CGER methodologies
do not provide an unambiguous result either,
but there are some signs that the exchange rate
is overvalued.
2.
The ERER approach suggests that the
real exchange rate is broadly in line with its
long-run equilibrium value. 1 The actual and
the equilibrium real exchange rate have both
been depreciating since 2010, reflecting the
slide of the U.S. dollar against other major
currencies. The competitor- and customerbased real effective exchange rates also show
that the country has benefited from the decline
in the U.S. dollar in the last year. However,
given the peg to the U.S. dollar and a largely
import-determined CPI, the ERER approach may
be less useful compared to the two other
approaches below in assessing exchange rate
valuations.
3.
The MB approach points to an
overvaluation of 8 percent . The standard
CGER methodology (using a sample of
114 countries including the ECCU) gives the
current account (CA) norm as -15.4 percent of
GDP. However, the underlying CA is -16.7
percent of GDP, implying that the real exchange
rate is overvalued by about 8 percent.

The estimation of the equilibrium exchange rate takes
into account productivity differentials in the tourism

2/ The sharp movements in the competitor-based real exchange rate in 2002–04 were largely
driven by the Dominican Republic’s peso.

4.
Finally, the external sustainability
approach (ES) points to an overvaluation of
14.8 or 28.5 percent, depending on whether
grants are included or not.2 The ES norm was
calculated using the debt stabilizing current
account from the Debt Sustainability Analysis
(DSA). If grants are included, there is a gap of
about 2½ percentage points of GDP between
the debt-stabilizing CA (-14.2) and the
underlying CA. In both cases, but with grants
included the overvaluation is much smaller. A
real depreciation is required to restore the
equilibrium in the medium term.

explanation of the methodology see: Pineda, Cashin
and Sun, 2009, “Assessing Exchange Rate
Competitiveness in the ECCU,” IMF Working Paper
09/78 (Washington: International Monetary Fund).
2

In countries where there is a large inflow of grants, (as
is the case for Saint Vincent and the Grenadines) that
are not debt-creating, the CA norm is higher and
consequently the implied overvaluation is lower.

October 13, 2011

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2011 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Approved By

Prepared by the Staff of the International Monetary Fund.

David Vegara and
Jan Kees Martijn

The current Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) indicates that, under the baseline scenario
discussed in the staff report, St. Vincent and the Grenadines’ risk of external debt distress
remains moderate. Despite rising in recent years, the public debt to GDP ratio is projected
to resume to a sustainable trajectory over the medium term in light of the authorities’
commitment to undertake fiscal consolidation measures and the projected rebound in
economic growth.

impacts resulted in a reversal of the 1.1 percent of
GDP primary surplus in 2008 to a deficit of
2.9 percent of GDP in 2010. At the same time, the
public sector debt-to-GDP ratio increased by
9.8 percentage points over the two year period to
66.8 percent in 2010. External debt constituted
around 62 percent of the public sector debt at
end-2010, of which about two-thirds is
multilateral debt. The Caribbean Development
Bank (CDB) is owed the bulk of the multilateral
debt.1 The central government owed about
83 percent of the total public sector debt at
end-2010, with the rest owed by state-owned
enterprises

2.

The fiscal stance for this year is

expected to be tighter than earlier projections,
reflecting financing shortfalls. Revenue
outturns and external disbursements for the first
7 months of the year fell short of expectations.
While marginal improvements in revenues are
expected, the outlook for external disbursement
remains gloomy for the rest of the year. As usual,
the brunt of financing shortfalls will fall on capital
expenditure, where less than half of the planned
projects are expected to be executed. The overall
deficit is expected to be lower by 1.4 percentage
points of GDP than earlier projections and the
central government debt for 2011 is projected at
56 percent of GDP, 2 percentage points lower

RCF discussions. Revenue is projected to
increase over the medium term, reflecting
the authorities’ plan to implement a
number of revenue enhancing measures
such as implementation of market-based
property tax, improvements in compliance
and enhancement of tax audits, and
streamlining exemptions. Central
government external grants, which peaked
in 2009, are projected to decline to around
2 percent of GDP over the medium term
and further fall to 1½ percent of GDP in
the long term. On the other hand,
expenditures in percent of GDP are
assumed to gradually fall to the pre-crisis
level, reflecting the planned expenditure
saving measures discussed in the staff
report.

The DSA analysis is based on the

following macroeconomic framework,
assuming that the authorities will implement
the policies discussed in the staff report.




Growth and Inflation: While expected to
decline by 0.4 percent this year, the
economy is projected to grow by 2 percent
in 2012, supported by a rebound in
agriculture and construction activities and
modest recovery in tourism and FDI flows.
Over the medium term, growth is
projected to reach its potential level of
3½ percent, reflecting improved
employment and consumption conditions
in tourism and FDI source countries.
End-period inflation is projected to reach
around 3.1 percent in 2011, reflecting the
uptick in international food and fuel prices.
Over the medium term, inflation is
projected to revert to its long-term path of
around 2½ percent, anchored by the
currency board arrangement.
Fiscal Balance: While the central
government’s primary balance is projected
to register a deficit of 0.3 percent of GDP
in 2011, over the medium-term it is
assumed that the primary balance will
register surpluses in the range of 2 percent
of GDP, in line with the authorities’
commitment in the context of the recent



External Sector: The current account
deficit is projected to narrow in 2011
primarily due to falls in imports and is
expected to continue narrowing to around
16.7 percent of GDP by 2016. Tourism and
FDI are assumed to rebound as economic
recovery strengthens in source countries
(mainly North America and Europe), over
the medium term. The grant element of
new external borrowing is projected to fall
over the medium to long term, reflecting

2

The fiscal balance numbers discussed in the
assumptions reflect only that of central government,
whereas the DSA includes both the central
government and state-owned enterprises. The primary
deficit for the consolidated public sector, that is,
including both the central government and the state
owned enterprises, is somewhat higher in the shortterm reflecting increased capital spending by the
electricity company and the International Airport
Development Corporation.

difficulty of accessing concessional

however, the grant element will continue
to remain high in the near to medium term

in line with the central government’s
commitment not to borrow on nonconcessional terms.

sustainability over the medium-term. The
public sector debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to
peak at 72 percent by 2013, the year when the
International Airport project is expected to be
completed. The debt trajectory is expected to start
a downward trend afterwards, reflecting fiscal
consolidation measures that the authorities plan
to take combined with the projected rebound in
economic growth, as discussed in the staff report.
The public debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to fall to
54 percent of GDP by 2020, below the ECCB’s
recommended threshold of 60 percent.
5.

Sensitivity analysis shows that higher

primary deficits are key vulnerabilities for
St. Vincent and the Grenadine’s debt
dynamics. Under a scenario where the primary
balance is unchanged at the 2011 level, the
Present Value (PV) of debt-to-GDP ratio would
reach 78 percent in 2021 and 85 percent in 2031,
compared to the base line levels of 49 percent
and 34 percent in 2021 and 2031, respectively
(Table 1b, Scenario A2). A scenario with

sector external debt is estimated at 41 percent of
GDP in 2011 and is projected to decline to
26 percent of GDP by 2021, well below the
threshold value of 50 percent4 (Table 2b). The
present values of debt and debt service to- export
and revenue ratios also remain below the
respective thresholds under the baseline scenario.
Nevertheless, some of these ratios including the
PV of debt-to-GDP ratio and the PV of debt-toexport ratio would briefly exceed the respective
prudential thresholds under the alternative
scenario of ‘most extreme shocks’ (Figure 1 and
Table 2b).

Sensitivity analysis shows that

dynamics is vulnerable to changes in the
nominal exchange rate. The stress test assuming
a one-time 30 percent nominal depreciation
relative to the baseline in 2012 indicates that the

The DSA uses policy-dependent external debt
burden indicators. Policy performance is measured by
the Country Policy and Institutional Assessment Index
(CPIA), compiled annually by the World Bank,
categorizing countries into three groups based on the
quality of their macroeconomic policies (strong,
medium, and poor). St. Vincent and the Grenadines is
classified as a strong performer, with the thresholds on
PV of debt-to-GDP, debt-to-exports, and debt-torevenue of 50, 200 and 300 percent, respectively.

borrowing, and revenues from land sales are
not available in 2012 and 2013, would increase
the risk of debt distress. To date, financing for
the airport project has largely come from external
grants and concessional loans from donors
(mainly from Cuba, Venezuela, Taiwan POC with
small amounts from a number of other donors)
and through land sales and privatization receipts.
Going forward, financing is expected to come
from the same sources. 5 In the event that these
funds are not available and the government
decides to finance the project through
commercial borrowing, the public sector debt-toGDP ratio would jump to 82 percent and the PV
of public sector external debt will jump to
47 percent, closer to the 50 percent threshold, in
2013. While the rating for the risk of external debt
distress remains moderate, the debt dynamics is
highly vulnerable to macroeconomic shocks. The

1/ Includes both public and publicly guaranteed external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange
rate changes. The relatively large residual reflects the significant role of capital grants in financing the current account.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

Grenadines maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on the making of payments and
transfer for current international transactions.

VIII.

Safeguards Assessment: Under the Fund's safeguards assessment policy, the Eastern
Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB), of which St. Vincent and the Grenadines is a member, is subject
to a full safeguards assessment under a four year cycle. The most recent assessment was
completed in July 2007, and concluded that the ECCB continues to have appropriate control
mechanisms in place, which have strengthened since the first safeguards assessment completed
in 2003. ECCB management places emphasis on good governance and sound controls, and has
enhanced the bank's transparency and accountability since the last assessment, including the
publications of financial statements that comply with International Financial Reporting
Standards. The assessment made some recommendations to sustain the ECCB's safeguards
framework going forward.

IX.

Article IV consultation: The last Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive Board
on July 26, 2010; the relevant document is Country Report No. 10/184. St. Vincent and the
Grenadines is on a 12-month cycle.

X.

Technical assistance (January 2006– ): Several missions from the Caribbean Regional
Technical Assistance Centre (CARTAC), the Fiscal Affairs Department (FAD), and the Legal
Department (LEG) have visited St. Vincent and the Grenadines since the beginning of 2006 to
assist the authorities.
In the area of public finance, CARTAC/LEG assisted with the introduction of the VAT and excise
taxes at all different stages. CARTAC also assisted to monitor the central government’s fiscal
performance relative to its annual targets presented in the budget. CARTAC has provided
technical assistance in statistics to develop export-import prices, national accounts, and
balance of payments statistics. CARTAC has also provided technical assistance in the areas of
collection, enforcement, and projections of public finance and GDP. On the financial front
CARTAC provided technical assistance to review and upgrade the International Insurance Act,
and to develop regulations for Credit Unions. CARTAC also provided technical assistance in
conducting off-site and on-site examinations on banks in international financial services
industry. FAD provided technical assistance in improving tax administration, including reform
and modernization of both inland revenue and customs and excise tax. FAD also provided
advice on selected tax policy issues and expenditure rationalization.

ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES

APPENDIX II. ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES:
RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
(September 6, 2011)
The World Bank Group’s Management
presented to its Board the Organization of the
Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) Regional
Partnership Strategy (RPS) on June 8, 2010.
The RPS covers the five year period
July 2009-June 2014. It sets forth the terms of
engagement of the International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), the
International Development Association (IDA)
and the International Finance Corporation (IFC)
with the countries of the Eastern Caribbean,
sub-regional organizations and other
development partners in pursuit of the
following strategic objectives: (a) building
resilience; and (b) enhancing competitiveness
and stimulating growth over the medium term.
To help build resilience, the Bank Group will
support interventions aimed at promoting
fiscal and debt sustainability, protecting and
improving human capital—particularly social
safety nets, education and health—and

strengthening climate resilience. To help
enhance competitiveness and stimulate
sustainable growth, it will focus its support on
two critical areas: strengthening the countries’
domestic financial sectors and improving
access to quality services to create more
competitive business environments. The
Strategy will provide urgent remedial
measures to address the crippling effects of
the global and regional crises, while
supporting key policy reforms that establish a
platform for growth in the medium term.
The planned program of support will entail
new commitments totaling up to about $120
million on IBRD terms and up to $73 million of
IDA financing for the six Bank Members of the

OECS, including St. Vincent and the
Grenadines. St. Vincent and the Grenadines is
eligible to borrow from IDA and IBRD during
the period of the RPS.

A. Projects
There are five active World Bank projects in
St. Vincent and the Grenadines for a net
commitment of approximately US$27.9 million.
The OECS Disaster Vulnerability Reduction
Project, which was recently approved for
US$13.92 million, is not yet effective.
The OECS E-Government for Regional
Integration Program was approved by the
Board in May 2008. The loan to St. Vincent and
the Grenadines was approved in December
2009 and consists of a US$2.3 million IDA
Credit designed to promote the efficiency,

4

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

quality, and transparency of public services
through the delivery of regionally integrated
e-government applications that take
advantage of economies of scale. The
program is structured in phases. Phase 1
focuses on cross-sectoral e-government issues,
as well as on specific applications in the public
finance area (including Public Financial
Management or PFM, tax, customs and
procurement), and also includes an egovernment in health pilot project (possibly
together with preparatory and complementary
activities in other social and productive

ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES

sectors). Subsequent phases of the program
are expected to deepen the assistance
provided under Phase 1, while expanding the
program to cover other sectors, in particular,
education, agriculture, tourism, postal, among
others, that may emerge during the early
stages of implementation of Phase 1.
The Telecommunications & ICT
Development Project, approved in May 2005
for US$0.5 million, aims at improving the
access, quality, and use of telecommunications
and ICT services to achieve socio-economic
development in the OECS. The project has four
components. Component 1 will strengthen the
national and regional regulatory frameworks
and promote additional competition in the
telecommunications sector. Emphasis will be
given on providing capacity building to the
Eastern Caribbean Telecommunications
Authority (ECTEL) and the National
Telecommunications Regulatory Commissions
(NTRCs) by assisting them in revising the
regional and national sector legislation, and in
developing a modern interconnection regime.
Component 2 will review current universal
access policy, create related guidelines, and
provide financial support to establish a
Universal Service Fund (USF). Component 3 will
improve growth and competitiveness in
ICT-enabled services through utilization of
broadband infrastructure. Component 4 will
finance the management and administration of
the overall project. The project will finance
related technical assistance by providing
complementary resources.
The St. Vincent and the Grenadines
Education Development Project was
approved in June 2004 for US$6.2 million. The
overall objective of this project is to build
human capital which, in turn, will contribute to
the diversification of the economy and more
sustainable growth. This objective will be
achieved by: (a) increasing equitable access to
secondary education; (b) improving the quality

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

of the teaching and learning process, with
more direct interventions at the school level
and a focus on student-centered learning; and
(c) strengthening sector management and
governance of schools.
The Hurricane Tomas Emergency Recovery
Credit was approved in January 2011 for
US$5 million and aims at rehabilitating
damaged infrastructure caused by the passage
of Hurricane Tomas and strengthening the
Government’s ability to analyze locationspecific risks. The project has three
components. Component 1 will rehabilitate
and reconstruct vulnerable and damaged
infrastructure. Component 2 will improve the
capacity of the Ministry of Housing, Informal
Human Settlements, Lands and Surveys and
Physical Planning (MoHILP) and the National
Emergency Management Organization (NEMO)
to evaluate natural hazard and climate change
risks by training their staff and providing
technical advisory services and acquisition of
goods. Component 3 will strengthen and
develop the institutional capacity of the Public
Sector Investment Program Management Unit
(PSIPMU) for project management and
execution, including procurement, financial
management and supervision of project
activities, through the acquisition of goods,
provision of technical advisory services,
training, and operating costs.
The OECS Disaster Vulnerability Reduction
Project was approved in June 2011. St. Vincent
and the Grenadines will receive a total of
US$20.92 million, including a US$10.92 million
zero-interest credit from IDA repayable in
35 years with a 10-year grace period; a
US$7 million grant from the Pilot Program for
Climate Resilience (PPCR); and a US$3 million
zero-interest loan from the PPCR repayable in
40 years with a 10-year grace period. The
project aims to create understanding of the
vulnerability of key structures and increase
resilience of critical public infrastructure, which
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

5

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES

will complement the work and goals of the
PPCR. Component 1 will implement a broad
spectrum of interventions aimed at building
resilience in public buildings and
infrastructure. Component 2 will support
regional efforts in the Eastern Caribbean to
build capacity to conduct assessment of
natural risks and integrate such knowledge
into policy- and decision-making for
development investments, disaster risk
mitigation, climate change adaptation, and
disaster response planning across sectors.

Component 3 will re-categorize financing or
provide additional financing to cover early
recovery and rehabilitation costs following an
adverse natural event, and subject to a
Government’s declaration of emergency in
accordance with national law and the
submission of a recovery action plan
satisfactory to the Association. Component 4
will strengthen and develop the institutional
capacity for project management and
implementation.

B. Economic and Sector Work
The Bank has completed a series of analytical
products relating to public expenditure, fiscal
and debt sustainability, growth and
competitiveness, the financial sector, public
sector management and social protection. The
ongoing dissemination of these reports
represents a key instrument for policy dialogue
with the OECS governments, including
St. Vincent and the Grenadines.
The Bank’s program in St. Vincent and the
Grenadines is further supported by a
comprehensive series of completed, ongoing
and planned analytical and advisory activities,
including the following: “Towards a New
Agenda for Growth” – OECS growth and

ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES

APPENDIX III. ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES:
RELATIONS WITH THE CARIBBEAN DEVELOPMENT
BANK (CDB)
(As of August, 2011)
A small open economy, St. Vincent and the
Grenadines is particularly vulnerable to
economic shocks and natural hazards. Since
2008, a series of such adverse exogenous
shocks have caused major economic losses,
weakening the country’s macroeconomic
position. Even as the direct impact of the
global slowdown has lessened, weatherinduced shocks associated with
Hurricane Tomas, a severe drought and
torrential rainfall and flooding in 2010 and
2011 have added to macroeconomic
weaknesses.
In the aftermath of these recent disasters,
CDB’s assistance to the Government of Saint
Vincent and the Grenadines has focused on
providing grant and loan funding to assist with
emergency relief and economic rehabilitation
and recovery efforts. The Bank will be
providing a loan of US$12.62 million
(approved in July 2011) to rehabilitate and
reconstruct critical infrastructure, and upgrade
and improve affected emergency shelters to
internationally accepted standards. The project
also provides for technical assistance to the
Government of St. Vincent and the Grenadines
to undertake a hydraulic assessment study of
major watersheds in the central and north
windward region of the island, for developing
standard operating procedures for disaster
responses for the Ministry of Transport and
Works, and for undertaking a coastal study as
well as medium

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

to long-term sea defense designs for capital
works at Sandy Bay and Dark View. A
substantial part of this financing is being
provided on concessionary terms through the
Bank’s Special Development Fund.
At August 2011, cumulative loans approved by
CDB to the Government and Statutory
Authorities stood at US$245.3 million, of which
US$218.9 million was disbursed, while total
loans outstanding amounted to
US$144.9 million. Of the total loans approved,
US$62 million was borrowed during 2009 and
2010 under the framework for policy-based
lending to help mitigate the effects of the
global crisis on public finances, and to support
a range of macroeconomic and financial sector
reforms. Those loans have been fully
disbursed.
For the year to August 2011, the disbursement
of CDB financing fell-off significantly as flows
normalized following the accelerated rate of
disbursement in prior years. At the same time,
however, CDB project operations were
adversely affected by the Government’s
constrained fiscal position which impinged on
the Government’s ability to adequately provide
counterpart financing. Given the lower
disbursements, there was a negative net
transfer of resources (that is, disbursements of
loans less repayments of principal, interest and
charges) between CDB and St Vincent and the
Grenadines.

ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES

APPENDIX IV. ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES:
STATISTICAL ISSUES
I.

Assessment of Data Adequacy for
Surveillance

General: Data provision has some
shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for
surveillance. Statistical databases remain weak
in terms of coverage, consistency, periodicity,
and timeliness. While in areas central to
surveillance—notably central government
accounts, indicators of the financial sector and
external sector accounts—the data are
adequate for surveillance purposes,
information on the rest of the public sector
and nonbank financial intermediaries is limited.
Major improvements are needed to facilitate
effective surveillance, particularly in the
coverage of national accounts (especially the
tourism sector and related services), and on
data used to monitor labor markets. Efforts to
address the weaknesses in the statistical base
have been hampered by low response rates to
surveys (less than 50 percent) and high
turnover of staff.
National Accounts: A new rebased GDP series
(using 2006 as the base year instead of 1990)
was released in January 2011 with assistance
from CARTAC. The new series improved
coverage, data sources, and methodology. The
revision disaggregated some industries
previously classified under government into
separate sectors that now include private
sector activity; these are health, education, and
social development. The new series also
improved the level of detail by estimating
value added for business services, computer
and related services, and private households
with employed persons which were not
accounted for in the previous series. However,
some weakness remain; data on GDP broken

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

down by expenditure is not available at
constant prices, while data at current prices is
not reliable due to weaknesses in estimating
gross capital formation. Private final
consumption expenditure is estimated as a
residual. In October 2007 CARTAC also
launched a project for strengthening tourism
statistics in the OECS, including St. Vincent and
the Grenadines. The project covers the core
tourism datasets relating to visitor arrivals,
visitor expenditure, tourist accommodation
and statistics for other key tourism-related
enterprises. The project will also seek to
standardize and harmonize tourism concepts,
definitions and classification schemes across
these countries.
Price statistics: A new CPI index series (with
January 2010 as the base) was introduced in
June 2011 with assistance from CARTAC. The
new index introduced updated methods and
procedures used for compiling the CPI that are
in accordance with international standards and
allows comparisons among the ECCU member
states. The new index uses a Household
Budget and Expenditure Survey (HBES) that
took place in 2008, replacing the old HBES
conducted in 1996, to construct an updated
CPI basket. As part of the CARTAC’s assistance
with the new CPI index it helped link the 2001
based to the 2010-based CPI series.
Government finance statistics: Due to delays
in reporting capital expenditures by some
ministries, monthly revenue and expenditure
data for the central government are provided
to the Fund with some lag. Discrepancies exist
between the fiscal and monetary accounts,
between above and below the line for budget

ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES

data, and between financing and debt data.
The financial reports of public enterprises are
not timely, with about a two-year lag.
Monetary statistics: Monetary statistics are
compiled and reported to the Fund by the
ECCB on a monthly basis based on a
standardized report form since July 2006. The
institutional coverage of monetary statistics
needs to be improved by including the
accounts of mortgage companies, building
societies, credit unions, and insurance
companies. In this respect, close coordination
between the ECCB and the single regulatory
unit (which will supervise financial institutions
other than those licensed under the Banking
Act) will be crucial.
While noting some recent improvements, the
2007 data ROSC mission identified the
following main shortcomings in the ECCB’s
monetary statistics: (i) the methodological
soundness of monetary statistics can be
improved by adopting internationally accepted
concepts and definitions, expanding
institutional coverage, and revising the
classifications of financial instruments and the
basis for recording; (ii) transparency can be
improved, for example, by releasing monetary
data to all users at the same time and
strengthening the validation of the
disseminated data; (iii) the timeliness of the
dissemination of data on broad money and
credit aggregates can be improved to meet
best international practices; and (iv) the access
to officially disseminated data and metadata
can be improved.
Balance of payments: Balance of payments
data are compiled by the ECCB on an annual
basis. Data reported to STA are becoming
more timely, although quality, frequency and
coverage need to be improved. Quarterly

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

estimates and the international investment
position statement are not compiled. The
estimates lack sufficient detail due to the
unavailability of source data, and the statistical
techniques used to estimates some
components are weak. In particular, no
estimates are available on transportation
services by type or mode of transport and of
travel by purpose. Further, a breakdown of
portfolio and other investment by instrument
or sector is not available. There is a need to
compile quarterly balance of payments
estimates and the annual international
investment position statement; however,
developing these new statistics will have to be
undertaken in conjunction with the ECCB,
which coordinates the compilation of the
external sector statistics for all its member
countries.
External debt: The Ministry of Finance
maintains a database on public and publiclyguaranteed external loans that provides
detailed and current information on
disbursements, debt service, and debt stocks.
The Treasury maintains the data on bonds
placed abroad. Data from the two databases as
well as information on payments by creditor
(actual and scheduled) need to be further
consolidated to produce timely debt stock
data.
II.
Data Standards and Quality
St. Vincent and the Grenadines participates in
the General Data Dissemination System since
September 2000. The 2007 regional data ROSC
on monetary statistics provides an assessment
of the ECCB’s monetary statistics. No data
ROSC is available for other sectors.

IMF Executive Board Concludes Article IV Consultation with
St. Vincent and the Grenadines
On November 16, 2011, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with St. Vincent and the Grenadines.1
Background
Growth in St. Vincent and the Grenadines continues to be affected by the global
slowdown through its impact on tourism and FDI. In addition, the two recent natural
disasters—hurricane Tomas in October 2010 and torrential rains and floods in
April 2011—have also taken a toll. After a contraction of 1.8 percent in 2010, growth in
2011 is expected to remain negative, albeit to -0.4 percent, moderated by reconstruction
activity after Hurricane Tomas. Along with other donors, the Fund has provided
significant emergency assistance to St. Vincent and the Grenadines to address the
immediate balance of payments need arising from the impact of the global financial
crisis and the two recent natural disasters.2

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board.
2

The Fund provided US$5.6 million (45 percent of quota) in May 2009 under the Exogenous
Shocks Facility to help mitigate the impact of the global financial crisis, US$3.26 million
(25 percent of quota) under the Rapid Credit Facility (RCF) to deal with the impacts of
Hurricane Tomas, and US$2.0 million (15 percent of quota) under the RCF to deal with the
impact of the April 2011 torrential rains and floods.

2
Inflation has picked up reflecting higher international commodity prices. The
pass-through from higher food and fuel prices (with a combined weight of 34 percent in
the CPI) resulted in headline inflation accelerating to about 2.8 percent (y/y) by June this
year compared to about ½ percent at the end of last year. Meanwhile, core inflation
remained unchanged at 0.6 percent compared to December last year.
The fiscal deficit is expected to be smaller than last year, mainly reflecting cuts in capital
spending to offset shortfalls in revenues and delayed disbursement of external loans.
Current expenditure has been rising, in part, to mitigate the impact of the adverse
shocks on the poor and vulnerable. Over the medium-term, the authorities remain
committed to generating a primary surplus averaging about 2 percent of GDP. A more
ambitious fiscal consolidation path would allow for a faster reduction in debt and room to
build a cushion against future exogenous shocks.
Monetary aggregates remain flat, with the year-on-year growth in real private sector
credit and broad money supply nearly flat as of June 2011, reflecting banks wariness to
make new loans in an uncertain environment. With regard to the financial sector,
non-performing loans at commercial banks in the country decreased somewhat from
8½ percent at end-December 2010 to 7½ percent at end-June 2011, but bank
profitability has also been declining. NPLs remain elevated in the non-banking financial
sector, although efforts are ongoing to improve performance. In order to improve
supervision in the non-bank sector, the government is planning to establish the Single
Regulatory Unit by year-end.
Efforts continue to help resolve the fallout from the failure of the two insurance
companies, BAICO and CLICO. A Health Insurance Fund was set up to settle medical
claims of BAICO’s policyholders. An announcement was recently made inviting
interested parties to bid for BAICO’s life insurance policy portfolio and discussions are
also ongoing to find a solution for BAICO’s annuity holders. On CLICO, the authorities
continue to work with other governments in the region to find a solution.
Executive Board Assessment
The Executive Directors noted that St. Vincent and the Grenadines’ economy has been
adversely affected by two natural disasters in the last twelve months, on top of the
impacts of the global slowdown and higher commodity prices. As a result, real GDP has
contracted and public sector debt has risen. Directors welcomed the authorities’
commitment to prudent macroeconomic policies and encouraged them to press ahead
with efforts to enhance the economy’s resilience to shocks and foster sustainable
growth.
Directors commended the authorities’ intention to generate primary fiscal surpluses in
the range of 2 percent of GDP by 2016 and to avoid external commercial borrowing to
ensure debt sustainability. They welcomed their plans to introduce market based

3
property taxes, strengthen revenue administration, contain the public sector wage bill,
limit transfers to state owned enterprises, and rationalize spending on goods and
services. While the difficult trade-offs with current pro-growth and social spending needs
were recognized, many Directors noted that a more ambitious consolidation, including
pension and civil service reforms, would help to build buffers against potential future
shocks.
Directors underscored the need for close monitoring of both the banking and nonbank
financial sectors. They noted that regional financial sector concerns could affect
confidence and ultimately impact economic activity. Directors supported enhanced
monitoring of cross-institution and cross-border holdings, in coordination with regional
authorities. They also encouraged the authorities to expedite the establishment of the
Single Regulatory Unit for the nonbank sector.
Directors highlighted the need to increase the growth potential and diversify the
economy, including by improving the business climate and enhancing competitiveness.
This would help to reduce the large and unsustainable current account deficit. Directors
welcomed the authorities’ efforts to ease access to credit and invest in infrastructure and
education. They noted that technical assistance and donor support would be important
to underpin the country’s reform agenda.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.
