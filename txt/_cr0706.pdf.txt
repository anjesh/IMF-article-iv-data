EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
•

Program implementation during 2005 and 2006 was mixed. Five of seven quantitative
performance criteria were met, but there were significant delays in implementing
structural reforms, resulting in several benchmarks not being observed. The
authorities are requesting waivers for the nonobservance of missed performance
criteria.

•

Macrobudgetary performance remains broadly satisfactory with the narrowly defined
primary deficit (excluding grants) contained to a low level. However, economic
activity has steadily decelerated in recent years owing to limited progress in
addressing core economic vulnerabilities. Real GDP growth is expected to rebound to
4.5 percent in 2006 from 2.9 percent the previous year, mostly underpinned by
developments in the cotton and trade sectors. Nonetheless, growth would fall short of
the 6-7 percent range consistent with meeting the Millennium Development Goals
(MDs).

•

The new government has stated its determination to address Benin’s economic
challenges with Fund support. The authorities aim to preserve macroeconomic
stability, foster economic diversification and good governance, and accelerate
structural reforms, including measures to strengthen the judicial and land tenure
systems.

•

The macroeconomic objectives for 2007 include real GDP growth of 5.5 percent and
twelve-month inflation remaining around 2.5 percent. A low narrowly defined
primary fiscal deficit points to a broadly sustainable fiscal position in 2007.

•

To reinvigorate stalled structural reforms, the authorities have approved strategies for
state disengagement from the cotton, electricity and telecommunications sectors,
including timetables for implementing related reform measures. Under these, the
government is to withdraw from the cotton parastatal by mid-2007, and bring to point
of sale the electricity and telecommunications companies by end-August 2007 and
end-January 2009, respectively. Structural reforms are essential to stem the erosion of
external competitiveness in the face of continuing appreciation of the real effective
exchange rate. In fostering development of a supportive financial system, it will be
important that most banks continue to meet key prudential norms.

•

Creating fiscal space for more pro-growth public investment and pro-poor spending
will require continuation of ongoing efforts to broaden the tax base. Limiting
spending on wages will also be key to enabling spending priorities to be met. In the
post-MDRI era, ambitious plans for major infrastructure spending would need to be
subject to careful cost-benefit analysis and financed on concessional terms to preserve
external debt sustainability.

•

Staff recommends the completion of the first review under the PRGF arrangement.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
In recent years, Benin has experienced a steady deceleration of real GDP growth
owing to limited progress in addressing core economic vulnerabilities and delays in
implementing crucial growth-supporting structural reforms. The weakening of growth
has taken place against a backdrop of an appreciating real effective exchange rate and, more
recently, a large deterioration in the terms of trade. In the structural area, privatization of the
public utility and cotton companies is still pending. Only in the transport sector have steps
been taken to begin improving the competitiveness of the Port of Cotonou (Box 1).
2.
Against this background, Benin’s macroeconomic situation remains fragile.
Dependent on cotton and reexport trade with Nigeria, the economy remains vulnerable to
exogenous shocks. Wage pressures, the pension fund’s rising deficit, and the government’s
debt to civil servants could further strain macroeconomic stability. Public administration
reform is overdue.
3.
The new government has stated its determination to address Benin’s economic
vulnerabilities with Fund support. Proposed reforms focus on fostering an environment
conducive to private sector-led growth and poverty reduction, with emphasis on strong
revenue collection, prudent spending and wage policies in the post HIPC/MDRI-era, and
resolute implementation of structural reforms. Initiatives in these areas constitute pivotal
components of the economic program for 2006 and 2007.
4.
Conclusion of the first PRGF review has been delayed due to lack of progress on
cotton and public utility sectors reform in the run-up to the recent presidential election. All
quantitative performance criteria for end-September 2005, the test date for the first review,
and most benchmarks for end-September and end-December 2005 were met (MEFP, Tables
1 and 2).

Box 1. Benin: Key 2004 Article IV Recommendations
Advice
Implement structural reforms to reverse the
decline in external competitiveness and lower
vulnerability to external shocks

Status
The divestiture program for public utilities and the cotton
sector has been considerably delayed. The new
government has, however, committed to completing the
bulk of needed reforms by year-end 2007. Steps are also
being taken to accelerate reform of the judiciary and land
tenure, notably with US Millennium Challenge Account
(MCA) assistance. An Investors Council is being set up.

•

Introduce revenue and expenditure measures to
limit the deterioration of the fiscal position

Fiscal consolidation efforts have continued, and
appropriate spending cuts are routinely made to offset
revenue shortfalls. Enhancing revenue mobilization
remains a key medium-term objective.

•

Strengthen the institutions in charge of seed
cotton and input commercialization

The government recently introduced legislation
rationalizing the National Councils of (i) Cotton
Producers; (ii) Cotton Fertilizer Importers and
Distributors; and (iii) Cotton Ginners.

•

Pursue discussions with Nigeria to resolve
outstanding trade issues

•

Improve customs and tax administration

•

Complete the first annual progress report (APR)
on the implementation of the PRSP; integrate the
PRSP into a sound multiyear macroeconomic
framework

•

Trade restrictions with Nigeria are declining. President
Boni Yayi recently signed agreements with his Nigerian
counterpart that aim to further reduce obstacles to trade
between the two countries.
A one-stop shop for customs and other port transactions
has been set up; ad hoc customs exemptions have been
reduced; the large- and medium-sized taxpayer units of the
Tax Department are being strengthened; and fiscal control
programs have improved to enhance tax revenue
mobilization.
The first APR was completed and circulated to the IMF
Board in 2005. A second APR for the PRSP has been
issued; a third APR is about to be finalized. The 2002
PRSP is being updated, consistent with Benin’s mediumterm macroeconomic framework.

II. ECONOMIC AND PROGRAM DEVELOPMENTS
5.
Economic performance has been subdued in recent years, but a turnaround in
the cotton sector has helped revive growth. The cotton sector contributes an estimated
10 percent to total value added; it employs about 350,000 workers and touches an estimated
40 percent of Benin’s population. With cotton production declining sharply because of
delayed disbursement of 2004-05 season payments to cotton farmers and fertilizer
distributors, and uncertainties regarding the privatization program, real GDP growth
decelerated to 2.9 percent in 2005 (compared with 4 percent under the program). Weak
investment demand owing to election-related uncertainties, continued currency appreciation,
and a large terms of trade decline also depressed economic activity (Figure 1 and Text

7
table 1).1 The impact on growth was softened by a vigorous pick up in commerce as trade
relations between neighboring Nigeria and Benin improved following tensions in 2004. As
cotton production recovers, following settlement in April 2006 of debts to farmers and
fertilizer distributors, and the trade and transportation sectors benefit from Port of Cotonou
reforms and ongoing improvements in trade relations with Nigeria, growth is likely to
rebound to 4.5 percent in 2006. Inflation is projected to ease to 2½ percent by end-2006,
following a spike in prices in 2005 owing to strong food demand from crisis-afflicted Niger
and high oil prices.

The terms of trade have been highly volatile in recent years mainly because of swings in world cotton and oil
prices. Their impact on the economy has been smoothed by the operation of various cotton producer subsidies
and by lower-priced informal sector oil imports from Nigeria.

External competitiveness has steadily eroded since the 1994 devaluation of the
CFA franc. The real effective exchange rate appreciated by another 2 percent in 2005, owing
to unfavorable price developments.2 By year-end 2005, Benin had lost over 60 percent of the
competitiveness it had gained from the 1994 devaluation—with the real effective
appreciation higher than in most other WAEMU countries (Figure 2). Moreover, as world oil
prices surged and the f.o.b. price for ginned cotton declined 35 percent, the terms of trade
deteriorated by about 16 percent in 2005. Nonetheless, the current account deficit, excluding
grants, continued to moderate, reflecting lower formal sector oil imports stemming from
management weaknesses at SONACOP (Benin’s oil-importing monopoly) and weaker
capital goods imports. Benin’s share of the BCEAO’s foreign exchange reserves is
equivalent to over 10 months of imports, in part owing to comfortable donor support.

Box 2. Benin: Coping With Structural Bottlenecks and Higher
Prices in the Domestic Petroleum Distribution Sector
Beset by severe governance problems since its privatization in 1999, SONACOP—in which
the state maintains a 35 percent share—had been unable to secure a steady supply of
petroleum products in Benin, causing a resurgence in informal sector oil imports. By the end
of March 2006, such informal imports covered an estimated 75 percent of domestic demand.
In March 2006, the outgoing administration requisitioned for three months all of
SONACOP’s assets, including storage facilities and gasoline stations, and named a new
management team. The government established in April 2006 renewed the previous
administration’s requisition and took steps to improve the company’s management, restoring
the availability of petroleum products on the formal market at no cost to the budget. The
authorities intend nevertheless to return SONACOP management to the private sector. In the
meantime, in May 2006 the authorities, faced with escalating world oil prices, froze
domestic retail prices by (i) suspending the automatic price-setting mechanism for oil
products, and (ii) lowering the rate of the specific tax on petroleum products. As result,
revenue from the VAT and special tax on petroleum products declined to CFAF 0.3 billion
in May-July 2006, compared with CFAF 3.9 billion in the same period of 2005.
For the medium term, the authorities aim to raise the formal sector’s market share while
mitigating the social impact of world oil price increases. This strategy would improve
petroleum tax revenue collection and reduce the safety risks associated with informal sector
oil distribution activities. Envisaged policy actions include (i) early return of SONACOP to
private sector ownership; (ii) granting investment-promoting fiscal incentives to domestic
oil distributors; (iii) reestablishing the suspended flexible-pricing mechanism, (iv)
enhancing customs controls of petroleum imports from neighboring Nigeria; and (v)
instituting fiscal measures to protect vulnerable social groups from large oil price increases.
The authorities intend to seek development partners’ assistance in elaborating these
measures in a medium-term reform strategy for the oil sector, including an expeditious
implementation timetable.

7.
Benin’s fiscal situation weakened in 2005 and in early 2006. In 2005, the narrowly
defined primary budget deficit widened to 1.4 percent of GDP, ½ percent of GDP above the
program target. Revenue stagnated at 16½ percent of GDP, as weaknesses in revenue
administration, especially at the General Directorate of Taxes, were left unaddressed. The
government’s cash flow came under severe pressure when the outgoing administration settled
unprogrammed domestic arrears to suppliers (from 2004) equivalent to 1 percent of GDP. In
early 2006, the underlying cash-flow situation deteriorated owing to the payment of bills held
from FY 2005, wage arrears, and various restructuring expenditures. New domestic arrears
equivalent to 1.5 percent of GDP were accumulated.

Expenditure and revenue measures introduced in the second quarter of 2006
have improved the budgetary situation and strengthened Benin’s short-term fiscal
prospects. Fiscal measures included (i) the institution of a treasury committee to monitor
more closely revenue collection and spending execution under the supervision of the finance
minister, (ii) strict adherence to expenditure execution procedures, and (iii) renewed
commitment not to undertake extrabudgetary expenditures. With technical assistance from
the World Bank, the new administration has also initiated an audit of the new domestic
payments arrears that came to light in 2006. The audit report and a plan to settle certified
arrears are to be completed by end-2006. In the second quarter of 2006, with revenue about
5 percent above target and expenditure substantially below target, the narrowly defined
primary budget balance recorded a surplus (1.0 percent of GDP), compared with a targeted
deficit of 0.2 percent of GDP. Net bank credit to the government declined by an estimated

12

CFAF 30 billion, compared with the CFAF 5 billion anticipated under the program. For 2006
as a whole, the narrowly defined primary budget deficit is projected to decline to the initial
program target of 0.4 percent of GDP (0.9 percent, including MDRI-funded outlays).
9.
Money and credit conditions are relatively easy. Broad money rose by over
22 percent in 2005, considerably more than nominal GDP (Figure 4 and Table 4). In response
to rising inflation, a 20-percent expansion of credit to the private sector, and perceived capital

increased the reserve requirement ratio
by 400 basis points, to 15 percent, in
mid-2005, the highest level in the West
African Economic and Monetary Union
(WAEMU). Broad money and private
sector credit growth has eased and is
projected to slow to a pace closer to

Performance under the
program has been mixed. Two of the
seven quantitative and structural
performance criteria, as well as two
quantitative indicative targets and six
structural benchmarks, were not
observed. The missed performance
criteria were related to the outgoing
administration’s guarantee of a
nonconcessional loan to the state-owned
telecommunications company (Benin Telecoms) and the accumulation of domestic payments
arrears.3 More generally, progress in implementing the structural reform agenda has been
slow. Privatization of the cotton, telephone, and electricity parastatals is still pending, and a
comprehensive program to expand activities at the Port of Cotonou, including private sector
involvement in management, has yet to be completed. Nevertheless, the installation of key
components of the software for the port’s centralized clearing and invoicing management
center was completed in November 2005, albeit with a two-week delay. This permitted the
start in March 2006 of initial operations at the facility’s one-stop shop for customs and other
administrative transactions (a delayed December 2005 performance criterion). Efforts to
expand the scope of these operations are needed and are under way.

The loan from a Chinese bank was in the amount of US$31 million, at an interest rate of LIBOR+1 and
maturity of six years (including a one-year grace period). It has a grant element of 9 percent, compared with the
minimum 35 percent specified under the program.

III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
11.
The government’s ambition is to make Benin’s economy more resilient to
external shocks, reinvigorate growth and facilitate progress toward the Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs). The authorities are developing a five-pillar growth strategy
that underscores (i) preservation of macroeconomic stability; (ii) promotion of growthsupporting sectors to facilitate economic diversification; (iii) enhanced efficiency of public
administration (including through more rigorous monitoring of governance practices);
(iv) deepening and acceleration of structural reforms; and (v) public participation in policymaking. These priorities are consistent with the country’s core commitments under the PRGF
arrangement. In particular, the authorities concur that, in view of the fixed exchange rate
regime, envisaged growth objectives require accelerated structural reforms and continued
fiscal consolidation to preserve macroeconomic stability. Consistent with this understanding,
discussions focused on the medium-term macroeconomic framework, especially fiscal policy
options, as well as on structural reform priorities. The mission also reviewed recent and
prospective performance under the PRGF-supported program.
A. Medium-Term Macroeconomic Framework: Realizing Higher Growth
12.
A comprehensive strategy that raises both capital accumulation and total factor
productivity (TFP) growth is needed to boost economic growth to rates consistent with
achieving the MDGs. Econometric analysis of growth performance in 1965–20054 suggests
that raising growth would require (i) fiscal policies that do not crowd out the private sector
and which direct resources to higher public investment; (ii) completion of reforms to
revitalize the important cotton sector and reform the port and utilities; and (iii) a better
business environment. With the right mix of fiscal and structural policies, staff concurred
that the longer-term growth rate could be raised to 6-7 percent, a level more consistent with
achieving the MDGs.
13.
Over the next few years, achievable growth rates are expected to be more
moderate and to continue to be highly sensitive to cotton sector performance. Assuming
a favorable external environment (i.e., continued global expansion, strong growth in Nigeria,
and more stable cotton and oil prices), the agreed medium-term macroeconomic framework
calls for annual real GDP growth of 4½-5½ percent in 2006–08, in line with performance
before Benin’s recent slowdown (Text Table 2). It assumes a continuing recovery of cotton
production, which even after the rebound in 2006 remains well below potential capacity, 5
higher re-exports to Nigeria, and increased trade and transport activity as the port’s one-stop

According to World Bank estimates, cotton production capacity amounts to 600-650,000 tons.

shop yields efficiency gains. Supported in part by fiscal space opened up for public
investment by higher domestic revenue and debt relief, the investment/GDP ratio would rise
to about 22½ percent in 2008, from about 20 percent in 2005. The assumptions are consistent
with an inflation rate contained within the WAEMU limit of 3 percent, which would prevent
further real exchange rate appreciation, and a narrowing of the external current account
deficit to 6.5 percent of GDP by 2008.

14.
The medium-term growth outlook faces downside risks. The factors that could
dampen growth include a further slump in cotton production (owing to bad weather,
inefficient management of the ginning companies, slower-than expected reform outcomes, or
a further decline in world prices); a resurgence of oil prices; renewed trade tensions with
main trading partners; weak absorptive and institutional capacity; and slower-than-expected
disbursement of programmed aid flows. If world cotton prices do indeed drop, the authorities
would reduce the producer price and/or effect a fiscal adjustment to accommodate a
government subsidy. They are also committed to passing the bulk of future oil price increases
on to consumers while establishing safety net measures to protect vulnerable groups. Failure
to gain public support either for the privatization program or for structural reforms to
improve the business climate (e.g., judiciary and land tenure reforms) pose longer-term risks.
On the positive side, the rapid response of the trade and transport sectors to port reforms and
better trade relations with Nigeria illustrates the potential for reforms to translate into
economic growth.

15
B. Medium-Term Fiscal Strategy: Carving Space for Higher Pro-Poor Spending
15.
Benin’s fiscal program seeks further fiscal consolidation while implementing the
poverty reduction strategy in the post-MDRI era. The authorities underscored the urgent
need to improve the poor’s access to basic services through higher and more efficient
spending in priority sectors. Total government spending is set to increase by about
2 percentage points of GDP in 2006-2008, supported by revenue gains equivalent to
1½ percent of GDP, debt service savings freed through MDRI debt relief, and additional aid
inflows (Text table 3). The envisaged medium-term fiscal program takes account of the
deficit of the public pension fund and assumes the elimination of the narrowly defined
primary deficit by 2008, consistent with the WAEMU’s fiscal convergence criteria.6

Including debt service savings from MDRI debt relief.

16.
Achievement of the targeted revenue increase hinges on measures that combat
fiscal fraud, reduce tax evasion, and broaden the tax base. Given Benin’s relatively high
taxation of the formal sector and its commitments under the WAEMU, there is limited scope
for new tax policy measures. Under the authorities’ program, the bulk of revenue increases
would stem from strengthened tax and customs administration, including (i) further
improvements in the management of the medium- and large-taxpayer units (especially by
revising the turnover threshold so as to refocus the large taxpayer unit (LTU)’s activities on
the largest taxpayers and computerizing more tax assessment and collection operations); (ii)
6

These are: (i) non negative narrowly defined fiscal primary balance, (ii) non accumulation of domestic
payment arrears; (iii) wage and salaries relative to tax revenue not larger than 35 percent, (iv) ratio of
domestically financed investment to tax revenue not smaller than 20 percent, and (v) tax revenue to GDP ratio
not less than 17 percent.

16
better customs control of imported goods through efficient operation of the one-stop shop at
the Port of Cotonou; (iii) better exchanges of taxpayer data between the General Tax and
Customs Directorates; (iv) modernization of the property tax; and (v) introduction of a
Unified Taxpayer Identification Number. Other revenue measures could include moderate
increases in excise tax rates based on recommendations from the Fund’s Fiscal Affairs
Department.7 The authorities indicated readiness to address revenue shortfalls with
appropriate corrective policy measures, including spending cuts, to ensure preservation of
program budgetary targets.
17.
Containment of the wage bill and an orderly settlement of outstanding wage
arrears to civil servants would provide space for priority spending.8 By limiting
recruitment to retrenched and retiring staff numbers, the authorities would both keep
medium-term civil service employment broadly stable and hold the wage bill at about
5½ percent of GDP, bringing it
within the WAEMU ceiling of
35 percent of tax revenue (from
39 percent at year-end 2005). In
response to staff advice to avoid
faster-than-programmed settlement
of sizable wage arrears to civil
servants (7.1 percent of 2006 GDP),
the authorities said they would keep
2007–08 annual wages and wage
arrears payments at 6.2 percent of
GDP, the projected outturn for
2006.

The mission discussed the
scope for front-loading progrowth and pro-poor outlays and
accommodating additional aid inflows. MDRI debt relief from the IMF, the World Bank,
and the African Development Bank—US$1,112 million (25 percent of 2005 GDP)—has
reduced Benin’s total external public debt to about 13 percent of GDP (Text table 4).
Cognizant of the potential new borrowing space, the authorities are considering an ambitious
public works program to revamp Benin’s ailing economic and social infrastructure. The
mission stressed the need to preserve debt sustainability and warned against wasteful

An FAD technical assistance mission visited Cotonou October 10-23, 2006.

Facing a severe financial crisis in the late 1980s, the government froze civil service wages in 1987 and
suspended the financial benefits of automatic, time-in-grade-based-promotions. The granting of general annual
wage increases was resumed in 1991, but the gap between actual and grade-based salaries was not closed until
2004, giving rise to estimated wage arrears to civil servants of 7.1 percent of GDP at year-end 2006.

17
borrowing. Although the risks to medium-term debt sustainability are estimated to be
moderate, the staff strongly urged the authorities to assess future loans on a case-by-case
basis, taking account of concessionality, cost-benefit analysis, absorption capacity
considerations, and Benin’s commitments under the PRGF arrangement.9 The mission also
encouraged the authorities to work closely with development partners to plan and cost the
envisaged infrastructure rehabilitation program. In the meantime, the authorities agreed to
limit use of resources freed through MDRI debt relief to debt-service savings (approximately
½ percent of GDP per year). These are to be allocated to priority sector spending (primarily
education, health, and infrastructure projects). These debt relief resources would be topped
up by a grant of US$307 million (7 percent of GDP) from the US Millennium Challenge
Account (MCA) to be disbursed over a five-year period beginning in October 2006.10

The authorities expressed strong commitment to the strict observance of
expenditure execution procedures. In April 2006, the minister of finance formally
prohibited the use of ad hoc Treasury Payments Orders (Ordres de Paiement Trésor),
instruments that have boosted past extrabudgetary outlays. In 2007, as part of a medium-term
strategy to enhance public expenditure management, the authorities will also begin

Annex IV provides an updated DSA. Although Benin’s external debt remains largely sustainable
under the baseline scenario, slow growth, volatile export prices and output, and new nonconcessional
borrowing could undermine external debt sustainability, placing the country at a moderate risk of debt
distress.

The program’s contribution to GDP growth is estimated to average 0.3 percentage point a year
during 2007-17. Annual MCA grant disbursements (between 0.3 and 1.4 percent of GDP per year
during 2006-11) are not expected to pose challenges to macroeconomic stability.

implementing the recommendations of a recent FAD TA mission. Proposed measures include
strengthening government expenditure tracking, securing the automatic generation of the
summary table of government financial operations, and consolidating government accounts.
20.
The authorities are pressing ahead with preparations for civil service reform,
with help from the World Bank and other donors. They will implement an integrated
information management system for the civil service over the next three years, subject to
financing availability. Key reform measures for 2007 include consolidating deconcentrated
personnel management in the education ministry and assessing other large ministries’
readiness to take over their human resources management, finalizing job descriptions and
qualifications and skill requirements for high-level positions, and adopting a civil service
Code of Ethics and Conduct. These steps are paving the way for new performance
assessment and merit-based remuneration systems, expected to be introduced by 2008. The
authorities are also seeking to restore the civil service pension fund’s medium-term financial
viability, although no visible progress has been made thus far. The staff stressed the need to
expedite the preparation and implementation of envisaged pension reforms.
C. Enhancing External Competitiveness Through Structural Reforms
21.
Privatization of the utilities, port, and cotton sectors—an essential part of the
authorities’ growth strategy—will take time. With World Bank staff taking the lead, the
mission and the authorities reached agreement on a revised structural reform agenda that
would (i) complete government withdrawal from commercial activities in the cotton sector
by mid-2007; (ii) bring to point of sale the state-owned electricity company by the end of
August 2007; and (iii) start operations of the consolidated electronic billing system at the
centralized clearing and invoicing management center by the end of December 2006 (see
MEFP, paras. 24-27). The authorities also plan to bring the telecommunications company to
the point of sale before end-January 2009. This is slower than World Bank staff advised.
However, the authorities were of the view that time was needed to put in place a new
management team, prepare a diagnostic of the telecom parastatal, and restructure the
company first. They also noted that the measures planned for the cotton and electricity
sectors would stretch their implementation capacity. Staff strongly encouraged the authorities
to expedite the timetable for the telecom privatization, originally planned for end-2005, in
order not to lose the momentum for reform.
22.
The government has also initiated second-generation economic reforms designed
to eliminate critical structural impediments.11 The program aims to (i) improve access to
markets; (ii) improve access to land (and thus increase investment in and the value of
parcels); (iii) facilitate access to credit for micro-, small-, and medium-scale enterprises; and
(iv) improve the business environment through judiciary reform. To enhance trade, besides

19
continued port improvements, the staff urged the authorities to help dismantle the remaining
intraregional trade barriers in the WAEMU.
23.
Although Benin’s financial system is weak, most banks appear to meet key
prudential norms (text table 5). The banking system has been steadily growing, with
nominal bank deposits increasing by about 9 percent a year and credit to the private sector
expanding from 4 percent to 19 percent of GDP during 1995–2005. At the end of July 2006,
12 banks and 2 leasing companies were licensed to operate; nonperforming loans were about
10 percent of total assets. Recent positive developments include the completion of reforms to
address governance and other portfolio weaknesses in two banks previously overseen by the
regional Banking Commission. However, in one of these banks, the capital ratio remains
negative. The heavy concentration of loans in a limited number of sectors (and companies) is
a potential source of vulnerability that must be closely monitored.

D. Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) Issues
24.
The authorities are revising the PRSP. Since the strategy’s approval in 2003, the
government has issued two annual progress reports (APR), one in December 2004 and one in
August 2005; a third APR is expected to be finalized before end-2006. For the ongoing
revision, the authorities have completed a modular survey of household living conditions
(EMICOV) to improve knowledge of the poverty profile, conducted broad participatory
consultations, and developed a consensus on the strategic priorities for the update PRSP
(PRSP II), including a renewed emphasis on private sector-led economic growth. PRSP II is
to be completed in December 2006.

20
E. Program Monitoring Issues and Capacity to Repay the Fund
25.
In the attached Letter of Intent, the authorities request completion of the first
review under the PRGF-supported program. They explained that the missed performance
criterion on domestic arrears partly arose from pre-election spending pressures and
inadequate spending controls that have now been addressed; they have initiated an audit of
the arrears and would devise a plan for their resolution by year-end. The end-December 2005
start up of the centralized clearing and invoicing management center of the Port of Cotonou
had been effected with a delay. But to signal their broader commitment to structural reform,
in view of several missed structural benchmarks, the government would as a prior action for
completing the review approve disengagement strategies from commercial activities in the
cotton, telecommunications, and electricity sectors. Finally, the broken obligation to neither
contract nor guarantee nonconcessional loans reflected a perceived urgent need by the
previous government to secure finance for restructuring the telecommunications company,
against the advice of Benin’s debt management committee. The new administration has
underscored the unit’s crucial technical and advisory role, and agreed henceforth to neither
contract nor guarantee nonconcessional loans.
26.
The mission welcomed the actions to address missed performance criteria and
structural benchmarks. It pointed out, however, that staff had advised the previous
government against the guarantee of the nonconcessional loan to the telecommunications
company; therefore, the new government’s strong commitment to avoid such guarantees or
loans in the remainder of the program would be important. Prior actions (see paragraph 3 of
the LOI and paragraph 29 of the MEFP) largely aimed at demonstrating the authorities’
commitment in the areas of missed program conditionality have been implemented.
27.
Proposed program conditionality for 2006 and 2007 includes measures to resume
stalled privatization of the state-owned cotton and electricity companies (MEFP, Table
2). While outside the core expertise of the Fund, reform in these sectors (as noted in the ExPost Assessment of Performance under Fund-Supported Programs—Country Report 04/371)
is seen as macro-critical. Other structural conditionality encompasses efforts to improve
accountability in budget management and deepen port reforms. The World Bank is playing a
key role in supporting the authorities’ sectoral reforms.
28.
The program is fully financed for 2006 and 2007. Financing needs are being met
by donor assistance mostly from the World Bank, the African Development Bank, and the
European Union. In consultation with staff, the authorities have realigned program
monitoring with the budget cycle (calendar year), and established quarterly performance
criteria and indicative targets to monitor program implementation (MEFP, Tables 1 and 2).
The program continues to include adjusters on domestic financing for deviations from
external programmed budget assistance.

21
29.
Benin is expected to preserve its excellent record in meeting its Fund obligations.
During the program period, the annual average repayment to the IMF would be
SDR 0.021 million, only 0.006 percent of export of goods and services and 0.005 percent of
government revenue by 2008.
F. Statistical and Other Issues and Disclosure
30.
Despite some statistical weaknesses in the national accounts, monetary
aggregates, and social indicators, Benin's economic database is adequate for program
monitoring purposes. Benin participates in the General Data Dissemination Standard, and
posts its metadata on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board. Fiscal data only
covers the central government, and the reporting of such data needs strengthening; the
authorities are currently receiving technical assistance in this area from both AFRITAC-West
and FAD.
31.
The mission sought civil society’s and the private sector’s views on the Fund’s
policy dialogue with the government. Union leaders strongly opposed the privatization
program, expressing concern over anticipated personnel retrenchments. Staff stressed the
reform’s potential benefits, especially its positive impact on competitiveness, economic
growth, and poverty alleviation. Representatives of the private sector largely agreed with
Benin’s IMF-supported reform policies; they called for a strengthening of their dialogue with
the government on economic policy issues.

IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
32.
Following a decade of strong and low inflationary growth, Benin’s economic
performance has considerably weakened in the last few years because of slow progress
in addressing core economic vulnerabilities. In 2005, per capita income growth fell to zero.
Absent a considerable revival of growth, progress toward the millennium development goals
(MDGs) will be limited.
33.
To revitalize the economy, the new government is developing a comprehensive
growth strategy that is broadly consistent with Benin’s core commitments under the
PRGF-supported program. The strategy’s focus on macroeconomic stability, economic
diversification, good governance, accelerated structural reforms, and more public
involvement in policy-making processes is well-placed. Full implementation would help
raise real GDP growth to 6-7 percent, the level needed to facilitate progress toward the
MDGs.
34.
However, reform efforts, even if implemented speedily, will take time to gestate,
limiting growth potential over the next few years. The authorities can, nonetheless,
minimize significant downside risks to the medium-term macroeconomic framework by
ensuring an effective transfer of cotton-ginning factories to the private sector by mid-2007,

22
creating fiscal space for more public investment, and continuing to address obstacles to doing
business.
35.
Staff welcomes the new government’s determination to expedite implementation
of hitherto stalled structural reforms. Delays in implementing reforms are regrettable.
However, the authorities are to be commended for decisive steps to resume, with technical
support from World Bank staff, the long-delayed privatization of the cotton and electricity
companies, and give new impetus to efforts to enhance the competitiveness of the Port of
Cotonou. With the opening of the port's centralized clearing and invoicing management
center and the progressive development of its operations, port clearing operations are being
facilitated, including through consolidating information supplied on numerous port service
bills at a single window. Work will be needed in 2007 to continue developing functionality,
including for direct bank settlement. The reform is reducing the incidence of customs
corruption and should also help enhance the port’s competitiveness. Along with better trade
relations with neighbors, the port’s one-stop shop is already having a positive impact on
activity in the trade and transport sectors. While the staff recognizes the constraints imposed
by limited implementation capacity, the two-year delay in the telecom privatization is
regrettable. Strong steps will need to be taken to expedite the reform process with a view to
ensuring an early state disengagement from the sector.
36.
Second-generation reforms aimed at reducing impediments to private sector
investment are an important next step. Such measures include improving Benin’s judicial
and land tenure systems and facilitating credit access to more small- and medium-sized
enterprises. Together with the ongoing privatization program, these initiatives will support
private sector development and permit diversification of the production and export base, thus
enhancing the economy’s resilience to external shocks. A resolute and timely implementation
of the reforms is crucial especially considering the erosion of competitiveness since the 1994
devaluation, as reflected in a steady appreciation of the real effective exchange rate. In line
with this strategy, staff urges the authorities to expedite reform of the domestic petroleum
products distribution sector, including an early reestablishment of the flexible price fixing
mechanism.
37.
The government rightly underscores the need to preserve macroeconomic
stability over the medium term. Consistent with this, the authorities need to focus on
reversing recent lackluster revenue performance, and maintaining spending at levels
compatible with continued fiscal viability. To protect poverty reducing expenditures,
personnel outlays need to be closely monitored and contained at levels consistent with the
relevant provisions of the WAEMU’s Growth and Stability Pact.
38.
Scaling up of pro-growth outlays in the post-MDRI era must take account of
existing capacity constraints while preserving the viability of Benin’s external position.
The multilateral debt relief initiative has brought Benin’s debt burden to relatively low levels,
and opened room for increases in pro-growth and pro-poor spending. Against a backdrop of a

23
much improved debt outlook, the authorities have initiated preparations for an ambitious
infrastructure rehabilitation program. Financing for the program should be obtained on terms
that do not put debt sustainability at risk over time. All planned projects should undergo
extensive cost-benefit analysis and be financed by highly concessional loans.
39.
Staff recommends the completion of the first review under the PRGF
arrangement. Benin’s macroeconomic performance remains broadly on track following
efforts to address fiscal slippage in the early part of this year. Implementation of the
structural program has been disappointing resulting in several benchmarks being missed. But
the new administration has resumed long-delayed reforms, including the privatization
program for key sectors. Given the recent approval of the government’s disengagement
strategies for the cotton and electricity sectors, ownership appears strong, and the staff
expects reform progress to improve. The new government has also begun to address
unplanned domestic arrears and has said it will abstain from borrowing or guaranteeing loans
on nonconcessional terms. The guaranteeing of a nonconcessional loan to Benin Telecoms by
the previous government was ill-advised and the authorities will need to more closely heed
their debt management committee’s recommendations in the future. That aside, on balance,
staff supports the authorities’ request for waivers with regard to the missed performance
criteria.
40.
The main risk to the program pertains to possible policy reversals should the
authorities fail to rally domestic support for the structural reform measures. Other risk
factors include renewed tensions in trade with regional partners, a weakening of world cotton
prices, and difficulties in raising revenue to program targets. To contain such risks, the
authorities must deepen and expedite their reform agenda, including maintenance of spending
at levels compatible with medium-term fiscal viability. Staff welcomes ongoing efforts in
this direction and urges the government to stay the course.
41.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Benin take place within
24 months subject to the provisions of the decision on consultation cycles in program
countries.

Appendix I. Benin: Letter of Intent
Republic of Benin
Ministry of Development, Economy,
And Finance

Cotonou, October 29, 2006

The Minister
To:
Mr. Rodrigo de Rato
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431

Dear Sir:

The implementation of Benin’s reform program under the Poverty Reduction and Growth
Facility (PRGF) has been broadly satisfactory during 2005-2006. Discussions with Fund staff
in the context of the first program review found that all but two of the performance criteria
for the period were met.
The missed performance criteria pertain to the program requirements that the authorities not
accumulate domestic payments arrears and neither contract nor guarantee nonconcessional
debt. At end-June 30, 2006, domestic payments arrears accumulated in FY 2005 stood at
about CFAF 33 billion (1.3 percent of 2006 GDP). With technical assistance from the World
Bank, the government is carrying out a comprehensive evaluation of these arrears. The audit
report, which is expected to be completed by December 2006, will include an arrears
clearance plan. During the same period, the government guaranteed CFAF17.4 billion (US$
31.3 million) in nonconcessional borrowing by Benin Télécoms, the state-owned telephone
company. Also, the government did not meet the program’s quantitative benchmarks for
domestic revenue mobilization and the wage bill for the first review test date of
September 30, 2005.
The government has taken the necessary steps to address existing weaknesses in the areas of
missed performance criteria and to ensure that relevant targets and commitments are fully
observed in the future. In particular, the government has enhanced Treasury cash-flow
monitoring by establishing a cash-flow committee headed by the Minister of Finance. The

31
corrective measures taken to ramp up budget tracking should prevent accumulation of new
domestic payments arrears. Furthermore, the government reaffirms herewith its commitment
to no longer contract or guarantee nonconcessional loans in the future. In light of the
remedial actions undertaken, the government requests waivers of nonobservance of the
missed performance criteria; it also requests that the first PRGF review be completed and
related PRGF resources disbursed.
Benin achieved economic growth of 2.9 percent in 2005, which is projected to rebound to
4.5 percent in 2006, driven by strong performance in the agricultural sector with a substantial
recovery of cotton production, and by an up tick of activity in the trade and transport sectors.
The recovery of the two sectors reflects smoother trade flows with Nigeria and a substantial
improvement in the performance of the port of Cotonou. The government is determined to
further strengthen growth and reduce poverty and will continue to pursue generally prudent
macroeconomic policies, while expediting implementation of its structural reform agenda. It
wishes to benefit from Fund technical and financial assistance under the program supported
by the PRGF arrangement, which was approved by the IMF Executive Board on August 5,
2005.
The government authorizes the IMF to publish the staff report and other documents
pertaining to the discussions under the first program review.

Truly yours,

/s/

Appendix I Attachment I
Benin. Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies for 2006-07
I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Since the adoption of its medium-term economic program supported by the
International Monetary Fund under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility
(PRGF), the government has taken measures to consolidate progress made under
previous programs and to lay the foundations for a new, second-generation, reform
agenda. The reform efforts aim to consolidate fiscal sustainability and improve the
institutional environment, strengthen the country’s socioeconomic infrastructure, and
promote exports and economic diversification. They should enhance economic
competitiveness, give new impetus to growth, and accelerate progress toward the Millennium
Development Goals.
2.
The PRGF-supported program provides a framework for preserving
macroeconomic stability and creating conditions for greater involvement of the private
sector in the economy. In this context, the government is pushing resolutely ahead with its
fiscal consolidation program, and promoting modernization of public utilities by privatizing
the state-owned enterprises operating in this sector. In agriculture and transport, reforms are
focused for the most part on government disengagement from the cotton sector, and on
modernization of the autonomous Port of Cotonou.
3.
This memorandum reviews progress made since the adoption of the program
supported by the PRGF arrangement and presents the policies and measures that the
government proposes to implement in the last quarter of 2006 and in 2007 to achieve its
objectives under the program.

II. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND PERFORMANCE UNDER THE PROGRAM
Recent economic developments and outlook for end-2006
4.
Continuing a downturn experienced since 2002, real GDP growth decelerated to
2.9 percent in 2005. The economic slowdown reflects the decline in the level of activity in
the primary sector, particularly in cotton production, despite some improvement in trade
relations with Nigeria and the resumption of activity at the Port of Cotonou, which stimulated
trade and transport services. Owing to the twofold impact of the food crisis in neighboring
Niger on the prices of foodstuffs and of the rising prices of petroleum products on energy and
transport, inflation rose to an annual average of 5.4 percent, largely exceeding the West
African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) convergence criterion. The external

33
current account deficit (excluding official transfers) narrowed slightly to 7.2 percent of GDP,
compared with 7.9 percent in 2004. Although exports shrank because of the sharp drop in
cotton prices, the decline in imports was even greater, particularly those of capital goods and
petroleum products by financially-strained SONACOP, the dominant domestic oil
distributor.
5.
Economic growth should be more robust in 2006 rising to 4.5 percent of GDP. It
will be driven by the recovery of the cotton sector and benefit from the impact of both the
reforms in the port sector and smoother trade relations with Nigeria. Inflation should ease to
3 percent, consistent with the relevant WAEMU convergence criterion. The external current
account deficit is expected to stabilize around 7 percent of GDP, notably on account of good
cotton exports performance.
6.
In 2005, tax revenue was below target essentially owing to poor performance at
the Directorate General of Taxes (DGID). Domestic tax revenues fell to the equivalent of
6.9 percent of GDP, as compared with 7.3 percent of GDP in 2004. Contributing factors
include: (i) a slowdown in economic activity; (ii) technical difficulties in the management of
tax credits, particularly for the VAT and BIC; (iii) delayed deployment of human and
physical resources under the 2005 performance contract for the revenue collection agency;
and (iv) exemption of a large proportion of workers in the private and public sectors from
personal income tax in application of relevant provisions of the 2005 budget law. Customs
revenues increased slightly to 7.5 percent of GDP (7.3 percent in 2004), in particular
following a sharp reduction in exemptions. Total revenue reached 16.5 percent of GDP,
compared with an initial program target of 17.4 percent of GDP.
7.
Because of suffered revenue shortfalls and lower-than-expected external
financial assistance, spending was cut to ensure achievement of the main fiscal
objectives for 2005. As a result, poverty reduction spending accounted for only 24 percent of
total primary expenditure, as against a target of 28 percent; and the overall fiscal deficit was
contained at 4.6 percent of GDP, compared with a target of 5.3 percent of GDP and an
outturn of 3.7 percent of GDP in 2004. The efforts were somewhat frustrated by considerable
extrabudgetary spending effected through the use of ad hoc Treasury Payment Orders and by
the settling of all outstanding invoices carried over from FY 2004. This contributed to the
accumulation of CFAF 63 billion in unpaid 2005 invoices at end-year. By June 30, 2006, the
unpaid bills carried over from 2005 had been reduced to CFAF 33 billion, reflecting a
decisive government effort to clear these potential arrears in the first half of the year. The
outstanding balance is being audited with World Bank assistance in an effort to gauge their
validity and develop a related settlement plan by end-December 2006.
8.
The budgetary situation sharply deteriorated during the first four months of
2006. While revenue was slightly below the initial estimate, large expenditures were effected
in connection with the presidential elections and substantial financial support was provided to
some problem sectors, in particular cotton. Assistance to the latter sector comprised carried-

34
over subsidies from 2004/05 (0.3 percent of GDP), unsettled fertilizer charges (0.2 percent of
GDP), and various debts to cotton farmers (0.1 percent of GDP). Other payments were made
to clear the outstanding Treasury invoices from FY 2005. As result, the government’s cashflow position deteriorated sharply, prompting the authorities to borrow heavily from the
banking system.
9.
Determined action is being taken to meet the main fiscal targets for FY 2006.
Since April, measures have been introduced to restore fiscal discipline and ensure
achievement of the program objectives for the year. With a view to improving revenue
performance, the authorities have notably intensified the audit of major taxes (including VAT
and mobile telephone company royalties), and strengthened efforts to streamline tax credit
management. Major personnel changes have also been made in the Directorate General of
Customs and Indirect Taxes (DGDDI), with a view to enhancing the effectiveness of the
department. This should be better equipped to perform its dual mission of facilitating foreign
trade and collecting government revenue. With respect to expenditure, resort to ad hoc
Treasury payment orders which have been used for extrabudgetary spending in the past, has
been prohibited, and would only be effected under exceptional circumstances. At the same
time, the government has set up a treasury committee to track more closely revenue and
expenditure and to match government resources with commitments. As a result, revenue
should stabilize at around 16.5 percent of GDP and expenditure be contained at 21.5 percent
of GDP, making possible the reduction of the primary fiscal deficit (in the narrow sense) to
the programmed equivalent of 0.4 percent of GDP (0.9 percent including spending with
resources freed through MDRI debt relief). Estimated at 2 percent of GDP, the residual
financing gap identified for FY 2006 will be covered mainly by assistance from the World
Bank, African Development Bank, and the European Union.
10.
Monetary policy, which is conducted by the Central Bank of West African States
(BCEAO), continued to focus on strengthening the basis for the CFA franc peg to the
Euro. Revision by the BCEAO of the methodology for estimating currency in circulation
resulted in an upward adjustment of Benin’s contribution to the official foreign exchange
reserves of the BCEAO. In addition, as credit to the government was scaled back, it was
possible to substantially increase credit to the private sector in 2005. However, this trend
weakened in 2006, reflecting in part the high required reserve ratio that was raised to
15 percent in mid-2005.1 Money supply continues to grow at a faster rate than nominal GDP,
despite the downtick expected in 2006, reflecting a gradual strengthening of the demand for
money.

1

The BCEAO made the adjustment in 2005 in a situation due to pressures on domestic prices and
risks of capital flight in the run up to the last presidential election. A downward revision of the
required reserve ratio is currently being considered.

35
Program implementation
11.
Benin’s macrobudgetary situation remained broadly on track, while progress in
structural reforms was limited. Despite recorded revenue shortfalls and strong pressures on
the wage bill, spending is generally managed in a manner that helps keep fiscal balances
within programmed limits. In contrast to broadly satisfactory developments in the
macroeconomic area, the government has yet to complete its programmed disengagement
from the cotton, telecommunications, and electricity sectors. Only in the port sector have the
authorities achieved measured tangible progress. In some cases, delays in the implementation
of structural reforms have been caused by lags in mobilizing required technical assistance; in
others, the initial reform timetable appears to have been too ambitious (Tables 1 and 2).

III. ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL POLICIES FOR 2007
A. Macroeconomic Framework
12.
The government is determined to give new impetus to economic reforms. After a
decade of relatively strong growth, Benin has experienced a slowdown in economic activity
since 2002. Several factors explain this development, in particular the deterioration in the
terms of trade, mainly due to declining cotton prices on the world market and spiraling
petroleum product prices, the loss of competitiveness related to the appreciation of the
currency, and major delays in the implementation of structural reforms. The authorities are
determined to decisively tackle these difficulties by tightening the fiscal stance as necessary
to maintain macroeconomic stability; they are also committed to reinvigorating Benin’s
stalled structural reform agenda.
13.
Real GDP growth should continue the upward trend started in 2006, reaching
5.1 percent in 2007. The anticipated rebound of economic activity is mainly attributable to
the recovery of the cotton sector, the further easing of tensions in trade relations with
Nigeria, as well as the impact of structural reforms undertaken, in particular at the Port of
Cotonou. Over the three year period to 2008, the real GDP growth rate is expected to average
4.5 - 5.5 percent, with inflation remaining within the WAEMU convergence ceiling of
3 percent. Reflecting mostly the expected recovery of cotton exports, the external position is
expected to improve somewhat in 2007; and the external current account deficit would
slightly narrow to 6.7 percent of GDP, down from 7 percent in 2006.
14.
Growth would be even stronger beyond 2008, underpinned by the
competitiveness gains from, and newfound dynamism of, the reformed energy,
telecommunications, and cotton ginning sectors. Over that time horizon, economic
performance would also benefit from rehabilitated economic and social infrastructure, as well
as the improvement in the business climate in the wake of the reform of the judicial and land
tenure systems, and greater access to credit for SMEs. These reforms will be financed, inter

36
alia, with resources from the Millennium Challenge Account. The financial support expected
from that source is US$307 million over five years.2
15.
Given its systemic economic role, the government has undertaken a far-reaching
program to overhaul the petroleum products distribution sector. In this context,
management of SONACOP, the dominant oil importing company, is being closely
monitored. In a move to halt the deterioration of the company’s financial situation and to
mitigate its negative impact on the economy, the government had initially seized control of
the (privatized) company, and taken strong measures to secure its supply sources. The
measures have helped restore the availability of petroleum products on the formal market, but
the government remains committed to the principle of private management of SONACOP. In
consultation with its development partners, the authorities intend to develop an appropriate
state disengagement strategy aimed at revitalizing the petroleum product distribution sector.
B. Fiscal Policy
16.
The program for 2007 aims to bolster Benin’s fiscal consolidation efforts so as to
preserve fiscal sustainability while increasing spending to support growth and poverty
reduction. Revenue collection should reach the level of initial program target of 17.2 percent
of GDP, compared with 16.5 percent of GDP in 2006. The fiscal program targets a primary
fiscal deficit equivalent to 0.5 percent of GDP, with the overall deficit (cash basis, excluding
grants) contained at 5.8 percent of GDP.
17.
In 2007, revenue mobilization efforts will focus on strengthening the efficiency of
tax and customs administration, with technical support from AFRITAC West and the
IMF’s Fiscal Affairs Department (FAD).3 The increase in direct and indirect tax revenue will
reflect the full effect of the DGID’s performance contract, better tracking of taxpayers by the
Large Taxpayer Unit (DGE),4 and the Medium-Sized Enterprise Tax Center (CIME). These
units will be better equipped, particularly with computers, and staffed to ensure higher
revenue collection, including of tax arrears, and the necessary streamlining of the system of
tax credits. On the customs side (DGDDI), the main focus is on simplifying customs
clearance procedures with the effective operation of the port’s one-stop shop, better import
valuations, stepped-up efforts to control smuggling, especially by water, and tracking of
exemptions.

The agreements for access to these resources were signed in Washington, D.C. (USA) in February
2006.

An FAD technical assistance mission visited Cotonou during October 10-23, 2006.

The minimum turnover threshold for enterprises coming under the DGE was recently increased to
rationalize the directorate’s workload and refocus its activities on the very largest taxpayers.

37
18.
On the expenditure side, nonpriority expenditures will be rigorously monitored
to ensure realization of the program’s fiscal targets. In this context, the government has
identified the spending categories that would be subject to cuts to compensate for eventual
revenue shortfalls. The wage bill is to fully reflect the government’s current obligations to its
permanent workers, and the employment and remuneration policy will be guided by the
commitment to fully comply with the relevant WAEMU convergence criterion. The
government is continuing preparations for its civil service modernization program. Under the
latter civil service employment would be determined with a view to ensuring an effective
operation of government services. The civil service reform program also aims to provide
permanent government employees with competitive salaries and benefits, while keeping the
wage bill below one third of fiscal revenues. Clearance of the outstanding stock of wage
arrears will be effected in annual installments that are compatible with agreed fiscal targets
under the program. In particular, care will be taken to ensure that annual personnel
expenditure, including wage arrears, does not exceed the equivalent of 6.2 percent of GDP,
the level achieved in 2006.
19.
Other current primary expenditure will be limited to CFAF 200.9 billion
(7.5 percent of GDP), or an increase of 13 percent. The increased spending appropriations
provide financing for a more effective implementation of the poverty reduction strategy that
seeks to further improve access to education and health services and to safe drinking water
for the vulnerable populations. The investment budget will also focus on the priority sectors
and be limited to approximately CFAF 94.1 billion, or an increase of 7.7 percent over last
year’s level. Efforts are made to improve the tracking of public expenditure, notably by
strengthening the operating budget of permanent secretariat of the National Commission for
Poverty Reduction and Development (CNDLP) that monitors the implementation of the PRS,
and by enhancing the efficiency of the expenditure-tracking and project execution units in the
civil service. Expenditure without prior commitment orders, particularly expenditure that are
effected with ad hoc Treasury payment orders, will only be executed in exceptional cases of
extreme urgency.
20.
Benin has obtained debt relief under the Multilateral Debt Reduction Initiative
(MDRI). It has been agreed that additional spending with resources freed through MDRI
debt relief will primarily be allocated to projects in education and health, to facilitate
achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). In 2007, expenditure financed
with MDRI resources should total CFAF 15 billion (0.6 percent of GDP).
21.
In light of the above, the narrowly defined primary and overall fiscal deficits
(commitment basis, excluding grants) are projected to stand at 0.5 percent of GDP and
5.1 percent of GDP, respectively; the former remaining broadly in line with initial program
targets. Taking into account a targeted net reduction in domestic payments arrears of CFAF
13 billion, the government’s overall net borrowing requirements are expected to be fully
covered. The main sources of budgetary support identified are: (i) World Bank: CFAF

38
15 billion; (ii) European Union: CFAF 21 billion; (iii) African Development Bank: CFAF
11 billion; and (iv) other development partners: CFAF 10 billion.
C. Money and Credit
22.
Monetary policy will be conducted by the BCEAO at the regional level.
Government borrowing from the banking system will be prudent, and monetary policy aimed
at ensuring moderate inflation and expansion of credit to the economy, reduced risk of capital
flight, and preservation of Benin’s comfortable contribution to the international reserves of
the regional central bank. Broad money is projected to increase by 12.3 percent in 2007,
more than the expansion of nominal GDP, as compared with 2.9 percent in 2006. Treasury
securities issued on the subregional financial market in July 2006 will be refinanced at
maturity on January 8, 2007, in the amount of CFAF 25.4 billion.
D. Balance of Payments and External debt
23.
In 2007, the external current account deficit, excluding grants, is projected to
narrow slightly to around 6.7 percent of GDP, from 7 percent of GDP in 2006. This
reflects mainly strong cotton exports for the 2006/07 season, following a sizable contraction
in 2006, and despite a moderate increase in the major import categories. The government
reaffirms its commitment to a prudent borrowing policy in the post-HIPC/MDRI era, to
protect Benin’s external debt sustainability. It is outlining an external debt policy that would
enable Benin to make good use of new loans contracted, without putting the external position
at risk, to secure financing for additional spending in support of growth and improved public
access to social services. In this vein, the government, with the support from the African
Development Bank, has initiated an exhaustive evaluation of the financing requirements for
its MDG. On that basis, it will start talks with its development partners on the sources and
nature of the funding needed, particularly as regards envisaged new loans. The government
intends to neither contract nor guarantee any additional nonconcessional loans.
E. Structural Policies
24.
In the structural area, the government’s main objectives are: (i) to put in place
modern regulatory frameworks for the energy and telecommunications sectors in 2007 and to
initiate the transfer of management of these two key sectors to private operators of
international repute ; (ii) to disengage from commercial activities in the cotton sector; and
(iii) to further enhance the competitiveness of the autonomous Port of Cotonou by, in
particular, offering the full range of activities at the management center for the one-stop shop
and preparing for the involvement of the private sector in the management of port facilities.
25.
In consultation with the World Bank, the government has conducted an
assessment of the electricity sector and developed measures and practical modalities for
implementing envisaged reforms. In August 2006, the government submitted to the World
Bank a document on its vision for the reform. After adopting the proposed strategy for

39
divestiture of SBEE (lease concession) in late October 2006, the government plans to launch
the call for bids and for expressions of interest before end-August 2007, with a view to
concluding a management contract with the selected strategic partner by end-January 2008.
26.
In the telecommunications sector, a regulatory framework has been defined to
govern the operation of the mobile and land-line telephone systems. The new members of
the regulatory board will soon be appointed. A consortium comprising an investment bank,
and audit firm, and a law firm is being recruited. The consortium will assist the government
in handling the Benin Télécoms privatization transaction and, in particular, will audit the
company’s financial statements and perform a strategic analysis of the enterprise (including
financial restructuring) to develop a transaction strategy and issue the call for bids. With
technical support from World Bank staff, the government has defined and formally approved
a timetable for the implementation of the transaction. Under the latter, the call for bids is
expected to be launched by end-January 2009, following a 24-month restructuring of the
company. In view of the constraints of a highly competitive sector, work on the rehabilitation
and recovery of Benin Télécoms should be carried out in parallel with the analysis and the
preparations for the call for bids.
27.
The government reaffirms its commitment to withdraw from commercial
activities in the cotton sector as of the end of the 2006/07 season. It has approved a
divestiture strategy for SONAPRA, including plans for the creation of a new, mainly
privately-owned, cotton ginning company with minor shareholding by the state, company
workers, and other entities active in the cotton industry. The new company is to start
operations by end-June 2007.
F. Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP)
28.
The government is updating its poverty reduction strategy (PRS) to improve the
effectiveness of this crucial instrument for the development of poverty reduction strategies
and policies. The updating of the PRS, the final version of which was adopted in 2003,
required an in-depth re-assessment of Benin’s poverty profile, which led to the conduct of a
modular survey of household living conditions (EMICOV). The new PRS emphasizes the
role of the private sector in the economy; its preparation benefited from the active
participation of members of civil society in the context of broad participatory consultations at
the national and regional levels. The new poverty reduction strategy paper (PRSP II) has just
been approved by the government and should be submitted to Benin’s development partners
in December 2006.
IV. PROGRAM MONITORING
29.
Completion of the first review of the arrangement under the PRGF for Benin is
subject to timely completion of the following prior actions: (i) adoption by the Council of
Ministers of the strategies for government disengagement from the cotton, electricity, and
telecommunications sectors, accompanied by a timetable for implementation of related key

40
reform measures, as stated in paragraphs 24-27 above; (ii) selection of an auditing firm to
assess the validity of outstanding domestic arrears and to develop an arrears clearance
strategy; and (iii) reaffirmation of the government’s commitment to neither guarantee nor
contract nonconcessional loans5. These measures were taken in October 2006.
30.
Program monitoring will be based on quarterly structural and quantitative
benchmarks and performance criteria (Tables 1 and 2). The authorities will report the data
necessary for program monitoring to the IMF, in accordance with the Technical
Memorandum of Understanding. During the program period, the government will not
introduce restrictions on payments and transfers on current international transactions, or
tighten any such restrictions, without first consulting the Fund; introduce or modify multiple
currency practices; conclude bilateral payments agreements not compatible with Article VIII
of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement; or introduce or intensify restrictions on imports for
balance of payments purposes.
31.
The second review of the arrangement under the PRGF will take place in midFebruary 2007.

5

In November 2005, the outgoing government guaranteed a nonconcessional loan contracted by the
telephone parastatal (Benin Telecoms) in an amount equivalent to US$ 31.3 million. The proceeds
were used to modernize obsolete equipment and enhance investor interest in the privatization
program.

Appendix I—Attachment II
Technical Memorandum of Understanding
October 29, 2006
1.
This technical memorandum of understanding defines the quantitative and structural
performance criteria and benchmarks for the program supported by the Poverty Reduction
and Growth Facility (PRGF). It also sets out the frequency and deadlines for data reporting to
the staff of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for program-monitoring purposes.
I.

DEFINITIONS

2.
Unless otherwise indicated, the government is defined as the central government of
the Republic of Benin and does not include local authorities, the central bank, or any other
public entity with autonomous legal personality that is not included in the table of
government financial operations (TOFE).
3.
The definitions of “debt” and “concessional borrowing” for the purposes of this
memorandum of understanding are as follows:
(a)

As set out in Point 9 of the Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to
Foreign Borrowing (Executive Board Decision No. 6230-(79/140), amended by
Executive Board Decision No. 12274-(00/85) (8/24/00), debt is understood to mean a
current, that is, not contingent, liability created under a contractual agreement through
the provision of value in the form of assets (including currency) or services, and
which requires the obligor to make one or more payments in the form of assets
(including currency) or services at some future points in time; these payments will
discharge the principal and/or interest liabilities incurred under the contract. Debt can
take a number of forms, the primary ones being as follows: (i) loans, that is, advances
of money to the obligor by the lender on the basis of an undertaking that the obligor
will repay the funds in the future (including deposits, bonds, debentures, commercial
loans, and buyers’ credits) and temporary exchanges of assets that are equivalent to
fully collateralized loans, under which the obligor is required to repay the funds, and
usually pay interest, by repurchasing the collateral from the buyer in the future (such
as repurchase agreements and official swap arrangements); (ii) suppliers’ credits, that
is, contracts where the supplier permits the obligor to defer payment until some time
after the date on which the goods are delivered or services are provided; and
(iii) leases, that is, arrangements under which property is provided that the lessee has
the right to use for one or more specified period(s) of time, that are usually shorter
than the total expected service life of the property, while the lessor retains the title to
the property. For the purpose of this guideline, the debt is the present value (at the
inception of the lease) of all lease payments expected to be made during the period of

45
the arrangement, excluding those payments that cover the operation, repair, or
maintenance of the property. Under this definition of debt set out above, arrears,
penalties, and judicially awarded damages arising from failure to make payment
under a contractual obligation that constitutes debt are debt. Failure to make payment
on an obligation that is not considered debt under this definition (e.g., payment on
delivery) will not give rise to debt.
(b)

A loan is considered concessional if, on the date the contract is signed, the ratio of
the present value of the loan, based on the reference interest rates, to the nominal
value of the loan is less than 65 percent (i.e., a grant element exceeding 35 percent).
The reference interest rates used in this assessment are the commercial interest
reference rates (CIRRs) established by the Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development (OECD). For debts with a maturity exceeding 15 years, the ten-year
reference interest rate published by the OECD is used to calculate the grant element.
For shorter maturities, the six-month market reference rate is used.
II.

QUANTITATIVE PERFORMANCE CRITERIA

A. Ceiling on Net Domestic Financing of the Government
Definition
4.
Net domestic financing of the government is defined as the sum of (i) net bank credit
to the government, as defined below, (ii) net nonbank financing of the government, including
the proceeds from the sale of government assets net of the cost of structural reforms to which
these proceeds are earmarked, and (iii) government treasury bills issued in CFAF on the
regional financial market of the WAEMU.
5.
Net bank credit to the government is defined as the balance between the liabilities and
claims of the government vis-à-vis the central bank and commercial banks. The scope of net
credit to the government is that used by the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO)
and is consistent with the established Fund practice in this area. It implies a broader
definition of government than that specified in paragraph 2. Claims of the government
include the CFA franc cash balance, postal checking accounts, subordinated debt (obligations
cautionnées), and all deposits with the BCEAO and commercial banks of public entities, with
the exception of industrial or commercial public entities (EPIC) and public enterprises, which
are excluded from the calculation. Government debt to the banking system includes all debt
to these same financial institutions.
6.
The net bank credit to the government and the net amount of government treasury
bills and bonds issued in CFAF in the regional financial market of the WAEMU are
calculated by the BCEAO, and nonbank financing is calculated by the Beninese Treasury,
whose figures are those deemed valid in the context of the program.

46
7.
The ceiling on the net domestic financing of the government will be adjusted if
disbursement of external budgetary assistance (excluding IMF financing and HIPC
assistance) net of debt service obligations (excluding IMF repayment obligations) and
payments of arrears, exceed or fall short of program forecasts. In the event of disbursement
in excess of more than CFAF 3 billion, the ceiling will be adjusted downward pro tanto by
the excess disbursement beyond CFAF 3 billion, unless they are used to absorb domestic
arrears. In contrast, if at the end of each quarter disbursements are less than the programmed
amounts, the ceiling will be raised pro tanto by the amount of the shortfalls up to the limit
(on a noncumulative basis) of CFAF 10 billion at end-September 2006, CFAF 18 billion at
end-December 2006. The amount of external budgetary assistance provided is calculated
from end-December 2004 onward. Budgetary assistance is defined as grants, loans, and debt
relief (excluding project loans and grants, IMF resources, and debt relief under the enhanced
Initiative for Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC Initiative)).
Performance criteria and indicators
8.
The ceiling on net domestic financing of the government is established as follows:
CFAF 4.7 billion at end-September 2006, and CFAF-38 billion at end December 2006. The
ceiling is an indicative target as at end-September 2006 and a performance criterion as at
end-December 2006.
Reporting requirement
9.
Detailed data on domestic financing to the government, including a detailed list of the
bank account balances of other public entities, will be transmitted on a monthly basis within
the four weeks following the end of the month. The definitive data will be provided within an
additional four weeks after the provisional data have been reported.
B. Narrow Primary Fiscal Balance
Definition
10.
The narrow primary fiscal balance is defined as the difference between total
budgetary revenues (tax and nontax) and the budgetary expenses, less interests on the debt
and capital expenditure financed by foreign grants and net loans.
Performance criterion
11.
The ceiling on the narrow primary fiscal balance is established as follows: a deficit
not higher than CFAF 19 billion at end-September 2006, and a deficit not higher than
CFAF 22.2 billion at end December 2006. The ceiling is an indicative target as at endSeptember 2006 and a performance criterion as at end-December 2006.

47
Reporting requirement
12.
Provisional data on the narrow primary fiscal balance, including the data generated by
the computerized budget management system (SIGFIP), will be transmitted on a monthly
basis within the four weeks following the end of the month. The definitive data will be
provided within an additional four weeks after the provisional data have been reported.
C. Accumulation of New Domestic Payments Arrears on Government Obligations
Definition
13.
Domestic payments arrears on government obligations are defined as outstanding
debt owed by the government to residents due following the expiration of a 60-day grace
period, unless specified otherwise, but not paid, and any financial obligation of the
government verified as such by the government (including any government debt). The Caisse
Autonome d’Amortissement (CAA-the government debt management agency) and the
Treasury keep and update the inventory of domestic debt arrears on government obligations
and maintain records of their payments.
Performance criterion
14.
The government undertakes not to accumulate any new domestic payments arrears on
government debt. For obligations other than government debt, the government undertakes not
to accumulate arrears beyond six months. The nonaccumulation of domestic payments
arrears will be monitored on a continuous basis throughout the program period.
Reporting requirement
15.
Data on outstanding balance, accumulation, and repayment of domestic payments
arrears on government obligations will be provided monthly within eight weeks following the
end of each month.
D. Nonaccumulation of External Public Payments Arrears
Definition
16.
External public payments arrears are defined as the sum of payments owed to non
residents due and not paid on debt of the government and on external debt guaranteed by the
government. The definition of “debt” provided in paragraph 3 applies here.
Performance criterion
17.
Under the program, the government will not accumulate external payments arrears,
with the exception of arrears arising from debt under renegotiation or being rescheduled. The

48
performance criterion on the nonaccumulation of external public payments arrears will be
monitored on a continuous basis throughout the program period.
E. Ceiling on Nonconcessional External Debt with a Maturity of One-Year
or More Newly Contracted or Guaranteed by the Government
Definition
18.
This performance criterion applies not only to debt as defined in point No. 9 of the
Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to Foreign Borrowing (Executive Board
Decision No. 6230-(79/140), amended by Executive Board Decision No. 12274-(00/85)
(8/24/00), but also to commitments contracted or guaranteed (including lease-purchase
agreements) for which no value has yet been received. The external debt excludes treasury
bills and bonds issued in CFAF on the regional financial market of the West African
Economic and Monetary Union.
19.
The concept of “government” for the purposes of this performance criterion includes
government as defined in paragraph 2, public institutions of an administrative nature (EPA),
public institutions of a scientific and/or technical nature, public institutions of a professional
nature, and local governments.
Performance criterion
20.
Nonconcessional external borrowing and guaranteeing will be zero throughout the
2006/07 program.
Reporting requirement
21.
Information on any borrowing (including terms of loans and creditors) contracted or
guaranteed by the government shall be transmitted each month within four weeks following
the end of the month.
F. Ceiling on Short-Term External Debt Newly Contracted
or Guaranteed by the Government
Definition
22.

The definitions in paragraphs 18 and 19 also apply to this performance criterion.

23.
Short-term external debt is debt with a contractual term of less than one year. Importrelated loans and debt-relief operations are excluded from this performance criterion.
Performance criterion
24.
In the context of the program, the government will not contract or guarantee shortterm nonconcessional external debt.

QUANTITATIVE INDICATORS

A. Floor on Government’s Revenues
Definition
26.
Government revenues are defined as those that appear in the government’s financial
operations table (TOFE).
Indicative targets
27.
Indicative targets for total government revenues are set at CFAF 286.9 billion at endSeptember 2006, and CFAF 410.4 at end-December 2006 (cumulative since end-December
2005).
Reporting requirement
28.
The government shall report its revenues to IMF staff each month in the context of
the TOFE and before the end of the following month.
B. Ceiling on the Wage Bill
Definition
29.
The wage bill includes all public expenditure on wages, bonuses, and other benefit or
allowances granted civil servants employed by the government, the military and other
security forces, and includes expenditure with respect to special contracts and other
permanent or temporary employment with the government. The wage bill, therefore,
excludes the salaries related to projects financed by foreign donors as well as the transfers
related to the salaries of the teachers at the level of local municipalities.
Indicative targets
30.
The quantitative benchmarks are defined as cumulative amounts after end-December
2004. The civil servant wage bill quarterly ceilings are CFAF 104 billion at end-September
2006, and CFAF 138.1 billion at end-December 2006.
Reporting requirement
31.
The government shall report the wage bill to IMF staff each month in the context of
the TOFE.

The Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) provides 100 percent debt relief to eligible member
countries that are qualified for the assistance. The debt relief covers the full stock of debt owed to the
Fund as of end-2004 which remains outstanding at the time the member qualifies for such debt relief.
The MDRI is financed by bilateral contributions and the Fund's own resources, as well as the resources
already disbursed to the member under the HIPC Initiative (see Section VII above).

_________________
Decision point - point at which the IMF and the World Bank determine whether a country
qualifies for assistance under the HIPC Initiative and decide on the amount of assistance to
be committed.
Interim assistance - amount disbursed to a country during the period between decision and
completion points, up to 20 percent annually and 60 percent in total of the assistance
committed at the decision point (or 25 percent and 75 percent, respectively, in exceptional
circumstances).
Completion point - point at which a country receives the remaining balance of its assistance
committed at the decision point, together with an additional disbursement of interest income
as defined in footnote 2 above. The timing of the completion point is linked to the
implementation of pre-agreed key structural reforms (i.e., floating completion point).

55
IX. Safeguards Assessments:
The Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) is the common central bank of the
countries of the West African Economic and Monetary Union. A safeguards assessment
completed on November 4, 2005 found that progress has been made in strengthening the
BCEAO’s safeguards framework since 2002 when the last safeguards assessment took place.
The BCEAO now publishes a full set of audited financial statements and improvements have
been made to move financial reporting closer to International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRS). Furthermore, an internal audit charter has been put in place and mechanisms have
been established to improve risk management and risk prevention, including a follow up on
internal and external audit recommendations.
The new assessment also identified a number of areas where further steps would help solidify
the progress made. The main recommendations relate to improvements in the external audit
process (including the adoption of a formal rotation policy), further enhancement of the
transparency of the financial statements by fully adopting IFRS, and strengthening of the
effectiveness of the internal audit function.
X.

Exchange Arrangement:

Benin is a member of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU). The
exchange system common to all member countries of the WAMU is free of restrictions on
payments and transfers for current international transactions subject to Fund jurisdiction. The
union’s common currency, the CFA franc, had been pegged to the French franc at the rate of
CFAF 1 = F 0.02. Effective January 12, 1994, the CFA franc was devalued, and the new
parity set at CFAF 1 = F 0.01. Effective January 1, 1999, the CFA franc was pegged to the
euro at a rate of EUR 1 = CFAF 655.957. As of end December 2005, the rate of the CFA
franc in terms of the SDR was SDR 1= CFAF 794.72.
XI.

Article IV Consultations:

The last Article IV consultation discussions were held in Cotonou during June 7-18, 2004.
The staff report (Country Report 04/368), together with selected issues and a statistical
appendix (Country Report 04/370), was discussed by the Executive Board, and the 2004
Article IV consultation was concluded on October 6, 2004.
XII.

ROSC Assessment:

An FAD mission conducted the fiscal module of a Report on Observance of Standards and
Codes (ROSC) in May 2001. The mission recommended the adoption of a three-year action
plan containing measures to improve expenditure management. The mission also identified a
list of actions to be taken quickly to ensure that the authorities were able to monitor budget

56
execution. The ROSC fiscal transparency module for Benin was circulated to the Board on
June 6, 2002 (Country Report 02/217).

Appendix III—Relations with the World Bank Group
Partnership in Benin’s development strategy
1.
Benin’s poverty reduction strategy paper (PRSP), finalized in December 2002, was
discussed at the Bank and Fund Boards in March 2003. The PRSP provides a framework for
aligning donor assistance programs, including those of the Bank and the Fund, with the
country’s poverty reduction efforts. Benin is now planning to prepare its second PRSP.
2.
The IMF has taken the lead in helping Benin maintain macroeconomic stability. In
that context, the three-year Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement,
which was approved in July 2005, addresses issues related to fiscal consolidation and
structural reforms that are key to maintaining macroeconomic stability and fostering growth.
The PRGF’s structural conditionality focused on the following areas: public expenditure
management, tax policy and administration, civil service reform, and the privatization
program.
3.
Public expenditure management reform has been an important focus of the Bank’s
assistance program. In close collaboration with the Fund and other donors, the Bank has
provided technical and financial assistance to the government’s reform efforts in this area.
The Bank has also been in the lead in helping Benin strengthen the provision of basic social
services, most importantly in the education and health sectors, pursuing a divestiture program
in the utility and infrastructure sectors, and enhancing the competitiveness of the cotton
sector.
IMF-World Bank collaboration in specific areas
4.
Common objectives and joint support for Benin’s PRSP and the Initiative for Heavily
Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC Initiative) processes have increased collaboration between
the Fund and Bank in recent years. The Bank and Fund teams are closely coordinating their
policy advice to the authorities. There is also close coordination in the determination of
structural conditionality
5.
In general, the Bank is leading the policy dialogue on key structural aspects of the
reform program, with a strong focus on public expenditure management. The Fund is in the
lead in the policy dialogue on macroeconomic issues, particularly fiscal elements of the
reform.
Areas in which the Bank leads
6.
Divestiture program and private sector development. The Bank has supported
Benin’s program for the divestiture of public enterprises through different projects. The
remaining enterprises to be privatized include the cotton parastatal, SONAPRA, and most
public utilities: the telecommunications company (OPT), the water and electricity

59
distribution company (SBEE), and the Autonomous Port of Cotonou (PAC). Assistance for
the privatization of the OPT and for improving the Cotonou port operations is provided
through the Private Sector Development Project. The Bank supports the privatization of the
electricity branch of the SBEE through the Energy Services Delivery Project which was
approved by the Bank’s Board on July 6, 2004. Successful completion of this privatization is
a condition for moving to the second phase of this project. The privatization of SONAPRA’s
ginning mills is supported by the Cotton Sector Project. The now closed Transportation
Sector Project assisted the government in designing a strategy to involve the private sector in
the management of the PAC. The Fund is involved in policy dialogue on these operations,
given the importance of the divestiture program to macroeconomic stability and growth.
7.
Service delivery reforms. Improving access to basic social services is one of the four
main strategic pillars of Benin’s PRSP, and the health and basic education sectors are among
the priority sectors that have received increased budget allocations in the medium term
expenditure framework (MTEF). The Bank supported reform programs in these sectors
through investment projects that were closed in the past three years. In line with the CAS
discussed at the Bank’s Board on July 3, 2003, the Bank is continuing to work closely with
the government on enhancing access to, and quality of, education and health care services
through policy dialogue and financial and technical assistance in the context of the Poverty
Reduction Support Credits (PRSCs). A number of key policy measures in these two sectors
have been implemented as conditions for reaching in March 2003 the enhanced HIPC
Initiative completion point, and the first and second PRSCs which were presented to the
Bank’s Board in March 2004 and June 2005, respectively. The Bank is also playing a lead
role in support of a multisector response to the HIV/AIDS pandemic, based on the
government’s comprehensive strategic framework covering 2000-05, adopted in December
2000. A follow-up project is under preparation for FY07 Board presentation.
8.
Poverty monitoring. The PRSP presents an action plan to establish a reliable
database for measuring income poverty in 2003 using a revised methodology. The Bank is
providing technical support for the implementation of this action plan and for other efforts
aimed at understanding the determinants of poverty in Benin. These include the poverty and
social impact analysis (PSIA) of cotton sector reform, which was prepared by IDA in
collaboration with the government, and the Poverty Assessment (PA), which was released in
June 2004.
9.
The Poverty Assessment was disseminated in conjunction with the PRSP in
December 2004 with the assistance of the Bank. The Bank is also advising the authorities, in
the context of the implementation of the PRSP, on strengthening institutional arrangements
for monitoring and evaluating poverty in the country.
10.
Cotton sector reforms. Cotton is Benin’s only major cash crop, and the sector has
accounted in recent years for around 80 percent of its export earnings. The cotton sector is a
key focus of the Bank’s assistance program. A comprehensive reform of this sector, aimed at

60
liberalizing and strengthening the capacity of producers has been undertaken since the early
1990s, with the support of the Bank and bilateral donors. Important progress has been
achieved so far, such as by eliminating the monopsony of the state enterprise (SONAPRA) in
cotton marketing, liberalizing input supply, and opening the sector to private ginners. In
2002, the Bank Board approved a Cotton Sector Reform Project, which is supporting the
consolidation of the reforms. The Bank is also helping the government to define the
regulatory framework for the sector which was adopted at end 2004.
Areas in which the Bank and Fund share the lead
11.
Public expenditure management reform. Through its Public Expenditure Reform
Adjustment Credit (PERAC) and related Supplemental Credit (now both closed), the Bank
played a lead role in assisting the authorities in putting in place a framework for a thorough
public expenditure management reform, which was launched in 2001. The PERAC aimed at
enhancing the effectiveness and poverty focus of public expenditure. As shown in the 2004
PER, the reform has achieved good progress so far, such as the finalization of an MTEF on
the basis of the PRSP, the completion of a performance-based budget cycle, an effective
delegation of spending authority to line ministries, and an introduction of a computerized
budget implementation system, as well as in the area of reporting on and auditing
government accounts. The Fund supported these reform efforts through a number of financial
and structural benchmarks in the PRGF management.
12.
Fiscal policy and fiduciary framework. Fiscal consolidation was a key objective of
the Fund-supported PRGF arrangement. The Bank is focusing on inter- and intrasector
allocations, in particular in the priority sectors covered by the PERAC and the future PRSCs
(education, health, water and sanitation, transportation, agriculture, forestry and
environment). These priority sectors have represented about 55 percent of total expenditure,
excluding debt service, in recent years. In addition, the Bank is helping to strengthen Benin’s
fiduciary framework through analytical and advisory activities (AAA), such as forthcoming
update of the Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR), the Country Financial
Accountability Assessment (CFAA), and the governance and anti-corruption survey. The
PRSC-2 supports a comprehensive action plan for public procurement reform that addresses
main weaknesses identified in the 1999 CPAR.
13.
Poverty reduction strategy. Together with other external development partners, the
Bank and Fund have jointly provided assistance to the government in the preparation of
Benin’s PRSP. The PRSP was discussed at Bank and Fund Boards in March 2003, together
with a joint staff assessment prepared by Bank and Fund staffs. Both institutions will
continue to jointly advise the authorities on the refinement, implementation, monitoring, and
evaluation of the strategy. Bank and Fund staffs also helped the government finalize its
second annual progress report of the poverty reduction strategy, formally transmitted in April
2005 and circulated to the Bank and Fund Boards in June 2005. The Bank supported the
government to prepare a detailed action plan for the dissemination of the PRSP. The

61
consultation program is designed to reach key line ministries within the government, the
National Assembly as well as the civil society and the private sector. (announce the
upcoming PRSP).
14.
Debt sustainability. The Bank and the Fund jointly supported the government’s
efforts to reach the HIPC Initiative completion point in March 2003. In the context of the
new PRGF program, Bank and Fund staffs updated the debt sustainability analysis for Benin,
in close collaboration with the authorities. To maintain debt sustainability after enhanced
HIPC Initiative relief, the authorities will need to pursue a prudent external financing policy.
The Bank and Fund intend to continue the dialogue with the government on this issue,
including through providing advice on the required strengthening of domestic capacities for
debt management.
15.
Civil service reform and devolution policy. The Bank provided in the past major
technical assistance for the design of the reform of the civil service promotion and
compensation system. Through its Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) and
subsequent PRGF, the Fund has included structural measures designed to implement this
reform. However, a key measure─the adoption of legislation regarding the new
compensation system for civil servants─has been stalled for several years. Another important
area of public sector reform is the devolution policy, which gained momentum following the
municipal elections held in December 2002. The Fund is monitoring closely the fiscal
implications of this policy. The Bank has recently conducted two pieces of analytical work
on public administration reform and decentralization as a basis for policy dialogue.
16.
Financial sector policy. The Fund has supported the government’s efforts to
strengthen Benin’s financial sector. These efforts have focused on ensuring that banks meet
the Regional Banking Commission’s prudential ratios. The reform of the financial sector also
includes the divestiture of the state-owned Continental Bank and the rehabilitation of
microfinance institutions. As part of the Private Sector Development Project, the Bank has
been providing support to two major microfinance institutions. A financial sector review was
completed and the report was released in July 2004.
Areas in which the Fund leads
17.
Macroeconomic stability. The medium-term objective of Benin’s macroeconomic
program is to achieve strong economic growth and reduce poverty, while maintaining
financial stability. The Fund has been supporting this program through its dialogue on
macroeconomic policy, technical assistance, and the PRGF framework.
18.
Tax and custom administration reforms. To enhance Benin’s fiscal revenues, the
Fund has provided technical assistance to help the authorities prepare and update action plans
aimed at improving the performance of the tax and customs administrations as well as
broadening the tax base.

62
World Bank strategy
19.
The overriding objective of the current Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)
discussed at its Board on July 3, 2003 is to help Benin reverse the recent trends of limited or
no poverty reduction amid relatively robust growth. Progress in reducing poverty and
attaining the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) requires further deepening of cotton
sector reforms, strengthening efforts toward diversifying the economy, making tangible
progress in the social sectors, building effective and responsive public institutions, promoting
gender equality, and strengthening collaboration with the private sector and civil society. The
CAS describes a program of financial assistance and nonlending services as the Bank’s
contribution to addressing these challenges. It supports the implementation and further
refinement of the PRSP, and it is aligned to the four PRSP pillars.1 A new CAS is scheduled
to be prepared in 2008 once the Government has finalized its PRSC.
20.
The CAS enforces the gradual shift of the Bank’s lending program toward
programmatic lending, as initiated under the interim CAS (I-CAS) approved in January 2001
and in response to the PRSP’s explicit invitation to donors to do more in that area. Building
on the PERAC, the Bank expects this shift to enhance the development impact of its
assistance to Benin by fostering national leadership of development programs. It has also
facilitated donor coordination around Benin’s PRSP. This will require, however, a continued
strong commitment to advance public sector management reforms aimed at increasing
efficiency in the use of public resources. To address these transitional challenges, the Bank
will continue its support of Benin’s public expenditure reform through financial and technical
support. Annual single-tranche PRSCs are envisaged to remain a key vehicle for Bank
support to the country. A first PRSC was presented to the Bank’s Board in March 2004, and
the second PRSC, presented to the Bank’s Board in June 2005, will continue to support the
PRSP pillars, with components on macroeconomic stability, service delivery, and
governance.

1

The four pillars to effective poverty reduction are the following: (i) the strengthening of the mediumterm macroeconomic framework; (ii) human development and environmental management, including
improving the access of the poor to quality basic services (basic education, primary health care, water
and sanitation, food security and nutrition, adequate habitat, and rural roads); (iii) improvement of
governance and institutional reforms, such as decentralization, public administration reform, and
strengthening of the legal and judicial system; and (iv) improvement of employment or incomegenerating opportunities for the poor, and the strengthening of their capacity to participate in decision
making and production.

The PRSP preparation process has fostered collaboration between the Bank and other
development partners, including civil society organizations. Donors have signaled their
willingness to align their assistance programs to the PRSP and some of them (the European
Union, the African Development Bank, Switzerland, Denmark, and the Netherlands) have
engaged in budget support operations, in close coordination with the Bank’s PRSC
preparation process.
22.
As of June 28, 2006, the Bank lending portfolio consisted of seven operations, with a
net commitment of US$232.4 million and an undisbursed balance of US$168.8 million (see
table above). The CAS has a determined lending volume for the period FY04 - FY06
amounting to US$200 million. As discussed previously, a large part of IDA financing
(US$85 million) has been channeled through PRSCs. As indicated in the CAS, a key
objective of the Bank’s nonlending program is to help the government strengthen its sectorwide expenditure programs as a basis for consolidating programmatic support and building
the capacity required for preparing, implementing, and monitoring these programs.

Appendix IV—Debt Sustainability Analysis1
Although Benin’s external debt ratios under the baseline scenario are projected to remain
below the relevant indicative debt burden thresholds, the possibility of slower-than-projected
growth, volatile export prices and output, and new nonconcessional borrowing could lead to
a breach of the policy-based indicative thresholds, placing the country at a moderate risk of
debt distress. Thus, as new borrowing space opens up in the post-MDRI era, staff
recommends that the future borrowing program be assessed with due caution, with special
consideration given to the concessionality of new loans, cost-benefit analyses of investment
projects, and the assessment of the absorptive capacity of the economy.
A.

Introduction

Benin’s risk of debt distress is moderate based on the path of external debt burden
indicators under alternative scenarios and stress tests. The external debt burden indicators
do not breach the relevant policy-dependent indicative thresholds2 under the baseline
scenario, but are substantially above the thresholds under standard alternative scenarios and
some boundary tests. These findings are in line with Benin’s previous DSA, which flagged
the possibility of debt levels exceeding indicative thresholds under stress tests and alternative

Benin’s debt has declined gradually since 2001. The outstanding stock of debt decreased
from about 59 percent of GDP at end-2001 to 42 percent in 2003, the year the country
reached the completion point under the enhanced HIPC Initiative.4 By 2006, the nominal

The low income country debt sustainability framework (LIC DSF) provides indicative levels
(thresholds) of debt burdens beyond which a country’s risk of debt distress reaches levels that are
considered unacceptable. The LIC DSF recognizes that better policies and institutions allow
countries to manage higher levels of debt, and thus the threshold levels are policy-dependent. Benin’s
policies and institutions, as measured by the World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional
Assessment (CPIA), place it as a “medium performer”. The relevant indicative thresholds for this
category are indicated in Text table 1 below.

The last DSA for Benin was conducted in August 2005. See IMF Country Report No. 05/288,
Section IV.

Benin reached the enhanced HIPC Initiative completion point in March 2003 (see “Benin –
Enhanced initiative for Heavily Indebted Poor Countries – Completion Point Document;” Country
Report 03/189).

65
debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to decline further to 12.7 percent, reflecting total debt
cancellation under the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI).5
The present debt sustainability analysis (DSA) is based on the full implementation of
MDRI. In 2006–11, the projected share of loan disbursements from multilateral creditors is
assumed to stay at its post-MDRI level as at end-2006 in part reflecting the impact of IDA
and AfDF “moderate” lending policies to MDRI countries in the post-MDRI period. Beyond
2011, multilateral debt as a share of total debt is assumed to increase steadily.6
Although Benin’s external debt burden indicators do not breach the indicative
thresholds under the baseline scenario, vulnerabilities associated with slower growth,
adverse exogenous shocks, or decreased availability of concessional financing point to a
moderate risk of debt distress. This situation underscores the need to preserve
macroeconomic stability and deepen structural reforms with a view to maintaining the
economy on a path of sustained growth.
Going forward, a prudent borrowing strategy would help the country maintain its risk
of debt distress within acceptable limits. Such a strategy, built on appropriate
concessionality of new loans, cost-benefit analyses of investment projects, and assessment of
the absorptive capacity constraints of the economy, would help prevent a rapid reaccumulation of new debt.
The rest of the analysis is organized as follows: Section B spells out the baseline scenario;
Section C discusses alternative scenarios and stress tests; and Section D further highlights the
positive impact of the MDRI on Benin’s debt dynamics and provides staff recommendations.

5

The MDRI cut-off dates for the IMF and the African Development Fund debt (AfDF) is end-2004
and that for International Development Association (IDA) credits is end-2003. Without MDRI, that
ratio would have been 36.2 percent by end-2006.
6

MDRI (but not HIPC) debt relief entails a (less than proportional) reduction in the allocation of
resources from IDA and the AfDB to the recipient countries. At end 2005, multilateral debt after
HIPC represented 95 percent of Benin’s total debt; that share declined to 84 percent after the MDRI.
The IDA debt ratio was 48 percent pre-MDRI and about 18 percent post-MDRI.

B.

Baseline Scenario: 2006–267

The macroeconomic projections for 2006–26, built around Benin’s existing short-run
structural capacity constraints, assume the implementation of growth-enhancing
structural policies in the medium and long term (See Box 1) 8. Assuming the
government’s sustained implementation of reforms to diversify the economy and increase its
resilience to adverse shocks, average real GDP growth is projected at 5.3 percent and 5.5
percent in 2006-11, and 2012-26, respectively, from a historical average of 4.2 percent
during 2000-05. The period 2000-05 is the historical basis for the projections.
Growth is projected to be initially driven primarily by the cotton and service sectors.
Seed cotton output is projected to reach full capacity of 600,000 tons for cotton-ginning
plants by 2026, as the GDP share of other sector rises. Consumer price inflation is expected
to be in line with the relevant West African Economic and Monetary Union convergence
criterion, remaining at about 2.5 percent through 2026, below the historical average of 3.4
percent.
The baseline scenario underscores the importance of enhancing fiscal discipline. On
average, the overall fiscal deficit, excluding grants, is projected to be below 5 percent of
GDP in 2006–26, with revenue rising to a projected 20 percent of GDP and total expenditure
expected to reach the equivalent of 25 percent of GDP, on average, in the period. Total
expenditure is projected to increase gradually in the initial period, from 21 percent in 2005 to
26 percent in 2011, reflecting an expected higher investment budget, particularly for
infrastructure projects, to sustain future growth. The financing gap is assumed to average 3
percent per annum, increasing gradually, from less than 2 percent of GDP in 2006 to about 4
percent of GDP in 2011. Beyond 2011, the financing gap is expected to decline steadily,
falling below 1 percent in 2026.
The baseline scenario also stresses the importance of fostering a business environment
that attracts foreign direct investment. GDP and export growth beyond the cotton sector
will depend on continued capital accumulation that requires substantial increases in FDI from
a historical average of 1.5 percent of GDP to 3.9 percent of GDP. Financing new investments
with loans, particularly nonconcessional borrowing, can lead to a quick deterioration of
Benin’s debt ratios.

7

The DSA exercise focuses on external debt as the stock of domestic debt is projected to remain
below 2.5 percent of GDP on average in 2006-26.

8

The updated DSA includes minor changes in macroeconomic assumptions and in new borrowing
conditions from the 2005 DSA (IMF Country Report No. 05/288). In particular, the previous DSA
assumed interest rate, grace period, and maturity of 1.9 percent, 7.7 years, and 28 years, respectively
(See Box 1). In addition, based on historical structure, we assumed that 53 percent of the financing

gap will be covered by external creditors.

67

Box 1. Benin: Baseline Scenario - Macroeconomic Assumptions for 2006–26
•

Real GDP is projected to rise by 5.3 percent annually in 2006 –11 and by 5.5 percent annually
in 2012–26, from an historical average growth of 4.2 percent in 2000-05, reflecting the
implementation of growth-supporting policies and private sector involvement.

•

In 2006-11, real GDP growth is is expected to be based on growth in the cotton and service
sectors. Beyond 2011, economic diversification is projected to gradually take hold, as a result
of which non-cotton activity would account for an increasing share of growth performance. In
particular, the service sector, which currently accounts for about 40 percent of GDP, is
expected to expand rapidly as structural reforms take hold.

•

After a projected average increase of 13 percent during 2006–11, the growth of cotton
production is projected to decelerate steadily to an annual average of 0.6 percent in 2012–
2026. Cotton production is expected to reach full capacity (i.e. 600, 000 tons) by 2026;
however, improvements in cotton production efficiency would enhance productivity in the
latter years.

•

Inflation as measured by the consumer price index is projected to average 2.5 percent
annually in 2006–26.

•

Fiscal. The fiscal deficit, excluding grants, is projected to be below 5 percent of GDP. The
projected public financing gap is within 2–4 percent of GDP. The grant share is assumed to be
maintained at the historical level of about 47 percent.

•

External sector. Over the medium term, the terms of trade are assumed to improve on
average by 4.2 percent annually, and the current account deficit is projected to remain below 5
percent of GDP on average.
•

The volume of exports of goods and nonfactor services is expected to grow by about
9 percent a year, in line with projected cotton and noncotton production.

•

The volume of imports is projected to rise 10.3 percent annually in 2006–2026,
reflecting the projected average change in yearly gross domestic expenditure.
Therefore, its average (nominal) shares to GDP and domestic expenditure are
expected to increase gradually from respectively 26 percent and 23 percent in 200005 to 30 percent and 25 by 2026.

•

A large fraction of import growth is expected to be in capital goods; a meaningful
share of such imports is projected to be financed by FDI, which is forecast to average
3.9 percent of GDP in the projection period compared with the 2000-05 historical
high of 3.2 percent in 2000 and low of 0.9 percent in 2003.

Public debt and outcomes. New public external borrowing averages about 2 percent of GDP a year.
New loans have a projected average maturity of 26 years, a grace period of 8 years, and an average
interest rate of 2 percent. Average discount rate of 5 percent is built into the net present value
calculations, yielding an average grant element on new loans of about 32 percent.

68

Benin’s external debt burden indicators do not breach the relevant policy-dependent
indicative thresholds at any time under the baseline scenario (see Text Table 1). The
NPV of debt to GDP ratio is expected to stabilize at approximately 15 percent of GDP,
compared to a threshold of 40 percent. The NPV of debt to exports ratio is projected to reach
99 percent in 2016, a level that poses low risks of debt distress provided Benin’s policy
performance remains solid. Finally, the debt service ratio is expected to remain well below
the 20 percent threshold throughout the projection period under the baseline.

Alternative Scenarios and Stress Tests

Alternative scenarios and bound tests reveal moderate risk of debt distress. For instance,
the net present value of the debt-to-exports ratio could breach the policy-dependent indicative
threshold after 2011 under the historical scenario and, to a lesser degree, under the scenario
of increased nonconcessional borrowing. The NPV of debt to GDP ratio would also breach
the indicative threshold in the historical scenario.

69
Alternative scenarios show that Benin’s debt profile is vulnerable to nonconcessional
borrowing as well as growth rates and current account deficits at historical levels. The
alternative scenarios assume the following risks (i) a historical performance in economic
growth, FDI and the current account, reflecting lags in implementing reforms;9 (ii) new
borrowing on nonconcessional terms; and (iii) a weaker cotton production owing to poor
rainfall. The NPV of debt-to-exports ratio and debt service ratio breach the indicative
thresholds in the case of the first two shocks, and all relevant debt ratios deteriorate under the
historical and lower cotton output scenarios, reflecting cotton’s significant share in total
exports (Text Table 2).

(iii) grace period : 1 year, (iv) discount factor: 10 %

The substantial deterioration of debt ratios under the historical scenario stresses the
importance of FDI-financed investments to promote export growth beyond 2011.
Replacing FDI inflows with loans as a means of financing investment in imported capital
goods would substantially increase the risk of debt distress, particularly if loans are
contracted on non-concessional terms. An acceleration of export growth is also necessary to
relieve the pressure from underlying current account financing needs.
______________
9

The historical scenario assumes continuation of the historical 2000–05 growth performance of 4.2
percent, on average, in 2006–26, as opposed to the 5.5 percent average real GDP growth assumed in
the baseline scenario. Moreover, the historical scenario assumes a higher current account deficit (6.9
percent vs. 4.4 percent of GDP, on average) and lower FDI inflows (1.5 percent vs. 3.9 percent of
GDP, on average).

70
Benin’s debt indicators are also vulnerable to exogenous shocks, particularly shocks to
export growth. As summarized in Table 2, the NPV of debt-to-exports ratio would rise
quickly and exceed the policy-dependent threshold under a temporary shock to export
growth. Moreover, a combination of shocks to GDP growth and non-debt creating financing
flows (such as FDI) would also lead to an elevation of the risk of debt distress.
D.

Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative

MDRI-related debt relief has significantly reduced debt-service ratios. The 2006 debt
service–to-export ratio fell from 12 percent after HIPC relief and before MDRI assistance, to
5 percent after MDRI delivery. Excluding both HIPC and MDRI relief, that ratio would have
been about 18 percent. Continued reduction to Benin’s risk of debt distress post-MDRI will
depend on two major policy determinants: (i) new borrowing behavior; and (ii) authorities’
effectiveness both in using resources freed up by HIPC and MDRI to meet development
challenges as well as in attracting additional aid and investments through a strong policy and
institutional environment.
The projected post-MDRI debt
service ratio is more than halved
in the medium term. Beyond 2011
the ratio is projected to increase
steadily as the country contracts new
debt, but the ratio remains below the
indicative threshold (Figure 1).
Upon receiving debt relief under
the MDRI, Benin had seen its
borrowing capacity open up and
realized average debt service
savings of about US$64 million,10
or 1.3 percent of GDP, a year. In
allocating MDRI-and HIPC-related
debt-service savings, the government
aims to scale up pro-growth and propoor expenditure to accelerate
progress toward the Millennium
Development Goals.11

Including new borrowing and controlling for both estimated amounts and the distribution of
compensatory financing from IDA and AfDF relative to debt-service payments.

Chapter II of the Selected Issues paper elaborates on this issue.

71
In the period ahead, staff recommends that the authorities maintain prudent borrowing
strategy that includes: i) maximizing the use of concessional financing and grants; and
ii) integrating rigorous cost-benefit analysis of new projects, particularly those that are
financed with new debt, including considerations of the absorptive capacity of the
economy. The authorities ought to ensure that resources freed up by HIPC and MDRI, as
well as new grants from development partners, are not used to support new nonconcessional
borrowing but rather pro-poor and pro-growth spending. Moreover, given the moderate risk
identified in this DSA, debt-financed projects must be thoroughly scrutinized to ensure that
their expected returns justify not only the financing costs but also the additional risks to
Benin’s debt profile. Effective implementation of such a borrowing strategy would benefit
from close collaboration with and technical assistance from Benin’s development partners,
especially the World Bank.

Appendix V—Benin: Statistical Issues
(As of end-September 2006)
1.
Benin’s economic database is broadly adequate for both program monitoring and
surveillance, and, the common indicators required for surveillance are generally provided to
the Fund on a timely basis. However, there are weaknesses in the areas of national accounts,
public finance, monetary statistics, and balance of payments. In January 2001, the authorities
adopted the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) as the framework for the
development of the national statistical system; sectoral metadata, which were initially posted
on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board in September 2001, are due to be
updated. As a follow-up to GDDS participation, STA technical assistance (funded by the
Japanese government) is being offered to the eight member countries of the West African
Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) to assist with implementation of plans for the
improvement of their statistical systems. A Fund regional statistical advisor initiated a
program of assistance in government finance statistics, which is now managed by the West
Africa Regional Technical Assistance Center (AFRITAC West). A real sector statistics
improvement program, conducted in collaboration with the regional statistical office
AFRISTAT and initiated in May 2002, is currently being implemented.
Real sector statistics
2.
National statistics agencies were represented at two GDDS seminars: Yaoundé,
October 1998; and, Bamako, April 2001. As a follow-up to the Bamako workshop,
significant steps have been initiated to upgrade the national income accounting system based
on the System of National Accounts 1968 (1968 SNA). Benin also participates in WAEMU’s
harmonization of statistical methodologies through the multilateral surveillance process,
currently seeking regional improvements in the area of national accounts. In 2003, the
National Statistics Institute (INSAE) undertook the necessary steps to change the base year
for the accounting of the agricultural output and to include the consumption of fixed capital
assets in the public administration accounts. Under the GDDS project for the AFRITAC
West countries, a statistical register and an industrial production index are being developed,
and a series of missions are scheduled to assist in the implementation of the 1993 SNA.
3.
Consumer prices for Benin are measured using the WAEMU harmonized consumer
price index.
Government finance statistics
4.
Monthly government finance statistics are compiled by the Ministry of Finance with a
one- to three-month lag, based on information provided by the budget, customs, tax, and
treasury directorates. The Ministry of Finance prepares a monthly reconciliation of spending
commitments made by the budget directorate and payments made by the treasury. However,
no final budget or treasury accounts are published at the end of the fiscal year. Recently,

76
Benin provided 2005 data for publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook
(GFSY). No data are reported for publication in International Financial Statistics (IFS)
Monetary and financial statistics
5.
Monetary and financial statistics are compiled and disseminated by the regional
Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO). Difficulties experienced by the BCEAO in
estimating currency in circulation for the individual member countries, partly because of
delays in processing cash in its vaults, prompted AFR and STA to draft a joint letter to the
Governor of the BCEAO requesting an analysis of the developments in currency-incirculation and net foreign assets, and a description of measures being undertaken to improve
the situation. In response, the BCEAO made substantial revisions in 2005 to the estimates of
banknotes in circulation in member states resulting from cross-border banknote movement.
These revisions were due to changes in the method to estimate currency in circulation in the
WAEMU countries. The revised method, based on updated sorting coefficients (initially
established in 1990), has been applied retroactively from December 2003. The BCEAO is
using sorting coefficients to evaluate the amounts of currency issued by each country, which
in turn, are used to estimate currency in circulation and to adjust the net foreign assets of
each member country.
6.
A monetary and financial statistics mission visited the BCEAO headquarters in Dakar
in May 2001, and STA participated in a BCEAO-sponsored seminar on monetary statistics in
April 2003. In these regional forums, STA reviewed with the BCEAO representatives
outstanding methodological issues that concern the member countries of the WAEMU and
discussed the BCEAO’s plans to adopt the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual
(MFSM).
7.
In August 2006, as part of the authorities’ efforts to implement the MFSM’s
methodology, the BCEAO reported to STA monetary data for June 2006 for all member
countries using Standardized Report Forms (1SR-central bank, 2SR-other depository
corporations, and 5SR-monetary aggregates). The data are being reviewed in STA.
Balance of payments
8.
Since December 1998, the responsibility for compiling and disseminating balance of
payments statistics has been formally assigned to the BCEAO by area-wide legislation
adopted by the countries participating in the WAEMU. The national agency of the BCEAO
in Cotonou is responsible for compiling and disseminating Benin’s balance of payments
statistics, and the BCEAO headquarters in Dakar for delineating the methodology and
calculating the international reserves managed on behalf of the participating countries.
9.
Data consistency has significantly improved over the past few years, with a full
transition to the Balance of Payments Manual, Fifth Edition (BPM5). The BCEAO national
agency disseminates balance of payments statistics with a seven month lag, exceeding GDDS

77
guidelines. The BCEAO also compiles and disseminates the annual data of the international
investment position data with an 18-month lag.
10.
Regarding trade data, the ASYCUDA 1customs computer system is now installed in
all main border customs houses; ASYCUDA ++ is installed in the port and at the airport. The
interconnection between the computer systems of the main departments of Customs has not
been completed yet and the monitoring of import data needs to be stepped up.
11.
Further improvement in the data for services and transfers (especially workers’
remittances) will depend on the intensification of the contacts with reporting bodies. The
authorities’ commitment to strengthen the human and technical resources should be
enhanced.
12.
Concerning the financial account, the foreign assets of the private nonbanking sector
are still not well covered, especially the assets of WAEMU residents, which are obtained
through partial surveys of residents’ foreign assets. The organization of an exhaustive annual
survey of foreign direct investment transactions is still at a very preliminary stage. The
BCEAO has recently updated the compilation of commercial bank data on payments
involving nonresidents; however these data are not used to produce annual balance of
payments estimates, but rather to assess existing information.
13.
A technical assistance mission on balance of payments statistics visited Cotonou
November 11-23, 2004. Key findings were that human resources devoted to balance of
payments statistics by the national agency of the BCEAO are insufficient, but that the
reporting system was well developed and consistent. Regarding trade in goods, and the
recording of informal transactions, the statistical adjustments to Customs data appear
methodologically sound; however, the hypotheses and reference bases on which they rest are
largely untested. Other weaknesses in the current account concern the underestimation of
transportation services and overestimation of current transfers. In the financial account, the
coverage of direct investment is poor while unsorted banknotes impacts on the compilation
of net external assets in the balance of payments and international investment position
statistics.

The ASYCUDA (or SYDONIA, in French) software, sponsored by the United Nations Conference
on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and by donor countries, has already been implemented in
many countries. Freely available to customs administration, it is provided together with appropriate
staff-training schemes.

78
Poverty data
14.
Major methodological weaknesses remain regarding poverty data. In particular, the
methodology used in the household surveys raises concerns about the treatment of the
nonfood expenditure share in the calculation of the poverty line, the division of Benin into 12
agro-ecological zones, and the comparability of poverty statistics across urban and rural areas
and across time. The authorities are implementing an action plan to address these
methodological issues. The authorities have completed a modular survey of household living
conditions to update the poverty profile in the context of the preparation of the second PRSP.
External debt
15.
The Caisse Autonome d'Amortissements (CAA) is responsible for signing
international loan agreements, maintaining the debt database, and servicing the government's
external debt obligations. Since 1995, the CAA has been using the Commonwealth
Secretariat Debt Recording and Management System (CS-DRMS) to record and manage the
debt. For the majority of creditors, the CAA's database is fairly comprehensive and up-todate, and contains accurate stock data, as well as projected debt-service flows, on a loan-byloan basis. For a small number of creditors, however, regular statements are not received.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
December 12, 2006

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2006 Article IV Consultation with Benin
On November 27, 2006, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Benin.1
Background
Economic performance has been relatively subdued since 2003 after a decade of high growth.
Slow economic growth has reflected limited progress in addressing core economic
vulnerabilities and delays in implementing crucial growth-supporting structural reforms, against
a backdrop of an appreciating real effective exchange rate and, more recently, a sizable
deterioration in the terms of trade. Real GDP growth fell to 2.9 percent in 2005 largely because
of weakness in the cotton sector, which contributes an estimated 10 percent to total value
added, and because investment demand was affected by election-related uncertainties. Inflation
spiked upwards owing to strong food demand from crisis-afflicted Niger and high oil prices.
Benin has lost over 60 percent of competitiveness gains from the 1994 devaluation of the CFA
franc—more than in most other West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU)
countries. The real effective exchange rate appreciated by another 2 percent in 2005 due to
unfavorable price developments. Moreover, as world oil prices surged and the f.o.b. price for
ginned cotton declined 35 percent, the terms of trade deteriorated by about 16 percent in 2005.
Nonetheless, the current account deficit, excluding grants, continued to moderate, reflecting
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2

lower formal sector oil imports stemming from management weaknesses at SONACOP (Benin’s
oil-importing monopoly) and weaker capital goods imports.
Notwithstanding further delays in structural reforms, a turnaround in cotton production is helping
to revive growth in 2006. Growth is also benefiting from Port of Cotonou reforms and ongoing
improvements in trade relations with Nigeria. Real GDP growth is expected to rebound to 4.5
percent in 2006. Inflation is projected to ease to 2½ percent by end-2006 and the current
account deficit (excluding official grants) is expected to decline further to 7 percent of GDP.
The narrowly defined primary budget deficit is projected to meet the program target of
0.4 percent of GDP (0.9 percent, including Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative-funded outlays) in
2006. Fiscal prospects have benefited from expenditure and revenue measures introduced in
the second quarter of 2006. These measures include the institution of a treasury committee to
monitor more closely revenue collection and spending execution under the supervision of the
finance minister, and strict adherence to expenditure execution procedures. With technical
assistance from the World Bank, the new administration has initiated an audit of the new
domestic payments arrears that came to light in 2006; the audit report and a plan to settle
certified arrears are to be completed by end-2006.
Broad money rose by over 22 percent in 2005, considerably more than nominal GDP. In
response, the BCEAO increased the reserve requirement ratio in Benin by 400 basis points, to
15 percent, in mid-2005, the highest level in the WAEMU. Broad money and private sector
credit growth has subsequently eased and is projected to slow to a pace closer to trend in 2006.
In 2006, Benin received debt relief of US$1.112 billion (25 percent of 2005 GDP) under the
Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative; this has reduced the country’s total external public debt to
about 13 percent of GDP. The assistance will partly be allocated to priority sector spending in
education, health, and infrastructure.
Over the medium term, the government’s economic policies aim to accelerate growth while
keeping inflation low. Assuming a favorable external environment and a continuing recovery of
cotton production, the medium-term macroeconomic framework calls for annual real GDP
growth of 4½-5½ percent in 2006–08, in line with performance before Benin’s recent slowdown.
Inflation is expected to be contained within the WAEMU limit of 3 percent, which would prevent
further real exchange rate appreciation, while the external current account deficit narrows to
6.5 percent of GDP by 2008. The narrowly defined primary budget deficit (including MDRIfunded outlays) would be eliminated in 2008.
A key element of the authorities’ structural reform agenda is to reinvigorate stalled privatization
of the utilities, port, and cotton sectors. Under the cabinet-approved disengagement strategies,
the government would: (i) complete its withdrawal from commercial activities in the cotton sector
by mid-2007; (ii) bring to point of sale the state-owned electricity company by the end of August
2007; and (iii) start operations of the consolidated electronic billing system at the Port of

3

Cotonou’s centralized clearing and invoicing management center by the end of December 2006.
The authorities also intend to bring the telecommunications company to the point of sale before
end-January 2009. A revised Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) that places a renewed
emphasis on private sector-led economic growth is to be completed in December 2006.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the rebound in growth in 2006, which in part reflects a recovery
in cotton output. Directors commended the adoption of a growth strategy by Benin’s authorities
that aims at strengthening the fiscal position and rekindling structural reforms. They stressed
the importance of addressing core economic vulnerabilities to accelerate growth, reduce
poverty, and help achieve Benin’s Millennium Development Goals. Structural reforms will also
be essential to counter the long-term decline in competitiveness and overcome absorptive and
institutional capacity constraints. Directors also encouraged the authorities to seek concessional
financing from development partners for their economic program.
Directors stressed that long-term fiscal sustainability is crucial to sustained economic growth
and poverty reduction. They commended the authorities for measures taken to reverse recent
fiscal slippages and emphasized the importance of adherence to the convergence criteria under
the Growth and Stability Pact in the West African Economic and Monetary Union.
Looking ahead, Directors were encouraged by the government’s commitment to improving
revenue and expenditure administration, which they considered essential to achieving fiscal
consolidation and providing space for increased pro-poor spending. They underscored the need
to strengthen revenue performance through improved tax and customs administration and
urged the authorities to implement the recommendations of recent Fund technical assistance on
revenue management. Directors underscored the need for strict observance of expenditure
execution procedures. They also noted the envisaged orderly settlement of overdue obligations
to civil servants and stressed that this, together with appropriate containment of the wage bill,
was essential to provide space for priority spending. Directors took note of the authorities’
efforts to restore the medium-term financial viability of the civil service pension fund, but
regretted the lack of visible progress so far. They commended the authorities for their
implementation of the April 2006 ban on the use of ad-hoc Treasury Payments Orders, which
had boosted extra-budgetary outlays in the past, and encouraged the authorities to enhance
public expenditure management, especially as regards expenditure tracking.
Directors noted that Benin’s financial system appears mostly sound and welcomed the
completion of reforms to address governance and portfolio weaknesses in some banks.
However, they recommended continued efforts to reduce nonperforming loans and vigilance to
avoid the risks related to the substantial loan concentration in a limited number of sectors and
companies.

4

Directors cautioned against a borrowing policy that would put external debt sustainability at risk
in the post-MDRI era. Directors advised that, as new borrowing space opens up, particular
attention be given to the concessionality of new loans, cost-benefit analyses of envisaged
investment projects, and appropriate assessment of the absorptive capacity of the economy. In
this context, Directors regretted that the outgoing administration had gone against the advice of
its debt committee and guaranteed a non-concessional loan to the state-owned telephone
company.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ renewed commitment to enhancing external
competitiveness through reforms in the parastatal sectors. They emphasized the crucial
importance of bolstering the viability of Benin’s cotton sector, and welcomed the announced
government withdrawal from industrial and commercial activities in the sector by mid-2007.
Directors stressed the need for an adequate regulatory framework in the energy sector to
encourage private sector involvement. They expressed concern about the slow pace of reforms
in the telecommunications sector, and welcomed the announced strategic assessment of the
telecom parastatal in preparation for its privatization.
Directors strongly encouraged the authorities to pursue reforms aimed at addressing
weaknesses in the judicial system, modernizing land tenure, and facilitating access to credit for
small and medium sized enterprises.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's views and
analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country (or countries) concerned,
PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations with member countries, of its
surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program monitoring, and of ex post assessments of
member countries with longer-term program engagements. PINs are also issued after Executive Board
discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Completes First Review Under Benin’s PRGF Arrangement
and Approves US$1.3 Million Disbursement
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today completed the first review
of Benin's economic performance under an SDR 6.19 million (about US$9.3 million) Poverty
Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF)1 arrangement (see Press Release No. 05/190), and
approved the disbursement of an amount equivalent to SDR 880,000 million (about
US$1.3 million).
Conclusion of the first review had been delayed due to a lack of progress on cotton and public
utility sectors reform in the run-up to the recent presidential election. The Board waived Benin’s
non-observance of the performance criteria concerning the accumulation of new domestic
payment arrears and the non- contracting or guaranteeing of nonconcessional external debt with
maturities of one year or more.
Benin reached the completion point under the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC)
Initiative in March 2003, receiving total debt relief of about US$265 million. In January 2006,
Benin received debt relief under the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative from the IMF in the
amount of SDR 36.1 million (about US$54 million).
Following the Executive Board's discussion of Benin, Mr. John Lipsky, First Deputy Managing
Director and Acting Chair, stated:
“The authorities have adopted a growth-enhancing strategy that is supported by the Poverty
Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF). The authorities’ strategy seeks to achieve strong and
sustained growth and addressing vulnerabilities to exogenous shocks, and will be crucial to
reducing poverty and facilitating progress toward achieving Benin’s Millennium Development
Goals.
“Fiscal consolidation is a key pillar of the authorities’ growth strategy. The authorities will
enhance fiscal revenue through improved tax and customs administration, while strengthening

expenditure management and carefully limiting the public sector wage bill. The savings
generated through these efforts, combined with the fiscal space from the debt relief will bolster
pro-growth and pro-poor spending. Further strengthening public expenditure management to
enhance transparency and improve governance in public finances will also be essential. To
preserve fiscal and debt sustainability over time the authorities will need to seek external
assistance on highly concessional terms for the ambitious infrastructure rehabilitation program.
“On the structural front, the authorities’ will advance the privatization agenda to support private
sector development and foster production and export diversification. In this respect, the
authorities intend to withdraw from industrial and commercial activities in the cotton and
electricity sectors, expedite plans for privatizing Benin Telecom, and intensify ongoing efforts to
improve the competitiveness of the port of Cotonou. Other key areas of structural reform include
the judicial and land tenure systems, not least to support efforts to facilitate access to credit for
small- and medium-sized businesses,” Mr. Lipsky said.

Statement by Laurean W. Rutayisire, Executive Director for Benin
November 27, 2006

On behalf of my Beninese authorities, I would like to thank the staff for the constructive
policy discussions held in Cotonou and the well-written set of papers. My beninese
authorities fully appreciate the continuous financial and technical assistance they have
received from the Fund over the years.
Despite subdued economic performance in recent years, growth has been revived owing to a
recovering cotton sector which contributed about 10 percent to total value added, employs a
significant portion of Benin’s labor force and touches 40 percent of its population. The
economic slump experienced by Benin in the recent past owes mostly to exogenous shocks
associated with large terms of trade declines which stem from falling world cotton prices and
escalating petroleum product prices. In spite of these adverse developments, the authorities
are determined to adopt policy measures aimed at rebounding the economy, notably
strengthening of macroeconomic stability through tightening the fiscal stance and
reingovirating the structural reform agenda in the energy, telecommunications and cotton
ginning sectors. The strength of the financial sector, which has grown and is made up of
banks that meet key prudential norms, will be a key component of the growth and
development strategy of the country. Over the period leading up to 2008, my authorities also
envisage to rehabilitate economic and social infrastructure as well as improve the business
climate through reforms of the judicial and land tenure systems and greater access to credit
for small and medium-sized enterprises.
Thanks to appreciable good governance, the authorities of Benin will benefit from resources
from the Millennium Challenge Account, which will help finance these important reforms.
Another milestone in the country’s path to solid growth and development is the smooth
political and social processes carried out since the early 1990s. Benin held successfully
presidential elections earlier this year, confirming the progressive deepening of democratic
institutions in this country. These efforts to strengthen democratic progress have absorbed
significant financial resources, as has the support to the critical cotton sector.
Aware of the main challenges facing the Beninese economy, the newly elected
administration has expressed a strong commitment to reforms, with great emphasis on fiscal
discipline and privatization of state-owned companies. In this regard, my authorities have
taken some remedial actions aimed at keeping the current PRGF program on track, notably
reduction in customs exemptions to boost revenues, decisive government efforts to clear
potential arrears in the first half of 2006, intensification of the audit of major taxes (including
VAT and mobile telephone company royalties), streamlining of tax credit management, and
efforts to enhance the effectiveness of the Directorate General of Customs and Indirect Taxes
(DGDDI). On the expenditure front, corrective measures have also been undertaken, among

2
which prohibition of ad hoc Treasury payment orders for extra budgetary spending, the
setting of a treasury committee to track more closely revenue and expenditure and to match
government resources with commitments. As a result of all these committed efforts, revenue
should stabilize and expenditure contained to levels that make it possible to meet the primary
fiscal deficit target.
My authorities recognize that Benin’s economic and financial situation remains fragile and
vulnerable to external shocks, notably those stemming from its high dependence on cotton.
However, with further support from international community and perseverance in their
adjustment efforts, Benin should continue to make progress in reversing the decelerating
trend of GDP recorded in recent years, while striving to meet the MDGs. As regards the issue
of competitiveness, we take good note of the exchange rate appreciation since the 1994
devaluation. However, as we have oftentimes stated on regional issues, this problem should
be looked at from a regional perspective. At the same time, the structural reforms already
undertaken or envisaged by the authorities are aimed to underpin competitiveness, notably
facilitation of access to land and to credit, improvement of the business environment,
privatization of the utilities and cotton sectors, greater effectiveness of the autonomous Port
of Cotonou especially through a larger range of activities at the management center for the
one-stop shop, and preparation for the involvement of the private sector in the management
of port facilities.
As regards program implementation, my authorities -despite the difficulties highlighted
above and that stemmed from factors much beyond their control- have succeeded to meet
five of seven quantitative performance criteria at end-June 2006, in addition to the two
indicative target. The criterion related to the accumulation of domestic payments arrears was
not met for the fiscal difficulties outlined above, but measures have been taken to avoid
further arrears as noted above. Weak capacities and low delivery of financial and technical
assistance delayed the implementation of structural reforms and resulted in the
nonobservance of structural performance criteria and benchmarks. However, structural
performance criteria and benchmarks have all been implemented as of today, albeit with the
delays. Moreover, prior actions for the completion of this first review have all been
implemented. These actions include the adoption by the Council of Ministers of the strategies
and timetable for government disengagement from the cotton, electricity and
telecommunications sectors; the selection of an auditing firm to assess the viability of
outstanding domestic arrears and to develop an arrears clearance strategy; and the formal
reaffirmation of the government’s commitment to neither guarantee nor contract
nonconcessional loans. These actions as well as the proposed program conditionality for the
rest of 2006 and 2007 demonstrate the authorities’ strong commitment in the areas of
governance, accountability and reforms.
In view of these strong actions and commitment, my authorities request waivers for
nonobservance of missed performance criteria and the completion of the first review under

3
the PRGF arrangement. As we note that external assistance has fallen short of expectations
and is critically lacking despite the MDRI-related benefits, we call upon the international
community to deliver on aid commitments and further increase financial assistance to Benin.
I. Recent economic developments
In recent years, the Beninese economy has on one hand been hit by exogenous factors
involving sharp decline in international cotton prices and, consequently, falling cotton
production, and the other hand faced internal factors including delays in structural reforms
which affected the competitiveness of the economy. Consequently, real GDP growth rate is
estimated to have reached 2.9 percent in 2005 against 3.1 percent in 2004, and 3.9 percent in
2003. However, a rebound of economic activities, following improvements in trade relations
with Nigeria, along with an increase of traffic from the Port of Cotonou, has contributed to
render the 2006 prospects more optimistic. The available data point to a projected growth
rate of 4.5 percent in 2006. These favorable developments of economic activities are also due
to the settlement of delayed debts to farmers, ginners and inputs suppliers in April 2006,
which boosted the production of cotton in 2006. After an unusual surge of inflation in 2005
(3.7 percent), reflecting partly high oil prices, inflation is estimated to have been brought
down to 2.5 percent in 2006.
Regarding the external sector, in spite of the loss of competitiveness, owing to the continued
appreciation of Euro (to which CFA franc is pegged) against US dollar and, mostly, large
terms of trade declines resulting from falling world cotton prices and escalating petroleum
product prices, the current account deficit has been subdued in 2006 and Benin’s share of the
BCEAO’s foreign exchange reserves reached 10 months of imports cover in 2006.
The regional central bank, the BCEAO, continues to prove its ability to ensure a relevant
monetary policy. Indeed, in face of broad money and credit to private sector expansion,
which increased respectively by over 22 percent and 20 percent in 2005, the BCEAO has
tightened its monetary conditions by raising the reserve requirement ratio up to 15 percent,
the highest level among the WAEMU member countries. As regard the financial system, it is
worth noting that the sector has been steadily growing, that most banks meet key prudential
norms, and that reforms to address governance and other portfolio weaknesses in two banks
have been completed. The regional Banking Commission should be commended for its
supervisory work.
On the fiscal front, as noted above, my authorities put in place in the second quarter of 2006
a set of corrective fiscal measures, including (i) the institution of treasury committee to
monitor revenue collection, (ii) the strict respect of expenditure execution procedures; and
(iii) a renewed commitment to not undertake extrabudgetary expenditures. Their efforts to
improve revenue collection and contain expenditures cover a wide range of areas, including
customs, tax administration, and expenditure management and monitoring.

4
II. Medium-term challenges and objectives
Down the road, as well documented in Staff Report, Benin faces at least four important
challenges: (i) preserving or improving macroeconomic stability, (ii) reinvigorating growth
by completing the reforms to revitalize the cotton sector, Port of Cotonou, and utility
companies, (iii) improving the business climate, so as to strengthen the private sector, and
(iv) accelerating poverty reduction. In this regard, my authorities remain committed to
maintaining macroeconomic stability and accelerating structural reforms. My authorities also
intend to raise the investment-to-GDP ratio from 20 percent in 2005 to 22.5 percent in 2008,
in particular by using the fiscal space allowed by the debt relief and increased domestic
revenue collection resulting from the positive effects of structural reforms palpable as early
as 2006. As a result of these efforts, my authorities expect that over the three year period to
2008, the real GDP growth rate will average 4.5 – 5.5 percent, with inflation remaining
within the WAEMU convergence ceiling of 3 percent.
Fiscal Policies
As a translation of the above medium-term macroeconomic framework into fiscal objectives,
my Beninese authorities envisage to eliminate the narrowly defined primary deficit by 2008.
On the revenue side, while they expect a gradual positive fiscal impact of ongoing reforms,
the authorities have taken a set of measures focused on the improvement of tax and customs
administration. To that end, they envisage to (i) improve the management of medium-andlarge-taxpayers units’ activities, while computerizing tax assessment and collection
operations; (ii) ensure a better customs control of imported goods; (iii) better exchange of
taxpayers data between the General Tax Administration and Customs Directorates; (iv)
modernize property tax ; and (v) introduce Unified Tax Identification Number. In order to
reaffirm their commitment to implementing those measures, my authorities announced that in
case of revenue shortfalls, they stand ready to take corrective measures, including
expenditure cuts.
On the expenditure side, the authorities have clearly expressed the urgent need to improve
the poor’s access to basic services through higher and more efficient spending in priority
sectors. In this regard, they intend to devote most of freed resources through MDRI to
finance priority spending sectors, including education, health, and infrastructure projects. My
authorities pay due attention to the staff’s advice recommending to be cautious in contracting
new loans in order to preserve debt sustainability, improved significantly after MDRI debt
relief from Fund, World Bank and African Development Bank. The government, in
collaboration with development partners, is considering a clearance plan to solve the longstanding problems of wage arrears. At the same time, my authorities are taking necessary
actions to accelerate the preparation of civil service reform undertaken, with World Bank and
other development partners’ assistance. The authorities are still exploring a new direction to

5
restore in the medium-term the viability of the civil service pension fund and would
appreciate Fund’s technical assistance.
Structural Reforms
My authorities have demonstrated their strong commitment to structural reforms by
implementing the prior actions for the completion of this first review under the PRGF
program and are resolved to implement the proposed conditionality for the remainder of this
program. Indeed, in their strategy to maintain close collaboration with partners, an agreement
on a revised structural agenda has been reached between the authorities, the World Bank and
Fund’s staff. The objectives set out in this agreement invite the authorities to (i) to complete
government withdrawal from commercial activities in the cotton sector by mid-2007; (ii)
bring to the point of sale the electricity company by the end of August 2007; (iii) start
operations of the consolidated electronic billing system at the centralized clearing and
invoicing management center by end of December 2006. As for the telecommunications, the
authorities have a slightly different point of view from the World Bank in the timing of
privatization. As rightly underscored above, the authorities expect to break off with the
recurrent discussions made on this issue in the past and require necessary time to make a
relevant assessment of the company situation, put in place a new management team, prepare
a diagnostic of the telecom parastatal, and restructure the company first. In this context, they
suggest to bring the company to the point of sale by end-January 2009.
My authorities have taken note of slow progress in improving the business environment and
the high costs of doing business in Benin. They intend to take the necessary measures to
reverse this trend, notably by reducing the burdensome regulations, addressing the
institutional weaknesses, and implementing the reforms as envisaged, including in the cotton
sector. In order to ensure a full success of the reform agenda, they have elaborated secondgeneration reforms aimed at removing critical obstacles to the implementation of structural
reforms. The program aims to improve access to land, markets, and business environment.
Taking into account staff’s recommendations, my authorities are taking steps to create a
favorable climate of business, conducive to the needed development of private sector.
Regarding the financial sector, despite progress made in this area, as evidenced by the
Banking prudential indicators, my authorities are also aware of the need to monitor closely
the high concentration of loans observed in a limited number of sectors (and companies) in
Benin.
Poverty Reduction
Important progress has been made in the implementation of the PRSP. Since the adoption of
the document in 2003, two annual progress reports have been performed and the third one is
projected to be achieved by December 2006. A revision for a PRSP II is underway and

6
should be completed by end-December 2006. An emphasis on the development of the private
sector and the role it can play in increasing growth has been included in the revised project.
III. Conclusion
Since 1990, Benin has embarked on far-reaching reforms, focused on the need to put in place
an efficient market-based economy. Important efforts have also been made to stabilize and
reduce the country’s vulnerability to exogenous shocks. Delays in implementing structural
reforms have not been due to lack of ownership, but rather to limited capacity. My authorities
recognize that further efforts are still needed to attain this objective. In particular, they
recognize that the Beninese economic situation requires vigorous measures to enhance its
diversification so as to render it more resilient to shocks. In this regard, my authorities have
shown their commitment to move forward by taking critical measures to push ahead the
reforms underway. They are, therefore, requesting the completion of the first review of the
PRGF arrangement and waivers for the missed performance criteria, for which they have
already taken the necessary steps to address.
My beninese authorities remain fully determined to preserve the country’s debt sustainability
gained from debt relief under the HIPC and MDRI initiatives, and they are grateful to the
international community for this assistance. However, there has not been additional
assistance on the part of the donors to underpin their daunting efforts towards strong and
sustained growth. The financial and technical assistance of the international community,
including the Fund, remains critical to address these challenges. My authorities are hopeful
that they will benefit from increased support from all development partners.
