IMF Executive Board Concludes 2016 Article IV Consultation with Tuvalu

On September 12, 2016, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation1 with Tuvalu.
The macroeconomic outlook is stable. Real GDP growth in 2015 is estimated at 2.6 percent and
is projected to rise to 4 percent in 2016 on account of several large infrastructure projects and
recovery spending following Cyclone Pam. Inflation remained steady in 2015 at 3.2 percent and
is expected to rise slightly in 2016 to 3.5 percent as economic activity picks up.
The budget achieved a substantial surplus in 2015 for the fourth consecutive year, supported by
strong fishing license fees, internet license fees related to the “.tv” domain, and development
partner assistance. With four years of budget surpluses, fiscal buffers have been rebuilt and
remain at a comfortable level, even though expenditures have increased rapidly. The fiscal
position is expected to turn into a small deficit in 2016 and is projected to remain in deficit over
the medium term.
Risks to the outlook relate to the effects of climate change, volatility in fishing revenues, and
volatile global financial conditions, which could affect distributions to the budget from the
Tuvalu Trust Fund.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors noted that the near-term macroeconomic outlook is stable and growth is
picking up, partly owing to recovery spending following Cyclone Pam. Directors commended

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers
used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

the authorities for the substantial progress achieved under their Policy Reform Matrix, 2012-15,
as well as the commitment to continue these efforts under the national strategy for sustainable
development, 2016-2020. However, important medium- and long-term challenges remain. These
relate to sustaining investment to mitigate the effects of climate change, strengthening fiscal
frameworks, public enterprise reform, and financial sector oversight.
Directors observed that Tuvalu’s fiscal challenges are centered around revenue volatility and
meeting the long-term costs associated with climate change while maintaining a sound fiscal
position. They welcomed the recent initiatives to develop a climate change risk assessment
framework and to incorporate disaster costs into budget planning. Directors noted, however, that
improvements in public financial management were also needed, particularly with respect to the
framework for capital budgeting.
Directors welcomed the rebuilding of fiscal buffers on the back of higher fishing licensing
revenue in recent years. They underscored that sustaining adequate fiscal buffers is a critical
element in the policy strategy to manage future risks. In this respect, Directors called for restraint
on recurrent expenditure to sustain buffers and enhance debt sustainability. More broadly, the
adoption of a medium-term fiscal framework that targets a small structural budget surplus will
boost resilience. Directors also encouraged the authorities to continue seeking access to global
climate change funding, with the assistance of development partners.
Directors emphasized that public enterprise reform remains a key policy priority, including
improving corporate management and clearly defining and pricing social services. On financial
sector oversight, they highlighted that the banking commission should conduct a review of nonperforming assets and on-site supervision of banks, in collaboration with external advisors.
Directors welcomed the assessment that the exchange system is free of restrictions. While noting
that the real exchange rate is in line with fundamentals, they encouraged the authorities to
continue to implement the national development strategy to strengthen competitiveness.
Directors also urged the authorities to make use of technical assistance to improve economic
statistics.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
August 26, 2016

KEY ISSUES
Context. Tuvalu is a fragile micro-state facing tremendous challenges from its
remoteness, lack of scale economies, weak institutional capacity, and above all, climate
change, which threatens the country’s very existence. Thanks to buoyant fishing licensing
fees and grants, Tuvalu has accumulated fiscal buffers in recent years, but it is now
incurring significant costs rebuilding after the devastating Cyclone Pam in March 2015.
Looking ahead, Tuvalu faces substantial long-run costs in improving its infrastructure to
mitigate the effects of climate change.
Outlook and risks. The macroeconomic outlook is stable. Real GDP growth in 2015 is
estimated at 2.6 percent and is projected to rise to 4 percent in 2016 on account of
several large infrastructure projects and recovery spending following Cyclone Pam.
Inflation remained steady in 2015 at 3.2 percent and is expected to rise slightly in 2016
to 3.5 percent as economic activity picks up. Risks to the outlook relate to the effects of
climate change, volatility in fishing revenues and global financial conditions, which could
affect distributions to the budget from the Tuvalu Trust Fund. Domestically, continued
poor management of public enterprises is a key vulnerability.
Policy challenges. Tuvalu has made significant progress on structural reform under the
Policy Reform Matrix, 2012-15, but challenges remain. Tuvalu needs to reconcile fiscal
sustainability with the need for significant capital spending to enhance climate change
resilience. Continuing the recent performance will require recurrent expenditure
restraint, improvements in capital investment budgeting, and effective public enterprise
reform through enhanced governance and regulatory frameworks. The authorities are
encouraged to continue seeking multilateral and regional risks transfer arrangements, as
well as access to climate finance funding.
Other issues. Staff followed up on outstanding jurisdictional issues and completed the
assessment of the exchange system in Tuvalu. Tuvalu is an Article XIV member but does
not maintain exchange restrictions or multiple currency practices under Article XIV or
Article VIII.

US$3,800 is relatively high. Nevertheless, foreign
exchange inflows are highly volatile and the authorities have limited policy space — fiscal policy is
the only macro policy lever given the absence of a central bank and the use of Australian dollar as
the legal tender. The development of the private sector is constrained by the economy’s small size
limiting the scope for economic diversification and there are few employment opportunities outside
of government and public enterprises. The cost of providing basic government services — such as
health, education, sanitation, connectivity, transportation, and electricity — to a small and widely
dispersed population is very high.

3.
The authorities have recently unveiled a new development plan for 2016-20, Te
Kageeka III (TKIII), with a key focus on climate change mitigation (see Box 1). With the new
development plan, the authorities build on the previous plan with additional strategic reform
priorities, including addressing climate change; environment; urbanization and migration; and
oceans and seas. A policy reform matrix (PRM), formulated in consultation with development
partners, has successfully concluded the first three phases, 2012-15. Progress under the PRM will
now be evaluated and new targets formulated during 2016. The authorities have been receptive to
recent Fund policy advice and technical assistance, with substantial progress on overall
macroeconomic policies (for instance through the introduction of a medium-term budget framework
and building buffers) and fiscal management of the economy, although challenges to fiscal
sustainability remains. Tuvalu has generally made good progress towards meeting the Millennium
Development Goals, although there is only mixed progress combating non-communicable diseases
such as diabetes (see Box 1).

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS, OUTLOOK AND RISKS
4.
Tuvalu was severely impacted by Cyclone Pam in March 2015. While there were no
casualties, the cyclone is estimated to have affected 40 percent of the population and caused
damages and losses of A$14 million, or around 33 percent of GDP (the post-cyclone rapid
assessment covered agriculture, fisheries and infrastructure sectors). In the immediate crisis
response, the authorities prioritized food security, recovery and reconstruction spending, with
assistance from development partners. The reconstruction spending is expected to be financed by
development partner grants but also by drawing on accumulated buffers, including the Consolidated
Investment Fund (CIF).
5.
The near-term macroeconomic outlook remains stable. While the cyclone damaged some
productive capacity of the economy, particularly in the subsistence agricultural sector and
infrastructure, reconstruction activities have provided a short-term boost to growth. Real GDP
growth is estimated at 2.6 percent in 2015 and projected to rise to 4 percent in 2016 on account of
several large government-funded infrastructure projects (Viaiku Lagi waterfront reclamation and
school improvements) and recovery spending following Cyclone Pam. Growth has also been
supported by expansion of government spending on health, education and increased civil service
wages. Inflation remained steady in 2015 at 3.2 percent and is expected to rise slightly in 2016 to
3.5 percent as economic activity picks up. Over the medium term, real growth is projected to
moderate to around 2 percent (in line with average growth over the past decade), while inflation is
expected to remain in the 2-3 percent range. Over the longer run, rising sea levels, droughts, and
ocean acidification may damage Tuvalu’s infrastructure, erode coastlines, and reduce output
potential. 2

The evidence on the impact of natural disasters on long-run growth is mixed: the Cavallo and Noy (2010) survey of
the literature finds the limited evidence inconclusive, while Cabezon et al. (2015) find that for the Pacific islands, trend
growth over 1980-2014 was 0.7 percentage point lower than it would have been without natural disasters. See
Cabezon et al (2015), Enhancing Macroeconomic Resilience to Natural Disasters and Climate Change in the Small States
of the Pacific, IMF Working Paper No. 15/125; and Cavallo and Noy (2010), The Economics of Natural Disasters, A
Survey, IDB Working Paper Series, 124.

Box 1. Climate Change and Te Kakeega III - Tuvalu’s New National Strategy for Sustainable
Development, 2016-2020
In early 2016, the government unveiled its new development priorities for 2016-20 with the
broad theme to “Protect and Save Tuvalu”. Tuvalu has made substantial progress towards
meeting the Millennium Development Goals, although there has only been mixed progress on
combating non-communicable diseases such as diabetes. The new plan aligns with the UN
Sustainable Development Agenda and sets the direction for future development and meeting
development goals by 2030. It builds on the previous development plan, TKII, that covered 200515, and adds several priority areas, including climate change highlighting that “the danger of
climate change and the prospect of warming temperatures, sea level rise, and severe weather
events, overhang the entire discussion of future development”, with both short-run and longerterm policy implications.
Climate change mitigation costs are substantial. The TKIII cites an estimated cost of about
2 percent of GDP annually to build the country’s adaptive capacity by climate-proofing critical
infrastructure, adopting better early-warning systems for all hazards, and policy planning. The
climate change adaptation measures will generally involve infrastructure projects with large upfront capital and long-term maintenance costs. As illustrated by Cyclone Pam, the cost of disaster
impacts will be substantial, requiring assistance from development partners. The authorities have
established a new “Climate Change and Disaster Policy Unit” within the Office of the Prime
Minister to integrate climate change resilience into national policies, including contingency
planning, early warning systems and communication protocols.
Tuvalu is seeking to access climate finance and risks transfer schemes. Tuvalu’s greenhouse
gas emissions as a share of global emission (0.000005 percent) are statistically insignificant.
Nevertheless, Tuvalu’s energy policy has set an ambitious target for 100 percent renewable energy
by 2025; reducing total greenhouse gas emissions from energy consumption to 60 percent below
2010 levels by 2025 and further reduction from other sectors such as agriculture, conditional on
access to needed technology and finance. The government is exploring access to multilateral
climate finance schemes and risk transfer mechanisms to support its efforts to mitigate the effects
of climate change, including through the Green Climate Fund (see discussion in paragraphs 8 and
19), Adaptation Fund, Least Developed Country Fund, Special Climate Change Fund, and the
Global Environment Facility.

The budget achieved a substantial surplus in 2015 for the fourth consecutive year,
supported by strong fishing license fee revenue. After accounting for transfers of unspent budget

under the Nauru Agreement in mid-2012 that
limits the total number of fishing days and
vessels and charges higher minimum fees (see Annex 1). The recent above-average fishing license
fee revenue has also been favorably affected by El Niño conditions, which attracted tuna fish
migration into the warmer water in Tuvalu’s EEZ. Moreover, the depreciation of the Australian dollar
positively impacted the revenue performance as both fishing and internet license fees (for the “.tv”
internet domain, about 15 percent of GDP) are contracted in U.S. dollars (the real effective exchange
rate has depreciated by over 10 percent in the past two years). Donor grants were also substantial at
18 percent of GDP. Tax revenue is relatively small at around 19 percent of total revenue and has
performed broadly in line with economic developments.

Tuvalu Medical Treatment Scheme (TMTS), overseas education scholarships, and civil service wages
that can be expected to be more permanent. Over the past four years, expenses on the TMTS have
risen as the number of overseas referrals increased, relating to an aging population1 with high
incidence of non-communicable diseases like diabetes, and measures to contain costs have not
materialized; education scholarships spending has increased from 5 percent of GDP in 2012 to
8½ percent of GDP in 2015 as the number of students educated abroad has increased; and the civil
service wage bill have increased from 32 percent of GDP to 37½ percent. Subsidies for public
enterprises remained sizeable, estimated at around 2 percent of GDP in 2015. Special development
expenditures (which include capital investment spending) are estimated at 13 percent of GDP. Using
project-by-project data, staff estimate that around 2 percent of the capital spending in 2015 was
related to climate change mitigation (see Annex 2).

The fiscal position is expected to turn into a small deficit in 2016 and is projected to
remain in deficit over the medium term. Expenditures are expected to remain elevated in 2016,
partly owing to one-off expenditures on Cyclone Pam recovery (5 percent of GDP) and as the
accumulated project balances in the TDF are spent. The establishment of the A$5 million (around
10 percent of GDP) Tuvalu Survival Fund (TSF) in the 2016 budget is also expected to be a one-off
allocation.2 But there is also strong growth of recurrent expenditures such as wages and salaries,
TMTS, and scholarship spending. The authorities have introduced a reform plan to contain spending
on TMTS but the spending level is expected to remain elevated owing to the difficulty of quickly
tackling the high cost of health care provision and multi-year commitments for scholarship spending.
On the revenue side, fishing license fees are expected to remain strong in 2016, projected around
A$25 million. Against this background, staff projects a deficit of around 2¾ percent of GDP in 2016,
smaller than the deficit of 13 percent envisaged in the budget, partly owing to under-spending on
ambitious budget plans for special development expenditure. Going forward, staff expects fishing

license revenues to moderate to around A$20 million starting in 2017 as the El Niño cycle wanes.
This level of fishing license revenue is in line with recent historical averages (since the VDS Scheme
was introduced) and is also recommended as prudent budgeting in the new development plan for
2016-20, TKIII. With fishing license revenue returning to recent averages, and elevated recurrent
spending, the budget is projected to remain in deficit over the medium term (see Table 2). The
government’s application to the Green Climate Fund (GCF) for improving outer-island coastal
protection was recently approved. The disbursement schedule for this large project is still under
discussion, but it will likely span beyond the medium term (2021), with a long-term US$36 million
grant but also an estimated US$3 million government contribution.
9.
The Tuvalu Trust Fund (TTF) continued to perform well. The Fund’s value stood at around
A$148 million (340 percent of GDP) in 2015, exceeding by A$5 million the Fund’s “maintained value”,
i.e., the inflation-adjusted baseline used for approving distributions from the Fund. Balances in the
CIF have also increased, to A$26 million at end-2015, above the target CIF balance of 16 percent of
the maintained value of the TTF (see Annex 3 for background discussion of the fiscal framework). In
addition, the authorities established the TSF to finance recovery and rehabilitation from climate
change impacts, and adaptation projects, although the governance structure and disbursement
procedures of the Fund are still under discussion.

Along with the strong fiscal performance, the balance of payments position remains in
surplus driven by fishing license fees and continued donor inflows. The labor market for Tuvalu’s
merchant seamen has collapsed in recent years owing to increased international competition,
limiting remittance income. Nevertheless, strong fishing license fees and donor inflows have
contributed to gross reserves covering around 7 months of imports and are expected to remain at a
comfortable level in 2016. The current account surplus reached 7½ percent of GDP in 2015, while a
small deficit is expected in 2016 on account of increased government consumption and the reserve
coverage ratio is expected to decline over the medium term as government deficits rise.
11.
The financial sector remains saddled with substantial non-performing loans. Owing to
resource and capacity constraints, Tuvalu has not been able to establish an independent banking
commission. The financial sector, consisting of two banks, National Bank of Tuvalu (NBT) with around

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TUVALU

90 percent of total banking sector assets and the smaller Development Bank of Tuvalu (DBT), is
effectively unregulated. With the assistance of Pacific Financial and Technical Assistance Center
(PFTAC) advice, the Banking Commission Act of 2011 has been amended to allow the Minister of
Finance to be the de-facto Banking Commissioner, and the oversight authority has been delegated
to the Permanent Secretary for Finance. Reflecting its money transfer operations, the NBT has a long
track record of profitability and capital appears adequate, but both the NBT and the DBT remain
saddled with a large share of non-performing loans (around half of the lending portfolio is
nonperforming), primarily related to state-owned enterprises and a failed housing loan scheme. Both
banks have made substantial provisions (DBT provisions amount to 58 percent of gross loans, while
NBT has fully provisioned for bad loans), but an accurate estimate of bank capital adequacy is
impeded by the absence of on-site supervision. In addition to the two banks, the Tuvalu National
Provident Fund (TNPF) invests social security contributions and it can also extend credit to members
(not exceeding 30 percent of the balance).
12.
There are both short-term and longer-term risks to the outlook (see Risk Assessment
Matrix). Projections of fishing license fees are highly uncertain. The recent sharp increase in revenue
from fishing license fees may prove transitory, as tuna fish is a migratory species and the population
in Tuvalu’s water could decline sharply in response to changes in weather conditions and,
consequently, revenues could decline further than assumed in the baseline scenario. On the upside,
fishing revenues could continue to remain stronger than recent averages. Increased volatility in
Australia’s asset markets where the TTF is invested, could imply large swings in market value and
reduce transfers to Tuvalu’s budget. Other external risks include donor aid volatility and further
declines in remittances, continuing the sharp downturn after the Global Financial Crisis. On the
domestic side, loss-making public enterprises and gaps in the regulation of banks pose contingent
liabilities to the budget. Climate change related risks are expected to accumulate in the longer term.
In an alternative scenario, the Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) suggests the risk of debt distress
can be reduced by targeting a small structural surplus over the medium term (see discussion below).

Authorities’ views
13.
The authorities broadly agreed with staff’s outlook and risks. They noted that the impact
of Cyclone Pam and the establishment of the TSF have created large one-off spending that has
contributed to elevated expenditures in 2015-16 and, in turn, created large swings in
macroeconomic aggregates given the small size of the economy. Measures to limit cost pressures in
health spending have not materialized owing to high incidence of non-communicable diseases (such
as diabetes) and difficulties in recruiting specialized doctors to perform procedures locally. The TKIII
continues the focus on education and aims to equip people with the skills and knowledge they need
to achieve a higher degree of self-reliance in a changing world and the spending on scholarships will
continue. The government will remain the driver of the economy given the small size of the private
sector. They agreed that fishing license fee revenues have been growing strongly and view using an
A$18-20 million projection range as conservative but prudent, although they view risks skewed to
the upside.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS: BUILDING RESILIENCE
With rising sea levels, risks from climate change to the economy over the longer run are increasing.
Looking ahead, with a narrow and volatile revenue base it will be important to preserve fiscal space to
continue climate change mitigation investment and to enhance sustainability. Continuing the recent
performance will require recurrent expenditure restraint and effective public enterprise and financial
sector reform.

A. Fiscal Policy and Public Financial Management
14.
Although the fiscal situation has improved in recent years, Tuvalu’s fiscal challenges
continue to revolve around revenue volatility and long-term costs of climate change. With
rising temperatures and sea level, Tuvalu is likely to face increased frequency and intensity of
weather events. The fiscal policy framework should balance sustainability with substantial investment
needs to enhance resilience to climate change. To incorporate the costs of climate change into the
macroeconomic framework, staff recommends a forward-looking, multi-pillar approach: (i) risk
assessment and risk reduction; (ii) sustaining fiscal buffers; and (iii) international risk sharing.

Macroeconomic Framework

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TUVALU

15.
Climate change mitigation is a key policy priority. Tuvalu has spelled out its climate
change vulnerability and mitigating investment needs in the National Adaption Program of Action
(NAPA). The integration of climate resilience into national policies is the responsibility of the newly
established Climate Change and Disaster Policy Unit with the Office of the Prime Minister. The
authorities’ recent initiatives to develop a climate change risk assessment framework and
incorporating disaster costs into national budget planning are welcome (see Annex 2 for additional
background). For instance, the recent establishment of the TSF is intended to assist in climate change
mitigation and recovery, although the governance structure of the fund has not yet been specified.
The TKIII recognizes that substantial investment in climate resilience will be necessary, with an
estimated annual cost of 2 percent of GDP. In this context, a clearer classification between recurrent
and capital expenditures would facilitate better budgeting and monitoring of climate change
mitigation investment.
16.
A long-term capital budgeting framework is needed for effective climate change
mitigation. The climate change adaptation measures will generally involve infrastructure projects
with large up-front capital and long-term maintenance costs. Going forward, the Tuvalu
Infrastructure Strategy Investment Plan provides a long-term road map of projects, most of which
have a climate change component. Although the infrastructure plan for climate change risk
reduction is in place, consistent implementation is essential. The work underway to establish an
infrastructure asset register will also be important to facilitate budgeting of the expected economic
life and needed maintenance of existing assets. In this context, improvements in the fiscal
management framework (capital budgeting and public financial management) will be needed to
guide the medium-term budgeting process. In addition, continued progress in public financial
management reform may improve the quality of spending and support additional development
partner assistance. The recent Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability self-assessment found
substantial progress in many areas, with scores improving in critical areas of accounting and financial
reporting, but some areas remain weak such as procurement and expenditure arrears.

Box 2. Fiscal Adjustment Scenario
The baseline projection for fiscal policy entails a significant reduction in fiscal buffers and a
deterioration in macroeconomic stability. The CIF balance would fall below the sustainable
target of 16 percent of the maintained value of the TTF, with reserves coverage falling to below
6 months of imports over the medium term. At the same time, the baseline fiscal plans need to
take into account the need for Tuvalu to continue enhance its resilience to climate change
(building infrastructure such as sea walls, land reclamation, etc.), the cost of which is estimated at
2 percent of GDP per year.

In the adjustment scenario, staff recommend that the authorities exercise recurrent
expenditure restraint to maintain space for climate resilient infrastructure investment and
make progress towards medium-term fiscal targets. By targeting a small structural surplus
(around 1 percent of GDP), buffers are maintained to manage risks related to increased frequency
of weather events. This could be achieved by civil service wage restraint (ensuring that wage
increases are broadly in line with productivity gains), scaling back the strong increases in
government subsidies (TMTS, scholarships and public enterprises) as well as goods and services
purchases (see text table). Given high revenue dependence on fishing and internet license fees
and grants, there is relatively less scope for tax revenue measures in the adjustment.
This adjustment scenario entails less external borrowing, and the risk of debt distress is
significantly reduced (see the adjustment scenario of the DSA). Increased capital spending
may increase imports of goods and services, leading to higher current account deficits. However, it
is difficult to assess whether it would be significantly different compared to current policies given
that the expenditures on TMTS and scholarships have a very high import content.

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TUVALU



Baseline scenario. Under the baseline scenario, moderating fishing revenues and continued
elevated recurrent spending pressures relating to civil service wages, TMTS, scholarships, public
enterprise subsidies, and other goods and services purchases, would result in persistent budget
deficits over the medium term. On capital spending, the baseline scenario includes continued
climate change mitigation investment of 2 percent of GDP annually. Under this scenario, fiscal
buffers in the CIF are expected to decline over the medium term to below the 16 percent
sustainable floor relative to the maintained value of the TTF. The DSA (2016-36) indicates that
Tuvalu remains at high risk of debt distress, with a breach of indicative thresholds towards the
end of the projection period.3



Adjustment scenario. Under an adjustment scenario, staff recommends that the authorities
target a small structural fiscal surplus (around one percent of GDP) over the medium-to-long
term. Specifically, spending should be based on cautious assumptions regarding fishing license
fees, with realistic assumptions based on fishing yields being in the A$20 million range (around
40 percent of GDP). Spending restraint is assumed to come from aligning wage growth to
productivity gains in the economy, public enterprise reforms to limit budget subsidies, and
increased efficiency of recurrent spending, including better targeting and tracking of spending
on TMTS and scholarships. This scenario would maintain buffers in the CIF well above the
sustainable threshold, allow re-investment of TTF distributions to build up balances towards the
A$200 million target by 2020, and reduce longer-term borrowing and debt distress risks. Under
the structural balance approach, positive shocks to fishing license fees would result in fiscal
surpluses that can be saved in the CIF; similarly, CIF drawdowns can finance temporary shortfalls
in license fees. Over time, the baseline assumption for license fees should be adjusted to reflect
recent trends, perhaps using a six-year moving average (t-4 to t+1).

18.
Progress on public enterprise reform continues to be slow (see Annex 4). The public
enterprises (PE) remain hampered by a combination of below-cost tariff structures, payment arrears,
weak management capacity and most thus require government subsidies to operate. The staffing of
the Public Enterprise Reform Management Unit remains plagued by vacancies and high turnover.
The majority of PEs requires annual subsidies and capital injections to remain viable, and therefore
reform remains a policy priority, including improving corporate governance; cleaning up balance
sheets on the basis of sound accounting; clearing unpaid taxes; and clearly defining and costing
remaining social responsibilities. There has been some progress in recent years. For instance, the sale
of the main hotel – Vaiaku Lagi – is progressing. To enhance the government oversight of public
enterprises in the Public Enterprise Review and Monitoring Unit, staffing continuity and workforce
planning is needed. While not a PE, the financial situation of the Tuvalu Cooperative Society (TCS) is
deteriorating due to sizeable arrears to suppliers and banks (amounting to around 4 percent of
GDP), combined with rapidly accumulating interest rate costs. A comprehensive action plan is

3

Annex 3).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

TUVALU

urgently needed to restore financial viability. In the long run, higher PE profitability will increase the
flow of dividends and ease fiscal pressures.
International risk sharing
19.
International risk sharing will be important to alleviate risks relating to climate change.
Tuvalu has been actively seeking access to multilateral funding of climate change mitigation, such as
the GCF, Adaptation Fund, Special Climate Change Fund and the Global Environment Facility. Going
forward, increasing capacity to meet the accreditation and fiduciary standards of these initiatives will
be important for timely access to financing. In this context, it is encouraging that Tuvalu’s application
to the GCF for a long-term US$36 million project to build outer island coastal protection was
recently approved. Exploring options for disaster insurance could also spread the financial burden of
recovering from natural disaster, although the menu of options is currently limited in this area.
Authorities’ views
20.
The authorities broadly agreed with staff’s analysis. With above-average fishing revenue in
recent years, the authorities’ will continue to focus on building up buffer funds, aiming to reach a balance
of A$200 million (380 percent of projected 2020 GDP) in the TTF by 2020. The authorities are cognizant of
the rapid rise in recurrent expenditures and have introduced a reform plan to increase efficiency in the
health sector in the National Health Reform Plan (2016-19), but also recognized the challenges in reducing
costs over the medium term with an aging population and high incidence of non-communicable diseases.
On civil service wages, the authorities highlighted the high cost of living given the small size of the market
which needs to be reflected in wages. Public enterprise reform remains a key priority for the government,
where management needs to improve to limit the subsidies that weaken the government’s financial
position. The authorities are working on a reform plan to revive the TCS and the vital role it plays in
providing food security to the remote outer islands and a high-level working group has been established.

B. Financial Sector Reform
21.
The financial sector needs effective oversight. The level of non-performing loans in the NBT
and the DBT appears to have declined over the past two years, but they remain at high levels. The DBT will
need additional capital to increase lending,4 while the NBT appears to have a sufficient capital cushion to
write off the non-performing loans without a capital injection. The Banking Commissioner should conduct
on-site examinations and a non-performing asset review, with the assistance of PFTAC advisors.
22.
Access to financial services could be broadened. There is no foreign bank presence in Tuvalu,
but the authorities have expressed interest in cooperating with a foreign bank to facilitate international
banking services (including ATM access). More broadly, access to financial services is hampered by the lack
of effective collateral, partly relating to customary land ownership, but also lack of financial literacy. In this
context, TNPF is a key source of financial access where participants can access up to 1/3 of the member’s
4
Subject to the findings of a detailed review, the upper range for DBT’s capital need is perhaps in the 2 percent of
GDP range.

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TUVALU

contribution. TNPF is also providing financial education to members approaching retirement age, but
broader efforts to enhance financial literacy are needed. Tuvalu’s largest bank, the NBT has maintained the
key working international correspondent banking relationships, but access to some currency clearing
services is complicated.

C. External Assessment
23.
The real exchange rate is broadly in line with the long-run average (Annex 5). While the level
of the real exchange rate has returned to its 20-year average and there is no sign of significant
misalignment, the economy’s competitiveness remains weak, with remoteness causing high transportation
costs and the lack of scale increasing fixed costs.5 The real exchange rate plays a limited role in current
account developments, which are mostly driven by exogenous factors such as fishing and internet
licensing fees and donor flows. However, continued expansion of government spending could result in
increased imports and a deterioration of the external position.

D. Other issues
24.
Staff followed up on outstanding jurisdictional issues and completed the assessment of the
exchange system in Tuvalu. At the time of joining Fund, Tuvalu notified the Fund that it intended to avail
itself of transitional arrangements under Section 2 of Article XIV. Staff followed up on outstanding
jurisdictional issues and completed the assessment of the exchange system in Tuvalu. Tuvalu is an Article
XIV member but does not maintain exchange restrictions or multiple currency practices under Article XIV
or Article VIII. The authorities are considering whether to accept the obligations under Article VIII, but have
yet to reach a decision. On AML/CFT, the authorities joined Asia Pacific Group (APG) as an observer in
2014 and continue to strengthen their AML/CFT framework in anticipation of a future comprehensive
assessment. It has established a Transactions Tracking Unit in the Tuvalu Police Force to track suspicious
transactions.
Authorities’ views on financial sector, exchange rate assessment and other issues
25.
The authorities broadly agreed with staff assessment and are cognizant of the need to
strengthen the banking sector. They highlighted the role of broader financial access to facilitate credit to
small and medium sized enterprises to facilitate broader-based economic growth. Development of mobile
banking is hampered by poor connectivity. The authorities are looking to strengthen banking supervision,
drawing on development partner expertise, and have requested PFTAC technical assistance. They agreed
the exchange rate is in line with economic fundamentals.

An EBA-lite style assessment of exchange rate alignment is not feasible due to data limitations and is of limited informative value
given the prominent role of exogenous factors, especially the highly volatile fishing license fees and commodity prices. The use of
the Australian dollar as the legal tender remains appropriate, given strong trade and financial linkages and limited capacity to run an
independent monetary institution.

5

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

TUVALU

E. Staff Appraisal
26.
The near-term macroeconomic outlook is stable. Real GDP growth is picking up on account of
several large infrastructure projects and recovery spending following Cyclone Pam, while inflation is
expected to remain stable. With four years of budget surpluses, fiscal buffers have been rebuilt and remain
at a comfortable level. At the same time, expenditures have grown quickly and fiscal deficits are expected
over the medium term. Risks to the outlook relate to the effects of climate change, sharper-than-expected
decline in fishing revenues, and a global financial downturn, which could affect distributions to the budget
from the TTF. There is no sign of significant exchange rate misalignment.
27.
Tuvalu has made marked progress on structural reform under the PRM, but challenges
remain. All the reforms set out through a consultative process with development partners in the PRM
2012-15 have been implemented. Substantial improvements have been made in the overall
macroeconomic and fiscal management of the economy. Nevertheless, important challenges remain and
staff encourages the authorities to continue building on the reform momentum and work with
development partners in a possible fourth phase of the PRM to be aligned with the new development
agenda, TKIII, with important priorities including enhancing fiscal sustainability, strengthened fiscal
frameworks, sustaining climate change investment, public enterprise reform and financial sector oversight.
28.
Tuvalu’s fiscal challenges continue to revolve around revenue volatility and sustainably
meeting the long-term costs of climate change. The authorities’ recent initiatives to develop a climate
change risk assessment framework and incorporating disaster costs into national budget planning are
welcome, but a clearer classification between recurrent and capital spending to budget and monitor
climate change mitigation investment is recommended. Staff welcomes the establishment of the TSF,
subject to effective governance covenants, as a mechanism to quickly respond to the impact of natural
disasters.
29.
A long-term capital budgeting framework is needed for effective climate change
mitigation. The Tuvalu Infrastructure Strategy Investment Plan provides a long-term road map of projects,
but consistent implementation is essential. In this context, improvements in the fiscal management
framework will be needed to guide the medium-term budgeting process. In addition, continued progress
in public financial management reform may improve the quality of spending and support additional
development partner assistance. Improved access to global climate change funding, supplemented by
insurance and other international risk sharing facilities, will be important to manage the costs of climate
change. Meeting the accreditation and fiduciary standards – with the continued help of development
partners – of these initiatives will be important for timely access to financing.
30.
Sustaining fiscal buffers will be critical in mitigating risks related to climate change and
revenue volatility. With a narrow and volatile revenue base, it is essential to maintain buffers at the
sustainable level. However, without restraining the strong growth in recurrent spending under current
policies, fiscal buffers are expected to decline over the medium term. An adjustment scenario entailing
recurrent expenditure restraint would provide fiscal space for essential climate change capital investment

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TUVALU

and allow re-investment of TTF distributions to build up balances towards the authorities’ A$200 million
target by 2020.
31.
Public enterprise reform remains a policy priority and the financial sector needs effective
oversight. Reform priorities include improving corporate governance; cleaning up balance sheets on the
basis of sound accounting; clearing unpaid taxes; and clearly defining and costing remaining social
responsibilities. In the long run, higher PE profitability will increase the flow of dividends and ease fiscal
pressures. The Banking Commissioner should conduct on-site examinations and a non-performing asset
review, with the assistance of PFTAC advisors. Efforts to promote financial literacy should also be enhanced
to promote wider access to financial services and stimulate private sector development.
32.
Staff followed up on outstanding jurisdictional issues and completed the assessment of the
exchange system in Tuvalu. Staff encourages the authorities to accept the obligations under Article VIII,
Sections 2(a), 3 and 4.
33.
Statistics and data reporting, particularly national accounts and balance of payments
statistics, remain weak and impede economic assessments. The authorities should increase statistical
staffing and actively seek technical assistance from the Fund and PFTAC.
34.

It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the current 24-month

cycle.

TUVALU

Annex I. The Fisheries Sector in Tuvalu
The fish stock is Tuvalu’s most important natural resource. Tuvalu’s EEZ of about 900,000 square
kilometers is almost 28,000 times its land area, and has an abundance of tuna resources which gets
boosted during the El Nino-Southern Oscillation.1 Fish constitute a large share of Tuvalu’s exports and
given the limited and infertile land area, fish is also an important source of food for the population.
The Vessel Day Scheme (VDS) under the Parties to Nauru Agreement (PNA) has worked well for
Tuvalu. The PNA controls the largest sustainable purse seine tuna fisheries area in the world and
around half of the global supply of skipjack tuna. In 2010, the PNA members established a VDS to limit
purse seine fishing in their waters which also allowed transferability of vessel days amongst members.
As a result, access fees have increased and Tuvalu’s revenues from fishing license fees reached a record
60 percent of GDP in 2015.
The United States (US) South Pacific Treaty which started in 1988 has also benefited Tuvalu. The
Treaty has been restructured and extended a number of times over the years and included an economic
assistance package to Forum Fisheries Agency and more recently had also incorporated the VDS.
However, in early 2016, the U.S. government announced plans to withdraw from the Treaty due to
rising costs and other viability concerns. Nonetheless, the Pacific countries and the US were keen to
discuss a restructured Treaty that would be mutually beneficial in the long term. In June 2016, a new
agreement was reached by the U.S. government officials and the Forum Fisheries Agency which is
planned to come into effect from 2017. The new agreement is expected to provide more flexibility to
the U.S. boats in choosing the type and number of fishing access days. The revised treaty is expected to
provide returns of over US$14,000 per fishing day (compared to just over US$11,000 per fishing day in
2016) and last for six years. However, the agreement is currently in principle only, and both the U.S. and
Pacific governments need to endorse the deal.
Despite the benefits from the VDS, fishing license fee remain volatile and the recent surge in
license fees may be unsustainable. The use of fish aggregating devices is proving controversial as it
can disrupt the mechanics of the VDS where days are allotted based on the volume of historical catches
as well as sustainability of fish stocks. This has resulted in lobbying to ban usage of fish aggregating
devices in the PNA area totally or at least during the spawning months. Over the longer term, market
conditions, climate change, failure in regional cooperation on the shared resource, and overfishing can
easily erode fish stocks and the premium prices received in license fee and therefore affect fiscal
planning as well as future livelihood.
Better utilization and value-adding in the fisheries sector remains a long term challenge. While
the Tuvalu government has entered joint ventures with foreign companies in fishing, there is little value
addition in Tuvalu. The ability to capitalize fully on its most important resource is hindered mostly by
capacity constraints in transport and storage, limited private sector development, access to credit, and
other technical constraints related to value addition of fisheries resources.
1

The El Nino-Southern Oscillation refers to the oscillation between a warm (El Nino) and a cold (La Nina) state
every 2-7 years in the tropical Pacific Ocean, which has a very strong influence on the distribution and abundance
of tuna. See Pacific Possible, Tuna Fisheries, World Bank Group, May 2016.

Annex II. Climate Change Investment in Tuvalu
Rising sea levels threaten Tuvalu’s existence. Recent estimates of rising sea levels in Tuvalu indicate
that the annual change has accelerated from around 1mm per year in the 1980s to an estimated 5mm
per year since the early 1990s. Rising sea levels result in less resilient coastlines during tropical storms
and other natural disasters.
Tuvalu has made climate-proofing a key policy measure in their recent medium-term fiscal
framework and Infrastructure Strategy and Investment Plan. Investment has begun across a number
of areas, including fortifying coastlines of the outer islands, refurbishing schools and other government
buildings to serve as evacuation centers, and upgrading communication systems across the islands. In
2015, the authorities spent an estimated 2.2 percent of GDP (roughly A$1m) on climate-change
infrastructure projects, with several additional upgrades planned for the medium term.1
Climate-proofing will require the use of existing fiscal buffers, with donor support in the medium
term. The World Bank estimates the cost of climate-proofing measures at 2 percent of GDP per year
over the long term, most of which will come in the form of capital expenditures. In the near term, the
authorities will draw down on existing fiscal buffers (the CIF and the Tuvalu Survival Fund) to finance
these investments. Should the value of the CIF fall below prudent levels, as envisaged in the baseline
scenario, the authorities will rely on donor support for financing in the medium and long term. Donor
financing is expected to average more than 20 percent of GDP over the period 2022-2036.
Mitigating the effects of climate change puts Tuvalu’s long-term debt path on a higher
trajectory. External financing, combined with other high-priority expenditures, will weigh on the fiscal
balance in the long term. Under the baseline scenario, the balance, which averaged a surplus of over
14 percent of GDP between 2011-2015, is projected to fall to an average deficit of 6 percent of GDP in
the years 2016-2036. Public sector debt, which stood at 58 percent of GDP in 2015, will rise to
70 percent in 2036 in the baseline scenario. The costs incurred by these projects should be partially
offset by reduced subsidies to public enterprises and more efficient social spending.
Long-term planning and prioritization will be needed. Capacity constraints and remoteness may
create delays in implementation and higher costs if the spending is front-loaded. Investments should
thus be laid out over the long term, prioritizing urgent upgrades in the near term. The preparation of
the upcoming Asset Management Framework is a welcome development. The Framework will estimate
replacement costs and annual maintenance requirements of the current stock of infrastructure assets in
Tuvalu. The Framework will be used to identify maintenance and eventual replacement needs for these
assets, and will be a key input in future updates of Infrastructure Strategy and Investment Plan. The
recent creation of the Climate Change and Disaster Policy Unit within the Office of the Prime Minister is
another important development. The Unit will track ongoing climate change investment and will
facilitate much-needed coordination among donors.
1

The estimate includes only budgetary expenditures. Additional climate-proofing projects are directly financed by
donor partners and are considered off-budget.

Annex III. The Tuvalu Trust Fund and the Fiscal Framework
The Tuvalu Trust Fund (TTF) is an important source of budgetary revenue for the Tuvalu
government. It was created by Tuvalu and its main development partners in 1987, and the
original contribution of A$27 million has grown to A$148 million (around 340 percent of GDP) in
September 2015. When TTF’s market value exceeds the so called “maintained value” indexed to
Australia’s CPI, the excess will be transferred to the Consolidated Investment Fund (CIF), which can
be freely drawn by Tuvalu’s

average downturn of four
years, as illustrated in the periods 2001-04 and 2008-12, when the CIF balances were drawn down
as the TTF did not distribute. In 2016, the budget deficit will be funded by a drawdown of the CIF,
while broadly maintaining the target balance of 16 percent of the maintained value of the TTT.

The TTF is professionally managed and audited by international firms. The investment focus is
a combination of defensive (cash, bonds, fixed income instruments, 40 percent), diversified (assets
with low correlation with other asset classes, 30 percent) and growth (typically equity and
property, 30 percent) assets. The TTF is subject to an annual audit by international audit firms.
Withdrawal rules from the TTF are rigid. The withdrawal rules from the TTF are specified in the
Agreement Concerning an International Trust Fund for Tuvalu, and only in very exceptional
circumstances would the capital of the fund be considered to be drawn down by the Government
of Tuvalu. In the 29 years that the Fund has been operating this has not occurred (not even after
Cyclone Pam). The Board of Directors has all powers over the Fund. A director appointed by the
Government of Tuvalu is the Chairman of the Board and one director appointed by each other
original party to the agreement.
While an important source of funds for the government, the TTF distributions can be procyclical. The government’s available resources tend to rise when market returns (and economic
conditions) are high. Recognizing this, the Tuvaluan authorities have in many cases recapitalized
the TTF when times are good. The government, donors, and the TTF’s advisory committee have

Annex IV. Public Enterprise Reform
Public Enterprise reform remains a priority. With support from the Asian Development Bank and
other development partners, the policy and regulatory framework for public enterprises has improved,
including the establishment of the Public Enterprise Reform and Monitoring Unit in 2009; the
enactment of the Public Enterprises Act in 2009; the removal of politicians and civil servants from public
enterprise boards; the timely submission of audited annual reports to Parliament for all public
enterprises; and the merger of the Tuvalu Philatelic Bureau, Tuvalu Post Office, and Tuvalu Travel Office
into a single entity known as the Tuvalu Post and Travel Office. The government is progressing on the
sale of the Vaiaku Lagi Hotel.

The financial performance has improved, but remains weak for many PEs. The only PE with a
consistent track record of profits is NBT. The electricity provider’s (TEC) profitability is dependent on
government support as the tariff levels have been set lower than the cost of supply. In the absence of
government subsidies, TEC losses would have been $1.37 million in 2012, $1.80 million in 2013 and
$1.41 million in 2014. In 2014, the government approved $2.35 million of additional equity for DBT, TEC
and TTC, of which $2 million was used to pay off debt owed to NBT. The government also settled its
debt to VLHL which boosted the hotel’s profit and equity since the debt had previously been fully
provisioned. With the exception of TEC, the other PEs now have positive equity. The only PE which is
paying company tax is NBT.
Despite improved in PE performance, continued progress is needed to operate on commercial
basis and reduce government subsidies. With the assistance of development partner support,
resolving the cross-liabilities of unpaid bills to public enterprises by the government and unpaid taxes
to the government by public enterprises would also help operational management. More work is also
needed to contract out selected activities of the Public Works Department (PWD). The recent escalation
of government-funded capital works and cyclone reconstruction efforts has prompted the government
to develop a rationalization strategy to improve the commercial and financial viability of the PWD.

Annex V. External Sector and Exchange Rate Assessment
Tuvalu’s real effective exchange rate (REER)
has returned to its historical level. The REER
has depreciated by about 12 percent since its
recent peak in early 2013. The real depreciation
was mainly driven by the weakening of Australia
dollar, the legal currency used in Tuvalu.
Historically, Tuvalu’s REER has moved closely
with that of Australia, but has been less
appreciated since the global crisis. (Figure 1)

increase the risk of overvaluation over the
medium term. Benefiting from lower global food and commodity prices as well as increased trade
diversification and retail competition, Tuvaluan inflation has been below trading partners’ inflation.

Reserves appear sufficient, but would decline in the medium term.1 Significant increase in the CIF as
a result of fiscal surpluses in 2013-15 pushed reserves to a 7-8 months of imports (text Figure 2). In the
medium term, however, fiscal balance is expected to move into a widening deficit on the back of
stagnated fishing license fees and climate-related pressures on expenditure, which will cause the CIF to
decline over the medium term and a rise of imports. As a consequence, import reserve cover will decline
to below 6 months in the medium term. Although the reserve cover appears sufficient by traditional

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in
the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low”
is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability of
30 percent or more). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with
the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Approved By
Thomas Helbling and
Peter Allum, and Satu
Kahkonen (IDA)

Prepared jointly by the staffs of the International Monetary
Fund and the International Development Association

The Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) concludes that Tuvalu remains at a high risk of
debt distress. Although fiscal buffers have been replenished over the past four years, risks
to debt sustainability remain high owing to the increased recurrent fiscal spending in
2015 and the 2016 budget. Under the baseline scenario, the fiscal position would move
into a deficit from 2016 onwards as the spending is not sufficiently scaled back in the
context of normalizing revenue. In the medium term, external and public debt-to-GDP are
expected to fall below the indicative thresholds as fiscal buffers are drawn down to
amortize existing debt and to finance the fiscal deficit. However, in the long run, the debt
stock is expected to once again breach the indicative thresholds as fiscal buffers fall below
prudent levels and external borrowing is renewed. This trajectory underscores the
importance of targeting a small structural fiscal surplus to lower the risk of debt distress
while maintaining fiscal space to improve climate change resilience. In an adjustment
scenario, the risk of debt distress is lowered as recurrent spending is contained and a
small structural surplus is achieved, allowing fiscal buffers to remain above prudent levels.

TUVALU

RECENT DEBT DEVELOPMENTS
1.
The government’s external liabilities are a mix of concessional and commercial debt.
As of end-2015, total public and publicly guaranteed debt is estimated at US$19million, equivalent
to 58.2 percent of GDP. External debt stood at US$17.8 million (54.5 percent of GDP), and domestic
debt — owed to domestic banks — at US$1.2 million (3.8 percent of GDP). Bilateral donors provide
only grant assistance, while multilateral institutions, most notably the Asian Development Bank, have
provided concessional loans as well as grants to the government. Meanwhile, loans contracted at
nonconcessional terms by two fishing joint ventures established by the National Fishing Corporation
of Tuvalu (NAFICOT) and Asian companies account for a significant share of public debt. These loans
are guaranteed by the government, and constitute contingent government liabilities.1 In recent
years, one joint venture has been working on a new loan agreement to finance the expansion of its
fishing capacity, which implies an addition of public debt.

External assets remain sizeable, but not fully sovereign. The Tuvalu Trust Fund (TTF),
which was mainly capitalized by development partners in 1987, has grown from A$27 million to
more than A$148 million (around 340 percent of GDP) in 2015. The TTF is not fully sovereign and
cannot be drawn down freely: when its market value exceeds a “maintained value” indexed to
Australian CPI, the TTF Board—representing both donors and Tuvalu government—can decide to
transfer the excess to the budget. The transfers are deposited into the Consolidated Investment
Fund (CIF), which is a fiscal buffer fund used to finance future budget expenditures. The TTF assets
are invested abroad, mostly in Australia. Since access to the TTF by Tuvaluan government is
conditional, this DSA analyzes public debt on gross rather than net basis.

UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS
3.

The baseline macroeconomic framework can be summarized as follows:

1

An effectively defunct and wholly government-owned public enterprise called the National Fishing Corporation of Tuvalu
(NAFICOT) is party to the two fishing joint ventures (JV). NAFICOT owns 50 percent of the JV that was established together with a
company of the Taiwan Province of China, and 40 percent of the Korean one.

2

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TUVALU



Growth. Real GDP is projected to grow by an average of 2.2 percent per annum over the
medium term due to the implementation of a few large infrastructure projects financed by
grants from development partners.2 Over the long run, growth is projected to average 2 percent
driven mainly by climate change infrastructure investment but would continue to be hampered
by the dominance of inefficient public enterprises in the economy, capacity constraints, and
weak competitiveness.



Inflation. Owing to rapid increases of public spending and wages as well as reconstruction
spending from Cyclone Pam and a weakening Australian dollar, inflation is projected to reach
around 3 percent in the near term and moderate to 2.2 percent in the medium run, which is
similar to the 2014 DSA.



Balance of payments. In the baseline scenario, Tuvalu’s current account deficit would average
around 1 percent of GDP over the medium term, as revenues from fishing license fees return to
their historical average of roughly $A20 million. Imports fall from their 2016 peak over the
medium term but remain elevated relative to historical averages as a result of ongoing climateproofing investment. Exports continue to hover around 55 percent of GDP in the medium and
long term. The narrowing of the current account deficit vis-à-vis the 2014 DSA reflects the
unexpected windfalls from fishing license fees. FDI inflows would be minimal and mostly include
reinvestment of fishing joint venture earnings. Despite efforts of the authorities to privatize
certain public enterprises, there has been little success in attracting foreign investors, and
therefore no significant FDI inflows associated with privatization are assumed.



Fiscal. Expenditure is assumed to be higher over the projection period (compared to the 2014
DSA) reflecting strong increases in social spending and subsidies. Fishing and internet licensing
revenues are higher (compared to the 2014 DSA). They are assumed to be in line with recent
4-year averages and to remain buoyant in the medium term. Grants will gradually decline to
around 18.5 percent of GDP in the long run as reform implementation reduces the flows of
donor contributions to the budget. Given the weakening fishing license fees and foreign grants,
expenditures would be compressed gradually from 116 percent of GDP in 2015 to 94 percent of
GDP by 2036. On the expenditure side, recurrent spending, particularly toward the TMTS and
scholarships, remain elevated, while climate-proofing investment spending remains around
2 percent of GDP. The baseline scenario projects an overall fiscal deficit 5 percent of GDP over
the medium term. Concessional borrowing would remain small in the medium term as fiscal
buffers are drawn down, but then gradually increase as buffers are depleted over the longer run.

4.
Baseline assumptions: Under the baseline scenario, moderating fishing revenues and
continued elevated recurrent spending pressures related to civil service wages, TMTS, scholarships,
public enterprise subsidies, and other goods and services purchases, would result in persistent
budget deficits over the medium term. On capital spending, the baseline scenario includes the cost

TUVALU

of bolstering sea walls and other “climate-proofing” measures, estimated at 2 percent of GDP per
year over the long term, most of which will occur in the form of capital spending, but also
maintenance of existing infrastructure.3 Under this scenario, deficits will be financed through
drawdowns of the CIF, causing balances to fall below 16 percent of the maintained value of the TTF
over the medium term.
5.
Adjustment scenario assumptions: Under an adjustment scenario, wage growth is aligned
to productivity gains in the economy and public enterprise reform limits the budget subsidies. In
addition, with increased efficiency in spending on TMTS and scholarships (with development partner
assistance), buffers in the CIF are maintained above the sustainable threshold. The adjustment
scenario would also maintain fiscal space for essential climate change capital investment and allow
re-investment of TTF distributions to build up balances towards the A$200 million target by 2020.

DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
A. Baseline Scenario
6.
Under the baseline scenario, external and public debt breach the indicative threshold
of the debt-to-GDP ratio. The threshold for PV of Debt to GDP is determined by the CPIA index, a
measure of the country’s institutional capacity. The trajectory shows a decline in debt levels over the
medium term reflecting amortization of existing loans and limited borrowing. Two spikes in the debt
service profile in 2021 and 2027 are related to one-off repayments for the Korean joint venture
fishing vessel and a DBT equity injection. Increased borrowing in the outer years as buffers fall below
prudent levels (e.g. three months of current expenditures), implies that the debt trajectory begins to
rise again and breaches the threshold by the end of the projection period (Figure 1). New borrowing
would be mostly from external sources. Domestic financing will remain small due to severe asset
quality problems in the domestic banking system.
7.
Stress tests show to both external and public sector debt indicate that the debt ratios
are highly sensitive to exports and exchange rate shocks. A one-time 30 percent nominal
depreciation would cause the debt-to-GDP ratio to stay above the indicative threshold in most of
the projection period. A standard shock to exports also results in a breach of the debt-to-export
threshold.

B. Adjustment Scenario
8.
Under an adjustment scenario where fiscal policy is anchored by an appropriate fiscal
balance target, the risk of debt distress is lowered while maintaining fiscal space for
investment in climate change resilience. Given the volatility of fishing license fees, targeting a
structural balance would help reduce procyclicality—the structural balance is estimated on the basis

There may also be an adverse growth impact from the vulnerability to natural disasters. See Cabezon et al (2015), Enhancing
Macroeconomic Resilience to Natural Disasters and Climate Change in the Small States of the Pacific, IMF WP No 15/125; and

of a moving average of fishing license fees. In an adjustment scenario targeting a small structural
surplus (around 1 percent of GDP), recurrent spending is rationalized (including public enterprise
subsidies and social spending), which will ensure adequate CIF buffers (16 percent of the maintained
value of the TTF). The adjustment scenario includes the cost of climate change investment, as in the
baseline scenario. The adjustment scenario entails reversing part of the recent recurrent spending
increases through civil service wage restraint, scaling back the government subsidies (TMTS,
scholarships and PEs) as well as goods and services purchases. With a small structural surplus over
the medium to long run, CIF buffers would be maintained at a comfortable level, and debt indicators
would improve significantly (see discussion in paragraph 17 of the Staff Report).

C. Authorities’ View
9.
The authorities broadly concurred with the overall assessment of the DebtSustainability Analysis, but made a couple of observations. First, the authorities, while
recognizing the volatility of fishing revenues, are more optimistic about the near-term outcome, and
expect revenues to be higher than staff projection in the next few years. Second, they indicated that
the larger of the two fishing joint ventures has remained profitable, and the probability for the
government to assume the company’s debt obligation is small.

D. Conclusions
10.
Tuvalu’s DSA points to a high risk of debt distress, which is the same conclusion that
was drawn in the 2014 DSA. Under the baseline scenario, the budget would move into a deficit
from 2016 onwards as spending is not sufficiently scaled back in the context of normalizing
revenues. In the medium term, public and external debt-to-GDP levels fall below the indicative
thresholds but would breach the thresholds again in the long run once the CIF balance falls below
prudent levels and external borrowing is renewed. The debt trajectory highlights the importance of
targeting a small structural fiscal surplus to lower the risk of debt distress while maintaining fiscal
space to improve climate change resilience.
11.
Stress tests show that Tuvalu’s external and public sector debt dynamics are
susceptible to shocks. Standard shocks in DSA, particularly one-time 30 percent nominal
depreciation and slowing growth and exports, would cause certain external debt indicators to
breach their respective thresholds for prolonged periods. Public debt indicators also worsen
dramatically under bound tests.

2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; drawdowns of the CIF; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate
changes.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; drawdowns of the CIF; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate
changes.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

WORLD BANK-IMF COLLABORATION
The Bank and the Fund teams maintain a close working relationship and have an ongoing
dialogue on macroeconomic and structural issues. Since Tuvalu’s decision to pursue membership
of the Bretton Woods institutions in 2009, the Bank team has joined all IMF missions to Tuvalu since
the country’s membership mission, including the Article IV missions. The teams agreed that Tuvalu’s
main macroeconomic challenges are to ensure fiscal sustainability, strengthening public service
delivery, and create a more supportive environment for development. Based on this shared
assessment, the teams identified the following structural reform areas, all of which are also addressed
in the authorities’ reform plan, as macro-critical:


Strengthening fiscal buffers. In the absence of its own currency and monetary policy, sound
fiscal policy is key to maintaining macroeconomic stability. Maintenance of buffer assets is key to
ensuring sustainability. Maintaining adequate buffer assets will require sound fiscal policy
including saving of cyclical revenues and expenditure restraint, including containing wage bill
pressures. Moreover, there remains room to improve public financial management as well as
strengthen public sector management to improve budget execution and effectiveness in public
resource utilization.



Adapting and responding to climate change. Tuvalu is one of the countries to be most affected
by climate change and rising sea levels. In this context, climate change can lead to both structural
and cyclical fiscal costs. To this end, explicitly recognizing the adaptation and response cost in
budget will help ensure the continuity and efficiency on both spending and funding fronts.
However, donor financing will remain important in enhancing the country’s ability to cope with
natural disasters and climate change, given that the total costs may be too high for small states
like Tuvalu to fully internalize by building buffers.



Exploring opportunities for poverty reduction, job creation, and private sector
development. Tuvalu’s geographic isolation, small size, and poor land quality have made it
challenging to generate domestic private sector employment. Adequate education and training
need to be provided for Tuvaluans to better utilize overseas job opportunities and to reduce rising
poverty. Strengthening oversight on the financial sector will also facilitate improved access to
finance and private sector activities.



Strengthening public service delivery. The Government of Tuvalu in the Te Kakeega III and the
medium term reform agenda identified improving service delivery in the health and education
sectors as key objectives. Based on earlier analysis and sector strategic plans, the Government is
continuing reforms to improve allocative and technical efficiency as well as to ensure sector
financing sustainability.

The teams expect to sustain the close cooperation going forward. Attachment 1 details the specific
activities implemented and planned by the two teams over the period 2016 to 2018.

RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
Partnerships
ADB has been working with Tuvalu since 1993 and has approved 3 loans totaling $7.8 million, 4
program grants totaling $9.59 million, and over 22 technical assistance projects totaling $7.72
million, largely supporting public sector management, education, and maritime transport sectors.
Cumulative disbursements to Tuvalu for lending and grants, financed by ordinary capital resources,
the Asian Development Fund, and other special funds amount to $15.5 million.
ADB’s approach and operations in Tuvalu are aligned to Tuvalu’s eighth national development plan,
the National Strategy for Sustainable Development (Te Kakeega III), 2016–2020. ADB’s operational
focus over the medium term supports the Te Kakeega III’s cross-cutting objectives of Infrastructure
and Support Services; the Economy, Growth and Stability; Environment, and Climate Change. These
strategic priorities are in line with ADB’s corporate strategy 2020.
ADB, together with development partners, remain committed to supporting government’s roadmap
for improving the management of public resources, exercising prudent public expenditure and fiscal
management, strengthening corporate governance, and delivering better public services to the
people of Tuvalu.
ADB participates as a team member of the International Monetary Fund Article IV Mission to Tuvalu,
and liaises closely with the Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre—particularly on
macroeconomic management and fiscal conditions.
ADB observes the biannual meetings of the Tuvalu Trust Fund Board and cooperates with civil
society organizations in Tuvalu to strengthen the effectiveness, quality, and sustainability of its
services.
ADB is also committed to undertaking joint missions with development partners to improve
coordination and lessen demands on country capacity.
ADB Supported Projects and Programs
The government embarked on a comprehensive reform program from 2012 to 2015 implemented
through technical assistance and a coordinated program of flexible budget support grants provided
by ADB, the governments of Australia and New Zealand, and the World Bank. Collaborative efforts
towards improved governance, social development, education and human resources, and
macroeconomic growth and stability helped mitigate the social and economic impact of the global
financial crisis and strengthened Tuvalu’s fiscal sustainability against future shocks.
ADB provided grants in 2008, 2012, and 2015, totaling $7.6 million, towards sound macroeconomic
and fiscal management and improved public enterprise performances. The latest grant of $2.0
million, approved in September 2015, completed the final set of reforms begun with ADB support in

2012. Public procurement reforms supported by ADB have resulted in competition among suppliers,
cost-savings, transparent procurement proceedings, and improved public confidence in the use of
public finances. Reforms to contract out selected construction works currently undertaken by the
Public Works Department and privatize the government-owned hotel will help reduce the drain
from ad hoc government subsidies on the national budget, attract greater private sector
participation, and generate employment. Improvements to the management and maintenance of
government’s fiscal buffer fund will help ensure long-term macroeconomic stability and economic
self-sufficiency.
ADB approved preparatory work in July 2015 for the proposed Outer Island Maritime Infrastructure
Project, which will rehabilitate and improve maritime infrastructure in selected outer islands of
Tuvalu; and improve safety, efficiency, and sustainability of maritime transportation between
Funafuti and the eight outer islands. This investment project, likely to cost around $25 million, is
expected to be approved in late 2016.
ADB technical assistance has supported public financial management, governance, education, and
capacity development in Tuvalu. Tuvalu also benefitted from regional technical assistance in
economic management, audit capacity, aviation safety, private sector development, infrastructure
planning, climate change, and safeguards.
Future Directions
The introduction of a base annual allocation of $3.0 million for small developing member countries
from January 2015, which will double to $6.0 million in 2017, has boosted ADB’s scope for
investment opportunities in Tuvalu.
In mid-March 2015, tropical cyclone Pam caused significant damage to agriculture and
infrastructure, estimated at over $15.0 million. The government is seeking contributions from
development partners for prioritized interventions in the Tuvalu Recovery and Vulnerability
Reduction Plan, which requires over $70.0 million to implement. Towards this objective, ADB will
seek approval for the proposed Outer Island Maritime Infrastructure Project in 2016.
Over the medium term, ADB’s focus on the transport sector and strengthening public sector
management will help improve the efficiency and safety of outer island transportation through
upgraded port facilities and help sustain good fiscal management. Regional approaches to
information and communication technology, disaster risk management, and climate change will be
explored.

PFTAC COUNTRY STRATEGY 2012-2016
Background
Tuvalu's strong fishing and .tv revenues during the past 3 years have allowed it to overcome
some of the difficulties created by the earlier global financial crisis. The short-term outlook
appears stable on the back of continued favorable fishing and .tv revenues as well as large donorfinanced investments, but vulnerabilities in the state owned enterprises and financial sector continue
to pose challenges to macro stability.
PFTAC Technical Assistance (TA) has been moderate and concentrated in the revenue and
statistics sectors. Recent PFTAC TA has been focused on assisting the authorities achieve the gains
planned from revenue reforms through on-the-job assistance in revenue administration following
the completion of an ADB project that supported the PFTAC-designed reforms. There has also been
significant assistance in developing national accounts and balance of payments statistics, in part to
allow Tuvalu to meet the requirements of IMF membership. PFTAC provided TA in 2012 to develop
a PFM Reform Roadmap.
Strategy 2012-2016
PFTAC’s TA strategy is guided by the APD regional strategy note and is planned within the results
framework for the current PFTAC funding cycle.
PFTAC TA aims to support the authorities sustain progress on improving fiscal sustainability.
PFTAC will continue to work closely with the broader development partner group to ensure
coherence and will aim to support implementation of actions in the authorities’ shared policy matrix.
In the Public Financial Management area, PFTAC provided support in 2012 to develop a PFM
roadmap to prioritize the strengthening of PFM weaknesses identified in the 2011 PEFA (1.2).
Support to implementation of specific elements will also be available, in coordination with other
development partners and in particular the Australian Agency for International Development or
AusAID -supported budget and treasury advisors. In 2014 PFTAC provided TA to rewrite Tuvalu's
Financial Instructions, and worked with Ministry of Finance officials in 2015 to conduct a PEFA SelfAssessment and revise their 2011 Roadmap. The Self-Assessment identified many improvements
since the 2011 PEFA. Officials from Tuvalu have regularly attended PFTAC’s PFM workshops
including the most recently delivered (with PFTAC's Macro-Fiscal Advisor) on medium-term
expenditure forecasting. In the PFM area PFTAC anticipates continuing collaboration with the
Australia-Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade funded Budget Advisor to assist Tuvalu staff in
their development of medium-term budget planning and forecasting, including planning for asset
repair/replacement financing.

In the revenue area, The Pacific Technical Assistance Mechanism (PACTAM)1 has supported Tuvalu’s
Inland Revenue Department with a three year placement of a revenue advisor thus reducing reliance
on PFTAC TA. The main objectives of PACTAM’s TA package included: (a) providing on-the-job training
in tax audit; (b) strengthening debt and returns management; and (c) mentoring and advising the
Director of Inland Revenue by providing technical tax advice. Indications are that good progress has
been made to the extent that PACTAM recently scaled down its TA package from a full time advisor
to quarterly short term expert visits. To obtain an objective and independent view of how far the
organization has progressed its modernization journey the authorities have requested a PFTAC review
to provide an assessment of current revenue administration performance and to help identify future
reform priorities.
In statistics, PFTAC resumed the provision of regular assistance on national accounts compilation
(4.1), taking over from the SPC which has been doing this since 2010. PFTAC carried out national
accounts TA missions in February 2015 and January 2016 to help incorporate major administrative
and survey data sources, improve methods and build capacity. However, the latter has been
hampered by staff absence and with the sole compiler now embarking on long-term study leave, the
productive outlook is uncertain. PFTAC originally provided support on balance of payments
compilation) but this was then covered by the Japan Administered Account for Selected IMF
Activities or JSA Project on the Improvement of External Sector Statistics in the Asia and Pacific
Region, which formally concluded in October 2015. Further discussion is required to scope out how
such support might be provided from now on.
In financial sector supervision, PFTAC provided strategic support to the authorities by
reviewing the Banking Commissions Act and making some recommendations as to changes to
the oversight authority, which were accepted and in 2015 the Act was amended. The Banking
Commission and Banking Commissioner’s position remain, however if no one is appointed the
Minister of Finance will be the Commissioner or someone appointed by him. The Minister exercised
his prerogative and appointed the Permanent Secretary who will also hold the Banking
Commissioner’s position. PFTAC staged two TA missions to Tuvalu in 2015 to review and assess the
banking sector.
Given the lack of in country capacity, establishing a basic on and off site supervision office will be
problematic and will require TA resources. PFTAC did draft a basic set of prudential reporting and
held a few workshops with the Ministry of Finance and local bank on how to implement this
approach. A follow-up TA to the Ministry of Finance aimed at performing an on-site review of the
Bank of Tuvalu and requiring, on a regular basis, the reporting of financial data would be the next
step.
No direct macroeconomic support is currently envisaged, with the TTFAC and ADB’s Public
Expenditure Management TA currently taking the lead in these areas.
The Pacific Technical Assistance Mechanism (PACTAM), an Australian Government initiative, places highly skilled
employees in the Pacific to assist local employers to meet their human resource needs and contribute to developing
capacity in the workplace.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of August 1, 2016)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provided to the Fund have serious shortcomings that significantly hamper surveillance.
Shortcomings are most serious in the national accounts and monetary statistics. The Pacific Financial
Technical Assistance Centre (PFTAC) and the Statistics Department (STA) have provided technical
assistance (TA) to the Central Statistics Division (CSD) of the Ministry of Finance to help compiling
statistics for surveillance and the authorities’ own policy analysis and formulation. The CSD will need to
train additional staff to improve data provisioning.
National accounts: With PFTAC assistance, the compilation methodology for the national accounts is
gradually improving. Attention needs to be paid to improving source data for national accounts.
Price statistics: The consumer price index (CPI) is the only price index compiled in Tuvalu. The CSD
produces a quarterly CPI, which is timely and of reasonable quality. The CPI expenditure weights were
revised in 2011, based on the 2010 Household Income and Expenditure Survey. Ideally, weights should
be not more than five years old so as to ensure that the index remains representative of current
expenditure patterns.
Government finance statistics (GFS): Tuvalu neither compiles nor publishes GFS data. However, MOF
issue monthly fiscal statements (of central government data) for budget analysis and control, and apply
IPSAS (cash) and IFRS (accrual) accounting standards for all public sector entities. However, the
classifications of some accounts, particularly on capital spending, need to be improved to be in line
with international standards. Previous TA compiled draft GFS and Classification of the Functions of
Government (COFOG) tables for budgetary central government. Follow on steps were automation
within the financial accounting system; and collection of source data to fill existing data gaps in debt
and aid data. Staff resource levels remain an impediment to efficient and effective GFS data
compilation.
Monetary and financial statistics: Tuvalu uses the Australian dollar as its legal tender and does not
have a central bank. Monetary and financial statistics are currently not produced in Tuvalu. The National
Bank of Tuvalu and the Development Bank of Tuvalu provided the Article IV mission with their balance
sheets, which were used to produce the monetary data on the two banks.
Financial sector surveillance:
Financial Soundness Indicators (FSIs): Tuvalu does not compile FSIs.

TUVALU

Balance of payments and International Investment Position (IIP): Tuvalu’s External Sector Statistics
(ESS) has been considerably improved with the IMF TA under the recently ended JSA Project on the
Improvement of ESS in the Asia and Pacific Region. Balance of payments and international investment
position data are compiled annually following the BPM6. However, compilation of the ESS data are not
regular due to heavy dependency on the lone CSD compiler and need to streamlined. With regard to
quality of the data, shortcomings still remain in the coverage of nonfinancial private sector, FDI, exports,
and debt-related transactions and positions.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Tuvalu began participating in the General Data
Dissemination System (GDDS) in 2013 and joined
the enhanced GDDS (e-GDDS) as of May 2015.

No data ROSC are available.

III. Reporting to STA
Annual balance of payments and IIP statements, both in BPM6 format, were submitted to STA in May
2014 for the first time.

Statement by Barry Sterland, Executive Director for Tuvalu
and Sardor Sagdullayev, Advisor to Executive Director
September 12, 2016

Our Tuvaluan authorities thank the IMF team for the constructive dialogue, engaging policy
discussions and comprehensive assessment of the challenges facing the Tuvaluan economy.
The authorities broadly agree with the staff’s assessment of policy challenges and responses.
We would like to convey our Tuvaluan authorities’ appreciation to the Fund and
development partners for their continuous support. The authorities look forward to continued
close engagement with the IMF.
Tuvalu is the Fund’s smallest member with a population of around 10,000. It is one of the
most remote countries in the world with nine island atolls covering a total land area of only
26 square km and spreading over 900,000 square km of exclusive economic zone. Because of
its small population, Tuvalu has a small domestic market with little potential for economies
of scale, limited infrastructure, and expensive international market access. As a result, there
are limited business opportunities in the domestic economy and there is poor absorptive
capacity for major investment. There is also limited potential for the tourism sector to grow
as international flights are expensive and there are currently only two per week. Tuvalu’s
dependence on foreign aid and assistance is significant. Increased competitiveness in the
global labor market has seen a decline in the overseas employment of Tuvalu nationals,
which has affected the flow of remittances. The public sector, including public enterprises,
dominates Tuvalu’s economy. Tuvalu is at the forefront of the effects of climate change and
sea level rise with the highest point estimated to be about three meters above sea level. The
country is already vulnerable to natural disasters and was severely impacted by Cyclone Pam
in March 2015.
Despite these challenges, the authorities are committed to pushing forward a strong
development agenda. In November 2015 they adopted Te Kakeega III, the national strategy
for sustainable development for 2016-2020, which is aligned with the UN Sustainable
Development Agenda. This national development plan focuses on twelve strategic areas
including climate change, governance, economic growth, the private sector, employment,
health and social development. The authorities are also committed to continuing their efforts
to build adequate policy buffers to enhance economic resilience alongside continued
assistance from the international community.
Economic Outlook
The authorities agree with the staff’s assessment of the outlook and risks. Recent economic
performance has been strongly affected by Cyclone Pam which is estimated to have cost
around 33 percent of GDP. Expansionary fiscal policy and the implementation of large

2
infrastructure projects in 2016, including recovery spending following the cyclone, is
expected to boost growth to about 4 percent, compared to 2.6 percent in 2015.
Inflation has moved up slightly from 2 percent in 2014 to over 3 percent in 2015, in light of
the pickup in economic activity, increased government expenditures and a weaker Australian
dollar. The balance of payments position remains in surplus, driven by stronger fishing and
Internet revenues, while gross official reserves are expected to remain at around seven
months of imports.
While the medium-term growth outlook for the Tuvaluan economy is expected to be positive,
downside risks to the economy remain. These stem from the country’s geographical position,
heavy dependence on foreign aid and fishing revenue, and banking and fiscal vulnerabilities.
The authorities do, however, see upside risks from fishing license fees.
Fiscal policy
The Tuvalu authorities are committed to maintaining a responsible fiscal policy while also
meeting critical social and developmental expenditures. Since Tuvalu uses the Australian
dollar as legal tender and has no central bank, macroeconomic management largely relies on
fiscal policy. The fiscal situation has significantly improved in the last three-to-four years as
record high fishing license revenues and grants from development partners have underpinned
revenue. As a result, Tuvalu achieved its fourth consecutive year of fiscal surplus in 2015,
boosting the Consolidated Investment Fund (CIF) which serves as a fiscal buffer.
The authorities plan to use the CIF resources to finance revenue shortfalls over the next few
years. The CIF has some capacity, although the authorities recognize the need to contain
expenditure growth and will carefully consider a range of options to do so (including those
outlined by staff).
Reform of public enterprises remains a key priority for the Government, which is seeking to
limit subsidies. This is part of an overall strategy to increase the role of the private sector as a
generator of jobs and source of growth.
Our authorities agree that investments in climate resilience are a key priority for the budget.
They have established the Tuvalu Survival Fund (TSF) to finance recovery and rehabilitation
from climate change impacts and disasters, and to make investments in mitigation and
adaptation projects. It is expected that building resilience against climate change will require
Tuvalu to invest around 2 percent of GDP annually to climate-proof critical infrastructure.
The authorities welcome international support through the Green Climate Fund and will
continue to seek support for climate adaptation expenditures from the international
community.

3
Financial Sector
The authorities agree with staff that further progress is needed to strengthen supervisory and
regulatory frameworks in the banking sector. With the help of development partners and
PFTAC, they recently made amendments to the Banking Commission Act 2011 to improve
onsite supervision and increase its effectiveness. The authorities also achieved progress in
reducing non-performing loans, but acknowledge that more needs to be done. Given limited
infrastructure in the banking sector (there is no ATM in the country, for example), financial
services are restricted to a small number of people and the access of outer islanders is
constrained. The authorities are mindful of capacity constraints and would be grateful for
additional technical or financial assistance from the Fund and development partners to
strengthen the financial system.
Structural Reforms
The authorities are committed to pursuing structural reforms, especially of public enterprises.
The Public Sector Reform Committee is currently working with technical assistance to
improve public sector efficiency in order to provide more timely, reliable and quality public
services at an affordable cost. At the same time, the authorities acknowledge the urgency of
future reforms to the SOE sector and will continue to explore ways to strengthen public
enterprises in order to improve their governance, administration and profitability.
The authorities are committed to meeting international standards and strengthening their
AML/CFT regime. They also acknowledge the need to meet the standards required by the
Fund in terms of data quality and availability. However, capacity constraints and a shortage
of qualified staff are hindering improvements in the quality of statistics. Nevertheless, the
authorities are committed to cooperating closely with PFTAC and staff to address this issue.
