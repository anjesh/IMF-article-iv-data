STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
April 18, 2013

KEY ISSUES
Context and political setting
Economic activity recovered in 2012, reflecting a more moderate decline in oil output and
continued strong non-oil growth, supported by government spending. Inflation reached
record lows but overheating risks are increasing as a result of expansionary policy.
Presidential elections are scheduled for October 2013.

Focus of consultation and recommendations
The overarching challenge for Azerbaijan, amid an environment of high oil prices but with a
foreseeable decline in oil production, is to transform oil revenue into productive assets to
generate sustainable and broad-based private sector-led growth in a way that is consistent
with macroeconomic stability and absorptive capacity constraints. Staff recommends:



Embarking on an up-front fiscal consolidation to pursue a sustainable non-oil fiscal
position and provide room for private sector activity. This requires efforts to cut
public spending, especially on investment, while improving its efficiency;



Shifting to a more neutral monetary policy stance, ending the CBA’s role in direct
lending to the real sector, and preparing, in coordination with government
agencies, for greater exchange rate flexibility over the long term;



Capitalizing the banking system while strengthening supervisory safeguards, with a
focus on restructuring the operations of IBA in line with international best practice;



Promoting diversification by easing the entry and exit of companies in the non-oil
sector, reducing corruption, improving access to finance, enacting a code of
competition, and completing WTO accession.

Previous Consultation
During the 2011 Article IV consultation, Directors stressed the need to (i) unwind countercyclical
policies adopted during the 2009 global crisis; (ii) delink fiscal policy from the global oil price
cycle; (ii) strengthen the monetary policy framework; (iii) improve competition in the banking
system; and (iv) enhance the business climate to achieve economic diversification. Though there
has been little progress in unwinding countercyclical policies adopted during the 2009 global
crisis and delinking fiscal policy from the global oil price cycle, the authorities have prepared an
action plan with IMF TA to move towards greater exchange rate flexibility over the long term;
adopted measures to increase competition in the banking system and some prudential
regulations; and launched initiatives to further improve the business climate.

BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT
1.
Using the oil revenue, Azerbaijan’s economy
has been one of the world’s fastest growing over
the last decade and fared well through the 2009
global crisis. Since the start of the boom, real GDP
growth averaged over 13 percent annually, GDP per
capita increased by six fold to nearly $6,000 by 2012,
and poverty fell rapidly. The economy’s reliance on oil
is large: about 45 percent of GDP, over 70 percent of
fiscal revenue, and 92 percent of exports. 1

2.
Yet the country is at a critical juncture given the foreseeable decline in oil production
and gas reserves amounting to only about 1/3 of oil wealth.2 The current high oil prices provide
an opportune environment to advance the 2020 government strategy for sustainable, broad-based
and private sector led growth. The strategy would need to be underpinned by:


Strong frameworks for conducting macro- economic policies, and careful management of the
policy mix;



A deep and efficient financial sector; and



A favorable environment for private sector activity.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS, OUTLOOK, AND RISKS
3.
Near-term economic prospects are generally positive, albeit with an increasing risk of
overheating:


With strong growth of 9.6 percent, the non-oil output reached its potential last year and will
remain near 9 percent in 2013, supported by public spending. Oil output is likely to drop
in 2013 for a third year in a row, albeit at a slower pace, but should increase slightly next year
with new well deliveries. Overall GDP growth is expected at 4 percent in 2013.

In this note oil refers to oil and gas, except when discussing the oil production horizon, which only pertains to the
oil sector. Oil reserves are expected to be depleted in 15-20 years. Sources: British Petroleum (BP) Statistical Review
of World Energy, June 2012, and discussions with BP staff in the field. For a discussion of the factors behind the
marked decrease in the poverty rate (including gains in employment, wages and productivity, and social transfers),
see IMF reports for the 2011 Article IV Consultation with the Republic of Azerbaijan (IMF country reports 12/05 and
12/06).

Major reasons behind the depletion of oil reserves are the age of the oil fields and limited investment in the oil
sector.



Inflation dropped sharply to an average of 1.1 percent in 2012, mainly reflecting the impact of
global and domestic food price trends. But with the non-oil economy hitting capacity constraints
and expansionary fiscal policy, headline inflation is projected to reach 7 percent by end-year,
above the CBA’s 5–6 percent target range, for an annual average of 3½ percent.



The de facto exchange rate regime is classified as a stabilized arrangement, and the manat
exchange rate has appreciated by less than 2 percent since November 2010 through the CBA’s
intervention.



Fiscal policy. The non-oil fiscal primary deficit in percent of non-oil GDP—which has persistently
been above the 35 percent implied by the permanent income rule—could increase from an
estimated 45 percent in 2012 to 47 percent in 2013 with a full execution of the 2013 budget. The
planned spending will significantly raise the break-even oil price and worsen fiscal sustainability.
Parliament recently enacted some amendments to the tax code aimed mainly at fostering the
non-oil sector development. The fiscal cost of 0.2–0.3 percent of GDP is likely to be offset
through better tax enforcement enabled by the newly introduced online filing and auditing.3



Monetary policy has turned expansionary, with two 250 basis point cuts in the benchmark
refinancing rate since December 2012. Monetary transmission through policy rates is somewhat
weak in the absence of well-developed money and bond markets. The availability of securities
for conducting monetary policy is also limited.



Financial indicators of the banking system excluding the International Bank of Azerbaijan (IBA)
have deteriorated somewhat, particularly those associated with capitalization, liquidity, and
profitability. While disclosed nonperforming loans (NPL) figures are still relatively low, they may
be understated as only the overdue portion of principal and interest is reported as NPL. The
largest bank, IBA, is in need of restructuring and received state support of ½ percent of GDP
in 2012 to alleviate shortages in capital and liquidity, without any conditions. With a view to
fostering consolidation and competition in banking system, the CBA increased the minimum
capital requirements for banks fivefold (to $63 million, well above the Basel requirements) to be
effective in 2014. An FSAP update is now scheduled for early 2014.

3

Main amendments include the adoption of a 7-year-long income tax exemption for residents in new industrial and
technological parks to foster the non-oil sector development; a cut in the maximum personal income tax rate from
30 per cent to 25 per cent; and an increase in the maximum monthly taxable income bracket from 2000 to 2500
manat (that had been kept at this level since 2008).

1/ Excludes restructured loans. Impaired loans ratio are higher under IFRS.
2/ Disclosed NPLs are somewhat underestimated, as only the overdue portion of principal and interest is disclosed as NPL.

4.
The baseline scenario demonstrates that continuing with current policies would
exacerbate fiscal vulnerabilities and further deter private sector investment. Oil dependence
and fiscal vulnerabilities are rapidly increasing as reflected in the rising break-even oil price and oil
fund transfers to the budget. The government’s planned large public investment program, including
in the 2013 budget, would maintain the non-oil primary deficit in percent of non-oil GDP well above
the sustainable 35 percent level over the near term. This would severely limit the ability of the
government to conduct near-term countercyclical fiscal policy. Implementing such plans could also
result in overheating pressures and undermine the credibility of the government’s goal of achieving
fiscal sustainability by 2018. In the absence of structural reforms and substantial improvements in
public investment management, the spending plans could also heighten concerns over efficiency
(Box 1), exacerbate the vulnerability of public finances, and lead to a substantial drawdown of
buffers against external shocks.
5.
In the staff-recommended scenario, more prudent macro policies would tackle fiscal
vulnerabilities and pave the way for economic diversification. Up-front fiscal consolidation,
primarily by scaling down government spending, would still provide space for an ample level of
public investment—above the average for developing economies. With a more credible mediumterm fiscal consolidation path and structural reforms on the business environment, governance, and
trade, non-oil sector growth would exceed that in the baseline scenario over the medium term.4

4

Relative to the recommended staff scenario in the previous consultation, the current staff scenario factors in a
considerable increase in the public investment program over 2012–13 and assumes that near-term deviations from
the non-oil fiscal deficit benchmark of 35 percent under the permanent income rule would not all be offset before
2018.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF AZERBAIJAN

6.
Risks to the baseline scenario are tilted to the downside (Annex 1). Loose fiscal policy, a
disorderly consolidation of the banking sector capital increase, and a delayed IBA restructuring
would undermine prospects for reducing vulnerabilities and fostering sustainable growth. A fall in oil
prices, triggered by trade spillovers resulting from an intensification of the recession in the euro
area, is also a key risk. Direct exposure of the financial sector to euro area developments is mainly
through assets of the oil fund. Regional conflicts, including increasing tensions over NagornoKarabakh, could affect the country’s ability to attract non-oil FDI. The authorities agreed with the
general assessment of risks to the medium-term outlook.

Box 1. Azerbaijan: The Level and Efficiency of Public Investment
The rapid increase in public investment may not have made a large development impact. The oil boom
has enabled public investment levels, relative to GDP, that are as twice the average for resource rich
developing countries (RRDC). Efficient use of public spending requires both investment within absorptive
constraints and well-developed public financial management frameworks, but these are weak in Azerbaijan,
particularly in investment project appraisals and selection. Moreover, rent seeking weakens the marginal
impact of public investment, which is suggested by large infrastructure gaps in key services such as roads,
water, and electricity relative to other RRDCs and the Caucasus and Central Asia (CCA) region (see Appendix II
on Stylized Facts on the Azerbaijan Economy).

PAVING THE WAY FOR A DIVERSIFIED ECONOMY
A. Entrenching Fiscal Discipline
7.
A gradual fiscal tightening would reduce vulnerabilities and promote a self-sustaining
expansion of private-sector activity. Fiscal consolidation of 4 percent of non-oil GDP over 2013–
14 is achievable if potential pressures for a mid-year supplementary budget are resisted and public
investment is brought to levels consistent with macro stability and absorptive constraints. A more
moderate investment path could support sustainable growth as suggested by the IMF Sustainable
Investing Tool (Box 2). Ensuring that recent tax code amendments do not result in increased evasion,
strengthening the appraisal and selection of investment projects in line with best practice,
monitoring and containing fiscal risks arising from state-owned enterprises and IBA, and advancing

a sound pension reform in line with recent IMF technical assistance advice will be crucial to preserve
the consolidation efforts.5
8.
The authorities agreed that the non-oil deficit is unsustainable, but considered it
infeasible to start consolidation in the near term. They saw rationalizing public investment as the
main way to consolidate the non-oil fiscal position. But given existing large investment
commitments (including projects by the oil company considered as a priority), they did not see the
consolidation starting before 2015.

resources from a potential fuel subsidy reform to better

10.
The authorities expressed interest in strengthening the fiscal framework to entrench
fiscal discipline. They agreed on the need to prioritize and evaluate public investment, with World
Bank support, to ensure efficiency. They also expressed willingness in developing a medium-term
technical assistance program with the IMF to strengthen the fiscal framework and the public
financial management system.

Despite reforms to the pension system in 2006 and 2010, the pension system is not financially sustainable and its
dependence on annual transfers from the budget has been steadily increasing over time (the deficit before budget
transfers was about 4 percent of GDP in 2012). Reforming the system entails rationalizing the basic pension;
restructuring the notional defined-contributions; separating contributions for old-age and disability benefits; and
adopting a well-designed transition process and a plan for financing the residual unfunded liabilities.

Box 2. Azerbaijan: An Application of the Sustainable Investing Tool 1/ 2/
The IMF Sustainable Investing tool was applied to Azerbaijan to analyze fiscal strategies that could
better support the transformation of oil windfalls into long-term sustainable economic growth. The
model—part of the IMF recent guidance for resource-rich developing countries (RRDC)—mainly captures
two channels to induce higher non-oil GDP with higher public capital. First, high public capital raises the
marginal productivity of private production factors. Higher productivity of these inputs “crowd in” private
investment and output. Second, higher productivity raises households’ income and private consumption.
Two fiscal approaches are analyzed under two scenarios of oil prices (WEO prices and an alternative
scenario that subjects oil prices to large negative shocks between 2015–17):
•
The dissaving approach that keeps public investment at a very high level to a rapid buildup public
capital. Public investment eventually winds down as the oil fund gradually depletes.
•
The sustainable investing approach that enables public investment at moderate levels while
sustaining the policy of saving some oil revenues in the oil fund.
The results suggest that the dissaving approach can outperform the sustainable investing approach in
the near term but not without costs. This is provided that investment efficiency is not too low and public
capital is productive, since government spending is much higher with dissaving. In the long term, the results
suggest that the capital built with oil windfalls (and hence its growth benefits) may not be sustained and that
private capital will eventually decline.
Only under the sustainable investment approach can the growth benefits from investing oil windfalls
be sustained over time. Since the magnitude of investment path is rather moderate, investment efficiency
is higher because lower investment levels are less likely to bump into absorptive capacity constraints. The
continued savings of oil revenue in the oil fund helps support public investment spending, sufficient to cover
the recurrent capital costs, and ensure oil windfalls are converted into sustainable physical assets.
The benefits of sustainable investing are more discernible in the alternative scenario of a negative oil
prices shock. The oil fund serves as a buffer in supporting public investment, which prevents pro-cyclical
fiscal policy. With a more stable fiscal regime, the oil fund can help maintain macroeconomic stability from
the negative impact of volatile oil shocks and sustain both public and private capital and non-oil growth.

Box 3. Azerbaijan: Revamping The Fiscal Policy Framework1/
In line with recent IMF guidance for RRDC, a revamped fiscal framework—anchored on fiscal rules and
strong institutional arrangements—could boost the credibility in the Azerbaijani government’s ability to
achieve fiscal sustainability while dealing with the volatility and exhaustibility of oil resources. The RRDC
fiscal toolkit was applied to Azerbaijan to simulate the impact of different fiscal rules.
Options for the fiscal rule:
•
A traditional Permanent Income Hypothesis (PIH) rule would be the first choice for a fiscal
rule in Azerbaijan to anchor fiscal policy decisions. Consistent with recent IMF guidance for RRDC,
alternative PIH-based rules that allow a scaling up of expenditure such as the modified PIH (MPIH) or the
Fiscal Sustainability Framework (FSF) do not seem advisable for Azerbaijan at this stage for three main
reasons: (i) investment is already very high by developing country standards, and the authorities are thus
likely bumping into absorptive capacity constraints; (ii) growing concerns about the low growth impact of
government spending, given weaknesses in the management of investment programs and opportunities for
corruption; and (iii) increasing overheating risks as a result of the combined effect of a closed output gap
and expansionary fiscal policy as announced in the 2013 budget. The PIH, combined with an embedded
price-based rule, could help smooth the volatility of oil revenue.
•
Price-based rules could also help smooth spending, when combined with a structural primary
balance. But calibration will be needed to align the performance of the rule with the desired mix of
spending and savings.
Strong fiscal institutions should supplement the fiscal rule:
•
The PFM system should ensure the dissemination of the underlying non-oil fiscal position and
break-even oil price, main contingent liabilities, and fiscal risks;
•
A fiscal responsibility law could enforce fiscal decisions on a rules-based framework and help
guide the flows to the fund, with some recalibration allowed at the beginning of a new government term.
•
The oil fund (SOFAZ) could establish one portfolio per objective to increase the accountability
in the achievement of different objectives. Funding for infrastructure projects in the budget needs to consult
the available fiscal space, spending absorption capacity, and long-term sustainability. Investment could be
guided by an “infrastructure needs assessments” developed with developmental partners (e.g., WB or ADB).
Whatever rule the authorities select, it would be important to abide by the rule and advance reforms
to address the sustainability issues of the pension system and IBA.

B. Dealing with Inflation
11.
Shifting to a more neutral monetary policy stance in the near term, with a steady
policy rate and preparedness to tighten if price pressures intensify, would help keep inflation
within the CBA’s 5–6 percent target range. With the output gap closed, demand pressures are
rising as evidenced by the recent surge in non-food services and underlying inflation. Such
pressures are likely to be exacerbated by the strong pace in consumption credit to the private sector
and the expansionary 2013 approved budget. Though the monetary transmission mechanism is
relatively weak, further policy rate cuts could generate the possibility of a round of higher inflation.
12.
The CBA is ready to act if inflation threatens to rise above its 5–6 percent target range.
The CBA emphasized that the rapid fall in inflation in late 2012 provided room for loosening policy
and noted policy rate cuts were needed to help lower commercial banks’ lending rates, which can
exceed 20 percent. They noted their readiness to begin tightening monetary policy, if needed, this
year.
13.
Eliminating the CBA’s role in direct lending to the real economy would promote CBA’s
independence. Notwithstanding earlier plans to unwind lending to the real sector launched in
response to the 2009 global crisis, CBA’s net credit to state-owned enterprises surged in 2012. This
trend seems unjustified with the recovery in economic activity. The CBA should follow through on its
planned prudential measures to cool down the acceleration in consumer loans, namely increasing
the provisioning rate for non-performing loans in consumer lending and/or the coefficient of riskweighted assets of consumer loans in foreign exchange for calculation of capital adequacy ratios.
14.
While stressing the large import component and the short-term nature of the CBA’s
lending to the real sector, the authorities agreed on the need to stop this lending. The CBA
noted that because of the large import component of the spending financed with this lending, its
impact on aggregate demand is limited. They also reaffirmed their commitment to implement
recent CBA initiatives to contain the rapid growth of consumer lending.
15.
The authorities agreed that a more flexible exchange rate would enable a more
independent monetary policy and an additional tool to absorb shocks, particularly over the
long term as non-oil exports become more diversified. Very limited exchange rate flexibility may
be beneficial at early stages of development, but costs of this regime are likely to increase as
Azerbaijan diversifies and integrates with global financial markets, and faces the need to develop a
more independent monetary policy. Staff stressed that the introduction of greater flexibility needs to
be gradual and follow the implementation of pre-conditions and reforms in foreign exchange
management and the monetary policy framework, as noted in the recent IMF technical assistance
advice (Box 4). Over the longer term, plans to abandon the official exchange rate as the nominal
anchor and introduce a target band with an explicit intervention strategy would pave the way for
introducing inflation targeting as the main anchor for conducting monetary policy.

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF AZERBAIJAN

16.
The CBA reiterated its willingness to move toward greater exchange rate flexibility
over the longer term but emphasized this will require meeting the preconditions and
establishing strong cooperation among agencies. The mission provided an opportunity to
strengthen the direct dialog of the CBA with other agencies involved in this topic, namely the
ministry of finance and the oil fund. All of these entities were receptive to the staff’s proposal of
creating a high-level committee or consultative group to move forward the implementation of the
strategy developed with the support of IMF TA.
17.
Competitiveness of the non-oil economy is undermined mainly by lack of decisive
structural reforms and possibly some currency overvaluation. Staff estimates indicate that the
real effective exchange rate may be overvalued but the results are not conclusive. Priorities for
structural reforms are improving the business environment, deepening financial markets, and
reducing barriers to trade and competition, particularly for SMEs (See Box 5). The authorities agreed
that the ongoing government effort to improve the competitiveness of the non-oil sector is key to
diversification.
Box 4. Azerbaijan: Sequencing in Exchange Rate Flexibility1/
Moving to a more flexible exchange rate in Azerbaijan requires the sequencing of pre-conditions and
reforms in foreign exchange management and the monetary policy-setting framework. 2/ Crosscountry experience suggest that orderly and durable transitions from fixed to more flexible exchange rate
arrangements result from building this capacity, gradually introducing enhanced flexibility, and
implementing policies to mitigate risks. In this direction, the pace and intended sequencing of reform should
be clearly formulated and articulated to market
Exits by Exchange Rate Regime, 1990–2002
participants and the public.
140

In the short run, market participants could be
allowed to make FX trades at a progressively
wider and explicit band around the official
exchange rate, and a clear CBA intervention
strategy should be announced. This will help price
discovery, the monitoring of volatility, and the
building of trading capacity in the banking sector.
Systematic monitoring and forecasting liquidity and
BOP projections by the CBA and also the Public Debt
Management Agency and the Ministry of Finance will
be important.

Over the medium and longer terms, a market-oriented approach will need to be developed to
provide US dollars to the market. More commercial banks should be allowed to participate in the FX
market and the transparency of the State Oil fund’s role should be enhanced. Plans could then be
announced to abandon the official exchange rate and set up a target band with an explicit intervention
strategy while moving forward reforms that improve the transmission channel of monetary policy and the
secondary debt trading. Ultimately, this will allow the authorities to move away from the exchange rate as a
nominal anchor with the last stage objective of moving to inflation targeting.

Box 5. Azerbaijan: Exchange Rate, External Stability, and Competitiveness Assessment
The manat REER appreciated during the oil boom during 2004–8 and, though it has stabilized, there
are signs of an overvaluation yet the results are not conclusive. An assessment made with the
Macroeconomic Balance (MB) approach, based on current policies, indicates a roughly 15 percent
overvaluation. This is broadly corroborated by the external stability (ES) approach. Yet, these results cannot
be considered conclusive evidence of a loss of competitiveness as the reduced-form equilibrium real
exchange rate (ERER) finds a 10 percent undervaluation by estimating the equilibrium rate as a function of a
number of medium-term fundamentals.1/

C. Strengthening the Financial Sector to Support Diversification
18.
There was agreement that the ongoing capitalization process and ensuing
consolidation are an opportunity to create a more viable and competitive banking sector.
Ongoing CBA initiatives to strengthen corporate governance regulations, risk management
practices, and prudential regulations to contain consumer lending are well placed to help preserve
financial sector stability. To ensure the accurate classification of non-performing loans, with proper
loan-loss provisioning, such initiatives could be supplemented with strengthened supervisory
safeguards in line with international best practice. Approving a time-bound action plan—in line with
IMF advice—to guide, in particular, the capitalization, recording of NPLs, and potential merger and
acquisitions would be crucial to contain risks to financial stability in the system. While
acknowledging the importance of properly classifying NPLs, the authorities noted that their relevant
regulation provides for a comprehensive definition of NPLs.
19.
The authorities welcomed IMF technical assistance in this area. They appreciated
recommendations to contain risks to the capitalization process and agreed with the need to
implement government initiatives to strengthen the soundness of the overall system.
20.
With an unviable business model, the largest bank, IBA, needs major restructuring. An
unreformed IBA undermines the stability and efficiency of the banking system as it faces heavy risks
from large projects and could result in high costs for the shareholders, including the government.
Restructuring IBA in line with internationally accepted principles would pave the way for the
downsizing and transparent privatization of the bank in due course. This would entail a diagnostic
assessment of IBA by a reputable international institution or company, and containing external
borrowing until a viable business model is in place.6
21.
Efforts to strengthen capital markets with the support of the World Bank would
facilitate the financing of the non-oil sector. The authorities intend to develop the legal
framework, infrastructure, and instruments for savers and investors. The recent expansion of the
corporate bond market could help deepen the capital market but would need to be supplemented
with actions to strengthen the consolidated supervision of banks and their brokerage subsidiaries,
and develop an appropriate credit infrastructure. Staff also noted that the recent change in the
Commercial Secrets Law, discouraging the disclosure of shareholders of companies, is a step in the
wrong direction as it raises concerns about open competition for private sector activities and is
against international disclosure principles.
22.
The authorities noted that addressing IBA issues and developing capital markets will
require some time. Regarding IBA, they explained that actions to restructure this bank are
important but should be carefully planned and proceed at a slow pace given the systemic

importance of this bank. They also noted that strengthening the credit infrastructure would entail
coordinating the work of several agencies.

D. Advancing the Structural Reform Agenda to Promote Diversification
23.
The authorities agreed that the government’s 2020
strategy provides the platform for reforms in the business
environment that could promote non-oil exports. The “easy
service center” initiative (ASAN) has improved government
services and should be expanded while phasing out more
traditional and inefficient government services. E-government
initiatives have the potential to reduce opportunities for
corruption at the Ministry of Taxes and Customs but need to be
supplemented with the legalization of e-signature to be
effective. Improving structural policies and governance are
critical for fostering non-oil FDI and private sector-led growth.

The authorities saw recent measures to promote diversification as promising. In this area,
they noted that agro-industry, information technology, and tourism have potential to increase
diversification and highlighted improvements in Azerbaijan’s rankings, such as in the Global
Competitiveness Index.7 They also mentioned they are working on the introduction of e-signature in
due course. They noted that the move towards electronic activities and the new ASAN model were
considerably helping curb opportunities for corruption.
Reforms aimed at reducing informal and formal barriers to trade and competition would be
25.
crucial to promote a diversified and competitive economy. An independent international agency should
provide a public evaluation of the draft competition code ahead of its enactment. Also, accelerating plans
for WTO accession and the completion of regulations needed for the full implementation of the new
customs code would encourage private sector investment and speed up integration with global markets.
Substantial streamlining of government inspections, licenses, and permits—including for SMEs—could help
sharply reduce non-oil companies’ costs and opportunities for corruption (see Box 6).

26.
The authorities regarded the recent tax amendments and government spending, particularly
on infrastructure, as key actions to promote diversification. They noted recent amendments providing
incentives for the development of industrial parks have worked well in other countries. They also saw the
heavy public spending on infrastructure as critical to easing constraints on private investment and
developing the non-oil sector. There was agreement on the importance of containing potential evasion
arising from the new industrial parks, and also of advancing measures to ease barriers on trade and
competition.
7

Major drivers of the recent improvement in the latest World Economic Forum Global Competitiveness Index are
improvements in the efficiency of goods markets, the availability of advanced technologies, and the capacity for
innovation.

REPUBLIC OF AZERBAIJAN

Box 6. Azerbaijan: Business Environment and Governance
An improved business environment will be crucial for a sustainable diversification strategy anchored
on a strong role of external trade and a substantial reduction of the influence of public spending on
non-oil growth. Since the onset of the oil boom, government spending seems to be stimulating a large
share of non-oil private activities on services and construction. External non-oil trade has not been a driver
of non-oil growth and FDI remains highly concentrated on oil and gas sectors.
SMEs with substantial potential to support diversification and job creation are a much smaller
contributor to growth in Azerbaijan than in comparator countries. Their share in GDP has remained in
single digits, well below the average of more than 30–40 percent in Asian countries. Recent surveys by the
OECD and IFC find that SMEs in Azerbaijan face high costs associated with entry and exit procedures,
contract enforcement, government inspections, and property rights.
In round table discussions with IMF staff, private sector representatives and NGOs identified
problems with competition and trade barriers. There are formal and informal monopolies, corporate
governance problems, opportunities for corruption, and high cost of credit. The business community
stressed the need to enact and enforce e-signature and a good competition law, complete WTO accession,
and streamline government red tape, particularly for SMEs.

OTHER ISSUES
Data Provision to the Fund
27.
Timeliness of data provision to the Fund is broadly adequate for surveillance. Actions
are underway to bring fiscal and external sector statistics in line with international standards.
Sustained efforts are needed to strengthen data sharing among core government agencies and this
could entail a technical memorandum of understanding among agencies. There is also a need to
strengthen the production of statistics, particularly for GDP, fiscal accounts, and International
Investment Position in line with recent IMF technical assistance.

STAFF APPRAISAL
28.
Azerbaijan is at a critical juncture, and the authorities will need to make rapid progress
toward the government’s 2020 goal of making Azerbaijan a highly competitive economy. The
benefits from the oil boom are temporary given the relatively short oil reserve horizon. The current
high oil price presents an opportune environment to bring decisive changes in the current course of
economic policies to reduce reliance on natural resources and promote a more sustainable and
broad-based growth led by the private sector. Policy priorities are improving the efficiency of public
spending while reducing its size, strengthening the financial sector, and improving the business
climate, including by effectively implementing anti-corruption and anti-money laundering (AML)
measures.8
29.
A moderate upfront fiscal consolidation over 2013–14 would be manageable and
could provide an important signal of change in the current course of fiscal policy. The
government’s planned spending program, including in the 2013 budget, is exacerbating oil
dependence and increasing risks to a potential fall in global oil prices. The near-term fiscal position
envisaged in the authorities’ plans is also unsustainable over the longer term, given the short oil
profile horizon. Reducing fiscal vulnerabilities while promoting a self-sustaining expansion of
private-sector activity would thus require scaling down government spending, resisting pressures for
a mid-year supplementary budget, and guarding against evasion from recent tax amendments.
Lower government spending would support sustainable growth, particularly in the context of actions
that aim to improve the efficiency of public spending, prioritize investment projects, and enhance
the business climate for private sector activities.

8

Recent IMF Technical Assistance on the AML/CFT focused on banking supervision tools on this area, including a
risk-based supervision framework and on-site inspection procedures.

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF AZERBAIJAN

30.
A revamped fiscal policy framework could help achieve fiscal sustainability and
promote sound oil revenue management. A fiscal rule, along with the strengthening of supportive
fiscal institutions, could bring fiscal discipline particularly during time of high oil prices, and would
be crucial for Azerbaijan, given the relatively short oil reserve horizon. The new framework could
establish a policy of saving part of the oil revenue for macro stability and intergenerational equity
purposes. Against this background, the authorities’ intention to seek IMF technical assistance for
strengthening the fiscal framework and the public financial management system is welcome.
31.
The CBA should undertake monetary tightening if price pressures intensify. Now that
the impact of the 2009 global crisis has passed, the authorities would be well placed to eliminate the
CBA’s role in future direct lending to the real economy, which was meant to be temporary.
Implementing the planned prudential measures to cool down the acceleration in consumer loans
could help abate potential inflationary pressures while also contributing to financial sector stability.
32.
A move toward greater exchange rate flexibility could improve the economy’s ability
to absorb shocks, particularly over the long term as non-oil exports become more diversified. The
transition could be guided by recent IMF technical assistance in this area. But this move requires
political will of the leadership of the country and strong cooperation among key government
agencies. The creation of a high-level consultative group will be an important step in this regard.
33.
The ongoing capitalization provides an opportunity to create a more viable and
competitive banking sector. The success of this process hinges on decisive actions to strengthen
supervisory safeguards in line with international best practice. Developing a viable business model
for the largest bank, IBA, will also be key to promote the stability and efficiency of the banking
system. Efforts to strengthen capital markets, with the support of the World Bank, will also be crucial
to facilitate the financing of the non-oil sector.
34.
The long-run sustainability of the economy requires development of non-oil exports,
and the government’s 2020 strategy provides the platform for reforms to help achieve this
objective. The “easy service center” and e-government initiative (ASAN) have the potential to
reduce opportunities for corruption if supplemented with the legalization of e-signature. But
fostering non-oil domestic and foreign private investment will require reducing informal and formal
barriers to trade and competition, along with improvements in governance and rule of law.
35.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Azerbaijan will be held on the
standard 12-month cycle.

In light of Azerbaijan’s high
dependence on oil, the economy
could go into recession, though oil
fund savings could help cushion the
impact.
Medium/Low
A further deterioration of this bank

the banking system. Though the
government is likely to step in with
important fiscal costs.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most
likely to materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment
of the risks surrounding the baseline. The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern
as of the time of discussions with authorities.

Political and social unrest could
prompt populist measures and

Policy responses: With potential downside risks, staff will recommend that the authorities rebuild policy buffers.
This would entail strengthening the non-oil fiscal position during the present good times of high oil prices.
Enhancing banking supervision and speeding up plans to bring the public bank under a sustainable financial
position will also help contain risks in the financial sector. The room to relax monetary policy in response to a
domestic shock is closing, particularly after recent CBA actions.

APPENDIX III. DEBT SUSTATINABILITY ASSESSMENT

Box 1. Azerbaijan: External Debt Sustainability Assessment
External debt is low and risks of debt distress over the medium term are similarly low.
External debt has declined substantially since the onset of the oil boom, halving by 20 percentage points to
about 20 percent in 2011 relative to 2004. This reflects, in large part, rapid real GDP growth and the
government’s decision to finance domestic investment projects from oil revenue.
Under the baseline scenario, external debt is projected to decline slightly to about 15 percent of GDP
by 2017, mainly from increasing non-oil FDI (attracted by progress on structural reforms and strengthening
of the non-oil fiscal position).
Azerbaijan’s external debt appears resilient to most adverse external shocks.
Bound tests suggest that under standard shocks to interest rates, growth, and real exchange rate, external
debt will remain relatively low, at less than 25 percent of GDP by 2017.
External debt, however, could increase rapidly, to about 68 percent, if there were a standard shock to the
non-interest external current account.
If key variables, including real GDP growth and current account surplus, remain at the historical 10–year
average (14 percent and 10 percent of GDP, respectively), external debt would continue to decline rapidly
relative to the baseline scenario. But given the prospects for oil production and oil prices, this scenario is
unlikely.

Box 2. Azerbaijan: Public Debt Sustainability Assessment
Public debt is small, thus, risks of debt distress in the medium–term are low.
Public debt has declined substantially since the onset of the oil boom, halving to about 10 percent in 2011,
relative to 2004. As in the case of external debt, this reflects rapid real GDP growth and the government’s
decision to finance domestic investment projects from oil revenue.
Under the baseline scenario, public debt is projected to increase while remaining moderate at about
16 percent of GDP by 2017. The scenario assumes efforts to consolidate the non-oil fiscal position, reduced
spending on investment financed with oil resources, and some build up of domestic debt, consistent with
the objective of developing the capital markets.
Azerbaijan’s public debt appears resilient to most adverse shocks.
Bound tests suggest that under standard shocks to interest rates, primary balance, and real exchange rate,
public debt would remain relatively manageable at about 25 percent of GDP or less by 2017.
However, the public debt ratio seems more vulnerable to shocks to real growth than the external debt, as
under this bound test, public debt would rise to 52 percent by 2017.
If key variables, including real GDP growth and primary surplus, remain at the historical 10 year average
(14 percent and 6 percent of GDP, respectively), public debt would continue to rapidly decline relative to the
baseline scenario. However, with current prospects for oil production and oil prices, this scenario is unlikely.

Safeguards Assessment
Under the Fund's safeguards assessment policy, the Central Bank of Azerbaijan (CBA) was subject to
an assessment with respect to the PRGF arrangement that was approved on July 06, 2001, and
expired on July 5, 2004. The assessment was completed on March 11, 2002, and it was concluded
that the external audit and financial reporting were adequate. The assessment proposed a set of
measures to strengthen internal control, data reporting to the Fund, and the legal framework. The
majority of the recommendations were implemented, except for the recommendation to establish
an Audit Committee. The external audit of 2011 CBA financial statements was completed by
April 2012, and the audited financial statements along with the audit opinion has been published on
the bank’s website as an integral part of 2011 annual report.

Exchange Rate Arrangements
The currency of Azerbaijan is the manat, which became sole legal tender on January 1, 1994. The de
jure exchange rate regime is “other managed arrangement” since March 2011, but the de facto
regime remains as “stabilized arrangement”, based on the authorities’ policy to allow greater
exchange rate flexibility since late 2010.
Azerbaijan accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 effective November 30, 2004,
and maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on the making of payments and
transfers for current international transactions, except for restrictions maintained for security reasons
that have been notified to the Fund.
Article IV Consultation
The 2011 Article IV consultation with Azerbaijan was concluded on January 9, 2012.
ROSCs
A fiscal transparency ROSC module was prepared by FAD (SM/00/278, 12/12/01) and updated in
April 2003 (SM/03/159, 04/30/03). A fiscal ROSC update mission took place in April 2005. A data
dissemination ROSC module was completed by STA in March 2003 (IMF Country Report No. 03/86).
The authorities published the fiscal ROSC, and it is available on the IMF web site. Several financial
systems ROSC were conducted in the context of the FSAP (2003–04) but were not published. A CPI
data ROSC completed in July 2008 (IMF Country Report No. 08/273).

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK
(As of March 2013)

1.

The World Bank is currently implementing a two-pillar Country Partnership Strategy (CPS)

that focuses on: (i) building a competitive non-oil economy; and (ii) strengthening social and
municipal services; with a strong cross-cutting theme of governance and anticorruption.
2.

This strategy builds on the Governments own development strategies and includes: (a)

Under Pillar I, strengthening the non-oil economy, primarily through an improved business
environment, better infrastructure and agriculture improvements, and (b) Under Pillar 2, improving
the effectiveness of social and community services, including health, education, social protection
and water supply.
3.

During the current CPS period, the Bank has increased its focus on implementation of

existing operations and only considered new operations in selected areas with a strong record of
sufficient institutional capacity and ownership.
4.

The ongoing FY11–14 CPS Progress Report (CPS PR) assesses the objectives of the CPS as

relevant in the long run and refines the WBG program for FY13–14 to adjust to the changing
environment
5.

The Progress Report confirms the Bank’s stance on modest and selective lending. The

program for FY13–14 is expected to be in line with the Government’s own borrowing plans of
US$120–150 million per year from IBRD. This program will focus on sectors in which external
borrowing from international financial institutions is economically and socially justified based on
expected returns, knowledge and technology transfer, and proven implementation capacity.
Specifically, projects to be proposed by the Bank will support improved competitiveness in
agriculture, solid waste management, water supply and sanitation, judicial modernization, roads and
health sectors.
6.

IFC’s active portfolio as of June 30, 2012 consisted of five projects focused on improving the

business enabling environment, strengthening bank financial markets infrastructure, and helping
microfinance institutions to reduce their reliance on grants and operate on a commercial basis. IFC
remains engaged in the areas of capital market modernization, crisis management and corporate
governance through the regional programs, such as ECA Corporate Governance Project and ECA
Banking Advisory.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF AZERBAIJAN

7.

Bank lending will be complemented by a strong program of knowledge services to inform

the country growth strategy and policy choices as well as the design of investment operations. The
Bank will increase analytic work in the areas of job creation and growth, poverty and inequality, the
financial sector, agriculture and irrigation, wastewater, and public expenditures. The set of Policy
Notes prepared for the High Level Economic Policy Forum (HELP) focused on economic
diversification, agriculture, education, and institutional development. Two important analytical
pieces have been delivered within the Programmatic Poverty Assessment. The first Programmatic
Public Expenditure Review (PPER) is planned for FY13. Two more analytical pieces have been
delivered in FY13, namely on National Solid Waste Strategy and Private Sector Participation in Solid
Waste Management, and two more will be delivered, namely, Economic Diversification for Growth,
and Fostering Entrepreneurship in South Caucasus.
8.

The Government has agreed in principle to partner with the Bank through a reimbursable

Joint Economic Research Program (JERP). The Bank and the Government have also established a
strong vehicle for policy dialogue in two high level policy fora held for the first time in 2009 and
then in March 2012.
9.

Relations between the Bank and the Fundconcerning Azerbaijan are very good in terms of

coordinated policy advice and collaboration on macroeconomic monitoring. There is also broad
agreement between the Bank and the Fund on the division of labor between the two institutions.
10.

The Fund will continue to focus on macro-critical areas, and will share responsibilities with

the Bank on banking and financial sector soundness, taking care to coordinate closely so as to
minimize overlap and ensure harmonization of policy advice.

RELATIONS WITH THE EUROPEAN BANK FOR
RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT (EBRD)
(As of December 31, 2012, Update as of March 2013 in paragraph 5)
1.

As of 31 December 2012, the EBRD has invested approximately US$2.1 billion in 130

projects. The current active portfolio amounts to US$861 million of which 85 percent has been
disbursed, and operating assets amount to US$559 million. The ratio of private sector projects in the
portfolio now stands at around 70 percent.
2.

Strategic priorities for the EBRD’s activites in Azerbaijan, set out in the country strategy

approved by the Board in 2010, include (i) development of the non-oil sector through investments
in the enterprise sector, with an emphasis on agribusiness, and acting as a catalyst to attract much
needed foreign investment and know-how; (ii) promoting competition, consolidation as well as
foreign investment in the financial sector and assisting in the development of new financial
instruments; (iii) supporting the development of microfinance, particularly in the regions, and
promoting the expansion of the non-bank financial sector; (iv) supporting infrastructure
development with a particular focus on power and energy savings, promoting transparent
procurement practices, instilling commercial discipline and improving financial transparency and
corporate governance; and (iv) providing advisory services to companies through its Small Business
Support (SBS) programmes. The Bank is working on a new three-year strategy for Azerbaijan,
expected to be discussed by the Board by end-2013

In the energy and natural resources sectors, the EBRD financed several landmark

transactions such as the BTC pipeline, AZDRES Power Rehabilitation and the Shah Deniz gas field.
The EBRD also financed three power sector projects for a total of US$281 million, making Azerenerji,
Azerbaijan's state-owned power utility, EBRD's second largest client in the country. Energy and
natural resources represents 30 percent of the overall portfolio. The industry, commerce and
agribusiness (ICA) sector represents about 10 percent by volume, but 30 percent by number of
tranactons and includes major investments across a broad range of segments from building
materials to mineral water bottling. In the financial sector (one fifth of the portfolio), EBRD has
equity stakes in three Azerbaijani banks and provides funding for on-lending to the MSME sector to
a further six banks and four micro-finance institutions. The infrastructure sector, which constitutes

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF AZERBAIJAN

40 percent of EBRD's portfolio, includes US$250 mln for Regional Roads Reconstruction and
Upgrading Project, EBRD’s largest investment in Azerbaijan to date.
4.

In 2012, EBRD invested a total of US$109 million in 16 projects. EBRD financed seven

projects in the ICA sector including food processing and the development of a retail chain, with the
average investment size of less than US$5 million. Four projects were in the agribusiness sector and
three in the manufacturing and services sector. In the financial sector, EBRD signed eight projects,
including credit lines with two micro-finance organizations and four existing partner banks to be
onlent to micro companies and SMEs. There was a marked increase in the amount of EBRD lending
in local currency. Subordinated debt was provided to one EBRD investee banks to support tier II
capital. EBRD also continued to provide technical assistance in the areas of institution building,
credit appraisal and risk management to financial institutions, and accountancy standards, corporate
governance to ICA clients.
5.

During the first two months of 2013, the EBRD has signed three projects with financial

institutions for approximately US$12 million, including first energy efficiency loan in the sector. The
Bank expects to sign a further 13 transactions by end-2013, including projects with natural
resources, financial institutions, infrastructure and ICA clients.
6.

Azerbaijan is a part of the EBRD’s Early Transition Countries (ETC) initiative. Launched in

April 2004, this initiative aims to increase investments in EBRD’s eight countries of operation in the
early transition stage, while building on international efforts to address poverty in these countries.
Through this initiative, the EBRD focuses its efforts on private sector business development and
selected public sector interventions. It aims to stimulate market activity by using a streamlined
approach to financing, focusing on smaller projects, mobilizing more investment, and encouraging
ongoing economic reform. EBRD will accept higher risk in the projects it finances in the ETCs, while
still respecting the principles of sound banking

STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.

Economic and financial statistics provided to the Fund are broadly adequate for surveillance

purposes. Although the authorities have made significant progress in improving the quality and
timeliness of their macroeconomic statistics, a number of weaknesses should be addressed,
particularly in the areas of national accounts, price statistics, and external sector statistics. STA has
provided extensive technical assistance and recommendations in these areas.
2.

Azerbaijan has participated in the GDDS since mid-2001. In April 2002, a data ROSC mission

reviewed Azerbaijan’s data dissemination practices against GDDS guidelines and conducted an
assessment of the quality of national accounts, consumer price index (CPI), producer price index
(PPI), government finance, monetary, and balance of payments statistics. The data module of the
ROSC is available on the IMF’s external website. Azerbaijan nominated a national SDDS Coordinator
in August 2005. An SDDS assessment mission in April 2007 provided technical assistance on the
outstanding issues required for SDDS subscription. A data ROSC module to reassess the Consumer
Price Index (CPI) completed in July 2008.

A. Real Sector
National accounts and price statistics
3.

Under STA’s national accounts project, significant technical assistance has been provided to

the State Statistics Committee (SSC) and progress has been made in a number of areas. Methods for
compiling gross national income have been improved and revised estimates disseminated; quarterly
national account estimates at constant prices for 1998–2004 have been compiled; capital investment
data have been revised; estimates of undeclared wages have been made; and a new methodology
for calculating price indices for the construction and transportation sectors is well underway. The
March-April 2005 mission identified the following problems: (i) the Oil Fund’s transactions are not
adequately reflected in the national accounts due to lack of information from the Oil Fund; (ii) the
SSC does not have sufficient information to make reliable estimates of remittances from domestic
residents working abroad; and (iii) there are no estimates of informal sector activity. The February
2013 mission that visited Baku at the request of the authorities prepared an action plan for the
development and publication of discrete quarterly national account statistics.
4.

In January 2005, the CPI was revamped—the consumption basket was expanded to cover

585 items and expenditure weights updated to reflect recent consumption patterns. With respect to
regional coverage, which is now expanded to 54 regions, the SSC used population-based weights in

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF AZERBAIJAN

the aggregation of elementary price indices. However, this treatment raised methodological
questions, because (i) international best practices suggest the use of expenditure-based weights in
every stage of aggregation in CPI compilation, and (ii) population shares are not reliable proxies for
regional expenditure shares. The recent reassessment of the CPI found that, although the SSC did
use population weights for regional aggregation through 2006, it has weighted regional indexes by
expenditure since 2007, using 2006 Household Budget Survey results on household expenditure,
while 2009 data are based on 2008 expenditure weights.
5.

It is important for the SSC to measure both the asset and rental prices of housing.

Accordingly, the 2008 CPI reassessment mission suggested compiling a house price index, which
would provide an estimate of inflation for the capital formation component of household final
expenditure. The SSC has been considering proposing such an index for its statistical development
program, as a new price indicator distinct from its consumption-based CPI.

B. Fiscal Sector
6.

Recent treasury modernization efforts are expected to improve the compilation of fiscal

data. With the assistance of a Fund peripatetic advisor, the Ministry of Finance developed the
treasury chart of accounts (COA), an essential input to the new treasury system. The October 2006
STA government finance statistics mission found the latest draft COA broadly consistent with the
Government Finance Statistics Manual, 2001. The work on the COA is proceeding in parallel with the
computerization of Treasury operations.
7.

The 2002 data ROSC mission recommended expanding the coverage of government finance

statistics by including all operations recorded by the treasury and publishing details on financing
and debt outstanding. Starting in 2006, the state budget incorporates transfers to Nakhichevan as a
separate expenditure item, but no further details are provided.
8.

The 2012 STA mission that visited Baku at the request of the authorities, provided assistance

with the preparation of financial reports based on the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001
(GFSM 2001). The mission concluded that while further work is needed on improving the source
data for the compilation of these statistics, the present level of development of budgetary
accounting and reporting system makes it possible a preliminary compilation and dissemination of
the GFS in accordance with the GFSM 2001 on an annual and quarterly basis.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

REPUBLIC OF AZERBAIJAN

C. Monetary Sector
9.

The Central Bank of Azerbaijan (CBA) compiles monetary statistics according to the

methodology of the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual. The CBA reports monetary data to
STA within three weeks after the end of the reference month, via Standardized Report Forms (SRFs).
Monetary and financial data have also been published in the International Financial Statistics (IFS)
Supplement since December 2006.

D. External Sector
10.

Azerbaijan’s balance of payments (BOP) statistics are compiled and disseminated by the CBA

and are broadly in accordance with the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual (BPM5). The
CBA has also initiated compilation of International Investment Position (IIP) statistics. The IIP data
for 2002–2008 have been published in IFS; however, the authorities have indicated that they have
discontinued the compilation of IIP data effective 2009.
11.

During November 2006–November 2008, a Regional Advisor in External Sector Statistics to

Azerbaijan and Georgia was stationed in Baku to (i) facilitate activities carried out by different
government agencies in the development of external sector statistics; (ii) assist with statistical
capacity building; (iii) coordinate the technical assistance activities of STA with the MCD’s work
program; and (iv) assist the authorities in coordinating with other international institutions and
bilateral agencies involved in technical assistance in statistics in Azerbaijan and Georgia. Moreover,
Azerbaijan has benefited from a STA technical assistance mission in external sector statistics, which
visited Baku in October 2009 to further assist the authorities with addressing a number of
outstanding issues related to the compilation and dissemination of external sector statistics.
12.

The 2009 mission found that appropriate statistical legislation to assign responsibilities for

compilation and dissemination of external sector stocks statistics (IIP and gross external debt) has
yet to be developed. A draft Presidential Decree On Improvement of the Gross External Debt and
International Investment Position Statistics of Azerbaijan was developed in order to authorize the
CBA to compile private and public debt data from relevant agencies, but still has not been
approved. As a result, the CBA temporarily discontinued dissemination of IIP statistics and the
development of the compilation system for the IIP and gross external debt statistics. The mission
recommended the authorities to address these issues, as they would affect the timing of
Azerbaijan’s subscription to the SDDS. The mission also expressed concerns with regard to the pace
of implementation of the strategic framework for the development of external sector statistics,

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF AZERBAIJAN

which may be affected by recent staff turnover and a change in the status of the BOP Department
(now a division).
13.

The 2009 mission also found that, in spite of the CBA’s efforts, data sharing and data

provision remain a challenge for the compilation of external sector statistics. Consequently, the
mission recommended to set up a formal, high-level structure for data sharing and data provision.
14.

The 2012 STA mission found low prospects for restarting work on the IIP (annual data were

last published for 2008) as the legal position has not changed since STA’s previous mission in 2009
and the data sharing and data provision across government agencies remain a challenge. The
mission also discussed the BOP compilation methodology and assumptions, and made several
recommendations in the areas of data validation, and in fine tuning the data to the BPM6
specifications. Work on the transition to BPM6 is well underway, with technical assistance provided
by the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO, based in Switzerland).
15.

Statistics for public and publicly guaranteed external debt are reported quarterly on a due-

for-payment basis with a lag of one to two months. A debt service schedule for public and publicly
guaranteed external debt, separately identifying the principal and interest components, is also
provided with a one quarter lag. However, systematic information on nonguaranteed external debt,
including a sectoral breakdown, is lacking. On external debt, the 2005 BOP mission noted that it
would be desirable to use balance sheet data from commercial banks pertaining to banking sector
liabilities, which would permit presentation of information with a breakdown by maturities and
instruments.
16.

Monthly data on total official reserve assets and daily CBA net interventions in the foreign

exchange market are provided within 15 days of the end of each month. Data on official reserves
during the month are provided on request from Fund staff. Azerbaijan does not disseminate
International Reserves and Foreign Currency Liquidity Template data, but the CBA and the
government have stated that there have not been any forward or futures transactions that could
give rise to contingent short-term net drains on foreign currency assets. STA has recently advised
the authorities on the definition and coverage of gross official reserve assets. As the authorities
indicated that several definitions of gross official reserve assets are used, STA stressed the
importance of using only one definition, more specifically the definition that follows the sixth edition
of the Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual (BPM6). STA will continue
to provide advice to the authorities for the correct compilation of Azerbaijan’s gross official reserve
assets.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
May 21, 2013

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation with the
Republic of Azerbaijan
On May 3, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Azerbaijan.1
Background
Economic growth recovered in 2012, reaching 2.2 percent on the back of a more moderate
decline in oil output than in 2011 and continued strong non-oil growth of 9.6 percent, supported
by public spending. Shortfalls from new wells and maintenance issues continue to reduce oil
output for a second year in a row. Inflation dropped sharply to an average of 1.1 percent
in 2012, mainly reflecting the impact of global and domestic food price trends. The manat
exchange rate has appreciated by less than 2 percent against the U.S. dollar since
November 2010. The external position remains strong, supported by high oil prices and sizeable
public assets accumulation which could reach about 66 percent of GDP by the end of 2012.
Expansionary fiscal policy continued in 2012 with the non-oil fiscal primary deficit increasing to
45 percent of non-oil GDP from 41 percent in 2011. The non-oil deficit will increase further
in 2013 if the government implements the large public investment program approved in the
budget.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
Monetary policy turned accommodative in late 2012 and early 2013 as the Central Bank of
Azerbaijan (CBA) lowered its benchmark refinancing rate by 250 basis points in December and
then again in February, partly in response to low inflation. Direct lending to the real economy by
the CBA surged in 2012, though macro prudential measures are being developed to slow the
rapid growth in private sector credit, particularly consumer loans. With a view to foster
consolidation and competition in the banking system, the CBA increased the minimum capital
requirements for banks by fivefold. There remains little progress in the restructuring of the
International Bank of Azerbaijan, the systemic public bank
Near-term economic prospects are generally positive, though with an increasing risk of
overheating and the deepening of fiscal vulnerabilities. Overall GDP growth is expected at
around 4 percent in 2013 and similar levels over the medium term, driven by government
spending. With the non-oil economy hitting capacity constraints and expansionary fiscal policy,
headline inflation is projected to reach 7 percent by end-year, above the CBA’s 5–6 percent
target range, for an annual average of 3½ percent. Inflation could rise to above 6 percent over
the medium term. Projections for the external position remain favorable, sustained by continued
high oil prices. Risks emanate mainly from a fall in oil prices given Azerbaijan’s low reliance on
non-oil exports. But large foreign assets could provide sufficient buffer to mitigate the impact of
future shocks, including a sharp and sustained decline in oil prices.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcome Azerbaijan’s rapid growth in recent years and its strong buffers
against external instability, but noted that critical challenges lie ahead. Continued expansionary
policies may be fueling short-term risks to macroeconomic stability, while the depletion of oil
reserves undermines the medium-term viability of the development strategy. Directors
considered that high oil prices at present offer a good opportunity to adjust the course of
economic policies from a position of relative strength.
Directors cautioned that continued growth in public spending is exacerbating the budgetary
dependence on oil revenues and increasing the risks from a fall in global oil prices. Accordingly,
most Directors encouraged the authorities to undertake a moderate front-loaded fiscal
consolidation, which would create room for private sector activity. Fiscal adjustment could be
achieved by improving the efficiency of public spending, including through a better selection of
capital projects, and by strengthening public financial management and revenue collection.
More broadly, Directors encouraged the authorities to revamp the fiscal policy framework in line
with recent IMF guidance for resource-rich developing countries. A fiscal rule and strong
institutional arrangements consistent with international best practice could strengthen fiscal
discipline, particularly at times of high oil prices, boost fiscal sustainability, and promote a sound
management of oil revenue.

3
Directors supported the readiness of the Central Bank of Azerbaijan (CBA) to tighten monetary
policy if price pressures intensify. They also suggested that the CBA discontinue its direct
lending to the real economy, which was meant to be a temporary response to the global
economic crisis. Looking ahead, they agreed that a gradual move toward greater exchange rate
flexibility would improve the economy’s ability to absorb shocks as the share of non-oil exports
grows.
Directors noted the assessment that the financial sector remains sound. They welcomed
ongoing efforts to preserve financial sector stability, including by recapitalizing some banks and
adopting prudential measures to contain the growth of consumer credit. Directors encouraged
the authorities to continue strengthening the supervisory framework and to restructure the
largest bank.
Directors supported the government’s 2020 vision of making Azerbaijan a competitive and
diversified economy. They observed that the development of non-oil exports will require
ambitious structural reforms to reduce formal and informal barriers to trade and competition,
improve the business climate, facilitate access of private companies to capital, and combat
corruption and money laundering.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by René Weber, Executive Director for the Republic of Azerbaijan
And Sebastien Waelti, Advisor to Executive Director
May 3, 2013
On behalf of our Azerbaijani authorities, we thank staff for the constructive policy discussions
and their report. The authorities welcome the continued productive dialogue with the Fund and
consider the staff’s recommendations pertinent. They would like to express their appreciation to
staff for choosing Azerbaijan as a pilot country to apply the Resource-Rich Developing
Countries toolkit.
Since the last Executive Board meeting on Azerbaijan three years ago, the authorities have made
further progress in reforms, while sustaining macroeconomic stability. Azerbaijan’s external
position has improved further, the process of economic diversification has accelerated, its foreign
currency reserves have increased, and the country’s standing has been upgraded by the major
credit rating agencies. The authorities would like to stress that the strong and sustained growth in
non-oil output, recovering oil production, and substantial current account surplus allow the
country to maintain macroeconomic stability. Substantial financial buffers in excess of USD 46
billion (70 percent of GDP), very low external public debt levels (below 9 percent of GDP), and
market access provide ample policy space in case downside risks should materialize.
Fiscal Policy
The authorities remain committed to transforming oil revenue into productive assets, including
human capital, to promote sustained and inclusive growth. The medium term fiscal strategy
focuses on reducing the non-oil budget deficit through enlarging the revenue base and
prioritizing expenditures. The recent updates to the tax code aim at broadening the tax base and
improving the effectiveness of tax administration. The government targets to cover recurrent
expenditures with non-oil sector revenue. On the expenditure side, the authorities believe that
rationalizing public investment through prioritization and the effective evaluation of projects will
significantly contribute to the fiscal consolidation objective. The fiscal framework thus supports
a stable environment for economic activity, encourages private sector development, and is
conducive to foreign investment.
The authorities reiterate their commitment to ensure medium-term fiscal sustainability and
highlight the need for flexibility to adjust their fiscal stance, should domestic or international
developments call for it. They anticipate reduced transfers from the State Oil Fund to the budget
in the medium term, but emphasize that the current buffer in the State Oil Fund allows to deal
adequately with adverse external shocks, while supporting macroeconomic objectives.
The authorities express their concern that the data used in Box 1 in the staff report do not present
an accurate description of the current level and efficiency of public investment. The IMF
working paper, on which the analysis in Box 1 is based upon, relies on PEFA data for 2007 in

2

the case of Azerbaijan. Since then, Azerbaijan has embarked on a large-scale infrastructure
investment program. The authorities caution against the extrapolation of a single data point
several years ago to draw conclusions about the current level and efficiency of public
investment. It should also be noted that the bulk of these infrastructure investments was
conducted in cooperation with international development institutions, such as the World Bank
and the Asian Development Bank.
Monetary and Foreign Exchange Rate Policies
The main goal of monetary policy in 2013 is to maintain the inflation rate within the 5-6 percent
target range. The rapid fall in inflation during 2012 provided room for loosening monetary
policy. This being said, the Central Bank is ready to act swiftly, if inflation threatens to exceed
its target range. The authorities are eager to maintain inflation in low single-digits and to
strengthen the transmission channels of monetary policy.
The authorities agree with staff that a more flexible exchange rate regime would enable a more
effective monetary policy and provide additional tools to weather potential shocks as the
economy diversifies. They stress, however, that the switch to greater exchange rate flexibility is
a longer term goal and must be gradual, sequenced correctly, and coordinated with all relevant
agencies. Fund technical assistance in this area is very much appreciated by the authorities.
The authorities consider that the expected current account surplus will be the main factor in
affecting the manat/US dollar exchange rate in 2013. They reiterate their commitment to a stable
external value of the manat and stand ready to intervene in response to potential sharp
fluctuations. This commitment is credibly underpinned by the significant international foreign
exchange reserves at the disposal of Azerbaijan.
Financial Sector Reforms
The banking sector remains fundamentally sound. The ratio of non-performing loans is low,
capital adequacy ratios are high, and banks’ liquidity positions are strong. During 2012, the
authorities took measures to further tighten corporate governance regulations, risk management
practices, and prudential regulations to strengthen financial sector stability. They believe that the
ongoing capitalization and consolidation process will create a more competitive banking sector.
Even after a five-fold increase in minimum capital requirements, banks that combine for 89
percent of total banking sector assets already meet the new requirements.
The authorities are determined to continue closely monitoring the banking system, strengthen
banking supervision, and improve corporate governance in this sector. They also look forward to
to the forthcoming FSAP and thank staff for their readiness to assist. Increasing non-cash
transaction volumes in the economy significantly will be one of the reform priorities of the
authorities. The authorities acknowledge the importance of restructuring IBA, but they stress that

3

the process should be carefully planned and proceed at a pace consistent with maintaining
banking sector stability. The authorities highlight that they will continue taking steps in 2013 to
accelerate the integration into global financial markets and to create a risk-based prudential
framework harmonized with Basel III standards.
