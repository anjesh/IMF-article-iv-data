IMF Executive Board Concludes 2016 Article IV Consultation with the Republic of the
Marshall Islands

On July 25, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the 2016
Article IV consultation1 with the Republic of the Marshall Islands.
The Republic of the Marshall Islands is an isolated and thinly-populated island state that is
vulnerable to climate change owing to its low elevation. Its economy is highly dependent on
external aid, as the base for private sector growth is limited by its small size, remoteness, and
dispersion over a vast ocean area.
Overcoming the contraction of the previous year, the Marshallese economy is estimated to have
expanded by about 0.5 percent in FY2015 (ending September 30), as the fishery sector
recovered. Following a moderate inflation of 1.1 percent in FY2014, headline inflation dropped
to -2.2 percent in FY2015 amid falling oil and utility prices. The fiscal balance is estimated to
have recorded a surplus of about 3 percent of GDP in FY2014–15, due to record-high fishing
license fees.
Growth is expected to rise to about 1.5 percent and inflation to about 0.5 percent in FY2016, as
the effects of the drought earlier this year are offset by the resumption of infrastructure projects.
The fiscal balance is projected to decline to a smaller surplus in FY2016 but, without reforms,
would deteriorate to a sizable deficit over the medium term owing to the steady decline in
Compact grants until FY2023. After an expected growth rebound fueled by the implementation
of delayed infrastructure projects, GDP is projected to grow at the potential rate of 1–1.5 percent
over the medium term, absent structural reforms.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors welcomed the improvement in economic activity, but noted that the
Republic of the Marshall Islands continues to face significant challenges arising from the
scheduled decline in Compact grants, extreme weather-related events due to climate change, and
limited private sector activity. Directors underscored the importance of sound macroeconomic
policies to ensure long-term fiscal sustainability, safeguard financial stability, reduce
vulnerabilities to external shocks, and promote sustainable growth.
Directors emphasized that fiscal consolidation over the medium-term is key to building adequate
buffers against existing fiscal vulnerabilities. They agreed that implementation of adjustment
efforts envisioned in the Decrement Management Plan will be important. Accordingly, Directors
recommended steps to contain expenditure, especially current spending while avoiding delays in
infrastructure spending, further reducing subsidies to state-owned enterprises (SOEs), enhancing
tax administration, and strengthening tax and social security systems. Accelerating the pace of
public financial management reforms will be critical in implementing the needed fiscal
adjustment and in addressing the existing weaknesses in budget execution, reporting and
planning.
Directors emphasized the need for continued efforts to mitigate climate change risks, including
explicit budget provisions for adaptation costs. They also encouraged the authorities to sustain
the reform of SOEs to facilitate private sector development. In this regard, Directors highlighted
that clarifying community service obligations of SOEs and establishing a centralized monitoring
unit, building on the legislation of the SOE Act, will be important.
Directors emphasized the need to strengthen the capacity and oversight authority of the Banking
Commission to safeguard financial stability, including the challenges posed by withdrawal of
correspondent banking relationships. Efforts should also be made to address the regulatory gaps,
including in the AML/CFT framework. Directors encouraged the Banking Commission to
consider a ceiling on the allowed household debt service ratio, and introduce stricter criteria on
non-performing loan classification. Directors supported the authorities’ plans to refocus the
Marshall Island Development Bank to its core mandate of providing commercial lending.
Directors emphasized that structural reforms are needed to facilitate private sector growth.
Reform effort should be aimed at increasing competiveness and reducing impediments to doing
business, notably by improving access to credit and strengthening the property registration and
bankruptcy framework. Enhancing statistics will help strengthen policy planning and analysis.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
Context. The Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) is an isolated and thinly-populated
fragile state vulnerable to climate change. Its economy is highly dependent on external
aid, as private sector growth is constrained by its small size and remoteness, dispersion
over a vast ocean area, and regulatory weakness. The country needs to adapt to climate
change, prepare for a sharp reduction in the U.S. grants in FY2023, and enhance the
platform for sustainable private-sector growth. Although the economy is expected to
expand modestly in FY2016, the fiscal balance will likely fall into deficit in the medium
term without a sustained adjustment, undermining long-term self-sufficiency.
Key Policy Recommendations.


A medium-term fiscal surplus of 3 percent of GDP is needed to build adequate
buffers ahead of the FY2023 reduction of Compact grants, entailing a gradual fiscal
adjustment of about 5 percentage points of GDP over seven years to be achieved
by consolidating expenditures and reforming the tax and social security systems.



Continued efforts to adapt to climate change are recommended, including the
explicit budgeting of fiscal provisions. Funding should be sought from diverse
sources, including grants and disaster risk insurances.



To facilitate private sector development, state-owned enterprise (SOE) reform
should continue. Building on the SOE Act of October 2015, the authorities should
clarify community service obligations and establish a centralized monitoring unit.



The capacity and oversight authority of the Banking Commission should be
strengthened to safeguard financial stability, including the challenges posed by
withdrawal of correspondent banking relationships (CBRs).

BACKGROUND
1.
The Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) is a small and sparsely-populated country,
comprising low-lying atolls vulnerable to climate change (Box 1). Its economy is highly
dependent on external aid, as the base for private sector growth is limited by its small size,
remoteness from major traffic routes, dispersion over a vast ocean area, and weaknesses in the
regulatory framework. Over the medium term, the country needs to adapt to rising fallouts from
climate change, to prepare for a sharp reduction in the U.S. grants in FY2023, and to enhance the
platform for sustainable private-sector growth. A new government was formed in January 2016,
headed by the first female head of state elected in the Pacific.

3.
Relative to the past Fund recommendations, progress has been made including in SOE
reforms (Appendix II). Some reforms now await follow-up implementation, while several delayed
reforms—tax and social security—need to be resuscitated. Over a longer term, the RMI needs to
make progress toward Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), building on the progress with core
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) (Appendix III). The RMI’s progress in most MDGs was
broadly in line with other Pacific islands, while the two MDGs in health areas were achieved fully. This
reflected above-average health (and education) expenditures, partly due to a wide geographical
dispersion of the population.

The government’s fiscal year ends on September 30 of each calendar year. The amended Compact Agreement took
effect in FY2004.

This grant amount has already been appropriated by the U.S. Congress and is thus allocated and secured, while
annual disbursement follows steps required under the Compact agreement.

REPUBLIC OF THE MARSHALL ISLANDS

DEVELOPMENTS, OUTLOOK AND RISKS
A. Recent Developments and Outlook
4.
Real GDP growth is estimated to have returned to a positive territory in FY2015, while
CPI inflation has been falling. Overcoming the contraction of the previous year, the economy is
estimated to have expanded by 0.4 percent in FY2015, as the fishery sector recovered. Following
a moderate inflation of 1.1 percent in FY2014, headline inflation dropped to -2.2 percent in FY2015
amid falling oil and utility prices. Going forward, growth is expected to rise to 1.4 percent and
inflation to 0.7 percent in FY2016, as the effects of the drought earlier this year are offset by the
resumption of Compact-funded infrastructure spending.3 After several years of growth rebound
fueled by the delayed implementation of infrastructure projects, GDP is projected to grow at the
potential rate of 1–1.5 percent over the medium term, absent structural reforms.
5.
The overall fiscal balance, in surplus over FY2014–15, will likely deteriorate to a deficit
over the medium term. The fiscal balance is estimated to have recorded a surplus of about
3 percent of GDP in FY2014–15, due to record-high fishing license fees. It is projected to decline to a
smaller surplus in FY2016 and, without reforms, to a deficit of 2 percent of GDP over the medium
term owing to the steady decline in Compact grants until FY2023, and sizable transfers to SOEs and
the social security system.
6.
The current account deficit (including official grants) would likely worsen in FY2016
from an estimated 1.6 percent-of-GDP deficit in FY2015. Weak copra and oil prices4, and higher
imports due to the resumption of infrastructure projects are projected to worsen the deficit in
FY2016–17. Current account deficits are financed by a stable source of funding largely from the
United States and grants from other donors.
7.
Banks provide only limited corporate credit despite ample deposits. Private sector credit
reached nearly 50 percent of GDP in FY2015, mainly on account of consumer loans (corporate loans
represent only 30 percent of total loans). A legislative framework for bankruptcy is missing, and
posting property as collateral is hindered by complex land ownership issues. The loan-to-deposit
ratio of the banking system remained low, at around 60 percent as of end-FY2015. Interest rate
spreads (between lending and deposit rates) were around 5 percent for corporate loans and
13 percent for consumer loans, reflecting high credit risk.

B. External Stability
8.
The RMI’s external position is assessed to be broadly consistent with underlying
fundamentals, with limited risk of external instability due to stable external funding (Box 2).
The current account deficit, once adjusted for a temporary factor, is close to the current account

norm as estimated by the standard Fund methodology. The real exchange rate so far in FY2016 is
7 percent above the historical average (FY2004–15), narrowing the scope of possible undervaluation
of the past, and is now assessed to be broadly in equilibrium albeit subject to a sizable statistical
uncertainty. The U.S. dollar is used as the legal tender adequately reflecting the small economic size
and close economic ties with the United States. The risks from a heavy reliance on external financing
are limited by stable funding, including the Compact grants until FY2023. Nevertheless, it is desirable
to strengthen buffers, in preparation for the post-FY2023 period, including by building up the CTF
balance to a level sufficient for preserving its real value and by shoring up government deposits
which are the first recourse for absorbing short-term liquidity shocks.
Box 1. Marshall Islands: Implications of Climate Change
Marshall Islands is one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change and rising sea levels. The related fiscal costs
can be large and are explicitly recognized in the macro-framework and the DSA.
Many small island states—especially the atoll nations of the Pacific—are among the most vulnerable to climate
change and sea-level rise. Because of their low elevation and
small size, low-lying atolls (e.g., Kiribati, the RMI, and Tuvalu) are
threatened by future rises in sea level. Depending on carbon
emissions, the global mean sea level could rise by up to a meter
by 2100 according to the 2014 report of the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). This would pose serious risks to
the RMI, as a rise of 1 meter could lead to a loss of 80 percent of
the land in the capital city of Majuro (IPCC 2001; Calderon and
others, 2015).
RMI is already becoming more vulnerable to extreme weather
events. With average elevation of just 2 meters above sea level,
inundations and large storms are already becoming an increasing
threat to the Marshall Islands. In 2008, extreme waves and high tides caused widespread flooding in Majuro, resulting
in the government declaring a state of emergency. In 2013, the northern atolls experienced serious drought, resulting
in the U.S. President declaring an emergency that activated US$5.5 million (3 percent of GDP) of drought relief from
the United States under the Compact Agreement. In February 2016, the government declared a state of emergency,
citing severe drought conditions, consequence of a protracted El Niño system that started building up in early 2015,
which was followed by a declaration of emergency by the U.S. President, activating support from the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).
In this context, climate change can lead to both structural and cyclical fiscal costs.



The structural component (2.5 percent of GDP per year) is related to the cost of preparing for climate change,
including by building coastal protection. The relative costs of coastal adaptation vary strongly among regions, but
small island states are expected to face costs of several percentage points of GDP a year, since most of their
population and infrastructure are in the coastal zone (IPCC, 2014). The ADB has estimated these costs in the order
of 1½–2½ percent of GDP annually for the Pacific region (ADB, 2013). We take the higher end of this range for
the RMI, given its higher vulnerability.1



The cyclical component (10 percent of GDP over 20 years) is related to the fact that climate change is a
contributing factor to extreme weather events. The Pacific Catastrophe Risk Assessment and Financing Initiative
(PCRAFI) reports that disaster-related losses and damages of 10 percent of GDP could occur once every 20 years
in the RMI (PCRAFI, 2011).

1

The IPCC (2014) models suggest that the costs of sea level rise impacts as a percentage of GDP would be highest for the Federated
States of Micronesia, Palau, Marshall Islands, and Nauru in the Pacific and Bahamas in the Caribbean.

Box 2. Marshall Islands: External Sector Assessment
On balance, the external position appears to be broadly consistent with underlying fundamentals and risks to
external stability are limited owing to stable source of funding from the United States and other donors.
Exchange rate Assessment. The current account balance, once adjusted for the effect of a temporary hold of
capital grants (in FY2014–15), is close to the current account norm estimated by the standard Fund methodology
(the EBA-lite). While the ELRER approach suggests a moderately weak external position, a larger-than-usual
margin of statistical variation may be warranted, given data limitations of the RMI. On balance, the level of the
exchange rate is assessed to be broadly consistent with the macroeconomic situation, with little evidence of
substantial exchange rate misalignment.

Reserves. With no central bank or local currency, government’s deposit serves as the means to absorb short-term
liquidity shocks. The government’s deposit was around 0.5 months of imports in 2015, slightly lower than the
historical average (0.7 months over 21 years), although the steady flow of external grants has shielded the RMI
from liquidity squeezes.
External Financing. Current account deficits are financed by a stable source of funding largely from the United
States. External debt is expected to decline as concessionary loans are paid down in the coming years.

C. Risks and Spillover
9.
Risks to the outlook are tilted to the downside, albeit limited by several mitigating
factors (Appendix IV). External risks stem from extreme weather-related events, faster-thananticipated rise in fuel prices, persistently low rates of return on financial assets in the CTF, and
potential loss of a correspondent banking relationship. Domestic risks include delays in the
implementation of infrastructure projects and inadequate fiscal consolidation. Finally, DSA analysis
indicates that the RMI continues to remain at a high risk of external debt distress, but these risks are
mitigated by a number of factors, including concessionality of most obligations, stable flow of funds
from Compact grants until FY2023, and future investment income from the CTF (after FY2023). On
the upside, a decisive push for structural reforms could stimulate growth (see below). Moreover, if
downside risks were to materialize, the authorities could accelerate infrastructure spending, financed
by allocated but unused funds for capital spending (cumulated sum of 18.5 percent of GDP by
FY2015).
10.
Repercussions on the RMI from global developments after the Brexit vote are
anticipated to be limited. Due to limited international linkages other than to the United States via
the Compact agreement, the RMI remains fairly isolated from spillovers from external developments.
Even if U.S. growth were to slow or the currency to appreciate, the U.S. grants to the RMI would
remain unchanged at their pre-allocated levels until FY2023. While the RMI’s ship registry business
could be affected by a slowdown in global trade, the registry business itself is conducted by an
offshore entity which is linked to the domestic economy by a pre-determined annual payment to the
RMI government (to be renegotiated in 2019). A possible long-term decline in global asset returns
adds to the existing risk factors for managing the CTF.

The Authorities’ Views
11.
The authorities broadly agreed with the staff assessment on economic outlook.
Economic activity was expected to pick up in 2016, albeit gradually owing to possible delays in the
disbursement of Compact infrastructure grants and the drought in early 2016. They agreed that, over
the medium term, the execution of Compact infrastructure projects will help support growth, while
also agreeing with the view that long-term growth potential will remain limited in the absence of a
decisive structural reform. The authorities agreed that foreign grants would continue to provide
stable funding for current account deficits.
12.
The authorities considered climate change, social security fund liabilities, and public
debt to be the main risks to the outlook. Extreme weather episodes due to climate change, such
as droughts, have adversely affected the country in recent years and are becoming more frequent.
They noted the large looming contingent liabilities from the social security fund, in the absence of a
reform that puts the system on a sustainable path. The authorities also highlighted the still relatively
high level of public and publicly-guaranteed debt as a constraint on future prospects.

SECURING FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY
13.
A medium-term fiscal adjustment is needed to achieve long-term sustainability and
build buffers against existing vulnerabilities. Staff analysis indicates that a fiscal surplus of
3 percent of GDP by FY2023 could help ensure the long-term sustainability of the CTF by preserving
its real value, under the expected nominal return of 5 percent per year.5 This would entail a
cumulative fiscal adjustment of 5 percentages points of GDP over seven years, relative to the
baseline under which the fiscal balance would deteriorate to a deficit of 2 percent of GDP by FY2023.
An adequate adjustment could strengthen fiscal buffers against vulnerabilities including: an
outstanding debt which is one of the highest among Pacific small states, substantial contingent
liability from SOE subsidies and social security system, the volatility in CTF returns, and prospective
costs from climate change.
14.
The staff-recommended surplus target can be attained by undertaking the fiscal
adjustment envisioned in the Decrement



Revenue mobilization. The DMP incorporates a tax reform with an estimated revenue impact of
½ percent of GDP, while a larger revenue mobilization will be possible once the new tax system
is in place. In line with the Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre (PFTAC)
recommendations, staff encourages the authorities to push ahead with the reform which
includes: (i) reforming the personal income tax; (ii) introducing a net profits tax; (iii) introducing a
consumption tax to replace the Gross Revenue Tax (GRT); and (iv) replacing the existing import
duties on alcohol, tobacco, motor vehicles and fuels with excise taxes. While the tax reform is still
under review, the authorities incorporated into revenue a substantial portion of fishing license
fees collected by the Marshall Islands Marine Resource Authority—80 percent of surplus
revenues beyond US$3 million—starting in FY2015.



To facilitate domestic revenue mobilization further, staff also advocates further enhancing tax
administration along the latest PFTAC recommendations, by improving core tax functions such as
tax payers’ services, collection of tax arrears and outstanding returns, and the audit function.6

increase in government funding may be inevitable
during the transition to a new system, but caution is strongly urged to guard against
institutionalizing it or delaying the reform.7

16.
Improving PFM will play a critical role in implementing fiscal adjustment and
safeguarding fiscal sustainability. Staff welcomes the authorities’ renewed focus on PFM reforms,
including on process and human resources management. It is important to move expeditiously
toward the full implementation of this reform, which is much needed given existing weaknesses in
tax administration, budget execution, reporting, and planning that can hamper fiscal adjustment.

6

Strengthened tax audits uncovered tax under-reporting of about ½ percent of GDP per year in FY2013–14.

7

The impact on growth will be small, because the direct income effects of later retirement age and higher
contributions largely offset each other, while indirect (second-round) income effects would be limited by low fiscal
multipliers reflecting the very high openness of the RMI’s island economy.

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF THE MARSHALL ISLANDS

The Authorities’ Views
17.
The authorities agreed with the need for fiscal adjustment to preserve the real value of
CTF. They recognized the necessity to maintain a sizable fiscal surplus and to keep contributing to
the CTF, as recommended by the staff. In FY2016, the authorities contributed US$2.2 million to the
CTF. The authorities agreed that a comprehensive reform is required to make the SSF sustainable and
in May 2016 set up a task force to recommend reform options to the Cabinet and Parliament. The
Ministry of Finance (MoF) was focusing on the human resources management improvement plan as
a cross-cutting foundation to ensure the sustainability of PFM reforms, while rallying broader and
greater support for many other reforms. In particular, tax reform—deemed necessary by the
authorities—might require a recalibration that addresses key concerns of the private sector, before
being resubmitted to the new parliament.

ADAPTING TO CLIMATE CHANGE
18.
The RMI is one of the countries expected to be most affected by climate change and
rising sea levels. Climate change is expected to lead to both structural and cyclical fiscal costs. The
structural component (2.5 percent of GDP per year) is related to the ex-ante cost of preparing for
climate change, including by building coastal protection, and is recognized in the baseline mediumterm fiscal projections and the DSA. The cyclical component (10 percent of GDP over 20 years), due
to extreme weather events, is recognized as a contingent liability shock in the DSA.
19.
Staff supports the authorities’ intensified efforts to mitigate disaster risk and build
resilience. Recognizing that most

RMI has a maximum amount of US$15.6 million (8 percent of GDP) available in ex-ante instruments
to facilitate disaster response, and can also access emergency support from relevant U.S. agencies
(FEMA/USAID) per the Compact agreement.
20.
Staff also recommends explicitly recognizing the adaptation cost in budget and
seeking donor funding. Explicit budgeting will help ensure the continuity—despite medium-term
fiscal adjustment—and efficiency on both spending and funding fronts. The structural expenditure
should incorporate climate-related costs implicit in other line items, including extra construction

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

REPUBLIC OF THE MARSHALL ISLANDS

costs for flood-proof structures. Where possible, donor funding (including from the new Green
Climate Fund) should be sought, considering fiscal constraints of the RMI. Related, the Ministry of
Finance has established a new office—Division of International Development Assistance (DIDA)—to
coordinate all international development assistance, including for climate change. The authorities are
working with the World Bank on the preparation of a Climate Resilience Project for FY2017, which
would help strengthen disaster early warning, improve coastal protection and planning, and provide
contingency funds for emergency response to medium-size hazards, including drought and flooding.

The Authorities’ Views
21.
The authorities agreed on the benefit of strengthening planning capacity, including by
explicitly recognizing climate change related expenditure in the budget. They noted that there
were already many related expenditures, for example in the form of climate-proofing the airport and
schools, but it was viewed to be difficult to track the exact amount for all such expenditures. The
authorities also noted that they would continue to participate in the Pacific Catastrophe Risk
Assessment and Financing Initiative (PCRAFI) pilot insurance program, which provides coverage
against tropical cyclones until October 2018. But they would also seek other recourses—selfinsurance, other donors (e.g. FEMA), or other insurance arrangements—that could cover “mediumsize” risks such as droughts.

FACILITATING PRIVATE SECTOR GROWTH
22.
SOE reforms will be the first step to facilitating private sector development, a necessity
for sustainable growth as external funding declines. The underperforming SOE sector has not
only added to the fiscal burden but may also have limited business opportunities for the private
sector. The authorities made progress by restructuring the Marshall Energy Company (MEC), and by
legislating the State-Owned Enterprise Act in October 2015 (Box 3). The Act, supported mainly by the
ADB, purports to strengthen the corporate governance and monitoring framework, and to turn SOEs
at least as profitable and efficient as comparable businesses. Staff commends the authorities for the
progress made and recommends additional steps: clarifying the justification of subsidies based on
the community service obligations (CSOs) of SOEs, and introducing a centralized monitoring unit for
SOE performance. By increasing the transparency of the communal and commercial operations of
SOEs, these measures would help improve the efficiency of SOEs and reduce government subsidies.
And limiting SOE subsidies to CSOs will strengthen the discipline on SOEs, level the playing field for
commercially viable businesses and improve the environment for private sector growth. On these
grounds, staff advocated upholding the efficiency-enhancing goal of the SOE Act. However, some
counterparts expressed reservations about an amendment to the SOE Act in March 2016, which
raised the limit on the number of public officials who can serve on SOE Boards from one to three,
noting that it may intensify political interference.
23.
The environment for investments could be further improved by reducing other
impediments to doing business. Based on the World Bank’s ease of doing business survey,

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF THE MARSHALL ISLANDS

registering property and resolving insolvency were two major concerns.8 Land registration reforms
can help collateralize properties—thereby improving access to credit—and lower hurdles for longterm land leases by nonresidents—thereby facilitating foreign direct investment (FDI). Introducing an
insolvency law will provide a missing legislative framework for bankruptcy. In that context, some
private sector representatives expressed optimism on potential niche tourism and aquamarine
projects, albeit pending the improvement in tourism-related infrastructure and ease of travel. Staff
agreed that the RMI appeared to have potential comparative advantage in those areas.

Box 3. Marshall Islands: SOE Reforms
SOEs—currently 11 in the RMI—have been incurring losses and receiving government subsidies since
FY2004, with significant macroeconomic consequences due to their size. SOEs have total assets of about
US$150 million (80 percent of GDP) and generate 7.5 percent of total employment.1 They had in FY2014 a
loss of US$9.9 million and subsidies of US$7.4 million (5.3 percent and 4 percent of GDP).

recent decline in oil prices was partly passed on to
consumers through an electricity tariff cut in December 2014—even lowering CPI inflation—while the
tariff rates are still below the cost-recovery level.



The State-Owned Enterprise Act was approved by the parliament in October 2015. This Act
strengthens the corporate governance and monitoring framework, which has been identified as a priority
for better performance. Given the evidence that good corporate governance rests on a

foundation of law and regulation in the long run, many countries are introducing legislation,
ownership rules and guidelines, and monitoring structures to place SOEs on a firm commercial
footing (ADB, 2011).

Four large SOEs that account for 88 percent of total SOE assets are: Marshall Island Ports Authority, National

coverage, and standardized assumptions on business constraints and information availability.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF THE MARSHALL ISLANDS

The Authorities’ Views
24.
There was general agreement about the need to accelerate SOE reforms, in particular
on delineating CSOs and reducing government subsidies. The authorities noted that the
clarification of CSOs is key for the legitimacy of continuing SOE subsidies, and was preparing for the
creation of a monitoring unit within the MoF. This would need to be reinforced with PFM reforms, in
particular in the areas of program audit and budgeting. The SOE Act amendment on the board
composition was to retain the flexibility to tap expertise resident in the public sector. While
acknowledging that there was limited voluntary participation in land registration, the authorities
hoped that registration would get more active with the re-funding of the registry office in FY2017.

ENHANCING FINANCIAL STABILITY
25.
Strengthening the regulatory framework will be critical to safeguard financial stability,
including by strengthening the capacity and oversight authority of the Banking Commission.
Household debt is high, estimated at about 60 percent of total employee’s compensation as of
FY2015. The Banking Commission could consider a ceiling on the debt service ratio, and introduce
stricter criteria on non-performing loan classification. Staff continues to urge the authorities to
broaden the Banking Commission’s oversight to the Marshall Island Development Bank (MIDB) and
supports the MIDB’s effort to refocus on its core mandate of providing commercial lending rather
than consumer loans.
26.
Some progress is being made to respond to challenges related to withdrawal of
correspondent banking relationships (CBRs) (Box 4). The RMI’s sole domestic commercial bank
could lose its CBR with a U.S.-based bank as a result of heightened due diligence by banks in the
United States. The consequent loss of access to the U.S. payment and settlement services, given the
use of the U.S. dollar as legal tender, could disrupt cross-border payments and economic activity, as
well as weaken financial inclusion for outer islands serviced by the domestic bank. In response, the
authorities are drafting a new Anti-Money Laundering (AML) legislation in line with Financial Action
Task Force (FATF) standards and United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC) rules, have
hired external consultants and met with U.S. officials, and also attended in early April a LEG/STIorganized workshop on implementing the international AML/CFT (Combating the Financing of
Terrorism) standards. Staff encouraged the authorities to strengthen the implementation of AML/CFT
requirements, particularly in relation to Know-Your-Customer requirements, and have an open and
regular dialogue with U.S. regulators.
The Authorities’ Views
27.
The authorities agreed on the need to enhance the capacity of the Banking Commission
to carry out inspections. They agreed with the merit of a ceiling on the debt service ratio and
stricter criteria on non-performing loan classification. The Banking Commission shared staff’s view
that the MIDB should be brought under its oversight but highlighted that this would require
legislative action. The authorities also noted that they were making progress on measures against

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF THE MARSHALL ISLANDS

money laundering, and preparing a legislation to have wider oversight power on AML/CFT related
matters.
Box 4. Marshall Islands: Withdrawal of CBRs
Marshall Island’s sole commercial bank’s CBR with a U.S.-based bank has recently become more difficult.
Background. The RMI’s only domestic commercial bank has had a CBR with a U.S.-based bank (First
Hawaiian Bank, a subsidiary of BNP Paribas), and was recently notified that it may terminate the relationship,
due to concerns about the cost of complying with new U.S. regulations, including on AML. As of May 2016,
however, the planned termination of the relationship was put on hold.
Drivers. A recent IMF survey found that many Pacific islands are experiencing negative effects from the
withdrawal of CBRs. Outside the Pacific, there is evidence that similar developments are also taking place in
the Caribbean, Middle East, and North Africa. The terminations of CBRs are due to several factors, including
the enforcement of stricter global regulatory standards, prudential regulations, sanctions, and tax and
AML/CFT requirements. As a result, some business lines are being perceived as too costly in terms of
compliance, and therefore being cut off by global banks.
Offshore companies. According to the latest AML/CFT assessment by the Asia Pacific Group (APG), the
FATF-style regional body of which the RMI is a member, vulnerabilities derive mainly from RMI’s offshore
company registration sector. For registered non-resident entities, there is no mandatory requirement for
legal persons to provide information either on the legal or beneficial ownership of shareholders.
Remittances. The cost of transferring remittances to Pacific islands has increased as global banks have
closed bank accounts of small money transfer operators, forcing transfer of remittances only through banks.
This could be an additional issue for the RMI, given its high reliance on remittances. So far, however, the cost
of transferring remittances to the RMI has not been affected significantly, as almost all the remittances come
through two large operators (MoneyGram and Western Union) that have existing partnerships with banks.

STAFF APPRAISAL
28.
The economy faces the medium-term challenge of coping with the reduction in
Compact grants from the United States after FY2023, climate change, and limited private
sector growth. The fiscal balance is likely to fall into deficit in the medium term without a sustained
fiscal adjustment, undermining long-term self-sufficiency.
29.
Ensuring fiscal sustainability over the medium term calls for decisive fiscal adjustment
and social security reform. Staff encourages that the medium-term budget plans incorporate the
fiscal adjustment plan (envisioned in DMP) in response to the scheduled decline in U.S. Compact
grants until FY2023, complemented by reforms of the social security and tax systems. Welcoming the
formation of a taskforce for social security reform, staff urges timely action to eliminate the risk of a
potentially large drain on the government budget. Staff supports the renewed focus on PFM and
looks forward to further progress.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

REPUBLIC OF THE MARSHALL ISLANDS

30.
Continued vigilance is warranted for both structural and cyclical fiscal costs stemming
from climate change. Staff supports the authorities’ intensified efforts to mitigate natural disaster
risk and build resilience, including through the Joint National Action Plan (JNAP). Explicit budgeting
of adaptation costs would also improve the efficiency on both spending and funding fronts.
31.
SOE reforms should continue, including to facilitate private sector growth. Staff
commends the authorities for restructuring the Marshall Energy Company and enacting the StateOwned Enterprise Act in October 2015. Building on the Act, staff recommends clarifying community
service obligations of SOEs and introducing a centralized monitoring unit for SOE performance.
32.
To ensure financial stability, the regulatory and supervisory framework should be
strengthened. Strengthening the Banking Commission’s regulatory capacity, including by
broadening its oversight to development banks and other entities, continues to be a priority. To deal
with potential challenges related to withdrawal of correspondent banking relationships, the
authorities should continue to address regulatory gaps, including by bringing the AML legislation in
line with international standards, and maintain a close dialogue with the U.S. regulators.
33.
The external position is broadly consistent with underlying fundamentals and risks of
external instability remain limited. The estimated current account gap is small and relatively stable
external funding is available for current account deficits at least until FY2023. Thereafter, external
stability can be enhanced by stronger buffers including an adequate CTF balance (enough to
preserve its real value).
34.
The quality of official statistics is broadly adequate for surveillance, but should be
improved. Efforts to improve the coverage and timeliness of official data, in particular for external
and financial sector statistics would help strengthen surveillance and policy formulation.
35.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the current
24-month cycle.

Appendix I. The Compact Trust Fund and Its
Long-term Outlook
The Compact Trust Fund is expected to build sufficient resources to compensate for expiring Compact
grants in FY2023. But, to preserve the value of the fund in real terms, fiscal surpluses are needed.
The Compact Trust Fund (CTF) was created in 2004 to contribute to the long-term budgetary
self-reliance of the RMI. The fund aims to provide the RMI with an ongoing source of revenue
after the Compact Agreement with the U.S. terminates in FY2023. In particular, US$27 million
(12 percent of GDP) of Compact-related grants are expected to be terminated in FY2024.
Structure of the fund. The contributions to the CTF are not available for withdrawal prior to
FY2024. From FY2024 onwards, annual investment earnings from the CTF can be withdrawn to
finance budget needs up to a limit.1 In years when investment earnings are not sufficiently high, the
C account of the fund can be used to make up for the shortfall.2 A separate account (Account D) to
which the RMI and Taiwan Province of China (POC) have contributed can also be used as a buffer, as
long as its assets exceed US$10 million.
Contributions to the fund. The value of the CTF (excluding the D account) was US$247 million as of
end-FY2015. Of this amount, US$181 million came from contributions, particularly from the RMI
(US$31 million), Taiwan POC (US$21 million), and the United States (US$129 million). Moreover, the
D account of the CTF has received contributions from the RMI and Taiwan POC, and held
US$12 million as of end-FY2015.
Fund performance. The current investment
strategy of the CTF (in place since October 2012)
stipulates that 60 percent of the fund is invested in
equities, while the rest is split between fixed income
(20 percent) and alternative investments
(20 percent). As of end-FY2014, the fund’s average
annual nominal return rate since inception was
6.0 percent, net of fees. As of end-FY2015 (at a
relatively low point in financial markets due to the
summer market turmoil in 2015), the average return
declined to 4.9 percent, although it has bounced
back toward its previous historical average since then.

Governance of the fund. The CTF is administered by an independent committee that exercises
oversight and fiduciary responsibility over the fund (except for the D account). Four voting members
on the committee are appointed by the United States (from Departments of Education, Interior, and

Annual distributions from the CTF, starting in FY2024, can only come from investment earnings from the previous year up to
a maximum limit equivalent to expired grant assistance amount as of FY2023, fully adjusted for inflation.
2

Investment earnings above 6 percent are transferred to the C account of the fund. The C account is capped at three times the
projected grant assistance in FY2023. As of end-FY2015, it held US$48 million (nearly two times the projected amount).

State), two by the RMI, and one by Taiwan POC. A custodian bank (State Street Bank) and
a professional investment advisor (Mercer Investment Management) help manage the fund.
Review. An independent external evaluation of the fund was conducted in FY2015. The review found
the fund to be generally well governed and its service provider performance in line with industry
standards. It recommended working with the investment adviser to apply a “glide path” toward a
more conservative investment strategy to protect capital, as the build-up period nears its end. This
may reduce the volatility and absolute level of returns over time.
Scenarios
Two scenarios are considered to assess the long-term outlook and the implications for RMI’s
fiscal sustainability. Under the baseline scenario, the projected value of the CTF is likely to generate
sufficient income to supplement the expiry of Compact grants in FY2023, but not preserve the real
value of the CTF. In the policy action scenario, the real value of the CTF is preserved.
Baseline scenario. If the fund averages a 5 percent nominal return annually from FY2016 onwards,
the distribution from the estimated assets for
FY2024 would probably provide revenue
equivalent to about 132 percent of the Amended
Compact’s Section 211(a) FY2023 sector grant
level. Under this scenario, however, long-term
self-sufficiency would not be secured because
the real value of the CTF will likely decline over
time. Therefore, in the baseline scenario, the
government would either need to erode the real
value of the CTF or face a large budgetary
shortfall (about 3 percent of GDP). Moreover, it
should be noted that even achieving this simple
level of sufficiency does not eliminate the risk of subsequent fiscal shocks if the CTF investment
returns are weak for a number of years.
Policy action scenario. Under this scenario, the government is assumed to undertake a fiscal
adjustment of 5 percent of GDP over the medium-term (from FY2017 to FY2023) to build a budget
surplus of 3 percent of GDP by FY2023 and transfer the surpluses to the CTF. Under this course of
action, the real value of the CTF would be preserved.
Sensitivity to investment returns. However, this outcome is sensitive to the assumption on CTF
annual investment returns, which have been volatile in the past. By staff estimates, a 0.5 percentage
point decrease in expected returns would increase the fiscal adjustment need to by 1 percentage
point of GDP from the suggested policy action scenario.

Reduction of public payroll

Nominal growth of public wage in FY2013-14 was better
contained than in the past. However, FY2015 public wage bill
increased, reflecting higher employee qualifications in health
and education.

-

Reduction of subsidies to SOEs

After falling in FY2014, SOE subsidies increased in FY2015
including due to capital expenditures. The SOE Act was
legislated in FY2015.

-

Legislative approval of revenue reforms

Bills to comprehensively reform the tax system are under
review, but need to be resubmitted in the new parliament

-

Better public financial management

The Cabinet approved medium-term PFM Reform Roadmap
(PFTAC TA). A progress report was prepared in October 2015.
Currently focused on human resources management.

1/ The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to
materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the
baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and
“high” a probability between 30 and 50 percent). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of
concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.
The blue arrows indicate whether the risk is to the upside or downside.

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
The Bank and the Fund teams maintain a close working relationship and have an ongoing
dialogue on macroeconomic and structural issues. The teams agreed that the RMI’s main
macroeconomic challenge is to secure fiscal sustainability by maintaining adequate fiscal balance
and building buffers against existing fiscal vulnerabilities. Based on this shared assessment, the
teams identified these reform areas as critical in view of their central role in achieving fiscal
sustainability and fostering equitable growth: (i) public sector enterprise reform to reduce the drain
on public finances and provide reliable services supporting private sector development;
(ii) recognizing climate change adaptation and response costs on both spending and funding fronts;
and (iii) enhancing financial sector stability, including addressing challenges from potential derisking activities of international banks.
The teams agreed on close cooperation going forward and the table below lists the teams’
separate and joint work programs during 2016 and 2017. Since gaining IDA eligibility, RMI has
received grants in support of ICT sector reforms in the form of: (i) a US$3 million ICT-focused
Development Policy Operation, disbursed in June 2013; and (ii) a US$1.25 million grant from the
Pacific Regional Infrastructure Facility. In addition, the RMI has received grants in support of the

RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
The Asian Development Bank (AsDB) has been working with the Government of the RMI since 1990
and has approved 14 loans for $92.63 million, 50 technical assistance projects for $21.48 million, and
5 grants for $11.06 million. Cumulative disbursements for lending and grants financed by Ordinary
Capital Resources (OCR), the Asian Development Fund (ADF), and other special funds amount to
$79.3 million.
In recent years, AsDB has helped the RMI in a variety of development areas. In 2012, AsDB approved
the second subprogram under the Public Sector Program, broadening and deepening the work of
the first subprogram. Subprogram 2 helped the RMI to adopt and implement reform plans to
improve the performance of selected state-owned enterprises (SOEs), complete a public sector
workforce audit and planning exercise, and achieve various expenditure targets. In the same year,
three technical assistance projects were approved. These included support for implementing the
government’s new national development plan, implementation of the RMI’s early grade learning
assessments at selected primary schools, and preparations for the Ebeye Water and Sanitation
Project. A technical assistance grant was also approved in 2012, under the Water Financing
Partnership Facility, to enhance water sector operations in Majuro, the RMI’s most populous atoll.
In 2013, AsDB approved two grants totaling $300,000, under its Asia Pacific Disaster Response Fund,
to help the RMI counter the impacts of a drought that had affected the country earlier in the year.
In 2015, AsDB approved the Ebeye Water and Sanitation Project, which aims to reduce the incidence
of waterborne diseases by improving access to safe water and sanitation on the island. AsDB, with
financing from the Government of Australia, is helping to implement three community projects
under the “quickwins” banner. The projects will upgrade the Ebeye drainage system to mitigate
flooding; construct new saltwater wells to increase the yield of saltwater to the island’s desalination
plant; and establish a community radio station to help disburse information on, and increase
awareness of, safe water use.
Through regional technical assistance projects, AsDB has helped the RMI improve governance within
SOEs and develop SOE policy and legislation, which was passed by the country’s parliament in
September 2015. AsDB has helped the government develop a financial management model and,
through the AsDB national development coordination officer, provided technical support on
accounting to the Ministry of Finance.
The Country Operations Business Plan (COBP) 2016–18 for the RMI has four areas of strategic focus
to support the country’s medium-term development: better and more sustainable infrastructure,
improved quality of basic education, better public sector management, and the implementation of
structural reform. These strategic pillars align with the core priorities identified in the government’s
NSDP, while also reflecting AsDB’s Interim Pacific Approach, 2015 and the Midterm Review of
Strategy 2020, AsDB’s corporate strategy.

REPUBLIC OF THE MARSHALL ISLANDS

The government has sought AsDB assistance for development issues on the country’s outer islands,
and to further improve the quality of basic education. AsDB will support integrated strategic
planning for investments in renewable energy and the institutional strengthening of the Ministry of
Finance. Future AsDB operations will also be complemented by regional technical assistance
programs, particularly in the areas of economic management, private sector development, and
public sector management.

RELATIONS WITH THE PACIFIC FINANCIAL TECHNICAL
ASSISTANCE CENTRE
The Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre’s (PFTAC)1 assistance to the RMI during the past
years has focused on public financial management, revenue administration, financial supervision,
and macroeconomic analysis and forecasting through missions, regional seminars and workshops.
Public Financial Management
Following PFTAC’s joint work with authorities in 2011 on a Public Expenditure and Financial
Accountability assessment, assistance was provided in 2013 to develop a draft Public Financial
Management (PFM) reform Roadmap which was approved by the Cabinet in 2015. Future TA in RMI
is expected to focus on supporting the authorities to finalize the roadmap, including moving
towards medium-term budgeting, modernization of legislation and financial instructions and
strengthened cash management, accounting and financial reporting. In 2013 PFTAC provided
assistance in analyzing the funding situation for the Social Security fund and developing options to
improve its sustainability. A Pension Workshop was held in April 2016 in coordination with MISSA,
PFTAC, and IMF's Expenditure Policy Division; and TA was provided to the Ministry of Finance in May
2016 on improving medium-term expenditure and revenue forecasting in cooperation with PFTAC's
Macro-Economics Advisor.
Revenue Administration
In 2008, the Minister of Finance set up the Tax and Revenue Reform and Modernization Commission
(TRRM) to make recommendations to reform the revenue collection system and to strengthen the
capabilities and effectiveness of the Division of Customs, Treasury, Revenue and Taxation (DCTRT).
The TRRM reported back in 2010 and recommended a comprehensive revenue reform to introduce
an income tax and domestic sales tax. Subsequent PFTAC advice highlighted revenue leakage in the
sales tax proposal and the recommendation was changed to introduce a VAT. Since then PFTAC
provided assistance to develop a high level implementation plan for the revenue reforms (2010);
helped draft legislation for the income tax, VAT and excise taxes and revenue administration
activities (2010–11); and has continued to support the DCTRT in revenue administrative reforms and
provided assistance in the development of a Strategic and Operational Plan in 2015. More recently,
and after the November, 2015 elections, DCTRT advised that the new Government had signaled its
intention to resurrect the tax reform which had stalled over the last few years.
Financial Sector Regulation and Supervision
At the request of the Commissioner, an Advisor visited the Banking Commission in July 2008,
January 2010 and February 2011. The focus of the missions was to strengthen the capacity of the
authorities to conduct off-site surveillance of banks with a number of recommendations to improve

the prudential reporting requirements for banks, and the expansion of the off-site monitoring
database. The visits included providing hands-on training and support to Commission staff in
assessing credit risk in the bank’s loan portfolio through the use of financial statement analysis,
reviewing the appropriateness of loan repayment structures and repayment histories, and assessing
the adequacy of collateral. The visit also resulted in the development of a standardized examination
report to assist the Commission in presenting examination findings and recommendations. At the
request of the Commission, a draft regulation to clarify and ensure the proper calculation of the
single borrower limit (Section 130(1)(a) of the Banking Act) was also prepared during this period.
The Banking Commission is a member of the Association of Financial Supervisors of Pacific
Countries (AFSPC), which is supported by PFTAC, and has benefited from participation in the AFSPC
annual meetings and associated regional training workshops provided by PFTAC on financial
supervision issues. In 2015, a new Banking Commissioner was appointed with a new team. A training
and development needs assessment needs to be performed in light of the complete staff turnover.
Economic and Financial Statistics
The Economic Policy, Planning and Statistics Office (EPPSO) has received significant training since
2005 on balance of payments and national accounts statistics. In recent years, PFTAC statistics
advisors have delivered an annual sub-regional national accounts course to compilers from RMI as
well as Palau and the Federated States of Micronesia, as all three countries use variants of a
common compilation system that is run by two external consultants. They are funded by the U.S.
Department of Interior and visit RMI annually to update the national accounts and also BOP
statistics for inclusion in the Annual Compact Report.
The consultants’ mandate is to produce estimates rather than train staff; as a result, staff from RMI
lacked knowledge and confidence in this field and so the courses sought to teach them what the
systems did as well as bolstering their compilation and analytical skills. The most recent course was
run in April 2016 and focused on the use of household income and expenditure data in estimating
GDP, rebasing and practical skills for compilation and reporting. It has been highlighted as one of
PFTAC’s success stories in terms of sustainability as staff are proving to be much more capable and
independent. Following the conclusion of the JSA project in 2015, a PFTAC-funded government
finance statistics mission is scheduled for September 2016.
Macroeconomic analysis and forecasting
Work commenced with the Ministry of Finance in April 2016 to improve medium-term budgeting
and fiscal planning. Technical Assistance is being provided jointly with the PFTAC Public Financial
Management Advisor. A Financial Management Model (FMM), which was developed by the Asian
Development Bank, is being modified so that projections are consistent with macroeconomic
forecasts produced by external consultants, and information on likely medium-term cost increases
due to demographic flows and past decisions on policy enhancements and approved projects.
Moreover, the usability of the FMM is being enhanced so that it can be used to analyze the impact
of economic shocks or proposed policy changes on key variables such as cash reserves and public
debt. Participants from the RMI took part in workshops on Medium-term Expenditure Planning for
National Sustainable Development in November 2015 and on Forecasting Tax Revenues in April 2016.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
(As of June 2016)
General: Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance and the authorities willingly share available data, though
some shortcomings tend to constrain policy analysis, especially on trade statistics. The Economic Policy, Planning and
Statistics Office (EPPSO) was established in February 2003 and took efforts in building local capacity to collect and
disseminate economic and social statistics. Through the close collaboration of EPPSO and various ministries, an external
consultant team in the Pacific Islands Training Initiative (www.pitiviti.org), funded by the U.S. Department of Interior,
prepares a comprehensive set of annual statistics covering key areas beginning FY2008. Previously, extensive Fund
technical assistance was provided through the Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Center (PFTAC) in preparation of
the balance of payments and national account statistics. Data shortcomings include the coverage and timeliness of
data releases.
National Accounts: National income accounts from (the latest data through FY2015) have been prepared by the
external consultants dating back to FY1997, though the official website lags far behind in presenting what is available.
Some shortcomings remain, for instance, investment, consumption and savings indicators are not available. The
national census was conducted in early 2011.
Employment: Data on employment and wages are available and classified by sectors based on the filings to Social
Security Administration. However, no unemployment data are available.
Price statistics: The new consumer price index (CPI), rebased in 2003Q1, and replaced the previous CPI developed in
the 1980s. The updated CPI is based on the information from the Household Income and Expenditure Survey 2002,
conducted with assistance from the U.S. Department of the Interior and the U.S. Census Bureau.
Government finance: Fiscal data are regularly compiled for budget control, and with the help of the consultants they
are consolidated into a format suitable for analysis. Annual financial audits on the central government and component
units were published. The RMI presents fiscal data using Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001)
format and has submitted data to the Government Financial Statistics Yearbook for 2008–13. Recent TA work
successfully mapped various elements to GFSM 2014 to enable public sector consolidation.
Monetary statistics: A reporting system has been established for domestic banking institutions on the basis of monthly
reporting forms and guidelines developed by the 1993 STA mission. Even though data are reported by banks to the
Banking Commissioner, they are not published or reported to the Fund. Tables on basic balance sheet items as well as
income and expenses are prepared for inclusion in the Annual Compact Report.
Balance of payments: The EPPSO has made important progress in the improvement of Marshall Islands’ ESS during
the JSA ESS Project. The sixth edition of the Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual (BPM6)
was adopted and balance of payments and international investment position (IIP) statistics started to be submitted to
STA in 2014. Following the implementation of a unit dedicated to the compilation of statistics, the EPPSO took over
the ownership of ESS compilation, currently conducted solely by external consultants. Nevertheless, the unit is staffed
by a sole compiler and some reliance on the consultants still remains. Further actions still need to be undertaken by
the EPSSO to collect proper data on external debt statistics (EDS), foreign direct investment (FDI) statistics, and proper
data on banks’ external assets and liabilities.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION—
DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Approved By

Ranil Salgado and
Andrea Richter Hume
(IMF), and Satu
Kahkonen (IDA)

Prepared by staff of the International Monetary Fund and the
International Development Association.

The 2016 Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) assesses that the Republic of the Marshall Islands
(RMI) remains at high risk of debt distress. Currently, the ratios of the present value (PV) of
external public and publicly-guaranteed (PPG) debt to GDP and exports are above their
respective policy-dependent indicative thresholds. Moreover, the PV of the external debt-toGDP ratio is expected to remain above its indicative threshold throughout the entire projection
period and, for most indicators of external debt, indicative thresholds would be breached under
stress test scenarios. Although the RMI does not currently face any debt servicing risk due to
concessionality of debt obligations and access to a stable flow of funds from Compact grants
until FY2023, risks from contingent liabilities and lack of fiscal buffers call for a fiscal reform
strategy. Thus, the government needs to adhere to its existing consolidation plans to generate
sufficient fiscal surpluses by FY2023 to shore up the Compact Trust Fund, while safeguarding
social spending and economic growth.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

1

REPUBLIC OF THE MARSHALL ISLANDS

BACKGROUND
1.
The RMI’s PPG debt is almost entirely external. According to the limited data available,
the domestic component—held by domestic banks—is only 6 percent of the total. Private sector
external debt is also estimated to be small, representing less than 2 percent of GDP.
2.
PPG external debt has been on a downward trajectory since the early 2000s. It declined
from 73.7 percent of GDP in FY2002 to 49.1 percent of GDP at end FY2015. About two-thirds is
central government debt contracted with the Asian Development Bank (AsDB) on concessional
terms, while the remainder is state-owned enterprise (SOE) debt guaranteed by the government.
3.
The analysis is based on the standard DSA framework for low-income countries (LICs).
The framework assesses the evolution of debt against the respective policy-dependent indicative
thresholds to ascertain debt sustainability.1 RMI’s policies and institutions, as measured by the CPIA,
averaged 2.7 over the past 3 years. Hence the country is classified as a “weak” performer and is
assessed against relatively lower debt thresholds.

UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS
4.
The economy is estimated to have returned to a positive growth in FY2015, led by the
fishery sector, and is expected to expand further in FY2016. Following a contraction in FY2014,
real GDP growth was estimated at 0.4 percent in FY2015 and is expected to rise to 1.4 percent in
FY2016, as the effects of the drought earlier this year are offset by the resumption of Compactfunded infrastructure spending. The fiscal balance is estimated to have recorded a surplus of 3
percent of GDP in FY2014–15, due to record-high fishing license fees. It is projected to decline to a
smaller surplus in FY2016 and, without reforms, to a deficit of 2 percent of GDP over the medium
term due to the steady decline in Compact grants until FY2023. Potential GDP growth is projected to
be 1-1.5 percent over the medium term, absent structural reforms. Box 1 summarizes the mediumterm macroeconomic framework underlying this DSA update, which is also consistent with the
outlook for the Compact Trust Fund (CTF) summarized in Box 2.

EXTERNAL DSA
5.
Under the baseline scenario, RMI’s external PPG debt trajectory remains above the
indicative threshold for a protracted period of time. The present value (PV) of external PPG debt
is estimated at 40.0 percent of GDP in FY2015, 10 percentage points above the indicative threshold
of 30 percent and is not anticipated to fall below that limit over the projection period. Debt
accumulation is expected to remain positive at least until FY2036, reflecting government deficit

1

The low-income country debt sustainability framework recognizes that better policies and institutions allow
countries to manage higher levels of debt, and thus the threshold levels for debt indicators are policy-dependent. In
particular, the quality of a country’s policies and institutions is measured by the World Bank’s Country Policy and
Institutional Assessment (CPIA) index and classified into three categories: strong, medium, and weak. For the analysis,
a 5 percent discount rate is assumed for present value calculations.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF THE MARSHALL ISLANDS

financing. The grant element of new borrowing is expected to increase after FY2018, as the share of
concessional loans from multilateral partners in the financing mix is projected to rise. The PV of
external PPG debt-to-export ratio is currently above the indicative threshold of 100 percent, but is
projected to fall below it in FY2017, thanks to the projected export expansion. The PV of external PPG
debt-to-revenue ratio is currently below the indicative threshold of 200 percent, and expected to
remain below it during the projection period. As most of external PPG debt is on concessional terms,
the debt service to export and revenue ratios are expected to remain below the indicative thresholds
over the long-term horizon.
6.
Stress tests confirm the vulnerability of the debt position relative to GDP, exports, and
revenues. In the most extreme shock scenario—with export value growth in FY2017–18 one
standard deviation below the historical average—the PV of the debt-to-export ratio would remain
above its relevant threshold at the end of the projection period. The debt service-to-exports ratio
would also remain above its indicative threshold at least until FY2036. These highlight the sensitivity
of the external debt position to exports, including in fishing, which historically had high volatility.
Under a more benign scenario whereby key macroeconomic variables are assumed at their historical
averages—characterized by positive primary balances—the PV of the debt-to-GDP, and debt-toexports would fall below their indicative thresholds in FY2016. 2

PUBLIC DSA
7.
Total PPG debt follows very closely the dynamics of PPG external debt. The PV of PPG
debt-to-GDP and to revenue ratios is projected to decline very slowly over the projection period. The
debt dynamics is particularly sensitive to growth shocks. Under the most extreme shock, the PV of
debt-to-GDP and debt-to-revenue would remain on an upward trend at least until FY2036. Under
a shock to the primary balance, the debt service-to-revenue ratio would also keep growing
throughout the projection period.

THE AUTHORITIES VIEWS
8.
The authorities agreed with the DSA findings, noting that the current risk of debt
distress is high. They saw the need for fiscal adjustment and improvements in public financial
management. They emphasized that a Decrement Management Plan (DMP) was developed to
implement a fiscal adjustment in the face of declining Compact grants. They also noted that the
Public Financial Management Reform Roadmap (PFMRR) was adopted in August 2014. The Ministry
of Finance is leading the effort in implementing its recommendations and targeted activities,
including financial accountability, transparency and budget oversight, and aid coordination.

2

Holding the set of key variables related to debt dynamics at ten-year averages does not appear to provide a relevant
comparator to the baseline. In particular, the scenario in which variables are at their historical levels is regarded as too
benign due to historically smaller current account deficits that were financed in the past by large one-off FDI.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF THE MARSHALL ISLANDS

However, these efforts continue to require consistent attention and action to realize the full benefit
of the Reform Roadmap.

CONCLUSIONS
9.
The standard DSA framework for LICs suggests that the RMI is at high risk of debt
distress. The baseline scenario indicates that the PV of the external debt-to-GDP ratio would breach
the indicative threshold throughout the entire projection period. Furthermore, stress tests suggest
that RMI’s external PPG debt trajectory could remain above relevant thresholds for an even more
protracted period of time. RMI’s vulnerability to debt distress is mitigated by a number of factors:
most debt is on concessional terms and from development partners; the decline in external support
from the Compact will be gradual, sheltering the country from the risk of a sudden stop in foreign
financing; and the government is building up the CTF that will provide a stable source of funding
after FY2023. On the other hand, vulnerabilities are exacerbated by the lack of fiscal buffers,
uncertainty about prospective SOE losses, contingent liabilities from climatic events, the social
security system, and uncertainty on prospective income returns from the CTF. Thus, the government
needs to adhere to its existing consolidation plans to generate sufficient fiscal surpluses by FY2023
to shore up the Compact Trust Fund, while safeguarding social spending and economic growth.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF THE MARSHALL ISLANDS

Box 1. Marshall Islands: Macroeconomic Assumptions
The key assumptions of the 2016 DSA are consistent with the macroeconomic framework outlined in the 2016 Article
IV Report. Relative to the previous DSA, short-term indicators have improved somewhat mainly due to the upward
revision of fiscal revenues, notably from fishing license fees, but the long-term dynamics remain broadly unchanged.
GDP growth is projected to rise from 0.4 percent in FY2015 to 1.3 percent over the medium term. The mediumterm projections reflect the decline in Compact grants and limited private sector expansion.
The GDP deflator is expected to remain about 1 percentage point below CPI inflation growth, at around 1
percent.
A fiscal deficit of around 1–3 percent of GDP is projected in FY2020–36. The wage bill is assumed to remain
constant as a percent of GDP beyond FY2020, while subsidies to SOEs are assumed to decline very moderately in
real terms. On the revenue side, Compact grants in nominal terms are projected to decrease according to
schedule, while grants from other donors are expected to remain stable at an annual average of about 12 percent
of GDP. The tax revenues-to-GDP ratio is assumed to remain broadly unchanged at around 15 percent of GDP, as
the baseline scenario does not incorporate any tax reforms. Fishing license fees are assumed to increase
moderately. Beyond FY2023, expenditures are expected to follow trends in revenues and grants.
External financing: In the absence of access to the international capital market and a very limited domestic
market, the financing gap is assumed to be financed by a combination of bilateral loans from development
partners and multilateral concessional lending. The annual interest rate on bilateral loans is assumed at 3 percent,
consistent with the rate currently charged to public entities by bilateral development partners. In the medium
term, it is assumed that the RMI will also be eligible for IDA-like concessional lending.
The Compact Trust Fund (CTF) outlook is summarized in Box 2.
The current account deficit (including official transfers) is expected to gradually deteriorate from 1.6 percent of
GDP in FY2015 to around 5 percent of GDP by FY2023 and remain at that level thereafter. The deficit is assumed to
be financed by a combination of bilateral loans from development partners and multilateral concessional lending.

Box 2. Brief Overview of the Compact Trust Fund Under the Baseline Scenario
The Compact Trust Fund (CTF) was established in FY2004 to contribute to the long-term budgetary selfreliance of the RMI after most of the recurrent Compact sector grants expire in FY2023. The CTF is
administered by an independent committee formed by representatives from the RMI, United States, and Taiwan
Province of China, and is managed by a professional investment advisor. The RMI’s contributions to the CTF have
not been steady over the years and depend on the country’s fiscal position. Contributions have been mainly
provided by the United States, followed by Taiwan Province of China. From FY2024 onwards, income returns from
the CTF can be withdrawn to finance budget needs, under some limitations.
Under the baseline scenario, the CTF is assumed to yield an average annual nominal return of 5 percent, in
line with the historical track record. Under this assumption, long-term self-sufficiency will not be secured
because the real value of the CTF will decline over time, even though income flows in the years immediately after
FY2023 are expected to be sufficient to cover the anticipated reduction in grants. Compact-related grants are
expected to be reduced by US$27 million in FY2024, while CTF’s investment earnings are projected at US$36
million. As the gap between investment returns and grant reduction is expected to be too small to compensate for
inflation, the real value of the fund is projected to start declining in FY2024. These projections are sensitive to the
assumption on CTF annual investment returns, which have been quite volatile in the past.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange
rate changes. This line item also reflects projected capital transfers for investment projects.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

Statement by Grant Johnston, Second Alternate Executive Director for Republic
of the Marshall Islands and Nancy Jane Lelang, Advisor
July 25, 2016
On behalf of our authorities in the Republic of Marshall Islands (RMI) we welcome the staff
report and thank the mission team for its productive engagement and policy advice. Our
authorities agree with staff on the challenges facing the country and the need to build fiscal
sustainability. They also commend the mission team for its particular focus on climate
change adaption, which is a major issue for the RMI given its natural geographical features.
The RMI comprises small, sparsely-populated and low-lying atolls and islands spread across
750,000 square miles of the Pacific Ocean. Its extreme remoteness, low population, small
private sector and narrow production base means the country is highly dependent on external
aid, with grants making up over half of government revenue. The RMI is very low lying,
with an average elevation of only 2 meters, and is regularly affected by flooding, storms and
drought.
The country’s immediate fiscal challenges are shaped by the forthcoming expiry of many
current grants made under the Compact of Free Association. In 2023, these will be replaced
by ongoing distributions from an investment fund – the Compact Trust Fund (CTF) – which
is currently being built up through contributions from the United States, Taiwan POC and the
RMI itself. However, the current track for contributions, together with expected investment
returns, is not enough to ensure that the CTF can replace the expiring grants each year and
also maintain the Fund’s real value over time. There are two other major fiscal risks. The
RMI’s State-owned Enterprises (SOEs) make up a significant part of the economy but
persistently make losses and require government subsidies. The Social Security Fund (SSF) – a
government-run, defined-benefit pension scheme – currently has assets of around US$70
million but, under current settings, could be depleted by 2023 as the payment of pension
benefits rises.
Economic outlook
Authorities broadly agree with the staff assessment on the RMI’s economic outlook.
They agree that, over the medium term, Compact infrastructure projects will help support
growth, but that long-term growth potential – estimated at 1-1.5 percent – will remain limited
in the absence of decisive structural reforms. The authorities consider climate change to be
one of the main risks to the outlook, as extreme weather episodes have adversely affected the
country in recent years and are becoming more frequent. They note the large looming
contingent liabilities from the SSF in the absence of reform to put the system on a sustainable
path. The authorities also highlight the relatively high level of public and publicly-guaranteed
debt as a constraint on future prospects.
Fiscal sustainability
The RMI authorities agree with the need to undertake a fiscal adjustment and to
transfer resulting surpluses to the CTF in the period leading up to 2023. Staff calculate
that an adjustment of 5 percent of GDP over this period, to build a budget surplus of 3
percent, would be required to replace the expiring Compact grants and preserve the real value of
the CTF. As the report points out, however, this is sensitive to assumptions around

2
investment returns. Authorities agree with the recommendation made by the independent
external evaluator that the CTF adopt a more conservative investment strategy heading
towards 2023, given that 80 percent of the fund is currently invested in equities and alternative
investments. The RMI is expected to post a surplus of 2.3 percent in 2016 and has made a
contribution of US$2.2 million to the CTF. Going forward, authorities will look to find
expenditure savings across agencies, while protecting the health and education sectors, as
envisioned in the Decrement Management Plan and complemented by additional reforms.
Authorities agree that comprehensive reform is required to put the SSF on a
sustainable path, as under current settings it could be depleted by 2023. They have
drafted a reform bill which is currently being discussed in workshops amongst stakeholders. A
committee has been established to modify this bill to promote sustainability and at the same
time ensure vulnerable older people are protected. Authorities advise that good communication
and education will be required around these social security reforms.
Implementing public financial management reforms is another important policy
priority. Authorities intend to make progress in areas that need improvement like
accounting, auditing, budgeting, human resource capacity and information, as well as updating
the current financial management information system. They are seeking technical assistance
and funding support from donors to assist in implementing these reforms.
On the revenue side, new measures will be introduced in a coordinated manner to
balance the need for consolidation with implications for growth. Authorities are intending to
resubmit tax reform proposals to the new parliament after consultation with the private sector,
and are securing technical assistance to help draft several tax bills. They advise that the first
bill will be to establish an improved and independent revenue-collecting agency. This is
expected to generate additional government revenue through improving core tax functions
such as taxpayers’ services, auditing, and collection of tax arrears and outstanding returns.
Subsequent tax reform bills are intended in line with recommendations from the Pacific
Financial Technical Assistance Centre although may require some recalibration that addresses
key concerns of the private sector.
There is general agreement about the need to accelerate SOE reforms, in particular to
reduce overall government subsidies and make it clear where remaining subsidies exist as
a result of specific community service obligations on those SOEs. Authorities have already
restructured the Marshalls Energy Company to improve governance and financial
performance. The State-Owned Enterprise Act was passed in October 2015 to strengthen
corporate governance and monitoring of SOEs, and authorities are preparing for the creation of
an SOE monitoring unit within the Ministry of Finance. They note comments in the report about
an increase in the limit on the number of public officials allowed to serve on SOE boards
but make the point that this change was to retain flexibility to tap expertise resident in the public
sector.
Financial stability
RMI authorities remain committed to strengthening the country’s financial sector and
working to resolve issues with correspondent banks and their home authorities. They
agree on the need to enhance the capacity, oversight and autonomy of the Banking

3
Commission but highlighted that bringing the Marshall Island Development Bank (MIDB)
under the Commission’s oversight would require legislation. For its own part, the MIDB is
refocusing on its core mandate of providing commercial lending, rather than making consumer
loans. As with other small island states, the potential loss of correspondent banking relationships
is a very significant concern to the RMI authorities. To help prevent this, authorities are
preparing legislation to bring AML/CFT rules into line with international standards. They
appreciate the constructive engagement they have had with U.S. regulators and the assistance
they have received in preparing to reform the financial sector. They intend to request stronger
support, and in particular funding support, to implement the necessary reforms.
Climate change and natural disasters
The RMI is expected to be one of the countries most affected by climate change and
rising sea levels. Our authorities appreciate the continued support the RMI receives from
members of the international community. Authorities have intensified their efforts to mitigate
natural disaster risks including through the Joint National Action Plan that contains climate
change adaption and disaster risk management strategies. Examples of projects include
constructing sea walls, distributing water tanks and building disaster-resilient infrastructure.
Authorities agree on the benefit of strengthening planning capacity, including by
explicitly identifying and reporting on climate change-related elements in the budget.
This explicit budgeting of adaption costs could support access to donor funding, which the
authorities would welcome given the RMI’s current fiscal position. The RMI would therefore
appreciate any technical assistance that could help authorities track such expenditures, as
doing so with accuracy is a significant challenge. The RMI is a member of the Pacific
Catastrophe Risk Assessment and Financing Initiative pilot insurance program which
provides coverage against tropical cyclones until October 2018. But it will also seek other
means – self-insurance, other donors or other insurance arrangements – that could cover
“medium-sized” risks such as droughts and floods.
