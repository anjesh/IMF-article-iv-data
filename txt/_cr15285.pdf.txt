IMF Executive Board Completes Sixth Review Under Stand-By Arrangement for Tunisia
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today completed the sixth
review of Tunisia’s economic performance under a 24-month program supported by a StandBy Arrangement (SBA). The completion of the sixth review enables the immediate
disbursement of SDR 214.875 million (about US$301.6 million), bringing total
disbursements under the arrangement to SDR 1 billion (about US$ 1.41 billion).
The two-year SBA in the amount of SDR 1.146 billion (about US$1.61 billion, 400 percent
of Tunisia’s quota) was approved by the Executive Board on June 7, 2013 (See Press Release
No. 13/202). On May 11, 2015, the Executive Board approved a 7-month extension of the
SBA to December 31, 2015 to provide time for the Tunisian authorities to implement the
policy measures needed to deliver forward-looking commitments – notably on the banking
and fiscal reforms- which will help reduce vulnerabilities and spur higher and inclusive
growth.
In completing the sixth review, the Executive Board approved the authorities’ requests to rephase purchases under the arrangement.
Following the Executive Board’s discussion on Tunisia, Mr. Mitsuhiro Furusawa, Deputy
Managing Director and Acting Chair issued the following statement:
“Tunisia’s economy has been resilient in a context marked by a prolonged political transition
and a difficult international economic environment. All quantitative performance criteria
under the Fund-supported program have been met. However, progress on structural reforms,
including in the banking and fiscal areas, has been challenging. The successful completion of
the political transition represents a good opportunity to press ahead with reform
implementation and complete the unfinished agenda within the program timeline.
“The 2015 fiscal stance is appropriate to mitigate the economic fallout from the recent
terrorist attacks, but a resumption of fiscal consolidation from 2016 remains essential to
reduce vulnerabilities. Better budget composition—including through wage bill containment,
energy subsidy reform, and a tax policy aimed at promoting greater equity and efficiency—is
needed to create space for priority investment spending. Growth-friendly reforms, including

2

of public enterprises, public financial management, and tax administration will improve
absorptive capacity, equity, and risk management.
“A prudent monetary policy would continue to contain inflationary pressures, preserve
positive real interest rates and reduce exchange rate pressures. Greater exchange rate
flexibility—including through limiting foreign exchange interventions to smoothing large
fluctuations—would help strengthen reserve buffers and correct external imbalances.
“In order to strengthen the banking system and facilitate financial sector intermediation, it is
important to recapitalize all three public banks and to update underlying business plans so as
to ensure regulatory compliance throughout the restructuring period. A modernized banking
resolution and supervisory framework and an effective bankruptcy framework are also key.
“Boosting growth and creating jobs requires an improved business environment. Faster
implementation of the structural reform agenda, particularly to strengthen the investment
climate and labor markets is encouraged.”

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2015 Article IV Consultation with Tunisia
On September 30, 2015, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV Consultation with Tunisia1.
Tunisia’s economy has been resilient throughout a protracted political transition and a difficult
international economic environment. The country has been facing headwinds from security
threats and social tensions, which are offsetting the benefits from the successful conclusion of
the political transition, lower international oil prices, and a recovering Europe.
After successfully recovering from the trough of 2011, growth momentum has waned in early
2015, with GDP growth averaging 1.2 percent (y-o-y) for the first semester as activity in the
manufacturing, tourism, and mining sectors slowed significantly. At the same time,
unemployment has been persistently high. Headline inflation dropped to 4.2 percent in July,
reflecting lower food prices and a prudent monetary policy.
External imbalances remain high. Weak tourism receipts, buoying imports (especially energy
and capital goods imports), and declining oil and phosphate exports widened the current account
deficit to 8.8 percent of GDP in 2014, its highest level since the 1980s. Exceptional olive oil
exports and declining energy imports narrowed the deficit in the early part of 2015, but this
improvement is not expected to last as tourism revenues—which were significantly impacted by
the Bardo and Sousse attacks—are expected to drop this year. Reserve buffers are holding up,
helped by a successful international bond issuance earlier in the year.
The fiscal situation improved, with the structural fiscal deficit declining to 3.3 percent of GDP
in 2014 due to strong revenue collection. However, the budget composition weakened as public
investment—which is necessary to sustain growth—has reached record lows of 4.2 percent of
GDP while the wage bill—representing about 60 percent of revenues—rose. The 2015 revised
budget accommodates the short-term fallout of the recent economic slowdown, including
through increased security expenditures and transfers to SMEs.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and
discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the
staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

2

The banking system remains fragile, with the system’s capital adequacy ratio below the
minimum regulatory requirement. At 15.8 percent, non-performing loans of the banking sector
continue to be high. Low deposit growth is keeping public banks structurally illiquid, increasing
banks’ recourse to CBT refinancing. Against this background, private sector credit growth
remains modest, with its level well below potential.
The medium-term prospects remain favorable—with growth projected to increase to 4.7 percent
by 2020. They hinge on reduced security risks and easing of social tensions, and the successful
and quick implementation of comprehensive reforms that improve the business climate and
foster private sector development.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors agreed with the thrust of the staff appraisal. They commended the authorities
for maintaining macroeconomic stability in the context of a prolonged political transition and a
difficult international economic environment. While all quantitative performance criteria under
the Fund-supported program have been met, progress on structural reforms has been challenging.
Directors regretted the recent terrorist attacks, which weakened confidence and growth in 2015,
and expressed their support for the authorities’ response. Directors agreed that the successful
completion of the political transition represents an opportunity for the authorities to press ahead
with efforts to strengthen the fiscal position, complete financial sector reforms, and accelerate
structural reforms to improve growth and employment prospects.
Directors considered the modest fiscal loosening to respond to weaker economic activity in 2015
to be appropriate, but stressed that a return to fiscal consolidation from 2016 onwards is needed.
In this regard, Directors urged the authorities to improve budget composition by containing the
growing wage bill through civil service reform and by reducing energy subsidies in a sustainable
manner through the implementation of a new automatic fuel price formula. They also noted the
importance of using fiscal space for priority social spending and stepping up the implementation
of public investment from its currently low level.
Directors stressed the importance of growth-friendly fiscal reforms. They welcomed the
government’s commitment to adopt a tax reform that increases equity, efficiency and permanent
revenues. Strengthening public financial management and public enterprise monitoring would
help reduce fiscal risks. Directors also commended the authorities’ commitment to pension
reform.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ prudent monetary stance. They were encouraged by the
recent move towards positive real interest rates and the central bank’s readiness to raise the
policy rate further if inflationary pressures materialize. Directors looked forward to further
efforts to strengthen the monetary policy framework and to the adoption of the central bank law

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers
used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

which will strengthen its independence and clarify its objectives. They supported the authorities’
commitment to move toward greater exchange rate flexibility—supported by efforts to deepen
the foreign exchange market—which will help strengthen reserve buffers and reduce imbalances.
Directors welcomed the steps being taken to modernize and strengthen the banking system and
its governance. They called for the swift completion of the recapitalization of all public banks
and stressed the importance of ensuring regulatory compliance throughout the restructuring
period. They also emphasized the importance of modernizing the banking resolution framework,
strengthening banking supervision and regulation, and introducing an effective bankruptcy law to
support the resolution of nonperforming loans.
Directors stressed that a better business environment is key to bolster growth and job creation
and strengthen competitiveness. They welcomed the adoption of the competition law, and called
on the authorities to step up efforts to revamp the regulatory environment—including through
adopting long-standing legislation on investment—and to initiate labor market reforms aimed at
addressing the high levels of unemployment.
It is expected that the next Article IV consultation with Tunisia will be held in accordance with
the Executive Board decision on consultation cycles for members with Fund arrangements.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION,
SIXTH REVIEW UNDER THE STAND-BY ARRANGEMENT,
AND REQUEST FOR REPHASING

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Context. Tunisia’s economy has been resilient throughout a protracted political transition and
a difficult international economic environment. The country is now facing headwinds from
increasing security threats and social tensions, which are offsetting the benefits from the
successful conclusion of the political transition, lower international oil prices, and a recovering
Europe. High unemployment, large external imbalances, weak budget composition, and
incomplete banking and business climate reforms remain the key challenges.
A challenging policy and reform agenda. A return to growth-supporting fiscal
consolidation, a prudent monetary policy, and a more flexible exchange rate need to be
pursued to contain high external and fiscal imbalances, and anchor inflationary
expectations. Moving toward stronger and more inclusive growth requires a stronger
push on structural reforms, which can no longer be postponed. Priorities include:
(i) improving financial sector intermediation by completing the restructuring of public
banks and strengthening banking regulations; (ii) improving budget composition
through wage bill containment, tax and energy subsidy reform, and increased public
investment; and (iii) generating a business climate more conducive to private sector
development and investment by revamping the regulatory framework.
Program implementation has been mixed. All quantitative performance criteria for
end-December 2014 and end-March 2015 have been met; one indicative target on
social spending was not met. Progress on structural reforms continues to be slow, with
three out of seventeen structural benchmarks expected to be met by end-September.
The next and final review will focus on the completion of the unfinished agenda in
banking and tax reform.
Risks continue to be high. Main risks relate to increasing regional and domestic
security tensions, and weaker economic activity in major trading partners. A difficult
social environment and opposition from vested interests could undermine support for
the reform efforts.
The completion of the sixth review makes SDR 214.875 million (about
$300 million) available.

CONTEXT: RESILIENCE IN A DIFFICULT POLITICAL
TRANSITION AND A DETERIORATING SECURITY
ENVIRONMENT
1.
Tunisia’s economy has been resilient during a prolonged political transition but has
been weakened by deteriorating security conditions. Over the past four years, Tunisia adopted a
new constitution and successfully completed its democratic transformation with free and fair
elections. During this process, the country experienced significant uncertainty, social unrest, and
attacks by armed militants (Box 1). Throughout, it has successfully preserved macroeconomic
stability in the face of a difficult international economic environment and increased regional turmoil.
The tragic terrorist attacks at the Bardo Museum and in Sousse in the first half of 2015—which killed
60 western tourists—represent a severe blow to an economy already facing large external and fiscal
imbalances.
2.
Economic policies have been broadly consistent with Fund advice. During 2012, fiscal
policy was loosened to deal with the immediate aftermath of the 2011 revolution, prior to turning to
medium-term fiscal consolidation. Spending composition, however, worsened as public investment
bore the brunt of the adjustment. The authorities have broadly followed recommendations of the
2012 Article IV staff report (Box 2) in the context of the two-year SBA approved in June 2013 and
extended to December 2015, and whose aim was to achieve macroeconomic stabilization, higher
and more inclusive growth and protect the most vulnerable. Progress on structural reforms—which
have benefitted from strong donor support—has been slow.
3.
The successful conclusion of Tunisia’s political transition and recent favorable external
developments, represent an opportunity to accelerate reforms. A broad-based coalition
government—sworn in on February 5 and supported by a strong majority in parliament—provides
the opportunity to push ahead on reform implementation, which will also benefit from increased
policy space provided by the decline in international oil prices and a recovering Europe—Tunisia’s
main trading partner. The government’s medium-term reform agenda will be laid out in its five-year
economic vision, which will be finalized later this year ahead of an international donor conference
planned in early 2016.
4.
Intensified security risks, social tensions, and coalition politics have complicated policy
implementation. Frustration at the lack of economic opportunities—through industrial unrest in
the mining sector, a spike in strikes during the first semester (now banned by the introduction of a
state of emergency in the aftermath of the Sousse attack), union pressures for higher wages—have
been testing the new government’s ability to undertake difficult reforms and reinforced investors’
wait-and-see attitude. The two major terror attacks that occurred earlier this year are severely
impacting the tourism industry and investor confidence, and may shift the government’s limited
resources to security issues and delay policy implementation.

Box 2. Tunisia: Authorities’ Response to Policy Recommendations in Previous
Article IV Consultations
Macroeconomic policies have remained broadly consistent with staff advice…

Fiscal policy preserved short-term stability but did not support growth. Staff noted that a
loosening of the fiscal stance in 2012 should be followed by “growth friendly” consolidation. The fiscal
consolidation that followed was driven by a worsening composition of the budget, with higher current
expenditures (primarily the wage bill) and a significant under-execution of the capital budget. The
authorities acknowledged the deteriorating spending composition but noted that the under-execution of
capital expenditures reflects capacity absorption difficulties in the aftermath of the revolution and was not
planned as an adjustment measure. They also noted the steps they took to reduce energy subsidies and
increase transfers to the most vulnerable.

Monetary policy was tightened. The authorities pointed to several measures taken to contain
inflationary pressures, including through higher policy rates. They also noted the progress made in
improving the institutional framework, including through strengthening collateral requirements and
establishing a monetary policy committee—a key recommendation of the previous Article IV. They noted
that weaker economic activity is maintaining liquidity tight, with banks remaining dependent on central bank
refinancing. To further improve the monetary framework, revising caps on lending rates is also a priority.



Greater exchange rate flexibility. The authorities confirmed that they are moving towards greater
exchange rate flexibility by reducing their interventions, and by moving toward introducing a weekly auction
mechanism albeit at a slower pace than initially envisaged. They noted that persistent sales of foreign
exchange are necessary to smooth excessive fluctuations in the exchange rate arising largely from lumpy
energy imports.
…and progress on the structural front has been mixed.


Reforms to modernize and strengthen the banking system are ongoing. The authorities noted
progress made in: (i) revamping regulations on loan classification, provisioning and liquidity; (ii) starting the
public banks’ restructuring process (including completion of audits and launching of the recapitalization
process); (iii) improving the design of bank reporting; and (iv) developing a bank rating system. They
acknowledged delays in banking reforms, but noted the acceleration of the reforms over the last six months,
which should lead by the end of the year to: the effective restructuring of public banks, the elimination of
regulatory forbearance, the strengthening of bank supervision, and the improvement of the legal framework,
which is not fully in line with good international practices (approval of the new Banking and CBT laws are
pending). The authorities attribute past delays to the late start of the international audit of public banks and
legislative priorities (e.g., Constitution).

Reforms to improve governance and the business environment. The authorities noted the
recent adoption of the competition law, and all the preparatory technical work done to finalize the
investment code and insolvency regime. The authorities view these reforms as priorities, and attribute the
previous delays to a necessary focus by the legislative body on the new constitution and other legislation
necessary for completing the political transition. A national employment strategy needs to be developed,
and pension reform is at a very early stage. The authorities indicated that a broad consensus with social
partners and the formation of a post-transition government will allow for the completion of the national
employment strategy and pension reform.

Foreign direct investments, mostly concentrated in

access—including the January 2015 issuance of a 10-year Eurobond ($1 billion at 5.875 percent),
which for the first time since 2007 was completed without a third country guarantee—have helped
keep Tunisia’s reserve levels above four months of imports, but below 100 percent of the Fund’s

Following a significant deterioration during 2010–12, the fiscal stance improved, but
at the expense of budget composition. The structural fiscal deficit—i.e., the deficit corrected for
cyclical fluctuations and excluding banking recapitalization costs—improved from 5.3 percent of
GDP in 2012 to 3.3 percent of GDP in 2014. This improvement came with strong revenue collection
and a higher wage bill—which increased by 37 percent over the past three years, reaching
12.7 percent of GDP in 2014—while public investment declined from 6.6 percent of GDP in 2012 to a
record low 4.2 percent of GDP in 2014. Public debt is on the rise, reaching 50 percent of GDP in 2014
(from 41 percent of GDP in 2010).
11.
The CBT maintained a prudent monetary policy stance, by gradually increasing its policy
rate to 4.75 percent in June 2014 (from 3.5 percent in 2012). However, low deposit mobilization—
caused by weak economic activity and deposit drawdown by cash-strapped mining companies
impacted by work stoppages—are keeping several Tunisian banks (mostly public) structurally

illiquid. As a result, banks have been increasingly dependent on direct CBT refinancing that
amounted to TD 5.6 billion by end-July, despite the February 2015 elimination of required reserves
on consumer loans. Dinar liquidity is further constrained by continued CBT interventions in the
foreign exchange market. Private sector credit picked up in 2014, but has recently slowed down to
7.3 percent at end-June 2015, in line with weaker economic activity.

The fragility of the banking system remains a concern. At end-March 2015, banking
sector capital adequacy ratios stood at 9.5 percent (3.5 percent for public banks and 12.7 percent for
private), below the regulatory requirement of 10 percent and with one public bank deemed
insolvent. The overall NPL ratio is high—reaching 15.8 percent of total loans in March 2015
(approximately 21 percent of total loans after including bank subsidiaries)—and three banks (of
which one public) are in violation of the liquidity ratio. At the same time, the provisioning rate
improved from 46 percent in December 2012 to 56.6 percent in March 2015 following the
implementation of new prudential regulations in 2013. Given the burden of NPLs on net banking
income, the profitability of the banking sector is low—particularly for public banks—but has
improved in 2014, mainly due to an increase in commission fees and the reduction in provisioning.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TUNISIA



Growth for 2015 has been revised down to 1 percent (from 3 percent under the program),
reflecting the weak performance in H1 2015, work stoppages in the phosphate sector, and the
strong impact of the terrorist attacks on an already beleaguered tourism sector that will likely
trickle down to the broader economy and further deteriorate economic confidence (Box 3). The
drag on economic activity will likely carry over to the first half of 2016, but relief measures and a
gradual recovery in tourism flows will help improve growth prospects in the medium term, with
Tunisia projected to reach its estimated potential of 4.7 percent by 2018 (Box 4). A moderate
credit recovery, better resource allocation as financial sector reforms bear fruit, increasing public
and private sector investment, and the reduction in input costs arising from declining oil prices
will all contribute to the growth recovery. The recent blow to the tourism industry will increase
unemployment rates in the coming months, but they will eventually decline as growth converges
toward potential.



Headline inflation would remain contained. Continued implementation of a prudent monetary
policy and low food and energy prices should reduce inflation to 4.4 percent by end 2015 and to
less than 4 percent over the medium term.



The current account deficit would narrow only marginally to 8.5 percent of GDP in 2015, as the
drop in tourism revenues (one-third of annual tourism receipts are typically generated during
the summer) and low oil and phosphate exports offset gains seen earlier in the year from lower
imports and exceptional exports of olive oil. A more significant improvement is expected over
the medium term, driven by a rebound in tourism and remittances, a pickup in manufacturing,
oil and phosphate exports, and reduced energy and food imports.



Reserve levels will remain above four months of import coverage in 2015, helped by higher
World Bank disbursements and renewed international market access. Over the medium term,
greater exchange rate flexibility is assumed in the baseline to correct for an overvalued
exchange rate, and gross reserves are expected to gradually improve and eventually cover
5.6 months of imports by 2020 (Annex I).

Box 3. Tourism Sector: Economic Impact of the Recent Terror Attacks
Tourism is important for jobs and foreign exchange earnings in Tunisia. With annual turnover of about
3 billion dinars, it accounts for about 7 percent of Tunisian GDP and 10 percent of exports of goods and services.
The sector directly employs people across the value chain of 230,000 hotel rooms and roughly 190 tour operators
and travel agents. It accounts for 15 percent of employment—including jobs in a range of ancillary and
supporting services, such as restaurants, taxis and associated retail and artisanal outlets. However, over the past
decade, the sector has been crippled by structural failures, reflecting an outdated business model (relying on sun,
sand, and sea), poor governance, and over-reliance on debt that was generously provided by state-owned banks
and connected lenders.
Since 2011, a weak external environment worsened existing structural weaknesses. The uncertainty linked
to the political transition and increased regional turmoil held back tourism flows, particularly from Europe; the
latter account today for 45 percent of arrivals (from 70 percent in 2010) and represent close to 90 percent of
room-nights. By 2014, tourism-linked foreign exchange inflows had started to recover from 2011 lows of
$1.6 billion to $2.1 billion in 2014—but these were 16 percent below pre-revolution levels. By the end of the
political transition in December 2014, tourist arrivals—with increasing numbers from the Maghreb and Eastern
Europe replacing more traditional clients from Western Europe— and room-nights remained 15 and 22 percent
below pre-revolution levels, respectively.

Against this background, the impact of terror attacks has been devastating. The Bardo and the Sousse
tragedies prompted a 45-50 percent cancellation of existing bookings to Tunisia, emptying hotels at the height of
the summer season. Tourist arrivals from Europe declined by 70 percent (y-o-y) in July alone. Tunisia’s National
Tourism Office estimates that about 85-90 percent of the over 800 registered hotels are already experiencing
financial difficulties or are in the process of shutting down. For the year as a whole, tourism inflows are expected
to decrease by 45 percent (to about $1.1 billion) and arrivals will decline to less than 5 million people (from 6
million people in 2014), despite Maghreb tourist arrivals expected to increase or remain constant. The
implications for the broader economy are significant:
Growth. The drop in tourism receipts and employment will also impact the transport and artisanal
industry—and is expected to reduce growth by an additional 0.6 percentage points (to about 1 percent).
Domestic agricultural output (e.g. fresh fruits or vegetables) is also expected to be impacted by falling demand
from hotels.




External. The current account deficit will widen by 2.5 percent of GDP, putting additional pressures on
the foreign exchange market.
Fiscal. The direct impact from lower turnover in tourism establishments is limited as the related tax
revenues are less than 0.1 percent of GDP. The general slowdown in economic activity will however translate into
much larger revenue losses, which will be amplified by the relief measures introduced.



Banks. Tourism sector loans represent less than 7 percent of the total loan portfolio, but NPLs are
25 percent of the banking sector and 40 percent of the tourism sector loan portfolio. The hotels’ financial
difficulties will likely feed into higher NPLs, thereby hitting banks earnings and liquidity (for comparison, in the
year following the 2002 Djerba attack, NPLs as a share of total loans rose by 3 percent). Also, vulnerabilities at
one large state-owned bank will increase in view of its large exposure to the tourism sector.

the core of the slump in growth in 2008–10. The TFP
decline was highest for agriculture and manufacturing, while government interference and connected
lending stifled the development of financial and hospitality services. During that period, Tunisia failed to
reallocate resources away from less productive sectors and into sectors with higher potential (i.e., highvalue-added manufacturing and services). Staff’s analysis shows instead that Tunisia moved toward lowvalue-added industries (e.g., textile, machinery assembly, mineral products).
Despite the contraction of GDP, there is no evidence of a reduction in potential growth following the
revolution. Convergence of production factors to their pre-revolution trends would support a gradual
recovery, with growth averaging about 3.3 percent per year until 2020 in a muddle-through no reform
scenario. However, this growth performance would not be sufficient to make a significant dent in
unemployment or raise living standards.

Structural reforms could significantly
improve Tunisia’s growth potential. Based on
cross-country regressions, policies to remove
the most binding constraints to growth—
increasing access to finance, improving the
business environment, and reducing
macroeconomic risks—would push Tunisia’s
growth potential up by about 1.5 percent, and
could raise average growth in 2015–20 to
4.3 percent (Staff’s baseline scenario).

Risks are high, and tilted to the downside (RAM). Economic confidence in Tunisia will
continue to hinge on improvements in the security situation, with terrorist threats and spillovers
from the crisis in Libya―including refugee inflows―representing a key challenge. Tunisia’s exposure
to Europe—70 percent of its trade—makes it vulnerable to a protracted period of slower global
growth and surges in global financial volatility. An upsurge in political instability—including through
the inability to build consensus in a coalition government representing distinct political perspectives
—or further social tensions could worsen the composition of the fiscal adjustment or delay
structural reforms, exacerbating existing vulnerabilities and lowering the growth potential. Domestic
risks to reforms—from vested interests—are also strong and will need to be mitigated by a strong
outreach and communications campaign by the government.
15.
The authorities broadly share staff’s views on the economic outlook and risks. They saw
upside potential for growth over the medium term as political stability is entrenched, security threats
are controlled, Europe recovers, and reforms are implemented to transform the economy and help
Tunisia move up the value chain. The authorities expect private demand to remain the main driver of
growth, as banks restart playing their financial intermediation role. They agreed that macroeconomic
and financial sustainability of Tunisia’s growth path will require less reliance on consumption and
imports. The authorities also agreed that risk mitigation measures will require a strong outreach
campaign and overcoming administrative and legislative capacity constraints.

High
Delays or reversals in structural reforms could lead to growth that is
insufficient to reduce high unemployment rates and improve living
standards for most. Heightened social tensions, renewed focus on
security and loss of confidence would undermine economic activity
and also affect the ability to take policy actions, negatively impacting
investment and growth. Authorities should (i) improve budget
composition by containing current spending, while increasing
growth-enhancing capital expenditures; (ii) complete banking sector
reforms; (iii) pass long-awaited economic legislation, including on
PPP, bankruptcy, investment code, and tax reform; and (iv) build
public confidence and ownership through continuous
communication.

Global financial and commodity price volatility could destabilize
global recovery and financial markets, adversely affecting partner
countries’ economies, slowing FDI inflows, and increasing financing
needs. Recommended policy responses include: (i) creating fiscal
space by containing the wage bill, reforming energy subsidies and the
tax system to make room for growth-enhancing priority spending;
(ii) countercyclical monetary policy (assuming inflationary pressures
are not present); and (iii) completion of banking reforms.

Medium

Medium

Structurally weak growth in key advanced and
emerging economies, driven by weak potential
growth in Europe, and incomplete structural reforms
and maturing of the cycle in emerging markets.
Medium
Increased geopolitical tensions in the Middle East,
driven by the intensification of ongoing conflicts,
heightened risks of fragmentation, and dislocation in
the region, leading to a sharp rise in oil prices with
negative global spillovers.

Growth would be adversely affected through trade, remittances, and
investment channels. Authorities should (i) diversify export markets;
(ii) pursue bolder and faster structural reforms to increase
productivity and competitiveness; and (iii) let automatic fiscal
stabilizers operate.
High
Growth may fall on account of shaken investor confidence, increased
security spending, sharp increases in oil prices, and tighter financing
conditions. Authorities should (i) rebuild fiscal and external buffers;
and (ii) accelerate economic and structural reforms.

*The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in the
view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a
probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability between 30 and 50 percent). The
RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually
exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.

THE REFORM AGENDA
Discussions focused on Tunisia’s need to accelerate growth, make it more inclusive, and
provide high-quality jobs. This requires maintaining macroeconomic stability—through high-quality
fiscal consolidation, prudent monetary policy, and greater exchange rate flexibility—in a context of
high security threats, social demands, and downside risks. This pre-requisite to growth should be
accompanied by the decisive and timely implementation of ambitious structural reforms to improve
budget composition, strengthen the financial system, and improve the business environment. All these
elements are essential to achieve higher and more inclusive growth and make a significant dent in
unemployment.

public sector wage bill (equivalent to

generalized salary increase. These higher expenditures were accompanied by a significant underexecution of capital spending (0.7 percent of GDP) and net savings from lower oil prices (1.6 percent
of GDP decline in energy subsidies), which helped limit the structural fiscal deficit to 3.5 percent of
GDP in 2015 (lower than programmed, but up from 3.3 percent of GDP in 2014). The authorities
noted that the 2015 deficit would have been lower than in 2014 in the absence of the record (and
unplanned) decline in public investment in 2014. They underlined their efforts at containing fiscal
imbalances as the revised budget includes a 20 percent across the board cut in non-essential goods
and services (MEFP ¶9).

wage bill in the medium term (Section B). Staff urged the quick implementation of the tax reform
package (see Section B), which would have helped compensate for the increasing wage bill through
new permanent revenue measures. The authorities argued that the 2015 revised budget’s main
focus was to update key aggregates in view of the weaker economic outlook and introduce
“emergency relief” measures in response to the Sousse attack. It stressed that a major tax policy
reform would require more discussions, which can only be held in the context of the 2016 budget.

Box 5. Tunisia: Public Sector Employment and Wages
Public sector employment has increased sharply in the aftermath of the January 2011 revolution.
Between 2010 and 2014, as a result of high unemployment and security needs, public sector employment
rose by 20 percent to 615,000 workers. Of that increase, 40 percent was for security and defense personnel.
The rest was mostly the regularization of contractual personnel—primarily in low skilled categories—that
were made permanent. Total public employment—which includes a 30 percent increase in public enterprise
workers over the last three years to about

180,000—is today at 795,000, corresponding to a

Pressures from labor unions to increase public sector wages stem from the perception that they lost
ground since the revolution. However, this perception is not reflected in the data. Cumulative inflation was
about 18 percent over 2012–14 whereas the average public sector salary increased by 14 percent and wages
in the private sector increased by 6-12 percent. Wages of medium and lower public sector categories rose
by 23 percent (the 6 percent increase in the minimum wage in 2013 had no impact on the public sector, as
salaries for lower categories of civil servants are almost double the minimum wage). In addition, wages in
the public sector are significantly higher than in the private sector, with public sector workers enjoying a
23 percent wage premium over private workers, especially for better-educated new labor market entrants.
Comprehensive civil service reform is urgent. The public sector salary system is a result of structural
weaknesses, and not a new phenomenon. Past reform attempts—dating as far back as 1989—called for
ending the proliferation of allowances, replacing the current index system with a base salary scale, raising
recruitment standards, and strengthening the connection between performance and promotion. The
functions and staffing levels of the public sector also need to be addressed. The success of any civil service
reform will require strong ownership by the government and key stakeholders.

authorities’ readiness to tighten monetary
policy, should inflationary pressures arise as a result of public wage increases or if depreciation
pressures materialize (MEFP ¶13).
20.
Banks’ continued dependence on CBT refinancing is a structural weakness that needs
to be addressed and carefully monitored. The banking sector has been facing structural liquidity
needs since the beginning of the revolution, with recent improvements negated by fresh deposit
withdrawals from mining companies and increased FX interventions. As a result, banks have
remained overly reliant on direct CBT refinancing. When completed, the ongoing recapitalization of
public banks—which have been the main recipient of CBT resources—will help reduce refinancing
needs and mitigate the structural liquidity deficit. The establishment of a full-fledged lender of last
resort mechanism (November 2015 SB) which is expected to be introduced in the forthcoming CBT
law will improve the resilience of the financial system and improve the conduct of monetary policy.
Liquidity management will also be helped by ongoing improvements in the collateral framework, as
the share of borrowings collateralized by government securities doubles from 20 percent in 2013 to
40 percent in 2014 (end-December 2014 SB). This will also minimize risks to the CBT’s balance sheet.
21.
Staff welcomed plans to improve the monetary policy framework. Improvements in
liquidity forecasts and deeper interbank markets—including through the establishment of a more
mature repo market and a yield curve—are needed to strengthen the monetary policy framework
and facilitate the medium-term move toward inflation targeting. Staff encouraged the authorities to
speed up adoption of the CBT law, which will help reinforce CBT credibility through new institutional
arrangements granting greater CBT independence and clarity of objectives—an important prerequisite to successful inflation targeting. Staff stressed the importance of moving ahead with
removing the existing “caps” on the lending rate, which hampers the monetary policy transmission
channel. The authorities noted that consultations on that front, including with banks, are ongoing.

firms’ competitiveness. To further rebuild buffers, staff urged the authorities to purchase FX during
periods of excess supply.

A deeper market would facilitate a more flexible foreign exchange rate policy. Staff
commends the authorities’ plans—approved by the CBT’s Board of Directors in May 2015—to
deepen the foreign exchange market and provide the necessary liquidity for economic operators
(MEFP ¶19), including through relaxing conditions governing exchange rate and interest rate
hedging instruments. Staff regrets the delay in implementing weekly foreign exchange auctions,
which is now scheduled for end-October 2015 (SB), but understands that reforms to deepen the
market will facilitate its implementation.
25.
Over the medium term, a gradual shift to full capital account convertibility is needed.
A comprehensive reform of foreign exchange regulations—including current rules constraining the
use of FX deposits or caps on foreign investment in bonds and stocks—could attract significant
foreign capital flows and increase growth potential. The authorities agreed that more progress in
entrenching macroeconomic stability and developing domestic financial institutions and upgrading
their prudential supervision is needed before moving toward capital account convertibility. They also
noted that the peculiarity of Tunisia’s economy also calls for an in-depth study of capital flows
linked to the off-shore sector.

B. Achieving Higher and More Inclusive Growth
26.
Tunisia’s old state-centered development model has shown its limits. Over the past two
decades, state intervention has distorted product markets and held back the emergence of a
dynamic private sector. The pre-revolution focus on an industrial policy based on selective
incentives led to wide regional disparities and a predominance of low value-added activities that
failed to create good jobs (Box 6). A broad home-grown reform agenda—focused on fiscal reforms,
the financial sector, and the business environment—is needed to kick start growth and make it more
inclusive (see Annexes IV and V for a discussion of inclusiveness issues and taxation fairness).

The key role of fiscal reforms
Fiscal consolidation needs to be accompanied by growth-enhancing structural fiscal reforms.
27.
Staff supports the authorities’ tax reform strategy aimed at promoting greater equity,
simplification, and revenue mobilization. Following two years of consensus building and technical
work that culminated in national tax consultations in November 2014, a new and ambitious tax
reform strategy has been prepared by the Ministry of Finance, with support from Fund TA. It
appropriately focuses on: (i) addressing the complexity of the indirect tax system by simplifying the
VAT from three to two rates (6 and 18 percent); reducing exemptions, limiting excises to a selected
list of products; rationalizing customs duties from seven to three levels (0, 20 and 36 percent, the
latter for agricultural products); (ii) improving fairness, including through broadening the tax base, a
gradual convergence of the on-shore and off-shore corporate tax rates, improving the progressivity
of personal taxation, and simplifying the taxation for small enterprises; and (iii) reducing earmarked
taxes. Tax reform—which will be implemented in 2016—is expected to help increase tax revenue by
1.5 percentage points of GDP over the medium term—with the magnitude of the increase, including
in the first year, depending on how aggressive the tax package is in broadening the tax base.
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TUNISIA

Box 6. Tunisia: Inclusiveness and Growth Constraints
The January 2011 revolution highlighted that growth benefits have not been evenly shared. Tunisia’s
old growth model—based on selective state intervention—led to unequal access to opportunities and job
creation largely limited to low value-added industries. Regional disparities were very large: (i) average
poverty rates remained 3 times as high in the interior of the country than in richer coastal “offshore” areas;
(ii) at 25 percent, unemployment rates in the interior regions were double those of coastal areas; and
(iii) only 13 percent of foreign firms were created in the interior regions.
A growth diagnostic approach applied to Tunisia highlights the following structural issues—mostly a
legacy of past policies—as the most binding:

Lack of finance. Access to credit has been cited by business entrepreneurs as the main obstacle to

poorly on corruption, property protection, and
judicial independence where it is below comparable peers. Regulatory barriers and anti-competitive
practices limit growth, particularly through requirements for ministerial approval, prohibition of investment
in certain sectors, and tolerance for abuse of market position. Wide-scale tax evasion, inefficient tax
administration, and growing informality are also cited as causes of unfair competition.

Taxation. Overall, taxation in Tunisia compares relatively well with similar countries, but relies on a
very narrow tax base, because of tax incentives for offshore firms, VAT exemptions, and unequal treatment
between wage and capital income. Corporate taxation and sales tax levels are in line with international
norms, but high payroll and social security contributions represent a high burden for domestic firms.

Labor market. The 2014-15 Global Competitiveness Survey ranks Tunisia poorly on labor market
efficiency, where it stands 129 out of 144 countries, driven by the low participation of women (134), rigid
wage determination (119), lack of labor-employer cooperation (118), and rigid firing and hiring practices
(97).
Interestingly, infrastructure was not seen as a binding constraint to growth. Tunisia’s geography is an
asset for growth, reflecting its direct access to the sea and its proximity to the European market. In spite of
regional disparities in basic infrastructure, Tunisia’s existing infrastructure appears to be an area of strength.
Work force availability was also found to be appropriate, with Tunisian firms ranking work force education as
only the 10th most problematic issue for doing business in 2014. Yet, improving the higher education
curricula could help reduce the existing skill mismatches.

22

28.
A successful tax reform requires an improved tax administration. The authorities
confirmed their commitment to a three-year tax administration modernization program—aimed at
establishing an integrated tax administration with improved systems and processes. They stressed
their preference for a gradual approach by first improving compliance in the small business sector
before expanding the process to large and medium-sized enterprises. The authorities argued that
the creation of a category of “new tax collectors”(end-July SB), which would have helped provide
collection powers solely to the tax agency, would take more time as they first want to proceed with
moving existing functions in the same location but under current management structures. Staff
urged the authorities to accelerate the process toward unifying tax administration functions, starting
with improving the processes at the large taxpayer unit (80 percent of tax collection).

Staff and the authorities agreed that lower oil prices provide an important



A proper automatic fuel price formula. Staff
urged the quick revision of the existing asymmetric automatic fuel price adjustment formula—
which is currently triggered only if there is a cumulative $6 a barrel increase within a quarter—
into an automatic symmetric formula that will smooth large fluctuations in international prices
and ensure full cost recovery and appropriate tax collection. The authorities agreed with this
approach, but argued that such a revision would take time and can only be implemented in
2016. A well-designed communications campaign would also be needed to explain the formula
and its use should global prices pick up again.



Adjustments in electricity tariffs. Staff regrets the suspension of programmed increases in
electricity tariffs, which are still heavily subsidized—20 percent below cost recovery even after
last year’s efforts to adjust tariffs for medium and low voltage industries and eliminate subsidies
for cement companies. Staff urged further increases in electricity tariffs towards cost-recovery
levels to continue reducing untargeted and regressive energy subsidies. The authorities argued
that gains in overall energy subsidies from lower international oil prices do not justify increasing
tariffs at this juncture.

30.
Containing the wage bill is essential to make space for priority spending. Staff is
encouraged by the authorities’ determination to implement a comprehensive civil service reform,
which will help reduce the wage bill to 11 percent of GDP over the medium term (MEFP ¶32). It
urged the authorities to move quickly in designing an overall and comprehensive civil service reform

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

strategy that will review the organizational structure, revise salary benefits and indemnities, and
strengthen career incentives.
31.
Public financial management reforms are needed to strengthen budget execution,
notably on investment projects (MEFP ¶10). Earlier steps to decentralize project execution and the
adoption of the procurement code last year have not yet succeeded in accelerating capital
spending, particularly in the first half of the year, where the budget execution rate was close to
30 percent. Better project selection and prioritization, closer coordination between central and
regional administration, and better resolution of land rights—including through the implementation
of newly issued decrees allowing expropriation when needed—are expected to contribute to
accelerating the implementation of investment projects. Staff welcomed progress made in finalizing
the new organic budget law—designed with TA assistance from the EU—which will be submitted to
parliament in November. This law, along with the progress made in performance budgeting (MEFP
¶38)—will improve budget preparation, introduce medium-term budgeting, increase transparency,
and streamline existing control procedures.
32.
Strengthening management and control of public enterprises is necessary to reduce
contingent liabilities and fiscal risks. The recent completion of a comprehensive assessment of
auditing and internal control mechanisms of public enterprises (SOE) will serve as a basis for
formulating a new public enterprise monitoring strategy (October 2015 SB), including through
regrouping the various control bodies. Monitoring would also be improved by new performance
contracts for the five largest SOEs (end-October 2015 SB), which should include indicators that cover
financial performance. Staff urged the authorities to conduct a full assessment of fiscal risks arising
from the operations of public enterprises, including from the issuance of new guarantees. The
authorities stressed that over the last three years the outstanding stock of government guarantees
has remained below 10 percent of GDP, and that a clear action plan to reduce fiscal risks will be
established following forthcoming Fund TA on the topic.

Addressing vulnerabilities of public banks is a key priority of the authorities’ reform
agenda. Tunisia’s three public banks (Box 7) have been hampered by weak lending practices and
governance issues. Exposure to a tourism sector that has been severely affected by the impact of the
January 2011 Revolution and, more recently, by the terrorist attacks that directly targeted the
sector—is an additional factor. Progress on reforming public banks is under way albeit with some
delay:


Recapitalization is underway consistent with international practices (MEFP ¶23). The legislative
authority to use the recapitalization funds allocated in the 2014 budget was granted by
parliament in August 2015. The restructuring plans of the three banks (two of which were
adopted in February and June) and the launch of the capital subscription process will allow one
public bank (BH) to meet the 10 percent minimum solvency ratio by end-September. The
recapitalization of the STB—14 percent of assets and currently insolvent— is expected to be
completed in October at the end of the capital subscription process. Depending on the
finalization of the audit results, which are still pending, the third public bank (BNA) might not
need additional capital thanks to explicit state guarantees for SOE loans and planned asset sales.
For all public banks, and in line with sound international practices, the government remains
committed to cover any unsubscribed capital at the closing of the books, effectively diluting
existing shareholders. Staff stressed that lower provisioning needs, justified in bank audits by the
existence of sovereign guarantees for loans to SOEs, require the explicit commitment to renew
those guarantees.



Business plans underpinning the recapitalization of public banks will need to be updated to
ensure regulatory compliance throughout the restructuring period (2015-19). Existing business
plans (adopted prior to the Sousse attack) have become unrealistic as a result of a significant
drop in tourism and weaker economic activity. Preliminary stress test findings point to a capital
shortfall arising within a year (of about TD 50 to 100 million) under staff’s baseline scenario (and
no recovery of the tourism loan portfolio). The authorities agreed that updated plans should be
approved by the Boards of the banks before the end of the year (MEFP ¶21). They fully expect
that capital shortfalls could be met by banks’ sales of non-strategic assets. Staff agreed this
could be an acceptable strategy provided that sales are on an arms-length basis and not to
banks’ subsidiaries.



Operational restructuring (MEFP ¶23). Staff welcomed the designation of new Board members
in all three public banks, and urged continued progress on this front through a change in
management (expected to be completed by October 2015) and the signing of performance
contracts that will ensure proper bank monitoring during the restructuring period. Staff urged a
monitoring on a consolidated basis but the authorities argued that their reporting system only
allows that for certain indicators (e.g., cost-to-income ratio). Close supervisory scrutiny of public
banks will also be needed throughout the restructuring period to ensure proper monitoring of
regulatory compliance, adherence to sound lending policies, and proper internal governance
and risk management.

Box 7. Tunisia: Why Focus on Public Banks?
The performance of the Tunisian banking system has long been hampered by the performance of the
main three state-owned banks. These banks are systemic—currently representing 37 percent of banking
assets and around 28 percent of banking sector deposits. The role of the State in these banks has
diminished over the past decade but remains important as the latter is the main shareholder in all three
state-owned banks: STB (51 percent); BH (57 percent), and BNA (65 percent). The performance of these
public banks has been weaker than for the rest of the industry, weakening credit allocation and governance
for the whole sector:

highlighted the weaknesses of the state-owned banks,

(13 percent) than for private banks (8 percent) and
insufficient loan recovery capacity. Weaker economic activity will weaken further loan quality—particularly
for the STB which is heavily exposed to the tourism sector (54 percent of its loan portfolio).

Profitability of public banks is also half of private banks, mainly because of the bearing cost of
NPLs but also related to a higher dependence of gross income on interest margins.

Refinancing. Growth in deposits of public banks has been limited forcing public banks to become
the largest users of the CBT refinancing facility (40 percent of total refinancing).
The state-owned banks also suffer from an unfavorable strategic positioning. They have for years
followed strategic directions—in agriculture, housing, or hotel— that were not sustainable over the long
term, particularly since these were often used for easy access to finance “connected parties”. As a result, their
business model has seen a steady erosion of their market share vis-à-vis private banks. According to World
Bank calculations, other things being equal, it was estimated that the loss of market share would have
continued at a rate of 1 to 1.5 percent per year in the absence of a public bank restructuring.

35.
Resolution of nonperforming loans is essential for bank restructuring. The creation of a
system-wide Asset Management Company (AMC) to deal with distressed debt was envisaged in the
revised 2014 budget—with an initial focus on tourism sector debt. Its effectiveness requires
parliamentary adoption of the AMC law, which is likely to be delayed. Staff recommends adoption of
the law as long as it remains in line with best international practices (such as with regards to loan
resolution superpowers, fair transfer pricing, and governance) and is not a vehicle for bailing out
defaulted borrowers. In the absence of a law meeting these prerequisites and helping address the
high NPL issue, staff and the authorities agree that priority should be given to improving the
management of NPLs by individual banks through swift adoption of the new bankruptcy law

26

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TUNISIA

strengthening creditor rights and an effective resolution framework. The passage of this law is
expected in October 2015.
36.
Well-designed measures to buttress viable tourist entities weakened by the fall in the
sector will limit further build-up of NPLs. In response to the Sousse attack, a package of
exceptional measures facilitated the rescheduling of new loans granted to active tourist
establishments (MEFP ¶25). While concurring with most of the relief measures, staff warned against
an indefinite moratorium on non-performing loans and advocated strict eligibility criteria. The
authorities agreed with staff that the prudential treatment of the relief measures should be strictly
time-bound, transparent and complemented with corrective action plans; otherwise they could
result in regulatory forbearance and ever-greening of loans with the risks to be further extended to
other sectors.

the buildup of risks. Since the Revolution,

authorities concurred on the need for more
risk-based supervision, which will be enhanced through the hiring of new bank supervisors (SB) and
strict adherence to the sequencing detailed in the medium-term strategic plan designed with Fund
TA (MEFP ¶29). Staff regretted delays in implementing the full bank reporting system designed last
year with Fund TA, and welcomed the authorities’ commitment to apply sanctions to banks violating
existing prudential norms.
38.
Efforts to strengthen the banking resolution framework are progressing. The draft new
banking law includes important improvements concerning deposit guarantees, bank governance,
consolidated supervision, licensing, and the stronger resolution framework. Staff and the authorities
agreed that additional changes concerning supervisory enforcement, early intervention, and
resolution are needed to make sure the law is consistent with good international practices. Staff
regretted delays in parliamentary approval of the law, and urged the authorities to accelerate the
preparation process, recognizing that the consultation period with the banking industry and the
stakeholders concerned by this legislation represent a risk for its timely adoption.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TUNISIA

39.
Reduced state intervention would help promote financial sector development in the
medium term. Government’s direct control of three main public banks and its minority participation
in nine small banks (about 10 percent of banking assets) may continue to create distortions in the
future if public banks continue financing loss-making state-owned enterprises, provide financing on
non-commercial terms, or extend credit based on connections. The authorities noted that the State
has a key role to play and that there are no plans to reduce state participation in the three
state-owned banks, although the search for technical partners to help with the restructuring process
of some banks is underway.
40.
Further efforts to develop capital markets are needed. The absence of functioning
secondary markets for bonds and low stock market capitalization (about 20 percent of GDP, and
listings dominated by banks) means that capital markets continue to play a small role in allocating
credit across economic sectors and maturities. Development of a yield curve—including through
reduced emphasis on long maturities and a regular debt issuance program independent of seasonal
cash fluctuations—the adoption of mark to market valuation, and the development of new
corporate governance standards would create incentives to trade. The authorities agreed that nonbank financial sector development is also a priority that needs to be addressed to boost private
sector development. An overall strategy in these areas will be developed over the next few
months—with help from World Bank TA.
41.
Access to finance could also be improved by strengthening microfinance institutions.
Major steps forward were taken in 2011 through the adoption of the new microfinance law and the
creation of a new supervisory authority. However, microfinance activities remain too low (loans of
microfinance institutions only represent 0.3 percent of total loans by banks), with authorities’ efforts
focused initially on reinforcing the capacities of the supervisory authority. An upgrade of the
regulatory and supervisory framework, removal of existing caps on lending rates, and appropriate
accounting norms would also help in this area.
Boosting competitiveness through structural reforms
42.
The absence of a business environment conducive to growth is among the top
constraints to growth and private sector development in Tunisia. Distortions in the regulatory
framework—through authorization requirements, investment restrictions, or fiscal advantages—
provided privileged access to connected firms and limited the entry of new firms (e.g., sectors in
which investment face restrictions account for over 50 percent of the Tunisian economy). To address
the challenges and the heavy cost of bureaucracy, the authorities have over the last three years
initiated a number of reforms, some of which are yet to be completed:


28

Reform of the investment code and existing regulations. Staff regretted the delay in
adopting the investment code (now expected in November 2015). It, however, welcomed the
latest version of the code—which has been revised for a third time in three years—as it proposes
to increase market access, simplify investment regulations, and rationalize complex incentives
that used to expose different sectors to regulatory arbitrage (¶37). Staff welcomed the current
proposals of moving all remaining tax incentives from the investment code to the tax code and

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TUNISIA

stressed the need to limit the number of “sectoral” decrees needed to implement the investment
code. Staff also welcomed the authorities’ continued determination to simplify administrative
procedures (¶38).


Reforming the competition and bankruptcy laws. Staff welcomed the passage of the new
competition law, which would help remove discretionary application of business regulations and
open up key product markets. The approval of the bankruptcy law—in parliament for the past
two years—would strengthen creditor rights, and, as a consequence ease banks’ reluctance to
lend. The authorities reiterated their commitment to implementing these laws, which will be a
cornerstone of Tunisia’s new and more inclusive growth model.



A PPP framework. Staff regretted delays in the final approval of the PPP law, currently in
parliament, as the framework would mobilize significant private resources for public
infrastructure investment. The authorities stressed the need for larger consultations to increase
reform ownership, and avoid misconceptions of “privatization” associated with PPPs

43.
Labor market reforms should be phased-in quickly. The structural unemployment
problem in Tunisia—which is also characterized by important skills mismatches between labor
demand and supply—requires changes in existing labor market rules and regulations that carefully
balance better protection to workers with more flexibility to firms. To date, action in this area
focused on scaling up training programs and SME support program. The tri-partite dialogue
(between government, business and labor unions) process on this issue—started in 2013 during the
political transition process—has yet to agree on a comprehensive National Employment Strategy
(NES), which would be framed into a five-year horizon (MEFP ¶42). Staff urged the authorities to
speed up completion of the NES through identification of specific measures to reform the labor
market (including through reviewing the rigid hiring-firing policies, worker protection system, and
public/private sector compensation).
44.
Greater data transparency should accompany efforts to create a more inclusive society
(MEFP ¶30 and 43). Staff urged the authorities to bring the existing AML/CFT regime in line with the
2012 FATF standards, notably with respect to implementing targeted financial sanctions. It also
welcomed efforts to strengthen the institutional framework for statistics, including the imminent
adoption of the Ethics Charter for Statistics. Fund TA will continue to support the authorities’ efforts
to strengthen the national accounts, fiscal and balance of payments statistics.

C. Protecting the Most Vulnerable
Strengthening and expanding social safety nets is necessary to ensure growth dividends reach
a larger portion of the population.
45.
The strengthening of existing social safety nets is progressing. The existing cash transfer
system for the poor (PNAFN) has been expanded to cover 235,000 families (twice the level of 2010
and close to 60 percent of the estimated poor) and to provide more cash (average transfer has
tripled to about 80 dollars per month). The evaluation study of the existing PNAFN program and

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

29

TUNISIA

subsidized health program has identified fewer inclusion errors (leakages to non-poor) than
previously estimated. Based on this finding, and the expansion of the unique social identification
number (currently available for 8.5 million Tunisians), staff called for the quick adoption of a welltargeted social safety net (improving on the existing PNAFN) that could be fully functional by the
end of the year.
46.
Reforming the public pension system is needed to ensure its financial viability (MEFP
¶45). The public sector retirement and social security Fund (CNRPS) has been running deficits, and
depleted its cash balances by 2011. Since then, budget transfers—about 0.4 percent of GDP in
2015—have been alleviating short-term cash needs to pay pensions. In view of its importance and
social consequences, discussions with all stakeholders on a comprehensive reform have started but
not yet concluded. In the meantime, the post-transition government has publicly announced a oneoff voluntary increase in the retirement age to help alleviate short-term pressures. In line with
existing actuarial studies, staff stressed that a sustainable long-term solution would also need to
include changes in contribution parameters and pension benefits.

PROGRAM ISSUES AND MODALITIES
47.
All quantitative performance criteria for end-December and end-March have been met
(LOI, ¶3), though the inadequate composition of public expenditures continues to be a concern:


Fiscal. The floor on the primary balance for end-December 2014 and end-March 2015 has been
met by a wide margin, mostly because of spending under-execution of the capital budget. The
indicative ceiling on current expenditure at end-December 2014 and end-March 2015 was met.
The indicative floor on social spending was missed because of lower-than-programmed
transfers to vulnerable households (reflecting issues in the delivery mechanism in remote
regions).



Reserves. The floor on NIRs at end-December 2014 and end-March 2015 has been met by
comfortable margins, mainly driven by the successful issuance of international bonds.



Monetary. The end-December 2014 and end-March 2015 PCs on NDA were met by
comfortable margins, mainly driven by lower credit to government.

48.
Progress on the structural reform agenda has been slow. Only three out of seventeen
structural benchmarks expected by end-June 2015 have been completed. Slow progress over the
past year reflected the need to build consensus on reforms, the establishment of a new government
and parliament, and need for further technical analysis. Actions to complete all of the remaining
benchmarks have been initiated—either through the drafting or submission of laws or through the
ongoing banking recapitalization process. The authorities still plan to complete the large unfinished
reform agenda underpinned by the program within the remaining program timeframe. This is
challenging and will require moving ahead and obtaining parliamentary approval in a number of
areas, including the investment code, the banking law, the lender-of-last-resort mechanism, banking

30

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TUNISIA

supervision, tax policy (and convergence), public enterprise reform, the Asset Management
Company, banks reporting and rating system, and weekly FX auctions.
49.
New conditionality continues to support program objectives. Staff is proposing new
QPCs for end-September to account for weaker economic activity. To better monitor budget
composition, the indicative ceiling on current primary expenditures was modified into a QPC.
Concluding the current review hinges on the completion of the following prior actions:
(i) recapitalization of at least one public bank (BH) and the completion of the first phase (reserved to
existing shareholders) of the capital subscription process for a second bank (STB); and (ii) the
renewal of state guarantees justifying lower recapitalization needs (Table 2).
50.
It is proposed that the purchases under the arrangement be rephased (Table 8, LOI¶4).
The authorities had requested a program extension in May 2015 to implement the policy measures
needed to deliver on forward-looking commitments. Accordingly, the final purchase under the
arrangement will be rephased and be contingent on completing the seventh and final review. The
parliamentary adoption of the 2016 budget in line with program understanding (which includes the
new tax reform that promotes equity and efficiency, and introduces permanent revenue measures
that compensate for the wage increase), the update of the business plans of all three public banks,
as well as their effective recapitalization, will be critical elements for the completion of that review.
51.
The program is fully financed. Financing assurances have been provided by multilateral
and bilateral partners for the remaining of the program period. Multilateral support remains strong,
with the World Bank doubling and frontloading its disbursement (to $500 million) and the AfDB
negotiating with the authorities to provide new budget support (about $200 million) this year.
Additional tapping of international markets with or without sovereign guarantees is also planned
during the last quarter of 2015.

Tunisia has the capacity to repay the Fund, but program risks remain significant.
Tunisia has strong records of payments to the Fund, and standard indicators of Fund exposure will
remain low (Table 10). However, these indicators do not take into account higher projected
amortization payments in 2017–19. Moreover, risks―notably political uncertainty and increasing
social or security tensions―could jeopardize program objectives and erode repayment capacity.
That said, program implementation risks are reduced by the government’s reiterated commitment
to the reform agenda which is supported by a broad spectrum of political parties and renewed
pledges of international support following the recent attacks. A prolonged period of low
international oil prices would help increase external buffers.

STAFF APPRAISAL
53.
Economic conditions remain difficult in view of security risks and social tensions.
Tunisia’s economy has been resilient in a context marked by a protracted political transition and a
difficult international economic environment. In 2015, the successful completion of the transition
and the improved global outlook—with lower oil prices and a recovery in Europe—were expected to
improve prospects for Tunisia. But, recent terror attacks have underscored the fragility of the
economy: growth is weak, external imbalances persist, the budget composition is worsening,
banking vulnerabilities are high, and job creation is low.
54.
The successful end of the political transition and favorable external developments
represent an opportunity to accelerate reforms. While some of these are likely to be difficult in
view of opposition by vested interests, they can no longer be postponed. Inaction on reforms would
risk putting Tunisia in a low growth path that will make it difficult to create jobs and meet the
aspirations of Tunisia’s population.
55.
Staff welcomes the authorities’ commitment to maintain an appropriate fiscal stance.
The modest fiscal loosening in 2015 appropriately responds to weaker economic activity. Going
forward, fiscal consolidation is needed to reduce external imbalances, restore private sector
confidence, and ensure debt sustainability.
56.
But fiscal adjustment needs to be accompanied by better budget composition. A
growing wage bill has occupied the fiscal space created by lower international oil prices. Supporting
growth would require creating fiscal space by containing the wage bill through civil service reform
and reducing energy subsidies in a sustainable manner by implementing a new automatic fuel price
formula. Resolving capacity absorption problems—including those linked to land rights—would help
accelerate the pace of capital investment, which has reached record lows.
57.
Tax reform is needed to underpin fiscal consolidation and improve equity. Staff
welcomes the authorities’ plans to adopt as part of the 2016 budget, a tax reform strategy that
includes permanent base broadening measures, which would help raise revenue and promote
greater efficiency, equity, and simplification. Efforts in improving tax administration, including by

32

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TUNISIA

unifying tax functions within a single administration, are necessary to complement tax policy
changes.
58.
Fiscal risks should be carefully monitored. Staff urges the authorities to accelerate the
design of a monitoring mechanism for public enterprises and the implementation of performance
contracts for the five largest public enterprises. It welcomes the authorities’ commitment to pension
reform, which is urgently needed to ensure financial viability of the system.
59.
Reserve buffers should be strengthened. Foreign exchange interventions should continue
to be limited to smoothing large exchange rate fluctuations. A move toward a weekly auction
system and deeper FX markets will help promote greater exchange rate flexibility and improve
banks’ liquidity. This is critical in view of the high external current account deficit and rising external
debt.
60.
Monetary policy should remain prudent. Staff welcomes the recent move toward positive
real interest rates and the authorities’ readiness to raise interest rates should inflationary pressures
increase. The monetary policy transmission mechanism would be greatly enhanced by removing the
cap on lending rates and establishing a lender of last resort mechanism.
61.
Banking sector reform needs to be completed. Staff welcomes the adoption of the
recapitalization law and the designation of new bank board members. It regrets delays in
recapitalizing public banks, which would have helped reduce financial stability risks. It stressed the
importance of updating the business plans underpinning the recapitalization of public banks to
ensure regulatory compliance throughout the restructuring period. Bank restructuring should be
also complemented by the appropriate resolution of non-performing loans, through a proper AMC
and a new bankruptcy law. Adoption of a proper resolution framework, strengthened banking
regulations and improved banking supervision are also essential to reduce the buildup of risks.
62.
The newly introduced measures to help the tourism sector should be carefully
monitored. The prudential treatment in banks of the relief measures should be strictly time-bound,
transparent and complemented with corrective action plans.
63.
A better business environment is urgently needed to bolster growth and job creation.
Staff welcomed the adoption of the competition law. Further tangible progress is needed to revamp
the existing regulatory environment. Adopting long-standing legislation on the investment code,
and public-private partnerships is critical for fostering private sector development and provide a
level-playing field for investors. A national employment strategy should be urgently designed and
implemented to address labor market inefficiencies that constrain youth and women
unemployment.
64.
Risks remain high. Spillovers from regional conflicts, security threats, lack of consensus
amongst a coalition government, and opposition by vested interests remain the most important
risks to reform implementation. A strong outreach campaign and greater involvement of all
stakeholders to design and implement key reforms would help mitigate these risks.

Annex I. Tunisia: External Sector Assessment1
This Annex provides an assessment of Tunisia’s external sector, including on exchange rates, reserve
adequacy, and international competitiveness. Results suggest that (i) the Tunisian dinar remains
overvalued by about 5-15 percent, (ii) reserves are expected to cover 4 months of imports, but
remain under the suggested adequacy range of the IMF’s new ARA metric, and (iii) Tunisia’s
international competitiveness is deteriorating relative to regional peers. These findings suggest a
need to enhance exchange rate flexibility and revitalize structural reforms to increase
competitiveness.

Exchange rate assessment
Tunisia’s CPI-based real exchange rate has been on a depreciating trend, which has
recently been reversed. Since 2005, the nominal and real effective exchange rates (weighed by
trade partners) have depreciated by 27 and 10 percent, respectively. More recently, the
strengthening US dollar vis-à-vis the euro, the main currency in Tunisia’s basket, has led to a
strong appreciation of the currency in real and

using projected 2020 data, the macro balance (MB) approach suggests an overvaluation of
about 7 percent based on a calculated current account norm that should be higher than the
underlying current account balance (CAB). Third, the external sustainability (ES) approach
indicates that a slight adjustment of about 5 percent for the dinar is necessary to stabilize

Assessment of reserve adequacy
Tunisia’s gross reserves seem adequate based on traditional reserve coverage assessments,
but still fall short of the IMF’s new Adequacy Reserve Assessment (ARA) metric. Reserve
coverage improved in 2015, boosted by the January issuance of a $1 billion Eurobond, and is
expected to increase further in view of expected disbursements from multilateral and bilateral
sources.


Reserves exceed common benchmarks in traditional reserve coverage indicators, namely the
coverage of: three months of imports, 100 percent of short-term debt, and 20 percent of
money supply (text chart). Although reserves in 2015 are expected to be above 4 months of
imports for the first time since 2010, they are still relatively low compared to most emerging
economies (text chart).

It is worth noting that the CGER MB and ES approaches find a more moderate overvaluation compared to the
EREER approach because by using 2020 data, they implicitly assume that the variables that explain CA and
exchange rate movements will be close to their medium-term equilibrium levels, whereas the ERRER approach
uses 2015 data.

The IMF composite ARA metric4 shows that gross reserves in 2015 would only cover about
75 percent of Tunisia’s “risk weighted liability stock”, whereas the suggested adequacy range is
between 100-150 percent. 5 Although the ARA metric this year is expected to be the highest
since 2011, it still falls short of being within the suggested adequacy range of 100150 percent last observed in 2009. In 2015, scenario analysis suggests that reserves could
cover (i) around 115 percent of short-term debt at remaining maturity, thus mitigating
rollover risks and strengthening investors’ appetite to Tunisian assets; and (ii) more than four
months of next year’s imports of goods and services, which could effectively alleviate
constraints on imports financing if export receipts remain subdued or drop suddenly. Risks of
significant capital flight remain limited due to existing capital controls.

Given Tunisia’s de facto exchange rate regime, a crawl-like arrangement, the “risk weighted liability stock” is
computed as follows: ARA Metric = (10% × Exports) + (10% × Broad Money) + (30% × Short-term Debt) + (20%
× Other Liabilities).

Assessment of international competitiveness
Across regions, Tunisia’s overall competitiveness is comparable to similar emerging
economies. A comparison of a number of structural areas—including labor, bureaucracy,
infrastructure, trade, and regulations—shows that although the overall competitiveness of the
Tunisian economy compares relatively well with other countries in the MENA region, it is still
relatively low compared to other emerging and advanced market economies.6

Over time, however, Tunisia’s rank in the
global competitiveness index (GCI)7 has been
declining. Looking at Tunisia’s performance over
time, we notice that although its ranking has
been historically higher than the MENA and
upper middle income averages, it has recently
dropped below comparator levels (text chart).
This deterioration calls for bolder and faster
structural reforms efforts in a number of areas;
most importantly in financial market
development, technological readiness, and
innovation.

The same pattern is also observed for trade-related measures of competitiveness. The
“trading across borders” database, part of the World Bank’s Doing Business Report, ranks Tunisia
slightly above the MENA average (text chart). Tunisia also fares relatively well relative to OECD
countries in terms of costs to exports and imports, although the number of documents and days
to export and import are lower in OECD countries. Overall, in a cross-sectional dimension, Tunisia
appears to fare relatively well in terms of trade competitiveness. However, evidence suggests that
Tunisia’s performance stagnated over time while others improved more rapidly, allowing them to
close the gap with frontier economies at a faster rate (text chart).

Bolder and faster structural reforms are therefore needed. The analysis above indicates that
slow progress in areas that determine Tunisia’s competiveness can have an adverse effect on the
medium-term external sector performance of the country. The recently observed appreciation of
the REER might also induce some competitiveness losses in the short-term. Therefore, bolder and
faster structural reforms that simplify the ease of doing business, encourage innovation and
technology, and upgrade logistics and customs procedures are urgently needed to boost
competitiveness and productivity.

Annex II. Tunisia: Public Debt Sustainability Analysis
Despite high fiscal deficits since the start of the revolution, Tunisia’s debt level remains sustainable
and lower than in regional peers. With the fiscal path agreed under the program (the “baseline”
scenario), public debt is expected to peak at 57.4 percent of GDP in 2018 before declining over the
medium term. Gross financing needs are expected to peak close to 9.2 percent of GDP in 2015 and
to moderate around 5.9 percent of GDP by 2019, reflecting relatively long maturities and favorable
conditions by official external creditors. Stress scenarios and the heat map confirm the
sustainability of debt dynamics, though substantial vulnerabilities arise from the large proportion of
foreign debt and the impact of a permanent slow growth and/or a depreciating currency.

Baseline and realism of projections1


Growth and prices. Past projections of growth show some forecast errors tilted to the
optimistic side, mainly driven by the large swing in 2011 GDP following the revolution; since
then, forecast errors have been in line with other countries. Near-term growth prospects have
been revised down following weaker economic activity and the terrorist attacks in the first
part of 2015 with a severe impact on the tourism sector. Past projections of inflation have
been generally in line with other countries, though inflation since 2011 has generally been
higher than initially projected. The current inflation forecast has remained unchanged
compared to the last review, thanks to moderating food prices and limited second-round
effects of administrated price increases.



Debt level and fiscal adjustment. Increased banking recapitalization costs and weakerthan-originally-expected growth dynamics will contribute to increasing the debt-to-GDP
ratio to 54 percent of GDP by 2015. The gradual but steady fiscal consolidation and a pick-up
in growth rates starting in 2016 would help control the debt-to-GDP ratio to a slightly lower
level by end-2020; this, however, would still be 7.1 percentage points of GDP higher than the
average of 2004–12. The pace of the envisaged fiscal consolidation (with a cash deficit
declining from 5.7 percent in 2015 to below 1.0 percent of GDP by 2020) is in line with other
countries.



Sovereign yields. Tunisia’s effective interest rate is projected to decline in the medium term
thanks to the large proportion of concessional or guaranteed debt, and the redemption of
the 2017 Eurobond. However, domestic yields might increase somewhat in the next three
years from the current moderate levels, before stabilizing in the medium term thanks to a
decline in risk premia, as reforms bear fruit.



Maturity and rollover. Tunisia enjoys relatively long maturities in both foreign and domestic
debt (with an average well above three years in the domestic market). Gross financing needs
will remain moderate, but a large current account deficit and significant private sector

external amortization will drive external financing needs up to 26 percent of GDP, exposing
vulnerabilities to increased uncertainties in external flows.

Stress test and heat map
Public debt dynamics remain vulnerable to adverse shocks and could deteriorate significantly
relative to the baseline, but would remain still sustainable.


Under most adverse scenarios, the public debt-to-GDP ratio would initially worsen and then
stabilize between 56 percent and 63 percent in 2020. Scenarios include: a failure to
implement medium-term fiscal consolidation; shocks to growth or to the real interest rate;
and the realization of a one-off 10 percent of GDP fiscal contingent liability.2



The most severe shocks point to higher but sustainable debt in the medium term. A one-time
40 percent depreciation would increase the public debt-to-GDP ratio to about 69 percent
before it declines to 63.4 percent by 2020, because about 68 percent of public debt is
denominated in foreign currency.



A combined shock (to real growth and the primary balance) would raise public debt to
82.2 percent of GDP by 2018 before declining to 78.6 percent by the end of the outlook while
a contingent liability shock will raise the public debt to 72.3 percent in 2018 before declining
to 67.6 percent in 2020.

Tunisia’s relatively high reliance on foreign debt is a weakness (see Heat Map), making it more
vulnerable to market perceptions and to volatile private sector flows. The emergence of
important contingent liabilities could also increase financing needs significantly and above the
high early warning threshold. On the upside, public debt is generally of long maturity and,
provided fiscal consolidation continues as envisaged, debt dynamics will remain favorable.

2
The one-off 10 percent of GDP shock to contingent liabilities reflects an additional 3 percent of GDP in
bank recapitalization costs and the realization of about 7 percent of GDP of government’s contingent
liabilities from public enterprises (these represent about 70 percent of government’s existing contingent
liabilities).

1/ Public sector is defined as central government.
2/ Based on available data.
3/ Long-term bond spread over U.S. bonds.
4/ Defined as interest payments divided by debt stock (excluding guarantees) at the end of previous year.
5/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;
a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
6/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
7/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as ae(1+r).
8/ Includes asset changes and interest revenues (if any). For projections, includes exchange rate changes during the projection period.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

Annex III. Tunisia: External Debt Sustainability Analysis
Tunisia’s external debt has been rising since 2011. External debt declined sharply in recent
years from over 65 percent of GDP in 2002 to 48 percent of GDP at end-2011. The authorities
have followed prudent borrowing policies, refraining, until recently, from accessing international
capital markets and opting instead for concessional resources from multilateral and development
banks. In the immediate period following the January 2011 revolution, the external debt to GDP
ratio climbed back to around 54 percent, reflecting an expansionary fiscal stance and widening
current account deficits. Most of the new borrowing originated from official creditors or through
market access backed by a third party guarantee, with the exception of a $1 billion Eurobond
issued in January 2015.
Under baseline projections,1 external debt would continue increasing, peaking in 2018
before declining gradually over the medium term. The external debt-to-GDP ratio is expected
to increase from 56.2 percent in 2014 to 64.4 percent in 2015, driven by the January 2015
issuance of a $1 billion Eurobond and external official financing in the second half of the year. It
would peak at 68.5 percent of GDP in 2018, before converging to around 64 percent by 2020,
following favorable current account dynamics (Table 1).
The external debt-to-GDP ratio is resilient to most types of adverse external shocks, with
the exception of a large exchange rate depreciation shock. Tunisia’s relatively low level of
external debt as well as its profile (low average interest rate and relatively long maturity) makes it
robust to most shocks, with the exception of a large real exchange rate depreciation shock.
Specifically, results suggest that the external debt-to-GDP ratio would remain below 74 percent
of GDP throughout the projection period under all but one shock scenario. For example, a
permanent negative shock to growth or to the current account would raise the debt ratio to
71–73 percent of GDP, while an increase in the average interest rate would have almost no
impact. However, a sharp real depreciation (one-time 30 percent) of the exchange rate relative to
the baseline would raise the external debt ratio to around 97 percent of GDP in 2016 before
declining to about 91 percent by 2020 (Figure 1).

Countries,” IMF Board Paper (Washington, D.C.: International Monetary Fund).

Annex IV. Tunisia’s Inclusiveness Issues1
Tunisia’s robust growth rates over the past decades have made significant progress in reducing
poverty and inequality. However, inclusiveness is constrained by insufficient job creation, and
significant economic and social regional disparities. A large informal sector also undermines
inclusiveness in Tunisia.
Strong GDP growth reduced poverty incidence in Tunisia over the past decades. Tunisia’s
4.4 percent growth rate over the 1980-2010 period helped halve the poverty rate—as measured
by the international poverty line of $2 a day—

However, Tunisia’s growth performance did not translate into equal opportunities for all.
Growth did not succeed in reducing unemployment, which was in double digits during the past
twenty years, and is averaging more than 15 percent in 2015 (after having increased to
19 percent in the immediate aftermath of the revolution). Economic opportunities also excluded:


Youth. The unemployment rate for persons aged 15-24 averaged 35 percent in 2015, double
the overall average. It is strikingly high among young graduates (67 percent in 2015). In
particular, large graduate unemployment also reflects the existence of a structural mismatch
in the labor market between the increasingly educated labor force and the demand for lowskilled labor given that the Tunisian economy remains concentrated in low value-added
productive activities, and facilitated the growth of the informal economy.



Women. The World Economic Forum gender gap index shows that gender inequality
remains an issue in Tunisia, despite

Tunisia, which can be explained by
high reservation wages, high costs
of outsourcing domestic work, lack of good job opportunities, and social preferences.



Regions. Economic activity in Tunisia remains mostly concentrated in the coastal areas,
leading to an unemployment rate in the center-west and south regions that is three times
the coastal one and a poverty rate in interior regions that is three times higher than in the
coast. Moreover, the illiteracy rate is more than double the 12.5 percent rate registered in
urban areas, six out of every ten households in interior regions have access to improved
water source as opposed to almost universal coverage for the Tunis area, and the Tunis area
has 6 times more bank branches per 100,000 adults than in the poorest and marginalized
regions. An excessive tax and regulatory burden in interior regions, tax incentives for the offshore sector mostly concentrated in the coastal areas, lack of infrastructure and labor rigidity
are among key factors explaining these regional disparities.

The large size of the informal economy undermines inclusiveness in Tunisia. Using a MIMIC1
model, the size of the Tunisian informal economy is estimated to reach about 30 percent as a
share of GDP (IMF, 2011). Informality is also confirmed by widespread self-employment, as
85 percent of firms do not have paid employees, and lack of social protection (35 percent of the
employed people do not have one, with lack of protection most prevalent in the agriculture and
construction sectors). Informal sector activities are also higher in the interior regions.

Annex V. Fair Taxation in Tunisia1
Taxation can play an important role in promoting fairness, as it helps define the relation between
the citizen and the state in terms of equal treatment, burden-sharing, and economic
opportunities.2 This annex looks at the tax system in Tunisia, and assesses the fairness of its
various taxes. It finds that indirect taxes are inefficient and biased toward the wealthy and that
direct taxes favor capital income and offshore enterprises. Both could be modernized to improve
efficiency and fairness, which is the aim of the tax reform that is being finalized by the Tunisian
authorities following extensive national tax consultations.
Revenue mobilization in Tunisia is relatively high. At 22.5 percent of GDP, it is double the
MENA average, and the highest in comparator countries (text table). Indirect taxes are the largest
source of revenue, with revenues from VAT, excises, and other taxes on goods and services
amounting to around 12 percent of GDP, about half of total revenue. The other large revenue
component mostly originates from income taxes—equally shared between personal and
corporate income—which are almost double the emerging market average (about 5.5 percent of
GDP). Despite the high level of revenue mobilization, the level of collection efficiency and
fairness of the tax system are low.

Indirect taxes—relatively inefficient and biased toward the rich
Indirect taxes in Tunisia are inefficient and unfair.
Tunisia’s VAT collection efficiency (C-efficiency) ratio—
which compares actual VAT yields to potential yields
from the benchmark of a perfectly administered VAT
levied at a uniform rate on all consumption—is twothirds of the emerging markets average of 60 percent.
This low performance is explained by high tax
expenditures and complex regulations:

12 percent (for tourism and recreation), and
6 percent (health). In addition, several stages of the economic value chain are exempted.
These tax expenditures—representing exemptions for wholesale agro-products, cultural
activities, restaurants, and hotels, among other sectors—amount close to 4 percent of GDP.



Low VAT turnover registration thresholds. Registration thresholds for Tunisia are low
($32,000) compared to regional and international standards, and are multiple, adding
another layer of complexity to the system, which is generating an accumulation of VAT
refunds due to enterprises.

Tax expenditures make the VAT even less progressive as they benefit the wealthy relatively
more. Staff analysis shows that VAT tax

The excise system is also neither efficient nor particularly targeted to goods and services
consumed by high income households. It is based on a complex regime with an extensive list
of items that—apart from tobacco, alcoholic beverages, and vehicles—have a low yield and put
an unnecessary burden on tax administration. In the case of tobacco and alcohol, excises are also
used to protect local production.

Direct taxes—penalize wages, exclude capital, and excessively favor the off-shore
sector
Personal income taxes (PIT) are mostly collected
through wage withholding. The PIT system in
Tunisia—representing more than twice the MENA
average—is a schedular3 system with a limited base.
Wage incomes (salaries and pensions) represent
around 80 percent of PIT collection, and are taxed
progressively at rates ranging from 0 to 35 percent.
However, the yield on personal income taxes—
which reflect high personal income taxes—would
have been higher if not for the:

encourages underreporting and facilitates tax avoidance; particularly since the tax
administration does not have adequate powers to verify income and accounts. As a result,
more than 90 percent of taxpayers that are taxed under this regime declare annual turnovers
lower than TD10,000 ($5,000) (Text Table), keeping the yield of this type of taxation to less
than 1 percent of income taxes. Inaccurate taxpayer registries also contribute to the
weakness of this system; for example, it took twenty years to update the number of
registered taxpayers even though the minimum wage had increased above the “non-taxable”
minimum threshold.

Other taxes—encourage tax avoidance, may overly favor the off-shore sector, and not
efficient enough to capture the wealthy
The efficiency of international trade taxes in Tunisia is low—representing just 4 percent of
revenues—and favor off-shore companies. With seven tariff rates, some at very high levels,
custom duties encourage smuggling and complicate customs administration. They also tend to
favor off-shore enterprises, which are exempted from paying import duties on all inputs and
equipment if they export more than 70 percent of their imported inputs. Streamlined customs
procedures in the offshore sector represented a significant cost-cutting in view of a complex and
inefficient tax administration and red tape. In addition, an inadequate valuation system and
discretionary application of the customs code encourages tax evasion through import valuation
underreporting (estimated by the World Bank at about $1.2 billion dollars between 2002 and
2009 alone).

Property taxes play a small role. At 0.3 percent
of GDP, they are below the regional average of
1 percent of GDP (1.5 percent of GDP in
Morocco). Increasing their yield will help increase
taxation on wealth, which is often held in real
estate. Main issues to solve are linked to the
erosion of the property tax base due to
incomplete cadastre, and outdated valuation
techniques despite a relatively well functioning
computerized property registry.

Note: In Egypt, there is no property tax.

Reform agenda—what to do?
The incoming revisions of the Tunisian system intend to remedy the above-mentioned
shortfalls in tax fairness. Key priorities are to: (i) reduce exemptions on VAT and eliminate
preferential treatment for customs duties; (ii) address the complexity of the indirect tax system by
simplifying VAT rates from three to two rates; limiting excises to a selected list of products while
improving its targeting for tobacco and beverages; and rationalizing customs duties from seven
to three levels (0, 20 and 36 percent); (iii) reform income taxation by taxing dividends, reducing
further the tax dichotomy between the on-shore and off-shore CIT rates; and (iv) improve the
progressivity of personal taxation by raising the threshold for exempted income and simplifying
the tax system for small enterprises. Revamping tax and customs administration—including
through strengthening the large taxpayer unit and introducing a risk-based compliance system—
would need to accompany the changes in tax policy.

Appendix I. Letter of Intent
Tunis, September 15, 2015

Madame Christine Lagarde
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20431
USA
Madame Managing Director:
1.
Tunisia has successfully completed its political transition toward democracy and is now
decisively turning a new page in its history. Following the results of historic elections at the end
of 2014, the first government of the post transition period, appointed in February 2015 with the
support of a vast majority in parliament, has quickly set its priorities. In addition to emphasizing
improved security and anti-terrorism efforts—which are necessary for economic and social
progress, especially following the deleterious impacts of the recent terrorist attacks on our
economy and our people—it had identified 100 economic priorities. These were set under the
paradigm of a new economic development model, which will be finalized within a medium-term
strategic vision ahead of the international investment conference scheduled for early 2016. This
vision, which seeks to reduce the vulnerabilities of the Tunisian economy and promote inclusive
growth, is fully consistent with the economic program and reforms supported by the IMF, to
which we are firmly committed.
2.
The approval of the extension of the Stand-By Arrangement by the IMF Executive Board
last May provides the flexibility needed to complete our reform program, which has been
delayed by important challenges. Indeed, our government faced the task of implementing its
economic program in the wake of a number of natural disasters (floods in the south of the
country), security crises (such as the tragic attacks of the “Bardo museum” and in Sousse), and
social tensions (through numerous strikes). However, we remain convinced that the
implementation of prudent macroeconomic policies and structural reforms should continue in
order to preserve macroeconomic stability and promote stronger and more inclusive growth.
3.
Performance under the IMF-supported program remains broadly satisfactory, given the
constraints associated with a difficult national, regional, and international climate. The
performance at end-March 2015 was in line with our forecasts, and we were able to make up
some of the delays in completing the reforms:


72

Performance criteria and indicative targets. The quantitative criteria at end-December 2014
and end-March 2015 for Net International Reserves (NIR), Net Domestic Assets (NDA), and
the central government primary balance (cash basis) have been met. We adhered to the

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TUNISIA

continuous zero ceiling on accumulation of external arrears and the continuous indicative
target on non-accumulation of domestic arrears. The ceiling on current expenditure at
end-December 2014 and end-March 2015 was met. However, the floor on social spending
was not, primarily because of administrative delays in executing transfers for vulnerable
families, which we intend to reduce during the remainder of the year.


Structural reforms. Three of the seventeen structural benchmarks to be implemented by endJune 2015 were met (Table 2). Namely, these are the adoption of the 2015 budget, the
reduction of risks related bank refinancing operations, and the appointment of new board
members of the state-owned banks. We also adopted banking restructuring plans, which will
result in the effective and adequate recapitalization of one state-owned bank by endSeptember and of a second one in October 2015. We are making every effort to ensure that
all the public banks meet the prudential regulatory norms by no later than end-2015. We also
intend to complete reforms in taxation and public enterprises, the investment code, the
banking law, the lender-of-last-resort mechanism, banking supervision, and weekly auctions
by the end of the year, in the context of the seventh and last review of the program.

4.
In view of the macroeconomic policies implemented to achieve the main objectives of
the program and the progress in the structural reform agenda (Tables 1 and 2), the government
requests the completion of the sixth review under the Stand-By Arrangement and the
disbursement of SDR 214.875 million. The government agrees to the proposed new performance
criteria for NIR, NDA, primary balance and on primary current expenditure at end-September
2015, as well as a new timetable of prior actions and structural benchmarks, as described in the
attached Memorandum on Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP, Tables 1 and 2), and Technical
Memorandum of Understanding (TMU). The government also requests a rephasing of
disbursements, with the final tranche of SDR 143.250 million to be made available on November
15, 2015, subject to completion of the seventh review, which will be based on end-September
2015 performance criteria.
5.
This Letter of Intent (LOI) is based on the previous LOI and MEFP dated December 3,
2014. The attached MEFP discusses the key components of the government’s program and the
proposed measures the Central Bank of Tunisia intends to implement during 2015. We are
determined to rigorously apply our program, mindful of the difficulties related to the national
and regional environment.
6.
We are convinced that the policies described in the attached MEFP are appropriate for
achieving the objectives of our economic program, which is designed to ensure short-term
macroeconomic stability while laying the foundations needed to support growth and protect
vulnerable groups. We will remain vigilant and we stand ready to take any additional measures
necessary to attain these objectives. We will consult with IMF staff on the adoption of such
measures and prior to any revision of the macroeconomic policies described in the MEFP, in
accordance with the IMF’s policies on such consultations. All information and data required for
program monitoring will be provided to IMF staff.

Attachment I: Memorandum on Economic and Financial
Policies
I. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK
1.
The rise in social and security tensions has taken a toll on the economy, which is
weaker than envisaged. The persistent strikes in the first six months of the year—including the
near-complete stoppage of phosphate production for two months—reinforced private investors’
wait-and-see attitude, while Tunisia’s access to the international market and its higher credit
rating since the successful political transition pointed to a better outlook. In addition, the tragic
Bardo and Sousse attacks adversely affected tourism flows and investor confidence, while the
drop in international oil prices and the incipient recovery in Europe would yield positive spillovers
for the Tunisian economy.
2.
After a moderate recovery in 2014, particularly at the end of the year, lackluster
growth is expected in 2015. The steady decline in the value-added of nonmanufacturing
industries and the growth slowdown of market services have contributed to the deceleration of
economic growth in Tunisia, which stood at 1.2 percent for the first semester of the year (year on
year), despite the exceptional performance of the agriculture and agro food sectors. The main
indicators of the tourism sector, which are clearly trending downward with flows that are
50 percent lower than in 2014, along with planned investments, would point to an annual growth
rate of about 1 percent for this year, provided social tensions decline. Short-term risks remain
significant, particularly if security and social tensions increase, or if the economic outlook for
Tunisia’s main trading partners is revised downward.
3.
Inflation remains contained despite the recent increase in core inflation. After a
5.7 percent year-on-year increase in the early months of the year, the headline inflation rate
settled at 4.2 percent in August 2015, due mainly to decelerating food prices. For the end of the
year, inflation is projected at 4.4 percent, helped by favorable base effects, the implementation of
a prudent monetary policy, the planned freezing of administered prices for this year, and a drop
in demand.
4.
The decline of world oil prices should result in a slightly lower current account
deficit, which had deteriorated in 2014. The growing energy deficit and the substantial
increase in imports of manufactured and food products raised the current account deficit to
8.8 percent of GDP in 2014 (as opposed to a program target of 7.9 percent). This year, the
decline in world oil prices and weak economic growth will result in a significant decline in
imports, but this will only partially reduce the current account deficit to an expected 8.5 percent
of GDP, in view of the significant reduction in tourism revenue (worsened by the Bardo and
Sousse terrorist attacks) and the decline in phosphate and oil production. This slight
improvement to the current account, together with the January 2015 international bond issuance
of $1 billion over 10 years—without a third country guarantee, for the first time since 2007—and

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

75

TUNISIA

with the disbursement of multilateral loans, would keep the level of gross reserves at more than
four months of imports, by end-2015, for the first time since 2010.

II. PROGRAM PERFORMANCE AND STRATEGY
5.
Despite the numerous exogenous shocks, we are determined to rigorously apply
our economic program in order to preserve macroeconomic stability in the short term and
lay the foundations for more sustainable and inclusive growth. The objectives of our
program remain unchanged and we focused on the following areas in this review:


Maintaining macroeconomic stability. The collection of tax revenues, control of the wage
bill and subsidies, and a prudent monetary policy, together with a more flexible exchange
policy, are key to preserving macroeconomic stability.



Laying the foundation for inclusive growth. Reduction of the banking sector
vulnerabilities, including through the restructuring of state-owned banks, improvement of
the budget composition—building upon the implementation of tax reform and a better
execution of public investment—and the implementation of our structural reform program
are necessary for the development of the private sector, which is the main engine of future
inclusive growth.



Protecting vulnerable people, by strengthening social protection systems and by
systematically evaluating the social impacts of the planned reforms.

A. Short-Term Objectives: Restoring Fiscal and External Buffers
Fiscal policy
6.
The solid performance of tax revenue and the under-execution of investment
spending significantly reduced the fiscal deficit in 2014. The criteria for the primary balance
at end-December 2014 and end-March 2015 were largely met, due mainly to increased collection
of revenue (in particular VAT and an exceptional income tax) and to the under-execution of
public investment spending. This spending continuously declined to a record level of 4.2 percent
of GDP in 2014, despite efforts to reduce the problems of project identification and absorption
capacity, particularly in the regions. The structural deficit—excluding cyclical effects and bank
recapitalization costs—stood at 3.3 percent of GDP in 2014, as opposed to the program target of
4.1 percent of GDP. The indicative ceiling on current primary expenditures at end-December
2014 and end-March 2015 was met, particularly because payments on social transfers and goods
and services fell short of the budgeted amount. However, these developments resulted in the
non-compliance of the floor on social spending; an under-execution due to administrative delays
we expect to make up later in the year.

76

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TUNISIA

7.
We are determined to continue a medium-term fiscal consolidation—with a high
emphasis on growth—that will preserve the fiscal sustainability objective, and reduce
external imbalances and financing needs. This fiscal policy will achieve a primary balance in
the medium term, thereby containing public debt at 53.4 percent of GDP by 2020 (after peaking
at 57.4 percent of GDP in 2018) and releasing the fiscal space necessary to increase social
spending and public investment that are both essential for growth (see Section B).
8.
The new supplementary budget Law for 2015 reflects the country’s new economic
outlook. This law—approved by parliament in August 2015—aims to support growth through
stimulus measures, while preserving the fiscal balance as initially planned in the budget law of
2015. It takes into account the expected decline in economic activity; the depreciation of the
exchange rate; the spillovers from world oil prices (savings of about 1.6 percent of GDP due to
the reduction in energy subsidies), the drop of revenues due to oil production fall (a loss of
0.7 percent of GDP), and a reduction in the gas royalty from the Italy-Algeria pipeline
(0.2 percent GDP).
9.
The revised budget also supports an economy facing external shocks through a
counter cyclical fiscal policy that remains in line with our debt strategy and financing
constraints. Hence, we plan an increase of the structural fiscal deficit by 0.2 percent of GDP,
which corresponds to a 3.5 percent of GDP structural fiscal deficit in 2015 (equivalent to an
overall fiscal deficit of 6 percent of GDP). This objective reflects the impact of the new economic
outlook (including savings from the drop in crude oil world prices), an update of the public
investment envelope, and the following measures:


Emergency measures to address the new challenges (net cost: 0.7 percent of GDP). They
are the following: additional security spending (0.2 percent of GDP, in addition to the
increase of 0.3 percent of GDP already planned in the 2015 budget law), new measures to
support the tourism sector (0.2 percent of GDP, including the payment of the social
contributions to CNSS and of unemployment “benefits”), and a stimulus program for SMEs
(0.3 percent of GDP). We will also speed up public investment execution to boost
employment and growth (See paragraph 10).



A revision of the wage bill (net cost of 0.8 percent of GDP). The projected wage bill level in
the 2015 budget could not be preserved due to major social demands for the regularization
of past wage agreements and the strengthening of civil servants’ purchasing power (general
increase of 5 percent), which had to be met to prevent further strikes from threatening
economic activity at a time marked by significant security challenges. However, mindful of
the need to contain the wage bill at a sustainable level, we reduced the projected increase in
wages to 0.8 percent of GDP (as opposed to 1 percent) by postponing the recruitments and
the implementation of specific wage increases, which had been agreed upon but not yet
implemented . These agreements will be reactivated as part of the general reform of the civil
service (see Section B).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

77

TUNISIA



Reduction of non-essential non-wage expenditures (savings of 0.1 percent of GDP),
through a 20 percent cut of available, but not yet authorized, credits in July 2015 to all
ministry departments (except those related to security).

10.
We are committed to speeding up the execution of investment projects which
remain under executed. The revised budget law shows a savings on capital expenditures of
0.5 percent of GDP compared to the budget law. This decrease only reflects an update of our
execution rate to 30 percent at end-June, not a willingness to use the budget line as an
“adjustment” post. Following the identification of the main constraints to the implementation of
580 investment projects, we are aiming at investment expenditures reaching 4.5 percent of GDP
in 2015 (compared to 4.2 percent of GDP in 2014) through the following: (i) redirecting non
initiated capital expenditures at end-July 2015 toward priority investment projects (such as
infrastructure) which could be executed under the revised budget law; (ii) strengthening
coordination between governorates and the central government; (iii) implementation of
application decrees, in particular for new public procurement procedures; (iv) reducing landrelated constraints through the recruitment of land experts and the revision of laws; and (v)
prioritizing projects which should be in line with the medium-term vision of the government. The
implementation of the information system on large investment projects will improve the
monitoring of their execution, which will be enhanced in the medium term through a national
body in charge of investment execution.
11.
We remain firmly committed to taking additional measures to correct any slippage
away from the program’s fiscal objective, including through reducing primary current
spending, a source of budget overruns in the past, which will be capped by the introduction of a
new performance criterion (see TMU). Investment and social spending (excluding subsidies) will
be preserved and will not be constrained by our fiscal consolidation strategy.
12.
The international bond issuance in January 2015 will contribute to meeting our
financial needs. We took advantage of the interest sparked by the success of Tunisia’s political
transition to gain access to the international market, with a bond issuance of $1 billion, with no
third country guarantee for the first time since 2007, and at a very favorable rate with respect to
sovereign risk. The external financing identified for the rest of the year includes mainly
multilateral budget loans (totaling $1.5 billion), of which $216 million from the European Union.
We also worked on mobilizing additional bilateral budget support, including planned debt
conversion (Italy, France), budget support from Algeria ($150 million), and project financing. In
addition, we plan an additional bond issuance through sukuks or with the U.S. guarantee.

Monetary policy
13.
The monetary aggregates were largely in line with program objectives, but with
increased pressure on bank liquidity. We met the criteria for net domestic assets at endMarch 2015 and far exceeded the program objective, as a result of a significant increase in the
net position of the government. However, the increase of CBT interventions in the foreign
exchange market following the Bardo events and net issuance of treasury securities—as well as

78

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TUNISIA

the persistent weakness of certain banks—resulted in a net increase in the overall volume of
refinancing, which rose to about 5.5 billion dinars at end-June 2015 (as opposed to 3.4 billion in
February 2015). Notwithstanding this, the change in the money supply was lower than expected,
because of the decline in deposits during the first semester of 2015 (due mainly to cash
withdrawals from firms in the phosphate and petroleum sectors following a drop in production).
A slight dip in credit to the private sector (7.3 percent year-on-year at end-June 2015, as
opposed to 8.7 percent in March 2015) reflects the slowdown in economic activity.
14.
The goal of monetary policy is still to control inflation. As a result of CBT
intervention, the increasingly tight liquidity did not result in pressure on the interbank rate (which
remained close to the policy rate – raised to 4.75 percent in June 2014). In light of the lackluster
growth of the Tunisian economy and the limited increase of credit to the economy, the last CBT
Board of Directors decided to maintain the rate at its current level. However, we stand ready to
increase it to prevent any resurgence of inflationary pressures, particularly in the event of a
steady increase in the pace of core inflation as a result of wage increases or the depreciation of
the dinar. A better communication strategy will provide an anchor for inflationary expectations,
including by maintaining a positive real interest rate.
15.
The reform of the monetary policy framework continues. We increased the minimum
proportion of government securities used as collateral for CBT refinancing from 20 percent to
40 percent (structural benchmark at end-December 2014) in order to reduce the risk incurred by
the CBT in these refinancing operations. We intend to enhance our current framework of haircuts
on debt eligible for CBT refinancing (introduced in July 2014) by using rating instruments, with
IMF technical assistance. Since May 2015, we have also committed to a second twinning project
(with the Bank of France as the main partner), aimed at modernizing the operational framework
for monetary policy, in particular by improving the quality of liquidity forecasts, deepening the
interbank market (including the introduction of a more mature repo and auction system that
would give rise to a yield curve in the short run), and revamping the regulatory framework
governing the market for private negotiable securities, while revising the conditions for
collaterals.
16.
We intend to strengthen the transmission channels of monetary policy and access
to financing by changing the system of excessive bank lending rates (indexed to the TEG).
The increase of the money market rate (TMM) over the previous year pushed up the TEG, thus
easing the credit constraints related to the TEG in the short run. A CBT inspection mission was
launched in July 2015 to prepare a review, if necessary, of the regulations on this matter, which
could eventually result in the removal of the cap on the lending rate to enterprises (and a
gradual increase of consumer cap lending rates). This review—which will also take into account
the World Bank’s recommendations—will improve competition among banks and the
transmission channels of monetary policy as well as access to credit for small and medium
enterprises.

17.
The finalization of the Central Bank draft law is under way. We submitted the draft
law on amending the statutes of the Central Bank to the Board of Directors in June 2015. This
draft, prepared with technical assistance from the IMF, seeks to provide the CBT with greater
autonomy (on institutional, functional, personnel, and financial matters), and to better define its
mandate (by adding the goal of contributing to financial stability to its primary objective of
ensuring price stability), while improving its governance, transparency, and accountability. This
draft law will be approved by the government and presented to the parliament in October 2015
for its adoption.

Foreign exchange policy
18.
Exchange rate flexibility is necessary to reduce external imbalances, build up our
foreign exchange reserves, and reduce the overvaluation of the dinar. To that end, we
continued to limit our interventions to smoothing excessive fluctuations in the exchange rate.
Nonetheless, the amount of interventions doubled in March-April 2015—compared with a
monthly average of $200 million since last October—to alleviate the pressure on the foreign
exchange market after the Bardo attack and, in particular, following the decision by a number of
foreign banks to close their foreign-exchange positions. These interventions—as well as the low
exchange rate against the euro-dollar—led to an appreciation of the real exchange rate, which
remains overvalued by 5-15 percent. In order to increase our foreign exchange reserves, we are
committed to restricting our monthly foreign-exchange sales to no more than $200 million net
and less than 20 percent of the total transactions of the market and to strictly limit our
interventions to smoothing excessive fluctuations in the exchange rate. We also intend to
intervene by purchasing foreign exchange on the markets whenever the opportunity arises.
19.
We are continuing reforms to establish a more flexible foreign exchange policy and
a deeper foreign exchange market. Thus, the CBT Board of Directors adopted a series of
measures in May 2015 including: (i) strengthening the CBT’s intervention tools, by introducing
foreign exchange auctions to increase the exchange market role in setting the value of the dinar;
(ii) removing the requirement for banks to back interbank foreign exchange transactions with
commercial and financial operations from firms; and (iii) relaxing the conditions governing
exchange rate and interest rate hedging instruments (forward contracts, swaps, foreign exchange
options). All these reforms introduced in the summer of 2015 are part of the improvement to the
overall framework of the foreign exchange market, which will facilitate the effective
implementation of weekly foreign exchange auctions in October 2015 (structural benchmark),
thus contributing to the smooth operation and development of the foreign exchange market.
20.
Our development strategy will continue to be open and based on free foreign
trade. In accordance with the rules of the World Trade Organization, we will only introduce
import restrictions and surtaxes as a last resort—and after exhausting all market solutions that
preserve the proper incentives—and only with very clear and preannounced withdrawal criteria.

B. Laying the Foundations for Inclusive Growth
Financial sector policies
21.
The financial situation of the banking system remains fragile. At end-March 2015,
the overall solvency ratio was 9.5 percent, below the regulatory 10 percent, with a ratio of
12.7 percent for private banks, of which one (the BFT) falls below the regulatory threshold, and
3.5 percent for state-owned banks. Asset quality remains weak, with the share of nonperforming
loans deteriorating slightly from 15.7 percent in December 2014 to 15.8 percent of total loans at
end-March 2015 (about 21 percent after including loans transferred to asset recovery agencies
affiliated with banks). The average provisioning rate for nonperforming loans improved from
45.7 percent to 56.6 percent between December 2012 and March 2015. Furthermore, three banks
(including one state-owned bank) still fail to comply with the new liquidity standards. The relative
control of operating expenses and, in particular, the reduction by half in provisioning efforts
compared with FY 2013, which had been marked by exceptional events (new regulations, audits),
and an increase of commissions fees, enabled all the banks to generate profits, growing quickly
at the global level.
22.
Reforming the banking system is an absolute priority. Progress in this area
encompasses the following three areas: (i) the recapitalization and operational restructuring of
state-owned banks; (ii) the overhaul of the legislative framework with a view to introducing a
bank resolution framework and a lender-of-last-resort mechanism; and (iii) strengthening
banking supervision. The legislative debate for some of these reforms started in August 2015.
23.
The restructuring of the banking system continues to be our priority. Between
February and June 2015, the general shareholders’ meetings of two state-owned banks (STB and
BH) adopted recapitalization and restructuring plans in accordance with international good
practices—including the principle of one-time recapitalization in an amount that would meet all
the prudential rules on an individual basis as of closing accounts of March 31, 2015, fully taking
into account the results of the independent audits conducted in 2013 and 2014. The
implementation of the recapitalization plan is ongoing, as the capital subscription process has
been initiated following the August 2015 parliamentary approval of the law authorizing the use
of the allocated public funds for bank recapitalization. Our action plan is based on the following
timetable and priorities:


Recapitalization of the three state-owned banks thanks to the closing of the capital
increase subscriptions (STB, BH) or after asset sale (BNA), which could amount up to 1 billion
dinars (1 percent of GDP) for the three state-owned banks. According to international good
practices, these operations will involve the dilution of existing private shareholders, who do
not subscribe to the new capital increase (dilution of 84 percent taking into account issuance
premium amounts and preferential subscription rights) or the allocation of losses to the
reserves before any injection of public funds. The state is committed to providing the
amounts to complete the recapitalization if private shareholders do not subscribe. According
to the projected timetable, the effective recapitalization of the BH and the first phase of the

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

81

TUNISIA

capital subscription of the STB will be completed in September 2015 (prior actions, see
Table 2). The effective recapitalization of the STB and BNA will only be completed in October
2015. In conjunction with this recapitalization, the following measures will be taken:
 The government will renew, in 2015, and issue guarantees on BH’s and STB’s loans to
public borrowers, which needed to be provisioned according to the audit conclusions
(prior action, Table 2). The guarantees would be provided up to the amount which would
enable the banks to meet prudential standards, and in line with the loan outstanding
amount. This will also be provided to the BNA as soon as the restructuring plan is
finalized. The government is committed to renewing these guarantees throughout the
restructuring period.
 To ensure that the recapitalization amounts can alleviate the impact of slower economic
activity than expected when the original business plans were made, the banks are
planning to build up an additional capital buffer by selling their non-strategic assets, a
sale that will be initiated by the end of this year. To account for the weaker economic
environment than expected, and to ensure prudential norms are respected throughout
the operational restructuring period, all three public banks’ business plans will be
updated and adopted by their boards by November 2015. Also, the 2015 revised budget
law has granted greater authority for boards of public banks to forgive tourism-related
debt, thereby allowing public banks to manage their nonperforming loans in a more
dynamic manner, and to increase the possibility of restoring the solvency of some debts.


Strengthening governance and the operational restructuring of state-owned banks. The
revamping of the banks’ governance framework, already initiated with the appointment of
new board members representing the government (structural benchmark at June 2015) and
the separation of the functions of the Chair of the Board of Directors from those of the
Managing Director, is a prerequisite for any decisions on operational restructuring. Starting
in June 2015, and in line with international practices, we also intend to define the roles of the
Board of Directors, its affiliated committees, and executive management, and to appoint new
heads to key areas, in particular risk, finance, compliance, and auditing. Also, tenders will be
issued, in the course of the last quarter of 2015, for the selection of an investment bank to
lead the process of acquiring a technical/strategic partner to invest in the banks’ capital,
which will be a step toward better governance and would provide the necessary expertise to
improve risk management and assessment methods.



Constant bank monitoring. In light of the risks inherent in the implementation of
restructuring plans, we plan to subject the state-owned banks under restructuring to
enhanced supervision by the DGSB, in order to monitor, on an ongoing basis, the
implementation of their plans, the conditions under which their accounts are again balanced,
and their degree of compliance with prudential requirements. At the same time, we will be
signing performance contracts (structural benchmark at end-November 2015) targeting the
convergence of the performance indicators for state-owned banks toward those of the

82

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TUNISIA

private sector by 2016, and on a consolidated basis for certain indicators (for example, costto-income ratio).
24.
The recapitalization of state-owned banks is part of a broader reform of the
banking sector, which must address nonperforming loans. Our strategy in this area is
twofold. The priority is still to continue and accelerate work on the review of the bankruptcy law
(Law 95-34) to make it more balanced with respect to creditors. Progress is ongoing: a draft law
was submitted to the National Constituent Assembly in October 2014, and is now a priority of
the new parliament and expected to be adopted by October 2015. However, alternatives are still
being explored, particularly with regard to the Asset Management Company (AMC), established
under the Supplementary Budget law of 2014. Its effective establishment and operational startup
will only be completed when the law on the AMC is adopted by parliament (structural benchmark
at November 2015)—in line with sound international practices concerning the AMC governance
rules, superpowers, loan transfer price setting, and sound financing plans.
25.
In addition to those structural measures, we took others—which will be subject to
special prudential monitoring—to support the tourism sector following the Sousse attack.
We decided to support hotel units—with no overdue loan repayments as December 31, 2014—
who risk financial difficulties following the drop in tourism revenues in the aftermath of the
attacks. These entail the possibility of: (i) a guarantee from SOTUGAR for any exceptional loan
from a domestic bank that finances hotels’ operations for 2015 and 2016, and (ii) postponing for
two years the payments on outstanding loans due by hotel units in 2015 and 2016. These
measures are not compulsory for banks which could decide, or not, to request the guarantee or
to postpone repayments. The banks that provide the exceptional loans will be eligible for Central
Bank refinancing and could freeze the classification of those loans through 2016, thereby
avoiding two years of provisioning costs. To enhance market transparency and monitoring, banks
will specify in their published documents, both the share of loans subject to the freeze in
classification as well as the prudential ratios in the absence of such measures. In addition, a plan
will be set up to ensure that prudential rules are enforced at end-2016 once those measures
expire.
26.
Compliance with prudential norms is crucial. To that end, after the recapitalization of
the state-owned banks BH (September 2015), and STB and BNA (both in October 2015), and the
regularization of the situation of one private bank, all the banks will be compliant with the
solvency ratio. The only exception is the BFT, which is in litigation. Hence, any bank, apart from
BFT, failing to comply with the prudential rules shall be required to regularize its situation as
soon as possible and shall be subject to appropriate sanctions.
27.
In addition to restructuring state-owned banks and consolidating nonperforming
loan portfolios, we intend to establish an appropriate banking resolution framework. A
draft banking law, including specific provisions for bank resolution and for the deposit guarantee
fund, was submitted in May 2015 to broad consultation with the Ministry of Justice, the banking
industry, and the accountants association. This draft law will be discussed within the Council of
Ministers, with a view of having it approved by parliament in October 2015 (structural
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

83

TUNISIA

benchmark). The law shall be aligned with sound international practices, in particular with regard
to the institutional framework, the clarity of criteria for starting the resolution process, and the
extent of the powers granted to the Resolution Committee, including the possibility of a bail-in
of subordinated debts and those unsecured ones granted to legal entities.
28.
We are finalizing our work on the lender of last resort mechanism, which should be
completed with the adoption of the Central Bank law. The broad guidelines of this
mechanism are reiterated in the draft law reforming the statutes of the Central Bank, which will
be submitted to parliament in October 2015. These guidelines are consistent with international
good practices, in particular with regards to the scope of the institutions eligible for last resort
loans and their eligibility requirements. In addition to these broad guidelines, which fall under
the law, we must complete our deliberations in order to clarify and document the operational
procedures for their implementation by November 2015 (structural benchmark).
29.
Reforming banking supervision remains an absolute priority. To that end, we
adopted a three-year plan in June 2014 (including prerequisites)—prepared with technical
assistance from the IMF—which seeks to promote risk-based banking supervision, assessed on
an individual and a consolidated basis. We are determined to implement this plan, which was just
updated in June 2015 by the CBT through 2020, and which represents our roadmap. Our
priorities are as follows: (i) increase human resources at the DGSB, particularly for on-site
supervision, by recruiting 20 new supervisors by November 2015 (structural benchmark at endNovember 2014); (ii) implementation of the new reporting system for accounting, financial, and
institutional data (structural benchmark at end-December 2014), the design of which was
completed in early 2015 but the implementation of which will be postponed until end-November
2015, with the publication of the circular setting the new reporting procedures; (iii) effective use
of the system for rating the risk profile of institutions and related indicators dashboard; and
(iv) publication of a circular on liquidity risk management to complement the recent introduction
of the new liquidity ratio.
30.
We continue our efforts to improve our mechanism against anti-money laundering
and the financing of terrorism. In addition to the annual questionnaires sent out to institutions,
the reference guide on risk management circulated at the beginning of 2015 now includes
additional information on these areas. A specific methodological guide was also prepared for onsite inspections. Several institutions’ frameworks on anti-money laundering issues were assessed
in 2014. We have scheduled a cross cutting survey on these issues in 2015. The banking draft law
includes a number of provisions to strengthen the authority of the CBT in this area by
establishing internal control and governance norms, giving it the normative power and sanctions
power for noncompliance with the applicable legal and regulatory provisions.

Fiscal reform
31.
Our medium-term fiscal consolidation strategy is accompanied by the
implementation of fiscal reforms aimed at supporting more inclusive growth. These steps
target civil service reform, tax policy, and tax administration modernization, and improvements to

84

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TUNISIA

the governance of public enterprises, public expenditure management, and public investment
effectiveness.
32.
We are convinced that a comprehensive civil service reform is necessary to
modernize public administration and contain the growth of the wage bill on a sustainable
basis. To that end, the government will establish a strategy for reforming the civil service, which
will be discussed and agreed upon in the context of the National Council on Social Dialogue. This
reform will be based on organizational audits, a study on the redeployment of staff among the
ministries and to regions, a review of the structure of wages and “other compensations”, and
career mobility. This reform will also help to reduce the burden of the wage bill in the long term
to about 11 percent of GDP (less than 35 percent of total expenditures), which will help create
the fiscal space necessary for priority spending and to maintain debt sustainability.
33.
An ambitious tax policy reform is being finalized. This reform—which was designed
after the national conference in November 2014—introduced significant changes to simplify the
existing system while improving revenue mobilization, equity, and transparency of the tax
regime. These measures include a reduction in the number of customs tariffs (from 7 to 3),
harmonization of VAT rates (from 3 to 2), a reduction in exemptions, and a lower and more
progressive income tax rate following modifications in rebates and deductions. This strategy will
be approved by the Council of Ministers in October 2015 (structural benchmark) and will be
published so that economic stakeholders can be informed of the government’s strategy; it will be
effective in 2016. The streamlining of onshore and offshore regimes, including the gradual
convergence toward a single corporate tax rate with a neutral impact on revenue, is part of the
framework of this reform and will be announced with a clear timetable by end-October
(structural benchmark).
34.
The modernization of the tax administration is critical to the planned simplification
of taxes. Our modernization plan, adopted in August 2014 and updated in May 2015, seeks to
implement a unified tax administration and to strengthen control and assessment mechanisms.
The first phase of implementation of this reform involves the creation of a collection unit within
the Large Taxpayer Unit, which will substitute for the initial project aimed at creating a new
category of public accountants called “tax collectors” (a structural benchmark at end-September
2014 not met). In addition to this reform toward a unified administration, our efforts will be
focused on regularly updating taxpayer rolls, improving tax supervision by developing surveys
and reports, and systematically mining the data collected as part of a risk analysis system.
35.
The drop in international crude oil prices is an important opportunity that we
intend to seize to hasten energy subsidy reform, which we already started, and could
improve the purchasing power of the population in the short term. To that end, we will
introduce—through the 2016 budget law—the reduction of domestic gasoline and diesel retail
prices to the international level, effective from January 1, 2016. This decrease—which will help
economic activity by reducing costs and improving purchasing power—will be accompanied by
the implementation of a symmetric automatic fuel price formula which has a smoothing
mechanism for large international price fluctuations, thus depoliticizing fuel pricing and ensuring
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

85

TUNISIA

its sustainability. This mechanism would replace the asymmetric formula introduced in
January 2014.
36.
We intend to improve the monitoring of public enterprises and the accompanying
institutional framework. The strategy for implementing a better model for monitoring the
performance of public enterprises—including by bringing all responsible entities under a new
agency in charge of monitoring public enterprises—will be completed in October 2015
(structural benchmark). This strategy will include recommendations from the recent evaluation of
internal controls in public enterprises. In addition, performance contracts on the management of
the five largest public enterprises (STEG, STIR, Cereals Office, Tunisair, and the National Tobacco
Authority) are being prepared and will be followed by performance contracts with financial
indicators (structural benchmark at end-October 2015). On the basis of the financial performance
of public enterprises, we will draw up a clear timetable of audits of the loss-making public
enterprises which, if necessary, will be followed by restructuring and recovery plans.
37.
The fiscal risks—including the availability of guarantees and new supporting
measures for the tourism sector—will be continuously assessed and monitored. Therefore,
the impact of discounts in Tunis Air flights and guarantees—granted by SOTUGAR for
exceptional loans to viable tourism establishments—will be assessed based on potential risks for
the budget. Also, the ceiling for state guarantees—including those given to banks—will be
limited to TD3 billion in 2015. In addition, a comprehensive evaluation of the fiscal risks related
to public enterprises—ongoing with IMF technical assistance—will result in a clear action plan for
reducing the risk stemming from those enterprises.
38.
Reforms in public expenditure management are moving forward, with the
preparation of a draft organic budget law—with technical assistance from the European Union
and France—which will be submitted to parliament in November 2015. This new law will propose
progress in all areas: budget design, budget reporting (new functional classification), expenditure
control, execution, and supervision. Furthermore, performance-based budgeting continues as
18 ministries (85 percent of the budget) have already prepared their budgets using the new
program classification and a multiyear framework. Better coordination between the Debt General
Directorate and the Treasury will also contribute to better management of the government’s cash
flow.

Structural reforms
39.
We are designing a new and comprehensive economic vision which will create jobs
and promote a competitive private sector that can generate inclusive growth. This strategy,
an initial outline of which was presented to the Council of Ministers in June, will serve as the
basis for organizing all the country’s economic policies and will determine the government’s
strategic orientation. It will translate into a five-year economic vision of social and economic
development (2016-2020), which will be presented at an international conference in early 2016.

86

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TUNISIA

40.
We are steadfastly continuing in moving forward towards completing the
government’s priority reforms. In this context, Parliament has adopted in September 2015 the
Law on Competition, which will help reduce government intervention in the economy, lighten the
burden on regulations, and enhance competition among enterprises. We also intend to complete
the following reforms, including through legislative approval by end-2015:


Bankruptcy Law (Law 95-34 on the recovery of enterprises in economic distress). In
addition to the reform of the banking law, we are committed to adopting a new bankruptcy
law. The draft of this law, prepared with the World Bank assistance, has already been
validated by the parliamentary committee and we anticipate that it will be adopted in
October 2015 after discussions in plenary session. This law will contribute to the
modernization, simplification, and acceleration of the process of voluntary and court-ordered
restructuring of viable enterprises and the liquidation of insolvent ones.



Law on public-private partnerships will facilitate private concessions under our public
investment program. The draft law submitted to parliament is being discussed with civil
society, and is expected to be adopted by December 2015.

41.
The new investment code is being completely overhauled, with a view to being
adopted in 2015. We have resumed work on completing the new investment code, which seeks
to implement a simpler and more transparent regulatory framework, to increase investor
protection and market access, and to streamline tax incentives (and refer to any that might still
exist to the tax code). The draft Investment Code will be presented to the Council of Ministers in
September 2015 and submitted to parliament in October 2015 in view of its adoption (along with
relevant implementation decrees) by November 2015 (structural benchmark).
42.
In addition to amending the legislation, we will continue to simplify administrative
procedures. To that end, we have already streamlined certain burdensome administrative
procedures for the private sector in the transport, customs, and export sectors. We remain
committed to further simplifying administrative procedures, in particular on the basis of the
results of the regulatory “guillotine.”
43.
We are committed to minimizing obstacles to the smooth functioning of the labor
market. Based on the results of the broad based dialogue with civil society started in 2013,
within the framework of the social contract, we have begun to reflect on the implementation of a
five-year vision for the labor market targeting: (i) an improvement in the employability of job
seekers; (ii) the development of an entrepreneurial culture; (iii) stimulation of labor demand;
(iv) public service intermediation; and (v) the reform of vocational training to serve business. This
vision will include a national employment strategy. Furthermore, we have already implemented
programs for the youth and the underprivileged regions (including vocational training
programs), for support to SMEs and microprojects (including microfinance), and for the creation
of social enterprises for young graduates in underprivileged areas.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

44.
Reliable statistical information is essential for monitoring and assessing
macroeconomic policies and implementing social programs. A comprehensive diagnosis of
our statistical system was finalized by Eurostat and our national account statistics (annual and
quarterly) as well as monetary and balance of payments statistics are being strengthened with
technical assistance from the IMF. In addition, a “National Statistical Charter,” prepared by the
National Council of Statistics promoting good statistical practices, is being reviewed and will be
adopted by the government, by the end of 2015. We are also committed to reducing the lag
time for publishing the statistics necessary for implementing economic policies on employment
or industrial production, or for compiling the annual national accounts. To that end, we
published, in April 2015, the preliminary results of the population and housing census conducted
in 2014, and are committed to meeting the deadline for executing and publishing the five-year
household survey.

C. Protection of the Most Vulnerable Groups
45.
The protection of vulnerable populations remains a priority for supporting the
implementation of fiscal and structural reforms. To this end, we completed the evaluation of
the program of assistance to vulnerable households (expanded to 235,000 families) and health
benefit cards (550,000), conducted based on a representative sample of 8,000 households. The
report will be published in October 2015 during a national conference aimed at developing the
strategic recommendations for better targeted and governed social safety net. This evaluation—
which revealed the inclusion and exclusion errors under the current system—and the finalization
of the unique social identifier, expected to be in place for vulnerable households during the third
quarter of this year, will contribute towards building a better targeted and, less fragmented,
social protection system, including through the establishment of a new register of vulnerable
households. We are aware that the reform of energy subsidies should be accompanied by a
better targeting mechanism and by a decision on the targeting method to be used, including to
identify vulnerable households.
46.
The deficit of the pension system calls for urgent reform. The CNRPS (National
Retirement and Social Security Fund) no available cash reserves and has posted an annual deficit
of 0.4 percent of GDP in 2015. To address these problems, and in the context of implementing
the social contract, including through the soon to be established National Council on Social
Dialogue, a comprehensive reform of the system will be designed. This reform would initially
propose that the retirement age be raised on a voluntary basis. This would be part of a
comprehensive reform of the pension system, which will including a revision of the parameters
for calculating pensions (for example, the replacement rate), the contribution rate, and the
benefits.

Attachment II. Technical Memorandum of Understanding
1.
This Memorandum establishes the agreement between the Tunisian authorities and IMF staff
concerning the definition of the quantitative performance criteria and indicative targets. It also sets
out the content and frequency of data reporting to IMF staff for program monitoring purposes.
2.
The quantitative criteria and targets are defined in Table 1 of the Memorandum of Economic
and Financial Policies (MEFP) attached to the Letter of Intent dated September 15, 2015. For
program purposes, all assets, liabilities, and flows denominated in foreign currencies will be valued
at the “program exchange rate,” as defined below, with the exception of items affecting the
government’s budgetary accounts, which will be measured at current exchange rates. For program
purposes, the exchange rate corresponds to the accounting exchange rate of the CBT prevailing on
December 31, 2012, as shown in the table below. For the SDR, the program exchange rate is
1 SDR = 2.38852 Tunisian dinars.

4.
For data reporting purposes, the Ministry of Economy and Finance, the National Institute of
Statistics (INS), and the Central Bank of Tunisia (CBT) will follow the rules and the format considered
appropriate for data reporting as covered by this technical memorandum of understanding, unless
otherwise agreed with IMF staff.

DEFINITION OF PERFORMANCE CRITERIA AND INDICATIVE TARGETS
A. Performance Criteria and Indicative Targets
5.
The quantitative performance criteria and indicative targets specified in Table 1 of the
MEFP are:
Performance criteria


A performance criterion (floor) on the net international reserves of the Central Bank of
Tunisia.



A performance criterion on the net domestic assets (ceiling) of the Central Bank of Tunisia.



A performance criterion (floor) on the primary balance of the central government, excluding
grants.



A performance criterion (ceiling) on total primary current expenditure of the central
government.



A continuous performance criterion on the accumulation of external arrears (zero ceiling).

Indicative targets


An indicative target (ceiling) on total domestic arrears.



An indicative target (floor) on capital expenditures in priority social sectors and social
programs.

6.
Measurement of criteria. The performance criteria on net international reserves and net
domestic assets are measured on a stock and quarterly basis. The performance criterion on the
central government deficit is measured on a quarterly basis and cumulatively from the end of the
previous year. Adjustment factors will also be applied to some of these criteria. The performance
criterion on the accumulation of external arrears is measured on a continuous basis.

B. Institutional Definition
7.
The central government comprises all ministries and agencies subject to central budgetary
administration in accordance with the organic law on the government budget. Regional
governments and municipalities subject to central budgetary administration are part of the central
government.

92

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TUNISIA

8.
The authorities will inform Fund staff of any new entity and any new program or special
budgetary or extra-budgetary fund created during the period of the program to carry out
operations of a budgetary nature. Such funds or new programs will be included in the definition of
the central government.

C. Floor on the Net International Reserves of the Central Bank of Tunisia
9.
The net international reserves (NIR) of the Central Bank of Tunisia (CBT) are defined as the
difference between the CBT’s reserve assets and its liabilities in foreign currency to nonresidents.1
10.
The CBT’s reserve assets are the foreign assets immediately available and under the CBT
control, as defined in the fifth edition of the IMF Balance of Payments Manual. They include gold,
SDR assets, reserve position at the IMF, convertible foreign currencies, liquid balances held outside
Tunisia, and negotiable foreign securities and bills purchased and discounted.
11.
The CBT’s liabilities in foreign currency to nonresidents include any commitment to sell
foreign currencies associated with financial derivative transactions (such as swaps, futures, options),
any portion of the CBT’s assets (gold, for example) used as collateral, IMF and Arab Monetary Fund
(AMF) credits outstanding, and deposits at the CBT of international organizations, foreign
governments, and foreign bank and nonbank institutions. The government’s foreign currency
deposits at the CBT are not included in the liabilities, nor is any SDR allocation received after
May 15, 2013.
12.
All debt instruments issued in foreign currency by the CBT on behalf of the government
before May 15, 2013 are also excluded as liabilities of the CBT. All debt instruments issued in foreign
currency by the CBT on behalf of the government after May 15, 2013 will be treated as CBT
liabilities, unless the offering documents (prospectus) state clearly that (i) the CBT is acting as an
agent to execute all sovereign debt instruments issued in foreign currency raised through the
international markets for general budgetary purposes of the Republic of Tunisia (ii) debt is a liability
of the central government; and (iii) a protocol between the CBT and the Ministry of Finance provides
clearly that the CBT is authorized to pay all expenses and costs pertaining to the implementation of

1
Deposits of residents in foreign currency (excluding government deposits) at the CBT are a form of external
liability of the CBT; for operational and accounting purposes, and because of legal considerations related to
the regulation of foreign exchange, the CBT includes residents’ foreign currency deposits in the monetary base.
To preserve the accounting consistency of the CBT’s accounts and be in line with the standard definition of NIR
within the framework of IMF stand-by arrangements, it is agreed: (i) to retain the accounting definition of
external liabilities used in the CBT balance at December 31, 2012; (ii) to adopt the principle of adjusting NIR
(in the opposite direction of the net domestic assets of the CBT) on the basis of the variation in the residents’
deposits in foreign currency from end-December of the previous year. It also agreed that the residents’
deposits in foreign currency at the CBT include the following components of reserve money:
intervention/monetary market in foreign currency, foreign currency of aggregate intermediaries, nonnegotiable placement of foreign currencies, and all other items operations in foreign currency (including
deposits and derivatives products) created or included in reserve money and resulting in a liability of the
Central Bank to residents. At end-March 2015, the value of the stock of deposits in foreign currencies of
residents at the CBT was $1,368.41 million at the program exchange rate.

this issue as well as the interest and principal of the issue sum through direct deduction from the
Treasury's current account established in the CBT's books.
13.
The value of CBT reserve assets and liabilities in foreign currency will be calculated using
program exchange rates (see Table above). On December 31, 2012, the value of the stock of net
international reserves was $7.937 billion, with the stock of reserve assets equal to $8.645 billion and
the stock of CBT liabilities in foreign currency equal to $730.399 million (at program rates).

D. Ceiling on Net Domestic Assets
14.
The CBT’s net domestic assets are defined as the difference between the monetary base
and the net foreign assets of the CBT.
15.
The monetary base includes: (i) fiduciary money (money in circulation outside the banks
and cash balances of commercial banks); (ii) deposits of commercial banks at the central bank
(including foreign currency and deposit facility); and (iii) deposits of all other sectors at the central
bank (i.e., other financial enterprises, households, and companies).
16.
The CBT’s net foreign assets are defined as the difference between the CBT’s gross foreign
assets, including foreign assets that are not part of the reserve assets, and all foreign liabilities of the
CBT. Net foreign assets are valued at the program exchange rate defined in the above table.

E. Floor on the Primary Balance of the Central Government (Excluding
Grants)
17.
Under the program, the primary fiscal balance of the central government (excluding
grants, on a cash basis) is measured on a financing basis and will be the negative sum of: (i) total
net external financing; (ii) privatization receipts; (iii) net domestic bank financing; (iv) net domestic
nonbank financing; plus (v) interest on domestic and external debt paid by the central government
and less external budgetary grants received by the central government.
18.
Total net external financing is defined as net external loans of the government, that is:
new loan disbursements, less repayments of the principal. Project and budgetary loans of the central
government are included, as well as any form of debt used to finance central government
operations.
19.
Privatization receipts are the government receipts from the sale of any government asset.
This includes revenues from the sale of government shares in public and private enterprises, sales of
nonfinancial assets, sales of licenses, and the sale of confiscated assets, excluding the confiscation of
bank accounts. For the adjustor in NIR (see below), only receipts in foreign currency are included.
20.
Net domestic bank financing of the central government is the sum of: the change in net
bank loans to the central government (in Tunisian dinars and foreign currency) and the change in
central government deposits at the CBT (this includes all central government accounts at the CBT, in
particular (i) Treasury current account; (ii) Tunisian government account (miscellaneous dinar

TUNISIA

accounts); (iii) loan accounts; (iv) grant accounts; (v) FONAPRA-FOPRODI accounts; (vi) special
account of Tunisian government in foreign currency; (vii) current accounts of paying U.S. Treasury;
(viii) accounts in foreign currency pending adjustment (subaccount: available); (ix) and any other
account that may be opened by the central government at the CBT. Following the unification of
government accounts at the CBT into a Single Treasury Account, government accounts are
consolidated in two categories (“Compte Central du Government “and “Comptes Spéciaux du
Government”) on the CBT’s balance sheet (liabilities side).
21.
Net government borrowing from the banking system is defined as the change in the
stock of government securities (Treasury bills and bonds) held by banks and any other central
government borrowing from banks, less repayments. The stock of nonnegotiable bonds issued to
banks during the recapitalization of public banks, and which are serviced entirely by the
government, is excluded from bank claims on the government.
22.
Net domestic nonbank financing includes: the change in the stock of government
securities (Treasury bills and bonds) held by nonbanks (including social security funds) and any other
central government borrowing from nonbanks, less repayments. Total Treasury bills and other public
debt instruments to be taken into consideration are calculated at the nominal/face value shown on
the institutions’ balance sheet and does not include accrued interest.

F. Ceiling on Central Government Primary Current Expenditure (excluding
Interest Payments on Public Debt)
23.
Under the program, central government primary current expenditure is defined as the sum
of central government expenditure on: (i) personnel wages and salaries; (ii) goods and services;
(iii) transfers and subsidies; (iv) other unallocated current expenditure2.

G. Ceiling on the Accumulation of External Arrears
24.
Arrears on external debt payment are defined as late payments (principal and interest) on
external debt or guarantees as defined in External Debt Statistics: Guide for compilers3 by the central
2

The methodologies used to measure current expenditure categories for the central government are those
used to design the table of central government financial operations presented in the macroeconomic
framework.

The definition of debt set forth in External Debt Statistics: Guide for Compilers reads as the outstanding
amount of those actual current, and not contingent, liabilities, created under a contractual arrangement
through the provision of value in the form of assets (including currency) or services, and which require
payment(s) of principal and/or interest by the debtor at some point(s) in the future and that are owed to
nonresidents by residents of an economy. Debts owed to nonresidents can take a number of forms, the
primary ones being as follows: (i) loans, that is, advances of money to obligor by the lender made on the basis
of an undertaking that the obligor will repay the funds in the future (including deposits, bonds, debentures,
commercial loans, and buyers’ credits) and temporary exchanges of assets that are equivalent to fully
collateralized loans under which the obligor is required to repay the funds, and usually pay interest, by
repurchasing the collateral from the buyer in the future (such as repurchase agreements and official swap
arrangements); (ii) suppliers’ credits, that is, contracts where the supplier permits the obligor to defer payments
until sometime after the date on which the goods are delivered or services are provided; and (iii) leases, that is,

government or the CBT after 90 days from the due date or the expiration of the applicable grace
period.

H. Indicative Ceiling on the Accumulation of Domestic Arrears
25.
For program purposes, arrears on domestic debt payment are defined as amounts owed to
domestic financial and commercial creditors that are 90 days or more overdue with respect to a
specific maturity date (or as defined in the contractual grace period, if any). If no maturity date is
specified, arrears are defined as amounts owed to domestic creditors that remain unpaid 90 days or
more after the date on which the contract was signed or upon receipt of the invoice.

I. Indicative Floor on Social Expenditures
26.
Social expenditures are defined as capital expenditures (development expenditures) on
education, health, social transfers to needy families, the AMEL employment training program (and
university scholarships), UTSS indemnities, family allocation as well as development expenditures of
the Ministry of Women and Family Affairs, Youth and Sports and Social Affairs; all current
expenditures (“dépenses de gestion”) of the above-mentioned sectors and programs, as well as food
and energy subsidies, are excluded.

J. Adjustment Factors for the Program Performance Criteria
27.
The NIR targets are adjusted upward (downward) if the cumulative sum of net external
financing of the central government (excluding project loans and any access to capital markets), the
sum of budgetary grants, privatization receipts received in foreign currency, the increase (decrease)
in the residents’ foreign currency deposits at the CBT are greater (lower) than the levels observed in
the table below. The NIR targets will be also adjusted upward (downward) if the total amount of
cash payments on external debt service of the government is greater (lower) than the levels included
in the table below.

arrangements under which property is provided which the lessee has the right to use for one or more specified
period(s) of time that are usually shorter than the total expected service life of the property, while the lessor
retains the title to the property.

28.
The net domestic assets (NDA) targets will be adjusted upward (downward) based on the
downward (upward) adjustment of the NIR floor if the cumulative sum of net external financing of
the central government (excluding project loans and any access to capital markets), the sum of
budgetary grants, privatization receipts received in foreign currency, the increase (decrease) in
residents’ foreign currency deposits at the CBT are lower (greater) than the levels indicated in the
following table. The NDA targets are also adjusted upward (downward) based on the downward
(upward) adjustment of the NIR floor if the total amount of cash payments on external debt service
are greater (lower) than the levels included in the table below. The NDA ceiling will be converted
into Tunisian dinars at the program exchange rate.
29.
The ceilings on the NDA of the CBT will also be adjusted downward or upward based on
the amount of CBT reserves released/mobilized because of a possible decrease/increase in the
reserve requirement.
30.
The floor on the primary balance of the central government, excluding grants, will be
adjusted upward/downward based on the amount used to recapitalize the public banks. The
recapitalization amounts for Q3 2015 are assumed to be 110 million dinars.

K. Monitoring and Reporting Requirements
31.
Performance under the program will be monitored using data supplied to the IMF by the
Tunisian authorities as outlined in the table below, consistent with the program definitions above.
The authorities will promptly transmit to the IMF staff any data revisions.

Safeguards Assessments
The first-time safeguards assessment of the Central Bank of Tunisia (CBT) was finalized in June 2013.
The assessment found an adequate control environment for the day-to-day operations, but
oversight, autonomy, and transparency needed strengthening. The CBT publishes its audited
financial statements in a timely manner, but the assessment recommended that disclosure
information be enhanced. The CBT balance sheet was exposed to risks resulting from liquidity
lending operations. These were mitigated by subsequent program measures related to inter-alia the
collateral framework. The assessment also recommended measures to strengthen the internal audit
function and enhance the oversight by the CBT Audit Committee.

Exchange Rate Arrangement
Tunisia accepted the obligations of Article VIII Sections 2(a), 3, and 4 effective January 6, 1993, and
maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on executing payments and transfers on
current international transactions except that Tunisia maintains (a) a multiple currency practice
resulting from honoring exchange rate guarantees extended prior to August 1988 to development
banks, which will automatically expire after maturity of existing commitments (total loans covered by
these guarantees amount to about $20 million); and (b) certain restrictions relating to Iraq and the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), pursuant to UN Security Council
Resolutions, which are subject to notification to the Fund in accordance with Decision 144 (52/51).
The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating as indicated on the Central Bank of Tunisia (CBT)
web site. Effective April 18, 2012, a fixing (i.e. the average of market participants’ quotes) replaced
the currency composite as the reference exchange rate published by the CBT. Since then, the CBT
intervened in the foreign exchange market through bilateral transactions when market quotes
deviated substantially from the fixing rate of the day. Previously, the CBT intervened in the foreign
exchange market to keep the exchange rate stable vis-à-vis a currency composite using its own rates
in response to requests from banks for quotes. The rates quoted by the CBT were based on the
currency composite and updated continuously to reflect the exchange rates prevailing in the
international foreign exchange market. During the transition to the new operational framework,
since September 2011, the CBT has adjusted the level of the exchange rates vis-à-vis the currency
composite. However, the dinar has followed a depreciating trend vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar within a
margin of less than 2 percent through December 2014. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is
classified as to a crawl-like arrangement. The CBT posts, effective January 1, 2011, the volume of
transactions between authorized intermediaries, and the volume of its daily interventions in the
interbank foreign exchange market on its website.”
On June 15, 2015, the interbank rate of the dinar vis-à-vis the dollar was $1=TD 1.937, equivalent to
SDR 1=TD 2.7276

Article IV Consultation
Tunisia is under 31 month SBA program with quarterly reviews since June 2013. The last Article IV
consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on July 25, 2012.

FSAP Participation and ROSCS
The last FSAP update was conducted during January 11-25, 2012. Tunisia participated in the
Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) in 2002 and an FSAP update was conducted in 2006.

AML/CFT Assessment
Tunisia’s anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) framework
was assessed in 2006 against the AML/CFT standard, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF)
Recommendations. The evaluation was conducted by the World Bank in the context of the FSAP
update. The final report indicated that Tunisia had adopted an AML/CFT law, and the criminalization
of money laundering and the financing of terrorism were broadly in line with international
standards, nonetheless, some key weaknesses were identified. In line with the authorities’ intention
to strengthen their AML /CFT framework, a new assessment of the AML/CFT regime is currently
being conducted.

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
(As of May 18, 2015)
A new Interim Strategy Note (ISN, FY13-14) outlines the Bank Group support to postrevolution Tunisia. The new ISN was discussed by the World Bank Board of Executive Directors on
July 3, 2012. The ISN updates a Country Partnership Strategy (CPS, FY10-13) which appeared
inadequate to respond to the new country context. The new ISN has been prepared jointly with the
IFC, with participation from MIGA, and it supported a program that promotes private sector-led
recovery and job creation, with a focus on openness, opportunity and accountability. To achieve its
overarching objective of supporting employment creation, the Bank Group framed its support within
three Areas of Engagement: (i) Laying the Foundation for Renewed Sustainable Growth and Job
Creation; (ii) Promoting Social and Economic Inclusion; and (iii) Strengthening Governance: Voice,
Transparency and Accountability. The IFC has also strengthened its engagement and appointed a
staff in Tunis. The World Bank has recently completed a Systematic Country Diagnostic, which
reviews Tunisia’s challenges in achieving both poverty reduction and inclusiveness. The upcoming
development plan (2016-20) of the new Government—to be presented during the forthcoming
donors’ conference—will be the basis of the Country Partnership Framework jointly prepared by the
World Bank, the IFC and MIGA.

Lending Volumes
Following the 2011 revolution, the Tunisia portfolio witnessed a sharp weakening of performance
indicators which had eventually begun to recover FY14/FY15. While lending initially peaked in FY11
with the approval of the $500 million Governance & Opportunities DPL and a $50 million MSME
Financing Facility, there were no new IBRD commitments in FY1 —the Bank was preparing a number
of key operations during this period and presented an Interim Strategy Note in early July 2012, while
Tunisia experienced a heightening of post-revolution political, economic and social challenges.
In FY2013, commitments began to climb again as the reform program moved forward and the
Governance, Opportunities and Jobs DPL series came on line. By FY14, new investment lending
operations were approved and in early FY15, a $300 million Urban Development and Local
governance operation was approved by the Board, using the new program for results lending
instrument.

On-Going Portfolio
Tunisia’s current active portfolio, with a net commitment of $1.12 billion (as of May 2015), includes
one $300 million Program for Results (P4R) operation supporting municipal services, approved in
July 2014, one fully disbursed DPL operation of $250 million and nine Investment Project Financing
(IPF) operations totaling US$519 million. In addition, it also includes 12 grants, representing
a commitment of $50.3 million. The total undisbursed amount is $642 million (57 percent of the
total commitment).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TUNISIA

With the current active portfolio at over $1 billion, World Bank lending commitments to Tunisia are
at their highest ever. However, disbursements for investment lending (IPFs) during FY14 were a
modest $27.64 million and only reached $20.23 million for FY15. The investment lending
disbursement ratio slowed from 20.1 percent in FY11 to 11.1 percent in FY12 and then peaked to
reach 19.9 in FY13. In FY14, the disbursement ratio slowed down again and reached the level of
15.4 percent
The slower investment lending disbursement rate, delays in preparation of new small grants and
some implementation issues can be attributed to disruptions caused by the revolution and political
transition, including delays with decentralized entities and with the awarding of contracts for
projects that required investor participation.

RELATIONS WITH THE EUROPEAN BANK FOR
RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
(As of June 19, 2015)
Following the Arab Spring, Tunisia and three other countries of the Southern and Eastern
Mediterranean region (Egypt, Morocco and Jordan) requested country of operation status at the
EBRD in 2011. Tunisia became a member of the Bank in December 2011 and was granted
recipient/country of operations status in June 2012.
The EBRD started its activities through technical assistance and policy dialogue, followed by
investments. It opened its fully operational office in June 2013 and has built an investment portfolio
of 18 transactions, committing a total of more than EUR 250 million, all in the private sector.
Investments in the financial sector currently dominate the portfolio, focusing on supporting SMEs
through credit lines to local banks and equity investments in private equity funds. In addition, the
EBRD signed trade facilitation agreements with two local banks to facilitate foreign trade and
support local banks import export transactions. The Bank has also financed directly a number of
private corporates in agribusiness, automotive and telecommunication sectors and continues to
pursue active business development and market efforts for investment opportunities.
There are presently 18 donor-funded technical assistance assignments in Tunisia supported by a
€3 million donor funding, including such country-specific assignments as: a Transport Sector Review,
an Assessment of the Sub-Sovereign Financing Framework, a Sustainable Energy Initiative study, an
Environmental and Social Assessment, and a Country Law Assessment.
Tunisia is also benefiting from 41 regional assignments for about €33 million of approved funding.
These include the Food Security Initiative in the region, the implementation of small business
support (SBS) advisory services that provide tailored financial and managerial training for SMEs; local
capital market development; the expansion of the Local Enterprise Facility and the Direct Company
Assistance program for agribusiness companies.
The SBS program in Tunisia has provided direct technical assistance for nearly 150 SME for a total
amount of €2 million of donor funds. The EBRD is scaling up its SBS activities with an extra €10
million funding received from EU under the Programme d’Appui a la Competitivite des Services
(PACS Program), which will benefit services sectors, tourism and handicrafts. The agreement with the
EU was signed in June 2015 and envisages the implementation over the next 5 years.
To support Tunisia in tackling its structural reform challenges, the EBRD plans to focus its operations
along the following priorities, in coordination with other IFIs and bilateral agencies:


Financial sector. The priority is to help bank restructuring and broaden financial sector access
to support private sector development so as to address a number of structural deficiencies in

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

9

TUNISIA

the sector, including the prevalence of weak state-owned banks and limited access to finance for
SMEs as well as the lack of a functioning local capital market.


Modernization of industry through the private sector. Tunisia’s private sector requires
support in order to promote higher value added production and sustainable job creation.



Power and energy sector. The priority is to support energy efficiency and improve energy
security and the development of a sustainable energy sector.



Infrastructure sector. The EBRD plans to facilitate non-sovereign financing for infrastructure to
provide wider access to better quality urban and more efficient public services

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TUNISIA

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of end-August 2015)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is adequate for surveillance but it should be strengthen in the financial sector.
National Accounts: In December 2010, the National Institute of Statistics (NSI) published a revised national
accounts series covering the period 1997–2009 based on SNA 1993 (instead of, as before, SNA 1968). Following
international guidelines, a chained-index approach is now used to estimating GDP growth. Quarterly GDP series
consistent with this revision have been recently disseminated at constant prices and at current prices on the NSI
website. These improvements are welcome, and should provide a better indication of economic activity
developments and trends in Tunisia. Surveillance would benefit from the collection and dissemination of higher
frequency data on employment, unemployment, and wages. Tunisia utilizes a periodicity and timeliness flexibility
option for the labor market data category under the SDDS. Since end-2011, quarterly employment and
unemployment data are disseminated with a timeline of three months.
Government finance statistics: While Tunisia produces annual general government data and quarterly
budgetary central government cash flow in the GFSM 2001 framework, some areas for improvement remain. The
depth of the budgetary central government should be improved to include one quarter timeliness and quarterly
financial balance sheet information.
Monetary statistics: The Central Bank of Tunisia (CBT) has not yet migrated to the Standardized Report Forms
(SRFs) to report monetary and financial statistics. The CBT has started to develop the SRF 1SR (Standardized
Report Form for the Central Bank) and is planning to request technical assistance from STA for reviewing and
validating the 1SR and to provide recommendations on the migration to the SRF 2SR (Standardized Report Form
for other depository corporations).
Balance of payments: Are generally adequate for surveillance, although greater details for quarterly BOP and
development of a quarterly IIP are needed. Improvements in key areas, which would also support transition to
BPM6, are dependent on the development of additional source data including accessing the existing
administrative databases at the CBT and other government agencies. Major expected changes from the adoption
of BPM6 may broadly result in: (i) a larger goods balance deficit, mainly due to the removal of goods for
processing gross flows; (ii) a relative increase in the services balance (addition of goods for processing fees, FISIM,
repairs, etc.); (iii) a decline in the primary income balance (recording of reinvested earnings in the debits); (iv)
changes in the financial account due to improvements in coverage and reclassification of transactions by
functional category.
Financial indicators: Financial indicators are available with significant lag and their accuracy is challenged by
problems in the banking supervision information system and data base management.

II. Data Standards and Quality
Subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination Standard
(SDDS) June 20, 2001.

A data ROSC was published on the IMF website on
August 9, 2006.

III. Reporting to STA (Optional)
Data are being reported for publication in the International Financial Statistics (IFS), Government Finance Statistics
Yearbook, the Direction of Trade Statistics, and the Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
September 30, 2015

This statement reports on the recent agreement to increase wages during 2016–18 and the
implementation of the prior actions since the Staff Report was issued on September 17, 2015.
The information does not alter the thrust of the Staff Appraisal.
1.
The Tunisian government and the main labor union signed an agreement for
another round of public sector wage increases for 2016–18. The authorities considered
this agreement—which was signed on September 22, 2015—as essential to reduce social
tensions during the next two years. Based on preliminary data, staff estimates that the annual
4–5 percent generalized salary increase in 2016 will add 0.4 percent of GDP to the wage bill
in the absence of compensating measures. Staff regrets this latest increase—which will add to
an already unsustainable wage bill and hurt competitiveness of the Tunisian economy. Staff
urges the authorities to introduce compensating measures in the 2016 budget to contain wage
increases within the existing wage bill. Moving quickly ahead with a comprehensive civil
service reform is also essential to contain and eventually reduce the wage bill.
2.
The recapitalization of Banque de l’Habitat (BH) has been completed. BH was
recapitalized on September 12, with a capital injection of 110 million dinars. Existing
shareholders—the state (with 57 percent) and private shareholders—both contributed in line
with their initial shares. The capital injection, together with explicit state guarantees for BH
related to claims outstanding on public enterprises (prior action) issued in September 2015,
increased BH’s end-March Tier 1 capital ratio to 7.2 percent and the capital adequacy ratio to
about 10 percent. This meets the prior action on BH recapitalization, as verified by the
bank’s auditors.
3.
The Société Tunisienne des Banques (STB) has been recapitalized. The first phase
of the subscription process ended on September 14 (prior action), and all phases of the capital
subscription—bringing total capital to 776.8 million dinars—were completed on September
18, about one month ahead of schedule. Interest in STB by existing private shareholders was
modest, resulting in the government share increasing from 51 percent to close to 80 percent.
Explicit guarantees for STB (prior action) were issued in a lesser amount than expected
(about half), on grounds of smaller outstanding claims on public enterprises. The authorities
expect this to be sufficient to bring Tier 1 capital above 7 percent as of end-June; this and the
resulting level of total capital will be verified following the certification of the end-June
accounts in October.
4.
Staff welcomes the actions taken to ensure banks meet prudential norms. It
stresses the importance of quickly completing the update of existing business plans, which
will help ensure regulatory compliance throughout the restructuring period. Staff also urges
the authorities to introduce strategic partners in STB and BH, including to help with the
restructuring process.

Statement by Jafar Mojarrad, Executive Director for Tunisia,
Mr. Mohammed Daïri, Alternate Executive Director,
Mr. Abdelali Jbili, Senior Advisor, and Ms. Monia Saadaoui, Advisor
September 30, 2015
On behalf of our Tunisian authorities, we thank staff for the excellent report on the
Article IV consultation and the sixth review under the Stand-By Arrangement. Our
authorities appreciate the quality of engagement with Fund staff, which has been
beneficial throughout the program period, and express their deep appreciation to Fund
management and the Executive Board for their continued support during the difficult
political transition. Staff analysis and policy recommendations are in line with the
authorities’ own assessment and policies.
Overview
Tunisia has successfully completed a political transition, which was long, arduous, and
fraught with risks. But the outcome is highly positive as democratic institutions have
been solidly anchored in dialogue and political consensus. As highlighted during the
Managing Director’s visit to Tunisia, resilience in the political, social, and economic
fields has been the hallmark of this transition. The Tunisian authorities’ perseverance in
holding the line in the economic field are noteworthy, especially when their efforts are
seen against the background of the tragic terrorist attacks, social unrest, conflict in a
neighboring country, and depressed external demand. Despite these shocks, growth has
remained positive, inflation is contained, pressure on the exchange rate has abated, and
fiscal and external imbalances remain manageable.
The authorities share staff views about the outlook and potential risks, even though they
expect some upside from continued recovery in Europe, low oil prices, and easing of
social tensions. They are determined to do the utmost to mitigate these risks that are
under their control. The current government, which took office in February 2015 with a
five-year mandate, has expressed its determination to improve security and combat
terrorism, further strengthen macroeconomic stability, accelerate the implementation of
structural reforms to foster growth and employment, and continue to rely on dialogue,
good governance, and communication in addressing social issues.
Looking ahead, the authorities are in the process of formulating a new vision for
economic and social development, which will lay down the priorities and major strategic
orientations through a development plan for the period 2016–2020. A first draft of this
strategy was submitted to the Council of Ministers in June 2015 and is expected to be
showcased at an international conference in early 2016.

2
Recent economic developments
The economic recovery has been derailed by the tragic terrorist attacks of the Bardo
museum and Sousse, which severely affected tourism activity and investor confidence,
with adverse impact on growth and the balance of payments. In addition, a significant
increase in the number and duration of strikes in the first half of the year led to the
complete cessation of phosphate production for two months and contributed to growth
deceleration. Growth projections have now been revised down to 1 percent in 2015, or
about half last year’s level. However, inflation remains contained; it fell to 4.2 percent in
August 2015 and is expected to reach 4.4 percent in December 2015, reflecting a
continuation of the gradual tightening of monetary policy by the central bank of Tunisia
(CBT) as well as lower energy and food prices. Unemployment has declined to
15.2 percent in the second quarter of 2015 but remains high, especially for youth and
women.
Due to the fall in world oil prices and sluggish economic activity, which contributed to a
significant decline of imports, the current account deficit is expected to improve slightly
in 2015, but would remain elevated at 8 ½ percent of GDP. The US$1 billion
international bond issue in January 2015 and disbursement of multilateral loans are
expected to keep gross international reserves at the equivalent of 4 months of imports by
the end-2015. Access to the international financial market without third party guarantee
at relatively favorable terms attests to continued market confidence in Tunisia.
Program implementation
Program implementation has been adequate in light of Tunisia’s exceptional
circumstances and the challenges highlighted above. All quantitative performance criteria
for end-December 2014 and end-March 2015 were met, most of them with comfortable
margins. The floor on the primary fiscal balance was met with a wide margin, and the
indicative ceiling on current expenditure was also met. However, the indicative ceiling on
social spending was missed due to persistent difficulties in the delivery mechanism in
remote regions. Continued under-execution of capital spending under the budget reflected
capacity absorption difficulties in the post-revolution period, as recognized by staff,
rather than an intended adjustment measure.
Implementation of the authorities’ structural reform agenda has been more challenging
than expected given the unsettled social environment during the political transition and
the need to build consensus on major reforms and pieces of legislation. Nonetheless,
significant progress has been made in a number of areas, including the adoption of bank
restructuring plans.

3
Based on the performance under the SBA, the Tunisian authorities request completion of
the sixth review, agree on the proposed new performance criteria for end-September 2015
and the timetable for structural benchmarks as described in the MEFP, and request a
rephasing of disbursements, with the final tranche of SDR 143.25 million to be made
available upon completion of the seventh and last review under the SBA.
Macroeconomic policies
Fiscal policy
Fiscal adjustment in 2014 was better than programmed. The central government
structural deficit (excluding the effects of the economic cycle and the cost of bank
recapitalization) stood at 3.3 percent of GDP at end 2014, against a program target of
4.1 percent of GDP and 5.3 percent in 2012. This has been achieved mainly due to
increased revenue mobilization (including VAT and the exceptional contribution on
income), leading to an increase in the revenue-to-GDP ratio, and a significant decline in
expenditures, including from under-execution of public investment, as mentioned above.
Adverse developments in 2015 and a difficult international economic environment
prompted the authorities to moderately ease fiscal policy to support growth and address
the new security challenges. A supplementary budget law introduced measures aimed at
increasing security expenditure, supporting the tourism sector, and strengthening
programs for small and medium enterprises (MEFP ¶8-10). It also provided for a
5 percent general salary increase, including for regularization of past wage agreements,
while deferring recruitments and implementation of specific wage increases concluded
and not yet implemented. This measure was intended to ease mounting social tensions.
The authorities are firmly committed to take additional measures to attain their fiscal
objectives in 2015, including through reduction of non-essential non-wage expenditure.
They are committed to fiscal adjustment from 2016 onwards. In this regard, they intend
to seize the opportunity of low international oil prices to accelerate the reform of energy
subsidies. They will introduce in the 2016 budget an automatic oil price adjustment
formula to replace the asymmetrical formula adopted in January 2014. In parallel, they
are accelerating the preparation of major tax and public finance management reforms,
which would bring about lasting improvements in the fiscal situation, improve equity,
and reduce public debt. Plans are also underway to accelerate the execution of public
investments through a series of measures to strengthen coordination between the
governorates and the central government, implement new procurement procedures, and
improve monitoring and execution.
A comprehensive reform of the civil service will be critical to modernize the public
administration and contain the growth of the wage bill. To this effect, a strategy will be

4
formulated in consultation with the National Council of Social Dialogue, which will help
gradually lower the wage bill to about 11 percent of GDP over the medium-term.
Despite the increase in the overall fiscal deficit since 2011, Tunisia’s public debt remains
sustainable and low in comparison with regional peers. Over the medium-term and under
stress scenarios developed in the DSA, public debt is expected to remain sustainable.
Tunisia has had an impeccable record of meeting its debt obligations.
Monetary and exchange rate policy
The gradual monetary policy tightening and declining international commodity prices has
helped contain inflation. The central bank has kept the policy rate unchanged at a level
which is considered adequate in view of the weak economic activity and sluggish credit
demand. Moreover, with the convergence of the money market rate and the policy rate,
the latter has become a more effective signaling tool. The CBT remains vigilant to
address possible inflationary pressures from second round effects of wage increases or
exchange rate depreciation.
The authorities continue to modernize and strengthen the monetary policy framework.
Changes have been introduced to reduce risks to the central bank from refinancing
operations, and work is underway in cooperation with the Banque de France to
modernize the operational framework of monetary policy, including improving the
quality of liquidity forecasts and deepening the interbank market. The draft law on the
central bank was presented to the CBT’s Board of Directors in June 2015, and is expected
to be submitted for parliamentary approval in October 2015. The draft, which has
benefited from Fund technical assistance, aims at granting the CBT greater autonomy and
better definition of its mandate by adding financial stability to its goal of price stability
while strengthening its governance, transparency, and accountability framework.
Exchange rate policy has appropriately responded to market developments, allowing the
dinar to continue to reflect movements in fundamentals. Interventions in the foreign
exchange market helped smooth excessive fluctuations following the Bardo attack. The
authorities remain committed to further increasing exchange rate flexibility and
deepening the foreign exchange market. To this effect, the Board of Directors of the CBT
adopted in May 2015 a series of measures, including the introduction of foreign exchange
auctions to give more weight to the market in determining the value of the dinar
(MEFP19). Implementation of weekly foreign exchange auctions is to start in
October 2015 (structural benchmark).

5
Financial sector stability
Financial sector stability remains a top priority, and progress has been made toward
advancing the reform in many areas with a particular focus on: (i) recapitalization and
restructuring of public banks, (ii) introduction of a bank resolution scheme, a deposit
guarantee scheme, and lender-of-last resort mechanism, and (iii) strengthening of banking
supervision.
Following legislative approval in August 2015, the recapitalization of the three public
banks for up to 1 billion dinars (1 percent of GDP) is underway, consistent with
international practices. Restructuring plans were approved for two banks, subscriptions to
capital increases were closed for Banque de l’Habitat (BH), the Société Tunisienne des
Banques (STB), and sale of non strategic assets for the Banque Nationale Agricole
(BNA) are ongoing. Moreover, the government is committed to ensuring that the updated
business plans of the recapitalized banks will be carried out in light of the changed
economic environment. The CBT will also strengthen the supervision of public banks to
ensure that they fully comply with prudential requirements. Performance contracts will be
developed to ensure the convergence of public banks’ performance indicators to those of
the private sector, which will be done on a consolidated basis for selected indicators
(structural benchmark for end November 2015). The authorities are actively working to
address the NPL problem, including through a draft revised law on bankruptcy, which is
expected to be approved by parliament in October 2015. In addition, exceptional and
urgent measures have been taken to support the tourism sector following the Sousse
attack. These measures will be subject to special prudential monitoring as detailed in
MEFP ¶25.
In parallel, important steps have been taken to strengthen the governance of public banks
and move ahead with their restructuring. New board members representing the
government have been appointed, and the functions of chairman and CEO have been
separated, while the role of the board, its committees, and senior management will be
redefined. Moreover, to bring the necessary expertise in management and risk
assessment, a tender will be launched in the last quarter of 2015 for the selection of an
investment bank to help with the process of entry of technical/strategic partners in the
capital of banks.
Medium-term structural reforms
Over the medium-term, the authorities plan to make decisive progress on wide-ranging
structural reforms to improve the business climate, attract private sector investment, and
enhance efficiency and competitiveness. A number of key reforms are already at an
advanced stage of preparation, including a major overhaul of the tax system and
modernization of tax administration, reform of the investment code, and the bankruptcy

6
law. Other reforms, which require further preparatory work and consultations, will be
introduced in the 2016-20 development plan, including labor market reform, restructuring
of public enterprises, public expenditure management, civil service reform, and pension
reform.
The authorities appreciate the analytical work carried out by staff in the Selected Issues
Paper on Tunisia’s growth potential and take a positive note of the reforms needed to
unleash this potential. They are aware of the impediments to the business environment,
many of them are part of the legacy of the pre-revolution regime, and are determined to
address them in close collaboration with stake holders and international partners.
Conclusion
Tunisia continues to face daunting challenges, exacerbated by the two terrorist attacks,
but has shown resilience and firm determination to implement its reform agenda under
the Fund-supported program. The authorities are committed to pursue a medium-term
strategy focused on fostering growth and job creation while reducing macroeconomic
imbalances. They look forward to continued close collaboration with the Fund and other
partners toward achieving their objectives.
