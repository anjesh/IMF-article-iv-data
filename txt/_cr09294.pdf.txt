EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The consultation discussions focused on assessing the impact of the global financial crisis on the
Libyan economy and the need to enhance the quality of public expenditure and public finance
management, address the factors contributing to the excess liquidity in the banking sector, and
advance structural reforms to support non-oil growth, diversification, and employment creation.
Economic developments and outlook
Libya’s macroeconomic performance in 2008 was strong, with real GDP growth at about 4 percent,
and record fiscal and external surpluses. The outlook has been adversely affected by the global crisis
mostly through a decline in oil prices and output. However, the large public expenditure program for
2009 will help moderate the impact on non-oil growth. Overall growth is projected to decelerate to
about 2 percent in 2009, but non-oil growth is projected to remain buoyant, at around 6 percent. The
sharp drop in oil prices will reduce the fiscal and external current account surpluses. The outlook is
projected to improve gradually over the medium term with the global recovery. This outlook is
subject to downside risks relating to a further worsening in global economic conditions or a wavering
of the efforts to improve the quality of public expenditure and advance structural reforms.
Authorities’ views

The impact of the global crisis has been limited to the decline in oil revenue. However, it
provides some opportunities as projects can be implemented at lower costs than during the boom.


Efforts to stabilize public spending and enhance its quality will continue.

Investment funds have a role to play in the diversification strategy. They are intended to operate
on a commercial basis and in areas where the private sector has minor involvement.



Implementation of financial sector and other structural reforms will continue to promote the
private sector and create viable employment opportunities.


Staff’s recommendations
Greater emphasis should be placed on the quality and composition of public expenditure,
including by limiting the growth of current expenditure.


The proliferation of investment funds outside the budget increases the risk of complicating
public expenditure management, incurring potential losses, and crowding out the private sector.




Reducing the large excess liquidity, in particular by establishing a Treasury Single Account
(TSA) and limiting on-lending by the specialized credit institutions (SCIs), would give more traction
to monetary policy.

The commendable efforts to reform the financial sector and enhance the monetary policy
framework should continue, including by extending the range of maturities and developing an auction
mechanism for the certificates of deposit (CDs) of the Central Bank of Libya (CBL).


The dinar’s peg to the SDR continues to serve Libya well.

I. BACKGROUND AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
A. Introduction
1.
The discussions were held against the backdrop of declining oil revenue, a small
decline in public expenditure, and moderate deceleration in non-oil growth. The ongoing
normalization of diplomatic relations with the U.S. and the EU since 2007 continues to
contribute to foreign investors’ interest, particularly in the hydrocarbon, banking, and
infrastructure sectors. Further spending under the Wealth Distribution Program (WDP),
which was launched in March 2008 to distribute part of the oil wealth to the population and
reduce the size of the government, has been put on hold over concerns about its potential
impact on inflation and the provision of basic public services.
2.
Past Fund policy advice has centered on the need to restore fiscal prudence,
strengthen oil revenue management, develop a well-designed strategy to restructure public
commercial banks, and advance structural reforms. The authorities have launched a number
of initiatives over the past few years to address these issues and modernize the economy.
Notable progress has been made in bank privatization, sovereign wealth management, budget
unification, and encouraging the private sector. These achievements have contributed to the
favorable sovereign ratings assigned to the country earlier this year by international rating
agencies. At the same time, important challenges remain to be addressed in order to achieve
the authorities’ objectives of increasing non-oil growth and creating viable employment
opportunities. These challenges include improving public finance management, further
advancing financial sector reforms, enhancing the regulatory framework, and accelerating
structural reforms to reduce the size of the government and promote private sector
development.
B. Recent Economic Developments
3.
The impact of the global financial crisis on Libya has been thus far limited to the
decline in oil revenue. This was due to the lack of exposure of domestic banks to the global
financial system. In addition, Libya's foreign assets consist mainly of foreign reserves, and
the portfolio of the Libyan Investment Authority (LIA). The LIA started its operations in
June 2007 and a large part of its assets consists of bank deposits.
4.
Macroeconomic performance was strong in 2008. Preliminary data indicate that
real GDP grew by about 3.8 percent. Non-oil growth was broad-based and estimated at 8
percent. Oil output increased slightly at the first three quarters of the year then declined in the
last quarter in line with OPEC’s quota reduction. As a result, production for the year as a
whole was similar to its 2007 level. Inflation rose in 2008 to about 10 percent due to higher
international commodity prices and a marked increase in public expenditure.
5.
The fiscal surplus remained at about 25 percent of GDP in 2008. Revenue
increased by 37 percent due to higher oil prices and enhanced tax administration. At the same

5
time, overall expenditure rose by 45 percent, reflecting large increases in both current and
capital outlays. Spending under the WDP was limited to LD 3.3 billion (about 3 percent of
GDP), compared to LD 4.6 billion approved in the budget.
6.
The external current account surplus remained high, at about 41 percent of
GDP in 2008. The rapid increase in imports of goods and services (30 percent) was more
than offset by a sharp rise in oil receipts, resulting in a further build up of the net foreign
assets of the CBL and the LIA to about $136 billion. The real effective exchange rate of the
dinar appreciated by about 6 percent in 2008, and averaged 8 percent in the twelve months to
March 2009.
7.
Broad money growth accelerated to about 48 percent in 2008, reflecting the rapid
increase in net foreign assets and in public expenditure, including on-lending by SCIs. Bank
credit to the economy increased by about 12.5 percent. Bank deposits rose by about
65 percent and mostly constituted of demand deposits of public entities. Interest rates
remained low and became largely negative in real terms with the rise in inflation.
8.
Bank restructuring and privatization continued to make progress. An asset
management company to deal with bad loans has been established, capital requirements are
being raised, and smaller banks are being encouraged to seek well-established foreign
strategic partners. The CBL licensed two new banks with foreign participation. In addition,
the authorities privatized 15 percent of one of the remaining two large public banks by
issuing an IPO.
9.
Commercial banks are well capitalized and profitable, but the quality of their
assets needs further improvement. Their overall capital adequacy ratio stood at about
16 percent at end-2008, and
profitability has been

II. OUTLOOK AND RISKS
10.
Real GDP growth is projected to decelerate to about 2 percent in 2009, mainly
reflecting an expected reduction in oil production by about 1.5 percent. However, the
maintenance of large public expenditure is expected to help sustain non-oil growth at around
6 percent. Inflation is projected to decelerate substantially in 2009 (to about 5 percent; it
averaged 5.2 percent in January–April) in line with the decline in international commodity
prices, and to moderate further over the medium term.
11.
The overall fiscal position is expected to register a surplus of about 10 percent of
GDP in 2009 despite the projected decline in oil revenue by almost 40 percent. This is due to
the projected small decline in public outlays after the very large increases in recent years.
The small decline in overall expenditure reflects a 20 percent reduction in capital spending
and a 25 percent increase in current outlays.
12.
In line with the above developments, the external current account surplus is
projected to narrow to about 17 percent of GDP in 2009. As a result of OPEC’s output
cuts and the sharp decline in oil prices, oil exports are expected to fall by about 40 percent.
Imports, on the other hand, are projected to increase by about 6 percent, broadly in line with
non-oil GDP growth. Net foreign assets of the CBL and the LIA will continue to increase, to
about $150 billion (equivalent to almost 250 percent of GDP) by end-2009.

13.
Libya’s economic growth and financial position are expected to strengthen over
the medium-term as a result of higher oil receipts projections, the upgrading of the
infrastructure, and continued interest of foreign investors. Oil production is envisaged to

over the medium-term, while the external
current account surplus is projected to
reach 27 percent.

14.
The medium-term outlook described above is subject to downside risks relating
to a further worsening in global economic conditions or a wavering of the efforts to improve
the quality of public expenditure and advance structural reforms. In particular, a more severe
global recession could lead to a further reduction in both oil and non-oil growth. The

8
prospects for inward foreign investment may also weaken. If these risks materialize,
economic growth, as well as the fiscal and external balances, would be lower than the above
projections. For example, a 20 percent reduction in oil prices relative to the baseline scenario
would lead to a reduction in the fiscal and current account surpluses by about 10 percentage
points of GDP.
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
15.
Against the above background, the policy discussions focused on the need to
enhance the quality of public expenditure and public finance management, address the
factors contributing to excess liquidity, and advance structural reforms.
A. Fiscal Policy
16.
Based on the 2009 budget, staff projects a small nominal decline in public
expenditure, putting an end to three years of large fiscal expansion. Current expenditure is
envisaged to increase by about 25 percent, compared to 2008, mostly on account of transfers
related to the Economic and Social Development Fund (ESDF) and a 16 percent projected
increase in the wage bill. The latter is due in large part to the return to the civil service
payroll of a portion of the public employees that were previously transferred to a central
labor office for retrenchment to the private sector. Apparent increases in other current outlays
mostly reflect improvements in classification and increased external grants to lower income
countries. On the other hand, capital outlays are projected to decline by about 20 percent,
consistent with the authorities’ policy to rationalize public investment.
17.
The authorities are taking steps to improve public financial management in line
with staff’s recommendations and the ongoing World Bank public expenditure review. In this
regard, the recent merging of the ministries of planning and finance is a welcome step which
will help enhance public expenditure planning, monitoring, and control. At the same time,
the 2009 budget allocated the equivalent of about 5 percent of GDP to public investment
funds outside the new ministry. The authorities believe that these funds fulfill specific
diversification needs and offer greater flexibility than the cumbersome budget expenditure
process. These funds are intended to strictly operate on a commercial basis and engage in
activities where the private sector has minor involvement. At the same time, the authorities
expressed their intention of streamlining the bank accounts of government entities.
18.
The authorities intend to continue to improve the LIA’s regulatory framework.
An LIA decree was issued in 2008, incorporating many of staff’s recommendations. While
the LIA continues to invest mostly abroad, some of its investments are being channeled to the
Libyan oil sector and to the LD 16 billion Libyan Development and Investment Fund, which
was established in March 2009 in partnership with the CBL and the private sector.

9
Box 1. Libya: Fiscal Sustainability Analysis
Staff updated the fiscal sustainability assessment to reflect oil price developments and the
authorities’ revised public expenditure plans. The analysis utilizes the permanent income
approach, which requires saving part of the oil wealth (in a stabilization fund or elsewhere) to
ensure intergenerational equity.
Based on this approach, at
current oil prices of $60-80 per
barrel, Libya’s expenditure
plans, as envisaged by the
Ministry of Planning and
Finance (MoPF), are
sustainable. The analysis
compares Libya’s expenditure
plans to the derived sustainable
levels at oil prices in the $40100 range. The results show that
Libya’s public expenditure plans
remain sustainable even if oil
prices decline to $60 per barrel
over the medium-term.

Box 2. Libya: Treasury Single Account: A Tool for Improving Public Finance
Management (PFM)
Some progress has been made in implementing the strategy recommended by staff in
2006 to strengthen PFM in Libya. Examples include the budget unification, improvements in
the budget classification, and the establishment of a macrofiscal unit. However, the MoPF
lacks centralized control over the government's cash resources. Considerable balances,
including from previous years’ budget allocations, lie idle for extended periods in the
numerous bank accounts of spending agencies. At the same time, the treasury often calls on the
CBL for advances to fund expenditure programs early in the fiscal year. Establishing a TSA
will help remedy these problems and improve expenditure control. A TSA would also facilitate
better fiscal and monetary policy coordination. TSA arrangements exist in neighboring
countries, including Algeria, Egypt, and Tunisia.
A TSA is typically held at the central bank although it can encompass several subaccounts,
which may be held at branches of the central bank or commercial banks. However, the balances
of such subaccounts would be cleared at the end of every day.
TSA arrangements could range from a very centralized structure to a completely
decentralized structure. Under a centralized model (such as in France, and some Francophone
African countries), requests for payments are prepared by individual budget agencies and sent
to a centralized Treasury, which controls them and plans their payment. This model has the
advantage of synergy between cash management on the one hand, and expenditure control and
transaction accounting on the other. Under the decentralized model (such as in Sweden and
some Anglo-Saxon countries), budget agencies process and make payments directly to
suppliers (and account for these transactions), but the payments are disbursed from the TSA.
This process is facilitated by electronic links between spending agencies, the central bank (or
commercial banks), and the Treasury. The Treasury sets the cash limits (monthly or quarterly)
for the total amount of payments that could be undertaken by a particular budget agency, but
does not control individual transactions. This model makes the spending agency responsible for
internal control and management, while maintaining central control of cash through the TSA.
Crucial steps are needed to facilitate the establishment of a TSA. Bank accounts of
government institutions should be closed and the legal basis for the TSA put in place. In
addition, an IT system should be installed connecting the spending entities, the Treasury, the
CBL, and commercial banks (if needed) in order to enable the making of payments and
settlement of subaccounts at the end of each day. Furthermore, it would be important to draw a
comprehensive chart of accounts and provide training to TSA users.

11
B. Monetary Policy and Financial Sector Reform
19.
In response to the moderate economic slowdown, the CBL reduced interest rate
on its discount facilities and CDs. The former was reduced by 100 basis points (to 4
percent) and the latter by 75 basis points (to 1.75 percent) in April 2009. Lending rates have
turned positive in 2009, with the decline in inflation.
20.
Progress is being made in enhancing the monetary policy framework. The CBL
introduced its own CDs, with Fund technical assistance in May 2008. These CDs are issued
on a weekly basis for a single maturity (91 days) at a fixed rate. Furthermore, the CBL is
undergoing a restructuring and modernization program, with Fund technical support, to
enhance its research, forecasting, and monetary policy implementation capabilities.
21.
However, structural factors are impeding the effectiveness of monetary policy
instruments. Most importantly, large
demand deposits of public entities

and on-lending of government funds

by SCIs have been contributing to a

liquidity overhang. These deposits
earn no interest and basically serve to

to various public entities. Banks

Therefore, the decisions underlying

this situation have very low
sensitivity to interest rates.
22.
The authorities are taking measures to contain SCIs’ lending by reducing their
funding from the state budget. The allocation for these institutions in the 2009 budget was
reduced to less than LD 1 billion, from about LD 1.5 billion in the 2008 budget. A diagnostic
study of the SCIs has been launched in order to guide the reform strategy. It is expected to be
completed later in 2009.
23.
Bank supervision continues to be strengthened, with Fund technical support.
Emphasis is being placed on: (i) enhancing off-site and on-site supervision procedures; (ii)
strengthening the skills of supervisors; (iii) improving supervisory reporting by banks to the
CBL; (iv) enhancing the calculation of prudential ratios and regulations; (v) strengthening
licensing procedures for banks and change in ownership structure; and (vi) improving IT
systems to facilitate effective supervision. Furthermore, a credit bureau has been established
recently, and a financial stability report will be produced soon.

Box 3. Libya: Reforming Specialized Credit Institutions
The scope of SCIs’ operations in Libya has
gone beyond international and regional
norms. The SCIs, which are basically
development banks, were established between
1970s and 1980s. They focused on providing
subsidized credit to residential real estate,
agriculture, and small enterprises. Since then,
their role has expanded substantially. Their share
in total outstanding credit increased from 13
percent in 2001 to almost 50 percent in 2007.
This is about 40 and 10 times more than their
relative size in Morocco and Tunisia,
respectively.

The SCIs have been crowding out commercial banks’
credit. The playing field is uneven due to the zero cost of
funding for SCIs and their lax lending standards and
minimal lending interest rates. As a result, SCIs’ share of
new credit increased from 17 percent in 2001 to 65
percent in 2007. This has impeded financial
intermediation by commercial banks, which remains low
by regional standards. Furthermore, through their onlending, SCIs indirectly contributed to a liquidity
overhang which reduces the effectiveness of monetary
policy instruments.

The process of reforming such institutions is often difficult. Converting them into commercial banks is not
an easy task. They typically lack the required expertise and potentially have a large amount of non-performing
loans. A credible strategy to reform SCIs should be based on the following key principles: (i) reducing the
scope and size of their operations; (ii) ensuring effective supervision by the CBL to preserve the financial
stability of the banking sector and safeguard public funds; (iii) strengthening corporate governance and
management of these institutions; and (iv) ensuring that SCIs are externally audited and comply with
international accounting standards.

13

C. External Sector Issues
24.
Staff’s econometric estimates indicate that the dinar’s real effective exchange
rate has shifted from a moderate undervaluation in 2008 to a moderate overvaluation in
2009, in line with developments in oil prices. These estimates, however, suffer from data and
methodological shortcomings and cannot accurately point to the appropriate level of the
equilibrium real effective exchange rate.
25.
The dinar’s peg to the SDR has served Libya well. This arrangement provides a
strong monetary anchor, while allowing some flexibility in the dinar’s exchange rate vis-àvis individual major currencies. Furthermore, the SDR offers the advantage of being a
transparent and straight-forward basket that is not vulnerable to pressure for change based on
short-term developments in Libya’s trading pattern.
D. Structural Reforms and Other Issues
26.
Progress has been made in customs and tax administration. Large tax payers
offices have been established and customs inspection is being automated. However, the
“service fee” on imports has been increased from 4 to 10 percent, and other ear-marked fees
remain in place. Furthermore, corporate tax is subject to many brackets, and can reach as
high as 45 percent.
27.
Some progress has been made in improving economic and financial statistics. In
this connection, a household budget survey was completed in 2008, a work program is being
implemented to establish a producer price index with Fund technical support. In addition,
concrete steps have been recently made to improve inter-agency cooperation on external
trade statistics, and monetary statistics are being enhanced. Further enhancing the
compilation and quality of data continues to be hampered by insufficient coordination
between different government agencies and staffing limitations.

14

Box 4. Libya: Exchange Rate Assessment
Staff’s econometric estimates suggest that the dinar real effective exchange rate has shifted from a
moderate undervaluation in 2008 to a moderate overvaluation in 2009. This is consistent with the
change in fundamentals in line with the decline in oil prices. However, the results, which utilize CGER
methodologies1/, are subject to significant data and methodological shortcoming, given the
predominance of oil exports in the Libyan economy.
The equilibrium real effective exchange rate (ERER)
methodology is not forward looking and can only
estimate the equilibrium rate at end-2008 when oil
prices where considerably higher than present prices.
The results point to a moderate undervaluation by 16
percent of the dinar in 2008, which is consistent with
past staff estimates.

The macroeconomic balance (MB) approach
indicates that Libya’s external current account
surplus projections are below their norm starting in
2009, implying an overvaluation of the exchange rate.
Based on a panel regression for oil-exporting countries, the
estimated current account norm for Libya is a surplus of
about 32 percent of GDP. This compares with a projected
surplus of about 27 percent over the medium term.

IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
28.
The impact of the global crisis on Libya has been limited thus far to the decline
in oil revenue. Notwithstanding that decline, the fiscal and external positions remain in
substantial surpluses and non-oil growth remained buoyant. This was largely due to prudent
macroeconomic policies and ongoing structural reforms.

15
29.
Staff welcomes the authorities’ overall fiscal stance, which strikes an
appropriate balance between short-and long-term considerations. The small decline in
public expenditure planned for 2009 is a clear break with the very large increases in recent
years, which have raised concerns about expenditure quality. At the same time, it reflects an
appropriate decision to avoid that the sharp decline in oil revenue translates into an abrupt
reduction in public expenditure, with adverse implications for domestic economic activity
and vital social and economic development programs.
30.
The authorities should focus on improving the quality and composition of
expenditure. In this connection, they are encouraged to reconsider the planned significant
increase in the wage bill in 2009. The return to the civil service payroll of a portion of the
large number of public employees that were being retrenched goes against the intention to
reduce the size of the government and to encourage the private sector.
31.
It is crucial to continue to advance the efforts to strengthen public finance
management. The recent merging of the ministries of finance and planning was a step in the
right direction. It would be important in the period ahead to improve the legal and
administrative framework governing the state budget, with a view to streamlining and
modernizing procedures. This would reduce the need for implementing investment programs
through funds outside the MoPF. While these funds offer greater flexibility than budgetary
expenditure, they increase the magnitude of quasi-fiscal operations. Furthermore, they can
become under pressure to deviate from their well-intended objectives. A proliferation of such
funds would complicate public expenditure management, increase the potential for losses and
price distortions, and crowd out the private sector. Strategic projects that are not sought by
the private sector should be implemented either through the state budget or in the context of
public-private partnerships with adequate safeguards.
32.
The staff welcomes the government’s intention to enhance its cash management
and expenditure control. Establishing a TSA would support this effort, and also facilitate
fiscal and monetary policy coordination. Staff stands ready to provide detailed technical
advice in support of establishing a TSA, enhancing the classification of expenditure, and
casting the annual state budget within a medium-term framework.
33.
The mission welcomes the decision to postpone the implementation of the WDP.
Staff recommends that if the WDP program goes forward, it should be limited in scope and
replace, to the extent possible, existing subsidies with more efficient well-targeted transfers.
34.
The transparent start of the LIA in 2007 was encouraging. It would be important
to continue to enhance the LIA’s operational and legal framework. In this connection, to best
serve its core objectives, the focus of the LIA should be on conservative investments abroad
on a commercial basis.
35.
The introduction of CBL’s CDs in May 2008 has been an important step toward
enhancing the monetary policy framework. The staff supports the authorities’ plans to

16
extend the range of the CDs maturities, especially for shorter maturities, and develop an
auction mechanism for them. Ongoing efforts to modernize the CBL and enhance the
payments system would also help lay down the infrastructure to support the design,
implementation, and effectiveness of monetary policy.
36.
It is crucial to address the factors behind the large excess liquidity in the
banking system in order to increase the effectiveness of monetary policy tools. In
particular, priority should be accorded to establishing the TSA and reducing on-lending by
SCIs.
37.
Staff welcomes the ongoing efforts to strengthen bank supervision. Further efforts
are, however, needed to (i) enhance supervisory reporting; (ii) improve on-site supervision
techniques to make them more effective and risk-focused; and (iii) continue to improve
regulations and standards.
38.
The dinar’s peg to the SDR continues to serve the economy well. This
arrangement provides a strong monetary anchor, while allowing some flexibility in the
dinar’s exchange rate vis-à-vis individual major currencies. The dinar appears to be
moderately overvalued, but this is likely to be partly transitory in view of the projected
decline in the current account surplus toward its medium term norm. Furthermore, the
apparent moderate overvaluation is based on econometric estimates that suffer from serious
data and methodological shortcomings, and are thus not reliable.
39.
Staff encourages the authorities to further advance structural reforms. In this
connection, the progress made in customs and tax administration is welcome. Furthermore,
the recent decision to streamline customs exemptions is a move in the right direction.
However, it would be important to adopt low income and corporate tax and customs rates,
with very few brackets and limited exemptions. In addition, it would be useful to modernize
the tax system, with a view to gradually moving to self-assessment and risk-based auditing. It
would also be important to further enhance the regulatory framework in order to improve the
business climate. These reforms would support private sector growth, diversification, and the
creation of viable employment opportunities.
40.
While data provision is adequate for surveillance, the authorities are encouraged
to continue to improve economic and financial statistics in order to facilitate better
monitoring and analysis of developments to guide policy formulation.
41.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Libya take place on the
standard 12-month cycle.

LD 1 = SDR 0.5175. From February 14, 1999 to December 31, 2001, a dual exchange rate
system was in place, with an “official” exchange rate pegged to the SDR, and a “special”
exchange rate pegged to the U.S. dollar.
VIII.

Exchange System:

In June 2003, the authorities eliminated the restrictions that gave rise to multiple currency
practices. Libya accepted its obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2(a), 3, and 4 of the
Articles of Agreement in June 2003.

ANNEX II. LIBYA: RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
Prepared by the World Bank staff
(As of July 10, 2009)
1.
Libya has been a member of the World Bank Group since 1958, joining the
International Bank of Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and International Finance
Corporation (IFC) in September 1958, International Development Association (IDA) in
August 1961, and Multilateral International Guarantee Association (MIGA) in April 1993.
There have been no World Bank Group loans made to Libya to date as the development of
the country’s petroleum assets from 1960 placed Libya among capital-surplus oil-producing
countries, and provided resources to build extensive infrastructure and provide social
services.
2.
In 2007, a Technical Cooperation Agreement was signed between the Bank and the
Government of Libya, with a total budget of $1 million contributed jointly by the two parties.
The Agreement funds a Joint Economic Advisory Program, geared to support and further
Libya’s reform process, covering the period of July 1, 2007 to June 30, 2008. Activities were
launched in the areas of an Investment Climate Assessment, Business and Legal
Environment, and support for the development of the Libya Vision 2025. A Public
Expenditure Review (PER) was also launched in August 2007, with the main mission taking
place in November 2007. Completion of the first draft of the document took place in
October 2008. Then, a high level seminar, attended by the entire Economic and Social
Cabinet took place in December 2008. After introducing written comments from all
ministries and entities, the final version of the PER was delivered to the Authorities in April
2009 for their final clearance. The PER benefits from multiple inputs by IMF staff. The IMF
also had active participation in the December 2008 high level seminar.
3.
Two other high-level workshops were held in 2008. The first one was on “Libya in
Transition.” It covered the economic strategy, oil revenue management and social transfers.
The second was on “Topics of Private Sector Development” and had an active participation
from the private sector.
4.
A Bank mission took place in March 2008 to introduce the new Director of the
Maghreb Department to the Libyan authorities, and to discuss the future work program with
the country. The authorities communicated their desire to proceed with many of the
recommendations derived from the PER work, but that it should take into account recent
developments (the March 2, 2008 decision to reorganize the government).
5.
Several activities are ongoing during CY2009: a) completion of the Public
Expenditure Review; b) TA support on WTO accession, review of business regulations, and
preparation of an Investment Climate Assessment; c) review and update of the 2007–2008
Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), with the new MOU covering the period 2009-11;
and d) work on a new area providing TA on statistical capacity building and surveys.

ANNEX III. LIBYA: STATISTICAL ISSUES
As of July 10, 2009
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. Weaknesses remain
in (i) the conceptual and compilation procedures underpinning the collection of statistics in the various sectors;
(ii) deficiencies in coverage, periodicity, and timeliness; (iii) lack of consistency of data across sectors; and
(iv) with the exception of monetary data, lack of a reporting system to facilitate updating MCD’s operational
database between missions. These issues are compounded by institutional weaknesses, the lack of interagency
cooperation, the proliferation of agencies with unclear and often overlapping responsibilities, and unclear
demarcation of responsibilities between agencies.
In 2005 a multisector mission examined the conceptual and compilation procedures for national accounts, price
indices, foreign trade, money and banking, and government finance statistics. It developed recommendations for
improvement in these systems, and encouraged Libya to join the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS).
Libya could benefit from participation in the GDDS as a framework to improve its macroeconomic statistics
and coordination among the institutions that compile them.

National Accounts: Some progress has been made in the compilation of GDP statistics by economic activity
through 2004, based on the 1968 System of National Accounts. However, the compilation process is hampered
by high staff turnover and significant delays in the receipt of basic data from various sources, particularly other
government agencies. In addition, many of the surveys are outdated. Annual data up to 2002 were reported to
STA in 2004 and published in the International Financial Statistics (IFS); however, the estimates are not fully
consistent with other data sets. A new household survey was finalized in 2003.
To improve the national accounts, the 2005 STA mission made several recommendations including: (i)
establishing a National Statistical Agency to produce and disseminate official statistics and coordinate the
national statistical program; (ii) creating a National Statistical Council as a legally empowered interagency
coordination committee to oversee compilation of national accounts statistics; (iii) transferring responsibility for
the national accounts from the National Planning Council to the Census and Statistical Department of the
National Information and Documentation Agency (NIDA) and creating 6–10 additional permanent staff
positions; (iv) prioritizing implementation of the 1993 System of National Accounts and outlining entailed data
requirements; (v) improving the questionnaires used for the construction and manufacturing surveys; (vi)
initiating regular surveys of major services, agricultural output, and public and private construction; and (vii)
improving estimates for transport, storage, and communication companies.
STA appointed a resident national accounts statistics advisor to assist in implementing STA recommendations
in particular, and to improve the national accounts in general. The assignment, which began in June 2006, was
for one year and renewed for another year upon the request of the authorities. The advisor focused on
identifying new data sources and establishing a system to collect the necessary data. He also coordinated the
formation of several technical committees to guarantee that the data obtained by national accounts compilers are
consistent with the data compiled by other agencies. The advisor concluded his work in June 2008 and the
authorities produced revised national accounts statistics.
Price statistics: The consumer price index (CPI) is based on weights derived from the 1992–93 household
budget survey, covers only Tripoli, has 1999 as reference year, and is compiled from 2000 onwards. A new
index based on a 2003 household budget survey is compiled since 2007. Both of these indices are available with
a one-month lag and published on the Central Bank of Libya (CBL) website. A new household expenditure
survey is being conducted between November 2007 and October 2008. The expenditure data will be used to
update the CPI and further expand its geographic coverage to include eight urban and rural areas. The official
index is now based on the 2003 household survey. An updated and expanded CPI with weights derived from the
2008 household budget survey is planned to be released in January 2010. Furthermore, a producer price index

28
(PPI) is being established in collaboration with STA and is expected to be released in 2010.
Government finance statistics: The fiscal information system remains fragmented and inconsistent with
international standards in many aspects, since it was designed for administrative reporting under the
government finance law, rather than for purposes of providing timely statistical information for economic
planning and analysis.
To improve the fiscal data, the 2005 STA mission recommended: (i) adopting centralized management of all
budgetary central government accounts at the ministry of finance; (ii) expanding coverage of central
government accounts by including extra budgetary and local government operations; (iii) developing GFS
metadata on concepts, scope, classifications, basis of recording, data sources, and statistical techniques for
posting on the GDDS website; (iv) adopting the Fund’s 2001 Government Finance Statistics Manual (GFSM)
as a coherent methodological framework for the production and dissemination of monthly, quarterly, and annual
fiscal data. This would promote the recording of all assets and liabilities on accrual basis and at market values.
To this end, STA has trained two CBL staff, one in 2007 and one in 2008.
Monetary statistics: While the timeliness and quality of monetary data reported for IFS have improved
significantly, some methodological deficiencies remain. To enhance monetary and financial statistics, the STA
missions in 2005 and 2007 made the following recommendations: (i) reclassify Libyan Foreign Bank (LFB) as a
resident financial institution under other depository corporations and include LFB in the institutional coverage
of the monetary survey; (ii) adopt market-based valuation of financial instruments and accrual accounting
procedures for adding accruing interest to the outstanding amount of the instrument; (iii) revalue CBL’s
holdings of monetary gold at end-period market prices; (iv) identify all Fund-related accounts in the CBL’s
balance sheet as per IMF Finance Department guidelines; (v) if specialized credit institutions start issuing
deposit liabilities, reclassify these institutions as other depository corporations and include them in the
institutional coverage of the monetary survey; and (vi) revise/develop report forms for banks that would contain
a breakdown of positions by currency of denomination, financial instrument, residency, and economic sector of
counterparty consistent with the structure of the Standardized Report Forms. The CBL is currently in the
process of improving classification and revising the monetary survey.
Balance of payments: Since 2000 annual balance of payments data have been regularly reported to STA in the
BPM5 format. As part of the Middle East Regional Technical Assistance Center’s (METAC) work program, a
long-term Regional Statistics Advisor (RSA) was appointed to help strengthen external sector statistics and to
provide assistance either directly or through backstopping short-term experts. The main objective is to set up a
compilation program for quarterly balance of payments statistics and for international investment position
statistics by the end of 2009.
The METAC mission that visited Tripoli in 2008 found that the implementation of most recommendations was
pending. The majority of the surveys of the nonbank sector and the recommendation on the interagency
committee on foreign trade statistics are yet to be implemented. The need for the National Oil Company (NOC)
to provide more detailed information on its import/export transactions, and for customs to address recording
issues on the customs declarations forms are among the critical recommendations that require decisive action.
While recognizing the importance of introducing provisions in the Bank Law for mandatory reporting by all
resident sectors of data needed for compilation of balance of payments, and for increasing staff resources for
balance of payments compilation, the mission noted that the current staff was equipped with the basic skills for
implementing the work program agreed with METAC.
To further improve the balance of payments statistics, the 2009 RSA mission made the following
recommendations: (i) continue increasing resources; (ii) institutionalize regular coordination meetings of the
CBL with the General Authority of Information, and the Customs Authority to ensure consistency of external
trade data among all agencies; (iii) ensure that transactions of the central bank and transactions on behalf of the
Government are entered into the balance of payments statement based on the source data instead of the
currently employed ad-hoc estimates; (iv) apply the internationally accepted standards in defining residency of
the Libyan Foreign Bank. In addition, balance of payments data for 2002-2007 have been reviewed and
adjustments were made where needed. The mission commended the authorities for their interest in participating
in the Coordinated Direct Investment Survey, but expressed concern over the delay in external trade data and

29
the fact that the committee for reviewing the foreign trade statistics constituted by the General Secretariat of the
Popular Committee ceased to exist.
International Investment Position (IIP): Data on official reserves are available on the central bank’s website
and in the balance sheet of the Libyan Investment Authority. However, data on government’s external debt and
lending are incomplete and the compilation of a comprehensive IIP is also hindered by the lack of reliable
information on the corporate and household sectors’ net foreign position. The authorities are enhancing capacity
to overcome these shortcomings.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2009 Article IV Consultation with
theSocialist People’s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya
On August 5, 2009, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with the Socialist People’s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya.1
Background
Libya’s overall macroeconomic performance in 2008 was strong. Real GDP grew by about
3.8 percent in 2008. However, non-oil growth was broad-based and estimated at 8 percent.
Oil output increased slightly at the first three quarters of the year then declined in the last
quarter in line with OPEC’s decision to reduce quotas. As a result, production for the year
as a whole was similar to its 2007 level. Inflation rose in 2008 to about 10 percent due to
higher international commodity prices and a marked increase in public expenditure.
The fiscal surplus remained at about 25 percent of GDP in 2008. Revenue increased by
about 37 percent due to higher oil prices and enhanced tax administration. At the same
time, overall expenditure rose by an estimated 45 percent, reflecting large increases in both
current and capital outlays. Spending under the Wealth Distribution Program (WDP) was
limited to LD 3.3 billion (equivalent to about 3 percent of GDP), compared to LD 4.6 billion
approved in the budget

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by
the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman
of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to
the country's authorities. This PIN summarizes the views of the Executive Board as expressed
during the August 5, 2009 Executive Board discussion based on the staff report.

32
The 2009 budget envisages a small nominal decline in public expenditure, putting an end to
three years of large fiscal expansion. The small decline in overall expenditure reflects a 20
percent reduction in capital spending and a 25 percent increase in current outlays, which
includes a 16 percent projected increase in the wage bill. The latter is due in large part to
the return to the civil service payroll of a portion of the public employees that were
previously transferred to a central labor office for retrenchment to the private sector. The
overall fiscal position is expected to register a surplus of about 10 percent of GDP in 2009
despite the projected decline in oil revenue by almost 40 percent.
The external current account surplus remained high at about 41 percent of GDP in 2008.
The rapid increase in imports (about 30 percent) was more than offset by a sharp rise in oil
receipts, resulting in a further build up of the net foreign assets of the Central Bank of Libya
(CBL) and the Libyan Investment Authority (LIA) to about $136 billion.
Broad money growth accelerated to about 48 percent in 2008, reflecting the substantial
increase in net foreign assets and the rapid increase in public expenditure, including onlending by the SCIs. The latter accounted for almost 50 percent of outstanding credit. Bank
credit to the economy increased by about 12.5 percent. Bank deposits rose by about
65 percent. They mostly constitute of demand deposits of public entities.
Bank restructuring and privatization are making progress. An asset management company
to deal with bad loans has been established, capital requirements are being raised, and
smaller banks are being encouraged to seek well-established foreign strategic partners. The
CBL licensed two new banks with foreign participation. In addition, the authorities privatized
15 percent of one of the remaining two large public banks by issuing an IPO.
Progress has been made in customs and tax administration. Large tax payers offices have
been established and customs inspection is being automated. However, the “service fee” on
imports has been increased from 4 to 10 percent, and other ear-marked fees remain in
place.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed Libya’s solid macroeconomic performance and the important
progress in implementing structural reforms, particularly in the financial sector. The impact
of the global crisis on Libya has been limited to declines in oil revenue, and non-oil growth
has remained buoyant. Libya’s medium-term outlook continues to be favorable. Directors
underscored the importance of further efforts to address excess liquidity, improve public
financial management, and advance structural reforms that would support the authorities’
aim to diversify the economy away from oil and promote the role of the private sector.
Directors noted that the authorities’ overall fiscal stance strikes an appropriate balance
between short- and long-term considerations, and that the small decline in public
expenditure planned for 2009 is a clear break with the large increases in recent years. They

33
encouraged stronger efforts to improve the quality and composition of expenditure, and limit
the growth of current expenditure. Directors welcomed the authorities’ decision to postpone
the implementation of the Wealth Distribution Program.
Directors considered it crucial to advance the efforts to strengthen public financial
management. The recent merging of the ministries of finance and planning is an important
step in this direction. Directors endorsed the government’s intention to establish a Treasury
Single Account to enhance cash management and expenditure control and to improve
coordination of fiscal and monetary policies. Going forward, modernizing the budget’s legal
and administrative framework to reduce extra-budgetary funds would enhance budget
transparency and effectiveness. Directors encouraged the authorities to continue to
enhance the legal and operational framework of the Libyan Investment Authority. To best
serve its core objectives, the focus should be on conservative investments abroad.
Directors welcomed the intention of the Central Bank of Libya (CBL) to extend the maturities
range of its certificates of deposit and develop an auction mechanism for them. The ongoing
efforts to modernize the CBL and enhance the payments system will establish the
infrastructure to support the design and implementation of monetary policy. To address
large excess liquidity in the banking system, priority should be accorded to establishing
quickly the Treasury Single Account and reducing on-lending by specialized credit
institutions.
Directors commended the advances made in bank privatization and restructuring. In
particular, they welcomed the recent establishment of an asset management company to
deal with bad loans, and the partial privatization of the largest public bank. Directors
welcomed the ongoing efforts to further enhance supervisory reporting, on-site supervision
techniques, and regulations and standards.
Directors agreed that the dinar’s peg to the SDR continues to serve Libya well. They noted
that, while the dinar appears to be moderately overvalued, this is likely to be partly transitory
in view of the projected decline in the external current account surplus.
Directors recognized the considerable progress achieved in liberalizing and opening the
economy, supported by Fund technical assistance. They encouraged continued efforts to
enhance the regulatory framework in order to further improve the business climate and
promote private sector activity. The welcome strengthening in customs and tax
administration needs to be accompanied by low corporate tax and customs rates, with few
brackets and limited exemptions.
Directors encouraged the authorities to continue to improve economic and financial
statistics.

Statement by Mr. Shaalan on The Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya
Executive Board Meeting 09/85
August 5, 2009

1.
Libya is implementing a comprehensive reform program driven by the Government’s
decision to move away from an ownership role in the economy to that of a prudent regulator.
The entire economy is undergoing a restructuring, underpinned by widespread public
support. The reform program—supported by technical assistance from international
institutions, in particular the IMF—aims to diversify the economy away from oil and to
promote the role of the private sector. Reflecting the shift in economic policies, a private
investment boom is evident and the private sector’s share in the economy is growing.
Recent Developments and Outlook
2.
Prudent macro-economic and foreign exchange reserve management has shielded the
economy from the recent global financial market turmoil. Real GDP grew at about 4 percent
in 2008, reflecting stable oil production and robust growth in the non-oil sector. Non-oil
growth was broad-based and estimated at around 8 percent of GDP, benefiting from
normalization of international relations and heightened foreign investor interest in the
banking, services, infrastructure and hydrocarbon sectors. Inflation, which had peaked in
2008 on account of rising imported commodity prices, receded to 3.2 percent (y-o-y) at endMay 2009. Net foreign assets increased from $54 billion in 2005 to $139 billion at end-June
2009, providing a comfortable reserve cover of 22 months of imports. Consistent with this
strong external position, Libya has resumed participation in the Fund’s Financial
Transactions Plan for the first time since 1981.
3.
The impact of the global crisis on Libya’s economy has been limited to a reduction in
the sizeable current account and budget surpluses of recent years, while the banking sector
remains unaffected. The current account surplus will likely be half of its average size of 40
percent of GDP over the past four years as international oil prices and domestic production
levels decline. Similarly, the fiscal surplus will decline from an average of 25-30 percent of
GDP over the past four years to about 10 percent of GDP in 2009. While overall GDP growth
may drop to 2 percent, non-oil growth is expected to only moderately decline to 6 percent in
2009 and to subsequently return to the range of 7-8 percent, driven by both public and private
sectors investments.
Fiscal Developments and Policies
4.
The fiscal stance strikes an appropriate balance between short-term and long-term
considerations and it is in line with the absorptive capacity of the economy. The 2009 budget
was prepared on the basis of an oil price of $45 per barrel and will register a large surplus in
the event that current oil prices persist. A modest nominal increase in current expenditure is

37
planned; a 14 percent increase in the wage bill reflects the reclassification of some budgetary
categories as no civil service wage increases were granted in 2009. Capital expenditure is to
be significantly reduced by about one quarter from its 2008 levels consistent with the
authorities’ policy to rationalize public investment. With the establishment of the Libyan
Investment Authority, budgetary expenditure in future years will continue to be consistent
with the authorities’ projections of medium-term fiscal sustainability.
5.
Public financial management continues to be strengthened. To improve planning,
monitoring and control, the Ministries of Planning and Finance have been merged and a
decision has been taken to move to a Treasury Single Account (TSA) at the Central Bank of
Libya (CBL). The new investment fund established in March 2009 will operate on purely
commercial basis with the aim of crowding in the private sector by focusing on publicprivate partnerships and investing in sectors where the private sector has not yet been active.
A decree was issued in 2008 to establish a sound regulatory framework for the Libyan
Investment Authority, most of whose resources are invested abroad.
Monetary Developments and Policies
6.
Monetary policy has been anchored by the dinar’s peg to the SDR, and it has been
primarily geared toward managing excess liquidity to ensure price stability. Rising public
sector spending contributed to broad money growth of 48 percent in 2008. Bank deposits
rose by about 50 percent, but bank credit to the economy expanded by only 12½ percent,
mainly because substantial funds, obtained from budgetary transfers, are channeled through
the public specialized credit institutions. Credit extended by these institutions has expanded
by 30 percent in 2008, following a 60 percent annual increase in the previous three years.
Lending by the specialized credit institutions and the large public deposits in commercial
banks have posed a challenge for monetary policy management.
7.
To help absorb the large liquidity overhang in banks, central bank certificates of
deposit (CDs) were introduced in May 2008, and the authorities plan to expand the use of
CDs, especially by offering a range of shorter maturities and to develop an auction
mechanism for these CDs. When inflation subsided in 2009, the CBL reduced the rate on
CDs by 50 basis points to 1.75 percent, along with reducing the rate on its discount facilities
by 100 basis points (to 4 percent). With these declines, lending rates, currently about 6.5
percent, turned positive in 2009. In addition to improving the management of government
deposits and payments, the planned move to a TSA and the reduction in budgetary allocation
to specialized credit institutions in 2009 should lead to a significant reduction in excess
liquidity in the system. Interbank and secondary markets will be developed after a settlement
system for securities is introduced.
Financial Sector Developments and Policies
8.
As earlier indicated, the banking system has been shielded from the impact of the
global financial crisis. Domestic banks had no exposure to foreign risky assets. Commercial

38
bank profitability is increasing, partly reflecting interest on holdings at the central bank, and
they are well capitalized, with overall capital adequacy at 16 percent. Although the ratio of
nonperforming loans is relatively high compared with neighboring countries, at around 20
percent, it has steadily declined from 32 percent in 2005. An asset management company has
been established to deal with bad loans and minimum capital requirements are being raised.
As part of a bank restructuring and privatization program, private banks have been
encouraged to find foreign strategic partners and two public banks have been privatized. In
addition, a comprehensive study has been prepared to reform the specialized credit
institutions.
9.
A broad ranging program is under way to modernize the central bank that
encompasses upgrading of the monetary policy framework, establishing a functional-based
organizational structure, and strengthening bank supervision. The program includes reforms
aimed at enhancing research, forecasting, and monetary policy implementation capabilities
through modern human resource management and a new compensation system. In addition,
measures are being implemented to enhance the operation of the payment system to
strengthen the infrastructure for more effective monetary policy implementation. Supervision
is being enhanced through improving regulations in line with international standards,
enhancing bank reporting, strengthening skills, and on-site and off-site supervisory
procedures. Work is under way to produce a financial stability report. Moreover, a credit
bureau has been established.
Structural Reforms for Sustained Growth
10.
Considerable progress has been made in liberalizing and opening the economy,
including implementing a comprehensive privatization program of state enterprises,
simplifying procedures for business applications, removing customs duties, liberalizing all
prices (except for wheat, rice, and flour that are sold in cooperatives), removing restrictions
on external trade, and allowing foreign investment in key sectors. More than a dozen new
laws have been passed including property, wage, tax, investment, and competition laws.
11.
The economy has been opened to both foreign and domestic private investment.
These investments are taking place in the banking, hydrocarbon, real estate, tourism and
transportation sectors. Also, thousands of small privately owned retail shops have opened.
The private sector share in the economy is increasing and growth in the economy is mainly
coming from the non-oil economy. Underpinning these changes, is a commitment to these
reforms with the aim of maintaining and enhancing social justice and expanding prosperity
for all its citizens.
12.
The newly established Wealth Distribution Program (WDP) aims to share the oil
wealth by providing citizens funds to purchase directly from the market certain services
(such as health and education) that are currently being provided by the public sector. The
intention was to facilitate a shift in the provision of services from the public to the private

39
sector. After in depth debates in the regional parliaments last February, however, a decision
was taken to place the program on hold pending further more detailed study.
