STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
Context. Latvia has made remarkable economic progress since the crisis: the output gap
is now largely closed, the current account deficit has been reduced to sustainable levels,
and unemployment continues to fall. However, the economy has recently slowed
considerably in the face of a deteriorating external environment, weak investment, and
persistently shrinking bank credit.
Challenges. Subdued economic growth is expected to continue in 2015 due to
continued weakness in trade partners, particularly Russia. An escalation of geo-political
tensions or protracted low growth in the Euro Area poses further downside risks. Rapid
productivity growth will be needed over the medium term if per capita income is to
converge to core Euro Area levels.
Staff views.


The continued contraction of bank credit is likely to constrain investment going
forward. Recent efforts to catalyze SME lending and improve the implementation of
insolvency procedures are welcome.



Over the medium term efforts are needed to increase the revenue envelope to
ensure that necessary capital and social expenditures can be accommodated.



Although geopolitical tensions do not appear to have significantly affected the
inflow of non-resident deposits (NRDs) to date, continued vigilant supervision and
regulation of the NRD banking sector is needed.



Structural reforms are needed in several areas—such as education, infrastructure,
labor markets and the judicial system—to maintain competitiveness over time in the
Euro Area currency union.

Authorities’ views. The authorities were in broad agreement with staff
recommendations, notwithstanding some differences on tax and benefit policies. They
agreed to explore ways to build fiscal space over the medium-term to accommodate
essential expenditures. They also concurred with the need for higher prudential
standards and intensive monitoring of risks associated with NRD banking sector.

Law (FDL); measures to reduce inequality and strengthen
the social safety net; structural reforms to boost productivity; and close supervision of non-resident
deposits (NRDs) in the banking system. Policy making has broadly reflected these recommendations.
Fiscal policy has been in line with the FDL, and some measures, such as raising the minimum nontaxable allowance under the income tax, have targeted vulnerable sections of society. The electricity
sector has been liberalized, and close supervision of NRD-specialized banks continues.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
3.
The recovery slowed considerably in 2014 amid a deteriorating external environment.
GDP growth fell from 4.2 percent in 2013 to an estimated 2.4 percent, reflecting the prolonged
closure of a large steel manufacturer Liepajas Metalurgs (LM), and weak economic performance in
the Euro Area (EA) and Russia amid rising geopolitical tensions. Despite the decline, the GDP growth
rate remained well above the Euro Area average of 0.9 percent. To date the direct impact of the
Russia-Ukraine conflict, including sanctions, is estimated to be relatively small (Box 1). However, the
conflict—together with the lingering economic malaise in the Euro Area—has raised uncertainty and
likely been a key factor in holding back domestic demand.
4.
Consumption growth decelerated strongly, and the anticipated investment recovery
was modest. Private consumption growth was only 2.3 percent in 2014, much lower than
6.3 percent in 2013, as the uncertain economic climate led to more precautionary savings. Gross
fixed investment increased by a sluggish 1.6 percent, belying expectations of a strong rebound from
the 5.2 percent contraction of 2013. Apart from weak external conditions, controversy over

4

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF LATVIA

proposed amendments to the insolvency law likely contributed to an uncertain domestic
environment. Exports remained subdued due to tepid growth among trading partners and the fullyear impact of the closure of LM in mid-2013, while the depreciation of the ruble against the euro
had a negative impact on export receipts, especially in the last quarter. The current account deficit
widened slightly to about 3 percent of GDP.
5.
The labor market continued to tighten. Real wages increased 6.3 percent and the
increases were broad-based, resulting from both a higher minimum wage (320 euros per month, up
from the previous level of 280 euros) and competition for higher skilled workers. It is unlikely that
the rapid wage growth signals an overheating labor market at this juncture: few companies reported
labor shortages as an important obstacle to businesses, and part of the recorded wage increase
probably reflects successful tax compliance measures, which have led to more accurate reporting
and reduced under-the-table “envelope wages”. The unemployment rate declined further to about
10.5 percent in December 2014, down from 11.3 percent a year ago, while the participation rate
stayed constant.
6.
Inflation recovered slightly on the back of robust core inflation. Headline inflation
averaged only 0.7 percent, following zero price growth the previous year. Despite a significant
increase in core inflation to 1.5 percent (from 0.2 percent the previous year), reflecting strong wage
growth, the continued decline in food and energy prices held back headline inflation. In comparison,
core inflation in the Euro Area was 0.7 percent in 2014.
7.
Banks continued to repair their balance sheets. Bank profitability improved further, while
the overall NPL ratio declined to 6.8 percent in December 2014 from 8.3 percent a year earlier.
However, deleveraging continues, with the stock of bank credit to the private sector declining by
about 7.6 percent (y-on-y) in December 2014. Moreover, the issuance of new loans actually
decreased in 2014. The shrinking stock of domestic credit—extended primarily by large Nordic
subsidiary banks—was matched by the repatriation of funds to parent banks. Asset prices continued
their gradual recovery (Figure 6), although both stock prices and property prices remain well under
the levels reached just prior to the financial crisis.
8.
There is little evidence that geopolitical tensions have disrupted the flow of NRDs into
Latvia. NRD growth was stable in 2014 and accelerated slightly towards the end of the year.
Excluding exchange rate effects, which were substantial due to the depreciation of the euro against
the US dollar, the stock of NRDs increased by 14 percent year-on-year in December 2014, broadly in
line with the average rate of growth over the last three years.
9.
The general government deficit widened by about ½ percentage point to around
1.4 percent of GDP in 2014. While this exceeded the nominal budget target of 0.9 percent of GDP,
the breach was largely accounted for by a one-off payment related to the sale of Citadele bank (see
below). The negative budgetary impact of the economic slowdown was largely offset by revenue
gains from improved tax compliance and higher wages. With the output gap still negative, staff
estimate that the structural deficit, excluding the one-off cost, remains just under 1 percent of GDP.

REPUBLIC OF LATVIA

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
10.
Lackluster economic growth is expected to continue this year. This reflects the adverse
impact of the anemic external environment, particularly Russia’s sharp slowdown, on exports and
investment. This will be mitigated but not fully offset by higher disposable income due to lower oil
prices and robust real wages, which would tend to support private consumption. LM has now
reopened and is gradually ramping-up production, but is not expected to reach full capacity until
the fourth quarter. Given abundant liquidity in the banking system, the accommodative monetary
stance of the ECB is unlikely to exercise much impact except through a weaker euro and
expectations of a more robust recovery in the Euro Area. While inflation is expected to fall in 2015,
reflecting the sharply lower oil price forecast, the liberalization of electricity tariffs will support prices
to some extent.1
11.
Over time, growth is expected to accelerate as the external climate improves and
investment picks-up, but this is predicated on strong reform efforts. Annual medium-term
growth of around 4 percent—higher than in core economies—should be achievable as the economy
converges towards Euro Area average income levels. This is conditional on measures to enhance
competitiveness, and continued prudent macroeconomic management. Adverse demographics,
including continuing emigration, will tend to reduce the labor force, so reforms aimed at reducing
high structural unemployment will be needed simply to keep employment constant. Robust growth
will depend on capital accumulation—underpinned by a resumption of credit supply—and TFP
growth (see selected issues paper on Latvia’s medium-term growth). International evidence shows
that while several countries at a similar level of development have been able to increase labor
productivity rapidly and converge towards frontier income levels, others have failed to do so: the
key is to attract sufficient investment, especially in industries with high investment multipliers, and
lay the foundations for rapidly improving productivity, including by building infrastructure and
through reforms to education.
12.
The outlook is subject to significant downside risks (RAM). A prolonged slowdown in
Russia and the Euro Area would further dampen confidence and thwart a pick-up in economic
activity, while a further escalation of sanctions and counter-sanctions could disrupt trade
settlements. A sharp supply-driven rise in oil prices would remove an important factor supporting
projected growth, especially in the near-term. Resurgent sovereign stress arising from events in
Greece could spill over to higher bond yields in Latvia. A failure to tackle the structural reform
agenda would impede productivity growth and diminish competitiveness over the medium term;
indeed the external assessment (Box 2) shows that there are already some signs of eroding
competitiveness due to recently rising unit labor costs (although so far these losses are minor
1

From January 1st, 2015, smaller enterprises and households—which had hitherto bought electricity from the stateowned JSC Latvenergo at subsidized rates—shifted to purchasing electricity on the free market (with some
exemptions for special groups such as poor households or households with many children). This reform—long
advocated by the European commission—was originally scheduled for April, 2014 but was delayed to develop a
proper compensation mechanism for low income households.

compared to the gains made from internal devaluation since the crisis). The external assessment also
shows that Latvia is vulnerable to a severe growth or current account shock, which could reverse the
projected medium-term trend of a gradually falling debt-to-GDP ratio. The authorities broadly
concurred with these risks, but noted that while sovereign stress arising in the European periphery
might increase somewhat the cost of the government’s external financing from the current
extremely low rates, Latvia’s low public debt and sound macroeconomic fundamentals make it very
unlikely to be rationed from credit markets. Indeed, ratings agencies have repeatedly upgraded the
country’s sovereign rating over the last three years. The authorities also noted that—partly as a
result of the ECB’s unconventional policy actions—there were upside risks from a stronger-thanexpected recovery in the Euro Area.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Fiscal Policy
13.
The 2015 budget is broadly neutral. A 1 percentage point cut in the personal income tax
(PIT) rate to 23 percent, which will result in an estimated revenue loss of ¼ percent of GDP, is
expected to be offset by growth of the tax base, as tax compliance continues to improve and wages
rise (including through a further 40 euros increase in the minimum wage), and by a cut in capital
spending. The structural deficit target of 1 percent of GDP is in line with the authorities’ Fiscal
Discipline Law (FDL), and strikes an appropriate balance between the need to rebuild fiscal space
over the cycle and that of avoiding fiscal drag in a weak economic environment.2 The authorities
agreed with staff that, given the unusually large uncertainties regarding external conditions, the
budget should be implemented flexibly in accordance with the FDL. Automatic stabilizers should be
allowed to operate fully in case economic growth falls below the forecast.
14.
Staff urged further measures targeted at reducing inequality and strengthening the
social safety net. At less than one fifth the EU average (per inhabitant) social protection benefits in
Latvia remain among the lowest in Europe. At the same time, income inequality (as reflected for
instance in the ratio of the highest to the lowest income quintile) is among the highest. The
authorities have recently taken some measures to alleviate these problems, such as the 2014
increase in the non-taxable minimum allowance, but more is needed. In particular, the cuts to
Latvia’s Guaranteed Minimum Income (GMI) benefit in 2013, and the de-centralization of the
scheme’s financing should be reversed, in line with the recommendations of the World Bank study.
15.
Current fiscal policies could significantly reduce the budget envelope and constrain
priority spending over the medium term. Planned declines in the PIT rate and SOEs’ payout ratio,
together with increases in tax allowances and cuts in social contributions, are estimated to reduce
2

The FDL sets a medium-term objective (MTO) of 0.5 percent of GDP, but permits deviations from this target for
revenue transfers to the privately managed Pillar II pension fund. The FDL is designed to be compatible with Latvia’s
commitments under the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP).

estimate that additional revenue
measures equivalent to 0.6 percent of
GDP in 2016 and 2017 will be needed to
safeguard priority investment,
particularly infrastructure investment
(thus keeping public capital expenditure
above a historical low of about three
percent of GDP), and social spending,
including on improving social exclusion
benefits and introducing progressive tax
allowances. Alternatively, sizable
expenditure reductions would be
required in other areas, but staff and the
authorities agreed that there was limited
scope for substantial permanent cuts in
other parts of the budget, given the
already low level of public expenditures
in Latvia (see text chart).

Several options could be
considered to open fiscal space while
reducing inequality. 4 First the PIT rate
cut should be reconsidered. While the
authorities view the PIT cut as a measure to
improve work incentives, a more targeted way
to achieve this goal would be to further
expand the non-taxable minimum allowance,
and to introduce a more gradual phasing-out
of the GMI benefit, which currently falls oneto-one with income. Second, property tax
revenue, which currently amounts to less than
0.8 percent of GDP, (well below European and
OECD average levels) should be expanded.

municipalities to raise the real estate tax rate

The PIT rate is scheduled to be lowered by one percentage point in 2015 and again in 2016, while SOE payout ratios
are to be cut from the current 90 percent level to 70 percent in 2016 and to 27 percent in 2017.

4

The measures considered here have a permanent effect on revenue, i.e., if enacted in 2016 a measure would entail a
gain in 2017 and future years as well (provided it is not reversed).

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF LATVIA

on high-valued land and buildings above the current 1.5 percent ceiling. This should go hand-inhand with cadastral reform to remove substantial discrepancies in property valuation, for instance
between old and renovated or new buildings and to correct inconsistent valuation of agricultural
land; such discrepancies damage both tax collection and credibility. Third, the cap on social security
contributions could be removed (while maintaining the cap on benefits). The combined effect of
these measures should suffice to close the revenue gap estimated under current policies. Moreover,
other options exist should the authorities choose not to fully implement the measures above. For
example, the minimum non-taxable threshold for pensioners and the tax allowance for dependents
could be reduced, and excises on fuel used in agriculture raised, in conjunction with better-targeted
direct support for low- and middle-income households. Alternatively, the corporate income tax rate,
which is among the lowest in the EU, could be raised.
17.
The authorities recognized the need for enhancing revenue over the medium term and
reducing inequality. They emphasized ongoing measures for combating the grey economy, noting
the significant gains achieved to-date, and agreed that revenues from property taxes could be
improved. They were not amenable to reversing and decentralizing the cuts to the GMI benefit this
year, but noted that medium-term plans are under consideration for increasing GMI benefits within
an integrated social benefit system (under which a minimum level of combined benefits—
comprising the GMI, unemployment insurance, parental benefits, etc—would be defined relative to
the economy’s median wage). They will also consider introducing progressive minimum non-taxable
thresholds in the future, which would help ameliorate inequality.

B. Financial Supervision
18.
Latvia’s three largest banks comfortably passed the ECB’s Comprehensive Assessment.
The wider banking system is also well capitalized and liquid, with an average CET1 ratio of about
18 percent and a liquidity ratio of around 64 percent, substantially higher than regulatory minimum
requirements of 8 percent and 30 percent respectively. Citadele, the “good bank” created upon the
dissolution of Parex, was sold to a consortium of international investors within the timetable set by
DG Competition.5 The sale triggered the exercise of a put-option equivalent to about 0.4 percent of
GDP compensating the EBRD for its injection of equity capital in Parex at the outset of the crisis.
19.
Banking supervision is now shared between the Latvian regulator (the FCMC) and the
SSM. The SSM directly supervises Latvia’s three largest banks, accounting for about 42 percent of
the banking system by assets. The Joint Supervisory Teams (JSTs) for these banks are led by an ECB
official and include Latvian representation. On the other hand, the Colleges of Supervisors for the
large banking groups—two of which are subsidiaries of Swedish parent banks and are among
Latvia’s three largest banks— are chaired by the Swedish supervisory authorities and include
representatives from the ECB , while Latvia’s FCMC has observerstatus. The authorities report that
information sharing and cooperation among these supervisory bodies has so far been good. They
5

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

9

REPUBLIC OF LATVIA

agreed with staff that open communication channels among the ECB, the Swedish regulators and
the FCMC will remain essential going forward, especially when capital and liquidity conditions are
less benign than at present.
20.
Ongoing geopolitical tensions and the deep economic downturn in Russia highlight
potential risks stemming from the high level of NRDs in Latvia’s banking system. NRDs, over
80 percent of which are estimated to originate from Russia and other CIS countries, currently
account for about half of the banking sector’s total deposits, and could therefore be vulnerable to a
sudden stop or flow reversal. Moreover, since NRDs are covered by the country’s deposit guarantee
scheme, they represent a significant contingent fiscal liability.6 That said, to date there are few signs
of NRD inflows being impeded due to geopolitical events (Box 1). Risks to the domestic economy
are mitigated by various factors. NRD banks hold the major share of their assets abroad in liquid
instruments such as European and US government securities, and bank deposits.7 They are already
subject to higher capital and liquidity requirements, in line with past staff advice. Moreover, the
FCMC plans to impose a “business model risk” add-on to NRD banks’ contributions to Latvia’s
deposit guarantee scheme, ensuring that NRD banks pay more into the scheme per dollar of
deposits.
21.
The authorities remain keenly aware of the need for vigilant supervision of the NRD
banking sector. AML / CFT supervision is being strengthened and made more risk-based. The
Latvian bank regulator, the FCMC, reported that it conducts frequent offsite and onsite bank
inspections, and that customer due diligence guidelines have been strengthened since the Moneyval
report in 2012. The authorities noted that the Financial Intelligence Unit responsible for fighting
money laundering and other financial crimes now receives greater budgetary support—which it has
used to expand staff, undertake more training programs and invest in more sophisticated riskassessment software—and works in cooperation with the State Revenue Service and foreign
regulators.

C. Resuscitating Bank Credit
22.
Bank deleveraging reflects both demand and supply factors. The debt overhang and
uncertain outlook continue to hold back credit growth and investment in an environment of
tightened lending standards. Discussions with bank representatives suggest that SMEs and low
income households in particular face hurdles accessing funding because of the higher risks they
represent and their lack of collateral. The credit contraction has persisted well past the point in the
cycle when most countries see a resumption of credit growth.8 It is particularly worrying in the
6

As a recent example, the bankruptcy of Latvijas Krajbanka—which in September 2011 accounted for about 1½
percent of Latvia’s NRDs and 8 percent of domestic deposits—required the Deposit Guarantee Fund to pay out
about 336 million lats (about 2.2 percent of GDP) to cover insured deposits, of which 200 million lats came from a
treasury loan.

context of a tightening labor market and high real
wage growth. For several years after the trough of the
crisis, firms were able to finance investment through
retained profits, since productivity growth outstripped
wages. But now the lack of credit is likely to be a
binding constraint on investment.

Sources: CSB and IMF staff calculations.
while they have indeed tightened lending standards
since the crisis, the main reason for anemic lending is
lack of demand. The reduction in their loan book over the last few years has created excess cash
holdings, which in turn have been repatriated to the parent banks; thus the observed increase in the
percentage of local deposit funding for the subsidiaries is not a conscious change in business model
but rather a consequence of excess liquidity.
24.
The recently created Single Development Institute (SDI) is appropriately taking a more
active role in supporting SME lending.9 The SDI has introduced a number of programs designed
to catalyze private bank lending, including loan guarantee schemes and a program to reduce credit
risk for private lenders by providing subordinated loans. The authorities also pointed to recent
efforts to develop credit bureaus to make available potential borrowers’ credit related information in
a standardized way, which would help banks to screen borrowers and reduce informational
asymmetries in the loan market. Staff encouraged all these initiatives, while noting that care is
needed to ensure that the SDI is genuinely addressing market failures rather than supporting
unviable businesses.
25.
Policy measures to reduce the still high debt overhang would increase demand for
credit while improving perceptions of credit risk on the supply side. While earlier legal
amendments have already strengthened the insolvency regime, its administration and
implementation could be further improved. Banks report that insolvency procedures can be very
lengthy and insolvency administrators obstructive. The authorities pointed to various measures
being planned, or already implemented, to reduce the backlog of pending cases, such as a greater
number of courts and better specialization and allocation of judges across courts. A new law makes

Guarantee Agency, the Rural Development Fund and the Mortgage and Land Bank.

insolvency administrators state officials, subjecting them to greater income disclosure and stricter
supervision. And reforms are underway to encourage mediation or arbitration as an alternative to
much lengthier regular court procedures.
26.
A compromise has been reached on the implementation of recent amendments to the
insolvency law which could have had the unintended consequence of further dampening
credit supply. The amendments—passed by Parliament last year—limited the liability of mortgage
borrowers to collateral and reduced the discharge period for debtors from 3.5 years to 1 year after
declaring insolvency. While the amendments did not apply retroactively, thus limiting the immediate
impact on bank balance sheets, they created further uncertainty amid an already weak lending
environment. Several banks responded by charging higher mortgage down payments and rationing
credit to low-income households and households that live outside major cities, despite the
amendments not having taken effect. Staff therefore welcomed the recent compromise which
requires banks to offer customers a choice between a “regular” mortgage and a limited-recourse
mortgage of the type prescribed by the amendments (which can be priced differently).

D. Structural Reforms
27.
Latvia’s most important medium-term challenge is to maintain competitiveness within
the Euro Area currency union. The substantial real depreciation following the crisis allowed the
country to make rapid competitiveness gains, but now that the exchange rate is broadly in line with
fundamentals (see External Assessment), the focus must shift to structural reforms. In order for
Latvia to consistently exceed average Euro Area growth and thereby close the income gap with core
economies, productivity growth must be supported by appropriate policies. Over the last two years,
wages have grown rapidly as labor market slack has diminished, and this is reflected in a slight
erosion of competitiveness as measured by unit labor costs. Against this background—and in the
context of large increases to the minimum wage in 2014 and 2015—staff recommended that future
increases should not exceed productivity growth. The authorities concurred that future changes to
the minimum wage would need to take account of economic developments.
28.
Labor market reforms to improve work incentives should be implemented. A system of
in-work tax credits and benefits should be considered because empirical evidence suggests that
these have proven effective in increasing employment of lower skilled workers. Active labor market
policies (AMLPs) should continue to be strengthened. The coverage ratio of ALMPs has improved
substantially, from 42 percent in 2012 to 62 percent in 2014, partly due to the decline in the
unemployment rate. The authorities pointed to several active projects targeted at various segments
of the unemployed population, including an active ageing project as well as measures to improve
internal mobility.
29.
Upgrading public infrastructure and improving state-owned enterprise (SOE)
governance are important elements of strengthening competitiveness. Improving public
infrastructure could also help attract FDI and associated technological knowhow. Moreover, the
current juncture is propitious for well-planned projects to attract centralized funding from the

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF LATVIA

Juncker plan. An important area where reforms are both necessary and well-identified is ports: Riga
and Ventspils ports both remain overly dependant on low-value added bulk traffic and face strong
competition, especially from Russian ports. Staff urged speedy implementation of the
recommendations of the World Bank study on ports, which made several specific suggestions to
increase capacity and enhance connectivity to land transport, while improving governance and
accountability. On a related front, centralizing SOE management while divesting non-core
activities—in line with long-planned reforms—would improve efficiency and accountability,
contributing to an improvement in the business environment. The authorities noted that a working
group has been set up to consider the World Bank recommendations on ports, while a framework
law to strengthen SOE governance was passed in October 2014. The latter will require a centralized
SOE manager to be established, and independent boards and annual reporting will be re-introduced
for largest SOEs.
30.
Reforms to higher and vocational education would help reduce skills mismatches and
structural unemployment. The authorities—in conjunction with European partners—have already
developed an ambitious reform agenda. Plans include introducing quality-based accreditation of
study fields, consolidation of higher education institutions (which are currently too numerous) and
better targeting of public funds to universities (shifting resources from social sciences to STEM
fields). A new financing model for higher education that seeks to reward quality is being prepared in
cooperation with World Bank experts. These measures, together with the promotion of EU foreign
(i.e. not Latvian) languages in teaching, would build a more skilled workforce. Meanwhile, reforms to
vocational education could help reduce skills mismatches and hence alleviate structural
unemployment in the medium-term. Efforts should continue to expand vocational training from a
pilot program encompassing 6 institutions to a wider base of institutions, and to include a council of
social partners and sector experts. The authorities agreed with staff that unwavering implementation
of the education reform agenda would be crucial over the next few years.

STAFF APPRAISAL
31.
Latvia’s economic slowdown is expected to persist this year. GDP growth is estimated to
have decelerated to about 2.4 percent in 2014, reflecting the prolonged closure of steel
manufacturer Liepajas Metalurgs, and weak economic performance in the Euro Area and Russia
amid rising geopolitical tensions. In 2015 the anemic external environment—particularly the sharp
recession in Russia—will continue to weigh on exports and investment. This is expected to be
somewhat mitigated by higher disposable income due to lower oil prices and robust real wages, the
reopening of LM, and the accommodative monetary stance of the ECB.
32.
Faster medium-term growth will be necessary if Latvia is to close the income gap with
the rest of the Euro Area, but this cannot be taken for granted. Medium-term growth of around
4 percent should be feasible. But adverse demographic trends will exert a downward pull on the
growth trajectory, so robust growth depends on reforms to reduce still-high structural
unemployment, and on boosting capital accumulation and labor productivity. Moreover, the near-

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

REPUBLIC OF LATVIA

term forecast is subject to several downside risks, most importantly a prolonged slowdown in
important trading partners such as Russia and the Euro Area.
33.
While the 2015 budget is broadly appropriate, fiscal space needs to be built-up over
the medium-term. Automatic stabilizers should be allowed to operate fully this year, given the
weak and uncertain external environment. Over the medium-term, various factors, such as planned
reductions to the personal income tax (PIT) rate, could constrain the budget’s capacity for necessary
capital and social expenditure. The authorities should explore ways to increase the revenue
envelope, for example by reconsidering future PIT rate cuts, greater land taxation in conjunction
with cadastre reform, the removal of the cap on social security contributions, and better targeting of
a number of tax allowances. Such measures would complement the welcome focus on shrinking the
grey economy through better tax compliance.
34.
The continuing contraction of bank credit is increasingly likely to constrain
investment. Staff supports recent public sector initiatives to catalyze SME lending, including by
providing loan guarantees, taking subordinated positions and encouraging the development of
credit bureaus. Reforms to insolvency procedures and the court system are needed to encourage
writedowns and accelerate the reduction in private sector debt. This would provide a spur to new
lending from both the demand and supply side.
35.
So far there have been no significant disruptions to NRD flows arising from
geopolitical tensions. But the Russia-Ukraine conflict highlights the need for maintaining vigilant
supervision of NRD banks, which account for almost half of all deposits in the banking system. In this
context, the authorities are encouraged to continue their efforts to strengthen and effectively
implement the AML/CFT framework. Appropriately, the Financial Intelligence Unit responsible for
combating money laundering and financial terrorism has been strengthened. Minimum capital and
liquidity requirements are higher for NRD banks, in line with previous staff advice; and the
authorities plan to impose on NRDs proportionately higher contributions to the deposit guarantee
fund.
36.
Latvia’s most important medium-term challenge is to maintain competitiveness within
the Euro Area currency union. Future increases to the minimum wage should not exceed
productivity growth. In order for Latvia to consistently exceed average Euro Area growth and
thereby close the income gap with core economies, productivity growth must be supported by
appropriate structural policies. Reforms are needed in a number of areas such as labor markets,
higher and vocational education, infrastructure, and SOE management.
37.
Staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard
12-month cycle.

Box 1. Republic of Latvia: Russia Linkages
Latvia is strongly linked to Russia through both trade and finance. Russia accounted for around
11 percent of Latvia’s exports of goods and services in 2013. Trade linkages have strengthened in the past
decade due to the faster growth of the Russian economy compared to Latvia’s other trading partners. As a
regional banking centre, Latvia also receives a large amount of Russian deposits. More than 80 percent of
non-resident deposits (NRDs) in the Latvian banking system come from CIS countries, mostly Russia. Latvia’s
linkages with Ukraine are much weaker: Ukraine accounted for only 1 percent of Latvia’s exports in 2013.
Latvia is currently fully dependent on Russia for gas imports. Supply has so far been reliable, and in any
event Latvia has a large gas storage facility in Incukalns. A new LNG terminal at the port of Klaipeda,
Lithuania, capable of meeting most of the Baltic countries’ gas needs, will become operational this year.
With Lithuania upgrading its pipelines to Latvia, natural gas imported through the LNG terminal can be
supplied to Latvia.
Slower Russian GDP growth is expected to lower Latvia’s growth directly through the trade channel
and through second round effects. Every 1 percent decline in Russia’s GDP growth is estimated to directly
reduce Latvia’s export growth by 0.4 percent and GDP growth by 0.2 percent. Persistently weaker Russian
demand for Latvian goods and services may negatively affect Latvian GDP through second round effects,
increasing precautionary savings (hence reducing consumption) and dampening investment sentiment. The
recent crash in oil price is expected to pull down Russian GDP growth in 2015 by around 3–4 percent, which
is expected to slow down Latvia’s growth by around 0.6–0.8 percent.
Russian counter-sanctions have had only a marginal impact on Latvia’s economy. The Russian
measures were directed at Latvian food exports, but food exports to Russia as a share of Latvian GDP are
small. Moreover, Latvian food exporters are expected to find new markets to substitute the loss of the
Russian market. On the other hand, counter-sanctions may exert a downward pull on food prices and
inflation. Moreover, if geopolitical tensions and the cycle of sanctions and counter-sanctions were to
escalate, the effect on Latvia could be much more serious.
So far the Russia-Ukraine conflict has had little discernible impact on the Latvian banking system.
Although some small banks experienced large drops in NRDs after sanctions against Russia were
announced, overall there was no disruption of NRD inflows. In fact NRD deposit growth in 2014 was more
robust than in the previous year: after correcting for valuation effects from the euro’s movement against the
dollar the growth rate of NRDs reached 14 percent (y-on-y) in December 2014, compared to 8.3 percent in
December 2013.
Russian FDI to Latvia somewhat surprisingly accelerated in the first half of 2014. Russia’s share in
inward FDI was stable at around 6 percent in the first and second quarters of 2014, higher than around
4.5 percent in 2012–13. This is consistent with strong NRD inflows, suggesting that the incentives of Russian
investors to allocate their deposits and capital to Latvia have not so far been harmed by geopolitical
tensions.

Box 2. Republic of Latvia: External Sector Assessment
The macroeconomic imbalances of the pre-crisis period have been largely addressed, and the current account
is close to balance. Model-based assessments suggest that the exchange rate is broadly in line with
fundamentals. However, the substantial competitiveness gains that accrued to Latvia from correcting its
overvalued real exchange rate have now been exhausted, and the focus will need to shift to generating
sustained improvements in productivity.
Exchange rate assessments based on CGER methodologies conclude that the REER is broadly in line
with fundamentals (Table A). The external sustainability (ES) and the macroeconomic balance (MB)
approaches indicate that the Latvia’s REER is close to equilibrium. The equilibrium real exchange rate (ERER)
points to a higher misalignment than the other two methodologies, showing a moderate overvaluation. In

Latvia, where there have been profound structural changes over the last decade, the former two
estimates are likely more reliable, producing results very close to one another, and consistent with
external sector developments.

The EBA-lite methodology concludes that Latvia’s policies are broadly appropriate, but finds an
unrealistically large real exchange rate undervaluation. A small policy gap of 1 percent is estimated,
suggesting that Latvia’s fiscal, external (reserves and capital account), and financial policies are appropriate.
But the current account norm is estimated as -5.5 percent of GDP, much larger than the actual 2014 CA
deficit of -3.1 percent. This result should be interpreted with caution, as it seems inconsistent with the
country’s still high negative net international investment position, which would deteriorate further if the
actual current account deficit were in line with the model’s estimated current account norm. The underlying
model does not appear to capture well

An examination of REER time-series (Panel 6) suggests that there have been very substantial gains in
competitiveness since the crisis, but recent developments present a more mixed picture. The HIPCbased REER has appreciated modestly by 2.5 percent since 2013, reflecting NEER appreciation somewhat
mitigated by a decline in Latvia’s HIPC relative to its main trading partners—many of which, such as the
Nordics and CIS countries, are outside the Euro Area. Real wage growth continued to be strong in 2014, and
this is reflected in a simple index of export profitability—the ratio of the export deflator to nominal ULCs—

in Euro Area, will pose challenges to export expansion,
despite mitigating effects from the euro depreciation and the recent drop in oil prices. Now that Latvia has
joined the Euro Area and the severe wage restraint of the crisis period is being unwound, the focus must
shift to generating productivity improvements that consistently exceed wage growth. A major effort should
be made, inter alia, on reforms to upgrade the country’s infrastructure, reduce skills mismatches in the labor
market, improve work incentives, speed up the judicial process and reform SOE governance.

External debt increased slightly in 2014, owing to government Eurobond issuances and exchange rate
developments, but remains contained. The government issued 2 billion of Eurobonds in 2014 partly to
amortize European Commission loans. In addition, the euro value of dollar-denominated debt, estimated at
39.4 percent of GDP or 28.1 percent of total debt, has increased following the depreciation of the euro
against the dollar. However the largest share of dollar-denominated debt is owed by banks, mostly by NRDbanks, the majority of whose assets are held abroad in liquid instruments, and which face restrictions on
currency mismatches. Over the medium-term external debt is expected to resume its post-crisis downward
trend, decreasing by more than 10 percentage points by the end of the projection period. Capital flows are
expected to be stable and sufficient to cover the modest CA deficit, as they have been for the past few years.
The main components of capital flows are government bond issuances, Nordic parent bank funding, and
NRDs.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely
to materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks
surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between
10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability between 30 and 50 percent). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of
risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may
interact and materialize jointly.

*/ Latvia is characterized as a low-scrutiny contry despite financing needs marginally exceed the 10 percent threshold in two years, 2015 and 2020. The excess in 2020 is
marginal, while financing needs in 2015 are already mostly convered. Latvia has been very successful in accessing markets recently and have been repeatedly upgraded by
by rating agencies.
1/ Public sector is defined as general government.
2/ Based on available data.
3/ Long-term bond spread over German bonds.
4/ Defined as interest payments divided by debt stock (excluding guarantees) at the end of previous year.
5/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;
a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
6/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
7/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as ae(1+r).
8/ Includes asset changes and interest revenues (if any). For projections, includes exchange rate changes during the projection period.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

Exchange Rate Arrangement:
As of January 1, 2014, the currency of Latvia is the euro, which floats freely and independently against
other currencies. Prior to 2014, the currency of Latvia was the lat, which was introduced in March 1993
to replace the Latvian ruble. The exchange rate was pegged to the SDR from February 1994 to
December 2004, within a ±1 percent band. On January 1, 2005, the lat was re-pegged to the euro at
the rate 1 euro = 0.702804 lats, and on April 29, 2005, Latvia entered ERM II, maintaining the previous
band width. Latvia maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on the payments or transfers for
current international transactions. Exchange restrictions maintained for security reasons have been
notified to the Fund for approval most recently in January 2013 (see EBD/13/3, January 28, 2013).
Previous Article IV Consultation:
Latvia is on the 12-month consultation cycle. The last Article IV consultation was concluded on
May 2, 2014 (IMF Country Report No. 14/115). The Executive Board assessment is available at
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pr/2014/pr14205.htm.
Safeguards Assessment:
The safeguards assessment completed on July 8, 2009 concluded that the Bank of Latvia (BoL)
operates robust internal audit and control systems. The assessment recommended clarifying the
respective roles of the BoL and the Treasury in holding, managing, and reporting to the Fund audited
international reserves data. It also recommended amendments to the mandate of the BoL’s audit
committee and improvements to the financial statements' disclosures. The authorities have already
taken steps to implement these recommendations, notably by establishing a formal arrangement
between the BoL and the Treasury, revising the audit committee charter and expanding the existing
accounting framework.
FSAP Participation and ROSCs:
A joint World Bank-International Monetary Fund mission conducted an assessment of Latvia’s
financial sector as part of the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) during
February 14–28, 2001. The Financial Sector Stability Assessment (FSSA) report was discussed at the
Board on January 18, 2002, together with the 2001 Article IV staff report (Country Report No. 02/10).
An AML/CFT assessment mission took place during March 8–24, 2006, and the report was sent to the
Board on May 23, 2007. A joint IMF-World Bank mission conducted an FSAP Update during
February 27–March 9, 2007. A World Bank mission conducted an FSAP development module during
November 8–18, 2011. Moneyval conducted a follow-up assessment during May 9–13, 2011, and the
mutual evaluation report was adopted on July 5, 2012.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision to the Fund for surveillance purposes is classified as adequate (A). Latvia is a
subscriber of the SDDS (Special Data Dissemination Standard) and a link to Latvia’s metadata is available at the
IMF’s website for the DSBB (Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board).
National Accounts: The CSB compiles and publishes quarterly national accounts with the production and
expenditure approaches on a regular and timely basis. Since September 2011, national accounts are calculated
with the NACE rev. 2 classifications, determined by the European Commission. However, there are
discrepancies between the GDP estimates based on production and those based on expenditure. The
statistical discrepancy is included in changes in inventories on the expenditure side.
The underlying data for the production approach are obtained primarily through a survey of businesses and
individuals, and are supplemented by data from labor force surveys and administrative sources. The CSB
believes that the basic data understate economic activity, particularly in the private sector, and there is an
ongoing effort to increase coverage. Additional data for the expenditure-based accounts are obtained from
household budget surveys and other surveys from the State Treasury and ministries.
Government finance statistics: Fund staff is provided quarterly with monthly information on revenues and
expenditures of the central and local governments and special budgets. With some limitations, the available
information permits the compilation of consolidated accounts of the general government. The Government
Finance Statistics database in the IMF’s eLibrary website contains cash data in the GFSM 2001 format. Quarterly
general government data on an accrual basis are provided through Eurostat for the International Financial
Statistics on a timely basis.
Monetary statistics: Monetary statistics could provide more detail in the liabilities of depository corporations
by subsectors of the general government in line with international standards.
Balance of payments: The BoL assumed responsibility for compiling the balance of payments statistics from
the CSB in early 2000. The data collection program is a mixed system, with surveys supplemented by monthly
information from the international transactions reporting system (ITRS), and administrative sources. Contrary
to international standards—but similar to a number of other EU countries—the BoL includes provisions for
expected losses of foreign-owned banks. Between Q4 2008–Q2 2010, this treatment led to the recording of
negative reinvested earnings (i.e., losses) of foreign-owned banks as negative outflows. These “inflows” in the
income account of the balance of payments thus gave a positive contribution to the current account.
Data Standards and Quality: Latvia is a participant in the IMF’s Special Data Dissemination Standard since
November 1, 1996. A Data ROSC was published in June 2004.
Reporting to STA: The authorities are reporting data for the Fund’s International Financial Statistics,
Government Finance Statistics Yearbook, the Direction of Trade Statistics, and the Balance of Payments
Statistics Yearbook.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2015 Article IV Consultation with the Republic of Latvia
On April 24, 2015, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation1 with the Republic of Latvia, and considered and endorsed the staff
appraisal without a meeting.2
Latvia’s strong recovery has recently slowed in the face of sluggish growth in the euro area and
deteriorating economic conditions in Russia amid rising geopolitical tensions. GDP growth
decelerated to 2.4 percent in 2014 reflecting weak demand and the prolonged closure of a steel
manufacturer (Liepajas Metalurgs). Low food and energy prices held consumer price inflation
around 0.7 percent despite rising real wages.
The 2014 general government deficit of about 1.4 percent of GDP was higher than expected due
mainly to a one-off payment related to the sale of Citadele bank. The negative budgetary impact
of the economic slowdown was largely offset by revenue gains from improved tax compliance
and higher wages.
Bank balance sheets continued to strengthen. Profitability increased and the ratio of nonperforming loans declined. But credit continued to contract. Growth of non-resident deposits
(NRDs) in the banking system was stable.
In 2015, the weak external environment, particularly the sharp slowdown in Russia, will continue
to weigh on exports and investment. This is expected to be mitigated, but not fully offset, by
higher disposable income due to lower oil prices and robust real wages, the reopening of the steel
manufacturer, and the accommodative monetary stance of the ECB. Over time, growth would
rise to around 4 percent.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

2

The Executive Board takes decisions under its lapse-of-time procedure when the Board agrees that a proposal can
be considered without convening formal discussions.

2
Executive Board Assessment
In concluding the 2015 Article IV consultation with the Republic of Latvia, Executive Directors
endorsed staff’s appraisal, as follows:
Latvia’s economic slowdown is expected to persist this year. GDP growth is estimated to have
decelerated to about 2.4 percent in 2014, reflecting the prolonged closure of steel manufacturer
Liepajas Metalurgs, and weak economic performance in the euro area and Russia amid rising
geopolitical tensions. In 2015 the anemic external environment—particularly the sharp recession
in Russia—will continue to weigh on exports and investment. This is expected to be somewhat
mitigated by higher disposable income due to lower oil prices and robust real wages, the
reopening of LM, and the accommodative monetary stance of the ECB.
Faster medium-term growth will be necessary if Latvia is to close the income gap with the rest of
the euro area, but this cannot be taken for granted. Medium-term growth of around 4 percent
should be feasible. But adverse demographic trends will exert a downward pull on the growth
trajectory, so robust growth depends on reforms to reduce still-high structural unemployment,
and on boosting capital accumulation and labor productivity. Moreover, the near-term forecast is
subject to several downside risks, most importantly a prolonged slowdown in important trading
partners such as Russia and the euro area.
While the 2015 budget is broadly appropriate, fiscal space needs to be built-up over the mediumterm. Automatic stabilizers should be allowed to operate fully this year, given the weak and
uncertain external environment. Over the medium-term, various factors, such as planned
reductions to the personal income tax (PIT) rate, could constrain the budget’s capacity for
necessary capital and social expenditure. The authorities should explore ways to increase the
revenue envelope, for example by reconsidering future PIT rate cuts, greater land taxation in
conjunction with cadastre reform, the removal of the cap on social security contributions, and
better targeting of a number of tax allowances. Such measures would complement the welcome
focus on shrinking the grey economy through better tax compliance.
The continuing contraction of bank credit is increasingly likely to constrain investment. Staff
supports recent public sector initiatives to catalyze SME lending, including by providing loan
guarantees, taking subordinated positions and encouraging the development of credit bureaus.
Reforms to insolvency procedures and the court system are needed to encourage writedowns and
accelerate the reduction in private sector debt. This would provide a spur to new lending from
both the demand and supply side.
So far there have been no significant disruptions to NRD flows arising from geopolitical
tensions. But the Russia-Ukraine conflict highlights the need for maintaining vigilant supervision
of NRD banks, which account for almost half of all deposits in the banking system. In this
context, the authorities are encouraged to continue their efforts to strengthen and effectively

3
implement the AML/CFT framework. Appropriately, the Financial Intelligence Unit responsible
for combating money laundering and financial terrorism has been strengthened. Minimum capital
and liquidity requirements are higher for NRD banks, in line with previous staff advice; and the
authorities plan to impose on NRDs proportionately higher contributions to the deposit guarantee
fund.
Latvia’s most important medium-term challenge is to maintain competitiveness within the euro
area currency union. Future increases to the minimum wage should not exceed productivity
growth. In order for Latvia to consistently exceed average euro area growth and thereby close the
income gap with core economies, productivity growth must be supported by appropriate
structural policies. Reforms are needed in a number of areas such as labor markets, higher and
vocational education, infrastructure, and SOE management.
