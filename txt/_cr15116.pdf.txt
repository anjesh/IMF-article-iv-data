STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
DISCUSSIONS

KEY ISSUES
Context: Aruba is a small, tourism-dependent economy with a pegged exchange rate
regime against the USD and one of the highest living standards in the Caribbean. The
economy is recovering from the double-dip recession of the global financial crisis and
the end of oil refining activity, but real GDP is projected to return to its pre-crisis level
only by the end of the decade. Risks to the outlook are mainly external in nature. Despite
the major entitlement reforms undertaken, debt surpassed 80 percent of GDP in 2014.
Policy recommendations:
 Rebuild policy space while supporting the ongoing recovery. In particular, putting
debt on a downward trajectory is an immediate policy priority. A fiscal effort is
needed to attain a surplus of 1½ percent of GDP by 2020, which would put debt on
a downward path.


The accommodative monetary policy stance is appropriate and international reserves
are currently adequate to safeguard the peg.



Increasing labor market flexibility and reducing the costs of doing business would
improve Aruba’s competitiveness and resilience to shocks. Future growth initiatives,
including those related to renewable energy, should be financed through FDI.

INTRODUCTION
1.
Aruba is a highly open, tourism-dependent economy, with one of the highest living
standards in the Caribbean (Box 1). Over 85 percent of the economy depends directly or indirectly
on tourism, making Aruba the third most tourism-dependent country in the world. As a reflection of
this marked dependence on external economic conditions, the volatility of Aruba’s growth has been
among the highest in the region. However, the fixed exchange rate regime against the USD
(unchanged since 1971), supported by conservative fiscal, credit, and prudential policies, ensured low
inflation and had kept imbalances in check until recent years (Figure 1).
2.
The main policy challenge is rebuilding policy space while supporting the ongoing
recovery. Repeated shocks have resulted in a double-dip recession which has eroded the authorities’
fiscal policy space. Public debt increased

recovery.
3.
Past Fund advice focused on ensuring fiscal sustainability through the development of
a medium-term adjustment program. In particular, recommendations underscored the need to
improve the financial situations of Aruba’s pension and health care schemes. The authorities
undertook key entitlement reforms in 2014 and have presented a medium-term budget plan which
aims to attain a small fiscal surplus by 2018. Notwithstanding these efforts, however, additional
measures and determined implementation will be needed to achieve the authorities’ ambitious fiscal
targets.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS, OUTLOOK, AND RISKS
A. Recent Economic Developments
4.
Aruba is recovering gradually from a severe double-dip recession. The economy suffered
two major shocks over the past five years: the global financial crisis and closure of the Valero oil
refinery in 2012 (Figure 2). After a strong recovery in 2013, with growth at 4¾ percent, the pace of
activity moderated in 2014. Despite very strong tourism growth, the loss in momentum reflected a

4

KINGDOM OF THE NETHERLANDS—ARUBA

broad-based contraction in domestic demand due to waning confidence, fiscal policy uncertainty,
and investment delays. The unemployment rate is estimated to have remained broadly flat in 2014 at
about 7½ percent. Recent data indicate positive but low headline inflation rates at around
½ percent, below the average of the last decade (2½ percent).

and 35 percent of broad money.

B. Outlook and Risks
Staff views
6.
Growth is projected to rise to 2¼ percent in 2015. The tourism sector—the mainstay of
the Aruban economy—is expected to continue to grow, albeit at a slower pace than over the past
two years. At the same time, domestic demand is poised to recover appreciably as policy uncertainty
subsides and key public-private partnership (PPP) projects move forward (Green Corridor, Ring
Road 3). Hedging contracts set by the utility company above the current level of global oil prices are
limiting downward inflationary pressures, and along with the 11¾ percent energy tariff increase and
the introduction of the health-care levy in late 2014, inflation is expected to increase to ¾ percent in
2015. While the overall CA balance is expected to remain in deficit, buoyant tourism exports would
help reduce its size to –3½ percent of GDP in 2015.
7.
Under the baseline scenario, real GDP is expected to reach its pre-recession level only
by 2019. Market diversification is expected to keep real growth in tourism exports steady at around
1¾ percent, but the large and lingering gaps in investment and non-tourism exports (both of which
are still 40 percent below their pre-recessions peaks) due to the termination of oil refining activities
will be filled only gradually. The CA deficit is expected to narrow in line with contributions from the
services balance, but remain sizable due to income and transfer outflows, and continued oil trade
deficits. External debt is projected to remain close to 95 percent of GDP.
8.
Risks to the outlook are broadly balanced and mainly external (see RAM). The closure of
the oil refinery implies a narrower economic base and even greater dependence on tourism. This
concentration risk is compounded by the fact that around 55 percent of tourism originates from the
U.S. Therefore, while global economic conditions matter, Aruba is most susceptible to spillovers

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

KINGDOM OF THE NETHERLANDS--ARUBA

associated with U.S. slowdowns. In particular, notwithstanding the usual confidence bands around
estimated elasticities, model-based estimates suggest that each 1 percentage point temporary
decline in U.S. growth would drag Aruba’s growth lower by 2 percentage points for two years (Box 2).
A deepening of Venezuela’s economic crisis is also a risk given that it is Aruba’s second most
important source of tourists. However, the appreciable decline in global oil prices and faster U.S.
growth represent upside risks. In the medium term, while renewable energy investments could boost
growth prospects, this upside is balanced by potential implementation delays. Over the longer term,
the lifting of the U.S. travel ban to Cuba could have implications for Aruban tourism.
Authorities’ views
9.
The authorities broadly agreed with the staff’s diagnosis of the economic outlook and
risks. They were confident that robust tourism growth would continue to underpin a steady recovery
going forward. While the authorities generally concurred with staff’s analysis quantifying the
importance of U.S. spillovers, they pointed out that continued efforts to diversify tourists from within
the U.S. and the ongoing success in catering to a progressively more upscale market are factors
which have most likely increased Aruba’s resilience in recent years. They acknowledged the risks
surrounding Venezuela, but pointed to strategies to overcome potentially adverse developments
including initiatives to expand access to other Latin American markets (for example, Chile and Peru).
The authorities agreed that Cuba’s entry into the tourism market is a longer-term consideration, in
part because of the country’s lack of requisite infrastructure.

REBUILDING POLICY SPACE AND SUPPORTING THE
RECOVERY
The main policy challenge is to rebuild fiscal space while ensuring a steady recovery
through safeguarding financial stability and maintaining competitiveness.

A. Fiscal Policy: Ambitious Consolidation Needed
Background
10.
Following a rapid deterioration during 2008-2012, the fiscal deficit narrowed to 5¼
percent of GDP in 2014. Policies that were originally intended to be countercyclical, along with a
structural decline in output growth, have led to a significant worsening of the overall balance by
11 percentage points of GDP over 2008-2012 (Figure 3). In particular, expenditures increased sharply,
with wage-related costs accounting for about one-third of the cumulative increase (2¾ percent of
GDP over 2008-2012), and revenue performance suffered primarily because of the reduction in the
business turnover tax (BBO) rate from 3 percent to 1½ percent in 2010. In 2014, while revenue
performance was largely in line with expectations, expenditure restraint in the purchase of goods and
services together with the pension reforms yielded important savings. Nevertheless, public debt
surpassed 80 percent of GDP in 2014.

11.
The authorities undertook major structural reforms in 2014 to address the fiscal
challenges (Box 3). First, as a result of the general (AOV) pension reform, premiums were raised and
a gradual increase in the retirement age (to 65 years) was initiated. Second, the capital shortfall of
the public administration (APFA) pension system was made whole, the accrual period and franchise
contributions were modified and, as with the AOV, the retirement age will gradually increase. Third, a
levy was introduced to partially offset the fiscal costs of the health care system (AZV).

12.
Fiscal consolidation is planned to continue this year. Guided by a cabinet-approved
nominal expenditure ceiling, the authorities’ proposed budget plan aims to reduce the 2015 deficit
to 3¾ percent of GDP. Savings are expected to come mostly from entitlement reforms, supported by
a reduction in the number of public sector employees (for a total of 1½ percent of GDP). However,
measures underpinning ¾ percent of GDP of the planned adjustment are yet to be identified.
Specifically, while the authorities’ draft 2015 budget accounts for additional revenue from the healthcare levy, it does not factor in the projected increase in the underlying cost of providing health
services (¼ percent of GDP), nor does it fully account for higher debt service costs (½ percent of
GDP). Thus, staff forecasts a deficit of 4½ percent of GDP in 2015.
13.
Over the medium term, with the current policies, deficits would remain elevated, and
debt would continue to rise. Under the baseline scenario (without additional measures), the fiscal
deficit narrows modestly, reflecting the savings achieved through entitlement reforms (APFA, AOV,
AZV) enacted in 2014 and other past measures. However, debt is projected to exceed 90 percent of
GDP by 2020, making debt dynamics vulnerable to even small shocks (Appendix I). For example, even
a mild U.S. slowdown could significantly reduce Aruban growth. Under such a scenario, debt could
easily soar to over 100 percent of GDP by 2020 (text chart below). Going forward, these risks may be
further compounded by contingent liabilities associated with any new PPPs.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

KINGDOM OF THE NETHERLANDS--ARUBA

Staff’s views
14.
The authorities’ medium-term objectives are satisfactory, but current measures are
insufficient to achieve them. Aruba’s exposure to external shocks, a narrow economic base, a fixed
exchange rate regime, and sizable interest burden highlight the need to rebuild fiscal space. Noting
that the fiscal policy anchor is the overall balance, the entitlement reforms implemented by the
authorities and their ambitious medium-term adjustment path (culminating with a small surplus in
2018) are welcome. However, fiscal efforts should be sustained at least until 2020 to attain a surplus
of 1½ percent of GDP, which will help bring down public debt to slightly above 70 percent of GDP.
Nevertheless, these medium-term objectives will most likely not be achieved with current measures
(text table below). Without additional measures and steadfast implementation, deficits would remain
elevated, and debt would continue to trend upwards over the medium term. Elections scheduled for
2017 pose an additional risk to achieving these targets. Therefore, expeditiously establishing a strong
and effective medium-term fiscal framework would enhance the credibility of these plans.

15.
Achieving these fiscal targets will require additional revenue and expenditure
measures, including further entitlement reform:


8

Revenues. Additional revenue measures are needed given the size of the authorities’
planned adjustment. In particular, international comparison suggests that there is scope for
increasing revenue from indirect taxes. For example, estimates suggest that each
1 percentage point increase in the BBO rate could yield about Afl. 60 million (about
1.3 percent of GDP) in additional revenues. Current efforts to improve revenue administration
and to reduce tax arrears would yield tangible benefits only over the medium term. More
generally, a thorough review of the tax system seems warranted given its complexity (due in
part to a legacy of myriad tariff rates which can differ even for goods within the same broad
category) and the disproportionate reliance on direct taxation.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

KINGDOM OF THE NETHERLANDS—ARUBA



Expenditures. On the expenditure side, given the large size of the wage bill (compensation
of employees corresponds to nearly 50 percent of tax revenue), a key priority is to introduce
measures to permanently reduce wage-related expenses. Efforts should focus on slowing
wage drift due to automatic raises and promotions for time in grade, as well as modifying
public sector workers’ benefits and allowances. Steadfast adherence to the consolidation plan
would also appreciably reduce interest expenses by more than ½ percentage point of GDP in
2020. Furthermore, as Aruba is a very open economy, the envisaged fiscal consolidation
(underpinned by current expenditure curtailments and greater tax revenues) is not likely to
be a major drag on growth.1



Entitlement programs. Further measures are needed to ensure that the costly universal
health care system (AZV) becomes self-financing. In particular, the authorities should
consider introducing modest user fees to rationalize demand for certain health care services,
such as emergency room visits for non-urgent care.



PPPs. Any further costs associated with newly approved PPP should be fully accounted for in
a medium-term fiscal framework.

KINGDOM OF THE NETHERLANDS--ARUBA

Authorities’ views
16.
The authorities broadly agreed with the need for fiscal consolidation. Contrary to staff,
they are of the view that their medium-term fiscal adjustment plan contains sufficient measures to
meet their targets and without budget support or soft loans from the Netherlands. They noted that
previous decisions made as part of the tripartite social dialogue, which facilitated the entitlement
reforms, somewhat limit maneuver for additional reforms in the near term. Nevertheless, the
authorities see revenue measures as important to the fiscal consolidation effort, and have therefore
assembled a commission to study tax reform. Proposals, including on how to streamline the complex
tax system, are expected in a few months. They are also optimistic on significant one-off revenues
from the accumulation of tax debt. The authorities are also focusing on increasing expenditure
efficiency and are in the process of finalizing a consultant to conduct a public expenditure review. In
addition, they plan to continue to rationalize the wage bill by limiting new hires, introducing flexible
(including part-time) work arrangements, and providing outplacement services to some public
employees. The authorities are in close consultation with the Netherlands on how to tailor to Aruba’s
specific circumstance a fiscal council involving external budgetary oversight.

B. Monetary and Financial Sector Policies: Preserve Stability
Background
17.
Monetary policy remained unchanged during 2013–14. Despite the pegged exchange
rate regime, restrictions on capital mobility (dating back to 1986) allow for some monetary control in
Aruba.2 The Central Bank of Aruba’s (CBA) main policy instrument is the reserve requirement (RR),
which has been kept constant at 11 percent since January 2010 in light of adequate reserves,
deflation, and economic slack. Credit growth declined slightly to 4¼ percent in 2014 from 5 percent
in the previous year, and the banking system is awash with excess liquidity (6¾ percent of GDP in
2014), a reflection of anemic demand and lack of competition among banks.
18.
Commercial banks have weathered the double-dip recession without major strains. The
banking sector’s return on equity was 18½ percent in 2014, afforded by sizeable interest rate
margins which reflect, in part, an oligopolistic market structure (Box 4). The capital adequacy ratio
(CAR) has been on the rise since 2011 and exceeded 24 percent as of 2014, well above the regulatory
minimum of 14 percent. The non-performing loans (NPL) ratio declined to around 6 percent in 2014.
The authorities’ latest stress test results show that even under the most severe credit shock, the CAR
of the aggregate banking sector remained above the regulatory minimum. The CBA has widened the
supervisory umbrella to include insurance brokers in 2014. After significant efforts to enhance the
2

The CBA has three main capital account restrictions: (i) commercial banks are not allowed to hold a net negative
NFA position, and any foreign exchange in excess of a time-varying threshold need to be sold to the central bank;
(ii) institutional investors are obliged to invest at least 40 percent of the first Afl. 10 million of their liabilities locally, 50
percent of the second Afl. 10 million, and 60 percent of the remainder, and (iii) individuals as well as companies need
foreign exchange licenses for transactions above specific thresholds. In addition, Aruba levies a foreign exchange tax
(1.3 percent of the transactions value) on payments by residents to non-residents.

AML/CFT framework, Aruba was removed from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and Caribbean
FATF follow-up processes.
Staff’s views
19.
The current accommodative monetary policy stance remains justified given projected
low inflation and moderating growth rates, as well as evidence of slack in the economy.
Aruba’s foreign exchange reserves are currently adequate to safeguard the pegged exchange rate
regime. In case demand picks up and signs of overheating appear (such as rapid credit growth,
though this is a very low risk at this point), the authorities should stand ready to mop up the excess
liquidity by increasing the RR. Monetary tightening may also be warranted if gross international
reserves run the risk of dipping below any of the reserve adequacy thresholds monitored by the CBA.
Authorities’ views
20.
The authorities plan no near-term change in the monetary policy stance and are
contemplating moves to enhance policy transmission. Within the next year, the CBA is
considering an overnight facility to help manage excess banking system liquidity by providing
commercial banks with daily inter-bank rates. Relatedly, a new bank has been granted a license and
expected to begin operations by the end of the year, which should increase competition within the
sector. The authorities are planning on further strengthening their prudential framework by
broadening the supervisory perimeter to encompass securities trade.

C. Safeguarding Competitiveness and External Stability
Background
21.
Aruba appears to have sustained competitiveness in tourism. Its Caribbean market share
in stay-over tourism has continued to rise in tandem with growth in visitors’ nights (Figure 4). Aruba’s
reputation as a high-end destination and the predominance of time-share participants among repeat
stay-over visitors provide revenue stability. In addition, the authorities’ marketing efforts, access to
new U.S. hubs, and additional airlift capacity from South America have improved the tourism sectors’
resilience. Electricity costs do not appear to be out of line with its regional competitors.
22.
The real effective exchange rate has been on a depreciating trend since mid-2011.
Reflecting a narrow production base and the large need for imports that is typical to island
economies, the CA norm shows a sizeable deficit of 5½ percent of GDP. While the 2014 CA deficit
exceeds this norm by two percentage points, EBA-Lite estimates, which take Aruba’s very open
economy into account, suggest an overvaluation of 4 percent, that is, an exchange rate that is
broadly in line with fundamentals. The narrowing of the CA deficit over the medium-term is
projected to prevent a further deterioration of the net IIP position (–103 percent of GDP at end2014). However, stabilizing the net IIP position at such high levels and maintaining sizable CA
deficits, even if justified by fundamentals, poses both stability and financing risks.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

KINGDOM OF THE NETHERLANDS--ARUBA

23.
Structural competiveness portrays a more nuanced picture. Aruba’s labor market is highly
regulated with cumbersome lay-off procedures, including a lengthy (2-3 months) process for
obtaining a termination permit, which is often associated with hefty severance pay (based on years of
service and final salary) and court settlements favoring employees. Temporary workers can only be
hired through an agency for up to 12 months (after which they gain permanent status). A temporary
worker can only be rehired for the same position after a three-month pause. Costs of doing business
are high as establishing a new enterprise could take 4-6 months and involves complicated
procedures across multiple government entities. Obtaining the necessary licenses and permits seem
to be especially arduous in the construction and restaurant sectors. Banks impose fees for many
types of financial transactions, and it can sometimes take 2-4 months to open a bank account,
making access to finance and business operations costly and burdensome. To address some of these
issues, the Aruba Investment Agency (Arina), has been established to expedite the processing of
permits and licenses.
Staff’s views
24.
Improving price and structural competitiveness will strengthen the ongoing recovery.
While recent initiatives to diversify the tourism market are welcome, with the U.S. accounting for
around 55 percent of tourists, there is scope for further diversification. Increasing labor market
flexibility and reducing the costs of doing business would not only further improve Aruba’s
competitiveness, but would also help its adjustment to external shocks and facilitate diversification.
The authorities’ plans to set up a second windmill park will likely reduce utility costs, thereby
enhancing competitiveness.
Authorities’ views
25.
While the authorities generally agreed with staff’s analysis, they did not consider
structural competitiveness to be a major impediment. They highlighted many sources of strong
non-price competitiveness relative to their Caribbean peers including Aruba’s location, educated
population, high standards of living, safety and security, the Dutch legal system, and modern
infrastructure such as port facilities for cruise lines. Aruba is also one of the few countries in the
region where U.S. customs and border patrol offers clearance at the airport facilitating travel back to
the U.S. (recently expanded to include private aircraft). Relatedly, the authorities are working on
achieving EU/Schengen preclearance to ease travel to Europe.

BOOSTING LONG-TERM GROWTH POTENTIAL
Aruba needs to increase productivity and labor market participation to sustain growth
potential.
Background
26.
After a strong performance up to and throughout the 1990s, each major recession was
associated with structurally lower growth. Average real GDP growth exceeded 7 percent over
1987-2000. However, especially in the aftermath of the latest double-dip recession, Aruba’s growth

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

KINGDOM OF THE NETHERLANDS—ARUBA

trend decreased notably reflecting a structural decline in productivity. While many of its peers that
also rely heavily on the labor-intensive tourism sector have had similar experiences, Aruba stands out
in part because of the additional permanent productivity losses related to the closure of the oil
refinery. Taken together, estimates of Aruba’s potential growth rate therefore have decreased,
relative to pre-recession levels, to around 1½-1¾ percent.

Aruba faces several headwinds to longer-term growth. Absent new migration, Aruba’s
working age population is projected to decline, and at a pace faster than its peers—to 60 percent in
2040 from 70 percent in 2015. However, making up the shortfall via migration (which has also been
on a downtrend), is likely to pose pressures on the housing market and existing infrastructure.

The authorities are pursuing a new engine of growth centered around renewable
energy. Capitalizing on Aruba’s location and abundant solar and wind resources, the government of
Aruba’s vision includes: (i) making Aruba even more dependent on renewable energy (which would
reduce reliance on heavy fuel oil usage), (ii) transforming Aruba into a business platform between the
U.S., Latin America, and Europe, and (iii) promoting a knowledge-based economy. While renewable

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

KINGDOM OF THE NETHERLANDS--ARUBA

(primarily wind) currently supply around 17 percent of total energy needs, the planned second
windmill park could raise the share to around 35 percent. The Netherlands Organization for Applied
Scientific Research (TNO), with its Caribbean Branch Office in Aruba, is advancing research and
education focused on renewable energy technologies both locally and throughout the region.
Staff’s views
29.
The looming demographic challenges and declining productivity calls for labor market
action. Aruba needs a comprehensive labor market reform to increase both participation and
productivity. More effective targeting of social benefits could also increase the labor force
participation rate, while supporting ongoing fiscal consolidation efforts. But even with reforms, bleak
demographic prospects imply a need to rely on migrant workers, arguing for the development of
sustainable migration policies.
30.
Developing the renewable energy sector offers promising potential but is not without
challenges. Given Aruba’s natural resources, developing a capital- and technology-intensive
renewable energy sector offers the right long-term path for economic diversification. However,
skilled-labor shortages may pose a challenge to the success of this initiative. Given the likely upfront
investment needs of these initiatives, these projects should be financed through FDI as much as
possible.
Authorities’ views
31.
The authorities are confident about Aruba’s growth prospects from the renewable
energy sector. They emphasized that rather than a quantitative expansion of tourism, they are
deliberating pursuing a growth strategy focused on upgrading existing tourism facilities, improving
infrastructure, revitalizing urban spaces, and increasing dependence on renewable energy for
production to further improve the quality of Aruba as a destination. In addition, they view renewable
energy to play a catalytic role helping Aruba to grow into a business gateway to South America in
knowledge- and technology-intensive industries. The authorities pointed out that the Rocky
Mountain Institute recently joined efforts with the Carbon War Room to help achieve the goal to
become completely independent of fossil fuels by 2020 for electricity and potable water generation.
They anticipate that the share of renewable energy will increase to 40 percent in 2018, in part
supported by their recent partnership with Philips which through innovation will promote energy
efficiency. However, they acknowledged that scaling up wind energy substantially further presents
challenges, and are therefore researching storage technologies (flywheel and underwater
compressed air) to help ensure their renewable energy targets will be met. The authorities are also
cognizant of the skilled labor constraints, but see scope to bring back Aruban engineers working
abroad. They agreed with staff on the importance of financing through FDI.
32.
The authorities remain cautiously optimistic regarding the outcome of ongoing
offshore gas exploration. For the exploration, development, and production of oil and gas, the
government of Aruba signed a production sharing agreement with REPSOL which has recently
partnered with Total and BG Group. REPSOL’s initial interest was the result of its success in Venezuela

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

KINGDOM OF THE NETHERLANDS—ARUBA

where a large gas pocket was discovered. 3D seismological mapping in the continental seabed have
been concluded and subsequent analysis is currently underway. If gas reserves are found, production
would only begin in the long run.

STAFF APPRAISAL
33.
Aruba’s gradual recovery from the double-dip recession is underway. After a strong
initial tourism-led rebound, the economy lost momentum in part due to heightened fiscal policy
uncertainty. Looking ahead, a broad-based recovery underpinned by robust tourism activity, the
mainstay of the Aruban economy, and robust domestic demand is envisioned. However, real GDP is
projected to reach its pre-crisis peak only by the end of the decade.
34.
The main near-term risks to the outlook are external in nature. Given its high
dependence on tourism, the Aruban economy is vulnerable to spillovers associated with global
slowdowns. As they are the most important sources of tourists, Aruba is particularly susceptible to
downturns in the U.S. and Venezuela. Over the medium term, timely implementation of renewable
energy investments could boost growth prospects.
35.
Putting debt on a downward trajectory is an immediate policy priority. Although major
structural reforms have been initiated, public debt surpassed 80 percent of GDP in 2014. Attributes
such as Aruba’s vulnerability to external shocks, the predominance of the tourism sector, and the
exchange rate peg call for the urgent rebuilding of fiscal policy space. While the authorities’
ambitious medium-term adjustment plan is welcome, sustained fiscal effort at least until 2020 is
warranted to durably set debt on a downward path. There is a need to establish a formal mediumterm fiscal framework to enhance the credibility of these plans.
36.
Additional revenue and expenditure measures are needed to achieve the desired fiscal
consolidation. Without additional measures, fiscal deficits would remain elevated, and debt would
continue to rise over the medium term. Therefore, given the size of the fiscal adjustment, additional
revenue effort in the form of greater indirect tax collection appears warranted. With regards to
expenditure, a priority is to reduce wage-related expenses given the large size of the wage bill.
Further measures to ensure that the health care system becomes self-financing should also be
considered. PPP-related expenditure commitments should be fully accounted for.
37.
The accommodative monetary policy stance is appropriate. Given projected low inflation
and moderating growth rates, as well as evidence of slack in the economy, staff currently sees no
need for monetary tightening. If, however, signs of overheating appear, the authorities should stand
ready to tighten the monetary policy stance appropriately.
38.
Competitiveness needs to be safeguarded to ensure a stable recovery. Initiatives to
diversify markets and efforts to promote Aruba’s reputation as an upscale destination have
continued to reap dividends as evidenced by the uptrend in visitor nights and Aruba’s growing share
in the Caribbean tourism market. Given that the U.S. accounts for 55 percent of tourists, however,

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

KINGDOM OF THE NETHERLANDS--ARUBA

staff sees further scope for market diversification. To further improve competitiveness and preserve
external stability, Aruba would need greater flexibility in the labor market and more enabling
business conditions. It will be important to finance prospective growth initiatives, including those
associated with renewable energy, through FDI.
39.
It is envisaged that the next Article IV consultation discussions with Aruba will be held
on a 24-month cycle.

Box 1. Aruba: Basic Facts
Aruba is a small Caribbean island 29 kilometers off the northern coast of Venezuela. The 180 square
kilometer island is densely populated, inhabited by 106,795 persons (2013). Unlike many other Caribbean
islands, Aruba is situated outside of the hurricane belt, benefitting from consistently sunny skies, prevailing
cooling trade winds, and a constant temperature (27˚C), which along with its world renowned beaches,
makes it a popular vacation destination all year round.
After being granted status aparte in 1986, Aruba became an autonomous country within the Kingdom of the
Netherlands (together with Curaçao, Sint Maarten, and the Netherlands itself). The political system is based
on the Dutch model with some English common law influence. Prime Minister Eman, is serving his second
four-year term in office with a 13 out of 21 seat majority in the Parliament; next elections are due in 2017.
Aruba has one of the highest standards of living in the Caribbean with GDP per capita at $24,429 in 2013.
Aruba’s currency, the florin (AWG or AFL), has been pegged to the US dollar since 1971 (1.79 Afl. to the
dollar). The economy is largely dependent on tourism which directly and indirectly accounts for about 85
percent of GDP, with most visitors coming from the United States, Venezuela, and Canada. The Valero oil
refinery closed in 2012, leading to a significant loss of output (of around 8 percent of GDP).

Box 2. Aruba: The Impact of External Spillovers
As with other small open island economies, Aruba is highly sensitive to global economic conditions. In
particular, Aruban growth is one of the most volatile in the region, with external factors accounting for
almost 60 percent of its growth volatility.

Box 3. Aruba: Reform of Entitlement Programs
In 2014, the authorities took significant steps towards restoring the sustainability of their pension and health
care systems.
The pension system reform consisted of two elements:

First, the authorities aimed to stem the losses of the general (AOV) pension fund, as well as to build
a legal reserve that would safeguard its sustainability. To achieve this, reforms were implemented in steps.
On January 1, 2014, premium income limits increased from Afl. 65,052 to Afl. 85,000, and premium rates
increased from 12½ to 13½ percent. On January 1, 2015 premium rates increased further to 14½ percent,
and the minimum retirement age began a process of increasing to 65 from 60 years in six-month increments
over 10 years. With these reforms, after sizeable initial savings, premiums are expected to fully cover costs
beginning in 2017.

Second, the authorities sought to restore the sustainability of the public administration (APFA)
pension system. Pension limits, premiums, and the retirement age were raised in line with the AOV reforms.
In 2014, the government also signed a loan agreement with the APFA pension fund to repay the bulk of its
long-standing debt to the pension fund over 5 years adding 3½ percent of GDP to the public debt stock but
restoring APFA’s long-term sustainability.
To reform the health system (AZV), a 1 percent levy was introduced to limit its fiscal drain. While the levy will
help offset health expenses, in the absence of further measures, overall health care costs are expected to
rise, in part owing to an ageing population.

Box 4. Aruba: Overview of the Financial System
Aruba’s financial sector is sizeable with assets of about 210 percent of GDP in 2014. Commercial banks
dominate the sector with nearly half of total assets. The rest of the financial system is divided among
pension funds, insurance companies, and bank-like institutions.
The four commercial banks are foreign owned subsidiaries of (parent) banks located in Curaçao. Hence, they
are supervised by both the Central Bank of Aruba (CBA) and by the Central Bank of Curaçao and St. Maarten.
The banks are largely funded by resident deposits, which account for over 80 percent of liabilities. More than
60 percent of banks’ assets are loans to the private sector. They also invest in government securities. Aruba
also has two off shore banks with assets of 7 percent of GDP, which are only engaged in banking activities
with non-residents. After banks, pension funds form the next largest component of the financial sector,
dominated by the civil service pension fund (APFA), which has assets of over 50 percent of GDP.
Aruba’s financial system differs in key respects with those in the region: (i) the size of its financial sector,
including its banks, is notably smaller

Appendix I. Public Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA)
Significant vulnerability and risks: Given a sizable debt burden and gross financing needs, the Public
DSA framework for Market-Access Countries indicates that debt dynamics continue to depend on
additional growth-supporting structural effort over the medium term and remain highly vulnerable to
adverse, and even relatively mild, macro-fiscal and contingent liabilities shocks. While staff’s baseline
projections reflect the authorities’ current fiscal policies with no new measures, additional consolidation
in 2015-2020 remains necessary to place debt on a downward path.

A.

Baseline Scenario

1.
Debt is expected to continue increasing in 2015 and beyond, although at a slower pace
(Figure 1). The debt ratio is now projected to reach 90.6 percent of GDP by 2020, without further
consolidation efforts. The baseline debt projections reflect important debt consolidation efforts in
2014-15, but do not incorporate the gains of unspecified measures over the medium-term. The debt
projections also highlight the high sensitivity of Aruba’s debt dynamics to macro shocks. Aruba’s
debt net of government deposits is projected to stand at around 81.6 percent of GDP at end–2014.

B.

Risk Assessment

2.
Aruba’s sizable debt burden and gross financing needs continue to pose significant
risks to debt sustainability. As presented in Figure 1, Aruba’s debt ratio significantly exceeds the
debt burden benchmark for emerging market economies of 60 percent of GDP already under the
baseline scenario. The same applies to Aruba’s public financing needs which are significantly above
the relevant benchmark of 15 percent of GDP. However, the debt profile is subject to medium to low
risks in terms of bond spreads, projected change in short-term debt, and the share of public debt
held in foreign currency.

C.

Realism of Baseline Assumptions

3.
The baseline assumptions are consistent with past economic performance. Specifically,
staff assumes that the structural measures already committed in 2014 are implemented and that in
line with past experience, Aruba would grow about 1¾ percent over the medium term.
4.
Given Aruba’s sizable debt burden and financing needs, the primary deficit is expected
to exceed its debt-stabilizing threshold over the projection period. Under staff’s baseline
scenario, the fiscal primary balance is expected to turn to a surplus in 2016.

1/ Public sector is defined as central government.
2/ Based on available data.
3/ Long-term bond spread over German bonds.
4/ Defined as interest payments divided by debt stock (excluding guarantees) at the end of previous year.
5/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;
a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
6/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
7/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as ae(1+r).
8/ Includes asset changes and interest revenues (if any). For projections, includes exchange rate changes during the projection period.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

Downside: Protracted period of slower
growth in advanced and emerging
economies:
• Advanced economies : Lower-thananticipated potential growth and persistently
low inflation from a failure to fully address
crisis legacies, leading to secular stagnation
and lower commodity prices.
• Emerging markets : Maturing of the cycle,
misallocation of investment, and incomplete
structural reforms leading to prolonged
slower growth.

High
Aruba’s tourism and

US. Developments in
Venezuela, given its close
proximity and tight trade
links, also matter for
Aruba’s economy.

• Strengthen fiscal

Downside : Geopolitical fragmentation that
erodes the globalization process and fosters
inefficiency:
• Russia/Ukraine: sustained tensions
depress business confidence and heighten
risk aversion, amid disturbances in global
financial, trade and commodity markets.
• Heightened risk of fragmentation/state
failure in the Middle East, leading to a sharp
rise in oil prices, with negative spillovers to
the global economy.

Note: The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to
materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks
surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30
percent, and “high” a probability between 30 and 50 percent). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of the risks and
overall level of concern as of the time of the discussion with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and
materialize jointly.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Kingdom of the Netherlands - Aruba —STATISTICAL ISSUES APPENDIX
(As of March 9, 2015)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is adequate for surveillance.
National Accounts: GDP at current prices by the production and expenditure approaches are
compiled by the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS). GDP at constant prices is estimated and
disseminated by the Central Bank of Aruba (CBA). Both set of statistics are available on an annual
basis up to 2013. On the expenditure side, changes in inventories are included in capital formation.
Moreover, the data on imports and exports of goods and services do not match BOP statistics,
reflecting different methodological approaches and raw data sources.
Price Statistics: CPI data are compiled and published on a monthly basis by the CBS.
Government Finance Statistics: Government finance statistics are prepared and published on a
regular basis, but not directly reported to STA. The presentation of the fiscal accounts could be
improved in several respects. First, the residual expenditure category “items not identified
elsewhere” (that can amount to 3 percent of GDP) should be disaggregated. Second, below-the-line
financing does not add up to the fiscal deficit without further adjustments. Third, each financing
category has a component “other financial transactions” (in addition to disbursements and
amortizations) that should be clarified. Fourth, the authorities combine commercial bank financing
and central bank financing into one aggregate category “net recourse to the monetary system”. This
item should be disaggregated. Finally, the authorities should reflect the revenue from the AZV levy
and record the transfer of those proceeds to the AZV as the corresponding expense. This would
enhance transparency related to government expenditures on health care.
Monetary and Financial Statistics: The methodology used by the CBA for compiling monetary
statistics published in CBA’s Monthly Bulletin, Quarterly Bulletin, and Annual Statistical Digest is
broadly consistent with the IMF’s Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual 2000 (MFSM). The CBA
reports monetary data to STA on a timely basis. The authorities submit the data in the format of
Standardized Report Forms developed by STA. Aruba does not report FSIs for dissemination on the
FSI Portal.
External Sector Statistics: The CBA reports quarterly balance of payments and an annual
international investment position (IIP) statistics to STA. Aruba participates in the Coordinated Direct
Investment Survey (CDIS) and the Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS). Monthly data on
the official reserve position are published with a lag of one month. A breakdown in holdings of gold
and foreign exchange is provided. Aruba does not participate in the World Bank’s Quarterly External
Debt Statistics (QEDS) database; however, it disseminates annual data on gross external debt
position by sector—including a breakdown by maturity and instrument— in its Annual Statistical
Digest. A debt survey covering both public and private sectors provides information on the amount,
currency denomination of foreign debt outstanding, as well as on disaggregation by instrument and
amortization payments coming due.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Aruba does not participant in the Fund’s GDDS.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2015 Article IV Consultation with the
Kingdom of the Netherlands—Aruba
On April 8, 2015, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
2015 Article IV consultation1 with the Kingdom of the Netherlands—Aruba, and considered and
endorsed the staff appraisal without a meeting.2
Aruba is a small, open economy with one of the highest living standards in the Caribbean. Over
85 percent of the economy depends on tourism, making Aruba the third-most tourism-dependent
country in the world. This marked dependence on external economic conditions is a key reason
why Aruban growth volatility has been among the highest in the region. However, the longstanding fixed exchange rate regime against the US dollar, supported by prudent policies, has
kept imbalances in check until recent years.
Aruba has been recovering from a severe double-dip recession. The economy faced two major
shocks over the past five years: the global financial crisis and shutdown of the Valero oil refinery
in 2012. After a strong recovery in 2013 with growth reaching 4.75 percent, the pace of activity
moderated in 2014. Despite a rebound in tourism, the loss in momentum reflected a broad-based
contraction in domestic demand due to fiscal policy uncertainty and investment delays.
Although external imbalances have improved recently, they remain elevated. The current
account (CA) deficit is estimated to have narrowed to 7.5 percent of GDP in 2014, mostly
reflecting strong tourism growth. External debt decreased to 105 percent of GDP and roll-over
risks are mitigated as 90 percent of the debt is long term.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board
2

The Executive Board takes decisions under its lapse-of-time procedure when the Board agrees that a proposal can
be considered without convening formal discussions.

2
After worsening sharply over 2008-2012, the fiscal deficit narrowed to 5.25 percent of GDP in
2014. In particular, the overall fiscal balance deteriorated markedly by 11 percentage points of
GDP over 2008-2012, reflecting the reduction in the business turnover tax (BBO), increasing
wage-related expenditures, and a structural decline in output growth. To address these fiscal
challenges, the authorities undertook major entitlement reforms in 2014. Specifically, the general
(AOV) and public administration (APFA) pensions as well as the health care system (AZV) were
all reformed. While these reforms, together with expenditure restraint, yield important savings,
public debt nonetheless surpassed 80 percent of GDP in 2014.
In 2015, growth is projected to rise to 2.25 percent. The tourism sector—the mainstay of the
Aruban economy—is envisaged to grow, albeit at a slower rate. Moreover, domestic demand is
slated to recover notably amid subsiding policy uncertainty and as key public-private partnership
projects move forward. Despite lower global oil prices, the energy tariff increase and the
introduction of the health-care levy in late 2014, is expected to raise the inflation rate to .75
percent in 2015. Although the CA balance is projected to register a deficit, buoyant tourism
exports would help reduce its size to –3.5 percent of GDP in 2015.
Executive Board Assessment
In concluding the 2015 Article IV consultation discussions with the Kingdom of the
Netherlands—Aruba, Executive Directors endorsed the staff’s appraisal as follows:
Aruba’s gradual recovery from the double-dip recession is underway. After a strong initial
tourism-led rebound, the economy lost momentum in part due to heightened fiscal policy
uncertainty. Looking ahead, a broad-based recovery underpinned by robust tourism activity, the
mainstay of the Aruban economy, and robust domestic demand is envisioned. However, real
GDP is projected to reach its pre-crisis peak only by the end of the decade.
The main near-term risks to the outlook are external in nature. Given its high dependence on
tourism, the Aruban economy is vulnerable to spillovers associated with global slowdowns. As
they are the most important sources of tourists, Aruba is particularly susceptible to downturns in
the U.S. and Venezuela. Over the medium term, timely implementation of renewable energy
investments could boost growth prospects.
Putting debt on a downward trajectory is an immediate policy priority. Although major structural
reforms have been initiated, public debt surpassed 80 percent of GDP in 2014. Attributes such as
Aruba’s vulnerability to external shocks, the predominance of the tourism sector, and the
exchange rate peg call for the urgent rebuilding of fiscal policy space. While the authorities’
ambitious medium-term adjustment plan is welcome, sustained fiscal effort at least until 2020 is
warranted to durably set debt on a downward path. There is a need to establish a formal mediumterm fiscal framework to enhance the credibility of these plans.

3
Additional revenue and expenditure measures are needed to achieve the desired fiscal
consolidation. Without additional measures, fiscal deficits would remain elevated, and debt
would continue to rise over the medium term. Therefore, given the size of the fiscal adjustment,
additional revenue effort in the form of greater indirect tax collection appears warranted. With
regards to expenditure, a priority is to reduce wage-related expenses given the large size of the
wage bill. Further measures to ensure that the health care system becomes self-financing should
also be considered. PPP-related expenditure commitments should be fully accounted for.
The accommodative monetary policy stance is appropriate. Given projected low inflation and
moderating growth rates, as well as evidence of slack in the economy, staff currently sees no
need for monetary tightening. If, however, signs of overheating appear, the authorities should
stand ready to tighten the monetary policy stance appropriately.
Competitiveness needs to be safeguarded to ensure a stable recovery. Initiatives to diversify
markets and efforts to promote Aruba’s reputation as an upscale destination have continued to
reap dividends as evidenced by the uptrend in visitor nights and Aruba’s growing share in the
Caribbean tourism market. Given that the U.S. accounts for 55 percent of tourists, however, staff
sees further scope for market diversification. To further improve competitiveness and preserve
external stability, Aruba would need greater flexibility in the labor market and more enabling
business conditions. It will be important to finance prospective growth initiatives, including
those associated with renewable energy, through FDI.
