CÔTE D’IVOIRE
Staff Report for the 2011 Article IV Consultation and Requests for a Three-Year
Arrangement Under the Extended Credit Facility and for Additional Interim
Assistance Under the Enhanced Initiative for Heavily Indebted Poor Countries
Prepared by the African Department
(In consultation with other departments)
Approved by Roger Nord and Thomas Dorsey
October 20, 2011
Background: Côte d’Ivoire is recovering from a prolonged sociopolitical crisis, which
culminated in the ousting of former President Gbagbo. After the end of the post-election
crisis in April 2011, President Ouattara embarked on an ambitious investment-led recovery
and development program that would take the country beyond the HIPC Completion Point on
the path to sustained growth and poverty reduction. In the short term, the security situation
remains fragile despite advances in recent months. Parliamentary elections announced for
December 2011 should complete the political cycle and help rebuild confidence and social
peace. Côte d’Ivoire is a member of the West African Economic and Monetary Union
(WAEMU); its currency, the CFA franc, is pegged to the euro. It has accepted the obligations
under Article VIII and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on payments and
transfers for current international transactions.
Program issues: Performance under the RCF-supported program has been good. The
authorities have requested an arrangement under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) in an
amount equivalent to SDR 390.24 million (120 percent of quota), and a third allocation of
interim HIPC assistance of SDR 5.042 million.
Mission: The staff team comprising Ms. Ross (head), Messrs. Ahokpossi and Koulet-Vickot
(all AFR), Dicks-Mireaux (SPR), Thakoor (FAD), and Camard (Res. Rep.) visited Abidjan
during August 31–September 15, 2011. The mission held discussions with Prime Minister
Soro, Ministers Diby (Finance and Economy), Mabri (Planning and Development), Kone
(Social Affairs), Toungara (Energy and Mines), Banzio (Commerce), Dosso (Industry),
Coulibaly (Agriculture), Achi (Infrastructure), Jeannot (Justice), Gnamien (Civil Service)
and Koffi (Defense), National Director of the regional central bank Aman, other senior
officials, representatives of the private sector, civil society, and the diplomatic community.
Mr. Allé (OED) attended some of the meetings.
Publication: The authorities agreed to the publication of the staff report, Letter of Intent, and
Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY


The Ivoirien economy is recovering quickly from the impact of the post-election
crisis, and considerable strides have been made in restoring security. But challenges
remain, notably to strengthen security throughout the country, to solidify social and
political stability, and to transition to a robust growth path.



Performance under the RCF-supported program has been good, with most targets
either met or exceeded. Fiscal policy has supported the recovery and addressed
post-crisis humanitarian needs, while rebuilding public services. Conservative budget
management has kept spending in line with available resources. In addition, the
preparation of a medium-term structural reform was started, external arrears to
multilateral institutions were cleared and progress has been made to regularize relations
with other external creditors.



The authorities’ medium-term priorities are to achieve high sustained growth,
reduce poverty, and restore a sustainable fiscal and external position. To achieve
this, it will be essential to implement structural reforms to improve governance, the
business climate, reduce vulnerabilities in the financial system, and strengthen
competitiveness. Fiscal space is needed for pro-poor and investment spending and debt
restructuring should be carried forward. These goals and policies reflect the country’s
poverty reduction strategy, form the basis of the authorities’ medium-term program, and
will also contribute to the external stability of the WAEMU.



The authorities request IMF support under the ECF and HIPC Initiative to support
their medium-term program. The program’s objectives are in line with the authorities’
priorities: fiscal policy aims to expand the tax base, strengthen revenue administration,
shift expenditure in favor of investment and pro-poor spending while strengthening
public financial management and implementing civil service reform; and structural
reforms focus on improving governance and efficiency in the energy and coffee/cocoa
sectors, financial sector reform, and measures to improve the business climate and
support private investment.



There are risks to the program, but the economy’s potential together with successful
implementation of the authorities’ program could yield strong sustainable growth.
Key risks to the outlook are a lack of decisive improvements in the security situation and
in political normalization, an inability to implement much-needed structural reforms, or
to access to the regional financial markets, external shocks, but there could also be a
stronger-than-expected rebound in economic activity. Overall, the strong performance of
the economy since May 2011 and the authorities’ commitment to their medium-term
policy agenda bode well.

6
I. EMERGING FROM THE SOCIOPOLITICAL CRISIS
1.
Coming out of the post-election crisis, Côte d’Ivoire has embarked
MEFP ¶2
swiftly on the road to economic recovery and political normalization,
although many challenges remain. Progress is underway in the reunification of the country
through the formation of new security forces, including the hiring of some 11,000 of former
opposition fighters, and the redeployment of government agencies and staff to the
Center-North-West regions that had been controlled by the Forces Nouvelles rebels since
2002. The security situation has improved significantly since May, but further progress is
needed, particularly in the west of the country. Parliamentary elections announced for
December 11, 2011 should complete the political cycle and help rebuild confidence. A Truth
and Reconciliation Commission has been set up to further reconciliation and social cohesion.
II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
2.
Performance under the RCF-supported program has been good with
MEFP ¶6
economic activity recovering faster than expected and inflation abating from
its April peak. The projected decline in real GDP for 2011 was reduced in September from
-6.3 to -5.8 percent with further upside potential (Tables 1–3, Figures 1–2). This reflects
mainly stronger agricultural production and mining output, and the recovery of industrial
production in July to just 2 percent below its level a year earlier, as against about 50 percent
in April. Trade has picked up quickly after the end of the EU embargo. Annual inflation fell
from over 9 percent at the peak of the crisis to 4½ percent in June–August.

Budget execution through July was largely in line with the
MEFP ¶7–9
RCF-supported program. Revenue exceeded the June target, while
spending was low, including pro-poor spending, as the 2011 budget only became operational
in July. All other indicative targets for June were met except domestic financing that
substituted in June for an expected foreign disbursement delayed to early July (Text table 1,
Tables 4–5).
Box 1: Domestic Currency Debt Operations
Côte d’Ivoire’s total domestic currency debt at end-June 2011 is estimated at about 14.5 percent of
GDP. The bulk is owed to investors in the regional securities market (60 percent) and the BCEAO1
(25 percent). One third of short-term securities are held by banks in Côte d’Ivoire, the rest mainly
by banks in the region.

With the onset of the post-election crisis in December 2010, regular auctions of Treasury securities
were no longer possible because of uncertainty as to who constituted the legal government. In order
to limit the impact on the regional banking system, it was agreed that the BCEAO would roll over
maturing Ivoirien T-bills (maturities up to one year), which is still the case through October 2011.
The government has initiated discussions to exit from this renewal. It proposed a plan to banks in
Côte d’Ivoire to restructure the stock of short-term paper (CFAF 600 billion at interest rates of
5.1 to 6.4 percent) in October 2011 into 2-year T-bills, and 3- and 5-year bonds (at somewhat lower
interest rates) while accumulated interest (CFAF 20 billion) would be paid in cash. A road show to
the region is underway, and the authorities [asked] the BCEAO on an exceptional basis to enhance
these new securities by admission for refinancing and for required reserves.
Despite the ongoing roll-over of T-bills, Côte d’Ivoire has been able to return to the regional market
with longer maturities. In September 2011 the authorities launched a new 5-year bond, rolling over
a maturing bond (CFAF 61 billion) and raising new money (CFAF 99 billion, equivalent to
0.9 percent of GDP).
1

The debt to the BCEAO corresponds mostly to the outstanding of consolidated statutory advances and the
loans linked to the SDR allocation.

11
4.
The government continued the rollover of Treasury bills through October as it feared
a lack of demand for voluntary placements. It discussed a restructuring of the stock of T-bills
with commercial banks that is to be completed in October (see Box 1). In the event, the
authorities successfully launched a new 5-year bond in September.
5.
Banks’ portfolio quality has weakened and credit extension remains subdued
despite the sizeable financing needs of enterprises. Nonperforming loan ratios, which had
improved gradually in recent years, deteriorated significantly in the first half of 2011 (Table 6)
reflecting the impact of the post-election crisis on small- and medium-size enterprises (SMEs).
The difficult financial situation of the public banks, which remained open during the crisis, was
aggravated further and the authorities have replaced management in these 5 institutions as a first
step toward containing losses and designing a restructuring strategy in cooperation with the
regional Banking Commission.
III. OUTLOOK AND KEY CHALLENGES—MOVING FROM RECOVERY
TO SUSTAINED GROWTH
6.
Policy discussions for the Article IV consultation focused on the
MEFP ¶4, 10–11
challenges of achieving high and sustained growth over the medium
term, reducing poverty and restoring a sustainable fiscal and external position. The
authorities’ priorities for the medium term, with which the staff agreed, form the basis of their
program to be supported by a new 3-year ECF arrangement. The authorities emphasized the
need for stronger growth to translate into greater employment opportunities, especially for the
youth. Their priorities are to:


Implement structural reforms to remove impediments to growth, improve governance
and the business climate, and create employment opportunities. The focus is on
reforming the coffee/cocoa sector so as to improve productivity and farm incomes;
restoring the viability of the electricity sector and enlarging generating capacity to
accommodate the demands of a growing economy; strengthening the judicial system;
and facilitating business services for trade and new start-ups. PFM reforms are
continuing, and governance in the public administration and enterprises is being
strengthened.



Create fiscal space for pro-poor and investment spending, particularly in
infrastructure, which has been neglected during the crisis years. HIPC debt relief, a
sustainable wage bill, a reduction in subsidies, and containment of other current outlays
are essential to target priorities and making spending more efficient. Together with
renewed efforts to broaden the revenue base, a better mastery of current spending will be
key to achieving a sustainable fiscal position over the medium term.



Reduce vulnerabilities in the financial system. This will include strengthening the
pension funds and limiting their losses, restructuring the public banks, and defining a

12
clear role for the government in the sector, in order to improve financial intermediation
and provide support for investment and growth.


Carry forward the debt restructuring process. Early completion of HIPC/MDRI and
other debt relief would significantly improve Côte d’Ivoire’s debt sustainability.



Strengthen competitiveness. Here as well, the planned structural reforms are essential to
diversify the economy and reduce the vulnerability of exports to commodity price
swings and the projected medium-term terms-of-trade decline.

7.
The authorities are planning to update the PRSP (2009–13) following
MEFP ¶4
broad-based consultations. A progress report covering 2010–11 is to be
prepared by early 2012. A new National Development Plan will cover 2012–15. Also, the
Public Investment Program is being updated to enable the absorption of resources that will
become available after the HIPC Completion Point.1
A. Growth and Poverty Reduction: the Medium-Term Macroeconomic
Framework and Outlook
8.
Many of the recommendations of the 2009 Article IV
MEFP ¶12–16
discussions remain relevant. While the initial implementation of the 2009
ECF-supported program was broadly satisfactory and in line with the staff recommendations,
structural reforms stalled in 2010 and the crisis reversed some of the reforms and some of the
macroeconomic progress that had already been achieved.
9.
The medium-term objectives of the macroeconomic framework underlying the
PRSP and the last ECF-supported program remain appropriate. With the political crisis
overcome, real growth is expected to bounce back to 8–9 percent in 2012, in part reflecting base
effects, but also a strengthening of confidence with the completion of the election cycle,
political normalization, and progress toward the sizeable debt relief associated with the HIPC
Completion Point. Reflecting higher investment, growth is projected to remain strong at around
6 percent over the medium term as the economy is rebuilt after a decade of conflict-induced
stagnation. Inflation is expected to fall back to the WAEMU’s medium-term target of 3 percent.
10.
The baseline scenario assumes an increase in investment, both public and private,
from its low overall levels of 8.7 percent of GDP during 2009–11 to about 13.9 percent of
GDP in 2012–14. Substantially higher investment is expected to boost construction and
transport activities, and turn the crisis-years’ surplus in the external current account into a
deficit that could be financed by foreign direct investment and new borrowing.
1

After the HIPC Completion Point, additional bilateral debt relief of €2 billion is to be provided by France over
time under the Contrats de Désendettement et de Développement (C2D) scheme, essentially a
debt-for-development swap.

13
11.
The fiscal strategy over the medium term should achieve sustainability and enable
higher investment by strengthening revenue collection as well as containing and
reprioritizing other expenditure. The overall budget deficit is expected to decline to around
3 percent of GDP, and the basic primary balance2 should recover from its deficit spike in 2011
to a small surplus over the medium term.
12.
There are risks to the outlook, but the economy’s potential and determined
reforms could yield strong results. A lack of continued clear improvements in the security
situation and in political normalization would dampen private activity and investment; a lack of
progress in restoring energy and transport infrastructure would impede the projected
acceleration of economic activity; and external shocks, e.g., a large terms-of-trade loss, would
endanger the achievement of external sustainability. At the same time, further positive surprises
are possible: uncertainties over the pace of the recovery in coming months remain high, and the
pick-up in activity in 2012 and beyond could be stronger or earlier than currently projected.
Clearly the economy’s potential and a successful implementation of the authorities’ program
could yield strong sustainable growth and attract much new investment.
B. Competitiveness and the Business Climate
13.
The competitiveness of the Ivoirien economy needs to be strengthened. The
analysis of the last Article IV discussions on this issue still remains valid.3 While there is no
sign of real effective exchange rate misalignment for Côte d’Ivoire (Box 2), in line with the
regional WAEMU real exchange rate assessment,4 other indicators of competitiveness highlight
the need to remedy structural deficiencies and improve the business climate. Over the last
decade, governance worsened and corruption is a widespread impediment. Lack of maintenance
and investment has worn down the existing infrastructure, and the degradation of roads (and the
railway) and the proliferation of roadblocks in recent years added to the cost of transportation
and weakened competitiveness. The electricity sector remains vulnerable to shocks that would
be disruptive of economic activity, as seen during the electricity crisis of early 2010. The
judicial system, and contract enforcement in particular, is weak. As a result, banks are reluctant
to lend to SMEs, which account for the bulk of urban employment.
14.
The authorities shared the staff’s analysis and are determined
MEFP ¶25–40
to accelerate structural reforms and improve the business climate.
Their structural reform plans are extensive, from measures to improve economic governance
and a reform of public enterprises to reforms of the land register and the judicial system, a new
investment code and competition law, a one-stop window for trade formalities and a center to
facilitate business start-ups.

The basic primary balance is defined as total revenue (excluding grants) less expenditure net of scheduled interest
and foreign-financed capital expenditure.

Box 2: Assessing External Competitiveness in Côte d’Ivoire
Côte d’Ivoire’s real effective exchange rate (REER) has steadily appreciated since the 1994
devaluation, although in 2010 it depreciated by about 6 percent as a result of the decline of the Euro
(to which the CFAF is pegged) vis-à-vis the currencies of Côte d’Ivoire’s major trading partners,
most notably the U.S. dollar.
Nevertheless, quantitative estimates of Côte d’Ivoire’s real effective exchange rate, based on the three
CGER methodologies—macroeconomic balance (MB), external sustainability (ES), and equilibrium
real effective exchange rate (EREER)—indicate its REER is broadly in line with economic
fundamentals. This finding is similar to the real exchange rate assessment conducted for the 2011
1
Article IV consultation for the WAEMU region.

Nevertheless, competitiveness, export growth and diversification has been held back by structural
factors, in particular a poor business environment, as cited in many of the staff’s discussions with the
private business sector. Nonprice indicators rank the competitiveness of Ivoirien economy as low
relative to the SSA average and that of the WAEMU countries, and worsened over the past year
partly owing to the recent crisis. The World Bank’s survey-based “Doing Business Index” for 2011
shows a deterioration in Côte d’Ivoire’s ranking from 168 to 169 (183 equals the worst possible
ranking and 1 the best), mostly owing to the decline in the ease of registering property, which also
affects a business’ ability to borrow. For comparison, other WAEMU countries ranked between 151
for Burkina Faso and 176 for Guinea-Bissau; 23 SSA countries, or about half of the total, were
among the 32 lowest-ranked countries in the survey. According to the World Bank Enterprise Survey
(2009), most Ivoirien firms surveyed identified access to finance and political instability as major
constraints to business activity.

15.
The authorities plan to contribute to regional integration within the
MEFP ¶41
WAEMU and ECOWAS, which should give impetus to regional trade and
open up new markets. Following agreement amongst member countries, a fifth tariff band
(35 percent) is to be added to the existing 4 bands (0, 5, 10 and 20 percent) of the ECOWAS
common external tariff, in order to offer temporary protection to selected industrial products.
Discussions have made little progress on defining the coverage of products within each band.
A regional interim Partnership Agreement with the European Union and accompanying
development program have not been signed yet. In anticipation of an eventual agreement, the
authorities will pursue a fiscal transition away from trade and toward domestic taxation
within the context of regional policies. In addition, the authorities are seeking eligibility to
AGOA trade preferences with a target date of 2012.
C. Reducing Financial Sector Vulnerabilities
16.
The post-election crisis has aggravated the vulnerabilities of the financial
sector brought out in the 2009 FSAP.5 Bank portfolios have weakened, especially for
smaller banks more exposed to SMEs, which bore the brunt of the destruction and looting
during the crisis. While the Banking Commission is still analyzing the results of banks’
self-assessment, it is expected that several banks need recapitalization or guarantees to meet
prudential norms. The underlying problems of the five state-owned banks have worsened;
most of these banks are relatively small and were the only banks that remained open during
the height of the crisis in February–April 2011. The insurance and pension sectors need
major reforms to ensure the financial viability.
17.
The authorities have resumed preparations for a comprehensive financial
sector reform strategy to reduce these vulnerabilities, with the technical assistance of
the IMF and the World Bank. This includes defining the government’s role in the sector,
restructuring loss-making public banks, broadening access to financial services, reforming
microfinance institutions, and improving the viability of the pension funds. In recent months,
some banks have obtained support from various partners, including the French Development
Agency (AFD),6 in the form of guarantees for credit to SMEs.
D. Debt restructuring and sustainability
18.
Restoring debt sustainability is important to improve growth prospects and
will require continued prudent fiscal and borrowing policies, debt relief and
concessional donor support. The updated LIC DSA7 shows that while Côte d’Ivoire is
currently in debt distress, the debt relief at the Completion Point would achieve debt
sustainability, while creating scope for the significant new borrowing envisaged. Debt
service payments are projected to increase after the Completion Point from their current
(exceptionally low) levels. Following approval of a new ECF arrangement, the authorities

Discussions on International Finance Corporation (IFC) support are still ongoing.

See www.imf.org

16
intend to seek a rescheduling from Paris Club creditors, Eurobond holders,8 and other
external official bilateral and commercial creditors, and have initiated discussions to that end.
19.
The HIPC Completion Point (CP) is likely to slip beyond
MEFP Box 1
mid-2012 as the reform of the coffee/cocoa sector has not advanced
quickly enough. Discussions are ongoing and consultations with stakeholders will take time.
The adoption of a new sector strategy and its implementation for 6 months is a CP trigger.
Progress on other triggers is more advanced.
20.
The authorities agreed with the staff that strengthening debt management is a
priority, both in light of the crisis experience that resulted in the need for a
restructuring of the stock of T-bills and in preparation for post-CP financing needs. The
country’s debt management capacity is low and weaknesses have been evident repeatedly.
Identifying the optimal mix of regional and external financing options for its investment
plans and other financing needs will be a challenge. Staff encouraged the authorities to
develop a debt strategy and improve debt management in order to take full advantage of
domestic resources freed up and the space opened up for new borrowing after the CP. In the
meantime, the authorities have requested technical assistance from the IMF and World Bank
to formulate a comprehensive debt management strategy. They intend to set up a national
debt agency in line with WAEMU guidelines.
IV. DISCUSSIONS FOR A NEW ECF-SUPPORTED PROGRAM
A. Fiscal Policy
21.
The authorities and staff agreed that the objective of the fiscal policy over the
medium term is to create fiscal space for an increase in pro-poor and public investment
outlays, while establishing fiscal and debt sustainability. For the period April–December
2011, an overall budget deficit of 8.1 percent of period GDP is now projected, slightly lower
than under the RCF-supported program, mainly reflecting better revenue performance
(Text tables 1–2, and Table 4). The overall deficit is expected to be reduced to about
4½ percent in 2012 and further to around 3 percent over the medium term. This deficit level
should be financeable from available concessional resources, debt relief, and new regional
and external borrowing. To anchor fiscal policy, the authorities are targeting a small basic
primary surplus9 after the crisis-related deficit spike in 2011 so as to generate resources to at
least service interest payments.

8

Only the missed coupons of the Eurobond 2032 (December 2010, June and December 2011) are expected to be
rescheduled.

9

The basic primary balance is defined as total revenue (excluding grants) less expenditure net of scheduled
interest and foreign-financed capital expenditure.

22.
The authorities are designing a 2012 budget with revenue
weakened in part by the lagged effect of the crisis on the tax base
and with investment spending given top priority.

MEFP ¶19, 20, 23



Revenue in 2012 is projected to fall almost 1½ percentage points of GDP below its
2010 level10 reflecting largely lower oil production and a large reduction in producer
prices for natural gas and thus related government income (0.4 percent of GDP), and
the impact of the recent domestic crisis on profits (0.4 percent), and lower fuel taxes
due to the freeze in fuel prices since April 2010 (0.6 percent). At the same time, the
authorities intend to strengthen revenue administration, streamline tax exemptions,
tackle tax fraud and evasion, and restructure state-owned corporations to improve
their net contribution to the budget. They are also planning to introduce new taxes on
rubber and some telecommunications.



Expenditure is projected to rise by ½ percent of GDP in 2012 compared to 2010 with
expenditures shifted sharply toward investment. Current spending is to be over
1 percentage point lower, reflecting savings in crisis-exit spending (largely
election-related, but also due to the discontinuation of the frontline benefit for the
military in July 2011) and other current outlays. In contrast, the wage bill is projected
to increase with the absorption of about 11,000 ex-rebels in the new army and
security forces, and the continued recruitment of previously unpaid volunteer teachers
in the North of the country. The civil service census was delayed due to the crisis and
estimates of potential savings are not yet available. Investment spending is budgeted
to rise by almost 2 percentage points of GDP to a still relatively modest 5 percent of
GDP in 2012.



As a result, the overall budget deficit including grants would be larger in 2012 than in
the pre-2011 years (4.4 percent of GDP in 2012 compared to 2.3 percent in 2010).
Similarly, the primary basic deficit, while improved from 2011, at 2 percent of GDP
would far exceed the deficit of 0.2 percent registered in 2010.

23.
The financing program for the 2012 budget envisages that the
MEFP ¶22, 43–44
gap will be covered by concessional multilateral funding, debt relief,
and domestic/regional borrowing. Nevertheless, the high level of net domestic/regional
borrowing (CFAF450 billion or 3.6 percent of GDP)11 exceeds historical levels of access to
this market and is a risk factor in the program. While resisting explicit contingency measures
in the budget to deal with the funding risk, the authorities assured staff that they would
continue to pursue a conservative budget management policy and not commit expenditures
unless the corresponding resources had been secured.
10

Comparisons here are made to 2010, the last “normal” year, as the 2011 figures cover only
end-April–December and the ratios to period GDP are biased somewhat by developments during the crisis,
which shifted some annual revenues and expenditures into the 2011 budget.

11

The 3.6 percent of GDP of net domestic/regional borrowing is made up of 1.7 percent of GDP of borrowing
from other WAEMU countries and another 1.9 percent of GDP from Ivoirien banks, included as part of other
domestic bank financing (net). The latter also includes -0.7 percent of GDP of amortization of non-securitized
debt.

19
B. Structural Reforms in 2011–12
24.
The authorities are planning to speed up and broaden
MEFP ¶25–42
structural reforms as these are vital to improve the business climate
and productivity. Key reform areas include public financial management, public enterprise
reform, the coffee-cocoa sector, the energy sector, the financial sector, judicial reform, and
the business environment. They are also moving forward with pension reform, preparing a
new investment code, hydrocarbon law, and competition law. Good progress has been
achieved on EITI as the reports for 2008–09 and a validation report are expected to be
submitted by the end of the year as the basis for the country’s validation as conforming to the
EITI criteria.
25.
The government intends to keep the wage bill under control
MEFP ¶37–38
and improve the management of the civil service. The strategy adopted
in May 2010 for controlling the payroll will be updated in Q1 2012 based on the results of
the census and a new Single Reference File (SRF) for civil servants. The SRF will be used to
set up an integrated personnel management system (SIGFAE), which should be finalized in
the course of 2012. The government plans to institute an Observatory of Public Services,
create the positions of General Secretaries in all ministries, and adopt a code of ethics for the
civil service.
26.
The authorities continue to implement their action plan to
MEFP ¶40, 42
strengthen public financial management and debt management. Key
reforms include further streamlining the use of treasury advances, improving the process for
the reimbursement of VAT credits through a new joint State/private sector committee; and
strengthening the debt management process. To this end, the government has requested
technical assistance from the IMF and World Bank to prepare an action plan for a
medium-term strategy. Also, the authorities are extending the implementation of
medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF) to six new ministries. They expect to
undertake, in collaboration with the World Bank and the Fund, an assessment regarding the
implementation of the PEMFAR so far; they will then update their PEMFAR matrix
accordingly.
27.
Efforts to improve the management of state enterprises and to
MEFP ¶33
streamline the government’s portfolio are underway. The authorities want
to reduce the number of public enterprises by 25 percent, and introduce performance
contracts for state corporations and majority-owned public corporations. They are
determined to accelerate the clearance of arrears owed by public enterprises to the pension
funds (CGRAE and CNPS).
28.
The government is determined to improve governance,
MEFP ¶30
productivity and farm income in the coffee/cocoa sector. A reduction in
effective taxation to a maximum of 22 percent ad valorem was achieved in 2010/11, and the
focus is now on a new legal framework and institutional set-up as well as a new mechanism
for marketing and extension services. Discussions with key players are ongoing, albeit
difficult, and the authorities hope to adopt a new strategy during the crop year starting in
October 2011.

20
29.
The authorities are committed to reforming the energy sector
MEFP ¶31, 34-5
and reinstating market-based fuel pricing. A renegotiation of natural gas
contracts expected to reduce the cost of natural gas used for thermal power
generation by 1/3, thus lowering the electricity subsidy, is to be completed in November. To
render the electricity sector financially viable over the medium term, an electricity tariff
reform and increase in industrial tariffs will occur in early 2012, and investments to reduce
technical losses are being undertaken. While fuel prices have remained frozen since April
2010 by reducing the tax wedge, a return to market-based fuel pricing and more realistic tax
levels is expected as of mid-2012. The price review strategy will have to consider the impact
on the poor, if any, and the subsequent costs of social safety nets.
30.
The authorities are preparing a financial sector development
strategy to reduce vulnerabilities and broaden access to financial
services.

MEFP ¶29, 39



This strategy is to define the government’s role in the financial sector, and address
the issues of the cost of credit, the rehabilitation of microfinance institutions, the
mechanisms for financing housing, SMEs and agriculture. The government has
requested technical assistance from the World Bank and the IMF, and funding from
the Financial Sector Reform and Strengthening (FIRST) Initiative for this purpose.



The government intends to work with the Banking Commission to limit losses
incurred by the 5 state-owned banks and improve their operations without injecting
new resources. A restructuring strategy will be elaborated and fiscal implications, if
any, clarified.



To improve the financial viability of the pension funds, the authorities plan to adopt
the reform plans for CNPS and CGRAE in 2011; these will also require parliamentary
approval. The retirement age for certain categories of government officials and agents
will be raised from 57 to 62 years as of 2012, and collection efforts of overdue social
contributions will be enhanced.

31.
The authorities are stepping up efforts to improve the business
MEFP ¶26-28
climate. Measures in this area include setting up a Business Facilitation Center
to simplify the administrative procedures required to start a business, and a one-stop window
for trade formalities, reform of the property registry to facilitate the delivery of title and the
use of land as a security, adoption of a competition law and new investment code,
enforcement of arbitration awards (exequatur), setting up commercial courts and broader
judicial reform.

21
V. PROGRAM DESIGN, FINANCING, AND RISKS
A. External Arrears and Program Financing
32.
Côte d’Ivoire has arrears to official bilateral and commercial
MEFP ¶43-45
creditors, which it intends to regularize. The authorities have initiated
discussions with Paris Club creditors on a restructuring of arrears and maturities due during
mid-2011 to mid-2014 and with the holders of the Eurobond 2032 on the restructuring of
2 missed coupon payments (December 2010 and June 2011) and the next coupon falling due
at end-2011. The authorities continue to make good faith efforts to negotiate the treatment of
arrears with private external creditors. The Paris Club provided financing assurances on
October 19, 2011.
33.
The financing gaps during 2011–14 (totalling 16 percent of 2012 GDP) are
expected to be filled by debt restructuring, multilateral support, and new
domestic/regional borrowing (Table 7). While the bulk of debt relief is expected in early
2012 with the restructuring of accumulated arrears, the remaining gap during 2011–12 after
World Bank and AfDB support is projected to be met by disbursements under the ECF. The
authorities have also requested the third tranche of HIPC Interim assistance in the amount of
SDR 5.024 million, which will be sufficient to cover 86.1 percent of eligible ECF principal
repayment obligations falling due during November 2011–October 2012. Furthermore, if the
necessary requirements are met, Côte d’Ivoire could reach the HIPC Completion Point and
benefit from the MDRI in the second half of 2012.
B. Program modalities
34.
ECF access is proposed at 120 percent of quota (SDR 390.24 million). This
request is based on the staff’s assessment of the overall financing needs and is consistent
with the ECF access norm for a country with outstanding credit below 100 percent of quota
(Côte d’Ivoire’s current outstanding credit is 99.6% of quota). A slightly front-loaded
disbursement schedule is proposed as the critical challenges facing Côte d’Ivoire are
immediate and external financing needs are projected to ease over time (Table 8). Strong
Fund support would help catalyze support from donors. The authorities are planning to
organize a donor roundtable in early 2012 once the PRSP has been updated, and a
Consultative Group meeting after reaching the HIPC Completion Point to secure donor
support over the medium term. Côte d’Ivoire has a long track record of meeting its
obligations to the Fund and an adequate capacity to repay (Table 9), provided the country
takes the necessary action to secure HIPC debt relief. Program performance would be
monitored on the basis of quantitative indicators (Table 10) and structural benchmarks
(Table 11).
35.
The risks to the program are dominated by internal factors in this post-conflict
situation. While substantial progress has been made in improving security, the situation
remains fragile. The speed of economic recovery will depend on how quickly confidence
returns and banks resume lending to the private sector as well as investing in government
securities. The government is operating under tight financial constraints and envisages a
large access to the regional financial market in 2012, yet is facing the evolving cost of

22
building a mixed army and security forces, and potential resource needs of a restructuring of
state banks, while addressing urgent infrastructure needs. The completion of the election
cycle in 2011–12 will test how far the country has stabilized. Côte d’Ivoire also remains
vulnerable to external shocks such as oil, or to a lesser extent, food price increases, a
weakening of the terms of trade, and a prolonged global slowdown.
VI. STAFF APPRAISAL
36.
Côte d’Ivoire is emerging quickly from the post-election political crisis, but
major challenges remain in the transition from crisis recovery to sustained growth.
These challenges include the need to further improve security to allow the free circulation of
persons and goods, to advance national reconciliation and integration of the ex-combatants
into the new security forces or civilian life, and to re-establish macroeconomic stability while
fostering investment to relaunch economic growth.
37.
The authorities’ fiscal response to the economic crisis in 2011 has been
appropriate and the implementation of the RCF-supported program to date has been
good. At the same time, while the sizeable budget deficit in April–December 2011 is being
financed largely from external sources and debt service arrears that require a restructuring,
fiscal policy in 2012 and beyond needs to restore the revenue base and limit current spending
in order to create fiscal space for the planned, and much needed, and increase in public
investment, especially in energy and infrastructure. Staff consider the planned fiscal stance in
2012 to be appropriate, though further consolidation will be needed over the medium term.
38.
Staff support the planned revenue measures and the ending of most of the
temporary tax relief measures granted in 2011. But commodity revenues will decline with
the fall in oil production and the renegotiation of natural gas prices. Profit taxes in 2012 will
reflect the hit the economy took in the first half of 2011. Thus continued efforts to enhance
tax administration will be needed to achieve the revenue targets.
39.
The authorities’ conservative budget management is welcome and has kept
expenditures in line with available resources. The delayed adoption of the budget in
June 2011 has led to a slow execution of expenditure, in particular for investment, and major
efforts will be needed to fully implement the budgeted allocations. Continued vigilance will
be required to control the wage bill; the census results should allow some savings that will
need to balance out at least some of the costs of the ongoing new hiring into the integrated
security forces and the education sector. The planned containment of electricity subsidies and
tighter management of other current spending would allow room for the sizeable increase in
investment spending. In this context, the preparation of an ambitious but realistic public
investment program will be crucial for reaching the authorities’ expenditure goals and the
successful implementation of projects.
40.
Restarting the structural reforms will be essential to increase the economy’s
efficiency, strengthen external competitiveness, and regain the confidence of private
investors. The authorities’ plans are ambitious and appropriate, particularly the focus on
restoring the financial viability of the electricity sector, rebuilding the transport
infrastructure, restructuring the important coffee/cocoa sector, and the various efforts to

23
improve the business climate. A financial sector development strategy should further
financial deepening while controlling the losses of the public banks. A debt management
strategy should help improve debt management and should guide future borrowing
operations to identify the most appropriate vehicles to fund the economy’s extensive
investment needs while maintaining debt sustainability after HIPC debt relief.
41.
Staff supports the authorities’ request for assistance under the ECF in the
amount of 120 percent of quota and for further interim HIPC assistance in light of the
balance of payments and fiscal needs and the catalytic effect of Fund support on other
external assistance. There are significant risks to the outlook in this post-conflict situation,
including a lack of decisive improvements in the security situation and political
normalization, lackluster progress on structural reforms, limited access to regional financial
markets, external shocks, but there could also be a stronger-than-projected rebound in
activity. These risks should be manageable in light of the authorities’ strong commitment to
the policies to be supported by the ECF. If the challenges in the short term are addressed
effectively, prospects are good for Côte d’Ivoire to embark on the ambitious growth
trajectory envisaged by the authorities and make progress towards alleviating poverty and
achieving the MDGs.
42.
It is proposed that during the ECF arrangement Côte d’Ivoire stay on a 24-month
Article IV cycle in accordance with the decision on consultation cycles.12

APPENDIX I. CÔTE D’IVOIRE: LETTER OF INTENT
Abidjan, October 20, 2011
Madame Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington DC, 20431
Madame Managing Director,
1.
Significant progress has been made in normalizing the security and economic
situation in Côte d'Ivoire since the end of the post-election crisis. The government has
begun the process of national reconciliation with a view to consolidate the peace. To this
end, it created and established the Dialogue, Truth and Reconciliation Commission (CDVR).
The security situation is improving progressively and the first legislative elections since the
end of National Assembly’s term in 2005 are planned for December 11, 2011. The recovery
of the economy, which is a priority of the government, should help to consolidate the peace.
In this context, the economic and financial policies of the government, have benefited from
the support if the international financial community, in particular through the Rapid Credit
Facility of the IMF and exceptional financial assistance from the French Development
Agency, the African Development Bank, and the World Bank. The result was a rapid
recovery despite the deterioration of our infrastructure after more than a decade marked
by a weak level of investment. In June 2011, the industrial production index was already at
95 percent of its June 2010 level. However, private investment is still suffering from a
“wait-and-see” attitude among economic agents.
2.
To restore confidence and ensure strong and sustained growth, the government
resumed several months ago the implementation of certain structural reforms and
launched many projects financed by public resources. To this end, we have set out a
medium-term economic and financial program, which emphasizes policies to relaunch
economic growth and poverty reduction, by promoting a more dynamic private sector that
will create jobs. In regard to public finance, we expect to create fiscal space to increase
public investment. To accomplish this, we expect to increase tax revenue, restore financial
balance to the electricity sector, and to the private and the public pension funds. The
government also intends to restructure its portfolio of enterprises with the aim of
streamlining it. It will move ahead with the reform of the financial sector, in particular giving
priority to the public banks, for which urgent actions have been formulated to avoid a
deterioration in their financial situation. The government will not inject new resources in
these banks outside of a restructuring plan discussed with the IMF. These actions will be
supplemented by reform of public finances. We have started implementing measures to
improve the business climate. The program as a whole will be strengthened by improved
effectiveness of the public administration.

40
3.
The attached Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP)
describes the policies that we plan to implement during the program period. We are
requesting the IMF to support our three-year economic and financial program through the
Extended Credit Facility. In this context, we request financial support in an amount
equivalent to 120 percent of our quota share, or SDR 390.24 million. At the same time, the
government requests the resumption of interim assistance provided by the IMF in the context
of the HIPC Initiative, specifically, the third tranche of this assistance in the amount of SDR
5.042 million.
4.
The government is determined to reach the HIPC Completion Point as soon as
possible. Debt relief on external debt at the Completion Point will be a major step in the
economic and financial management of our country, and will confirm our commitment to
advance Côte d’Ivoire. It will contribute (i) to the sustainability of public finances and the
normalization of relations with our its creditors, (ii) to attracting investment; and (iii) to
reducing poverty in our country, thanks to a sound reorientation of budgetary spending. To
achieve this in 2012, the government will take all the steps needed to implement the
remaining Completion Point conditions.
5.
The government is convinced that the policies and measures presented in this
memorandum are sufficient to turn the situation around. It will consult with IMF staff at
its own initiative or at the request of the IMF Managing Director prior to the adoption of any
additional measures that it may deem necessary or in the event of changes to the policies set
forth in this Memorandum. The government also undertakes to cooperate fully with the IMF
to achieve the program objectives.
6. The Ivoirien authorities agree to the publication of this Letter of Intent and the
attached Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) and Technical
Memorandum of Understanding (TMU), as well as the IMF staff report relating to the
request for an arrangement under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF). We hereby
authorize their publication and posting on the IMF website following approval of the
ECF-supported program by the IMF Executive Board.
Very truly yours,

ATTACHMENT I—CÔTE D’IVOIRE: MEMORANDUM OF ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL POLICIES
October 20, 2011
I. INTRODUCTION
1.
The crisis following the proclamation of the outcome of the second round of the
presidential election of November 28, 2010 affected the country greatly. Lasting some six
months, the crisis had serious repercussions on the political, economic, social and humanitarian
situation. At the humanitarian level, it sparked a mass exodus of people to the interior of the
country and also into neighboring countries. It also led to a generalized loss of security, a threemonth shutdown of most banks, the imposition of economic sanctions, combat with heavy
weapons, and supply problems for medications and foodstuffs. Regarding the economy, the
government's operational capacity was reduced through pillaging and theft. The private sector
saw some of its productive capacity destroyed. The situation led to the closure of many
businesses, particularly small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and many workers were
laid off temporarily. The industrial production index was down by half in April 2011 from its
level in April 2010. Disruptions in distribution channels were reflected in shortages of foodstuffs
leading to generalized hikes in consumer prices. The “food” component of the consumer price
index recorded a year-on-year increase of some 16 percent in April 2011.
2.
Since the end of the post-election crisis, Côte d'Ivoire has made remarkable progress
towards normalization, but important challenges remain. Normalization of the political
situation accelerated after the inauguration of the President of the Republic on May 21, 2011 and
the formation of a government on June 1. There has been a steady improvement in the security
situation since May 2011. With the cessation of hostilities, the government has moved to unify
the army, to reorganize and redeploy the gendarmerie and the police. On the social front, the
government has established the Dialogue, Truth and Reconciliation Commission (CDVR) thereby
opening the way to national reconciliation with a view to achieving a lasting settlement of the
sociopolitical crisis that has gripped the country since 1999. To address social needs resulting
from the disastrous humanitarian situation, the government has taken steps to guarantee free
access to health care and to public hospitals and health centers since May 2011. Economic
activity has gradually recovered since the reopening of banks and financial institutions at the end
of April 2011 and the lifting of the European Union embargo. Thanks to the energetic measures
taken by the government, nearly all economic indicators have turned favorable since May 2011.
However, the fallout from the crisis persists, in the form of extortion rackets, roadblocks, and the
continued weakness of private investment.
3.
The government's policy is to move on from the relaunch of activities to
consolidation and a sustainable recovery of economic growth. This challenge will require
significant efforts in terms of investment. During the last 10 years, the average investment rate
remained below 10 percent of GDP, compared to 16 percent in the late 1990s and 25 percent
during the 1970s. The public component of investment was particularly affected during the long

42
period of crisis, to the point where the infrastructure needed to sustain growth and to maintain the
country's position as the engine of the subregional economy could not be guaranteed. The reforms
undertaken during our ECF program concluded in March 2009, which remain in execution, will
be pursued so as to allow key sectors of the economy to contribute to their full potential. The
2011 budget, adopted on June 22, recognizes this concern to support the recovery of activities,
and to make a start at restoring infrastructure, while addressing the most pressing needs of the
population. It is consistent with the framework of the interim economic and financial program
supported by the Rapid Credit Facility (RCF).
4.
The government is determined to restore the country to sustained growth, to
promote good governance and to combat poverty effectively. To this end, it has set the
following short and medium-term objectives:







To consolidate national reconciliation;
To reinforce security and free movement for persons and goods throughout the national
territory;
To improve the business climate in order to bolster the confidence of households,
economic operators and investors;
To increase the level and quality of investment, particularly the public component;
To promote good governance;
To promote economic growth and job creation.

The government firmly intends to respect the commitments made in 2011 under the Rapid Credit
Facility (RCF) and to pursue implementation of the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). It
will give priority to economic policies that will foster growth and boost employment while
reducing poverty. To this end, a government seminar was held on July 5 and 6, 2011 in
Yamoussoukro, during which each of the 36 ministries established specific objectives for the
second half of 2011, with benchmarks that allow for regular monitoring of progress achieved.
5.
The government is determined to achieve the Completion Point under the HIPC
Initiative as quickly as possible. To do so, it will take all the steps necessary to meet the
remaining triggers for the HIPC Completion Point in 2011, including a start at implementing the
coffee-cocoa reform and continued execution of the PRSP (Box 1).
This memorandum describes progress to date under the program supported by the RCF and sets
out our medium-term economic program with our objectives for 201–12.
II. RECENT ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RCF-SUPPORTED
PROGRAM IN 2011
A. Recent Economic Developments
6.
Since April 26, 2011, when the banks and financial institutions reopened, the
government has pursued its economic and financial policy objectives despite a particularly

43
difficult post-crisis context. It has worked for the rapid restoration of relations with its main
international partners. It has also ensured that administrative actions were in strict accordance
with the principles of sound management. At the same time, the restoration of dialogue with
private sector operators has helped to speed the recovery.


In light of the trend in the main macroeconomic indicators to the end of June 2011, the
growth objectives was revised from -6.3 percent to -5.8 percent. That relative
improvement can be laid to the primary sector, where growth is expected to be 1.7 percent
as compared to the initially forecast -0.3 percent, thanks to agricultural exports—cocoa in
particular—and mining activity. The secondary and tertiary sectors have recovered in line
with earlier forecasts. The industrial production index in June 2011 was already at
95 percent of its June 2010 level, and in July reached 98 percent of its level a year earlier.



Year-on-year inflation stood at 4.6 percent at the end of June, largely as a result of higher
food prices (+9.3 percent) due in part to international prices and to racketeering. However,
this level is lower than the situation in April, due to the renewed supply to the markets.
Annual inflation stood at 4.5 percent in July. A continuation of this performance should
help to dampen the resurgence of inflationary pressures, bringing the inflation rate for the
year down to the Community threshold of 3 percent.



Regarding the external accounts, at the end of June 2011, the trade surplus (excluding
exceptional goods) was up nearly 52 percent over June 2010. This sharp growth resulted
from a recovery in exports, particularly of cocoa (23.6 percent) following the lifting of the
embargo, as well as from a decline in imports associated with the reduced economic
activity.



Ivoirien banks have reopened for business at the end of the post-election crisis. The crisis
has aggravated their financial situation, particularly for the State-owned banks. At the end
of June 2011, financial data for the banking system show a decline of 8 percent from
December 2010 in sound loans, an increase of 44 percent in nonperforming loans, and
abundant liquidity. The government will continue renewing government securities until
October, as has been done since December 2010 as a result of the post-election crisis.
B. Budgetary Policy and Execution of the Economic and Financial Program in 2011

7.
Budget execution to the end of June 2011 has been generally consistent with the
budget. The performance at end-June 2011 against the benchmarks in the RCF-supported
program is in line with the objectives. In fact, total revenues amounted to 483.0 billion compared
to a projected 407.8 billion. The wage bill was held to CFAF 272.7 billion versus
CFAF 282.1 billion programmed. The basic fiscal balance stood at CFAF -56.1 billion compared
to a target of CFAF -134.1 billion, thanks to better revenue collection and under-execution of
expenditures (Table 1).

44
8.
Tax revenues exceeded forecasts thanks to: (i) a rapid reopening of the tax collection
agencies (régies financières), (ii) efforts to collect the main taxes, in particular the VAT, the ITS,
non-oil profit taxes and cocoa levies; and (iii) payments made since the end of April against tax
returns for the first quarter. In fact, the government rehabilitated and re-equipped the tax
collection services with basic work tools so that they could begin revenue collection as of April,
despite the systematic looting they had suffered. Also, gradual improvements in security and
efforts to pay down domestic arrears, combined with the return of a climate of confidence, have
favored a greater-than-expected mobilization of domestic revenue.
9.
Expenditures fell short of targets because of the late adoption of the budget. Current
expenditures (dépenses ordinaries) were limited in May and June, but should be in line with
planned amounts by the end of 2011. Thus, the program target for the payroll, projected at
CFAF 727.4 billion, remains unchanged and reflects spending on the creation of the new army
and on the recruitment of teachers and health personnel. Investment spending should also
accelerate in the second half of the year, in the context of: (i) specific provisions taken with
respect to public procurement; (ii) the execution of the Presidential Emergency Program; (iii) the
start of work on the third bridge in Abidjan; (iv) the continuation of major public works; and
(v) the execution of pro-poor spending under the PRSP.
10.
The government has continued and has reviewed the reforms initiated under the
Economic and Financial Program supported by the previous ECF arrangement. To this end,
it has initiated an update of the PRSP in order to take account of new priorities stemming from the
post-election crisis and to put in place a coherent framework for intervention that will address
humanitarian, emergency, reconstruction, and development issues in 2011. It also organized a
seminar on the outlook for the energy sector in June 2011, to prepare a diagnosis of the sector and
to define new strategic directions. The financial sector, which suffered heavily from the
Post-election crisis, was the object of an advisory mission sent at the government’s request from
the Monetary and Capital Markets Department of the IMF. This mission addressed the
development strategy for the financial sector as well as management of the domestic debt.
The other actions taken regarding sectoral reforms are:


The continuing efforts to finalize the coffee and cocoa sector reform;



The reduction of the deficit in the electricity sector, through the relaunch of negotiations
on the price of gas and the export price for energy.



The launch of the study on the structure of petroleum product prices, with a view to
adopting a new tax structure.



For customs, making operational the database on prices and putting into service the
computerized module for managing exemptions in accordance with the recommendations
from the Grand Bassam seminar of June 2010, and the continuation of other reforms with
technical assistance from the IMF Fiscal Affairs Department.

45


The reform of the CNPS [private sector pension fund], which should be adopted before the
end of December 2011.



The reform of the CGRAE [public sector pension fund], which should be finalized and
adopted by the government before the end of December 2011.



The continuation of the reform of the public administration, including creation of the
position of General Secretary in the ministries.



Improvements to debt management, through the establishment of a National Committee
on the Public Debt, for which the draft decree has been prepared and submitted to
members of the government for adoption before the end of November 2011.



The resumption of reports to the Council of Ministers on physical and financial flows in
the energy and coffee-cocoa sectors, with the production of reports on the situation at
end-June 2011.



The continued production of the quarterly report on gross petroleum shipments.

11.
The government has also continued implementing the structural reforms in 2011
covered under the program supported by the Rapid Credit Facility. The actions taken
concern:


The resumption of the census of government officials and agents, which was has been in
progress since August 29, 2011.



The continued implementation of the PSRP through the execution of pro-poor spending
and the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) for the social sectors (health and
education/training).



The finalization of the software for monitoring exemptions in the Inland Revenue
Directorate (DGI).



The implementation of the module for managing advances and the module for managing
amendments in the Budget and Finance Directorate (DGBF).

In addition, in the context of strengthening governance and moral standards in public life, the
government has adopted a code of ethics and conduct for members of the government. It has also
adopted an annual matrix of actions that is subject to a monthly evaluation and quarterly review
by a special Council of Ministers meeting.
III. ECONOMIC PROGRAM 2011–14
A. Macroeconomic Framework
12.
The government intends to adopt and implement an economic and financial program
for the period 2011–14 that is based on establishing a sustainable and durable growth
dynamic supported by an increase in investment. After more than a decade of weak economic

46
growth, the government’s program seeks to increase public and private investment in order to
equip the country with high-quality economic infrastructure and support growth-generating sectors.
This program to revive investment is part of the framework to achieve the Millennium
Development Goals (MDG) in a country that is unified and at peace. In this regard, it takes into
account the challenge of reducing poverty, through the implementation of the PRSP and a
sustained recovery of private sector activity supported by an improvement in the business climate
and the promotion of good governance. Fiscal policy will also be focused on a better management
of the public finances, taking into account the broadening of the tax base.
13.
The principal macroeconomic objectives for the period 2012–14 are to accelerate
economic growth and control inflation. Growth will be supported by the resumption of
large-scale development projects, in particular investments. The government intends to contain
the increase in the wage bill and in operating expenditures in favor of investment spending. It also
intends to take advantage of external debt relief beyond the HIPC Initiative, in particular through
the “Debt Reduction and Development Contracts (C2D)” announced by France. The policy of
boosting investment significantly relies heavily on public-private partnerships (PPP) with
establishment of a National PPP Committee in August 2011. Private investments should also
increase in line with the improvement in the business climate. Moreover, sectoral development
policies, particularly for staple food crops, should improve the market supply situation and help
contain consumer prices.
14.
The Ivoirien economy should recover with positive growth of 8.5 percent in 2012, as
the economic fabric is restored. This would reflect the catch-up effect after the major shock
suffered in 2011 as a result of the crisis. It would result from a significant rebound in the
secondary sector (12.6 percent) and in the tertiary sector (13.7 percent), which recorded negative
rates of -9.7 percent and -12.7 percent, respectively, in 2011. The public investment rate should
register a major increase, rising from 2.7 percent in 2011 to 5 percent in 2012. The overall
increase in consumer prices should be contained so that the inflation rate would be 2.2 percent.
15.
The recovery of growth in 2012 should continue in 2013 and 2014, at an average rate
of 6 percent. The government intends to continue to promote investment in order to reach a level
of 12.6 percent of GDP in 2013 and 14.3 percent in 2014. Specifically, public investment should
rise from 5 percent of GDP in 2012 to 6.9 percent in 2014. During that time efforts will be aimed
at attracting private investment. As of 2013, policies to contain prices by promoting staple food
crops and improving road conditions should make it possible to keep inflation below 3 percent.
16.
To achieve its macroeconomic objectives, the government plans to accelerate
structural reforms and to create a framework that will encourage private sector activities
and employment. It intends to pursue the restructuring of the coffee and cocoa sector and the
energy sector, to update the plan for reforming the public finances (PEMFAR II), the reform of
the public administration, an acceleration in the implementation of the PRSP, the adoption of a
three-year Public Investment Program (PIP), and the strengthening of the financial system. It also
plans to: (i) restore security throughout the national territory; (ii) rehabilitate and upgrade the

47
country's socioeconomic infrastructure; (iii) improve the business climate and governance;
(iv) reinforce the rule of law; (v) guarantee free movement for persons and goods; and
(vi) strengthen the role of Côte d'Ivoire in the regional integration process.
B. Fiscal Policy
17.
Fiscal policy in 2011–14 seeks to increase public investment while keeping the public
debt sustainable. To do this, the government intends to: (i) increase revenues by expanding the
tax base and making tax administration more efficient; and (ii) control current expenditures, in
particular the wage bill. The government is targeting an overall fiscal deficit (as defined in the
attached technical memorandum of understanding) of 4.4 percent of GDP in 2012, and a further
reduction in 2013–14.
18.
The 2011 budget is designed to support the recovery and normalization of economic
activities and to limit the effects of the crisis by responding to the urgent needs of the
population. In particular, it has made it possible to address the humanitarian and social impact of
the crisis, to improve security and to cover non-discretionary expenditures (public debt service,
personnel costs) despite the decline in government revenues below the levels of previous years
associated with the post-election crisis. The government has taken important steps to support the
private sector in its recovery efforts. In this context, it granted tax relief to the private sector at an
estimated cost of CFAF 32.4 billion in addition to direct general fiscal support in the amount of
CFAF 12 billion and targeted sectoral measures. The government has also decided to significantly
reduce balances outstanding to its suppliers. Cash payments planned in this respect amount to
some CFAF 145 billion. It will also avoid the accumulation of new domestic arrears. Through
these measures, the government intends to permit the private sector to restore its cash position
and to play a major role in reviving the national economy. Based on performance through the end
of June, the revenue agencies have made significant collection efforts while expenditure
execution has remained fairly weak, reflecting the late adoption of the budget. The budgeted
fiscal balances at end-December 2011 should be met.
19.
The 2012 budgetary exercise will focus on raising tax revenues in the context of
declining budgetary aid. It will give emphasis to promoting public investment, with an
allocation of around 22.7 percent of budgetary revenues to investment versus 11.9 percent in 2010
and 15.9 percent in 2011. The overall fiscal deficit including grants should move from 8.1 percent
of GDP in 2011 to 4.4 percent of GDP in 2012. To achieve these results, the following actions
and initiatives are planned:


New taxes will be introduced, in particular on some telecommunications and on rubber.



Management of the “single taxpayer file” will be reorganized with the creation of an
assessment and collection unit exclusively for the property tax, with a view to increasing
its yield significantly.

48


Work on the property registry (cadastre) will be stepped up in order to take better account
of tax opportunities offered by rapid urban growth. In particular, this will make it easier to
locate taxpayers and assess them more realistically.



The tax administration will pursue its policy of decentralizing its services and broadening
the tax base; the customs authorities will build on the reforms stemming from technical
assistance recommendations, including those of the IMF, and will take steps to harmonize
exemptions.



The customs and internal revenue administrations will also work to ensure effective tax
collection throughout the national territory, including in the former CNW zones.



The government will step up the systematic collection of revenues from administrative
fees.



The government will implement a policy to streamline the government’s portfolio of
enterprises to improve their financial contribution to the budget.



The fight against tax fraud and evasion will be reinforced, together with campaigns to
promote a taxpaying culture.

20.
The government plans to give as much priority as possible to public investment to
spur the reduction of poverty and support growth. To create fiscal space for public
investment, the government will limit operating expenditures to CFAF 474.2 billion, electricity
subsidies to CFAF 76.0 billion and crisis-exit spending to CFAF 30.0 billion. Furthermore,
current spending will be limited through stricter controls on consumption of utilities. The wage
bill will be contained, with due regard to staffing needs in the social and security sectors. Also the
government intends to step up efforts to rehabilitate basic infrastructure, to pursue development
programs, and to promote staple crops and export agriculture. In addition, the government plans
to promote the revival of the secondary sector, in particular agro-industry and its potential for
employment creation.
21.
Implementation of the PRSP will be accelerated in 2012. The government will update
the PRSP before the end of 2011, and during the first half of 2012 it will produce a progress
report on implementation of the PRSP in 2010–11. Spending in 2012 will take account of the
need to continue implementation of the PRSP. The government intends to give priority in
budgetary spending to pro-poor expenditure, which amounts to CFAF 980.0 billion (7.9 percent
of GDP) compared to CFAF 885.2 billion (7.8 percent of GDP) in 2010. Moreover, it will
improve the supply of basic socioeconomic infrastructure, bearing in mind the needs identified in
the updating of the PRSP. A Round Table to establish dialogue between the government and its
partners on development priorities and on support for implementing the PRSP will be organized
for during late 2011 and early 2012. There are also plans to organize a Consultative Group for the
overall financing of the PRSP, once the Completion Point is reached.

49
22.
The government will be prudent in its spending. It will make contingency provisions to
execute expenditures within the limits of available domestic resources. In this regard, meetings of
the Treasury Committee will continue so that the necessary adjustments can be made in the
management of the budget through the Integrated Public Finance Management System (SIGFIP).
23.
Investment spending will rise to meet the needs of reconstruction and fighting
poverty. The 2012 budget calls for an increase in domestically financed investment expenditures
of 110 percent from 2011. These funds will be used primarily for rehabilitating basic
infrastructure, implementing the Presidential Emergency Program, development projects, and
promoting agriculture, as well as for projects to support the commercialization of food products
and the integration of young people into the trade sector.
24.
The government plans to extend the maturity of public securities. To this end, it has
prepared a plan to end the rollover of securities linked to the crisis. The plan foresees the payment
in October 2011 of the capitalized interest of CFAF 20 billion, and the outstanding treasury bills,
valued at CFAF 609.5 billion at end August 2011, will be replaced by a two-year treasury bond
and two OAT bonds (Obligations Assimilables du Trésor) of three and five years, earning interest
at 4.75 percent, 5 percent and 5.25 percent respectively. The government has undertaken broad
consultation with its creditors and with the BCEAO. It has received agreement in principle from
Ivoirien banks and from the BCEAO. It will request the BCEAO to take the necessary
complementary measures, including acceptance of the securities for refinancing and as required
reserves.
C. Structural Reforms
25.
To accelerate economic growth will require defining and implementing significant
reforms to bring more transparency to the government’s actions and to guarantee a greater
contribution from the main sectors. To this end, the government intends to deepen the actions
under way with respect to the public finances, the coffee-cocoa sector, the energy sector, the
financial sector, the public administration, and the business environment (Boxes 2 to 8 and
Table 3). It is also committed to addressing the challenges to establish security, reduce poverty
and unemployment in order to consolidate peace and social cohesion.
26.
The government will implement its action plan to improve governance. In this regard,
in 2012 it will complete the reforms already begun, including adoption by the Council of
Ministers of the national governance and anticorruption plan, the law on illicit enrichment, the
charter of ethics and the code of conduct for civil servants. In addition, the government will
strengthen the control, inspection and evaluation system within the public administration through
operational audits, and a strengthening of the role of the General Inspectorate of State (Inspection
Générale d'Etat), the General Inspectorate of Finance (Inspection Générale des Finances), and
the sectoral audit offices.

50
27.
The government will take appropriate steps to reinforce the independence,
impartiality and effectiveness of the judicial system, as well as strengthen security
conditions. It has begun to redeploy justice officials throughout the national territory, and to
rehabilitate and reopen jails and detention centers. It also plans to adopt legislation concerning the
decree on the enforcement of (exequatur) of decisions of the Arbitration Courts, the reform of the
judicial system, and the creation of Commercial Courts (Tribunaux de Commerce). Particular
emphasis will be placed on strengthening security and the free movement of goods and persons.
Protection of the economic territory will be made effective through the full deployment of the
Armed Forces and paramilitary forces, including the customs, over the entire national territory.
These steps will improve the effectiveness of efforts to combat fraud, counterfeiting and
smuggling.
28.
Improving the business climate is an important objective of the government. The
policy of growth, with its emphasis on reviving investment, will require a major contribution from
the private sector. To achieve this, it is essential to create an environment attractive for capital
inflows, by simplifying procedures and reducing the costs and charges that burden the running of
a business. Taken together, these actions are intended, among others, to improve the indicators
relating to industrial sector activities listed in the publication “Doing Business”. In particular,
these indicators concern the streamlining of administrative procedures for obtaining industrial
sites and building permits. In this context, the government intends to establish a Business
Facilitation Center before the end of 2012 in order to give economic agents the opportunity to
complete, in one place, all the formalities needed to create a business in Côte d'Ivoire. In addition,
adoption by the government in 2012 of the draft law reforming the property registry should make
it easier to obtain title and security for real estate property and should thereby help develop an
active mortgage market. Also, the draft competition law will be adopted by the government
before the end of March 2012, and the Council of Ministers is expected to approve the investment
code in 2012.
29.
An overall financial sector development strategy will be prepared and adopted. To
ensure adequate financing for the economy, the government intends to help create conditions
whereby the financial sector can play its full role. For this purpose, and taking into account the
impact of the post-election crisis, the government plans:


To launch five studies in the first quarter of 2012, with technical and financial assistance
from the IMF, the World Bank, and the FIRST Initiative, primarily covering financing
mechanisms for housing, SMEs, and food agriculture, as well as the government’s role in
the financial sector, and the cost of credit. The conclusions of these studies will be used to
prepare the strategy, which is expected to be adopted before the end of 2012.



To make the primary issuance market more active by introducing primary dealers for
securities (SVTs), which over time will facilitate the development of a secondary market
among economic operators.

51


To ensure the follow-up of the recommendations of the WAEMU Banking Commission
concerning banks’ observance of prudential norms. The government will continue its
efforts to restructure the banks in difficulty, in particular those that are governmentowned, without injecting new public funds outside a restructuring plan validated by the
authorities and discussed with the IMF and the World Bank. The government-owned
banks are included in the audits initiated by the government as part of the rationalization
of the government’s portfolio. In addition, the government has established governance
organs in these banks, notably the executive boards and Director Generals that have been
instructed to ensure that the banks’ financial position does not deteriorate.



To reinforce the capacity of the Financial Sector Development Committee (CODESFI)
and undertake the priority studies with the aim of preparing a plan for the reform of the
financial sector before the end of August 2012. To this end, it will seek the technical
assistance of World Bank and IMF to define and implement this strategy.



To further the stabilization of the microfinance sector through regular audits and stricter
licensing requirements, with particular attention to the situation of UNACOOPEC-CI.

30.
The government is determined to finalize the reform of the coffee-cocoa sector, in
order to improve farmers’ living conditions and make its management more transparent.
The new strategy, which will set out a new legal and regulatory framework as well as a new
marketing mechanism, should be adopted and introduced during the crop year 2011/12. Producers
will be offered a remunerative price, provided with basic social infrastructure and better
conditions of access to production areas. This new organization should also help to boost
productivity by encouraging programs for replanting the orchards. In addition, the government
will both undertake investment spending in the sector and incorporate the operating costs of the
sector in the government’s budget beginning with the 2013 crop year. The government will
maintain the ad valorem tax at 22 percent of the maximum c.i.f. price for cocoa that was
introduced in September 2010.
31.
The government plans to apply the automatic price fixing mechanism for petroleum
products. It has launched a study of the structure of petroleum product prices in order to adopt a
new structure that takes into account the various parameters and economic agents involved in
setting prices. The conclusions of the study, expected before the end of December 2011, will
serve as input for the government’s petroleum product tax policy. The new strategy will take
account of the need to reflect market prices, to avoid distortions harmful to the SIR (Société
Ivoirienne de Raffinage, Ivoirien Refinery Corporation), to consider the social impact of the
evolution of pump prices, and to support the SIR’s profit margin. The new strategy should be
finalized in the coming months, and the government will put in place an automatic mechanism for
setting petroleum product prices that will reflect market prices as of July 2012.
32.
The government will continue to implement the requirements for meeting the
Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) criteria. It is committed to publishing an

52
EITI report on the 2008 and 2009 data before the end of 2011. The Executive Board of EITI, after
assessing this document and the EITI Validation Report, which has already been submitted, will
be able to decide on the final status of Côte d'Ivoire in implementing the EITI process. The
government will also begin preparation of the EITI report on the 2010 data before the end of
November 2011.
33.
The government will continue efforts to improve the management of public
enterprises. The decision to streamline the portfolio of state enterprises, taken by the Council of
Ministers on June 29, 2011, will be carried out. To do so, the government will first spell out its
strategic vision for the management of public enterprises based on a reframing of their missions
founded on an optimal allocation of public funds and a better socioeconomic and financial return.
The Steering Committee on Evaluation and Restructuring, to be in place before the end of 2011,
will identify overlaps and redundancies among these public enterprises and assess their economic
and financial performance, so that their reframing can be finalized. The committee will then
propose to the government a plan for reducing the scope of the portfolio of public enterprises by
25 percent, before the end of September 2012. In addition, the government intends to finalize
preparation of performance contracts between the state, state corporations and majority-owned
public corporations. It will also make sure of the application of the plan for clearing the arrears,
validated jointly by the two sides, owed by public enterprises to the social security institutions
(CGRAE and CNPS).
34.
The government plans to increase electricity supply to support its policy for
relaunching growth and restoring financial equilibrium in the power sector over the
medium term. The recovery of growth and the promotion of private sector development will
create a greater demand for energy. Given current production capacity, it is essential to expand
the supply of electricity while reducing subsidies to the sector. In order to achieve financial
equilibrium by 2014, the government intends to adopt and implement a strategy for the electricity
sector, comprising: (i) the adoption of the draft electricity code, which reflects the new regulatory
and legal framework; (ii) the conclusion of negotiations to reduce gas prices; (iii) a revision to the
remuneration of the concessionaire; (iv) an improvement in the recovery rate of billing invoices,
particularly in the former CNO zones; (v) the strengthening of measures to combat fraud;
(vi) investments to improve the quality of the transportation and distribution network; (vii) the
adoption of a new rate structure as of 2012, based on conclusions from the study; and (viii) a
10 percent adjustment for industrial rates as of April 2012, and for household rates later in the
year; and (ix) expansion of production capacity by bringing in independent producers.
35.
The government plans to increase crude oil and gas production. To encourage oil
companies to invest in crude oil and gas exploration and production, the government intends, in
the first quarter of 2012, to introduce significant amendments and reforms to the Hydrocarbon
Code and the Standard Contract for Hydrocarbon Production Sharing.
36.
Reforms and investments will be made to revitalize the water sector. The government
will respect its financial commitments to SODECI so that it can ensure the supply of drinking

53
water to the population. To this end, it has paid the securitized debt maturing in 2011 and intends
to clear end-2010 arrears, and since June 2011 it has resumed monthly payments. For its part, the
concessionaire must improve the recovery rate for water billing, particularly in the former CNO
zones, and replenish the development fund.
37.
The government intends to keep the wage bill under control. With respect to
streamlining the wage bill, it will be necessary to contain it while taking into account the needs of
the social and the security sectors, in order to free up fiscal room for investment. The financial
difficulties intrinsic to the post-election crisis preclude full implementation of the measures set
forth in the strategy note for controlling the wage bill be adopted in May 2010. The government
plans to update the strategy before March 2012, and will reprogram the payment of outstanding
balances from prior commitments to professional organizations. Similarly, the authorities will
take advantage of the census of government officials and employees, as well as the rationalization
of recruitment in the public administration. The combined effect of a rationalization of staffing
levels and an increase in government revenues should make possible a gradual reduction in the
ratio of the wage bill to revenues.
38.
The government intends to continue the efficient management of its personnel. The
census of government officials and agents recommenced in June 2011 and will be completed in
the fourth quarter of 2011 with the establishment of the Single Reference File for the public
administration. This file will be used in the Integrated Management System for Government
Officials and Agents (SIGFAE), which is expected to be finalized in the course of 2012. To make
the public administration more efficient, the government will create an Observatory of Public
Services and will create the positions of General Secretaries in the Ministries. As well, the
government plans to raise the retirement age for certain categories of government officials and
agents from 57 to 62 years, as of January 2012, for the purpose, among others, of ensuring the
financial viability of the CGRAE.
39.
The reform of the public and private sector pension systems will be finalized. The
draft law reforming the CNPS and draft implementing regulations have been prepared for
adoption by the government before the end of 2011. With respect to the CGRAE, the discussions
undertaken by the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Reform of the Public Pension Regime
(CIRPP/CGRAE) with the various partners led to draft reforms that will be adopted by the
government before the end of 2011.
40.
The action plan for public finance management based on the PEMFAR (Public
Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability Review) will be pursued. The
following progress is planned, by strategic pillar:


To improve the legal and institutional framework, the government intends to finalize and
adopt the six WAEMU directives in the Council of Ministers by the end of March 2012.
The installation of the National Assembly and voting on the draft texts, should permit the
transposition of these directives into national law no later than September 2012.

54


On fiscal discipline, the government intends to streamline its recourse to Treasury
advances, in accordance with the provisions of Decree 178/Cab-01/20 of March 13, 2009,
and to make continued use of the advances management module launched in September
2011 and the budget amendments management module starting with the 2012 budget.



On public procurement, the government intends provide training for civil servant and
private suppliers to the government on, in particular, the new Public Procurement Code, to
ensure a sound understanding of the new texts governing public procurement in
Côte d’Ivoire. The government also intends to continue to reinforce the capacity of the
National Regulatory Authority for Public Procurement (Autorité Nationale de Régulation
des Marchés Publics (ANRMP)).



On processing VAT credits, the government will establish a joint State/private sector
structure known as the “VAT Credits Reimbursement Monitoring Committee,” chaired by
the General Inspectorate of Finance, by December 31, 2011. The committee will be
responsible for coordinating, planning and evaluating the monitoring of VAT credit
reimbursement. The government will take the measures necessary to keep the stock of
new VAT credits, beginning 2012, below CFAF 10 billion; the old stock, evaluated and
validated by the joint committee, will be the object of separate treatment.

41.
The government will continue to promote regional integration. To maximize the
benefit of its membership in WAEMU and ECOWAS, the government will give priority to the
reforms initiated by those institutions. In this regard, it intends to continue to undertake the work
related to the fiscal transition, which will shift the burden of taxation gradually from border levies
to the domestic taxation. This will allow it to prepare for the impact of signing the regional
Economic Partnership Agreements (EPA), in the negotiation of which the government has been
heavily involved. In addition, emphasis will also be given to expanding the Common External
Tariff (CET) at the ECOWAS level.
42.
A medium-term debt management strategy will be prepared with technical
assistance from the IMF and World Bank. Achievement of the Completion Point under the
HIPC initiative will allow Côte d’Ivoire to obtain substantial relief on its external debt. To be able
to take full advantage of that relief and to ensure payment of future external debt service, the
government will work with its technical and financial partners, in particular the IMF and World
Bank, to prepare an action plan leading to a medium-term public debt management strategy to be
adopted in 2012. To this end, it intends to adopt the new public debt management framework
consistent with WAEMU directives, to ensure an integrated and sound management of public
debt. In addition, the government will institute beginning in 2012 a program to strengthen its
capacity to analyze the sustainability of the debt, to use simulation techniques, and to use
instruments for mobilizing savings, and will submit a request to participate in the medium-term
debt strategy (MTDS) project of the World Bank and the IMF.

55
IV.

FINANCING AND MONITORING OF THE PROGRAM

43.
The government believes that the program for 2011 can be entirely financed, but
there is still a financing need for 2012. The financing needs for the 2011 program have been
considerable. To meet those needs, the government has received emergency support from the
French Development Agency, the African Development Bank, the IMF and the World Bank. The
portfolio of projects with development partners has also been reactivated. Pending the
restructuring of its debt to the Paris Club, to private holders of the “Eurobond2032” and to other
private creditors, the government will have to accumulate further external arrears. The
government intends to cover its residual needs primarily by borrowing on the domestic and
regional markets.
44.
To meet its financing needs for 2012, the government is counting on support from
various sources, in particular its multilateral and bilateral partners. The government intends
to conclude a restructuring agreement with the Paris Club. It will also resume payment of current
maturities to holders of the “Eurobond 2032” in 2012, and intends to conclude an agreement on a
treatment for arrears accumulated between December 2010 and December 2011. The government
has opened negotiations with non-Paris Club bilateral creditors and with other commercial
creditors (Standard Bank – BNI and Sphynx) on comparable terms to the Paris Club. It also hopes
to obtain budgetary support from multilateral institutions (IMF, World Bank and AfDB) and from
bilateral partners. The government intends to cover the financing gap primarily through
borrowing on the WAEMU markets.
45.
The government intends to remain play major role in the monetary and financial
markets, but with a preference for the medium and long term. Following the restructuring of
government securities in 2011, the government will define before August 2012 a market
intervention strategy, which would involve restricting domestic borrowing backed by public
securities.
46.
The program will remain subject to semi-annual monitoring by the IMF Executive
Board on the basis of the quantitative indicators and structural benchmarks shown in
Tables 2–3 and defined in the attached Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU).
The semi-annual reviews will be based on end-June and end-December test dates. The first year
of the program covers July 2011-June 2012, and the first (second) program review will be based
on end-December 2011 (end-June 2012) performance criteria and is scheduled to be completed by
April/May (October/November) 2012. In particular, the government undertakes:


To refrain from accumulating new domestic arrears and from any form of advance on
revenues, and to refrain from contracting nonconcessional external borrowing other than
the borrowing specified in the TMU;



With respect to any new domestic financing, to issue public securities by auction through
the BCEAO or by means of any other form of competitive call for tenders on the local
financial market and on the WAEMU market, and to consult with Fund staff;

56


Not to introduce or increase restrictions on payments and transfers pertaining to current
international transactions, to introduce multiple currency practices, to enter into any
bilateral payment agreements not in conformity with Article VIII of the IMF Articles of
Agreement, or to impose or intensify any import restrictions for balance of payments
purposes;



To adopt any additional financial and structural measures that may prove necessary to
ensure the success of its policies, in consultation with the IMF.
V. STATISTICS AND CAPACITY BUILDING

47.
The government intends to continue its efforts to improve the statistical system, with
a view to ensuring the regular production of quality economic and financial data. In this
context, the government will update the draft master plan for statistics, taking account of
short-term developments and new guidelines, before end-March 2012.
48.
Côte d’Ivoire will continue its efforts to strengthen the capacities of the government,
particularly in those areas affected by the crisis. The government will continue to benefit from
assistance from the IMF and other development partners to: (i) strengthen the tax and customs
administrations; (ii) improve training for staff in producing the data needed to prepare the TOFE;
(iii) assist in implementing the fiscal reform plan; (iv) improve the national accounts, with a view
to constructing a social accounting matrix; (v) enhance external and domestic public debt
management; (vi) formulate a strategy for the financial sector; and (vii) relaunch the
macroeconomic modeling project.

A first report was prepared in August 2010 by the
Reform Committee for adoption by the government. The
new government is examining the report and has made a
new reform proposal. This proposal was provided to the
strategic partners in the sector nationally and
internationally at end-September 2011. The consultation
process will be broadened to other partners in order to

ATTACHMENT II—CÔTE D’IVOIRE: TECHNICAL MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
Arrangement Under the Extended Credit Facility
2011–14
October 20, 2011
1.
This Technical Memorandum of Understanding describes the quantitative and
structural indicators established by the Ivoirien authorities and the staff of the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) to monitor the program supported by the Extended Credit Facility
(ECF). It also specifies the periodicity and deadlines for transmission of data to the staff of
the IMF for monitoring purposes. Unless otherwise specified, the government is defined as
the central government of Côte d’Ivoire, including the National Social Security Fund (Caisse
Nationale de Prévoyance Sociale, CNPS) and the Civil Service Pension Fund (Caisse
Générale de Retraite des Agents de l’Etat, CGRAE), and Treasury operations for public
companies in liquidation; it does not include any local government, the Central Bank of West
African States (BCEAO), or any government-owned entity with separate legal status.
I.

PERFORMANCE CRITERIA AND INDICATIVE TARGETS

2.
For monitoring purposes, the performance criteria (PC) and indicative targets (IT) are
set for December 31, 2011 and June 30, 2012; there are indicative targets for these variables
for September 30, 2011, and March 31, 2012.
Performance criteria (PC) include:
(a) a floor on the overall fiscal balance (including grants);
(b) a ceiling for net domestic financing (including the issuance of securities on the
WAEMU financial market);
(c) a zero ceiling on new nonconcessional external debt;
(d) a zero ceiling for the accumulation of new external arrears;
(e) a zero ceiling for the accumulation of new domestic arrears.
Indicative targets (IT) include:
(a) a floor on the primary basic fiscal balance;
(b) a ceiling on expenditures by treasury advance;
(c) a floor on “pro-poor” expenditures;

67
(d) a floor on the net reduction of government amounts payable; and
(e) a floor on total government revenue.
3.
The PCs, ITs, and adjustors are calculated as the cumulative change from
June 30, 2011 for 2011 targets, and from December 31, 2011 for 2012 targets (Table 2 of the
Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies, MEFP).
A. Government Revenue (IT)
4.
Total government revenue is defined as revenue collected by the Tax Administration
(DGI), the Directorate-General of the Treasury and Public Accounting (DGTCP), and the
Customs Administration (DGD), the CNPS, and the CGRAE; and other nontax revenue as
defined in the fiscal reporting table (TOFE).
B. Pro-Poor Expenditures (IT)
5.
Pro-poor expenditures are defined in Table 1 and are derived from a detailed list of
“pro-poor” expenditures produced in the SIFBUD /SIGFIP system.
C. Treasury Advances (IT)
6.
Within the framework of the program, Treasury advances are defined as spending
paid for by the Treasury outside normal execution and control procedures, and which have
not been subject to prior commitment and authorization. They exclude the ‘régies d’avance,’
externally-financed expenditure, wages, subsidies and transfers, and debt service as set out
through ministerial decree. The cumulative amount of expenditures by treasury advance as
defined by the program will not exceed cumulative quarterly ceilings representing 10 percent
of quarterly budget allocations (excluding externally-financed expenditures, wages, subsidies
and transfers, and debt service). The nominative and restrictive list of expenditures eligible
as treasury advances is as defined by ministerial decree no. 178/CAB-01/26 of
March 13, 2009.
D. Primary Basic Balance (IT)
7.
The primary basic balance is the difference between the government’s budgetary
revenue (excluding grants) and total expenditure plus net lending, excluding interest
payments, externally-financed capital expenditure (on a payment order basis for all
expenditure items):
Tax and nontax revenue – {Expenditure + Net lending – Interest payments-Foreign financed
capital expenditure (on a payment order basis for all expenditure items)}

68
E. Overall Fiscal Balance (including grants) (PC)
8.
The overall fiscal balance is the difference between the government’s budgetary
revenue (including grants except World Bank budget support grants and AfDB budget
support grants) and total expenditure plus net lending (on a payment order basis):
{Tax and nontax revenue + (Grants – World Bank budget support grants – AfDB budget
support grants)} – {Expenditure + Net lending (on a payment order basis)}
9.
The floor on the overall fiscal balance will be adjusted downward (upward) for an
excess (shortfall) of project loans relative to the programmed amount.
F. Net Domestic Financing (PC)
10.
Domestic financing by the central government is defined as the issuance of all debt
instruments in CFAF to domestic creditors and the WAEMU financial market, borrowing
from the BCEAO (including drawings from the IMF), and the contraction of any kind of
other liability in CFAF toward these creditors. The program ceiling on net domestic
financing applies to net amounts of domestic/WAEMU borrowing defined as the gross
amount of domestic/WAEMU borrowing less amortization during the period under
consideration. This ceiling includes a margin of CFAF 10 billion above the net cumulative
flow projected for each quarter.
Net domestic financing = Domestic financing (from Fiscal Operations of the Central
Government) –Net change in balances outstanding + Treasury loans from abroad (WAEMU)
+ Treasury bills placed abroad (WAEMU)+ Treasury bonds placed abroad (WAEMU)+ IMF
drawings + residual gap
11.
This ceiling does not apply to new agreements on restructuring domestic debt and
securitization of domestic arrears, nor to new BOAD and BIDC project loans. For any new
borrowing over and above a cumulative amount of CFAF 35 billion over each of years 2011
and 2012, the government undertakes not to issue government securities except by auction
through the BCEAO or through public auction (appel d’offres compétitif) on the domestic or
WAEMU financial markets registered with the Regional Council for Public Savings and
Financial Markets (CREPMF), in consultation with Fund staff.
G. New Nonconcessional External Debt (PC)
12.
The quantitative performance criterion concerning external debt applies to all
nonconcessional external debt, irrespective of maturity, and whether it has been contracted or
guaranteed by the government.1 It applies not only to the debt as defined above, but also to
commitments contracted or guaranteed for which no value has been received. This
performance criterion does not apply to:

69


normal import-related commercial debts having a maturity of less than one year;



rescheduling agreements;



debts to the West African Development Bank (BOAD) loans up to the equivalent of
CFAF 25 billion or debts to the ECOWAS Bank of Investment and Development
(BIDC), up to the equivalent of CFAF 20 billion;



drawings on the IMF; and



CFAF-denominated government securities (or CFAF-denominated debt contracted or
guaranteed by the government) which are initially purchased (or contracted) by
WAEMU residents.

13.
A debt is considered concessional if its grant element is at least 35 percent, the net
present value (NPV) of the debt being calculated using a discount rate based on the average
of the OECD's Commercial Interest Reference Rates (CIRRs) over the last ten years for debt
with a maturity of at least 15 years. For debt with a maturity of less than 15 years, the NPV is
based on the average CIRRs of the preceding 6-month period (February 15 to August 14 or
August 15 to February 14). The same margins for differing repayment periods are added to
both the 10-year and 6-month averages (0.75 percentage point for repayment periods of less
than 15 years, 1 percentage point for 15 to 19 years, 1.15 percentage points for 20 to
29 years, and 1.25 percentage points for 30 years or more).
14.
The government undertakes not to contract or guarantee nonconcessional external
debt under the conditions defined in ¶13 and 14, with the exception of debt constituting
rescheduling of maturities. In this regard, the government undertakes to consult with IMF
staff on terms and concessionality of proposed new debt in advance of contracting such
external debt.
H. External Payment Arrears (PC)
15.
External arrears are considered to be the nonpayment of any interest or principal
amounts on their due dates (taking into account relevant contractual grace periods, if any).
This performance criterion applies to arrears accumulated under external debt of the

1

External debt is defined in “Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to External Debt in Fund
Arrangements,” Executive Board Decision No. 6230–(79/140), as amended by Executive Board Decision
No 14416–(09/91) on August 31, 2009. External debt is defined on the basis of residency. However, for the
assessment of the program, debt issued by Ivoirien entities in CFA francs and held by residents of the the
member countries of the WAEMU zone shall not be considered to be external debt.

70
government and external debt guaranteed by the government for which the guarantee has
been called by creditors, consistent with the definitions under the external debt performance
criterion (paragraph 13). This performance criterion is monitored on a continuous basis.
Excluded from this performance criterion are:


Arrears accumulated under external debt contracted with official bilateral creditors
covered under the Paris Club Agreed Minute of May 2009 or any new Paris Club
rescheduling or restructuring, as well as such debts to non-Paris Club bilateral official
creditors that are subject to restructuring.



Arrears accumulated under:
i) the Eurobonds 2032,
ii) the BNI-Standard Bank (London) 2007 and 2008 notes, and
iii) the Sphynx Capital Markets 2007 and 2008 notes.
I. Amounts Payable, Including Domestic Payment Arrears (IT and PC)

16.
The “amounts payable” (or “balance outstanding”) comprise domestic payment
arrears and domestic floating debt and represent the government’s overdue obligations. They
are defined as expenditures accrued (engagées et liquidées), validated (visées par le
contrôleur financier), subject to payment order (ordonnancées), but not paid. These include
bills due and not paid to public and private enterprises, but exclude domestic debt service
(principal and interest). For program purposes, domestic payment arrears are those balances
outstanding for which the payment delay exceeds the time frame for payment stipulated by
the administrative regulations in force (90 days). The floating debt is those balances
outstanding for which the payment delay does not exceed the time frame for payment
stipulated by the administrative regulations in force (90 days). The balances outstanding are
broken down by payer/type, as well as by maturity and length of overdue period (< 90 days,
90–365 days, > 1 year). For example, at end-2010, the “balances outstanding” amounted to
CFAF 183 billion, the floating debt to CFAF 114 billion, and the arrears to CFAF 69 billion.
17.
In general, the stock of floating debt will not exceed three months’ worth of current
operating expenditure (excluding utilities) and investment expenditure financed from own
resources. For example, in 2010, the quarterly amount of such expenditure amounted to
CFAF 106 billion, and the floating debt was CFAF 114 billion.
18.
Within the framework of the program, the government will (i) undertake a cash
reduction of CFAF 11.8 billion in 2011 in the amounts payable, and CFAF 30 billion in
2012; and (ii) not accumulate new domestic payment arrears on the current budget from
July 1, 2011 and the next budget from January 1, 2012.

II. MEMORANDUM ITEMS
A.

Net Bank Credit to the Government

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
CÔTE D’IVOIRE
Joint Debt Sustainability Analysis Under the Debt Sustainability Framework for
Low-Income Countries1
Prepared by the Staffs of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund
Approved by Roger Nord and Thomas Dorsey (IMF)
Jeffrey D. Lewis and Marcelo Giugale (IDA)
October 20, 2011
Côte d’Ivoire is in debt distress as evidenced by the accumulation of external debt service
arrears. Under the external debt sustainability analysis (DSA) baseline scenario, the present
value (PV) of debt-to-GDP, PV of debt-to-exports, and PV of debt-to-revenue are projected
to stay above their indicative thresholds over the next few years. Under alternative scenarios
assuming full delivery of HIPC and MDRI debt relief at the Completion Point and beyond
HIPC debt relief after the Completion Point, the debt burden would become sustainable and
all indicators would improve significantly. The inclusion of domestic debt raises debt burden
indicators somewhat, but does not alter the assessment. As the initial debt level is high, the
debt position of the country remains vulnerable to macroeconomic shocks, indicating the
need for prudent fiscal policies and debt management.
I. BACKGROUND
1.
The last DSA for Côte d’Ivoire,2 considered by the Board in July 2011 in the
context of the RCF request, assessed Côte d’Ivoire as being in debt distress.3 That
1

The DSA was prepared jointly by the staffs of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, in
collaboration with the authorities of Côte d’Ivoire. The fiscal year in Côte d’Ivoire is January–December.

The last DSA can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/cat/longres.aspx?sk=25069.0.

The DSAs presented in this document are based on the low-income countries (LIC) DSA framework. Under
the Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA), Côte d'Ivoire is rated as a weak performer with an
average rating of 2.72 in 2008–10, and the DSA uses the indicative threshold indicators for countries in this
category. See “Debt Sustainability in Low-Income Countries: Proposal for an Operational Framework and
Policy Implications” (http://www.imf.org/external/np/pdr/sustain/2004/020304.htm and IDA/SECM2004/0035,
2/3/04) and “Debt Sustainability in Low-Income Countries: Further Considerations on an Operational
Framework, Policy Implications” http://www.imf.org/external/np/pdr/sustain/2004/091004.htm and
IDA/SECM2004/0629, 9/10/04) and “A Review of Some Aspects of the Low-Income Country Debt
Sustainability Framework” (http://www.imf.org/external/np/pp/eng/2009/080509a.pdf) and “Staff Guidance
Note on the Application of the Joint Bank-Fund Debt Sustainability Framework for Low-Income Countries”
(http://www.imf.org/external/np/pp/eng/2010/012210.pdf).

2
assessment is unchanged in this DSA, although the present analysis finds slightly improving
debt dynamics over the next five years as Côte d’Ivoire is expected to negotiate a new
Paris Club agreement, following the approval of the proposed new ECF arrangement with the
Fund.4 The Paris Club agreement would allow the clearance of external debt service arrears
accumulated since December 2010, and provide debt relief on existing debt service falling
due during the consolidation period (Box 1).
Box 1: What Has Changed Compared to the LIC DSA of July 2011?
The main differences between the assumptions made in the previous DSA undertaken at the time of
the approval of the 2011 RCF disbursement and present DSA are:


A new ECF arrangement is assumed in the baseline and alternative scenarios, with access of
120 percent of quota. Previously, a new ECF arrangement was included only in the alternative
scenarios.



A new Paris Club agreement in the baseline as well as other scenarios; previously, a new Paris
Club agreement was included only in the alternative scenarios.



This agreement would cover debt service falling due during 2012–14 and arrears at end-2011. It
is assumed that terms of the agreement would be similar to those under the May 2009 Paris Club
agreement. Comparable terms are assumed for other creditors. The third year
(April 2011–March 2012) of the May 2009 agreement did not come into force because of the
lapse of the program under the 2009 ECF arrangement.



New external debt service arrears have been accumulated since December 2010 as a result of the
political crisis (December 2010–April 2011) and its economic impact. The government cleared
arrears to the World Bank and AfDB and other multilateral creditors during May–July 2011, and
has contacted other creditors to reach agreement on a restructuring of arrears and resumption of
debt service falling due.



An adjusted baseline scenario was introduced with more realistic new financing assumptions
than the baseline, i.e., it assumes nonconcessional borrowing in amounts similar to the
alternative scenarios presented in section IV, and thus shows more clearly the effect of debt
relief than a comparison to the baseline scenario.

2.
External public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) debt has fallen due to debt
restructuring. At end-2008, Côte d’Ivoire’s external public debt stood at $13.4 billion
(62 percent of GDP) of which $5 billion was in arrears, but by end-2010, this debt had fallen
to $11.6 billion (51 percent of GDP or just over 80 percent of total public debt) and arrears
had dropped to $0.3 billion. This reflected arrears clearance under the May 2009 Paris Club
restructuring agreement and the successful Brady Bond exchange in April 2010.

3.
Domestic public debt is owed to various creditors. At June 2011, the stock of
public domestic debt amounted to 14.5 percent of GDP, mostly consisting of government
securities (8.9 percent of GDP) issued in the regional bond market or to settle past domestic
arrears.
II. BASELINE ASSUMPTIONS
4.
The macroeconomic assumptions of the baseline scenario are similar to those of
the last LIC DSA, except for the treatment of the debt to the Paris Club (Box 2). The
baseline assumes further political stabilization, sound macroeconomic management, prudent
borrowing policies, and advancement in structural reforms over the medium term. It also
assumes a high level of new borrowing to finance the high level of investment needed to
achieve the long-run growth potential of Côte d’Ivoire. The ability of the country to access
the volume of external resources needed, however, would be greater with attainment of the
HIPC Completion Point as discussed in the alternative scenarios.

4
Box 2. Macroeconomic Assumptions for 2011–31
Real GDP growth: The post-election crisis of 2010–11 reduced real GDP growth to 2.4 percent in 2010,
and is expected to result in a real GDP decline of -5.8 percent in 2011. Investor confidence is assumed to
rise with political normalization over the next few years. Growth is expected to reach 8.5 percent in 2012,
and average 5.7 percent over 2013–16 and 5 percent over 2017–31 in line with the PRSP projections.
Inflation: Inflation, as measured by the GDP deflator (in U.S. dollars), is expected to stabilize around
3 percent. This is in line with the CPI inflation, which by WAEMU rules should not exceed 3 percent.
Fiscal policy: In the medium term, the government expects to achieve a primary basic surplus of
0.7 percent of GDP. Total revenues (excluding grants) are projected to increase to 20.3 percent of GDP in
2016 and 22.5 percent of GDP by 2031. Government expenditures are projected to increase to
23.9 percent of GDP in 2016 and 25.3 percent of GDP by 2031. Capital spending would rise gradually
from 3.1 percent in 2010 to 6.4 percent of GDP in 2016 and 8.4 percent of GDP in 2031.
External financing: The current DSA assumes similar levels of new financing as in the June 2011 LIC
DSA to support the higher investments need and the assumed growth rate. For the baseline scenario only
concessional borrowing is assumed in the absence of a HIPC Completion Point. Grants are expected to
stabilize at 1.0 percent of GDP.
External current account: The balance (excluding official transfers) is expected to decline from a
surplus of 0.4 percent of GDP in 2010 to a deficit of 5.3 percent of GDP in 2016. The deficit would reach
6.5 percent in 2031, with an average of 4.4 percent of GDP over the period 2017–31. After declining in
2010, export volumes are expected to further decrease in 2011, and then increase on average by
5.7 percent per year thereafter. Import volumes are expected to grow annually by 6.2 percent, after a
decline in 2010 and further expected decline in 2011. Import dynamics reflect essentially the higher levels
of investment.
The debt service falling due and arrears to official bilateral creditors and commercial creditors are
assumed to be restructured in 2012, as described in Box 1. FDI is assumed to rise gradually over the
projection period in the face of structural rigidities. Net inflows of FDI are projected to rise from
1.5 percent of GDP in 2010 to 2.9 percent in 2016, and 4.2 percent in 2031.



Growth is expected to accelerate sharply. Following the severe downturn in 2011
owing to the impact of the post-election crisis during late 2010-early 2011, economic
activity is assumed to return to pre-crisis levels in 2012. This assumes investor
confidence returns as the economy continues to recover following the post-election crisis,
re-establishment of law and order, political normalization and successful parliamentary
elections at end-2011. The economic stagnation of the last 10 years has created
substantial investment needs in infrastructure and many other sectors. Meeting these
needs would, amongst other factors, require access to sizeable external borrowing, as
well as an increase in FDI. Public and private investment is thus projected to pick up and
support growth. The growth rate is projected to increase to 8.5 percent in 2012, then ease

5
gradually to 5.2 percent in 2016, before stabilizing around 5 percent in the long run.5 The
long-run assumption reflects the strategic economic role of Côte d’Ivoire in the West
African region, the growth prospects of other countries in the region, and the potential of
the country. The productivity of the new investments (essentially financed by new
borrowing) will affect the capacity of the country to repay its debt and the sustainability
of its debt position.


A new Paris Club agreement is assumed covering the period 2012–14. This would
provide additional debt relief not assumed in the baseline scenario in the June 2011 LIC
DSA. In the June DSA a new Paris Club agreement was included only in the alternative
scenarios.



Only concessional external financing is assumed. In the absence of a HIPC
Completion Point, Côte d’Ivoire would remain at high risk of debt distress and the
country should not borrow on nonconcessional terms. Therefore, the sizeable external
financing needs are assumed to be filled only with concessional resources. Access to
such funding would be difficult, however, absent a HIPC Completion Point and the
persistence of debt vulnerabilities.
III. EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY UNDER THE BASELINE SCENARIO

5.
Under the baseline scenario, some of Côte d’Ivoire’s external debt burden
indicators remain above their indicative thresholds in the medium term (Table 1a,
Figure 1). The PV of public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) external debt, estimated at
46.6 percent of GDP in 2010, stays above the 30 percent indicative target until 2015.
Compared to the last LIC DSA however, the levels of PPG external debt are much lower
through 2014, reflecting the debt relief from the assumed new Paris Club agreement. As in
the last DSA all new borrowing is assumed to be on concessional terms. The availability of
concessional resources on the scale assumed in baseline is not necessarily assured
underlining the importance of debt relief, including under the HIPC Initiative, to create space
for new borrowing on nonconcessional terms so that Côte d’Ivoire could achieve its
medium-term investment and growth objectives. The PV of PPG external debt-to-revenue
ratio moves below the 200 percent indicative threshold in 2013, and the PV of external
debt-to-exports moves below its indicative target from 2011 (as compared to 2012 under the
June 2011 LIC DSA) reflecting lower levels of external debt in 2012.
6.
Debt service ratios remain below their indicative targets due to high export and
revenue levels, as well as lower debt service, following the assumed new Paris Club
agreement. However, they would rise modestly from their current levels in the medium
term, then decline before stabilizing at their long-term levels. The dynamics of the debt
5

These medium-term growth assumptions are different from those in the LIC DSA at the HIPC Decision Point
in March 2009 (http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/cat/longres.cfm?sk=23033.0).

6
service ratios reflect three factors: (i) the end of the consolidation period under the new
Paris Club agreement and the subsequent rise in debt service after 2014; (ii) the profile of
debt service on the Eurobonds, which begins to rise in 2012 for several years; and (iii) the
start of debt service payments on the emergency 2011 loan from France.
7.
Stress tests6 reveal considerable vulnerabilities of the external debt outlook in
the baseline scenario (Table 1b, Figure 1). The tests yield high levels of debt and debt
service compared to the baseline scenario. The country is most vulnerable to a one-time
30 percent devaluation in 2012; this shock would raise the PV of debt-to-GDP, the PV of
debt-to-revenue and the debt-service-to revenue ratio relative to their baseline by 10, 44, and
3 percentage points, respectively by the end of the projection period. If non-debt creating
flows (transfers/grants) were one standard deviation lower in 2012–13, the PV of
debt-to-exports would be higher than the baseline value by 7 percentage points at the end of
the projection period.
IV. PUBLIC SECTOR DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
8.
When domestic public debt is included in the analysis, Côte d’Ivoire’s debt
indicators deteriorate modestly but follow similar patterns as those of external public
debt (Table 2a, Figure 2). Under the baseline scenario, the overall debt indicators would fall
in the long run, reflecting the projected improvement of the macroeconomic situation.
However, the increasing recourse to domestic financing could prove costly. The availability
of liquidity on the regional debt market is limited, and this could push interest rates up from
their current levels (6.5 percent on government debt).
9.
The public debt position is vulnerable to shocks (Table 2b, Figure 2). In particular,
lower GDP growth is the most damaging shock. This results from the combination of lower
nominal GDP, a higher value of the debt stock and higher debt service.
V. EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY UNDER ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS WITH FURTHER
DEBT RELIEF

A. Assumptions of the Alternative Scenarios
10.
Staff has examined three alternative scenarios: first, a baseline with an
alternative composition of new financing (adjusted baseline); second, HIPC and MDRI
relief; and third, HIPC/MDRI, as well as additional bilateral relief beyond

6

The sensitivity analysis of Côte d’Ivoire’s external debt vulnerability includes setting key macroeconomic
variables at their historical levels. However, given the distortions in trend caused by the civil conflict, the
analysis is based on regional averages and standard deviations for all relevant indicators. In addition to the
historical scenario, the sensitivity analysis includes standard tests on new public borrowing on less favorable
terms, a one-time 30 percent nominal depreciation of the CFAF in 2012, a reduction in official and private
transfers, in GDP growth, in GDP deflator, and in exports.

7
HIPC/MDRI.7 A comparison of the adjusted baseline and the latter two alternative scenarios
demonstrates clearly the impact of debt relief, by eliminating the influence of a shift in the
composition of financing (relative to the original baseline) on the debt ratios. Côte d’Ivoire is
projected to reach the HIPC Completion Point by the third quarter of 2012, assuming the
country maintains a good macroeconomic track record, has a new ECF arrangement in place
in late 2011, and the structural reform program remains on track.
11.
The alternative scenarios assume the same level of new borrowing as the
baseline, but assume that concessional resources are available only on a much smaller
scale. In the baseline, the level of access to concessional borrowing is assumed to be at a
fairly high level because, in the absence of the debt relief expected when Côte d’Ivoire
reaches the enhanced HIPC Initiative Completion Point, it would not have the debt servicing
capacity to access nonconcessional resources. However, under the alternative scenarios, after
completion point debt relief Côte d’Ivoire should have space for new borrowing, including
on nonconcessional terms, in order to finance its sizeable investment needs. Therefore, the
alternative scenarios assume a much lower level of borrowing from concessional resources
and a rising recourse to nonconcessional borrowing starting 2013, with shorter maturity
(6 years) and grace periods (1 year) and higher interest rates.8 At the same time, the sustained
growth projected in the next few years would push the country to middle-income status; as a
result, IDA lending terms would harden (essentially 20 instead of 40 years maturity). In
effect, the expected improvement in the debt position after completion point debt relief
would strengthen the country’s ability to access sufficient resources (including on
nonconcessional terms) to finance its sizeable investment needs and hence provide greater
certainty that the projected growth rate would be achieved.
B. Impact of the Alternative Scenarios on Debt Sustainability for Côte d’Ivoire
12.
Côte d’Ivoire’s external debt position would improve significantly when HIPC
and MDRI debt relief is obtained (Figure 3). Debt stock ratios would immediately fall and
then remain below their critical levels, notwithstanding sizeable commercial borrowing.9

7

Provided by official bilateral creditors; the bulk of claims are held by the French development assistance
agency (AFD). The projected relief is based on treatments provided in other HIPC Completion Point cases. In
the case of the AFD, it is assumed that debt relief on post-cutoff date ODA debt will come in the form of aid for
development under the C2D (contrat de désendettement et de développement). Under this treatment
Côte d’Ivoire would continue to pay debt service on an agreed schedule, which would then be returned as a
grant to be used for development projects. It is assumed that the stock of eligible debt is repaid over 15 years in
equal tranches.

8

The grant element of new borrowing is negative under the alternative scenarios (Figure 3a.), as the interest rate
on commercial borrowing (8 percent) is higher than the discount rate (4 percent).

9

Although only concessional borrowing is assumed under the baseline, the debt stock ratios under the baseline
scenario are above those of the alternative scenarios in the long run because with longer maturities and grace
periods under the baseline, the repayment of new borrowing starts much later.

8
13.
Côte d’Ivoire’s external debt position would improve further if additional
bilateral debt relief beyond HIPC is obtained. In the medium term, all debt stock and debt
service ratios would be much lower as compared to the HIPC and MDRI debt relief only, and
none of the ratios will breach their thresholds. In the long run the ratios will be similar in all
alternative scenarios.
VI. PUBLIC DEBT MANAGEMENT
14.
The authorities have requested Fund and Bank support in preparing a public
debt management strategy. The strategy will take into account the medium-term budgets
prepared or under preparation in various sectors (education, health, agriculture, and
transportation).
VII. CONCLUSIONS
15.
Côte d’Ivoire is in debt distress as evidenced by the accumulation of external
debt service arrears, despite improvements in the debt position of the country since the
decision point. Under the external debt sustainability analysis (DSA) baseline scenario, the
PV of debt-to-GDP, the PV of debt-to-exports, and the PV of debt-to-revenue are projected
to stay above their indicative thresholds over the next few years before falling below these
thresholds over the projection period. Stress tests indicate vulnerabilities in the external debt
position, involving persistent breaching of the thresholds for some indicators. However, debt
service indicators are below their indicative thresholds under the baseline, though they are
expected to rise in the medium term. The inclusion of domestic debt does not alter the
assessment, even though it raises debt burden indicators moderately.
16.
A sustainable external debt position can be achieved through debt relief and
sound macroeconomic policies. Debt relief under the HIPC Initiative, MDRI and beyond
HIPC bilateral assistance significantly improves Côte d’Ivoire’s external debt burden in
the short and medium term. It also provides space for Côte d’Ivoire to access some
nonconcessional financing, increasing its ability to address its significant public investment
needs and improving its growth prospects. However, the projected increase in debt service
immediately after the Completion Point highlights the need for careful cash flow planning
in budget execution and improved debt management, so as to avoid new payment arrears
and preserve the steady financing of programs critical for growth and poverty reduction.
Côte d’Ivoire remains vulnerable to various macroeconomic shocks. This highlights the
need to pursue policies conducive to high growth, solid exports, good fiscal performance,
and prudent debt management.
17.
The Ivoirien authorities welcomed the opportunity to contribute to the DSA.10
They raised concerns about the ability of the country to mobilize and absorb the foreign
resources necessary to fulfill the large investments needed to support the country’s growth
objectives. They appreciated the DSA as a tool to highlight the post-completion point
challenges that Côte d’Ivoire is likely to face: increased debt service and the large
investments/financial flows needed to sustain the projected growth.
10

Preliminary results were discussed with the authorities in Abidjan, in September 2011. Staffs of the
International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the African Development Bank took part in the discussions.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

When a member has overdue financial obligations outstanding for more than three months, the amount of
such arrears will be shown in this section.
3
Assistance committed under the original framework is expressed in net present value (NPV) terms at the
completion point, and assistance committed under the enhanced framework is expressed in NPV terms at
the decision point. Hence these two amounts cannot be added.
4
Under the enhanced framework, an additional disbursement is made at the completion point
corresponding to interest income earned on the amount committed at the decision point but not disbursed
during the interim period.

VIII. Implementation of Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI): Not Applicable
Decision point - point at which the IMF and the World Bank determine whether a country
qualifies for assistance under the HIPC Initiative and decide on the amount of assistance to
be committed.
Interim assistance - amount disbursed to a country during the period between decision and
completion points, up to 20 percent annually and 60 percent in total of the assistance
committed at the decision point (or 25 percent and 75 percent, respectively, in exceptional
circumstances).
Completion point - point at which a country receives the remaining balance of its assistance
committed at the decision point, together with an additional disbursement of interest income
as defined in footnote 2 above. The timing of the completion point is linked to the
implementation of pre-agreed key structural reforms (i.e., floating completion point).
IX. Safeguards Assessments:
The Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) is the common central bank of the
countries of the West African Economic and Monetary Union, which includes Côte d'Ivoire.
The most recent safeguards assessment of the BCEAO was completed on March 1, 2010. The
2010 update assessment found that the BCEAO continues to have controls in place at the
operational level. The overall governance framework needed nonetheless to be strengthened
by the addition of an audit committee to ensure that the Board of Directors exercises
appropriate oversight over the control structure, including the audit mechanisms and
financial statements. The Institutional Reform of the WAMU and the BCEAO completed
after the approval of the safeguards report stipulated creation of the Audit Committee, which
should now start working. Efforts to implement fully the International Financial Reporting
Standards reporting framework should also be pursued.

Exchange Arrangements:

Côte d’Ivoire is a member of the WAEMU; the exchange system, common to all members of
the union, is free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current international
transactions. The common currency, the CFA franc, is pegged to the euro at the rate of
€1 = CFAF 655.957.
XI.

Article IV Consultation:

Côte d’Ivoire is on the standard 12-month Article IV consultation cycle. The Executive
Board completed the 2009 consultation in November 2009.

AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK (AFDB) GROUP OPERATIONS AND STRATEGY IN
CÔTE D’IVOIRE
Bank Group Portfolio:
Since it started operations in Côte d'Ivoire in 1971, the AfDB has so far approved
59 operations for the country, of which 41 have been fully completed, 14 cancelled,
3 ongoing and 1 newly approved. All approved operations amount to a net commitment of
UA 1,258.6 million (CFA F 946.4 billion), with 66.2% from the ADB window, 23.1% from
the ADF and 10.7 % from the Nigeria Trust Fund. AfDB Group-financed operations have
been mainly loan-based and channeled, by order of importance, to the rural development and
agriculture sector (26.2%), infrastructure (20.7%), multi-sector (17%), the social sector
(16.5%) and energy, water and telecommunications (15.6%). The operations were financed
mainly with resources from the ADB window (70%). The bulk of these funds (94.4%) was
directed towards the public sector. It should be noted that funding for the private sector
concerns electricity, telecommunications, transport and industry. In addition to bilateral
funding, Côte d'Ivoire received additional ADF resources to finance studies and/or projects
in the fields of infrastructure and agriculture, to enhance subregional integration in West
Africa.
With the first political/military crisis of 2002, Côte d'Ivoire was placed under Bank sanctions
from February 2003 to early March 2009 due to arrears accumulation. Nevertheless, dialogue
was maintained with the Ivoirien authorities. A Bank reengagement strategy was defined in
the Global Country Strategy Note approved in March 2009 which covered 2009–10. The
clearance of arrears from the support received from the Bank helped the country to reach the
HIPC Initiative Decision Point. The Bank had already increased its support to the country in
February 2008. The last review of the Bank’s portfolio occurred in 2010, nearly fourteen
years after that of 1996. Considering the long period of inactivity of the portfolio (six years)
due to the suspension of disbursements to the country, the Bank: (i) streamlined the portfolio
by cancelling the outstanding balance of eight old operations; and (ii) recently, in early June
2011, has restructured two other operations (PADER-Moyen-Comoé and PVRH) (70% of
the balance of these two operations was used as a contribution to the new budget support
operation approved on June 3, 2011 by the Board of Directors). With the prospects of
resumption of activity, particularly the restoration of government services through the
proposed budget support, the portfolio will be improved.
The table below gives an overview of Bank’s portfolio status in Côte d’Ivoire.

place in June, 2011 and the effective
launch of the project is expected in
October 2011.
The main purpose of this program,
approved on June 3, 2011, is to
contribute in the national budget to
restoring basic social and administrative
services, social cohesion and
reconciliation as stated in the
Government’s request. The program
seeks to address the country’s urgent
needs through the restoration of basic
health, educational and social welfare
services, water and sanitation networks,
public administration services, as well as
dialogue, social cohesion and
reconciliation mechanisms. The budget
support of UA 95 million has been
disbursed. The UA 5.5 remaining is
reserved for capacity building and will be
disbursed as the needs arise on
government’s requests.

Strategy for reengagement by AfDB in Côte d’Ivoire:
To assist Côte d’Ivoire in addressing its immense needs, the Bank is committed to a rapid
operational re-engagement. Consistent with the AfDB’s Fragile States Facility, a Country
Brief defines the framework for the Bank’s rapid re-engagement in Côte d’Ivoire over the
period 2011–12. The proposed strategy, in consultation with the Ivoirien authorities,
consists of two pillars: (i) restoring infrastructure and basic social services; and
(ii) improving governance and capacity building. The long years of political instability as
well as recent clashes and looting had negative impacts on social infrastructure, installations
and facilities. Substantial efforts are necessary to restore the supply of basic social services.
A full Country Strategy Paper is planned for the period 2013–17 to assist the country with its
quest for strong and inclusive growth.
Considering the urgent needs, particularly with regard to access to basic social and
administrative services, restoring the functioning of the public service and fostering social
cohesion and peace, the approved country brief 2011–12 has proposed that the following
operations be prepared in order of priority:

CÔTE D’IVOIRE—STASTICAL ISSUES
As of October 2011
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. There are
weaknesses in the areas of national accounts and balance of payments and public finance statistics, as well
as in the reconciliation of fiscal and monetary data. Generally, the authorities provided the required
statistical indicators to the Fund (see attached table) on a timely basis.
National Accounts: Comprehensive national accounts data for 1996 onwards is compiled in line with the
1993 System of National Accounts methodologies, using 1996 as the base year. As the base year is dated,
technical assistance has been provided by AFRITAC West to implement a new base year and update
implicit deflators.
Price statistics: A harmonized consumer price index (CPI) has been adopted by all WAEMU members. A
new base year (2008) has been adopted in 2010.
Labor market statistics: No such statistics are published regularly.
Government finance statistics: The authorities provide annual data on the budgetary central government
for publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook. While no monthly or quarterly fiscal data
are provided for publication, they are made available to the IMF African Department, although metadata
is lacking. The authorities have committed to address weaknesses in coverage of general government units
and public enterprises and are making efforts to improve the reconciliation of fiscal and monetary data. In
addition, the authorities are seeking the assistance of Afritac to improve the compilation of government
finance statistics.
Monetary and financial sector statistics: Monetary data for Côte d’Ivoire are prepared by the national
agency of the BCEAO and officially released by BCEAO headquarters. Some shortcomings of the
monetary statistics are common to all eight member countries of the WAEMU, while others relate to
systemic issues in Côte d’Ivoire’s bank and nonbank financing of the operations of the central government
and the rest of the public sector. Recently there have been improvements in the timeliness of reporting
data on depository corporations and interest rates. Following the shutdown of the banking system during
the post-election crisis (February–April 2011), the central bank and private banks are struggling to
establish a thorough account of damages they sustained.
External sector statistics: The national agency of the BCEAO in Abidjan is responsible for compiling
and disseminating annual balance of payments statistics and the international investment position.
BCEAO headquarters delineates the methodology and calculates international reserves managed for
WAEMU countries. With respect to merchandise trade, the customs computer system allows for
satisfactory monitoring of trade data, but the coverage of services and transfers, and particularly workers
remittances, has shortcomings. Concerning the financial accounts, foreign assets of the private
nonbanking sector are not adequately covered, while reporting of private capital flows, especially foreign
direct investment in Côte d’Ivoire, is weak. There is also not sufficient information on private debt stocks
and debt service flows.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Côte d’Ivoire has participated in the General Data
Dissemination System (GDDS) since May 2000, and
has posted the metadata on the Data Standards
Bulletin Board.

No data ROSC is available.

III. Reporting to STA

Côte d’Ivoire regularly reports data to STA for re-dissemination in IMF statistical publications.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
November 10, 2011

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2011 Article IV Consultation with
Côte d'Ivoire
On November 4, 2011, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the 2011 Article IV consultation with Côte d'Ivoire.1
Background
Côte d’Ivoire is emerging from a decade-long sociopolitical crisis that has held back
economic growth. In particular, growth has been constrained by low investment and a poor
business environment. As a result, per capita income fell by about one-sixth in the past ten
years and almost half the population was living below the poverty line in 2010.
In 2009, Côte d’Ivoire adopted an economic and financial program supported by a
three-year Extended Credit Facility (ECF) arrangement with the aim of ensuring a stable
macroeconomic framework, promoting sustained growth, and reducing poverty. Debt relief
in support of the ECF arrangement and the Decision Point under the Heavily Indebted Poor
Countries (HIPC) Initiative, which was reached in 2009, restructured arrears and reduced
the debt service burden. Broadly satisfactory progress was made in implementing this
program in 2009–10. Economic growth accelerated to 3.8 percent in 2009—driven by the
secondary and tertiary sector—before slowing down to 2.4 in 2010 due to an electricity
crisis, a decline in crude oil production, and uncertainty linked to the election process.
Inflation remained moderate at below 2 percent. The fiscal deficit averaged 2 percent of
gross domestic product (GDP), and the external current account recorded a surplus, albeit
declining.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of
the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to
the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found
here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
Following the end of the post-election crisis, the new government quickly put in place an
economic recovery program and started the process of sociopolitical normalization. The
reunification of the country is moving forward with the formation of new mixed security
forces, and the redeployment of the public administration in the former Center-North-West
zones. Security has improved considerably, but further efforts are needed. Parliamentary
elections are scheduled for mid-December 2011, and a Truth and Reconciliation
Commission has been set up to rebuild and consolidate social cohesion.
Economic activity appears to be recovering faster than expected; inflation receded from its
April spike to 4½ percent in June-August, and fiscal performance has been stronger than
anticipated.
The authorities’ medium-term priorities are to achieve high and sustained growth, reduce
poverty, create jobs (for youth in particular), and establish fiscal and external sustainability.
These objectives are in line with the 2009–13 Poverty Reduction Strategy that the
government plans to update following broad-based consultations. They form the basis of
the program supported by a new three-year ECF arrangement that would help the country
advance toward the HIPC Completion Point. The medium-term outlook is conditional on
further progress in the security situation and political normalization, as well as the
implementation of structural reforms to remove impediments to economic growth.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended Côte d’Ivoire’s rapid progress in reviving the economy,
restoring a functioning public administration, and improving security following the
post-election crisis. Nevertheless, they noted that major economic and political challenges
remain. They encouraged the authorities to continue to pursue national reconciliation,
security sector reform, and sound economic policies, in order to consolidate peace, fully
restore law and order, and lay the foundation for sustained and inclusive economic growth.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ good performance under the economic recovery
program, especially the prudent budgetary stance. They endorsed the authorities’
comprehensive and ambitious new medium-term economic program, particularly its
emphasis on social services, peace building, and job creation. They stressed that decisive
implementation will be critical to achieve the objectives of sustained economic growth,
poverty reduction, and fiscal and debt sustainability, while acknowledging the significant
risks to the program.
Directors considered the fiscal program to be an appropriate balance between fiscal
prudence and the need for higher investment and social spending. They emphasized the
importance of broadening the tax base, limiting current spending, and strengthening tax
and expenditure administration in order to create the fiscal space needed for the higher
investment and social spending. Directors welcomed the intention not to commit
expenditures until the financing has been obtained.

3
Directors gave high priority to financial sector deepening and strengthening to support private
sector development. They highlighted the need to improve banking supervision and restore
the banking sector’s capacity to intermediate savings and provide credit to small and
medium-sized enterprises. They also urged quick action to address the vulnerabilities of
state-owned banks.
Directors welcomed the proposed reforms in the energy and the coffee/cocoa sectors. They
noted that a significant effort will be needed to place the energy sector on a sound financial
footing. Directors stressed the importance of governance and other reforms, including the
new investment code, to improve the business climate and enhance external
competitiveness.
Directors urged the authorities to take steps to reach the completion point under the HIPC
Initiative as early as possible, and to maintain debt sustainability thereafter. They
encouraged development of a debt management strategy to guide future borrowing, with
IMF and World Bank technical assistance.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency
of the IMF's views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent
of the country (or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board
discussions of Article IV consultations with member countries, of its surveillance of
developments at the regional level, of post-program monitoring, and of ex-post
assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements. PINs are also
issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

IMF Executive Board Approves Three-Year, US$615.9 Million Extended Credit
Facility Arrangement and Additional Interim Debt Relief for Côte d'Ivoire
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today approved a three-year
arrangement for Côte d’Ivoire under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF)1 in an amount
equivalent to SDR 390.24 million (about US$615.9 million), representing 120 percent of
Côte d’Ivoire’s quota in the IMF. Approval makes immediately available a first disbursement
of an amount equivalent to SDR 81.3 million (about US$128.3 million). The Executive
Board also approved an amount equivalent to SDR 5.04 million (about US$8 million) in
interim assistance for Côte d’Ivoire under the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries
(HIPC) Initiative, representing relief on debt service pending irrevocable debt relief when the
country reaches the HIPC completion point. The Executive Board also concluded the Article
IV consultations with Côte d’Ivoire, which will be covered in a separate Public Information
Notice.
Côte d’Ivoire is recovering from a prolonged sociopolitical crisis that led to widespread
violence and a sharp decline in economic activity in early 2011. Since late-April 2011, the
new government has embarked on an ambitious investment-led recovery. The IMF approved
financial support of an amount equivalent to SDR 81.3 million (about US$128 million) under
the Rapid Credit Facility in July (see Press Release No. 11/272). The recovery has picked up
pace, and projected decline in real gross domestic product (GDP) was reduced in September
to a 5.8 percent contraction from 6.3 percent previously. Real GDP is expected to bounce
back with growth of 8–9 percent in 2012.

The Extended Credit Facility (ECF) has replaced the Poverty Reduction and Growth
Facility (PRGF) as the Fund’s main tool for medium-term financial support to low-income
countries by providing a higher level of access to financing, more concessional terms,
enhanced flexibility in program design features, and more focused streamlined
conditionality. Financing under the ECF carries a zero interest rate, with a grace period of
5½ years, and a final maturity of 10 years (http://www.imf.org/external/np/exr/facts/ecf.htm).
The Fund reviews the level of interest rates for all concessional facilities every two years.

Côte d’Ivoire reached the decision point under the HIPC Initiative on March 31, 2009 (see
Press Release No. 09/104) and could qualify for irrevocable debt relief on the vast majority
of its external debts through the HIPC and Multilateral Debt Relief initiatives in 2012 once it
completes the so-called completion point triggers. These include key structural and social
reforms, including in the areas of public financial management, debt management and
governance, and the coffee and cocoa sector, alongside standard HIPC requirements of
implementing a national poverty reduction strategy and satisfactory implementation of the
government’s ECF-supported economic program. Reaching the HIPC completion point will
reduce Côte d’Ivoire’s external debt to a sustainable level. The authorities have requested
technical assistance from the IMF and the World Bank to formulate a comprehensive debt
management strategy, and intend to set up a national debt agency in line with West African
Economic and Monetary Union guidelines.
Following the Executive Board’s discussion of Côte d’Ivoire, Mr. Min Zhu, Deputy
Managing Director and Acting Chair, made the following statement:
“Côte d’Ivoire’s economy is recovering faster than anticipated, following a severe
post-election crisis that caused a sharp decline in activity in the first four months of the year.
Real GDP is now expected to decline by slightly less than 6 percent in 2011. Inflation is
receding from its peak in April, although it remains above its pre-2011 trend. The financial
sector, weakened by the damages the economy sustained during the crisis, is fully
operational again. Performance to date under the authorities’ 2011 program supported under
the IMF’s Rapid Credit Facility has been good.
“The authorities’ new medium-term economic program, which is being supported under the
IMF’s Extended Credit Facility, aims to fully restore law and order and to consolidate peace
through economic growth and job creation, in particular for the youth. The economy is
expected to rebound in 2012, and the authorities’ ambitious and broad investment and
structural reform plans are expected to help maintain a robust growth path over the medium
term.
“The fiscal program for 2011–12 is realistic in the face of continued large uncertainties. The
emphasis on investment is appropriate. Expenditures will remain relatively high, while
revenues will still reflect the impact of the post-election crisis. Over the medium term,
implementation of the authorities’ structural reform program is expected to improve the
business climate and tax administration, and create the fiscal space needed to support
investment and allow the country renewed access to foreign direct investment and other
foreign financing.”

Statement by Kossi Assimaidou, Executive Director for Côte d’Ivoire
November 4, 2011
My Ivoirien authorities are grateful to Fund staff for the fruitful discussions held in Abidjan
in September 2011. The threefold discussion--which includes assessment of the Rapid Credit
Facility program, Article IV consultation and background work for a new ECF-supported
program--provided the opportunity to exchange views on a broad array of issues regarding
the country’s economic prospects and reform challenges.
Côte d’Ivoire has come a long way from prolonged political tensions, and my authorities
appreciate the prompt support of traditional partners and the international community in
general immediately following the end of the post-election crisis, which has helped weather
its most severe effects. My authorities have made progress in improving the security situation
although it remains less favorable in some rural areas. The work to rebuild a new army to
help with restoring stability and security is going on. The Dialogue, Truth and Reconciliation
Commission (CDVR) is fully constituted and has begun contacts with various opinion
leaders in the country to lay the ground for its consultations with all parties. The process of
national reconciliation, along with the upcoming legislative elections (planned for
December 2011) and the recovery of the economy, should help consolidate the peace.
The RCF-supported program and the related financial assistance have contributed to
restoring public administration, meeting urgent social needs, improving security and assisting
the private sector in revamping its production capacity. At this juncture, my authorities
consider a comprehensive medium-term program as the appropriate framework to set
ambitious goals and re-ignite structural reforms with the view to further unleashing the
country’s growth potential. Furthermore, realizing high and sustained growth is key to
curbing the crisis-worsened poverty profile, addressing unemployment especially among the
youth, and helping create favorable conditions for national reconciliation.
Implementing key fiscal and structural reforms in the framework of a medium-term program,
and reaching the HIPC Completion Point are important milestones in my Ivoirien authorities’
agenda towards alleviating the debt burden, creating the necessary space for increased
infrastructure investment, sustaining growth, and launching a longer term development
strategy. The support of the international community will be critical in this regard, and my
authorities request the approval of a three-year arrangement under the ECF and additional
interim assistance under the Enhanced HIPC Initiative. They also highly value the technical
assistance from the Fund and the World Bank which they have requested notably in the areas
of public financial management, debt management, and financial sector development.
I.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS UNDER THE RCF

Côte d’Ivoire has performed well under the RCF-supported program and my authorities
welcome staff’s favorable assessment of their achievements over the recent period. The
steadfast actions taken by the authorities helped turn the downward trending of growth. The
projected decline in real GDP for 2011 was thus revised in September from -6.3 percent to
-5.8 percent, with further improvement expected by year-end. This positive development was

2
driven by a quick recovery in industrial production, stronger agricultural production and
mining output. Early inflation pressures have abated and annual inflation fell from over
9 percent to 4.5 percent in June-August.
The government has taken actions on many fronts for a quick recovery in all sectors. Budget
execution was in line with the objectives of the RCF-supported program, notably with
revenue exceeding the June target. Spending was kept under check and non essential outlays
were cut. The authorities almost completed the re-equipment of public services and extended
substantial support to the private sector by diverse means. The government continued the
rollover of Treasury bills through October, and also started the restructuring of domestic
debt. The authorities have also launched the ground work for key structural reforms planned
for the medium-term agenda, including in the financial sector, the energy sector, and the
business environment.
II. THE NEW ECF PROGRAM AND MEDIUM-TERM CHALLENGES
My authorities are requesting IMF support under the ECF. The objectives of the program are
in line with their priorities, and include notably:
Investing in sustained growth. After a decade-long conflict and huge resources devoted to
financing crisis-related operations, my Ivoirien authorities have placed their medium-term
agenda towards redirecting public expenditure to growth-enhancing investments. With real
output expected to bounce back to 8-9 percent in 2012, the draft budget thus allocates more
than CFA F 600 billion (5 percent of GDP) to capital spending, more than double compared
to the 2011 level. The authorities are committed to significantly increasing capital outlays
over the medium term, once necessary effort are made in 2012 to restore some basic public
services, including re-equipping government services and rehabilitating basic infrastructure.
Aiming fiscal sustainability. My authorities’ fiscal policy for the period ahead will be geared
toward the objectives of enhancing revenue to finance investment and create more space for
poverty reduction. In this regard, the government is expecting a recovery in revenue
temporarily lost due to the post-election crisis including taxes on corporate profits.
Furthermore, my authorities will implement measures to strengthen tax and customs
administrations, streamline tax exemptions, and fight tax evasion and fraud. In the same vein,
tax and customs administrations have increased their number of branches especially in the
Center-North-West zones, which should help enhance government revenue. To improve the
budget deficit over the medium term, the authorities are determined to entrench the effort of
reducing current spending as signaled under the 2012 budget.
Reaching the HIPC completion point. My authorities’ plan to realize long-term fiscal
sustainability entails also a decisive improvement in the debt situation. Côte d’Ivoire’s
engagement in the HIPC process has been a protracted one. Over the past decade especially,
much resources have been devoted to the implementation of the triggers, and important
reforms have been initiated. During his recent visit to the Fund, Côte d’Ivoire’s President,
H.E. Alassane Ouattara reaffirmed the authorities’ strong determination to reach the

3
Completion Point at the earliest possible in 2012. My authorities appreciate staff assessment
that progress on the bulk of the triggers is advanced.
Strengthening the financial sector. In their strategy to make the private sector a key actor
and the main source of employment, my authorities are committed to deepening the financial
sector and place it on a sound footing, with the view to making credit flow into the economy.
In that regard, the national office of the central bank, BCEAO, is completing a thorough
assessment of the post-crisis situation of banks and financial institutions. This work will help
my authorities conduct their comprehensive financial sector reform aimed at lifting the
bottlenecks that impede the financing of the private sector especially SMEs. As regards the
state-owned banks, my authorities have taken urgent measures, including appointing new
management teams, to stop the losses while working on strategies to divest them from public
ownership. Strengthening the microfinance sector is also part of my authorities’ plan to
broaden access to credit, especially for unbanked segments of the populations. Moreover,
efforts to help build strong financial institutions such as raising the minimum capital will be
pursued.
Addressing long-stalling structural reforms. My authorities place a particular emphasis on
addressing the imbalances in the energy sector, with the aim of availing abundant and
lost-cost electricity to the private sector and to households over the medium term. In this
regard, they have unveiled an incremental approach of bringing financial balance to the
sector. A negotiation agenda has been set, starting from the stakeholders that contribute the
most to the imbalances in the sector. Before year-end, the authorities intend to conclude
discussions with gas producers and the electricity company, and to adjust electricity prices.
As regards, the civil service, the reform is advanced and key steps of census, the setting a
Single Reference File for civil servants, and an integrated personnel management system
(SIGFAE) are due at year-end. The ultimate goal remains to create a transparent file for all
public service personnel to be accounted for and hence help the government adopt an
informed strategy to curb the wage bill over the medium term.
Improving the business climate. My Ivoirien authorities are cognizant of the efforts needed
to improve the business climate to enable the private sector to play a greater role in the
economy and attract more private investments. The government is working on various fronts
in this regard. In particular, an important agenda of revamping the national physical
infrastructure network is underway. The judicial system is undergoing major changes,
starting by appointing new judges to the important institutions. Actions have also begun to
enhance competition, with the design of a new investment code and a competition law. The
authorities are also working on measures to reduce red tape and facilitate business start-ups,
including creating a one-stop shop. These actions are being topped by a campaign by the
highest authorities to reposition Côte d’Ivoire as a first-class destination for investors, and by
efforts to renew relationships with key partners. In this vein, my authorities welcome the
renewal by the US authorities of the AGOA eligibility for Côte d’Ivoire, on
October 25, 2011.

CONCLUSION
The RCF-supported program has helped Côte d’Ivoire dampen the effects of a costly
post-election crisis. The financial support provided by the donor community in this
framework has been instrumental in getting the basics right and in paving the way for a more
ambitious medium-term agenda. My Ivoirien authorities are committed to working
steadfastly towards improving security, and law and order. They will also endeavor in
furthering national reconciliation for lasting peace and political stability.
My authorities view these developments as necessary conditions to mobilize domestic
resources for building a broad-based economy. The reform agenda set forth for the period
ahead will ignite the growth momentum and contribute to create employment opportunities
for crisis-hit populations. My authorities view the ECF framework as suitable to their
agenda, and I would appreciate Board support for their ECF request, which will help
Côte d’Ivoire cope with the challenging endeavors ahead.
