EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background
•

The economic recovery that started in 2004 continued in 2007, with non-oil GDP
growth in excess of 5 percent. This has been aided by progress in implementing reforms
and higher regional demand for Syrian non-oil exports. Oil output, however, remained
on a downward trend. The fiscal and external deficits widened slightly to stillsustainable levels, and the level of official net foreign assets remained comfortable.

•

The impact of adverse global and regional developments currently underway on the
Syrian economy are expected to be relatively moderate in the short term. The effects
are likely to be through weakening FDI, remittances, and demand for Syrian exports
from the Gulf region.

•

The medium-term outlook is expected to improve as the global and regional
economies begin to recover, with non-oil growth accelerating to about 6.5 percent by
2013. The fiscal and external and current account deficits are projected to stabilize at
about 3 and 4 percent, respectively. This positive outlook is contingent on perseverance
in advancing fiscal and structural reforms and an improvement in global conditions over
the medium term.

Key policy issues and recommendations
•

Further fiscal consolidation is necessary. It is essential to further reduce petroleum
subsidies, advance the preparatory work to launch the VAT in 2010, and continue to
restrain public expenditure, while encouraging public-private partnership agreements,
with adequate safeguards, for investment in infrastructure.

•

The 2008 FSAP identified financial sector reform priorities in the period ahead.
These include the need to audit and restructure state banks; build up regulatory and
supervisory capacity and strengthen enforcement of regulations; and enhance the
monetary policy framework by modernizing the central bank and developing indirect
monetary policy instruments.

•

The switch of the de jure peg from the dollar to the SDR is appropriate for Syria. A
gradual increase in exchange rate flexibility would be beneficial, but would need to be
preceded by the development of indirect monetary policy tools.

•

Efforts to transition toward a market-based economy should continue. Enhancing
the business environment by modernizing and streamlining the regulatory framework,
and further liberalizing trade would help enhance medium-term growth prospects.

4
I. BACKGROUND AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
1.
Global political and economic ties have been strengthened in recent years.
Relations with the EU have improved recently following the establishment of diplomatic
relations with Lebanon. Subsequently, France, which currently chairs the EU, issued positive
signals regarding the ratification of the association agreement with Syria. However, the large
number of Iraqi refugees in Syria continues to pose economic and social challenges. While
their presence has contributed to growth, the refugees have put a strain on public
expenditures for petroleum and food subsidies, education, health, and utilities. As the
refugees run down their savings, they may seek work and add pressure to the labor market.
2.
Syria’s overall macroeconomic performance has remained strong. Non-oil GDP
growth is estimated to have been about
6 percent in 2007 despite unfavorable

construction and services maintained their
rapid expansion. Overall growth is expected to be about 5 percent. Inflation accelerated in
2008 to 17–20 percent by mid-2008, up from a reported 5 percent in 2007. It is, however,
expected to decline in the fourth quarter of 2008, in line with international food prices, and is
projected to average about 15 percent for the year.
Projection

3.
While the overall fiscal deficit increased to about 3.5 percent of GDP in 2007, the
non-oil deficit improved slightly. Oil revenue decreased by about 2 percent of GDP. Nonoil receipts also declined, partly reflecting the reduction in customs tariffs. Current and
capital outlays were reduced by about one percent of GDP in total. This was achieved despite
the pressure on budgetary expenditure arising from the large number of Iraqi refugees.
4.
The fiscal deficit is expected to stabilize in 2008 mainly as a result of the
reduction in fuel subsidies. The authorities launched a program to phase out petroleum
subsidies in May 2008. Gasoline and diesel prices were increased by 33 and 240 percent,
respectively. To mitigate the impact of the diesel price increase, the authorities issued
coupons to all Syrian households that would allow them to purchase diesel up to 1,000 liters

5
per household at 9 SYP/liter.1 The price of fuel oil, which is used by large industrial
establishments and power plants, was raised by 33 percent in December, 2008. These price
increases and overall expenditure restraint led to a further small narrowing of the non-oil
deficit despite the continued decline in customs revenue resulting from the full year effect of
the 2007 reduction in tariffs.
5.
The external current account deficit is expected to widen to about 4 percent of
GDP in 2008, from 3.3 percent in 2007. The net oil balance (after subtracting the share of
foreign partners) turned negative due to declining output and rising domestic consumption.
However, non-oil exports, tourism, and remittances grew rapidly as a result of strong
regional demand and the relaxation of foreign exchange controls. Net official foreign assets
have been stable at about $17 billion (10 months of imports). The real effective exchange rate
of the Syrian pound appreciated by 4 percent in 2007, and about 9 percent in the first three
quarters of 2008 due to the combined effect of rising inflation and the pound’s nominal
appreciation against the dollar.
6.
Broad money has been growing in line with nominal GDP. This growth mainly
reflected domestic credit expansion. Credit to public enterprises grew by about 40 percent in
2007 and by 60 percent in the first half of 2008 (y-o-y), reflecting the rising financing needs
of enterprises providing fuel and other subsidies. Growth of credit to the private sector was
about 20 percent in 2007 and is expected to register 25 percent in 2008. Interest rates
remained low, and became largely negative in real terms with the rise in inflation in 2008.
7.
Financial intermediation continues to be low by regional standards. Credit to the
private sector has been at about

300
15 percent of GDP since 2005. Broad

These coupons covered about 4.4 million tons, roughly the amount of local production of diesel. However, the
cost of oil subsidy increased due to the sharp rise in international prices during the first eight months of 2008.

Box 1. The Rise and Fall of Oil in the Syrian Economy
Substantial oil discoveries were made in Syria during 1970–1990s. Oil production increased from
about 250 thousand barrels per day (bpd) in the mid 1980s to almost 650 thousand bpd in 1995. As a
result, oil’s contribution to GDP, fiscal revenue, and exports, reached 34, 35, and 65 percent,
respectively, in that year.
However, Syria has less oil reserves than most of the regional oil exporters. As of October 2008,
Syria’s proven oil reserves of 2.5 billion barrels were equivalent to about half of Oman’s reserves and
less than 3 percent of Kuwait’s reserves.

Since 1995, Syria’s oil production has been on a downward trend and domestic energy consumption
has been increasing. Consequently, Syria became a net oil importer again starting in 2007. In that year,
the “overall oil balance,” which is the net oil trade balance minus payments made to the foreign oil
companies, showed a deficit of 2.4 percent of GDP.
In an attempt to reverse these trends, the authorities have stepped up their efforts since the early
2000s to increase exploration in Syria. Successive bidding rounds were launched on over 20 blocks in
the country. The arrival in the last four years of a large number of independent oil companies has helped
slow down the decline in production. However, the authorities expect production to continue declining in
the coming years, bottoming out at about 300,000 bpd by 2025 and remaining constant thereafter. At
these production levels, current recoverable reserves would be depleted by 2030.

8.
Private banks are well capitalized. Their overall capital adequacy ratio was reported
at about 13 percent in mid-2008, compared to the Central Bank of Syria’s (CBS) minimum
requirement of 12 percent. Nonperforming loans (NPLs) are reported at about 5 percent of
total loans for all banks at end-2007. Data on public banks loan classification remain weak,
hindering a meaningful calculation of their capital adequacy or NPLs ratios (Box 2).

8
Box 2. Key Findings and Recommendations of the 2008 FSAP
The financial system is still dominated by state banks, which hold 80 percent of bank assets. Private
banks have grown rapidly since having been first licensed in 2004. Licensing of private insurance
companies started in 2005. A stock market will be opened in 2009. The payment and settlement system
needs strengthening.
The CBS lacks effective monetary policy tools and independence. There are no bills to conduct open
market operations and no standing facilities. Furthermore, the CBS does not have full control over
international reserves, a substantial part of which is held by the Commercial Bank of Syria (CBoS).
A basic supervisory and regulatory framework is in place, but enforcement needs strengthening.
The CBS should enhance supervision of public banks.
The assessment of the soundness of the banking system is hampered by serious data deficiencies in
public banks. Private banks and the CBoS are well-capitalized, but profitability is generally low. Public
banks’ financial statements are not audited according to international standards.
Risks for public banks could arise from possibly weak balance sheets and low capitalization, poor
underlying profitability, and outdated business practices. For private banks, risks could result from
their recent rapid growth, entry into new untested business lines, and high loan concentration in bank
portfolios.
The key FSAP recommendations are: (i) accelerate CBS modernization and reform, including by
enhancing its research capacity, strengthening financial sector risk management, developing the debt
market, and transferring the official foreign exchange reserves held by the CBoS to the CBS; (ii) develop
systemic liquidity management by creating money and foreign exchange instruments and markets;
(iii) build up adequate regulatory and supervisory capacity; and (iv) conduct a comprehensive diagnostic
audit for state banks, produce reliable financial soundness indicators for these banks, and restructure
them.

II. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
9.
The policy discussions focused on: (i) fiscal policies and reforms needed to
compensate for the decline in oil revenue; (ii) monetary and exchange rate policy; and
(iii) structural reforms aimed at enhancing the medium-term growth outlook, with emphasis
on the financial sector.
A. Outlook and Risks
10.
The near-term growth outlook is expected to be only mildly influenced by the
current adverse global conditions. The worsening of international financial conditions does
not appear to have affected Syria’s financial sector, given its limited integration with the
global system and with CBS regulations strictly limiting banks’ foreign exposure. However,
Syria is likely to be indirectly affected by a regional slowdown resulting from global
financial linkages with other countries in the region, notably with the Gulf; FDI, worker

9
remittances, and demand for Syrian exports from these countries may decline.2 Non-oil
growth is therefore projected to slow down by about one percentage point (to around
5 percent) over the next two years.3 The external current account is expected to narrow
slightly as the decline in oil prices should reduce the cost of net petroleum imports. The fiscal
deficit is projected to narrow due to the reduction in fuel subsidies.
11.
The medium-term outlook is expected to improve as the global and regional
economies begin to recover. Non-oil
Figure 4. Syrian Arab Republic: Medium Term Outlook, 2004-13
GDP could accelerate gradually to
15
6.5 percent by 2013. The external current
10
account deficit is projected to stabilize at
about 4 percent of GDP, and the fiscal
5
deficit at about 3 percent. However, this
outlook is subject to considerable

B. Fiscal Policy
12.
The authorities aim to continue to improve the non-oil fiscal balance, in order to
adjust to the reduction in oil output. To this end, they are determined to fully eliminate the
fuel subsidies by 2010. It has not been decided yet whether distribution of fuel coupons
would continue in the coming years. The authorities are aware that a secondary market has
developed for illegal trading in these coupons. They are, therefore, giving consideration to
moving to a form of targeted cash transfers. The authorities also intend to continue to restrain
both current and capital outlays. To this end, preliminary information on the 2009 budget
indicate a small reduction in expenditure in real terms.

2

The impact of adverse regional conditions on Syria is expected to be relatively mild due to the fact that
inflows from the region had not grown in line with the rise in oil prices and remain at a low base. For example,
workers’ remittances into Syria grew since 2005 by an annual average of less than 3 percent. FDI and tourism
inflows are projected at about $2 billion and $3.5 billion, respectively in 2008. These levels are below the
potential of Syria, which remains a relatively less costly destination for FDI and tourism by regional and global
standards.

3

This non-oil growth projection reflects a stronger slowdown in most sectors, other than agriculture, in
response to the weakening in the global outlook. On the other hand, agricultural output, which constitutes
around 25 percent of non-oil GDP, is projected to steadily rebound from the estimated cumulative reduction of
about 15 percent over the past two years.

10
13.
Good progress is being made in the preparatory work for the VAT. However, the
introduction of the VAT, which was initially planned for 2009, has been delayed until
January 2010. This was partly to avoid contributing to inflationary pressures in view of the
ongoing phasing out of fuel subsidies. The authorities are also keen to complete sufficient
preparatory work to ensure the readiness of tax administration and the public for the
introduction of the VAT.
14.
The authorities are aware of the need to improve public expenditure monitoring
and management. At present local authorities report their expenditures on a frequent basis
to the Central Accounting Authority, while the ministry of finance receives such information
with a considerable lag. Large quasi-fiscal operations, in particular to finance fuel and other
subsidies, are conducted through the banking system. The authorities agree that these
operations should be reduced. However, they felt that simply bringing them on-budget could
perversely soften their financing constraint. The ministry of finance believed that
streamlining these operations should be addressed in the context of an overall reform strategy
to reduce their size and modernize the subsidies system.
C. Monetary Policy and Financial Sector Reform
15.
There is excess liquidity in the banking system, and real interest rates have
become largely negative.4 The negative real interest rate, in the authorities’ view, is due to
the temporary high inflation rates. They also pointed out that the exchange rate peg limits the
scope for a significant differential between the interest rate on the pound and rates on
major currencies. In the meantime, the CBS increased the reserves requirement ratio from
5 percent to 10 percent in October, 2008, which would help mop up part of the excess
liquidity.5
16.
The authorities intend to continue their effort to enhance the monetary policy
framework. There are currently no indirect monetary policy instruments or standing
facilities. The CBS has recently held two trial auctions of treasury bills. Full fledged issues of
the bills are expected in 2009. If this plan gets delayed, the CBS would consider issuing its
own certificates of deposit. The authorities indicated that the transfer of international reserves
from the CBoS to CBS, in line with the FSAP recommendation, is expected to be completed
in 2009. The CBS has also embarked on a technical cooperation program with the Fund to
modernize its structure and enhance the payments system, with a view to improving its
ability to conduct monetary policy.

4

Interest rates on deposits are subject to rules effectively imposing a 5-11 percent band. There are indications
that depositors are seeking better returns in the informal credit market, which is illegal and not regulated.

5

Since required reserves are not remunerated, their increase is likely to lead to a widening of the spread
between the deposit and lending rates.

11
17.
The CBS sees strengthening bank supervision as a priority. In particular, off-site
surveillance techniques and methodologies to calculate capital adequacy measures are being
improved. Furthermore, efforts are underway to enhance the supervision of state banks.
These banks have started producing some key FSIs and reporting them to the CBS. In
addition, the free-zone banks will be brought under CBS supervision in 2009.
18.
Efforts are underway to enhance the framework for anti-money laundering and
combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT). A high level financial intelligence unit
has been created, assessment criteria have been tightened, and the scope of AML/CFT has
been extended to cover foreign currency changers, insurance companies, and brokerage
houses.
D. External Sector Issues
19.
The de jure exchange rate peg was switched from the dollar to the SDR in
August 2007.6 De facto, the pound has been trading within a narrow band against the SDR
and appreciated against the dollar by about 7 percent (as of end-September 2008).
Econometric estimates, which are not reliable because of data and methodological
shortcomings, suggest that the real exchange rate of the pound may be moderately
overvalued relative to its medium-term equilibrium level (Box 3).
20.
The authorities expressed their intention to remove the remaining foreign
exchange restrictions and multiple currency practices. They allowed the use of credit
cards to pay for foreign transactions starting in June 2008. They hoped to be in a position
to accept the obligations under Article VIII in the near future. To this end, they are
considering requesting a Fund TA mission to conduct a comprehensive review of the
exchange system.
21.
The authorities view the current exchange rate arrangement as appropriate
under current circumstances. They believe that preconditions to widen their policy options
with regard to the choice of the exchange regime could be in place gradually over the
medium term, with the development of indirect monetary policy instruments and a liquidity
management framework.

6

Significant progress toward exchange rate unification was made on January 1, 2007, with the abolition of the
“budget” rate.

12
Box 3. Exchange Rate Assessment
Econometric estimates suggest that the pound may be moderately overvalued in real effective
terms. However, these estimates, which utilized CGER methodologies,¹ are not reliable due to serious
data and methodological shortcomings.

results range from an undervaluation of 14
percent to an overvaluation of about 3.5 percent, depending on the assumptions used. The outcome
depends on whether the objective is to keep constant the annuity from oil wealth in real terms, in real
terms per capita, or as a percent of GDP.

E. Structural Reforms and Other Issues
22.
The authorities have been making progress in structural reform. In particular,
advances have been made in trade liberalization by substantially reducing the tariff schedule.
The export of strategic agricultural products, however, remains subject to government
approval. Trade liberalization has also continued in the context of bilateral and regional trade
agreements. The authorities’ future reform agenda includes the streamlining of agricultural

13
subsidies, introduction of a one-stop shop for company registration, incorporation of the
Syrian Telecommunication company, and creation of an independent regulatory body.
Notwithstanding these reforms, there is considerable scope to improve the business
environment, as indicated by the high cost of “doing business.”7 Areas identified for
improvement included modernizing the tax system, reducing bureaucratic discretion, and
further enhancing the legal framework.
23.
The authorities issued two decrees in 2008 to combat under-invoicing of imports.
The first decree allows the customs department to purchase imported goods at invoice prices.
The decision to buy the goods would be made by the Director General of the Customs
Department. The authorities hope that the existence of this decree will be sufficient to deter
underinvoicing, without customs actually having to intervene in this manner. The second
decree requires importers to open letters of credit through domestic banks. The
implementation of this latter decree is still on hold due to objections from the business
community.
24.
Serious shortcoming in economic and financial statistics continue to hamper
effective surveillance. Efforts are ongoing to improve the data situation, in the areas of
national accounts, balance of payments, and fiscal statistics. The timelines and quality of data
would also benefit from enhanced coordination between government agencies.
III. STAFF APPRAISAL
25.
Syria’s economic performance has been strong. Non-oil growth remained robust
despite the adverse impact of the severe drought on agriculture. The recent acceleration in
inflation was largely due to temporary increases in food and fuel prices. Inflation started to
decline in the second half of 2008. The fiscal and external current deficits has worsened only
moderately over the past two years despite the significant deterioration in the net oil balance.
This was made by the restraint on public expenditure, ongoing fuel subsidies reform, and
strong performance of non-oil exports, remittances, and tourism receipts.
26.
The impact of the adverse global and regional developments currently underway
on the Syrian economy are expected to be relatively mild in the short term. The effects
are likely be manifested through weakening FDI, remittances, and demand for Syrian exports
from the Gulf region. The medium-term outlook is then expected to improve as the global
and regional economies begin to recover. This generally positive outlook is contingent on
perseverance in advancing fiscal and structural reforms and a gradual recovery in agriculture
and in the global economy over the next two years.

7

Syria ranked 137 (out of 145) in the World Bank’s 2009 Doing Business Report.

14
27.
The non-oil deficit needs to be further reduced. It would be essential to consolidate
the nascent gains in turning around Syria’s fiscal outlook. This is crucial for preserving fiscal
sustainability, and is appropriate given the relatively mild impact of the global slowdown on
Syria’s growth outlook. Achieving this goal will require continued restraint on current
expenditures, notably wages and subsidies, and the prioritization of investment projects by
focusing on infrastructure. It will also be important to continue to encourage private sector
participation in these projects, including through private-public partnership agreements, with
adequate safeguards.
28.
The steps taken to reduce fuel subsidies have helped improve Syria’s fiscal
outlook. Staff encourages the authorities to maintain this progress, with a view to eliminating
these subsidies by 2010, while developing a well-targeted compensation scheme to mitigate
the impact on the poor.
29.
There is an urgent need to further enhance public expenditure management.
Priority should be given to improving the monitoring of expenditures at the regional level.
Establishing a single treasury account would help achieve this objective. It is also important
to reduce extra budgetary and quasi-fiscal operations that are conducted by public enterprises
and financed by the banking system. These operations should be brought on budget, and the
consolidated budget deficit should be primarily financed by treasury bills, the interest on
which should be market determined.
30.
Staff commends the authorities for the progress made in the preparatory work
for the VAT. Introducing the VAT by the new target date of 2010 would be important to
help offset the impact of the declining oil revenue on the budget. To ensure the success of the
VAT, staff encourages the authorities to (i) adopt a single rate with few exemptions; (ii) put
in place an adequate tax procedure code and information technology system; and (iii) ensure
that the existing large and medium taxpayer offices—which will administer the VAT —
report directly to the central Syrian Tax Commission. It is also important to advance other tax
reforms, particularly to simplify the income tax regime and the rationalize excises.
31.
The commitment to maintain a cautious monetary policy stance is welcome. In
this connection, public banks should be instructed to strictly limit directed lending. At the
same time, it is important to develop indirect monetary policy instruments and further
liberalize interest rates. If plans to launch market-based treasury bills are delayed, the CBS
should seek to issue its own certificates of deposit. Consideration should also be given to
establishing standing facilities at the CBS. Enhancing the CBS independence and giving it
control over all official international reserves would strengthen its ability to formulate and
implement monetary policy.
32.
The authorities’ early response to the 2008 FSAP recommendations is
commendable. The CBS has already started to address the existing shortcomings identified
in the FSAP, including by efforts to improve the supervision of state banks. Staff encourages

15
the CBS to continue its efforts in this regard. In particular, compliance with prudential
regulations by public banks needs to be enforced. All banks should be subject to annual
audits by independent firms, and provide timely information to the CBS, including financial
soundness indicators. In addition, priority should be given to restructuring state banks and to
ensuring that they operate on a commercial basis.
33.
The switch of the pound’s peg to the SDR is appropriate for the Syrian economy.
This arrangement provides a credible monetary anchor, while allowing some flexibility in the
pound’s exchange rate vis-à-vis major currencies. Econometric estimates suggest that the
pound may be moderately overvalued in real effective terms. These estimates are, however,
unreliable due to severe data and methodological shortcomings. The staff recommends
maintaining the current level of the nominal exchange rate in the present context, as this
appears to be in line with market forces and consistent with the CBS’ policy of containing
inflation. For the medium term, the mission encourages the authorities to prepare the ground
for allowing a gradual move toward greater exchange rate flexibility. Increased flexibility
would help maintain stability over the medium term, given the prospective depletion of oil
reserves. It would also facilitate a gradual increase in monetary policy independence. This
would have to be preceded by a switch to market-based monetary management and the
development of expertise in foreign exchange operations.
34.
The progress made in transition to a market economy is welcome, but the
remaining structural reform agenda is substantial. Accelerating structural reform is
crucial to minimize the impact of the global slowdown on Syria’s growth prospects,
particularly in view of the need to persevere with fiscal consolidation. In this connection,
staff encourages the authorities to continue to liberalize foreign trade. Staff believe that the
authorities should reconsider the recent decisions requiring importers to open letters of credit
through local banks and to allow the customs department to buy imports at invoice prices. It
is not clear that this is the most effective way to improve accurate invoicing of goods for
customs. Reducing the cost of doing business will also be crucial to further encourage private
investment, promote exports, and create jobs.
35.
Syria continues to maintain exchange restrictions under Article XIV, Section 2
(Appendix I). It also maintains exchange measures subject to approval under Article VIII
(Appendix I). The staff does not recommend approval for their retention. The staff therefore
advises the authorities to eliminate remaining restrictions and multiple currency practices,
and stands ready to conduct a comprehensive review of the exchange system upon the
authorities’ request.
36.
Staff urges the authorities to improve data quality and provision to facilitate
better analysis of developments and guide policy formulation.
37.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard
12-month cycle.

Exchange Rate Arrangement

The Central Bank of Syria issues on a daily basis quotations for the buying and selling
exchange rates for the Syrian pound against major currencies. The official budget exchange
rate, which was applied to all public sector transactions, was pegged to the U.S. dollar until
end-December 2006. Since the abolition of the official “budget” rate on January 1, 2007 and
its unification with the private sector exchange rate, the central bank has been managing the
value of the currency vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar within a tight trading range. The authorities
switched the reference currency from the U.S. dollar to the SDR in August 2007. The de
facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a peg to a basket.

VIII. Article IV Consultations
Syria is on an annual consultation cycle. The last Article IV consultation was held in
April/May 2007 and was completed by the Board on July 31, 2007 (CR/07/288).
IX.

Article XIV and Article VIII Restrictions

Syria continues to maintain, under Article XIV, restrictions on payments and transfers for
current international transactions, including administrative allocation of foreign exchange.
Syria also maintains exchange measures that are subject to Fund approval under Article VIII:
(i) prohibition against purchases by private parties of foreign exchange from the banking
system for some current international transactions; (ii) a multiple currency practice resulting
from divergences of more than 2 percent between the official exchange rate and officially
recognized market exchange rates; (iii) a non-interest-bearing advance import deposit
requirement of 75–100 percent for public sector imports; and (iv) an exchange restriction
arising from the net debt under inoperative bilateral payments arrangements with the Islamic
Republic of Iran, and Sri Lanka.
The Executive Board adopted decision No. 13958 (07/67) at the Board meeting on
July 31, 2007:
38.
The Fund takes this decision relating to the Syrian Arab Republic’s exchange
measures subject to Article VIII, Sections 2(a) and 3, and in concluding the 2006 Article XIV
consultation with the Syrian Arab Republic, in light of the 2006 Article IV consultation with
the Syrian Arab Republic conducted under Decision No. 5392-(77/63), adopted April 29,
1977, as amended (Surveillance over Exchange Rate Policies).
39.
The Syrian Arab Republic maintains restrictions on the making of payments and
transfers for current international transactions in accordance with Article XIV, Section 2, as
described in CR/06/294. In addition, as described in CR/06/294, the Syrian Arab Republic
maintains exchange measures subject to approval under Article VIII. The Fund encourages
the Syrian Arab Republic to eliminate the restrictions maintained under Article XIV, Section
2 as soon as its balance of payments position permits, and to eliminate the measures that are
subject to approval under Article VIII as soon as possible. (CR/07/288).

ANNEX II. SYRIAN ARAB REPUBLIC: RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP9
(End-August 2008)
Syria joined the World Bank in 1947. Between 1963 and 1974, IDA approved four credits for
Syria totaling $48.6 million. Following Syria’s graduation from IDA in 1974, IBRD
approved 15 loans during the period 1974-86. In 1986 Syria ceased debt service payments to
the Bank, which prompted a suspension of Bank disbursements. Following several rounds of
negotiations with the Bank, by July 1, 2002, Syria settled all its overdue service payments to
IBRD and IDA, thereby reinstating the country’s eligibility for disbursement.

There is currently no World Bank Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Syria. A
Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) covering the period 2005-07 provided the framework
for the Bank’s program of advisory and analytical (AAA) services. The MoU allowed the
Bank to support reforms in areas of economic growth and transition, along with human
development and social protection. Activities have included, among others: (i) advise on
restructuring public banks and establishing a government securities market; (ii) FIAS support
provided in reviewing the recently adopted Investment Law; and (iii) analytical work on
energy subsidies and advise on drafting a Basic Finance Law and improving public financial
management.

The Syrian authorities have expressed interest in World Bank Group technical and advisory
services in three areas: (i) economic growth and transition support; (ii) human development
and social protection; and (iii) improving the environment for sustainable development.
Based on preliminary discussions with the Syrian authorities, Bank assistance would take the
form of analytical and advisory services focusing on the following themes:

9

•

Economic Growth and Transition Support. Trade reform; fiscal sustainability; price
liberalization; sources of non-oil growth; private sector development and business
environment.

•

Human Development and Social Protection. Enhancing policymaking and
implementation capacity in social protection; support to avian influenza preparedness;
reform options for social insurance; and education sector strategy.

World Bank TA mission focusing on trade, fiscal issues, and the development of a SAM for Syria will overlap
with the 2008 Article IV Consultation mission, facilitating Bank-Fund coordination.

6
•

Sustainable Development. Electricity sector strategy; agriculture sector reform; solid
waste technical assistance; water and wastewater technical assistance; and transport
sector technical assistance.

IFC has been active in Syria since 1999 when the Board approved the corporation’s first
investment in the country—a $1 million equity stake in a manufacturer of drip irrigation
systems. Since that time, IFC has made two other investments, including an equity position
in the first private sector bank in Syria and a loan to a chemicals company. The total held
portfolio is $20 million. IFC has also conducted technical assistance work, including studies
of aspects of the financial sector.

7
ANNEX III. SYRIAN ARAB REPUBLIC: STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
Data provision has serious shortcomings that significantly hamper surveillance. The
weak statistical infrastructure has been unable to cope with the acceleration of structural
reforms, and the inherent difficulties in recording the flows of people, goods, and money to and
from Iraq have added to this challenge. The staff’s assessment of economic developments and
policies is constrained by these circumstances. In the context of Article IV missions, the
authorities have expressed an intention to improve the statistical system. With the assistance of
the 2007 multisector statistics mission, Syria began participating in the General Data
Dissemination System (GDDS) in December 2007, and the plans for improving the statistical
system are posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board.
A. Real Sector Statistics
2.
Annual national accounts by expenditure data are reported for publication in the
International Financial Statistics (IFS) with about 2-years lag. In addition, significant
weaknesses remain in the source data and statistical techniques for national accounts statistics.
3.
A STA-resident statistics advisor has been in place since July 2008 to help implement
the recommendations of the December 2007 STA multisector mission in the area of national
accounts. During the past two years, METAC has also provided technical assistance for
improving data sources and methods for the compilation of national accounts statistics in
accordance with the System of National Accounts, 1993 (1993 SNA). Guidance has also being
provided for using existing data for improving gross domestic product (GDP) estimates at
current and constant prices and for the appropriate treatment in the national accounts of implicit
subsidies to some public enterprises. The Central Bureau of Statistics (CBStat) made a steady
progress for implementing recommendations made by the technical assistance missions.
Economic surveys covering private sector enterprises had been conducted for years 2004–06.
The central purpose of these surveys was to serve as main data source for improving national
accounts statistics in accordance with the 1993 SNA; however, the results are yet to be fully
processed and validated.

8
B. Government Finance Statistics
4.
Government finance statistics (GFS) suffer from major deficiencies with respect
to definitions, coverage, classification, methodology, accuracy, reliability, and timeliness
that generate severe inconsistencies with monetary and balance of payments statistics. Fiscal
statistics are not provided for publication in the IFS. The multisector mission of June 2004
found that compilation is adversely affected by cumbersome institutional arrangements,
inadequate resources, and unresolved methodological problems. The methodology used for
compilation does not follow either GFSM 2001 or GFSM 1986. While budget data are available
with very long lags (two years for final budget accounts), financing data are not available. There
is no dissemination of GFS data, and even access to key data sources by GFS compilers within
the Ministry of Finance (MOF), such as the breakdown of debt service into interest and
amortization, is problematic. This contributes to discrepancies in external financing as reported
in the budget and the balance of payments statistics.
5.
The largest, most persistent and volatile discrepancies, are between the financing
requirements of the budget, as reported by the MOF, and government financing as reported by
the Central Bank of Syria (CBS). The lack of a common and regularly updated coverage of the
government sector between the MOF and the CBS, misclassification of public enterprises
investment expenditure, as well as timing and valuation issues, are mainly responsible for those
discrepancies.
6.
Other discrepancies between fiscal and monetary accounts relate to the unorthodox
treatment by the CBS of some transactions with government, such as the parallel rise of
government deposits and claims on government in the CBS balance sheet, which is likely due to
government withdrawals being counted as credit and never netted out against deposits, and
profits transferred to government treated as permanent claim on the government.
7.
To address the methodological issues, the June 2004 multisector mission developed a
preliminary bridge table that maps the budgetary source data codes to the GFSM 2001
classification codes, and conducted a seminar to clarify various aspects of the GFSM 2001
methodology to the MOF officials. To help the Directorate of Planning and Statistics (DPS)
implement a proper sectorization scheme, the mission provided an updated institutional table
showing the current coverage of government and public enterprises―the investment
expenditure of public enterprises is included in government’s capital expenditure―for
circulation to all relevant agencies. Moreover, the mission formulated a detailed work plan
centered around the provision of adequate resources and training for the DPS to fulfill its tasks.
The work plan calls for the DPS to access core source data necessary for compilation―initially
on a cash basis―of annual GFS data according to the GFSM 2001, and for the resumption
of data reporting to STA for publication in GFSY and IFS, together with improved reporting, in
terms of coverage and classification, to the IMF’s Middle East and Central Asia Department
(MCD). The mission also recommended improvement in the timeliness of annual data,
including data on financing, and a start on the compilation of sub-annual data.

9
C. Monetary and Financial Statistics
8.
Monetary statistics suffer from major deficiencies which hamper the staff’s ability to
conduct meaningful analysis of monetary developments. Monthly monetary statistics are
reported for publication in the IFS with about 10-month lags, falling short of recommended
dissemination practices under the GDDS of 3-month lags. Progress has been made in addressing
some issues identified by the multisector statistics mission in June 2004, namely including in the
monetary survey the private banks, the Savings Bank, and banks/bank branches operating in the
Free Zones. Although the format of monetary statistics is largely consistent with the structure of
the MFSM-recommended sectoral surveys, there are deficiencies in the source data arising from,
inter alia, (i) the use of different exchange rates at the CBS and at the other banks for valuing
their foreign-currency positions; (ii) financial positions are not valued at market prices or
market-price equivalents; (iii) a number of accounting procedures for the maintenance of public
sector accounts cause distortions in the measurement of gross positions; and (iv) there are
disparities between the institutional coverage of public sector in monetary statistics and the
government finance statistics.
9.
A technical assistance mission during November–December 2008 worked with the
authorities on developing data reporting based on the Standardized Report Forms (SRFs), which
reflect the MFSM-recommended compilation principles. The mission’s work was underpinned
by detailed data recently provided by the authorities.
D. External Sector Statistics
10.
Balance of payments statistics are compiled by the CBS on a provisional basis. Trade
data are compiled monthly by the Customs Department and reported quarterly by the CBStat in
local currency units with a six-month lag. The BOP is presented in BPM5 format, but its
compilation method is not entirely consistent with the BPM5 methodology.
11.
In February 2006, a STA assessment mission assessed the status of the work program as
a basis for developing a METAC technical assistance program on external sector statistics. In
December 2007, STA conducted a multisector statistics mission in collaboration with METAC
and follow-up METAC missions took place in January and July 2008.
12.
In September 2008, a STA inspection visit followed up on the recommendations of the
2007 multisector mission and METAC’s work program and discussed the reporting and
publication of data on international liquidity for IFS, which has been an outstanding issue for
over three years.
13.
Regarding the balance of payments, the mission found that the CBS had made progress
in improving source statistics through surveys and International Transactions Reporting System
(ITRS), by adopting appropriate classifications, and improving consistency with other data sets.
The CBS’s new organizational structure is designed to include a balance of payments division

10
of five staff (currently two staff are assigned to BOP work but plans are in place to fully staff
the division).
14.
The October 2008 STA balance of payments statistics mission worked to provide advice
on international reserves, trade data, and the treatment of Iraqi immigrants was provided, to the
extent possible. Data for 2007 were adjusted where needed and the mission assisted the CBS
staff to compile January-July 2008 balance of payments in BPM5 format.
15.
Despite recent progress, further efforts are needed to improve the accuracy of the BOP
data to meet data needs for surveillance purposes, in particular; (i) continue data collection
initiatives (ITRS and surveys) that have been developed with a view to strengthening source
data, and ensuring coverage of free zones, (ii) improve the undercoverage of imports,
(iii) examine the scope of transfers, including the treatment of inflows related to Iraqi
immigrants, (iv) review the coverage of reserves , and (iv) improve the coverage of financial
account data of the private sector (bank and nonbank).
16.
The authorities have made some progress in the compilation of international
merchandise trade statistics. The Customs Department has adopted Automated System for
Customs Data (ASYCUDA) as its operating system and is presently implementing it and a
Statistical Committee on Foreign Trade Statistics has been formed to assist with trade
methodology. However, significant weaknesses remain in the source data and statistical
techniques for foreign trade statistics.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
January 9, 2009

1.
The following information has become available since the staff report was issued. It
does not change the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
On December 1, 2008, the authorities increased the domestic price of fuel oil by
46 percent, which is a larger increase than the initially anticipated 33 percent. The additional
revenue from this larger increase is equivalent to about 0.85 percent of GDP. The lower
WEO oil price projection of January 6, 2009 would also have a positive impact on the fiscal
deficit equivalent to about 0.25 percent of GDP due to the smaller cost of the negative
external net oil balance.
3.
Additional information on the 2009 budget law has also become available. Staff has
not had a chance to discuss the details with the authorities. However, in view of the new
aggregate information, staff has revised the projections for wage and development
expenditures upwards by about 0.7 and 0.6 percent of GDP, respectively.
4.
Taking into account the net impact of the above factors, the revised fiscal deficit
projection for 2009 would be about 3.3 percent of GDP, slightly above the initial projection
of 3.1 percent. This revision does not change staff’s assessment, but further highlights the
need to restrain expenditure and further advance other fiscal reform efforts, particularly those
aimed at fully eliminating oil subsidies and introducing the value added tax by 2010.

Public Information Notice (PIN) No. 09/07
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
January, 26, 2009

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2008 Article IV Consultation with
the Syrian Arab Republic
On January 9, 2009, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with the Syrian Arab Republic.1
Background
Syria’s overall macroeconomic performance has been strong. Non-oil real GDP is
estimated to have been about 6 percent in 2007, despite unfavorable weather conditions
affecting agriculture. Virtually all other non-oil sectors continued to grow strongly. Oil
output, however, remained on a downward trend. As a result, overall growth registered
only about 4 percent. Preliminary data for 2008 indicate a rate of non-oil growth similar
to 2007, despite a further decline in agricultural output, as construction and services
maintained their rapid expansion. Overall growth is expected to be about 5 percent in
2008. Inflation accelerated to 17-20 percent by mid-2008, up from a reported 5 percent
in 2007. However, it started to decline in the fourth quarter of 2008 in line with
international food prices, and is projected to average about 15 percent for the year.
While the overall fiscal deficit increased to about 3.5 percent of GDP in 2007, the non-oil
deficit improved slightly. Oil revenue decreased by about 2 percent of GDP. Non-oil
receipts also declined, partly reflecting the reduction in customs tariffs. Current and
capital outlays were reduced by about 1 percent of GDP in total.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return
to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive
Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board,
summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's
authorities.

2
The fiscal deficit is expected to stabilize in 2008, mainly as a result of the reduction in
fuel subsidies. The authorities launched a program to phase out these subsidies in May
2008 by increasing the prices of gasoline and diesel. These price increases and an
overall expenditure restraint led to a further small narrowing of the non-oil deficit, despite
the continued decline in customs revenue resulting from the full year effect of the 2007
reduction in tariffs.
The external current account deficit is expected to widen to about 4 percent of GDP in
2008, from 3.3 percent in 2007. The net oil balance (after subtracting the share of
foreign partners) turned negative due to declining output and rising domestic
consumption. However, non-oil exports, tourism, and remittances grew rapidly as a
result of strong regional demand and the relaxation of foreign exchange controls. Net
official foreign assets have been stable at about $17 billion (10 months of imports). The
real effective exchange rate of the Syrian pound appreciated by 4 percent in 2007, and
about 9 percent in the first three quarters of 2008 due to the combined effect of rising
inflation and the pound’s nominal appreciation against the dollar.
Broad money has been growing in line with nominal GDP. This growth mainly reflected
domestic credit expansion. Credit to public enterprises grew by about 40 percent in
2007 and by 60 percent in the first half of 2008 (y-o-y), reflecting the rising financing
needs of enterprises providing fuel and other subsidies. Growth of credit to the private
sector was about 20 percent in 2007 and is expected to register 25 percent in 2008.
Interest rates remained low, and became largely negative in real terms with the rise in
inflation in 2008.
The impact of adverse global and regional developments currently underway on the
Syrian economy are expected to be relatively mild in the short term. The effects are
likely to be through weakening FDI, remittances, and demand for Syrian exports from
the Gulf region. The medium-term outlook is then expected to improve as the global and
regional economies begin to recover. The fiscal and current account deficits are
expected to stabilize as a result of the fiscal reforms currently in the pipeline and a
resumption in the strong growth of exports of goods and services. This generally
positive outlook is contingent on perseverance in advancing fiscal and structural reforms
and a gradual global recovery over the next two years.
Significant progress has been made on the structural front over the last two years, but
the reform agenda remains substantial. Important progress toward exchange rate
unification has been achieved; a dynamic private banking sector is growing; the
investment regime is being liberalized; and trade liberalization has also continued.

Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed Syria’s strong macroeconomic performance in recent
years, as manifested in the rapid non-oil GDP growth, comfortable level of foreign
reserves, and low and declining government debt. This performance reflected both
robust regional demand and the authorities’ reform efforts to shift toward a more marketbased economy.
At the same time, Directors observed that oil production and exports are declining, and
Syria has already become a net oil importer. Inflation has declined in recent months as a
result of falling international food and fuel prices, but remains high. Directors also noted
the downside risks to growth arising from the current adverse global and regional
developments—although many Directors considered these risks to be relatively mild
because of Syria’s still limited integration into the international financial system and the
significant potential for raising foreign direct investment and tourism exports. Directors
were encouraged by the authorities’ efforts to address these challenges, and urged
steadfast implementation of fiscal and structural reforms to support economic growth
and diversification.
Directors encouraged the authorities to continue to reduce the non-oil fiscal deficit
through mobilization of non-oil revenue, restraint on current expenditure—notably wages
and subsidies—and prioritization of investment projects. They underscored the
importance of the authorities’ adherence to plans to introduce the value added tax by
the new target date of 2010, and supported the adoption of a single rate with limited
exemptions. They commended the steps taken to reduce fuel subsidies, and
encouraged the authorities to eliminate such subsidies by 2010 as planned—while
developing a well-targeted compensation scheme to mitigate the impact on the poor.
Directors emphasized the importance of strengthening public expenditure management,
including by reforming the budget process, improving the monitoring of expenditures at
the regional level, establishing a single treasury account, and reducing extra-budgetary
and quasi-fiscal operations through the banking system and bringing them on budget.
They welcomed the authorities’ intention to issue treasury bills in 2009, observing that
this will also help develop the domestic capital market and strengthen the conduct of
monetary policy.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to maintain a cautious monetary policy
stance. They urged the authorities to strictly limit directed lending by public banks,
develop indirect monetary policy instruments, further liberalize interest rates, and
modernize the role and responsibilities of the central bank.
Directors welcomed the 2008 FSAP finding that banks are well-capitalized and liquid,
while noting the vulnerabilities in state-owned banks. They noted that enhancing the
availability of reliable financial sector indicators would facilitate a more precise
assessment and monitoring of the banking sector. They commended the authorities’

4
quick response to the FSAP recommendations, and encouraged them to continue their
efforts in this regard. Directors stressed that bank supervision should be strengthened,
and that all banks should be subject to annual independent audits and should provide
timely information to the central bank. They urged the authorities to give priority to
restructuring and commercializing the operations of state-owned banks. Directors noted
the authority’s efforts to enhance the framework for combating money laundering and
terrorism financing, and encouraged further work in this area.
Directors agreed that the Syrian pound’s peg to the SDR remains appropriate, as it
provides a strong monetary anchor while allowing some flexibility in the pound’s rate
vis-à-vis major currencies. While acknowledging available estimates of the real effective
exchange rate that show moderate over-valuation, Directors noted that these estimates
are not reliable. Accordingly, Directors did not recommend any change in the exchange
rate level in the present context. Directors encouraged the authorities to prepare the
ground for a gradual move toward greater exchange rate flexibility over the medium
term. They called on the authorities to remove the existing exchange restrictions and
multiple currency practice.
Directors emphasized that vigorous implementation of the authorities’ substantial
structural reform agenda will be crucial to accelerate the shift to a more market-oriented
and non-oil-based economy. They commended the reduction in import duties, and
encouraged the authorities to continue to liberalize foreign trade and to improve the
business environment.
Directors underscored that shortcomings in Syria’s economic and financial statistics
continue to hamper effective Fund surveillance and national policy formulation. They
urged the authorities to improve the quality and timeliness of economic data.

Statement by A. Shakour Shaalan, Executive Director for Syrian Arab Republic
January 9, 2009
1.
The Syrian economy has enjoyed buoyant growth since it embarked on a
liberalization program aimed at unleashing the economy’s growth potential and integrating
into the world economy. Non-oil growth has averaged 7 percent from 2004-2008, and is
expected to pick up after a temporary slowdown in 2009. The Syrian authorities are firmly
committed to their reform program that aims to lay the foundation for sustainable higher
growth. Their 5-year development plan (2006-2010) targets medium-term growth of 7
percent from 2010 as the economy’s productive capacity is unleashed. The plan aims at
maintaining macroeconomic stability, continued deregulation, and furthering global
integration to attract private investment, as well as a wide range of structural reforms to
ensure good economic governance and growth with equity.
Near-term outlook and impact of global turmoil
2.
The economy has been relatively sheltered from the global financial turmoil partly
owing to strict regulations on banks’ foreign exposures. Nevertheless, growth is expected to
moderate somewhat in the period immediately ahead as the global and regional slowdown
may temper the growth rate of non-oil exports and remittance receipts. However, the
potential adverse impact is limited because these flows have been growing at a modest rate
from a low base and hence are less likely to face declining demand than had they grown in
line with the rise in oil prices. Moreover, there is considerable scope for growth in FDI and
tourism receipts, both of which are at low levels relative to Syria’s comparative cost
advantage. Declining oil import prices will also assist in strengthening the external position.
3.
Oil has been an important contributor to growth, fiscal revenue, and foreign exchange
receipts. At its peak in 2001-2004, oil contributed to over 70 percent of exports and about 50
percent of fiscal revenue. However, current oil production has fallen short of domestic needs
on account of rapidly growing domestic consumption demand, turning Syria back into a net
oil importer in 2007. Without any further discoveries, production levels would gradually
decline and reserves would be depleted by 2030. Although exploration activity has recently
picked up with ongoing bidding on additional blocks that could lead to future discoveries, the
authorities’ plans are based on building the economic foundations for non-oil sustainable
growth.
Fiscal policy and reforms
4.
Fiscal outcomes have out-performed earlier expectations with the overall fiscal deficit
in 2006 and 2007, at 1.2 and 3.3 percent of GDP, respectively. More notably, the balance
excluding oil revenue has improved by 7 percentage points of GDP between 2004 and 2007.
This favorable outcome was achieved through underspending of both the current and capital
outlays despite budgetary pressures stemming from the large number of Iraqi refugees.
Meanwhile, non-oil revenue collections had been strengthened primarily through increased

2
indirect taxes and public enterprise surpluses, which helped offset the impact of tariff
liberalization. Based on preliminary indications, the overall fiscal out-turn will remain stable
in 2008 and current expenditures will decline further as a share of GDP. Significant fuel price
adjustments in May 2008 helped curtail fuel subsidies and reduced fuel imports. While these
necessitated a 25 percent public sector wage increases to compensate for rising fuel prices
and help retain its skilled civil service, the public wage bill has been kept under control and is
declining as a share of GDP. Public debt is low and has fallen further to 22 percent of GDP
by end-2008.
5.
Fiscal policy remains constrained in 2009 to consolidate recent gains. The new
budget extends the authorities’ efforts to prepare for the decline in oil revenue, and as such, it
is expected to deliver an additional 1 percentage point reduction in the non-oil fiscal balance
by constraining current and capital outlays. They are considering targeted cash transfers and
further fuel price adjustments, if needed, consistent with their plan to eliminate subsidies by
2010. The authorities view the VAT as a key source of revenue to offset dwindling oil
revenues and are keen to ensure that the necessary preconditions are in place for its
successful launch, including improved billing practices. Reform of customs administration is
proceeding under an EU project while The Fund’s METAC is helping to modernize budget
processes including through the introduction of a medium-term expenditure framework. The
ongoing implementation of an integrated information technology system is an important step
toward improved expenditure management through a single treasury account.
Monetary and exchange rate policies
6.
Monetary policy has been cautious and the Central Bank of Syria (CBS) has actively
pursued institutional and monetary system reforms. Important progress has been achieved in
the two key reform priorities, namely developing market-based monetary management
instruments and strengthening banking sector regulation and supervision. Treasury bills were
issued in two successful pilot auctions in July 2008 and regular Treasury bill auctions are set
to be launched in 2009. At the same time, the CBS is considering issuance of its own
certificates of deposits to mop up excess liquidity should Treasury bill auctions be delayed.
Discussions have commenced on the transfer of state foreign exchange assets held by the
Commercial Bank of Syria to the CBS and this process is due to be completed in 2009. A
liquidity framework is being developed and the central bank is undertaking reforms to
modernize its operations, expand its research capacity, and strengthen financial sector risk
management.
7.
The authorities view favorably their experience with the peg to the SDR which has
served as a credible monetary anchor. Strong export growth and buoyant international
reserves attest to the maintenance of competitiveness and reaffirm the appropriateness of the
current regime. Liberalization of foreign exchange trading has solidified market confidence
and brought about exchange rate stability, which in turn has helped curb inflationary
pressures.

3
The banking sector
8.
The banking system is well capitalized and well provisioned and banking supervision
is being strengthened to improve resilience to shocks. Private banks have been licensed since
2004 and their share of total banking assets is nearly 20 percent. The authorities welcomed
the assessment and recommendations provided by the FSAP team and have moved swiftly to
adopt many of its recommendations. In particular, state banks are improving their reporting
and preparing restructuring plans that outline their reform priorities. Off-site and on-site
supervision have been strengthened and the entry of private and foreign banks has increased
incentives to improve state banks’ cost control and profitability.
9.
The Syrian authorities value the analysis and advice of the Fund and appreciate the
constructive spirit of the discussions. On their behalf, I wish to thank the staff team for their
well-appreciated work.
