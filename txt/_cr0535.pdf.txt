enhancing incentives to work, reducing the taxation of labor, and pursuing further
pension reform. In the absence of a wide-ranging set of structural reforms to raise
employment and potential growth, Directors considered that a large fiscal surplus
would be necessary to safeguard long-term fiscal sustainability.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background and Outlook: The economy weathered the global slowdown relatively well.
Stimulated by an expansionary fiscal policy, domestic demand propelled growth well above
the euro area average. With strengthening global activity, growth is expected to pick up to
about 3 percent in 2004–05, with a closing of the small output gap. Employment has
stagnated, however, and unemployment remains stuck at about 9 percent since 2001.
Inflation fell to the lowest level in the euro area in 2004, reflecting large cuts in indirect
taxation, but is expected to gradually revert to close to the euro area average. The recently
concluded 2½ year wage accord is moderate, accompanied by sizable (about 1 percent of
GDP) cuts in income taxation over 2005–07. While the fiscal surplus at about 2 percent of
GDP appears comfortable in a comparative EU context, it is inadequate since the longer-term
fiscal outlook is clouded by rapid population aging which sets in earlier than any other
EU country.
Policy discussions centered on the following key issues:
●

The stance of short-term fiscal policy in light of the need to cut labor taxes to
boost employment prospects, and the coming aging-related fiscal pressures.
Although no longer necessary from a cyclical perspective, the authorities viewed the
income tax cuts as appropriate in the context of a moderate wage agreement and to
achieve a critically needed increase in employment. The staff argued that the planned
tax cuts should be offset by cuts in spending in order not to add to the long-term
burden of fiscal adjustment.

●

The staff and the authorities concurred on the benefits from mutually reinforcing
labor and product market reforms that would obviate the need for larger fiscal
adjustment over the long-term. In addition to the pension reforms currently being
implemented, the mission urged the adoption of measures to enhance employment
at both ends of the age spectrum, address labor market mismatches, and increase
job search incentives. Productivity gains, relatively low outside the high technology
sector, could be boosted through strengthened competition, especially in sheltered
sectors, and through a smaller role for the state.

●

The imminent aging of the population would lead to rising expenditure pressures.
With a view to further reducing the still high levels of labor taxation, focus needs
to be placed on expenditure restraint. This would require, inter alia, raising efficiency
in the delivery of social services, especially at the local level. The mission noted that
while the recent pension reform is an important step in the right direction, it is, in
itself, insufficient to ensure sustainability of the system. In view of the worsening
electoral arithmetic as the median age of the average voter rises rapidly, the mission
called for early consideration of further measures.

I. ECONOMIC BACKGROUND
1.
The Finnish economy has made impressive strides in recent years, but faces
earlier than any other country in the EU the challenge of population aging. Sustained
economic growth over the past decade, among the highest in the industrialized world, has
been underpinned by productivity gains led by the high technology electronics sector. A
stable macroeconomic policy framework with low inflation and sizeable fiscal surpluses has
supported investor confidence. However, employment has been stagnant since 2002 and
unemployment has remained stubbornly high. The longer-term outlook is clouded by
imminent aging of the population, with old-age dependency set to rise most rapidly among
EU countries.
2.
Recent Fund advice has underlined the need for sizeable fiscal surpluses and
further structural reforms to address the aging shock. The authorities broadly share the
Fund’s assessment that large fiscal surpluses are needed over the coming decade and
beyond to cope with the expected long-term fiscal pressures and ensure sustainability. The
goals of the pension reforms recently initiated by the authorities are in line with Fund advice,
although the authorities do not envisage further measures in the near future. The authorities
share the Fund view that greater labor market flexibility and a shift to a more decentralized
wage-setting system are desirable, but they regard these as medium-term goals that can only
be achieved gradually, in view of the long tradition of solidaristic wage bargaining.
3.
The economy weathered the global slowdown relatively well. The robust pace of
domestic demand, stimulated by an expansionary fiscal policy, helped sustain GDP growth at
2 percent in 2003, well above the euro area average of ½ percent (Table 1). Domestic
demand, especially private consumption, has continued to drive growth in 2004 as well, as
disposable income was further boosted by exceptionally low inflation and sizeable tax cuts
(Figure 1). While housing

The cyclical recovery has failed to revive the labor market in the face of
persistent structural rigidities. The unemployment rate has remained at 9 percent since
2000, slightly above the estimated NAIRU of about 8½ percent (Figure 2).1 A centralized
wage-setting regime has fostered wage compression and led to growing mismatch in the
labor market. At the same time, high

5.
Inflation has fallen to the lowest level in the euro area. The HICP measure of
inflation declined to 1.3 percent in 2003 and fell even further in 2004, reflecting large cuts in
indirect taxation, especially on alcohol and cars, low import prices, the weak labor market
and growing competition in services such as retailing, telecom, and air transport. As the
impact of one-off factors such as the tax cuts recedes, inflation is gradually expected to revert
close to the average prevailing in the euro area. The pace of house price inflation rose to
8 percent in 2003 from the recent annual average of 5 percent, mainly reflecting the rising
cost of building land, especially in the Helsinki region.
6.
Strong productivity gains have helped contain unit labor costs despite a faster
rise in wages than the EU average. Recent high productivity growth has, however, been
concentrated in a few sectors such as the Nokia-led electronics sector and financial services,
without significant diffusion across the rest of the economy. The lack of large spillover
effects may reflect the relative inflexibility of labor and product markets (Box 1).

unemployment, including participants in active labor market programs and those under

Box 1. Finland—How Durable Is the Nokia Effect?
The emergence of the high-technology sector led by Nokia has played a key role in altering
the structure of the Finnish economy over the past decade. The industrial structure and the
profile of exports, traditionally

downturn in the ICT industry.
Source: OECD STAN Indicators Database
The acceleration in productivity growth since the mid-1990s primarily reflects the
productivity gains in the ICT sector, without significant diffusion across the rest of the
economy. Nokia accounts for almost half of the Finnish ICT cluster’s sales and its network
includes a large number of suppliers and subcontractors (Paija, 2001).1 However, productivity
gains outside the Nokia cluster have been relatively small and temporary.2 With weak interindustry linkages between the Nokia cluster and the rest of the economy, the ICT diffusion and
spillover effects in the form of research and development (R&D) and knowledge sharing appear to
have been small, unlike in the United States and to a lesser extent in Sweden.
The relative inflexibility of the labor and product markets may have prevented stronger
diffusion of productivity gains throughout the economy. A tentative conclusion from the
Finnish experience seems to be that ICT diffusion can lead to economy-wide productivity gains
only if accompanied by flexible labor and product markets. The period of Nokia’s rise coincided
with the global ICT sector boom and liberalization of telecom equipment and service markets. In
the past two years, the global ICT downturn and increasingly stiffer competition have already had
an adverse impact on Nokia’s prospects. While Nokia’s impact on Finland’s exports, growth, and
R&D spending continues to be substantial, steps to enhance the economy’s competitiveness
through deeper structural reforms would seem imperative to meet the coming challenges from
globalization and demography.

7.
The wage accord concluded in December 2004 represents a continuation of
efforts to ensure wage moderation in return for cuts in income taxation. The accord, to
be ratified in union-level negotiations, covers a period of two and a half years to September
2007, and, including local-level increases and wage drift, is expected to result in a rise in
annual wages of about 3½ percent over this period, broadly in line with recent years. In the
context of the agreement, the government announced its intention to reduce income taxes by
over 1 percent of GDP over the 2005–07 period. The accord retains the essentially
centralized framework of Finland’s wage bargaining regime, in contrast to the recent Nordic
trend towards firm-level bargaining.
8.
The large current account surpluses partly reflect low domestic investment.
Finland has recorded surpluses in the range of 5 to 8 percent of GDP since the mid-1990s and
is expected to sustain similar surpluses over the medium-term (Table 3). While in the late
1990s, they flowed partly from the thriving exports, more recently, they are largely a
counterpart of the low level of corporate investment and higher net factor incomes. Finland’s
investment ratio has been below the euro area average for the past ten years. The net
international investment position (excluding equities) has turned positive.
9.
The fiscal surplus has rapidly eroded in recent years. Although the general
government surplus, at around 2 percent of GDP in 2003, remained among the highest in the
advanced world, it was more than

however, it is also a consequence
of a sharp discretionary policy shift as the structural surplus fell by 3¼ percent of GDP over
the period (Figure 3). The strong fiscal expansion—second only to that observed in the
United States and the United Kingdom in the OECD area—was largely brought about by
increased public spending in 2002 and tax cuts in 2003, the latter amounting to about
1½ percent of GDP.
10.
Strong growth helped maintain the fiscal surplus at 2 percent of GDP in 2004,
although the structural balance weakened further. With growth about ½ percent above
that estimated in the budget, revenues were buoyant, despite cuts in income taxes and alcohol
excises, totaling some 1 percent of GDP. The revised four-year expenditure rule with a
1-year legal and a 3-year indicative ceiling—covering about three-fourths of central
government spending, but excluding cyclical, interest, and other volatile expenditures—was
observed, although the margin remaining over the 2005–08 horizon is limited. The structural
surplus is estimated to have worsened by about ½ percent of GDP.

The budget for 2005 is expansionary despite the projected economic rebound. A
cut in the corporate tax rate of 3 percentage points (to 26 percent) and in the personal capital
income tax rate by 1 percentage point (to 28 percent) is designed to stimulate investment. In
the context of the incomes policy accord, the authorities have also announced cuts in income
taxes of 0.2 percent of GDP, aimed at stimulating employment. The general government
surplus is projected to decline to about 1¾ percent of GDP, with the deficit of the central and
local government sector likely to exceed ¾ percent of GDP.

A significant reform of the public pension system is underway. The reform, to be
phased in over an extended period beginning 2005, aims to raise the effective retirement age,
currently 59 years. A key element of the reform is the replacement of the standard retirement
age of 65 with a flexible retirement age ranging from 62 to 68, and an accrual rate rising with
age for older workers. The inactivity rates in Finland among males aged 50 and over from
sickness and disability are among the highest in the industrialized world.
II. THE POLICY SETTING AND THE OUTLOOK
14.
The longer-term outlook is clouded by rapid population aging and the
economy’s vulnerability to shocks due to its relatively undiversified structure. The
lackluster productivity record of the sheltered sectors is likely to hold back growth as the
contribution from the high technology sector, facing falling prices and stiffer competition in
world markets, becomes less significant. The challenge for policy is to raise the utilization of
labor in the face of low participation rates at both ends of the age spectrum. Labor resources
are set to decline even more rapidly than in other European economies, constraining the
fiscal room for maneuver. Indeed, the changing population age structure will begin to impact
the labor market as early as 2006. The economy’s greater vulnerability to shocks in light of
its specialization in telecom and forestry products also argues for reforms to raise the
flexibility of product and labor markets (Box 1).

- 13 -

15.
Despite Finland’s top position in competitiveness rankings, there is fairly
widespread anxiety about the economy’s ability to compete in a rapidly globalizing
world. The unease stems from a perception that “a small, expensive, rapidly aging and
remote country”2 would be unattractive to global investors. A variety of trends—Finnish
companies’ rising propensity to invest abroad; shrinking net capital stock as the investment
ratio remains below that of the euro area; the secular decline in the terms of trade as export
prices fall; and persistence of high structural unemployment—all tend to feed a climate of
pessimism about the economy’s long-term prospects. The authorities have been trying to
raise public awareness of the coming demographic transition and of the need to persevere
with structural reforms if Finland is to capitalize on its strengths: a highly educated labor
force, a culture of innovation, a consensual social climate, and strong macroeconomic
fundamentals.3
16.
In the near-term, an improved domestic and external climate is set to strengthen
growth. Domestic demand is projected to accelerate to 2½ percent in 2004, as tax cuts
stimulate consumption and investment stages a tentative recovery. Although monetary
conditions have tightened, reflecting the euro appreciation, they are not expected to hold
back the recovery of demand (Figure 4). Staff’s forecast, based on assumptions underlying
the ongoing WEO exercise, is for GDP to grow by around 3 percent in both 2004 and 2005
and for the small output gap to close. However, unemployment is expected to decline only
slightly. The latest official projections, assuming an oil price of about US$45 in 2005 and
US$40 in 2006, and an average euro exchange rate of $1.24, are broadly similar.
17.
The risks to the forecast are evenly balanced. A faster pace of global recovery than
assumed and a turnaround in Nokia’s market share could strengthen exports further. The
present projection assumes a continued loss in Finland’s overall market share. Measures of
competitiveness have remained broadly stable over the past two years despite the
appreciation of the euro. However, high oil prices and further appreciation of the euro could
worsen prospects in the euro area as a whole, while continued adverse employment trends
could damage consumer confidence.

III. THE POLICY DISCUSSIONS
18.
Against the backdrop of a nascent recovery and the demographic transition, the
discussions centered on three key issues.
•

Ensuring fiscal sustainability: With a recovery underway and rapidly approaching
demographic pressures, how to place the fiscal position on a stronger footing through
additional pension reforms and expenditure restraint, which would also allow for
further reductions in the high taxation of labor;

•

Enhancing employment at both ends of the age spectrum: How to calibrate
policies to boost employment among the young and older workers, address labor
market mismatches by reducing wage compression, boosting the demand for
unskilled labor, and increasing incentives for job search;

•

Broadening productivity gains: Strengthening competition, especially in sheltered
sectors (utilities, transport and retail services, and agriculture), and reducing public
ownership.
A. Fiscal Policy Issues

19.
The medium-term fiscal prospects are shaped by the strengthening recovery and
the planned tax cuts. The authorities noted that following the strong stimulus of 2001–03,
fiscal policy had returned closer to a neutral stance in 2004. The stimulus implied in the
budget for 2005, although no longer needed from a cyclical perspective, was considered
appropriate since it flowed largely from the authorities’ commitment to tax cuts in the
context of the centralized wage accord and the critical importance of the objective of raising
employment. Officials shared the mission’s concern over the composition of the public sector
surplus, with the central government balance expected to move into a sizeable deficit in
2005. The authorities were candid in acknowledging the difficulties in meeting the official
objective of a balance in central government finances by 2007, but they remained committed
to achieving it. The medium-term fiscal outlook is not regarded as a cause for concern,
although longer-term prospects are less reassuring (Table 4).
20.
The authorities and the staff concur that mutually reinforcing labor and product
market reforms would obviate the need for larger fiscal adjustment over the long-term
(Box 2). Absent such reforms, assessments of fiscal sustainability, employing broadly similar
frameworks—those by the staff, the authorities, and the OECD—conclude that, despite
starting from a net asset position, sizeable fiscal surpluses will be needed over the coming
decade. The staff analysis suggests that, on present policies, the general government
(excluding the social security surpluses of about 2½ percent of GDP) would need to sustain
annual surpluses of 1½ percent of GDP through the end of the decade to ensure
sustainability, compared with a present deficit of about ¾ percent of GDP. A more ambitious
set of structural reforms, spanning the fiscal and pension fronts as well as labor and product

Box 2. Structural Reforms and Fiscal Sustainability
The long-term fiscal outlook is less
comfortable than it appears at
first glance. With the impact of
aging occurring about a decade
earlier than in many other European
countries—between 2010 and 2025,
the rise in the old-age dependency
ratio is the steepest in the EU—and
the stronger response of age-related
spending, reflecting Finland’s
comprehensive public welfare
provision, leaves it little fiscal
leeway.

Staff analysis suggests that, in the absence of further structural reforms, sizeable fiscal
surpluses would be required over the coming decade to meet the demographic shock.
Staff’s baseline projections suggest that, on present policies, a permanent fiscal adjustment of
about 2 percent of GDP is required to ensure sustainability (Figure 5).1 The conclusion of this
scenario mirrors that of the authorities’ own assessment, which suggests that the currently
envisaged general government surpluses of about 2 percent of GDP for the rest of the decade
will eventually result in accelerating public debt, as the fiscal costs of aging materialize. In the
same vein, a recent OECD study suggests that—assuming no further pension reforms, potential
output growth of 2¼ percent and even some increase in employment—a permanent fiscal
adjustment of 1 percent of GDP would be needed to avoid a sharp deterioration of the
government net asset position by 2050.2 A significant fiscal tightening would be needed under
the authorities’ present program to achieve the required adjustment.
A more ambitious set of structural reforms would reduce the need for large fiscal
surpluses, creating room for tax cuts. Staff’s analysis on the basis of the Fund’s GEM model,
calibrated to the Finnish economy, shows that a combination of product and labor market
reforms would help initiate a virtuous circle that would substantially reduce the required fiscal
adjustment. In the “structural reforms” scenario, greater product and labor market efficiency
leads to sizeable economic gains, resulting in higher employment and output—around
3 percentage points each (Figure 6). The need for fiscal adjustment is, accordingly,
substantially lower than in the baseline scenario, by about 1 percent of GDP. These reforms,
combined with additional pension or other expenditure measures, would make room for
growth-enhancing tax cuts.

markets, would reduce the need for fiscal adjustment, creating much-needed room for tax
cuts (Figure 5). The staff and the officials agreed that these estimates were likely to
understate the required fiscal adjustment since they did not allow for factors such as the
likely rise in health care spending due to new expensive treatment methods, and a rise in
wage and non-wage costs of local governments.

21.
The mood of popular complacency about the challenge of aging has complicated
policymaking. The Finnish ethos of consensus had in the past served to mobilize popular
support behind difficult decisions at times of crises. However, with Finland’s recent
record of strong growth and fiscal surpluses, officials expressed frustration at the
task of overcoming the

22.
Pressures on public spending are unlikely to abate in the next few years.
Officials noted the narrowing margins under the expenditure ceilings and pointed to two
main sources of pressure in the coming years. Demographically driven increases in spending
were likely to result in rising transfers to local authorities. In addition, the decision to initiate
new infrastructure investments without explicit allocations inside the spending ceiling was
adding to spending pressures. Over the medium term, areas that offered scope for savings
included education subsidies, public pensions and improved efficiency in the provision of
public services—particularly those provided at the local level.
23.
The authorities agreed that local government finances are increasingly a cause
for concern. The local sector, providing a large share of the education and social services
and accounting for the bulk of public employment, has experienced rapid growth in
consumption in recent years. Declining efficiency of spending, combined with excessive
reliance on volatile corporate profit tax bases, has obliged local governments to raise income
tax rates, partially offsetting central government efforts to reduce taxation. The authorities
planned limited reforms to municipal finances including abolition of the automatic
adjustment of state grants when local spending exceeds plans. The mission argued that, over
the longer term, a shift from relatively cyclical tax bases to property taxes may be needed.
This option was, however, regarded as politically infeasible, in view of the widespread home
ownership.

- 20 -

B. Labor Market Policies and Pension Reforms
24.
Reducing taxation of labor has been a key element of the authorities’ efforts to
promote employment. In view of the particularly high tax wedge at the low end of the wage
distribution, the authorities have tried to target tax reductions at the low-income earners.
Considerable evidence suggested that targeted reductions in social insurance contributions by
employers of the low skilled (and low paid) was a more effective policy to promote
employment than across-the-board tax cuts.4 While noting that tax cuts implemented in the
context of incomes policy accords tended to be more of the latter variety, officials pointed to
their efforts to tilt tax cuts towards the low-paid and the decision to reduce their payroll taxes
in 2006. There was also a case to reduce high marginal tax rates at the upper end of the wage
distribution to attract and retain skilled labor. The recent report of the Globalization
Committee had recommended across-the board tax cuts to encourage work effort. The
mission argued that, while a more substantial reduction in overall labor taxation was clearly
desirable, it should occur only when offsetting expenditure cuts are secured.
25.
The authorities are mindful of the necessity for a broader structural agenda to
achieve their ambitious employment target. The expected further decline in the
employment rate to 67 percent in 2004 underlined the demanding nature of the official
objective of raising it to 70 percent. While reducing the tax wedge on labor would help
stimulate employment,5 officials agreed that incentives remained for workers to leave the
labor force too early and enter it quite late, given the almost free education and generous
subsidies. The authorities planned to shorten further the average time spent in tertiary
education, by putting in place a two-tier university degree structure in 2005. The use of study
loans rather than grants is also under consideration. However, since unemployment primarily
afflicted the unskilled, both young and old, the authorities’ approach focused on easing labor
taxation, improving active labor market policies and securing a moderate wage accords that
would gradually allow for greater flexibility in wage-setting.
26.
Finland has generally attracted lower immigration than the other Nordic or the
larger EU countries. For instance, the share of foreign-born population in Finland in 2002
was less than 3 percent, compared with 6–7 percent in Denmark and Norway and almost
4

Such targeted cuts have shown positive effects in Belgium, France, the Netherlands, and
Spain, and are in line with the thinking of a study group set up in the Finnish Prime
Minister’s Office.

5

While the Finnish approach is in line with the EU’s Employment Guidelines of “making
taxation employment friendly,” the recent tax cuts have been relatively modest and, unless
supported by policies to reduce labor and product market rigidities, may fail to have a major
impact on employment. In this context, a recent survey of international experience is
suggestive. See Nickell, S. (2003), “Employment and Taxes,” CESifo Conference Paper,
July 2003 www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches/.

- 21 -

12 percent in Sweden. Officials noted that recent studies of migration from the Baltics
suggested no significant actual or prospective rise in labor inflows into the Nordic countries.
Nevertheless, Finland, along with most EU countries, has opted to introduce special
transition rules governing the right of access to its labor market for citizens from the new EU
member states.
27.
The authorities recognize that changes in the institutional arrangements of the
labor market are highly desirable. While the centralized wage determination had served to
moderate inflation, it had solidified wage rigidities that are unfavorable to the young and
unskilled workers. Globalization, with the attendant greater competition in product and labor
markets, had tended to alter the premises of centralized systems, as was evident in the trends
in the rest of the Nordic world. The Finnish trade unions, wedded to the traditional
“solidaristic” framework of wage bargaining, continued to place emphasis on job security
and effective “job-to-job” training. Nevertheless, officials viewed the recent wage accord as
marking a first step in the direction of more decentralized wage formation.
28.
The pension reform is expected to improve incentives for older workers to delay
exit from the labor force. The authorities believed that the tripartite agreement on the
reform package was a major achievement and stressed the critical importance of three
elements of the reforms in train: the automatic link of pensions to life expectancy; the nexus
of benefits to lifetime earnings in place of the earlier “ten-year rule”; and introduction of a
flexible retirement age. Officials argued that the impact of the changes already initiated
needed to be assessed before contemplating further measures. Officials did not dispute that
additional reforms such as further limiting the avenues to early retirement by closing the socalled “unemployment pipeline”—whereby the unemployed aged over 57 can continuously
claim benefits to age 65—were needed, but stressed the political difficulty of “selling” any
new reforms in the near term. The mission argued for early consideration of further reforms,
given the long phase-in periods required.
C.

Product Markets and Trade

countries. The sheltered sectors were characterized by relatively high market concentration,
high prices, lagging productivity, and significant state ownership. Officials believed that
privatization was likely to proceed only gradually. They agreed that despite Finland’s high
ranking in relatively “soft” measures of competitiveness (e.g., perceptions of corruption,
supportive legal environment, good educational system), it lagged behind in “hard” measures
(e.g., high tax rates, high compensation levels, high management remuneration). This
divergence might explain comparatively low levels of inward foreign direct investment.
30.
The authorities noted that competitive pressures were gradually increasing.
Competition in the retail sector had risen somewhat since EU accession, and although still
limited, had more recently led to a fall in food prices. Similarly, rising tax competition and
the revived role of regulatory authorities in sheltered sectors, including network industries,
also had a salutary impact. The Competition Authority’s legislation had been brought into
alignment with the EU competition law. The new legislation in place should allow the
Competition Authority to deal effectively with cartels. The planned reform of shop opening
hours is expected to enhance competition in the retail sector.
31.
Finland remains a strong supporter of the Doha Development Agenda, but
retains its heavy farm subsidization. Officials generally favored a multilateral trading
framework as superior to a series of bilateral agreements. While agreeing that a reduction in
Finland’s farm subsidies—even higher than the EU average—would raise efficiency and
consumer welfare, officials regretted that political difficulties would allow only a gradual
progress in this area. Finland’s official development assistance remained notable, budgeted to
rise to almost 0.4 percent of GDP in 2005 from around 0.35 percent in recent years.
D. The EMU Experience and the Financial Sector
32.
The authorities looked back on the experience of over five years in the EMU
with considerable satisfaction. Expectations at the time of entry into the euro area at the
beginning of 1999 had generally been met, while some of the concerns prevalent at the time
of entry had been belied. As expected, Finland had benefited from monetary stability and
lower interest rates. Officials noted that the effects of EMU entry were not easy to isolate
from other influences, especially since the economy had just recovered from a period of
severe recession and financial crisis at the time of entry. Despite initial concerns centered on
the risk of unfavorable asymmetric shocks, growth had been more rapid than in the euro area,
thanks to the boom in the high technology sector. The economy’s openness had increased
and, after several decades of deficits, large current account surpluses had emerged, even
during periods of robust growth. Looking ahead, as EU enlargement intensified competition
for placement of production and jobs, the challenge of adaptation for a country like Finland
with high tax rates and a large welfare state was clear.
33.
The financial sector appears ready for greater European market integration.
Officials noted that bank profitability remained healthy, the proportion of non-performing
loans extremely low, and stress tests suggested that banks could withstand extended
economic stagnation and a significant fall in asset prices (Table 5). Although household debt

- 23 -

as a proportion of disposable income had risen, it was still low in an international perspective
and there was little concern about the ability of households to service their debts. Increased
cross-border financial activities by systemically important institutions and the merger of the
Swedish and Finnish stock exchanges called for close cooperation among Nordic-Baltic
supervisors and new coordinated supervisory mechanisms. The authorities noted that crossborder financial transactions raised important policy questions for the EU as a whole, not
least regarding deposit insurance and the role of the lender of last resort.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
34.
Finland’s recent economic record has been impressive, but major challenges lie
ahead. The economy has weathered the global slowdown relatively well, with strong fiscal
stimulus helping to support economic growth. Inflation is low, the external position is
comfortable, and the public finances have recorded surpluses that remain among the largest
in the European Union. However, structural unemployment remains high, and looking ahead,
Finland faces a rapidly changing global and domestic environment that call for hard policy
choices.
35.
The longer term outlook is clouded by imminent population aging, and rigidities
in institutions that impede adaptation to change. With the adverse effects of aging
impacting Finland earlier than any other country in EU, the electoral arithmetic will begin to
shift soon against the constituency for reforms. While Finland enjoys the advantage of a
favorable initial position, with the public sector holding sizeable net assets and a significant
pension reform under way, the window for an effective and politically feasible policy
response is likely to close rapidly. An early pursuit of wide-ranging structural reforms would
help set in train a virtuous circle of higher employment and growth and stronger public
finances.
36.
Policy initiatives are needed to raise the employment rate—a precondition to
achieving fiscal sustainability. Given the incentives embedded in the current labor market
and education arrangements for workers to enter the labor market rather late and leave it too
early, achieving the authorities’ ambitious employment target would call for major policy
changes. Recent tax policy measures that reduce the burden of labor taxation will help
promote employment, particularly of the low-skilled, but are unlikely to be effective on their
own. Policies encompassing the tax-benefit system as well as product and labor market
arrangements are required to raise utilization of labor at both ends of the age spectrum. A
shift towards a more decentralized wage bargaining arrangement would ease the compressed
wage structure, allowing a greater correspondence between wage and productivity
differentials, and help reduce structural unemployment.
37.
In the absence of wide-ranging structural reforms, ensuring fiscal sustainability
would require sizeable general government surpluses for the rest of the decade. With the
stronger expected rise in age-related spending than elsewhere, reflecting the rapidity of aging
as well as Finland’s comprehensive welfare state, fiscal surpluses would provide a cushion to

- 24 -

absorb the coming demographic shock. Staff’s assessment suggests that the central and local
governments would need to run a combined annual surplus of the order of 1½ percent of
GDP, as compared with a projected deficit of over ¾ percent of GDP in 2005.
38.
With solid growth in prospect, the fiscal stimulus implied by the 2005 budget is
no longer necessary. The proposed cuts in taxation, including those announced in the
context of the recent wage round, should be offset by cuts in spending as the full tax package
is implemented. Over time, the beneficial effects on employment will be enhanced by tax
cuts targeted at the lower end of the income scale. The government’s intention to reduce
employers’ social security contributions for low-income workers in 2006 is an important step
in this direction.
39.
The room for a durable reduction in the taxation of labor should be created by
pruning public spending. The authorities’ objective to attain central government balance by
2007 will be feasible only if any new tax cuts or spending initiatives are offset by spending
cuts elsewhere and ceilings on expenditures observed scrupulously. Social transfers that deter
the effective utilization of labor could be reduced, with a focus on limiting incentives for
early retirement. A key avenue to easing pressures on public spending is to raise the
efficiency in the provision of social and welfare services. In order to place municipal
finances on a sound footing, a reassessment of their revenue sources may be necessary, with
consideration given to greater reliance on alternative sources such as property taxes.
40.
The pension reform to be phased in beginning next year is an important step
towards ensuring fiscal sustainability, but is, by itself, insufficient. The reform—with
commendable features such as an automatic adjustment for rising life expectancy, link of
benefits to life-time earnings, and sharply rising accrual rates at age 63—is expected to raise
the effective retirement age by almost two years. While the reform goes some way towards
promoting higher labor participation by limiting the avenues for leaving the labor market
early, important avenues to early exit from the labor force remain. To maximize the
beneficial impact of the reform on participation, the so-called “unemployment pipeline”
should be closed.
41.
The prospective shrinking of labor supply underlines the importance of
enhancing productivity. The high-technology sector has propelled the recent strong
productivity growth. Raising productivity in the sheltered sectors will require investment in
equipment and technology, in turn calling for a supportive economic and policy environment.
Reforms to promote greater flexibility in labor and product markets are likely to have a large
pay-off in terms of durable productivity gains throughout the economy.
42.
Strengthening competition further in product markets would complement
measures to improve the functioning of labor markets. Despite notable progress achieved
in recent years, especially in communications, air transport and retail trade, the price level
remains significantly above the EU average and scope exists to enhance competition.
Reducing rigidities that impair the functioning of product markets could have positive
spillover effects on the labor market. Competition between private and public sectors in the

- 25 -

provision of services could also be encouraged. Last but not least, Finland’s farm subsidies—
high even by EU standards—should be reduced in the interest of greater efficiency and
consumer welfare.
43.
The financial system is stable and is poised to benefit from increasing European
financial integration. However, growing cross-border financial activities by systemically
important institutions and the recent merger of the Swedish and Finnish stock exchanges
underline the importance of close cooperation among Nordic-Baltic supervisors and new
coordinated supervisory mechanisms.
44.

Finland’s high level of official development assistance is commendable.

45.

Sources: Ministry of Finance, Bank of Finland; and staff projections.
1/ Projections are staff estimates based on the authorities' current policy indications.
2/ Wages and salaries, plus employers' social security contributions, divided by working hours of employees.
3/ A negative value indicates a level of potential output that is larger than actual GDP.
4/ Using weights for real short- and long-term interest rates and the real effective exchange rate (ULC) of 1/3 each.
5/ On ESA95 basis.
6/ The fall in revenues in 2003 reflects, in part, planned cuts in some indirect taxes as well as the fading out of one-off factors
related to exceptional tax revenues due to income from stock options in earlier years.
7/ Defined as noninterest (structural) revenue minus noninterest (structural) expenditure.
8/ Corrected for the influence of the business cycle as measured by the output gap.
9/ One-off factors include exceptional tax revenues due to income from stock options.
10/ Includes stock-flow adjustements reflecting changes in the portfolio allocation of Finnish pension funds.
11/ For 2004-06, staff expects a current account balance that stays above 7 percent of GDP.
12/ Based on relative normalized unit labor costs.

Observation

Statement by David Farelius, Alternate Executive Director for Finland
and Satu Kivinen, Advisor to Executive Director
January 28, 2005
Our Finnish authorities wish to express their appreciation to Mr. Thakur and his team for the
constructive and candid exchange of views during the consultation visit and for the wellwritten reports. The authorities broadly agree with the staff assessment and view the reports
as a fair and balanced analysis of the economy, policies and prospects.
1. Recent economic developments and short-term prospects
Finland's GDP growth has exceeded the euro area average rate of growth by a good margin
in recent years, and according to the latest estimates, GDP growth was slightly above
3 percent in 2004. Last year, growth was sustained by stronger-than-expected domestic
demand and an uptick in the pace of global economic growth. In 2005, consumption is
projected to slow down, but the revival of exports coupled with strengthening corporate
investment is expected to support growth. In the recently updated Stability Program, the
growth projection for 2005 has been revised upwards to 2.8 percent. On balance, the
economic outlook for 2005 is comparatively good, though the risks of a slowdown in growth
have increased, particularly as regards raw material prices.
The current account surplus has amounted to 5 - 8 percent of GDP for a number of years
reflecting relatively low investment activity. In fact, Finland's investment ratio has remained
below the euro area average for a long time. In 2005, the current account is projected to
remain at 8 percent of GDP. Over the medium term, the current account is projected to
decline while still remaining in substantial surplus.
The pace of the rise in consumer prices has been clearly lower than was anticipated in the
previous Stability Program, and in 2004 inflation stood at 0.2 percent. Inflation, which has
been at very low levels partly because of exceptional factors (tax cuts of alcoholic beverages
and automobiles), is expected to accelerate somewhat.
Unemployment has remained "stubbornly high" to quote the staff. The unemployment rate
has stayed at near 9 percent, and the economy suffered substantial job losses in industry
during 2004. The fall in the number of employed, however, has stabilized, and the most
recent data show an increase in the number of employed. The employment rate, which has
been approaching 68 percent, will likely remain below the 70 percent target that was set by
the government in 2003 during this and next year.
Household real incomes have risen on average by 4 percent in 2004 and are forecast to grow
by nearly 2 percent both in 2005 and 2006. At the same time, boosted by rapid mortgage
borrowing, household indebtedness has also risen. The authorities do not see a real cause for
concern yet, because loan maturities have become longer and mortgage rates are at
historically low levels while housing prices continue to rise.

-22. Fiscal policy
Finland's public finances, measured by the general government financial balance, are
currently in a strong position. In the updated Stability Program, the projection for the general
government surplus in 2004 has been revised upwards by 0.3 percent to 2 percent, but it will
be somewhat weaker in 2005 (estimated at 1.8 percent before the recently agreed tax cuts).
Central government finances will be in balance in 2004 showing a stronger fiscal position
than was envisaged in the previous Stability Program. The general government debt levels
have also been revised downwards to 44.8 percent of GDP in 2004 and to 43.5 percent in
2005.
The government’s target is to balance central government finances by 2007. The government
is committed to keeping central government expenditure within the spending limits for 20042007 that were approved in May 2003. The fiscal policy stance has shifted from a very
expansionary phase in 2003 to a nearly neutral gear in 2004 and continues as neutral in 2005
and 2006.
The authorities and staff agree on the goal of streamlining public expenditures in exchange
for further tax cuts, which are necessary for raising employment as targeted in the
government program. The authorities believe that an important channel for increasing
savings is to raise the efficiency in the provision of public services, particularly at the local
level. Furthermore, it is important to keep increases in local taxes from offsetting government
efforts to lower the overall level of taxation.
The discussions on fiscal policy centered on maintenance of fiscal sustainability in the long
run in view of the diminishing labor input and rapidly aging population. The longer term
outlook is of concern once the costs of aging start to materialize around 2010. The authorities
share staff's view on the necessity of maintaining general government surpluses to meet the
rising costs of pension and health care services for the elderly. However, the authorities
consider that staff's suggestion to run a 4 percent general government surplus (including the
social security funds) for the rest of the decade is unrealistic. Nevertheless, the government is
well aware of the risks and challenges related to the goal of ensuring the long-term
sustainability. In addition to rigorous budget discipline, the positive outcome will depend on
an appropriate combination of reforms (labor market, pension and health care systems) and
measures to speed up the growth of productivity and employment.
In this context, raising labor supply and the employment rate play an important role. Staff
notes that labor supply is diminished at the young end due to late graduation from higher
education and early departure into retirement at the other end. Reforms to raise labor supply
at both ends of the age spectrum would be important for raising the employment rate. The
authorities are aware of this situation and measures are being implemented to speed up
graduation from universities. The enacted pension reform has already responded to the issue
at the other end of the age spectrum, whereby the actual retirement can be phased between
the ages from 63 until 68. Admittedly, it will take years before the effective retirement age
would rise from the present age of 59 years to 62 years. Before assessing the need for further
reforms, it is important to observe the effect of the current changes in the pension system.

-33. Labor market policies
The wage negotiations were conducted at the centralized level and agreed at the union level
late last year, and the government finalized its tax package with an elimination of the wealth
tax to take effect in 2006. The income agreement that was signed by the Social Partners in
November will run from March 1, 2005 until end September 2007. On an annual basis,
negotiated wages will rise on average by 2.1 % in 2005 and 1.6 % in 2006. The estimated
annual increases on earnings are 3.5 % in 2005 and 2.5 % in 2006. By now about 90 percent
of employees are covered by the new accord.
Staff's assessment seems to lean toward a decentralized wage settlement that would have
more accurately taken into consideration labor productivity differentials, with the likely
effect of reducing wage compression which is a characteristic and widely recognized feature
of the Finnish wage structure. However, it could be noted that the relative wage increases at
various wage levels are much more even than during the last few years and thus support good
employment development better than before.
While the Employment Contract Act and union-level agreements set rather tight limits to
local bargaining, the new agreement includes an understanding on improving the local
bargaining system to better meet the needs of both employers and the workforce. This kind of
local bargaining package is a new feature in the Finnish incomes policy settlements.
However, it does not necessarily mean a rapid passage from a centralized to a decentralized
wage bargaining regime. In addition, possibilities on local bargaining vary very much from
branch to branch. It is worth noting, however, that the present more centralized system has
worked well in Finland during the difficult times in the 1990s and until now. Furthermore,
the long wage accord together with cuts in income taxation will provide a stable and
predictable environment to pursue further reforms, as suggested by staff.
Raising the employment rate is high on the government’s policy agenda. Reducing the
taxation of labor has been a key element in pursuing this goal. The government will be
cutting labor taxes by a total of EUR 1.7 billion in gross terms between 2005 and 2007 with
the tax cuts weighted towards the lower end of the income scale. In addition to lowering
labor taxation, the government has also focused on improving active labor market policies.
4. Long-term challenges
The authorities agree with staff’s assessment that major challenges lie ahead as Finland faces
globalization, aging and structural unemployment remains high. Compared to many
European countries, the economy is in a good position to face these challenges as fiscal
stimulus has helped support growth during the global slowdown, inflation is low, the external
position is comfortable and public finances are in surplus. Moreover, Finland is relatively
well prepared for aging as pension liabilities have been partly pre-funded and the
implementation of a major pension reform has now begun. In addition, tighter central
government expenditure control, reduction of indebtness and fostering the growth potential
of the economy are all ways to prepare for the financing pressures arising from aging.

-4The authorities believe that it will be important to raise productivity in the sheltered sectors
of the economy, which has also been the advice by staff in earlier Article IV assessments.
The authorities share staff's view that strengthening competition in product markets,
promoting flexibility in labor markets, and diversifying the structure of the Finnish economy
could lead to a virtuous circle of higher growth and stronger public finances.
The authorities have also recently made sustainability scenarios for public finances in the
very long term, i.e. extending up to 2050. The scenarios use the national population estimates
with higher life expectancy estimates (than the Eurostat 1999 population estimates) and
naturally lead to higher estimates of public spending pressures. Notwithstanding the
uncertainty related to any such long term projections, the authorities’ baseline and alternative
scenarios also usefully demonstrate the effect structural reforms can have. The calculations
by the Ministry of Finance indicate that under the baseline scenario, the central and local
governments will not be on a sustainable basis without adaptive measures. However, merely
changing the assumption regarding the productivity of social and healthcare services (from
assuming no increase in productivity to assuming an annual increase of 0.5 percent) leads to
a substantial improvement in general government finances with the deficit at no stage
exceeding the 3 percent limit.
Finally, Finland, in principle, favors easing the access of developing countries' agricultural
products to industrial countries' markets and supports efforts to address this issue in the
context of multilateral trade negotiations. The government will increase funds for
development cooperation in accordance with its program so that based on the present
estimation of national income growth the ODA will be at the level of about 0.44 % of GNI in
2007. In the 2005 budget, the ODA share is estimated to account for 0.39 percent of GNI.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
February 7, 2005

International Monetary Fund

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2004 Article IV Consultation with Finland
On January 28, 2005, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Finland.1
Background
The Finnish economy has performed admirably in recent years, but must confront earlier than
any other country in the EU the pressures of population aging. The momentum of growth was
maintained, despite the receding role of the export-intensive high-technology electronics sector,
aided by a strong fiscal stimulus, although unemployment, largely structural, remains high.
Nevertheless, inflation is low and the fiscal and external current account surpluses are
comfortable. However, longer-term prospects are clouded by the imminent rise in old-age
dependency—the most rapid in Europe.
The economy weathered the global downturn relatively well, and in the near-term an improved
external climate is expected to strengthen growth. Strong domestic demand, especially private
consumption and residential investment, has buoyed the economy, reflecting strong disposable
income growth and low interest rates. Increased external demand is expected to make a larger
contribution in the near term, with growth averaging 3 percent in 2004-05. Inflation was largely
absent in 2004, following sizable excise cuts, and an appreciating euro which tempered the
increase in oil prices, but is expected to revert closer to that in the euro area average in 2005.
Strong productivity gains have helped contain unit labor costs and maintain competitiveness.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

-2A recent centralized wage accord covering a period of 2½ years is expected to ensure
continued wage moderation. However, a compressed wage structure and increased labor
market mismatches impede employment growth—despite significant cuts in labor taxation
(which nevertheless remains comparatively high)—with relatively low labor contributions from
both ends of the age spectrum, and from the less skilled. The unemployment rate has remained
broadly at 9 percent since 2000.
The fiscal position has rapidly eroded in recent years, but is expected to remain in surplus over
the medium term. While the decline in the surplus from 7 percent of GDP in 2000 is partly
cyclical, it is also the consequence of a sharp discretionary policy shift, with the structural
surplus declining by 3¼ percent of GDP by 2004. The 2005 budget is expansionary, with cuts in
corporate and capital taxes, and the beginning of a three-year labor income tax cut following the
wage agreement. Nevertheless, the general government fiscal balance is likely to remain at
about 2 percent of GDP, as the output gap closes. The government’s sizable net asset position,
equivalent to some 15 percent of GDP at the end of 2004, is expected to increase further.
Despite the benign short-term outlook, Finland’s long-term fiscal prospects are less comforting.
Aging-related fiscal pressures are anticipated to occur earlier than in most other EU countries,
and to be stronger, reflecting Finland’s comprehensive public welfare system. A significant
reform of the public pension system has been initiated, aiming to raise the effective retirement
age by 3 years from its current level of 59 years. However, the reform, by itself, is insufficient to
ensure fiscal sustainability.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for the impressive strides made by the Finnish
economy in recent years, aided by strong productivity gains and a stable macroeconomic policy
framework, with low inflation and sizeable fiscal surpluses. Directors noted, however, that
employment has remained stagnant, and structural unemployment high. They also underlined
that Finland will face the challenge of population aging earlier than any other country in the
European Union.
Directors stressed that economic diversification will be important to reduce Finland’s
vulnerability to downturns in the information and technology sector. Nevertheless, they
observed that the economy has weathered the global slowdown relatively well and that growth
is set to remain robust in 2005. The recent tax cuts are expected to stimulate employment, and
business investment is set to recover after a period of weakness. Although high oil prices and
further appreciation of the euro could pose risks to growth, Directors considered these risks to
be broadly offset by a likely faster pace of global recovery and strengthening export prospects.
As the impact of cuts in indirect taxation and other one-off factors recedes, inflation is expected
to revert to the average in the euro area.
Directors noted that while Finland’s fiscal position remains comfortable from a comparative EU
perspective, the general government surplus has eroded in recent years. They stressed that
sizeable fiscal adjustment will be required in the coming years to ensure long-term fiscal

-3sustainability, given the imminent demographic pressures on public finances. Directors
therefore recommended that the planned cuts in income taxes over the period 2005–07 be
offset by a reduction in public spending, preferably through improved efficiency in the provision
of social and welfare services. Such efficiency gains rather than tax increases should be the
preferred means of strengthening local government finances.
Directors argued that a holistic approach to structural reforms, setting in train a virtuous circle of
stronger employment, growth, and public finances is necessary to address effectively the
challenge of aging. Such comprehensive reforms would reduce the required fiscal adjustment.
Absent such reforms, the general government would have to run sizable surpluses to ensure
fiscal sustainability.
Directors called for policy initiatives to raise the employment rate, especially at both ends of the
age spectrum where labor utilization is relatively low. The recent steps to reduce the burden of
labor taxation will help promote employment, but may not be sufficient to attain the authorities’
ambitious target for raising the employment rate. Welcoming the authorities’ intention to reduce
employers’ social security contributions for low-income workers, Directors called for targeting
tax cuts at the lower end of the income scale in order to maximize the beneficial effects on
employment. A gradual shift to a more decentralized wage bargaining system would also help
ease wage compression and reduce structural unemployment, as would improved training for
low-skilled and older workers.
Directors welcomed the significant pension reform being phased in from the beginning of this
year as an important step toward ensuring fiscal sustainability. The reform, with commendable
features such as an automatic adjustment for rising life expectancy and sharply rising accrual
rates, goes some way toward promoting higher labor participation. However, the reform will
need to be followed up with further steps, such as closing the so-called “unemployment
pipeline,” whereby unemployed persons over 57 can claim benefits until age 65. Noting that a
consensus for structural reform may become more difficult to achieve in future years, Directors
called for early consideration of additional measures and for stepped-up efforts to raise public
awareness of the need for faster reform.
In Directors’ view, further strengthening competition in product markets would complement
efforts to improve labor market efficiency and accelerate the diffusion of productivity gains from
the technology sector to the rest of the economy. While commending the progress achieved in
recent years in promoting greater competition in sheltered sectors such as communications and
retail trade, Directors felt that considerable scope remains to enhance competition in the
sheltered sectors, given that the price level is still significantly above the EU average. In this
regard, a more proactive stance on foreign direct investment and privatization of public
enterprises would be helpful. A reduction in Finland’s farm subsidies, which are high by EU
standards, would also contribute to raising competition and consumer welfare.

-4Directors viewed the financial system as sound and resilient to economic shocks, and
considered that it is poised to gain from greater European market integration. They noted that
growing cross-border financial activity would call for increasingly closer cooperation among
Nordic-Baltic financial supervisors.
Directors expressed their appreciation for Finland’s strong record of official development
assistance (ODA) and the country’s support for increased market access for developing
countries’ agricultural exports through multilateral trade initiatives. They welcomed the 2005
budgeted increase in ODA and the authorities’ intention to continue to increase ODA as a
percent of gross national income in the future.
It is expected that the next Article IV consultation with Finland will be held on the standard 12month cycle.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.
