IMF Executive Board Approves Three-Year US$23.9 million Extended Credit facility
Arrangement for Guinea-Bissau and Concludes 2015 Article IV Consultation
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today approved a three-year
SDR 17.04 million (about US$23.9 million, 120 percent of quota) arrangement under the
Extended Credit Facility (ECF)1 for Guinea-Bissau and also concluded the 2015 Article IV
consultation.2 The approval enables the immediate disbursement of an amount equivalent to
SDR 2.84 million (about US$4.0 million, 20 percent of Guinea Bissau’s quota).
The authorities’ program, which is anchored on the government’s Strategic Plan for
2014–18, aims to consolidate the fiscal position through better expenditure management and
enhanced revenue mobilization, deepen institutional reforms, mitigate vulnerabilities, and
develop the private sector to support growth and job creation. The program focuses on
improving the policy framework by addressing governance and security issues, strengthening
budgetary transparency as well as public investment and debt management, and improving
compilation of statistics.
Following the Executive Board discussion on Guinea-Bissau, Mr. Mitsuhiro Furusawa,
Deputy Managing Director and Acting Chair, made the following statement:
1

The ECF provides financial assistance to all countries eligible for support under the Fund’s Poverty reduction
and Growth Trust (PRGT), and who have protracted balance of payments problems (i.e. when the resolution of
the underlying macroeconomic imbalances would be expected to extend over the medium to long term). It
supports the countries’ economic programs aimed at moving toward a stable and sustainable macroeconomic
position consistent with strong and durable poverty reduction and growth. Access to ECF financing is
determined on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the country’s balance of payments need and strength
of its economic program, and is guided by access norms. Financing under the ECF carries a zero interest
through end-2016, has a grace period of 5½ years, and a final maturity of 10 years. The Fund reviews the level
of interest rates for all concessional facilities under the PRGT every two years, with the next review expected
to take place at end-2016.

2

Under Article IV of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information and discusses
with officials the country’s economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares
a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

2

“Guinea-Bissau’s new government has taken important steps to foster political stability and
resume stalled reforms. The authorities’ economic program involves appropriately ambitious
goals, notably strengthening the fiscal position, safeguarding financial stability, and
improving the business environment. Nonetheless, the challenges ahead remain significant,
and include an underfunded security sector reform, significant infrastructure gaps, and
widespread poverty. The success of the program hinges on a satisfactory implementation of
the authorities’ policy commitments, broad popular support, and continued assistance from
Guinea-Bissau’s development partners.
“The authorities’ focus on fiscal reforms to improve budget execution and public financial
management is welcome. Enhancing revenue mobilization will be important to create fiscal
space for badly needed infrastructure and social spending. An effective debt management
calls for a prompt upgrade of current practices and continued reliance on concessional
borrowing.
“The authorities’ decision not to deploy scarce public resources to shore up troubled banks is
in line with international best practice and welcomed. Safeguarding financial stability calls
for heightened supervisory vigilance in the period ahead as well as closer collaboration with
the WAEMU Banking Commission.
“Structural reforms will be necessary to promote economic diversification and more
inclusive growth. Stepped up efforts to improve the business environment, including broader
access to financial services, should boost Guinea-Bissau’s competitiveness and help reduce
poverty. A bold overhaul or closure of the fund to promote agricultural development, in line
with the findings from an audit underway, could pave the way for vigorous private sector
development in a key sector.”
In November 2014, the IMF approved support for Guinea-Bissau under the Rapid Credit
Facility to meet balance of payments financing needs and to catalyze additional development
partner support. Since then, the newly-elected government has taken action to confront the
country’s economic and social challenges, and development partner support has been rekindred. The authorities instituted quick-win measures, including the setting up of a Treasury
management committee and diverse measures to enhance domestic revenue mobilization. To
mobilize development partner support for their Strategic Plan, the government organized a
donor roundtable in Brussels in March this year, which yielded significant pledges from
development partners.
Economic growth recovered in 2014, consumer price inflation declined, and external
balances improved while the fiscal position deteriorated slightly. With a favorable cashew
nuts harvest and a pickup in construction and telecommunication services, real GDP growth
is estimated at 2½ percent in 2014 (up from 0.8 percent in 2013). Reflecting depressed
domestic demand and weakening in global food and fuel prices, consumer prices were
depressed, and average inflation declined to -1 percent. Economic activity is projected to

3

pick up, with growth averaging around 4.7 percent in 2015–16, supported by the same
drivers and pick-up in public investment.
The medium-term prospects for economic advancement and poverty reduction in Guinea
Bissau hinge on addressing pervasive economic and political vulnerabilities. In addition to
the security sector reform, this calls for structural reforms on a broad front to diversify the
economy and improve governance and the business environment for private sector
development and job creation.
The Executive Board also completed the 2015 Article IV consultation with Guinea-Bissau.
Executive Board Assessment3
“Executive Directors agreed with the thrust of the staff appraisal. They commended the
authorities for their determination to foster political and macroeconomic stability. However,
noting that Guinea-Bissau still faces significant socio-economic challenges, Directors
emphasized the need for continued strong commitment to prudent policies and
comprehensive reforms. They agreed that the resumption of financial support from
development partners will be critical to improving the country’s economic prospects and
reducing poverty.
“Directors emphasized the importance of fiscal discipline and efficient public spending. They
encouraged sustained efforts to strengthen revenue mobilization and create additional fiscal
space to address Guinea-Bissau’s vast development shortfalls. In particular, Directors
highlighted the need to strengthen public financial management, notably budget execution
processes. They also called for continued progress with security sector reform.
“Directors emphasized the importance of securing a sustainable fiscal position by seeking
financing on highly-concessional terms. Prudent borrowing will be essential in the light of
Guinea-Bissau’s large public investment plans and its vulnerability to shocks.
“Directors agreed that financial sector stability is critical for growth. In this regard, they
encouraged the authorities to reinforce the banking system especially by strengthening bank
oversight and addressing non-performing loans. Steps to promote financial deepening in
collaboration with the relevant monetary union institutions will also be important.
“Directors stressed that structural reforms are necessary to bolster competitiveness and
achieve diversified and inclusive growth. They agreed that, in order to boost private sector
activity, priority should be given to enhancing the business environment, and improving
infrastructure and access to financial services. Directors welcomed the audit of the fund to

promote agricultural development, and encouraged the authorities to overhaul its governance
and operations in light of the findings.
“Directors stressed the importance of improving the quality and timeliness Guinea-Bissau’s
economic statistics. They encouraged the authorities to improve coordination among the
various institutions involved in data production and ensure that adequate resources are
allocated to them.
“It is expected that the next Article IV Consultation with Guinea-Bissau will be held in
accordance with the Executive Board decision on consultation cycle for members with Fund
arrangements.”

Contribution to the growth of broad money in percent.

One-off revenues amounted to 0.9 percent of GDP in 2014 (due to FUNPI's proceeds being transferred to the Treasury) and are expected to account for 0.5 percent of GDP in
2015 (due to the selling of 3G licenses) and 1.6 percent of GDP in 2016 (mostly due to revenue from the selling of seized illegal wood and the collection of associated taxes).

`

GUINEA-BISSAU
June 24, 2015

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
AND REQUEST FOR A THREE-YEAR ARRANGEMENT UNDER
THE EXTENDED CREDIT FACILITY

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Context: A series of coups d’état since independence have resulted in chronic political
instability and deterred economic and social progress. Guinea-Bissau has re-initiated
progress since the assumption of office of the current inclusive government in mid-2014.
The economy is now recovering after a decline in 2012 and marginal growth in 2013.
Inflation remains low, and socio-political stability seems achievable. The coup d’état of
April 2012 stalled implementation of the three-year Extended Credit Facility (ECF)supported program approved by the Board in May 2010, and the arrangement lapsed
subsequently. The Fund’s support under the Rapid Credit Facility (RCF) disbursement of
2014 and the authorities’ commitment to reforms have re-ignited donor confidence.
Article IV Discussions. Policy discussions focused on measures to overcome fragility;
fiscal consolidation and public financial management reforms; restoring financial stability;
borrowing policies and long-term debt sustainability; private sector development and
structural reforms to enhance inclusive growth prospects.
The Proposed Program. The authorities’ development program, anchored on the
Strategic Plan for 2014–18, aims to consolidate the fiscal position through better
expenditure management and enhanced revenue mobilization, deepen institutional
reform, mitigate vulnerabilities, and develop the private sector to support growth and
employment. The program focuses on improving the policy framework by addressing
governance and security issues, strengthening budgetary transparency as well as public
investment and debt management, and improving compilation of statistics. Structural
benchmarks focus on these issues while QPCs include a floor on revenues collection and
a ceiling on net credit to government (the anchor of the program).
Request for an Extended Credit Facility Arrangement. To support their medium-term
economic reform program, the authorities request a three-year arrangement under the
ECF in an amount equivalent to SDR 17.04 million (120 percent of quota).
Risks to the program include the still fragile political situation, which could delay
implementation of reforms, adverse terms of trade developments, and weakening donor
confidence, and the heightened risk of incursion of the Ebola virus from neighboring
countries.

BACKGROUND: TAKING STOCK
A. Addressing Political Stability and Related Challenges
1.
Since independence in 1974, Guinea-Bissau has had 18 actual, attempted or alleged
military coups; the resultant chronic political instability deterred growth. The last coup d’état
took place in April 2012 in the midst of the presidential election and interrupted an otherwise
successful three-year ECF-supported program. Its effects were profound, as external financing and
tax collection collapsed, and political uncertainty under the transitional government formed in May
2012 fostered rent-seeking and corruption. Following pressure and financial support from the
international community, successful presidential and parliamentary elections brought President
Vaz’s government into power in July 2014. The security situation remains calm. A multi-party
commission has been set up to review the constitution with the aim of clarifying the respective
competencies of the President and the Prime Minister. In parallel, the government has initiated a
comprehensive security sector reform that seeks to address pension benefits of the security forces,
improve the efficiency of the national army, and end the recurrence of coups.
2.
The April 2012 coup coupled with a fall in cashew nut prices exacerbated economic
fragility and heightened food insecurity and poverty. Between 2012 and 2013, the Bissau–
Guinean economy was hit by a 40 percent fall in the international price of cashew nuts, contributing
to large trade deficits, despite a compression of imports. The external current account balance
deteriorated by almost 13 percentage points of GDP during 2012–13; the overall balance of
payments deteriorated as well and was financed mainly by drawing down government deposits at
the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) as financial support from traditional foreign
partners was suspended. The domestic impact of the shock was a large decline in farm-gate cashew
nut prices by over 60 percent, and poverty soared. At the same time, food insecurity doubled to
40 percent in 2013, according to a survey by the World Food Program.
3.
The reduction of international support and the institutional decay deteriorated public
finances and depressed economic activity. Despite scaling back current and capital spending, the
government accumulated domestic and external arrears and social conditions worsened (which,
among other things, ignited teacher strikes). The cash-strapped government increased its reliance
on simplified spending procedures.1 The economically disruptive coup d’état exacerbated the
chronic regulatory forbearance in the banking sector, leaving two of the four banks with excessive
levels of nonperforming loans.2 In 2012 the economy contracted by 1.8 percent and barely
recovered in 2013 with a growth of 0.8 percent (Text Table 1).

In July 2014, the new democratically-elected government initiated an ambitious
reform agenda to address Guinea-Bissau’s developmental challenges within the framework of
strategic plan with donor support. The government has recently adopted a Strategic Plan that
aims to consolidate past progress and advance socio-economic development in 2014–18, and
launch Guinea-Bissau onto a virtuous cycle of progress by 2025. Encouraged by the renewed
commitment of the country, development partners resumed support, and reaffirmed this through
commitments at the roundtable held in Brussels on March 25, 2015 (Box 1). Prior to this, the IMF
provided policy advice and financing in November 2014 under the Rapid Credit Facility to help
address the country’s urgent balance of payments and fiscal needs. The government successfully
issued FCFA 15 billion in Treasury bonds to clear wage arrears, and prepared 2014 and 2015
budgets that were approved unanimously by the Parliament. While reforms largely halted under the
military and transitional governments, the newly elected authorities have generally been responsive
to Fund policy advice, and continue to build on technical assistance (TA) recommendations to
advance structural reforms and improve policy formulation (Box 2).
Box 1. Outcome of the Brussels Donor Roundtable of March 25, 2015
The Government prepared a 10-year development and transformation plan with an intermediate 2020 milestone,
consisting of six axes, twenty-three fields of actions, fifty-three programs and 115 projects for a cost of
US$2.1 billion. At the Brussels roundtable, bilateral and multilateral development partners pledged approximately
US$1.5 billion, of which 40 percent would be grants, 30 percent loans and the conditions for the remainder yet to
be determined.
The annual and sectoral breakdown of the pledges is yet to be confirmed. About US$48.2 million (out of an
estimated cost of US$82 million) for the special pension fund for demobilization of army personnel have been
committed so far by international partners. However, the details of a more comprehensive reform–with a possible
cost of US$260 million, as presented at the roundtable–are yet to be defined.
The current macroeconomic framework integrates foreign-financed public investment of US$545 million for
2015–20, significantly less than pledged but a substantial scaling up compared to the past. This excludes any
envisaged amounts for the security sector reform, which is expected to be financed from both foreign and domestic
sources (including budgetary transfers into the special pension fund). The public investment program would be
adjusted as more information becomes available.

Box 2. Guinea-Bissau: Response to Fund Advice from the 2013 Article IV Consultation
Fund Advice

Response

Restore macroeconomic
stability and foster economic
growth by putting in place the
conditions required for political
stability and sustained support
from development partners.

While progress was limited under the transitional government, the new
government formed in 2014 sought political unity upon assumption of office and
stepped up implementation of Fund advice. They initiated structural reforms that
have begun to show good results in strengthened efficiency at the revenue
authority. The government has adopted a Strategic Plan to address the country’s
developmental needs and catapult it onto a virtuous cycle of progress by 2025.
For the medium-term, 2015–18, the plan aims to boost infrastructure
investments, encourage industrialization and promote urban development. The
plan drew considerable support from development partners at the Brussels
Roundtable in March 2015. The authorities have embarked on a security sector
reform focused at promoting professionalism in the security forces.

Adopt a prudent budget for
2013, which should be based
on realistic revenue and
financing estimates, and
implement strict budgetary
management in the face of
tight financing constraints.

While the 2013 budget was not fully implemented by the transition government,
the new government presented in late-2014, the 2014, and 2015 budgets to
parliament and got them unanimously approved. Furthermore, the authorities
established a Treasury committee that aims at tightening expenditure
commitment procedures to improve non-priority spending monitoring and
contain them to budgeted levels.

Enhance growth prospects;
improving the business
environment; promoting
economic diversification;
increasing access to finance;
and maintaining debt
sustainability.

To strengthen the business environment, the authorities have committed to audit
the hitherto ill-managed fund for industrialization of agricultural products
(FUNPI), and are determined to use the results from the audit to restructure or
completely eliminate the fund. They continue to implement a fuel pricing
mechanism that adjusts domestic pump prices to international price movements.
The authorities have extended SYDONIA ++ (a global software for capturing and
reporting customs data) to one major entry port, tightened controls over fuel
imports and streamlining fuel tax exceptions, intensified audits of large
taxpayers, established Bissau Link—a system for tax risk assessment of imports
and scanning of containers—and set up a one-stop shop for potential investors.

B. Assessment of the Last ECF-Supported Program
5.
Performance under the previous ECF-supported program (May 2010–May 2012) was
overall positive.3 Prior to the 2012 coup d’état, macroeconomic stability had improved and
economic growth accelerated, while consumer price inflation rose as global food and fuel prices
soared. Structural reforms included in the ECF-supported program included measures to restore
fiscal sustainability, strengthen institutions, and reduce widespread poverty—most of these
measures required TA and support from development partners. Progress in implementing measures
to bolster public financial management was largely positive with some advancements made in tax

The Board approved a new three-year ECF arrangement on May 7, 2010 (SDR 22.365 million). On December 2, 2011,
the Board completed the third review and approved SDR 2.414 million of disbursement. The program was disrupted
by the coup d’état of April 2012, and lapsed subsequently.

and customs administration, including the adoption of indicative ceilings on exempted fuel imports
by embassies and international organizations, preparation of a comprehensive inventory of non-tax
revenues, and establishment of SYDONIA++ in two border posts. Public debt management was
strengthened through the introduction and use of DMFAS to record, monitor, and manage all public
debt (external and domestic).

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND
SHORT-TERM OUTLOOK
6.
Economic growth recovered in 2014, while inflation remained muted due to weak
domestic demand (Figure 2 and Table 1). With a favorable cashew nuts harvest and a pickup in
construction and telecommunication services, real GDP growth is estimated at 2½ percent in 2014
(up from 0.8 percent in 2013). Reflecting depressed domestic demand during the first half of 2014
and weakening in global food and fuel prices, consumer prices were depressed, and average
inflation declined to -1 percent. Growth is projected to average around 4.7 percent in 2015,
supported by the same drivers and continued public investment (MEFP ¶¶12, 13, and 14).
7.
Domestic revenue mobilization exceeded expectations on account of quick-win
measures (Tables 2 and Figure 3). Customs and tax revenues improved sharply in 2014 (by
39 percent and 9 percent, respectively), as the government tightened controls over fuel imports and
streamlined tax exemptions (mainly on fuel), rehabilitated customs posts and intensified auditing of
large taxpayers. These measures, coupled with the increase in tax revenues on account of output
expansion and collection of FUNPI-related receipts by the Treasury (1 percent of GDP), increased
total revenues to 12.0 percent of GDP in 2014 (from 8.1 percent in 2013). Expenditures also
increased sharply in 2014 due to one-off spending related to elections, earmarked spending linked
to EU fishing compensation, which resumed in 2014, as well as accounting of expenses that were
previously recorded outside the budget.
8.
Enhanced revenue mobilization enabled the government to clear a large amount of
arrears accrued in recent years. The increase in revenues, the financial assistance from the World
Bank through the payment of six months of teachers and health workers’ salaries, and the
placement of CFA 15 billion (2.7 percent of GDP) in one-year Treasury bills on the regional capital
market, allowed the government to clear almost all wage arrears.4 At the same time, the government
cleared all external arrears (excluding debt in technical arrears for which the government is reaching
out to the creditors to start or formalize rescheduling negotiations).5

4

Guinea-Bissau has an old stock of domestic arrears dating to before 2013 and estimated at around 10 percent of
GDP. However, only 26 percent of these arrears have been audited and recognized by the Government.

5

The Government also has quota membership arrears to several international organizations, and is devising a plan to
deal with them. It is making best efforts to conclude rescheduling agreements with the bilateral creditors, and has a
credible plan and projected financing in place to eliminate the arrears with multilateral creditors.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

GUINEA-BISSAU

9.
The external position improved significantly in 2014, and the real effective exchange
rate appears to be in line with fundamentals (Table 4, Figure 2, and SIP section II). The current
account deficit dropped from 4.4 percent of GDP in 2013 to 1.2 percent in 2014. The improvement
reflects an increase in cashew-nuts export value, and more generally a sharp improvement in the
terms of trade (31.4 percent) as cashew nut prices increased, global food and fuel prices declined,
and current transfers increased substantially. The terms of trade are expected to improve further in
2015, and cashew export volumes to increase somewhat. Nevertheless, the current account deficit
would increase to 3.6 percent of GDP on account of an expected increase in imports as foreign
investment is scaled up and incomes recover, particularly in the context of the resumption of
traditional support by development partners as expressed in the promising results of the recent
roundtable conference. (Box 1 and MEFP ¶2). Based on the external balance assessment for
emerging markets and developing countries (“EBA-lite”) Guinea-Bissau’s and the WAEMU region’s
real effective exchange rate appears to be broadly in line with fundamentals.

MEDIUM-TERM FRAMEWORK
10.
Creating employment opportunities and reducing poverty through sustained and
inclusive growth are key objectives of the authorities’ medium-term policy framework. Under
their development strategy for 2014–18, the authorities aim to reach these objectives by
strengthening fiscal consolidation efforts through public financial management (PFM) and tax
reforms, ensuring that economic policies support macroeconomic stability, stepping up
implementation of structural reforms to improve the business environment, and enhancing human
capital development by improving the quality of public service and access to education, health and
social protection. The resumption of financial support from traditional development partners is
critical for medium-term economic prospects and poverty reduction.
Staff’s assessment
11.
The medium-term macroeconomic framework underpinning the ECF-supported
program being requested by the authorities is consistent with their Strategic Plan (MEFP ¶¶12
and 13). It points to a favorable outlook with sustained growth, low inflation, and improving fiscal
balances. The overall external position is expected to improve after a transitory worsening of the
current account balance.



Growth prospects for 2015–18 are supported by buoyant cashew nuts production and
diversification of agriculture; public investment spending financed by development partners as per
commitments from the Brussels Donor Roundtable in March 2015, and continued expansion of the
communication and other services sectors. Baseline projections show that growth is expected to
average 4.9 percent per year. Achievement of this growth profile relies heavily on realization of
donor commitments at the Brussels Roundtable, which anticipates some US$1.5 billions to
support the government’s 10-year development and transformation plan. Staff stressed that
effective public investment management, and structural reforms to improve the business
environment would be needed to further enhance medium-term growth prospects.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

9

GUINEA-BISSAU



Inflation is expected to pick up as economic activity expands and incomes recover. Continued
weakening in global food prices along with the authorities’ planned measures to support
agricultural production and diversification would help dampen food inflation somewhat.
Reflecting these expectations, average inflation is projected to increase to 1.3 percent in 2015,
2.3 percent in 2016 and average just under 3 percent in 2017–18 (Text Table 2 and Figure 4).



While the current account deficit would increase in the next years, the overall external position
would improve in the medium term. The external current account deficit is projected to widen to
around 6 percent of GDP by 2018, owing to increased capital imports financed by increased
foreign direct investment, project grants and highly concessional loans. With the increase in
financial inflows, the overall balance of payments should improve (Text Table 2 and Figure 4).

12.
The economic outlook is favorable but subject to considerable risks (Appendix II).
Downside risks could arise from adverse terms of trade, weakening of donor confidence, and
unexpected political disruptions. At the same time, the heightened risk of incursion of the Ebola
virus from neighboring countries into Guinea-Bissau, if realized, could impose significant human and
economic costs on the economy and stall program implementation. On the upside, the risks stem
from unexpected surges in business confidence on account of the success of the Brussels
Roundtable, a stable political climate, and firmer commitment to policy implementation.
Authorities’ views
13.
The authorities agreed with staff’s medium-term projections and assessment of
associated risks, but maintained that the growth prospects would be brighter than foreseen.
They emphasized that with resumption of development partner support and the determination of
the new government to implement reforms to improve the business environment, address the
infrastructure gap, and enhance public service delivery, economic growth could rebound faster than
in staff’s assessment. While acknowledging the possibility of the downside risks to the economic
outlook, they accentuated the upside risks. They informed staff that they were taking measures, with
support of development partners, to forestall the spread of the Ebola virus in Guinea-Bissau.

GUINEA-BISSAU

POLICY DISCUSSIONS AND THE PROPOSED PROGRAM
A. Overcoming Fragility
14.
Fragility in Guinea-Bissau has been fueled by political instability, mainly through
military coups d’état that disrupt the continuity of programs and structural reforms and
hinder socio-economic progress (SIP section I). To address the burden of recurrent coups d’état by
ill-controlled elements of the military forces, the government plans to restructure and modernize the
defense and security sectors, including de-mobilizing excess troops. The government’s objective is
to reduce the military forces gradually to around 3,500. Reaching this goal would require retiring
some 2,500 military personnel. The government also plans to rationalize the security forces. The cost
of the security sector reform has been estimated at US$260 million, or a fraction of the estimated
cost of fragility: for example, real per capita GDP could have been at least two thirds higher in 2013
had there been political stability since the end of the civil war in 1999.
Staff’s assessment
15.
In order to break from the past of economic stagnation the government needs to
preserve political stability by reforming its security sector and by building a strong national
consensus for its reform agenda. The last military coup d’état in April 2012 took a significant toll
on the economy. Plagued by weak governance and growing corruption, rent seeking behavior
soared, domestic revenue mobilization fell, and external financing shrunk. As a result, infrastructure
investment and social spending declined and poverty soared. The new government that was elected
in mid-2014 has made significant progress in tackling all of these issues. Staff underlined that
sustained reform efforts, including security sector reform, would be critical to ensure durable
economic and political stability and a decisive break with fragility (see SIP, section I).
Authorities’ views
16.
The authorities concurred with staff on the key role of political stability for sustained
economic growth and development, and are committed to implementing the security sector
reform. They recognize that chronic political instability has taken a heavy toll on social and
economic progress in Guinea-Bissau, and that political stability is a necessary condition for longterm inclusive growth. They are committed to break with the past of instability and poor governance
and start implementing the security sector reform in 2015. They intend to retire the first group of
500 soldiers by the end of the year, and continue discussions with development partners on the
implementation of the wider security sector reform.

B. Stepping Up Fiscal Reforms
17.
Despite recent improvements, domestic revenue mobilization remains weak, along
with expenditure and debt management. The 2012 coup d’état and its resultant adverse impact
on economic activities eroded the tax base and weakened tax administration. Consequently, tax

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

GUINEA-BISSAU

performance and buoyancy declined. In 2012, the tax-GDP ratio declined to 7.7 percent of GDP, and
further to 7.0 percent in 2013, the lowest among all countries in SSA. Recent efforts by the
authorities to enhance tax administration have yielded some gains, but the tax gap (between
potential and actual tax collections) remains large (Box 3). In addition to eroding the revenue base,
the coup d’état undermined fiscal discipline. This resulted in the proliferation of expenditures outside
formal channels, the accumulation of domestic and external arrears, and subsequent disruptions in
public services. Finally, the inefficient public electricity and water company (EAGB) is a drain on
public finances. In 2015 alone, the Government is making transfers of CFA 2.8 billion to EAGB to
cover current and past losses.
18.
Building debt management capacity remains a challenge. Following a significant buildup in domestic debt in recent years, partly to finance infrastructure projects, the fiscal strategy
adopts a zero-ceiling on domestic financing and anticipates a decline in the stock of domestic debt
over the medium term. At the same time, the authorities are in discussions with WAEMU to help
cover part of the interest costs of any new contracting of debt from BOAD, which would make the
loans concessional. On this basis, domestic debt is projected to decline by 2.7 percentage points of
GDP to 30.2 percent of GDP by the end of the ECF program. The authorities have requested TA from
IMF AFRITAC West to bolster debt management, including by reviewing the legal and institutional
framework for public debt management and the process of public debt contracting.
Staff’s assessment
19.
The authorities’ medium-term fiscal strategy should aim to achieve a sustainable fiscal
position to support macroeconomic stability and long-term debt sustainability (MEFP ¶15–24).
To build on the recent strong performance focused at addressing lapses, in revenue mobilization,
PFM, and debt management, staff discussed with the authorities a broad set of measures to:



Strengthen revenue mobilization. Key measures include: (i) implementing an intra-trade post in
Safim(a major border post) to reconcile invoice merchandise data with actual contents of the
cargo, and expansion of SYDONIA ++ to remaining posts (structural benchmark); (ii) drawing up
a strategic plan for improving infrastructure and working conditions of officials of the domestic
tax and customs administration; and (iii) implementing a new small-taxpayer regime through the
introduction of taxpayer identification numbers (structural benchmark). Staff stressed the need
to steadfastly implement these measures to expand the country’s tax base, which is low
compared to peers and all sub-Saharan Africa countries, as a reliable domestic source of
financing the budget.



Increase efficiency of public spending and improve controls. Infrastructure investment and other
pro-poor spending will remain important priorities, while growth in spending on goods and
services as well as wages and salaries will be muted in the medium term. To strengthen the
efficiency of public investment management, the authorities will prepare quarterly reports on
the execution of the public investment program (PIP) (structural benchmark). They are also
committed to prepare a comprehensive study of the current mechanism of fuel pricing and
subsidies. Although the government removed all fuel subsidies, it nonetheless intends to review
its current fuel price mechanism to ensure that international prices are fully passed-through to

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

GUINEA-BISSAU

domestic retail prices and that price movements are shielded from political interference (Box 4).
Staff underscored the need for continued expenditure restraint in view of the low revenue base
and financing constraints.



Accelerate PFM reforms. Steps to address weaknesses in budget processes and expenditure
management will be critical to meet fiscal targets. They include strengthening public financial
management through weekly Treasury Committee meetings, and creating a single treasury
account to instill transparency and accountability of budgetary funds. In this connection, the
authorities will prepare a monthly rolling Treasury cash flow projection table consistent with the
2015 budget (structural benchmark). In addition, by March 2016, the authorities intend to
prepare an inventory of all revenue sources and government accounts, and require that revenue
collections be exclusively through the banking system (MEFP ¶19).



Restore the government’s credibility by clearing remaining domestic arrears (MEFP ¶15). The 2015
spending plans include the clearance of all outstanding domestic arrears from 2013–14
(CFA 0.5 billion for teachers’ bonuses and CFA 2.4 billion to embassies). In addition, older arrears
will also be cleared in 2016 after due audits and verification of the claims and the claimants’
fiscal compliance. The government intends to start clearance of these arrears in 2016 with a cash
payment of CFA 3 billion and issuance of treasury bonds with maturities ranging from one to six
years to cover the remaining balance.
Box 3. Guinea-Bissau: Tax Potential versus Performance, 2001–14

Notwithstanding recent gains in tax administration that have boosted tax revenues, tax effort in GuineaBissau remains low and tax-GDP ratio is correspondingly low compared to peer countries in Sub-Saharan
Africa. Panel econometric exercises carried out to investigate the extent of the tax gap, estimate the gap at
around 12 percent of GDP in 2014.
A panel econometric analysis suggests a substantial gap between tax potential and actual tax
collection in Guinea-Bissau. The analysis uses a stochastic

from 16 percent in 2004 to around 12 percent of GDP
in 2014. The tax effort (i.e., the actual tax collection relative to the taxable capacity) increased from 21 percent
in 2004 to around 42 percent in 2014. This implies that the recent improvements in tax revenue are mainly
due to an improved tax administration rather than to an increase in the “broadly-defined” tax potential itself.
Guinea-Bissau’s tax revenue has not kept up pace with economic growth. The country’s revenue
buoyancies are below unity, just as in SSA fragile states, but below all WAEMU and SSA averages for all three
categories of taxes during 2000–11. At 0.73, the estimated average tax buoyancy for Guinea-Bissau fell below
the estimates for WAEMU (0.76), SSA (0.84) and SSA fragile states (0.76).

20.
Electricity tariffs need to be increased and EAGB restructured into an efficient and
viable company. A tariff adjustment to at least cost recovery, together with a restructuring of the
company—assisted by the World Bank—should help protect scarce budgetary resources while
continuing to provide electricity. A World Bank study is underway to determine the current level of
electricity subsidies, with results expected by November 2015. Staff stressed that remaining
subsidized tariffs should be targeted to vulnerable households (MEFP ¶26).
21.
The fiscal anchor for the 2015 economic program is a strict limit on domestic bank
credit to the central government (effectively zero), making room for credit to the private
sector. The drawdown of deposits by CFA 4.4 billion (0.7 percent of GDP) reflects the advance
interest payment on Treasury bills in 2015 for 2016 (CFA 1.4 billion) and a large part of the payments
made in 2015 that were committed in 2014 (CFA 3 billion)6. This leaves a financing gap of
CFA 4.7 billion (0.8 percent of GDP), equivalent to the first two tranches of the ECF program. Staff
stressed that achieving this objective would require restoration of fiscal discipline to avoid any
accumulation of unpaid bills in 2015, and to buttress fiscal policy credibility. In this context, staff
underscored the usefulness of the weekly treasury committee meetings and the avoidance of extrabudgetary and improperly-documented spending (DNTs).
Authorities’ views
22.
The authorities concurred with the staff’s assessment of the importance of increasing
substantially government revenues, but would have preferred a stronger increase in
expenditures, in accordance to their Strategic Plan. They see success of the ongoing security
sector reforms as a prerequisite for socio-economic progress, as well as the success of their broader
reform agenda. They also stressed that restoring fiscal discipline through decisive PFM reforms and
expenditure controls is at the center of their policy priorities. However, the authorities also believe
that the current level of spending is below what the country needs in view of the daunting
infrastructure and social needs it faces. They hope this gap could be filled by a higher than expected
volume of external financing. Meanwhile, they aim to increase the efficiency of capital spending by
enhancing the capacity for project selection and execution.

In January and February 2015 the Government executed payments amounting to CFA 3.7 billion for payments
committed still in 2014 (including CFA 0.9 billon for the clearance of external arrears).

Box 4. Guinea-Bissau: New Fuel Pricing Mechanism
Guinea-Bissau introduced a semi-flexible fuel pricing mechanism in March 2015, which is overseen by
a committee on fuel pricing consisting of representatives from the Ministry of Energy, Ministry of Economy
and Finance, and fuel market operators. The committee recommends maximum sale prices per liter for the
various fuel products—petrol, diesel, kerosene, mixed fuel oil, and Fuel 380—and imposes import duties (at
10 percent), excise tax (15 percent), and sales tax (10 percent) on the landed cost per liter of products. A roaduser charge (4 percent) and a community levy (0.5 percent) are also levied. Petrol and diesel are subject to all
these taxes, while kerosene is subject to only the community tax and mixed fuel oil is subject to all but the
road-user tax and excise tax. The system helped the country stem recent global oil price increases.
As global fuel prices have weakened, the authorities have acted swiftly to partially transmit the gains
to the public while eliminating subsidies and remaining current on obligations to PetroMar:


The committee on fuel pricing maintained the semi-flexible pricing system.



Reflecting variations in global oil prices, the domestic ex-pump price of diesel fuel was reduced by
7.4 percent in February 2015 and re-increased by 2.2 percent in March 2015.



The initial reduction of fuel prices was lower than the reduction in international prices, which allowed
the elimination of fuel subsidies with an estimated savings of around CFA 270 million;



The government settled all arrears inherited from the previous government to PetroMar.

Maintaining the current fuel pricing mechanism put in place this March would avoid a recurrence of
subsidies and boost domestic revenues from fuel imports to an estimated CFA 9.5 billion (1.6 percent of
GDP or 10 percent of domestic revenues in 2015). Going forward, the Government will analyze further
improvements to the fuel pricing mechanism to ensure full pass-through of international prices to domestic
prices and to shield price movements from political interference.

C. Restoring Financial Stability
23.
Guinea-Bissau’s financial sector is shallow and faces diverse challenges that hamper its
effective support of growth (Box 5). The number of people with an account at a financial
institution has increased recently, owing to the government’s decision to pay salaries only through
the banking sector. However, Guinea-Bissau’s financial intermediation remains the lowest in the
WAEMU region, credit to the private sector remains lower than implied by the country’s
fundamentals, and the sector contributes only marginally to firms’ investment programs, with banks
preferring to invest in Treasury bills or deposit excess liquidity at the BCEAO as they perceive credit
risk in the private sector as very high.
Staff’s assessment
24.
Recent financial soundness indicators point to financial sector vulnerabilities but a
market-based solution to curb high levels non-performing loans (NPLs) and re-capitalize
those banks affected by them is underway (Table 7, SIP section III). As a result of the 2012–13
decline in international cashew prices, and fueled by political uncertainty, credit quality has declined
substantially. In particular, Guinea-Bissau’s NPLs increased substantially (from 6.5 percent as of end
December 2011 to 25.7 percent in June 2014), far above the average for the WAEMU despite lower
provisioning rates. Profitability remains low, with average rates of return on assets below 3 percent.
The banking sector remains overly exposed to the retail and wholesale trade, restaurants and hotels,

and other services, which together account for around 75 percent of total credit. However, those
banks which have been plagued by high NPLs have started to seize collateral and one bank agreed
with the WAEMU Banking Commission on a phased increase in capital from CFA 5 billion to 20
billion.
25.
Enforcing compliance with key prudential ratios would help safeguard financial
stability and requires action on both regional and national levels. Recent capacity building
efforts at the Banking Commission need to be reinforced by strengthening risk-based supervisory
tools and processes. Timely provision of data by the national BCEAO branch to the supervisory
authorities will be essential in this regard. A stronger corrective action framework should be put in
place in order to reduce regulatory forbearance and better enforce compliance with prudential
norms, including by taking timely and effective corrective measures against weak and/or
noncompliant banks. The move to Basel II/III standards will take time but offers an opportunity to
bring prudential rules closer to international norms. In the mean time, the regional authorities
should step up the enforcement of the current rules, as well as start tightening certain rules where
improvements are most pressing, for instance on concentration risk and provisioning of nonperforming loans, and increase banks’ capital adequacy levels, including through raising operating
banks’ minimum share capital to CFAF 10 billion by June 2016 as envisaged.
Authorities’ views
26.
The authorities shared the staff’s assessment of the need to develop the financial
sector, enhance access to credit, and reduce financial sector vulnerabilities. They intend to
revise the national strategy document for the microfinance sector by consolidating existing
initiatives and by signing a partnership agreement with the African Microfinance Network to boost
the development of microfinance in rural areas and credit facilities for small- and medium-sized
enterprises. They have adhered to recent recommendations of an MCM TA mission and shunned
public intervention to avoid fiscal costs and moral hazard.

D. Maintaining Prudent Borrowing Policies
27.
The debt sustainability analysis (DSA) indicates that Guinea-Bissau faces a moderate
risk of debt distress, based on an assessment of public external debt, but a heightened overall
risk of debt distress, reflecting the high level of total public debt. Under the baseline scenario,
all indicators are expected to remain under their indicative thresholds throughout the projection
period (2015–35). However, the present value (PV) of debt-to-exports breaches its threshold under
the most extreme shock scenario.7 Stress tests point to vulnerability to adverse shocks affecting key
macroeconomic variables. Finally, the current debt management hard and software has serious
shortcomings that need to be urgently addressed.

In the medium term, improvements in the business and legal
environment will be necessary to improve access to financial
services. The authorities need to address weak transparency,
underdeveloped judicial and business environments, limited
financial skills, and distortive taxation and suboptimal prudential
regimes and regulatory forbearance, which remain the main
obstacles to financial sector development. Lower collateral
requirements stemming from a better legal environment and
higher accounting standards could increase firms’ access to
financing and boost investment and GDP.

5

1988

Direct contact with financial infrastructure remains low but
mobile phone penetration could be a promising venue to
increase financial access. Recent numbers suggest that around
36 percent of the population possess at least one SIM card, and
two mobile payment providers currently operate in GuineaBissau, with equal market shares. In addition, the magnitude of
remittances in Guinea-Bissau suggests a substantial market for
cross-border mobile payments. The development of mobile
financial services could thus serve as a means to increase
financial inclusiveness for the unbanked population.

10

1986

Guinea-Bissau’s ratio of private sector credit to GDP is below
the level implied by its fundamentals; Following the
methodology Al Hussainy (2011) and Barajas et al. (2013), this
benchmark ratio is derived based on a number of structural
factors in a panel of over 120 emerging and developing countries
for the period from 1986 to 2013. For the case of Guinea-Bissau,
this benchmark level is much higher than the actual level of
private credit in percent of GDP, implying that financial depth is
lagging behind the level implied by the country’s structural
characteristics. A regression of the financial gap (actual private
sector credit-to-GDP minus its benchmark) on macroeconomic,
institutional and policy variables helps identify the drivers of the
deviations from the benchmark for 2004–13. While causality is
hard to establish in this empirical exercise and the effects
represent mostly associations, increasing trade openness, health
(social) spending, FDI inflows and improved infrastructure to the
top performing WAEMU country in the category could decrease
the financial gap by 4½, 3, 1¾, and 1¼ percentage points,
respectively.

Staff’s assessment
28.
Staff emphasized that the authorities should immediately address operational risk,
continue to implement prudent borrowing policies and strengthen debt management
capacity. In view of existing vulnerability, seeking grants and concessional loans for priority
infrastructure projects remains important for Guinea-Bissau. In addition, improving debt
management capacity is increasingly critical in light of the country’s likely access to a mix of
credit/lending offers following the promising results of the Brussels donor roundtable in March 2015.
In view of this, staff encouraged the authorities to leverage TA in debt management from the IMF
and other development partners to review the legal and institutional framework for public debt
management along with debt contracting procedures. As an immediate step, staff urged the
authorities to urgently repair their debt management soft and hardware.8 To contain the risk of debt
distress and support long-term debt sustainability, it will also be critical for the authorities to
strengthen debt management, maintain prudent borrowing policies, periodically produce reports on
external debt commitments, agreements and disbursements (structural benchmark), sustain fiscal
consolidation efforts, continue implementation of growth-enhancing structural reforms, and
promote economic diversification.
Authorities’ views
29.
The authorities broadly concurred with the staff’s views on debt sustainability and its
recommendations. They agreed that debt sustainability depends crucially on sound
macroeconomic policies that would in turn increase their chances of accessing concessional
financing. They maintained, however, that the pace of public investments would be determined on
the basis of available external concessional resources. Thus, some risks identified in this DSA would
not materialize if funding were not available. The authorities recognized the contributory role of
prudent debt management and implementation of structural reforms to improve the business
environment and to enhance overall growth and export prospects.

E. Enhancing Competitiveness and External Stability
Staff’s assessment
30.
While Guinea-Bissau’s real effective exchange rates appear broadly in line with
fundamentals, significant improvements to governance and the business environment are
necessary to safeguard external stability in the medium term (Box 6 and Figure 4). GuineaBissau has made significant progress in improving its business environment during 2005–11 but the
country’s relative rating in the Doing Business ranking has deteriorated compared to the last

AFRITAC WEST conducted a TA mission to Bissau in June 2015 to help the authorities assess the system of debt
data and related operational risks, examine the legal and institutional framework for public debt management, and
review the domestic and external debt contracting processes. The mission also developed a roadmap for further TA
in debt management.

assessment: only 10 out of 189 countries evaluated are currently ranked worse. While the emergency
plan to provide electricity has shown first results, further improvements in access to and reliable
electricity supply will be crucial. Starting a business and enforcing contracts are particularly
challenging areas compared to other WAEMU countries and a benchmark group of fast-growing
African economies. Guinea-Bissau’s institutions and policies are also consistently ranked weaker than
in other WAEMU countries in the Country Policy and Institutional Assessment. Going forward, major
investments to close the infrastructure gap, with a view to decrease high transportation and
communication costs, develop human capital, and improve governance will be critical to boost the
economy’s overall competitiveness.

Authorities’ views
31.
The authorities agreed with staff’s external stability assessment for Guinea-Bissau.
They acknowledged the need to further improve the business environment and diversify the
economy. They plan to design a strategy to promote the production and export of the main export
product, cashew nuts, while leveraging international support to improve the quality of institutions
and public delivery of health and education services.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

GUINEA-BISSAU

F. Fostering Inclusive Growth
Staff’s assessment
32.
Progress toward the Millennium Development Goals, particularly in health and
education has been sluggish, despite some satisfactory initial steps in addressing the infrastructure
gap and meeting the health and educational challenges. At the same time, reducing unemployment
and tackling income inequality continue to feature prominently among the government’s
developmental priorities. Hence, they have initiated an international audit of the ill-managed fund
for processing of agricultural products (FUNPI) with support from the World Bank. The results from
this audit (which are expected by end-September) would help define a new strategy to promote the
cashew nuts sector and to reduce rural poverty. In addition, the authorities are committed to the
three main pillars at the core of their request for donor support—(i) significantly increasing
investment in infrastructure; (ii) encouraging industrialization; and (iii) improving urban
development—to support inclusive growth.
33.
Maintaining a stable macroeconomic environment and improved quality in social
spending could help progress towards inclusive growth. The authorities plan to focus on
measures to improve access to education and health services, strengthen social protection,
empower women, and increase employment opportunities through economic diversification and
expansion of access of credit by small and medium size enterprises. They agreed that quick-wins in
the transformation process could emanate from a re-structuring or closure of the fund for
industrialization of agricultural products (FUNPI), which should create a level field for private sector
development and economic diversification, while helping reduce rural poverty.
34.
Structural reforms to address corruption and endemic rent-seeking should be pursued
to foster more inclusive growth. Initiatives taken by the authorities to implement an asset
disclosure regime are a welcome development. However, for these initiatives to be meaningful the
asset disclosure regime must focus on high-ranking public officials across the executive, legislative
and judiciary branches and the accuracy of the declarations must be adequately verified. For this
purpose, the entity responsible for verifying the accuracy of the declarations must be given sufficient
autonomy and resources to effectively conduct its functions. In addition, these efforts would be
completed by strengthening and effectively mobilizing the Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the
Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) framework, which could assist in detecting, prosecuting and
deterring corruption-related offenses and smuggling. In this context, although preliminary steps
have been taken to implement the existing AML/CFT framework, the legal framework must be swiftly
brought in line with the 2012 FATF standard and effectively implemented.

Box 6. External Stability Assessment
Based on the external balance assessment for developing and emerging markets (EBA-lite), Guinea-Bissau’s real
effective exchange rate (REER) appears to be broadly in line with the country’s fundamentals. However, the
economy remains exposed to shocks due to high export concentration and the country’s fragile status. The
business environment remains difficult.
The EBA-lite approach suggests that Guinea-Bissau’s REER would be broadly in line with its
fundamentals in 2015. To determine a possible REER misalignment, the EBA-lite methodology compares
Guinea-Bissau’s short-term current account balance to a

-3.6
-4
in 2015, the misalignment of the current account thus
amounts to -0.9 percent of GDP, implying a statistically insignificant overvaluation of the REER by 6.5 percent.
As a result, the REER appears broadly in line with Guinea-Bissau’s fundamentals.
However, Guinea-Bissau’s external position remains vulnerable to a range of risks. A stable political and
security situation is the necessary condition for a sustainable external position. From the macroeconomic
perspective, Guinea-Bissau’s very high export concentration in cashew nuts poses the main risk to external
stability as it leaves the country vulnerable to international price fluctuations. An increase in currently favorable
oil prices could exert pressure on the current account as the economy is highly dependent on the import of
petroleum products. In the medium term, continued flows of grants and access to concessional loans will be
necessary to finance huge infrastructure development needs which in turn are the precondition for GuineaBissau’s export base to develop.

Authorities’ views
35.
The authorities concurred with staff’s analysis and policy recommendations on
inclusive growth. They explained that addressing infrastructure gaps in energy, telecommunication,
and water supply are key priorities. In addition, strengthening public institutions is critical, to lay the
foundation for a business environment conducive to private sector development, economic growth
and job creation. They maintained that progress on the security sector reform would provide a
necessary pre-condition for progress in their planned economic and structural transformation of the
country, and that it is a cost that the country has to pay to maintain peace and political stability.

G. Other Surveillance Issues
36.
Data provision and quality. Weaknesses in the national accounts, government finance
statistics, balance of payments statistics and debt statistics continue to hamper surveillance. In
particular, estimates of growth and exports of cashew nut continue to be weak and needs to be
addressed through institutional strengthening, a new production inventory and regular production

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

21

GUINEA-BISSAU

surveys (MEFP ¶28). Support from the IMF and development partners should help improve the
quality and enhance the timeliness of data for surveillance and program monitoring.
37.
Safeguards assessment. The BCEAO is the common central bank of the countries of the
West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU). The latest safeguards assessment of the
BCEAO of December 13, 2013 found that the bank continued to have a strong control environment
and has enhanced its governance framework, including the establishment of an audit committee to
oversee the audit and financial reporting processes. The assessment also identified some limitations
in the external audit process and recommended the selection of a second experienced audit firm to
conduct joint audits to ensure the adequacy of this mechanism, the implementation of International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) (now envisaged for end-2015) and the strengthening of audit
committee oversight.
38.
Exchange System and Exchange Rate Arrangement. Guinea-Bissau accepted the
obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 with effect from January 1, 1997. It joined the WAEMU
in 1997, and has no separate legal tender. The exchange system is free of multiple currency practices
and exchange restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international
transactions.

PROGRAM MODALITIES AND ACCESS
39.
It is proposed that Guinea-Bissau’s program be supported by an arrangement under
the IMF’s ECF. The authorities’ economic program aims to place the country on a virtuous path of
sustainable and inclusive growth, while enhancing social equity, transparency and efficiency of
public institutions (MEFP ¶2). Staff proposes an access level equivalent to 120 percent of quota
(SDR 17.04 million), with a slight front-loaded disbursement of 20 percent of quota for each of the
first two disbursements as one-off revenues in 2015 remain uncertain and Ebola-prevention remains
underfunded. This access level and its phasing will also support the authorities’ economic program,
and help finance the country’s protracted balance of payments needs and achieve its poverty
reduction objectives. The access level is based on staff’s assessment of Guinea-Bissau’s outlook, the
projected external financing requirement of about US$24 million during the program period, the
strength of the envisaged policy adjustments, and the government’s solid track record of policy
implementation in PFM and strengthening institutions over the past nine months. It is in line with
the ECF norm for countries with outstanding Fund credit of less than 100 percent of quota. By the
end of the proposed program, total Fund credit would stand at about 170 percent of quota (Table
5).
40.
Guinea-Bissau’s capacity to repay the Fund is adequate. Debt service to the Fund is low
and is projected to increase from 0.5 percent of exports of goods and services in 2016 to 0.9 percent
in 2018 (Table 5). The DSA indicates that the risk of debt distress would remain moderate. In
addition, Guinea-Bissau has a good track-record of timely payments of debt obligations to the Fund.
The government is making best efforts to conclude rescheduling agreements with its official bilateral
creditors (Paris Club and non-Paris Club) to whom it has arrears, and has a credible plan and

22

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

GUINEA-BISSAU

projected financing in place to eliminate the arrears with the International Fund for Agricultural
Development (IFAD), a multilateral creditor. This includes efforts to formalize agreements with Brazil,
Russia, and Angola and to initiate negotiations with UAE, Libya, Pakistan, and Taiwan Province of
China, and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD). The government is also
making good-faith efforts to reach a collaborative agreement with the Franco-Portuguese bank, a
private creditor with whom it is in arrears (MEFP ¶16). It has cleared all external arrears with other
creditors and is current on its remaining external debt obligations.
41.
Program performance will be assessed through semi-annual reviews, based on
quantitative performance criteria and indicative targets (Table 8), structural benchmarks for the first
year of the program and beyond to June 2016 (Table 9). The performance criteria for the first and
the second reviews would be set for June 30 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The performance
criteria will include (i) a floor on total domestic revenue; (ii) a ceiling on net domestic bank credit to
the central government; (iii) a zero-ceiling on non-concessional external debt; (iii) a zero-ceiling on
the stock of external debt owed or guaranteed by the central government with maturities of less
than one year; and (iv) a zero-ceiling on external payment arrears.
42.
Program implementation is subject to downside risks. Key risks to the macroeconomic
outlook discussed above would also affect program performance. In addition, the authorities’ ability
to maintain fiscal discipline and break away from past practices in budget execution and to enhance
debt management will be critical.

STAFF APPRAISAL
43.
After peaceful elections and impressive early progress on structural reforms, the new
government has a historic window of opportunity to escape fragility. The government benefits
from wide support, including from the opposition parties, and traditional donors have returned in
support of Guinea-Bissau. The government’s Strategic Plan (2014–18) and the 2014 and 2015
budgets were approved in Parliament unanimously. Further evidence of the confidence in the
government and the country was exhibited at the donor roundtable conference held in Brussels on
March 25, 2015, where development partners committed some US$1.5 billion for the financing of
the country’s development agenda. The medium-term outlook is positive with continued strong
growth and robust external position. Staff encourages the authorities to move steadfastly with the
security sector reform and develop a sustainable pension scheme for affected security officers.
44.
To enhance fiscal policy credibility and support macroeconomic stability staff urges
the authorities to strengthen fiscal discipline and improve the efficiency of public spending.
Staff welcomes the authorities’ efforts to boost revenue mobilization and create fiscal space for
priority spending, and encourages them to increase the efficiency of public spending, and to
broaden the tax base to reach the revenue targets under the program. Staff urges the authorities to
strengthen budget execution procedures, particularly commitment monitoring and capital spending
management in the context of their medium-term PFM reform strategy. PFM reforms planned for
the medium term are appropriately ambitious, given existing administrative capacity constraints, but

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

23

GUINEA-BISSAU

are necessary for fiscal sustainability. Staff also stresses the urgency to reform the Water and
Electricity Company EAGB both by restructuring the company and by increasing electricity tariffs.
The current tariff structure provides subsidies to all consumers indiscriminately, which is costly to the
budget and leads to an inefficient allocation of resources.
45.
Staff urges the authorities to improve the production of key macroeconomic data
which currently hamper effective surveillance. Staff encourages the authorities to improve the
coordination among various institutions and ensure that adequate resources are allocated for the
production of statistical data, including staffing, equipment, and training. Staff puts particular
emphasis on the statistics of cashew nut production and export and urges the authorities to entrust
an institution, like the Ministry of Agriculture, that has the required capacities and knowhow, with
this task.
46.
Staff welcomes the government’s decision to audit the hitherto ill-managed cashew
fund, the FUNPI, and strongly urges the authorities to move steadfastly to restructure or
eliminate the fund. The restructuring or elimination of the FUNPI would help reduce poverty, as it
has adverse redistributive effects on income, and would improve the business environment. Staff
urges the authorities to use international best practice in the planned audit of the FUNPI, and to
move expeditiously to restructure or eliminate the fund based on findings from the audit.
47.
It will be important to restore financial sector stability. Staff commends the authorities
for handling banking sector problems by following international best practice. It has sent a strong
signal for the need of contract enforcement, avoiding moral hazard and safeguarding scarce public
resources. Staff urges the authorities to closely monitor the banks’ commitments to recapitalize and
to liquidate seized collateral.
48.
Staff urges the authorities to seek financing on grant or highly concessional terms,
which staff considers essential in light of the large public investment plans and the vulnerable debt
outlook to revenue and export shocks
49.
Staff supports the authorities request for a three-year arrangement under the ECF,
with an access level of 120 percent of quota. The new program will help the authorities enhance
macroeconomic stability and growth prospects. The program is appropriately ambitious, particularly
in the fiscal reform area. This, combined with Guinea-Bissau’s balance of payments needs, its low
outstanding credit from the Fund, and its adequate capacity to discharge external debt obligations,
justifies the proposed access level.
50.
Staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation with Guinea-Bissau takes place
within 24 months, subject to the Decision on consultation cycles for program countries.9

One-off revenues amounted to 0.9 percent of GDP in 2014 (due to FUNPI's proceeds being transferred to the Treasury) and are expected to account for 0.5 percent of GDP in 2015 (due to the
selling of 3G licenses) and 1.6 percent of GDP in 2016 (mostly due to revenue from the selling of seized illegal wood and the collection of associated taxes).

Appendix I. Letter of Intent
Bissau, Guinea-Bissau
June 20, 2015
Ms Christine Lagarde,
Managing Director,
International Monetary Fund,
Washington, D.C. 20431
USA
Dear Managing Director,
1.
After holding transparent and fair elections––with the help of the international community––
we took office in mid-2014 and found the country in a critical situation. Our institutions, already
weak before the military coup, had deteriorated even further. Arrears on salaries and foreign debt
accumulated, shortage of electricity became chronic, and the State’s capacity to provide public
goods became virtually non-existent. Notwithstanding these seemingly insurmountable challenges,
our commitment and determination to break with the past of chronic political instability has been
resolute and we have started to place our country on the path of sustainable and inclusive growth.
2.
After almost one year in office, we are encouraged by the initial positive results and are as
resolutely committed to embark on the next phase of reforms. The emergency measures adopted
helped the government to regain control over the economy, bringing renewed hope and a smile
back to the faces of the people of Guinea-Bissau. The results of policies adopted with support from
the Rapid Credit Facility disbursement were satisfactory. We now request from the IMF an Enhanced
Credit Facility (ECF) arrangement in support of our program of economic and financial reforms. We
are confident that this is a critical point in the history of our country: a break with a past of chronic
political instability and despair, and a move towards sustained and inclusive development. Our
ultimate objective is to move the country onto a virtuous cycle of progress by 2025. There is broadbased consensus, therefore, to maintain macroeconomic stability, implement needed reforms to
promote better governance to support public sector efficiency and enhance private sector
development and job creation.
3.
The attached Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) lays out the policies
the government plans to adopt over the next three years. The government of Guinea-Bissau is
convinced that the policies and measures contained in this MEFP will constitute the solid foundation
the country needs to solve difficulties in its balance of payments and to face the challenges related
to growth and poverty reduction. In support of our economic program, the Government of GuineaBissau requests a 36-month arrangement under Extended Credit Facility of the International
Monetary Fund in an amount equivalent to SDR 17.04 million, or 120 percent of Guinea-Bissau’s
quota. The ECF arrangement will provide needed financing during the program period and signal
our determination to implement sound policies, catalyze additional financing and technical

38

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

GUINEA-BISSAU

assistance from our development partners, and boosts investor and business confidence. Progress in
implementation of our program will be assessed through semi-annual reviews, quantitative
performance criteria, indicative targets, and agreed structural benchmarks as described in the
attached memorandum.
4.
We believe that the policies set forth in the attached MEFP are adequate to meet the
objectives of the program, but we stand ready to undertake any further measures as may become
appropriate as circumstances change. The government will consult the IMF staff, on its own initiative
or at your request, before adopting any such measures, and in advance of any revisions to the
policies contained in the MEFP. The government agrees to fully cooperate with the IMF to achieve
policy aims and avoid introducing policies or measures that might increase the balance of payment
difficulties faced by Guinea-Bissau. We will also provide timely information necessary for monitoring
economic developments and the implementation of policies defined in the program, as agreed
under the attached Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU), or upon request.
5.
The government of Guinea-Bissau agrees to the publication of this Letter of Intent, together
with the attached MEFP and the TMU, as well as of the Article IV Staff Report related to the
disbursement request under the ECF and the Debt Sustainability Analysis.

Yours sincerely,
/s/

GUINEA-BISSAU

Attachment I. Memorandum on Economic and Financial Policies
June 20, 2015
Context
1.
Following two very difficult, troubled years in the economic, social and political
spheres after the coup d’état of April 2012, Guinea-Bissau returned to a period of hope and
self-assertion. The new government immediately took measures to normalize its operations and
discussed with its stakeholders a strategy to put the country back on a path of sustainable and
inclusive growth. The government benefited from a disbursement under the Rapid Credit Facility
(RCF) from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) which contributed towards catalyzing urgently
needed resources from international partners. Performance relative to the policies supported by the
RCF exceeded expectations in several areas, particularly with regard to mobilising domestic revenue.
2.
The government’s reform and development plans are ambitious and the challenges are
enormous but so are the commitment and the will of the government to place the country on
the path of sustainable and inclusive growth, social equity, transparency and effective
institutions. After 18 actual, attempted or alleged military coups since independence, the new
government that took office in July 2014 aims to subject the military to public finance management
procedures applied in other sectors of the government. The initiated security sector reform also
demonstrates that the government wishes to break with a past of instability and poor governance.
The government’s vision of the future that received an encouraging endorsement by the donor
community at the Brussels roundtable in March 2015 has the following three main pillars
(i) significantly increasing investment in infrastructures, (ii) encouraging industrialisation and
(iii) improving urban development.

A. Recent Economic Developments and Performance under RCF-Supported
Policies
3.
Economic activity recovered in 2014, and prices remained stable. After the economy
contracted 1.8 percent in 2012 and virtually stagnated in 2013, economic activity remained weak
during the first half of 2014, when it was negatively impacted by delays in civil servants’ salary
payments, constant cuts in the water and power supplies and high macroeconomic uncertainty.
Timely measures taken by the new government, higher cashew prices, and an uptick in construction
and telecommunications helped drive the economy during the second half of the year. Clearance of
four months of salary arrears and income from higher cashew proceeds increased domestic demand
resulted in an estimated 2.5 percent growth in 2014. This rather modest recovery of economic
activity and a weak credit market contributed towards keeping inflation stable (-0.1 percent) in 2014.
4.
The return to normal institutional activity and strong government commitment to
reform led to a return of donor support. Peaceful elections were successfully held, and an
inclusive government, strongly committed to adopting the reforms the country need was formed.
This made it possible to rapidly benefit from an RCF disbursement from the IMF, restore the

40

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

GUINEA-BISSAU

financial compensation agreement for fisheries with the EU and receive budget support from
international partners, thus alleviating the tight fiscal situation.
5.
Initial results of the measures adopted by the new government with the support of the
RCF disbursement exceeded expectations. First measures to limit the use of fuel subsidies,
improve compliance by large taxpayers, and step up custom controls to reduce fraud and underinvoicing resulted in a considerable increase in tax revenue. Tax revenue (DGCI) increased by
45 percent in the last quarter of 2014 year-on-year, while customs revenue (DGA) leaped by
145 percent over the same period, implying growth rates of 10 and 39 percent, respectively, and
increasing tax pressure by 3.9 percentage points to 12.0 percent of GDP in 2014. Non-tax revenue
almost tripled due to the resumption of fishing compensation payments and the transfer of funds
collected by FUNPI to the budget. The government re-instated electricity supply by contracting a
private company to install thermal generators that added 10MW to the Bissau grid. The government
also laid off more than 200 interns who had been hired to the tax authority without following
appropriate procedures and without the necessary qualifications.
6.
Increased revenue and the re-establishing of international financial flows allowed the
government to start settling a number of arrears. The long transition period caused considerable
loss of fiscal control, resulting in arrears amounting to CFA 17,857 billion. Improvement in the fiscal
situation––including the issuance of T-Bills amounting to CFA 15 billion––helped the government to
start clearing arrears. Currently almost all salary arrears from 2013 and 2014 and all external arrears
have been cleared.1 In addition, the government is paying and renegotiating debts to state owned
enterprises.2
7.
Apart from expected higher international cashew prices in 2015, the economy will also
benefit from the government’s decision to suspend the FUNPI collections this year. Recent
evidence suggests a negative effect of the FUNPI levy on poverty. The lack of a positive impact of
the FUNPI receipts on the sector prompted the government to call for a full audit to be concluded
by July 2014 of the FUNPI and its beneficiaries. Together with the higher cashew prices, the
suspension of the FUNPI levy will increase income of cashew producers. This will significantly reduce
poverty, as 100,000 cashew producers support an estimated 800,000 people 70 percent of which live
below the poverty line. The suspension of FUNPI will likely reduce the amount of cashew nuts
smuggled into neighbouring countries,

There remains a small amount of arrears related to teachers’ bonuses carried over from 2013 as well as payments of
arrears to embassies.

2

The government rescheduled a debt with Ecobank in the amount of CFA 6 billion from 2013, contracted by GuineaBissau Electricity and Water Company (EAGB), to be fully repaid by 2017. At the same time, Petromar––the fuel
importing company––has been paying off a debt of approximately CFA 2 billion contracted by the military, through
withholding tax due to the government. This debt is expected to be cleared in 2015. The European Investment Bank
is demanding payment of an old debt of 2 million euros from Guiné Telecom from when it was still a 100 percent
state owned company which the government intends to repay with the receipts from the planned privatization of
the company.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

8.
The current account deficit narrowed to an estimated 1.2 percent of GDP in 2014 and
is expected to remain stable in 2015. The 2014 improvement in the current account balance
reflected the recovery of international cashew prices, a modest increase in cashew volume exported,
and a large inflow of budgetary assistance of CFA 23 billion. Both cashew nut prices and export
volumes are expected to increase in 2015. Improved terms of trade from low oil prices and higher
cashew prices would cause the current account balance to remain relatively steady in 2015, despite
high import demand driven by stronger GDP growth and import-intensive capital investments.
9.
The banking sector is strengthening with the enforcement of non-performing loan
(NPL) provisioning and capital injections. In line with IMF advice and international best practice,
banks affected by the 2012 and 2013 decline in cashew nut prices have started provisioning for NPLs
in line with regional regulation, seize collateral, and one bank decided on a phased increase of its
capital subscription over the next two years as agreed with the regional banking commission.
Seizing and liquidating collateral should significantly improve lending conditions as it demonstrates
the banks’ ability to enforce contracts. The total banking system’s NPLs stood at 29.2 percent of
gross loans at the end of December 2014. To remedy weak contract enforcement the Government is
now also promoting leasing as a less risky credit instruments. To this end, a contract was signed
end-April with the International Finance Corporation (IFC). As part of its commitments, the IFC will
assist the government in the adoption of a legislation and institutional framework for leasing
operations as well as in the building of capacity of technical partners to promote access to finance
for SMEs and smaller businesses. It will also provide advisory services to stakeholders.

B. Policies for 2015 and the Medium Term
Overall strategy
10.
The government’s fiscal policy aims at increasing revenues to help finance key public
services and narrow the infrastructure gap to reduce poverty and support sustained and
inclusive growth. The government envisages implementing the 2015 budget as approved by
Parliament in December 2014. If revenues exceed budgeted resources, the government intends to
allocate the additional resources to non-salary priority spending, including in the social sectors and
to the procurement of equipment for strengthening tax and customs administration. The
Government also intends to submit to Parliament in 2015 the 2016 budget with a spending
envelope that reflects available resources without recourse to the banking sector.
11.
To properly monitor key macroeconomic variables, including performance indicators
under the ECF, coordinate technical assistance and monitor progress in implementation of
reforms, the government will staff its reform unit and provide it with the necessary means.
This reform unit periodically reports to the Minister of Finance progress in achieving agreed
performance indicators and development objectives. It will also keep updated lists of all its partners,
prioritize technical assistance and agree with partners on the division of labor in technical assistance.
Finally, it will ensure the information sharing, including TA reports, with partners involved in the
same area in order to avoid conflicting and overlapping advice.

12.
Following successful implementation of the emergency program, the government
received pledges of US$1.5 billion from international partners at the recent round table to
finance its medium-term development strategy (2015–25). The three main objectives of the
strategy are to substantially increase investment in infrastructure, encourage industrialization and
promote urban development. This would help to diversify the economy in the four key sectors––
agriculture and agro-industry, fishery, tourism and mining.
13.
The Government Development Program (2014–18) includes several measures to build
sufficient energy supply to break from a chronic shortage of power. Around 28MW of energy
shall be added to the national grid from the Kaléta and Sambangalou international hydro-electric
power stations that Guinea-Bissau shares with Senegal, Guinea-Conakry and The Gambia through
the OMVG energy project, with the first power station to be completed this year and the second
one, once started, to be completed within 40 months. Further investments would cover instalments
of low and medium voltage power lines, including building a 30km transmission network around
Bissau as well as installing 219km of high voltage power lines, as part of the 1,760km of the OMVG
project.
14.
The poor state and limited size of the country’s road network constrains private sector
development and therefore requires massive investments. The government’s investment
strategy includes the re-construction of the Farim bridge and rehabilitation of the Buba-Catio road
at an estimated cost of 276 billion FCFA by 2018.

Measures to Improve Fiscal Management
15.
The government commits to clear all outstanding domestic arrears and to avoid
accumulating new domestic or external arrears. It will pay the remaining stock of almost
CFA 0.5 billion for teachers’ bonuses and CFA 2.4 billion to embassies by the end of 2015.
Furthermore, the government intends to clear any remaining domestic arrears3 using the following
strategy: (i) determine the true amount of any outstanding arrears through further auditing and
verifications by mid-2016,4 (ii) verify full tax compliance of all creditors by mid-2016 (with USfinanced technical assistance), (iii) determine net government arrears after correcting for any tax
obligations, and (iv) establish a repayment schedule for these arrears over a time period of five to
seven years, included in the respective state budgets. The government intends to start clearance of
these arrears in 2016 with an amount of CFA 3 billion and issue treasury bonds with maturities
ranging from one to six years to cover the remaining balance.

3

There are three types of domestic arrears (i) accumulated between 1974 and 1999 which have been audited,
partially recognized and settled, (ii) accumulated between 2000 and 2007 which have been audited but for some of
which validity remains doubtful, and (iii) accumulated between 2008 and 2012, including government backed
guarantees, which have not been audited, yet.

4

In this process, the government also intends to assess the level of outstanding membership fees to international
institutions and define a strategy regarding membership cancellation, rescheduling and/or settling of obligation.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

16.
The government remains committed to reach rescheduling or debt relief agreements
with Paris Club and non-Paris Club creditors. This includes efforts to formalize agreements with
Brazil, Russia, and Angola and to initiate negotiations with the UAE, Libya, Pakistan and Taiwan,
Province of China, and the International Fund for Agriculture Development (IFAD). The government
is making best efforts to conclude rescheduling agreements with our official bilateral creditors (Paris
Club and non-Paris Club) to whom it has arrears, and has a credible plan and projected financing in
place to eliminate the arrears with the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), a
multilateral creditor. The government is also making good faith efforts to reach a collaborative
agreement with the Franco-Portuguese bank, a private creditor with whom it is in arrears.
17.
The government will overhaul its currently weak debt management. The immediate
priority (by July 2015) consists of re-installing and operationalizing the debt management IT system
(DMFAS) and updating its debt database with any current and future debt obligations. The
government further intends to elevate the current debt unit to the level of a directorate with more
capacities and autonomy. It will seek long-term technical assistance from international partners to
improve its capacity for debt recording, monitoring and overall debt management. In addition, in
December 2015, it will start publishing quarterly reports on external debt commitments, agreements
and disbursement with a lag of three months.
18.
The government will carefully plan new investments and contract future debt only on
highly concessional terms. To ensure that the risk of debt stress remains manageable, the
government will carefully rank investments based on cost-benefit analysis, including social
considerations, and its impact on macroeconomic stability. To avoid high interest payments in a
situation of scarce government resources and weak debt management capacity, the government is
also committed not to rely on non-concessional loans. In December 2014, the Government started
quarterly meetings with all Project Implementation Units (PIUs) to take stock of the rate of project
implementation and discuss challenges ahead. To further enhance coordination, the government will
prepare, starting in December 2015 for September 2015, quarterly reports on PIP execution. In the
medium term, the government will design a three-year PIP, fully integrated with the medium-term
expenditure framework. For highly profitable projects where resources can be ring-fenced, the
government could, after consultation and agreement with IMF staff, consider non-concessional
borrowing.
19.
To improve treasury management, transparency and budgetary controls, the
government plans to take steps towards the creation of a Treasury Single Account (TSA). The
government intends to merge the bank accounts of line ministries and other public bodies into a
Treasury Single Account. To this end, by March 2016, the government will make an inventory of all
revenue sources and government accounts and require beneficiaries to collect revenues exclusively
through the banking system and to periodically report all their revenues to the Treasury. In a second
step, the Ministry of Finance will consider releasing budgetary resources only to beneficiaries who
comply with their reporting requirement.
20.
The treasury committee will be strengthened and inter-ministerial communication will
be improved. At the end of 2014, the government reintroduced the operational treasury committee
44

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

GUINEA-BISSAU

and, this year, the high-level treasury committee, with strategic and monitoring functions. Both are
essential for sound public financial management and should become an integral part of the budget
implementation process, especially under tight budgetary conditions. The technical treasury
committee will meet weekly to compile due payments, including scheduled debt payment, verify
their budgetary justification, assess recent revenue outcomes against targets and plan payments in
line with available resources. The Minister of Finance amended the terms of reference of the treasury
committee to henceforth also include the head of the debt unit. The treasury committee will
prepare, no later than by July 2015, a monthly rolling treasury cash flow projection table consistent
with the 2015 budget. International partners have already committed technical assistance to support
these efforts. The treasury committee secretariat prepares a set of supporting tables that help
structure the functioning of the committee. Information on external debt service will be shared
across all departments involved in the budgetary process on a timely and continued basis.
21.
The government is committed to minimizing the use of irregular and improperly
documented expenditure (DNTs) to emergency cases. The government will issue a cabinet
decree, laying out which types of expenditure may justify irregular expenditure. To minimize DNTs
the government has issued an order to reduce the number of stages in the expenditure process.
Also, ministers are no longer authorized to make expenditure commitments, unless previously
approved by the treasury committee.
22.
To reduce the number of ghost workers and to better manage the wage bill, the
Government plans to consolidate the financial module of the payroll system––under the
Ministry of Economy and Finance––with the administrative module, under the Ministry of
Public Administration. Currently, all civil servants are on the financial model of the payroll (folha
única), which includes not only salaries but also all allowances. However, the link between the
payment of salaries and the human resource management is still deficient. Furthermore, payments
of salaries through the banking system will now be extended to all civil servants, including for
salaries below CFA 50,000 and all military personnel by September 2015.
Revenue measures
23.
The government will continue to implement, enlarge and deepen reforms introduced
to improve tax collection. The tax authority would: (i) increase controls and inspections of large
and medium size companies; (ii) increase tax audits and controls and encourage the payment of
taxes by non-compliant taxpayers, including for the port, APGB and airport authority; (iii) increase
core functions in tax administration (register, tax returns, payments, taxpayer services, dispute
resolution); and (iv) broaden the taxpayer base. Important structural reforms of DGCI and DGA
include:



Setting up a professional auditing career structure, and with the help of technical
assistance complete by July 2015 the hiring of 100 competent tax officials through a
competitive hiring process



Develop with the help of technical assistance and adopt by end of 2015 a detailed
strategy for improving infrastructure and working conditions of officials of the

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

45

GUINEA-BISSAU

domestic tax and customs administrations. This strategy should include an investment
plan with cost estimates. In addition to the recently constructed building adjacent to the
current headquarters of the DGCI, which it will furbish and equip with appropriate office
supplies and computers by July 2015, it will also be necessary to construct or rehabilitate
buildings of the regional and local tax offices and to provide staff with vehicles to carry their
on-sight controls.



Streamline the tax system to ease payment of taxes, reduce distortions and improve
tax collection. To this end, the Government intends to
(i)

Set up a committee to propose changes to the tax code and organize a tax
conference by the year-end to discuss options for reforms with stakeholders,

(ii)

Implement a number of initiatives to facilitate tax payments, such as the recently
created one-stop office for cashew export, which includes the Ministry of Commerce,
customs and tax officials, and where exporters can register exports and declare and
pay taxes.

(iii)

With the help of technical assistance, streamline tax declarations and tax payment
procedures.

(iv)

Carry out a far-reaching survey to identify and quantify all non-tax and tax levies,
and charges not collected by the treasury. Public accountants will be appointed to
check and advise on non-tax revenues of each ministry.



Implement an intra-trade post in SAFIM to reconcile invoice merchandise volumes
with actual contents of the cargo (structural benchmark). Anti-fraud and under-invoicing
controls will be stepped up, reconciling quantities declared with those actually leaving
customs. Government will increasingly use scanners. These measures would facilitate
reconciling trade (export and import) volumes with taxes paid and increase the collaboration
between DGCI and customs DGA authorities. In the medium term, the government will also
introduce a one-stop window for import clearance.



To improve voluntary compliance and raise tax revenue, implement a universal tax
payer identification number (TIN) as part of a new small taxpayer regime by December
2015 (structural benchmark).



Electronically connect the tax authority headquarters with its regional and local tax
offices using the new IT system SIGF.



Over the medium term, the government will extend the customs IT system
SYDONIA++ to remaining border posts.



To improve and strengthen the monitoring system of payments of customs duties, the
Ministry of Finance will assess the efficiency of SGS, Bissau-Link and other companies
that provide services to customs.

24.
The government plans to continue to restrict tax exemptions and fine-tune subsidies.
To avoid unjustified tax exemptions and their abuse, the government will

46

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

GUINEA-BISSAU

(i)

Identify and quantify the value of subsidies and tax exemptions, assess their impact
on the poor, and transparently account for them in the budget,

(ii)

Produce, with the help of technical assistance, by June 2016, a comprehensive
study/analysis of the current mechanism of fuel pricing and subsidies and design an
automatic fuel price mechanism to ensure international price pass-through and
reduce the burden of the budget.

Other Measures
25.
In the context of the security sector reform, the government intends to retire the first
group of 500 soldiers by the end of 2015, and the design of the wider social security sector
reform is ongoing. To this end, the government issued a decree creating a special pension fund
with an estimated cost of US$82 million over the next five years, the time period within which a total
of 2500 military personnel will be gradually retired. For this fund, the government has received
commitments from ECOWAS amounting to US$46 million, US$1 million from Timor-Leste, and
US$1.2 from the UN peace building fund and is following up on other pledges received at the
Brussels round table. To contribute to its financial viability, the government will start transferring
budgetary resources into the fund amounting to the salary equivalent of retired personnel. In
addition, with the help of IMF technical assistance, the government will conduct an actuarial study of
the special pension fund as well as the pension fund for civil servants (under which soldiers not
qualifying for the special pension fund will fall) with a view to designing a sustainable social security
system. The government will also continue discussions with partners on the implementation of the
wider security sector reform for which ECOWAS committed an additional US$17 million and for
which discussions on the content and support with other partners are ongoing.
26.
The government wants to restructure the electricity and water company (EAGB) into a
profitable, financially healthy enterprise, and privatize Guiné Telecom. The government will
make EAGB an operationally viable company capable of self-financing its maintenance and
investment. Transfers from the government to EAGB in 2015 are very costly to the state budget. To
safeguard the state budget, while keeping social tariffs for the most vulnerable the government
intends to align the company’s tariff structures—last adjusted in 1997—to allow for maintenance
cost and amortization, and improve operational efficiency. In line with a study conducted by the
World Bank, the government intends to increase tariffs by December 2015 for regular customers to
achieve at least cost recovery, while increasing social tariffs by 5 percent. The government will also
prepare an audit plan by March 2016 for all SOEs and autonomous funds (structural benchmark).
The government also intends to privatize Guiné Telecom by end-2016.
27.
With a view to improving cashew nut production and trade, the government will
complete an international and comprehensive audit of the Fund for Industrialization of
Agricultural Products (FUNPI). This audit will be completed by end September 2015 and include
all its beneficiaries. The government will publish the results of the audit. These results will serve as
the basis for a new strategy, to be designed by June 2016, to promote cashew nut production and

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

47

GUINEA-BISSAU

transformation. The government considers eliminating the FUNPI. At minimum, the FUNPI will
remain inactive in the meantime.
28.
The government will improve compilation of statistics. The government will improve the
coordination among various institutions and ensure that adequate resources are allocated for the
production of statistical data, including staffing, equipment, and training. For the national accounts,
the government will start to hold regular meetings between BCEAO, ANCA, Customs, the Ministry of
Trade and INE to reconcile official statistics. Furthermore, the government will reach out to partners
to support a cashew nut production inventory, following which it will conduct annual cashew
production surveys to estimate the contribution of the sector to economic growth. The government
will decide which institution will take the lead responsibility in compiling raw data for cashew
production. Finally, to strengthen the medium-term expenditure framework and enhance efficiency
of public investments, the government will migrate to the new TOFE based on GFSM2001 and the
TOFE 2009 directive.
29.
To mitigate risks of organized crime and corruption, the government will continue to
improve its AML/CFT framework. To this end, (i) a national strategy on AML/CFT, consistent with
the FATF (Financial Action Taskforce on Money Laundering) standards and drafted with technical
assistance by GIABA, will be submitted to parliament by the end of the year; (ii) high ranking
government officials will be obliged to disclose their assets to the Secretary General of the
Presidency of the Council of Ministers by September 2015; (iii) the financial intelligence unit
(CENTIF-GB) will continue awareness raising activities to commercial banks and the general public
on the importance of and compliance with AML/CFT measures; and (iv) and CENTIF will conduct
training of border posts personnel to implement the new border declaration forms by June 2015.

Program Monitoring
30.
The government intends to take all the necessary measures agreed in the context of the
ECF-supported program. The program will be subject to semiannual reviews and semiannual
performance criteria, indicative targets and structural benchmarks, as set out in Tables 1 and 2 of
this Memorandum and in the attached Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU). In the first
year of the ECF-arrangement two semiannual reviews are scheduled, the first will be based on PCs at
end-June 2015 and completed on or after October 15, 2015, and the second review will be based on
PCs at end-December 2015 and completed on or after April 15, 2016. To facilitate program
monitoring, we are committed to providing detailed statistical information as specified in the TMU,
which also defines the scope and frequency of data to be reported for program monitoring
purposes.

Attachment II. Technical Memorandum of Understanding
Bissau, Guinea-Bissau, June 24, 2015

INTRODUCTION
1.
This memorandum sets out the understandings between the Bissau-Guinean authorities
and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) regarding the definitions of the quantitative
performance criteria (PCs) and structural benchmarks (SBs) for the program supported by the
Extended Credit Facility (ECF) arrangement, as well as the related reporting requirements. Unless
otherwise specified, all quantitative PCs and indicative targets will be evaluated in terms of
cumulative flows from the beginning of the period, as specified in Table 1 of the Memorandum
of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP).
2.
Program exchange rates.1 For the purpose of the program, foreign currency
denominated values for 2015 will be converted into local currency (CFA francs) using a program
exchange rate of CFA 532.3/US$ and cross rates as of end December 2014.

QUANTITATIVE PERFORMANCE CRITERIA
A. Floor on Total Domestic Tax Revenue
3.
Definition. Tax revenue is defined to include direct and indirect taxes as presented in the
central government financial operations table, as well as programmed recovery of tax arrears.
4.
Adjustment clauses. The floor on the total domestic tax revenue will be adjusted
downwards (upwards) by the amount of any shortfall (excess) in programmed recovery of tax
arrears.

B. Net Domestic Bank Credit to the Central Government (NCG)
5.
Definition. NCG refers to the net banking system’s claims on the central Government as
calculated by the Treasury Department. It is defined as follows:
a. the net position of the Government with the national BCEAO, including: treasury bills
and bonds; less (a) central Government deposits (excluding project-related deposits)
at the BCEAO.
b. the net position of the Government with commercial banks, including: (a) treasury
bills; (b) treasury bearer bonds; and (c) loan and advances of commercial banks to the
central Government; less central Government deposits (excluding project-related
deposits) in commercial banks;
1

The source of the cross exchange rates is International Financial Statistics.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

51

GUINEA-BISSAU

6.
Adjustment clauses. The ceiling on changes in NCG will be adjusted (a) upwards
(downwards) by up to the CFA value of the shortfall (excess) in external program grants and
loans, including IMF drawings—the upward adjustment will be capped at the equivalent of CFA
10 billion; and (b) downwards (upwards) by the excess (shortfall) in the CFA value of any
programmed privatization receipts. In addition, central government deposits at the BCEAO and
the commercial banks will be adjusted downwards by any clearance of domestic arrears in excess
of program.
7.
Data source. The data source for the above will be the Table “Position Nette Du Tresor”,
submitted to the IMF staff monthly and adjusted by the stock of project-related deposits at the
BCEAO and the commercial banks.
8.
Definition of Central Government. Central government is defined for the purposes of
this memorandum to comprise the central administration of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau and
does not include any local administration, the central bank nor any other public or governmentowned entity with autonomous legal personality not included in the government flow-of-funds
table (TOFE).

C. New Non-Concessional External Debt Contracted or Guaranteed by
the Central Government with an Original Maturity of One Year or
More
9.
Definition. Those are defined as all forms of new debt with original maturity of one year
or more contracted or guaranteed by the central government. For this purpose, new nonconcessional external debt will exclude normal trade credit for imports and debt denominated in
CFA franc, but will include domestically held foreign exchange (non-CFA franc) debts. This PC
applies not only to debt as defined in the Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to
Foreign Debt (Decision No. 12274 (00/85), August 24, 2000, Point 9, as revised on August 31,
2009, (Decision No. 14416–(09/91)) but also to commitments contracted or guaranteed for which
value has not been received. Excluded from this PC are disbursements from the IMF and those
debts subject to rescheduling or for which verbal agreement has been reached. This PC will apply
on a continuous basis.

D. External Short-Term Debt Contracted or Guaranteed by Central
Government
10.
Definition. External short-term debt is defined as external debt stock with a maturity of
less than one year contracted or guaranteed by central government. Debt is defined in Annex I of
this TMU. For this purpose, short-term debt will exclude normal trade credit for imports and debt
denominated in CFA franc, but will include domestically held foreign exchange (non-CFA franc)
debts. For the purposes of this PC, central government is as defined in paragraph 8 above. This
PC will apply on a continuous basis.

52

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

GUINEA-BISSAU

E. External Payment Arrears of the Central Government
11.
Definition. External payment arrears of the central government are defined to include all
debt-service obligations (interest and principal) arising from loans contracted or guaranteed by
the government. The non-accumulation of external arrears is a continuous performance criterion
during the program period. For the purposes of this performance criterion, external arrears are
obligations that have not been paid on due dates (taking into account the contractual grace
periods, if any). Excluded from this PC are those debts subject to rescheduling or restructuring
(once a contractual agreement is signed or a verbal agreement reached), or are under litigation
or negotiation. In addition, arrears on membership fees (which are to non-financial international
organizations) are excluded. This PC will apply on a continuous basis.

QUANTITATIVE INDICATIVE TARGETS
A. New Domestic Arrears of Central Government
12.
Definition. The ceiling on domestic arrears are defined as accounts payable (rest-apayer) accumulated during the year, and still unpaid by one month after the quarter for wages
and salaries (including pensions), and three months for goods, services and transfers, evaluated
at the end of September 2015, and March 2015.

B. Social and Priority Poverty-Related Expenditures
13.
Definition. Social and Priority Poverty-related expenditures are defined to include
spending on health, education, and the gender ministry (Table 3).

C. Domestic Primary Balance (Commitment Basis)
14.
The domestic primary fiscal deficit on a commitment basis is calculated as the
difference between government revenue and domestic primary expenditure on commitment
basis. Government revenue includes all tax and nontax receipts and excludes external grants.
Domestic primary expenditure consists of current expenditure plus domestically financed capital
expenditure, excluding all interest payments. Government commitments include all expenditure
for which commitment vouchers have been approved by the Ministry of Finance; automatic
expenditure (such as wages and salaries, pensions, utilities, and other expenditure for which
payment is centralized); and expenditure by means of offsetting operations.

D. Non-Regularized Expenditure (DNTs)
15.
Definition. Any treasury outlay not properly accounted for by the National Budget
Directorate and/or not included in the budget.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

53

GUINEA-BISSAU

PROGRAM MONITORING
16.
In the first year of the ECF arrangement two semiannual reviews are scheduled, the first
will be based on PCs at end-June 2015 and completed on or after October 15, 2015, and the
second review will be based on PCs at end-December 2015 and completed on or after April 15,
2016. The Bissau-Guinean authorities shall recommend policy responses, inform the IMF monthly
about the progress of the program, and transmit supporting information necessary for the
evaluation of QPCs and benchmarks in electronic format as indicated in the attached summary
table to IMF staff (Table 1). The government will report any new external borrowing and its terms
to Fund staff as soon as external debt is contracted or guaranteed by the government, but no
later than within two weeks of such external debt being contracted or guaranteed.
17.
To properly monitor key macroeconomic variables, including performance
indicators under the ECF, coordinate technical assistance and monitor progress in
implementation of reforms, the government will staff its reform unit and provide it with
the necessary means. This reform unit periodically reports to the Minister of Finance progress in
achieving agreed performance indicators and development objectives. It will also keep updated
lists of all its partners, prioritize technical assistance and agree with partners on the division of
labor in technical assistance. Finally, it will ensure the information sharing, including TA reports,

Annex I. Implementation of the Revised Executive Board––
Decision on Performance Criteria with Respect to Foreign Debt
The term “debt” has the meaning set forth in Executive Board Decision, No. 6230-(79/140), Point
9, as amended, and which reads as follows: “(a) For the purpose of this guideline, the term “debt”
will be understood to mean a current, i.e., not contingent, liability, created under a contractual
arrangement through the provision of value in the form of assets (including currency) or services,
and which requires the obligor to make one or more payments in the form of assets (including
currency) or services, at some future point(s) in time; these payments will discharge the principal
and/or interest liabilities incurred under the contract. Debts can take a number of forms, the
primary ones being as follows: (i) loans, i.e., advances of money to obligor by the lender made on
the basis of an undertaking that the obligor will repay the funds in the future (including deposits,
bonds, debentures, commercial loans, and buyers’ credits) and temporary exchanges of assets
that are equivalent to fully collateralized loans under which the obligor is required to repay the
funds, and usually pay interest, by repurchasing the collateral from the buyer in the future (such
as repurchase agreements and official swap arrangements); (ii) suppliers’ credits, i.e., contracts
where the supplier permits the obligor to defer payments until sometime after the date on which
the goods are delivered or services are provided; and (iii) leases, i.e., arrangements under which
property is provided which the lessee has the right to use for one or more specified period(s) of
time that are usually shorter than the total expected service life of the property, while the lessor
retains the title to the property. For the purpose of the guideline, the debt is the present value (at
the inception of the lease) of all lease payments expected to be made during the period of the
agreement excluding those payments that cover the operation, repair, or maintenance of the
property. (b) Under the definition of debt set out above, arrears, penalties, and judicially awarded
damages arising from the failure to make payment under a contractual obligation that
constitutes debt are debt. Failure to make payment on an obligation that is not considered debt
under this definition (e.g., payment on delivery) will not give rise to debt”. (c) Excluded from this
performance criterion are normal import-related credits, disbursements from the IMF, and those
debts subject to rescheduling arrangements.”

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to
materialize in the view of the IMF staff. The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks
surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and
30 percent, and “high” a probability between 30 and 50 percent). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall
level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.

AND REQUEST FOR A THREE-YEAR ARRANGEMENT UNDER
THE EXTENDED CREDIT FACILITY—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
ANALYSIS UPDATE
Approved By
Roger Nord and Peter
Allum (IMF) and John
Panzer (IDA)

Prepared jointly by the Staffs of the International
Monetary Fund and the International Development
Association.1, 2

Guinea-Bissau faces a moderate risk of debt distress, based on an assessment of public and
publicly guaranteed external debt, but a heightened overall risk of debt distress, reflecting
the currently high level of total public debt. Compared to last year’s Debt Sustainability
Analysis (DSA) update,3 the current assessment scales down non-concessional domestic
borrowing to a more realistic, affordable and sustainable trajectory, in line with the
authorities’ commitment to prioritize concessional borrowing and grants. It also assumes
higher economic growth along with increases in imports of capital goods that support
investment and growth. Under the baseline scenario, all indicators are below their
indicative policy-dependent thresholds throughout the projection period. However, the PV
of debt-to-exports ratio breaches its threshold under the most extreme shock scenario.
Overall public debt, while slightly above its indicative threshold over the next three years, is
projected to decline in the medium to long term. There is need to pursue prudent fiscal and
debt management policies and strengthen debt management capacity. The results of the
DSA are contingent on the authorities successfully implementing structural reforms,
improving the business environment to boost production and exports, and continuing to
rely mainly on concessional borrowing.

1

The DSA was prepared jointly by the staffs of the IMF and IDA, in consultation with the Debt Management Unit
of Bissau-Guinean Ministry of Finance, and benefitted from comments from the World Bank. The fiscal year of
Guinea-Bissau is January 1–December 31.

2

Debt sustainability thresholds are determined by the three-year (2011–13) average of the Country Policy and
Institutional Assessment (CPIA) rating (2.7), which classifies Guinea-Bissau as having weak policy performance
and institutional framework.

BACKGROUND
1.
Overall, Guinea-Bissau’s public external debt position has improved somewhat, prompted
by concessional financing, but careful debt management is crucial for sustainability. The debt burden
has been declining in recent years due to net repayments to multilateral and bilateral creditors (Text
Table 1). All debt owed to Paris Club creditors (except Russia and Brazil4) has been canceled or rescheduled
as specified in the Paris Club Agreed Minutes for Guinea Bissau’s debt treatment, following HIPC and MDRI
assistance. About half of the remaining public external debt is owed to multilateral creditors and the other
half to non-Paris Club creditors. The government is current on all scheduled debt service to these creditors,
except for technical arrears. Technical arrears are either debt under negotiation for rescheduling or debt for
which verbal agreement for debt rescheduling or cancellation has been reached (see also footnote 1 of
Text Table 1). The authorities are making best efforts to conclude rescheduling agreements with these
bilateral creditors and have a credible plan and projected financing in place to eliminate the arrears with
multilateral creditors. They are also making good faith efforts to reach a collaborative agreement to resolve
their arrears to the Franco-Portuguese bank.

Public domestic debt has increased in recent years but is expected to decline in the
medium term. Guinea-Bissau issued a CFAF 10 billion Treasury bond in 2013 and another
CFAF 15 billion in 2014, increasing the domestic debt to GDP ratio to 34.7 percent in 2014. The

reclassification in 2014 of debt owed to the West African Development Bank (BOAD) to domestic
debt added some 1 percent of GDP to domestic debt.5 It is expected to decline gradually in the
medium term, averaging 30.1 percent of GDP during 2015–20, reflecting the authorities’
commitment to switch away from expensive domestic debt to more concessional external debt
contracting.6

UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS
3.
The macroeconomic outlook reflects recent political and macroeconomic stability,
particularly following the 2014 elections. The success of the elections, recent IMF support under
the Rapid Credit facility (RCF), the success of the country’s roundtable meetings in Brussels in March
2015 to solicit financing from development partners for re-building the economy, and the prospects
of an IMF ECF-supported program, have helped the resumption of financial support by GuineaBissau’s development partners. Therefore, the baseline scenario assumes economic recovery to be
driven by a rise in investments financed through concessional borrowing and grants. In particular,
compared to the previous DSA, current assumptions are:


The medium-term growth projections point to an increase in growth relative to the immediate
past years. For 2015, projected GDP growth is 0.7 percentage points higher than under the
previous DSA update, and the long-term average growth is increased to 5.0 percent per year.
This assumes increasing public investment, reflected in a strong increase in imports over the
long term compared to the previous assessment, and continued implementation of sound
macroeconomic policies and structural reforms.



The fiscal projections feature higher revenue and grants than under the previous DSA, along
with correspondingly higher spending. The latter reflects expectations of higher foreign support
for addressing the infrastructure gap and enhancing the efficiency of, and access to, public
service delivery in priority health and education sectors. As a result, the primary balance is
projected at 0.8 percent of GDP, but to worsen to average 1.3 percent per year in the long term
(Text Table 2).7



The non-interest external current account deficit is projected to decline to average 4.6 percent
of GDP in the long term, reflecting the authorities’ efforts to improve the business environment,
including upgrades to infrastructure, and to increase exports. Historical non-interest current
account figures, as well as exports and imports figures, have been revised by the authorities to
more fully capture available information.

5

Since the 2014 DSA, BOAD is considered to be domestic debt, in line with the treatment applied by other WAEMU
countries.

6

The authorities are in the process of auditing an old stock of domestic arrears dating back to before 2013 and
estimated at around 10 percent of GDP. Once these audits are completed and arrears are recognized, the public
debt outlook would deteriorate.

7

The reckoning of the primary balance follows closely the definition used in the framework for low-income countries’
DSA, and thus differs from the concept of domestic primary balance used in the Staff Report.

Box 1. Baseline Macroeconomic Assumptions
Real GDP growth is projected to reach 4.7 percent in 2015, following poor economic growth in 2012
(-1.8 percent) and 2013 (0.8 percent), and a slight recovery in 2014 (2.5 percent). The pickup in 2014 was
mainly due to the resumption of infrastructure investments, provision of water and electricity, and
expansion in cashew nuts production. Over the long run, growth is expected to stabilize at around
5 percent, on account of sound economic policies, increased investment, particularly in infrastructure,
and structural reforms (in public financial management, tax administration and debt management) with
associated efficiency gains.
Consumer price inflation declined continuously from 2.1 percent in 2012 to -1 percent in 2014,
following years of depressed consumer demand as payment arrears were accumulated. With the
clearance of payment arrears and increasing cashew nut prices, disposable incomes are expected to
recover. As a result, inflation is expected to increase to 1.3 percent and 2.3 percent in 2015 and 2016,
respectively, and converge to 3 percent in the medium to long term.
Government balances: The primary fiscal deficit is expected to reach 0.8 percent of GDP in 2015, and
1.3 on average in the medium to long term. Reflecting these developments, domestic debt is projected
to decline in the medium term, reaching around 24.7 percent of GDP by 2020. In the long run, the
authorities’ commitment to prudent debt management, coupled with regular repayment of outstanding
debt, is expected to help decrease the public debt-GDP ratio significantly by the end of the projection
period, 2035.
External current account balance: The expected increase in imports, partly to finance infrastructure
development, and the expected short-term weakening of the fiscal balance are expected to increase the
external current account deficit to average 6 percent of GDP per year during 2015–20. Thereafter, the
current account deficit is expected to improve to around 5 percent of GDP by 2035, reflecting improved
exports and fiscal performance.
Financing flows: FDI is expected to pick up, as political stability takes hold and the business
environment and infrastructure are improved. Current official transfers are expected to average
1.7 percent of GDP during 2015–20, and to remain at about this level until the end of the projection
horizon. Concessional loans are assumed to be at the standard terms—i.e., on 0.75 percent interest rate
with 40 (IDA) and 50 (AFDB) years maturity and ten-year grace period. Paris Club (Non-Paris Club) loans
assume average interest rates of 1.9 (1.6) percent with 23 (23) years of maturity and 11 (6) years grace
period.

EXTERNAL AND PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
External Debt Sustainability Analysis
4.
Under the baseline scenario, all debt burden indicators are expected to remain under their
respective policy-dependent thresholds. Reflecting scaled up concessional external borrowing, PV
indicators are expected to increase in the medium-term but to remain at sustainable levels over the whole
projection period. External debt service is expected to increase in the medium to long term, resulting in
gradual increases in the debt service-to-exports ratio and the debt service-to-revenue ratio.
5.
While favorable under the baseline, the external debt outlook is sensitive to extreme shocks.
Based on standardized stress-tests, Guinea-Bissau’s external debt outlook is particularly vulnerable to an
export shock. Under this extreme shock scenario, the PV of debt-to-exports indicator breaches the
threshold by 2017 and remains above it for the remainder of the projection period (Figure 1c). A shock to
the terms of trade or a one time-depreciation would also result in a significant deterioration in other
indicators of external public debt vulnerability. However, these indicators would remain well below the
thresholds even under these extreme scenarios. Nonetheless, the assessment is highly susceptible to a
breach of the debt-to-exports ratio, given the country’s narrow export base, exposure to cashew price
volatility, and the risk that the planned investments may not in the end help diversify and boost exports.

Public Debt Sustainability Analysis
6.
Total (external and domestic) public debt indicators are projected to decline gradually
over time after an initial increase (Figure 2, Tables 3 and 4). Under the baseline scenario, the PV of
public debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to decline gradually from 42 percent in 2015 to 20 percent by
end-2035, due to the expectation of a switch to more concessional foreign financing of planned
infrastructure projects that are in the pipeline as well as robust economic growth. Likewise, the PV of
public debt-to-revenue ratio is projected to decline gradually into the long term, along with the PV
of debt service-to-revenue ratio. The PV of debt-to-revenue and PV of debt-to-GDP ratios, however,
are sensitive to shortfalls in economic growth (Table 4). However, the overall assessment depends
critically on a favorable baseline scenario for growth, exports, and FDI.
7.
Risks to the baseline scenario are linked to the country’s high dependence on cashew
exports and foreign (concessional) support, and political tensions, but there is also an upside
potential to economic growth. Adverse weather conditions and external market fluctuations could
potentially dampen receipts from cashew exports. A weakening of the external environment could
yield lower-than-expected remittances and concessional support. These factors translate into
important downside risks to the outlook for growth, FDI and the current account dynamics. The
possibility of renewed political instability is a major source of downside risk in the case of GuineaBissau. On the upside, improvements in infrastructure and the business environment would increase
economic growth and exports above the baseline assumptions and reduce the country’s risk of debt
distress. The results of the DSA are contingent on the availability of projected concessional external
financing as well as on the ability of authorities to improve their debt management capacity.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

GUINEA-BISSAU

CONCLUSION
8.
In the staff’s view, Guinea-Bissau faces a moderate risk of debt distress. The
standardized exercise shows that all indicators of external public debt vulnerability would remain
below their policy-dependent thresholds under the baseline assumptions, and total public debt
vulnerabilities are expected to decline in the medium to long term. However, stress tests show that
the outlook is sensitive to shocks, given the narrow export base. Proactive debt management
favorably skewed towards concessional borrowing and grant financing of public investments,
reinforced by steadfast implementation of structural measures to boost exports, could help maintain
(and even improve) these indicators into the medium and long term. To support these policies,
sound macroeconomic management and careful consideration of borrowing opportunities would be
essential.
9.
Prudent debt management and monitoring are critical, as the country gears up to step
up investments in infrastructure and priority social sectors. Non-concessional borrowing from
BOAD in recent years, in view of difficulties in accessing external financing, has resulted in an
increase in domestic debt. Notwithstanding the domestic debt dynamics described above, it is
essential to strengthen debt management, particularly as the country gears up to close the
infrastructure deficit and improve public service delivery. Any sizable negative deviation from the
fiscal projections under the ECF-supported program would stall the projected decline in the public
debt path.

AUTHORITIES’ VIEWS
10.
The authorities broadly concur with the staff’s views on debt sustainability analysis
and recommendations. They agree that debt sustainability depends crucially on sound
macroeconomic policies that would in turn increase their chances of accessing concessional
financing. They emphasized that the pace of public investment would be determined on the basis of
available external concessional resources. Thus, some risks identified in this DSA may not
materialize. The authorities recognize the contributory role of prudent debt management and
implementation of structural reforms to improve the business environment and to enhance overall
growth and export prospects.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate
changes.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the
baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Assistance committed under the original framework is expressed in net present value (NPV) terms at the completion
point, and assistance committed under the enhanced framework is expressed in NPV terms at the decision point.
Hence these two amounts cannot be added.
4/
Under the enhanced framework, an additional disbursement is made at the completion point corresponding to interest
income earned on the amount committed at the decision point but not disbursed during the interim period.
5/
The MDRI provides 100 percent debt relief to eligible member countries that qualified for the assistance. Grant
assistance from the MDRI Trust and HIPC resources provide debt relief to cover the full stock of debt owed to the Fund
as of end-2004 that remains outstanding at the time the member qualifies for such debt relief.

Implementation of Post-Catastrophe Debt Relief (PCDR): Not Applicable
Safeguards Assessments:
The Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) is a common central bank of the countries of the
West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAMU). The latest assessment of the BCEAO was
completed on December 13, 2013. The assessment found that the bank continued to have a strong

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

GUINEA-BISSAU

control environment and has, with the implementation of the 2010 Institutional Reform of the
WAMU, enhanced its governance framework. Specifically, an audit committee was established to
oversee the audit and financial reporting processes, transparency has increased with more timely
publication of the audited financial statements, and the BCEAO was committed to IFRS
implementation by end-2014. The assessment also identified some limitations in the external audit
process and recommended that steps be taken to ensure the adequacy of the mechanism through
selection of a second experienced audit firm to conduct joint audits.
Exchange System and Exchange Rate Arrangement
Guinea Bissau accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 with effect from
January 1, 1997. It joined the WAEMU in 1997, and has no separate legal tender. The exchange
system is free from multiple currency practices and exchange restrictions on the making of
payments and transfers for current international transactions. Since January 1, 1999, the CFA franc
has been pegged to the Euro at a fixed rate of € l=CFAF 655.957. On May 20, 2015, the rate of the
CFA franc in terms of the SDR was CFAF 834.61=SDR 1. Effective January 1, 2007, the exchange
arrangement of the WAEMU countries has been reclassified to the category of conventional pegged
arrangement from the category of exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender. The new
classification is based on the behavior of the common currency, whereas the previous classification
was based on the lack of a separate legal tender. The new classification thus reflects only a
definitional change, and is not based on a judgment that there has been a substantive change in the
exchange regime or other policies of the currency union or its members.
Article IV Consultation
Guinea-Bissau was on the 12-month consultation cycle; staff proposes a switch to a 24-month cycle.
The last Article IV consultation discussions with Guinea-Bissau were held in Bissau, April 29–May 10,
2013. The staff report was discussed by the Executive Board and the consultation was concluded on
June 21, 2013. Elections in 2014 and subsequently the time needed for the formation of a new
Government delayed the current 2015 Art. IV consultation.

WORLD BANK GROUP RELATIONS
1.
Guinea-Bissau joined the World Bank three years after independence in 1977. The
International Development Association (IDA) has approved 50 projects (including trust
funded projects) for Guinea-Bissau, totaling commitments of US$433 million. As a grant
recipient, Guinea-Bissau has 5 current grants from the IDA as of April 14, 2015. The current portfolio
consists of IDA lending operations and Trust Funds. IDA-funded projects amount US$78.5 million.
They include emergency electricity and water rehabilitation, bio-diversity conservation, rural
community-driven development, public sector strengthening, private sector rehabilitation and
agribusiness development and regional fisheries. Trust-funded grants–– drawing on European Union
funds, the State and Peace-Building Fund, and the Global Environmental Facility––provide an
additional US$15 million for emergency food security, including rice production and school
feeding/food-for-work programs in collaboration with the World Food Program (WFP), as well as
participatory rural development, and to provide technical assistance to the emerging extractive
industries sectors.
As of April 14, 2015, Guinea-Bissau had 3 credits from IDA. As a borrower, based on an original
principle of US$ 84 million, US$88.6 million has been disbursed. Guinea-Bissau’s borrower’s
obligation is US$51.1 million.
Budget Support Operations
2.
The Bank does not currently provide budget support to Guinea-Bissau. However, as in
2014, under the 2015-2016 Country Engagement Note (CEN), the Bank envisages to scale up
payments of salaries for teachers and health workers for a six-month period in 2015. Future budget
support operations will hinge on the progress Guinea-Bissau makes on improving Public Financial
Management.
Lending Program
3.
In May 2015, the Bank approved a CEN for Guinea-Bissau for, based on two pillars: (i)
building institutions and (ii) strengthening the provision of basic services. The CEN will guide
the World Bank Group’s engagement in Guinea-Bissau in FY15/16, after which it will be replaced by
a Country Partnership Framework (CPF). The CPF will be informed by a Systematic Country
Diagnostic, an analysis of the key constraints to achieving the World Bank Group’s twin goals of
eradicating extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity. This analysis is currently under
preparation and will draw on the Country Economic Memorandum which the World Bank published
in January 2015.
4.
The current IDA Portfolio is composed of six national IDA operations, and one regional
IDA operation for a total commitment amount of US$78.5 million. The focus of the WB
program is is on Emergency Electricity & Water Rehabilitation (US$37.3 million Rural Community
Developmental (US$20 million), Biodiversity Conservation Project (US$1.95 million), Regional

Fisheries (US$6 million), Private Sector Rehabilitation and Agribusiness project (US$8.2 million),
Emergency Food Security support (US$7 million), Public Sector Strengthening Project (US$5 million)
and TA for extractive industries (US$2.86 million). As of April 14, 2015, the IDA undisbursed balance
was US$36 million.
5.
Trust-funded grants provide an additional US$15 million for emergency food security,
including rice production and school feeding/food-for-work programs in collaboration with
the United Nations World Food Program (WFP). These trust-funded grants also go toward rural
community driven development, and technical assistance for economic management, for extractive
industries. The trust-funded grants draw on the State Peace-Building (SPF) Trust Fund (Participatory
Rural Development, Technical Assistance to the Ministry of Finance on Economic Management,
Extractive Industries Sectors Technical Assistance) and European Union funds.

AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK GROUP RELATIONS
6.
From the approval of the first project to the country in 1976, to May 2015, the AfDB
had approved 50 operations for Guinea-Bissau, excluding multinational projects, for a net
commitment of UA 373 million (about CFAF 310 billion). 29.7 percent of these operations have been
in the social sector, 29.2 for infrastructure, 23.2 percent in the multi-sector, 17.5 percent in
agriculture and 2.3 in Finance. As of April 2013, the active portfolio comprises six (6) ongoing
projects representing a total net amount of UA 21.32 million, and a disbursement rate of 18%.
Lending Program
7.
During the period January 2008–April 2014, AfDB approved an interim HIPC debt
release (US$17.48 million), a fragile State Facility grant (UA 2 million), a fish sector support grant
(UA 2 million), a health sector grant (UA 6 million), an emergency support grant to cholera (UA
0.33 million), a capacity building grant to public administration (UA 7.86 million) and an emergency
budget support to budgetary reforms (UA 5.7 million).
8.
In May 2015, the AfDB approved a new budget support operation to the tune of UA5
million (FCFA 4.1 million). The program is built around two components: (i) the strengthening of
transparency, internal and external control of budget execution and the fight against corruption, and
(ii) the strengthening of budget management. It will be complemented by an institutional support
project of UA5m (FCFA 4.1 million) under finalisation.
9.
In the non-governance sector, the AfDB is currently preparing a UA 13.3 million
energy project for the rehabilitation of the electricity network of the city of Bissau. The project will
be co-financed by the European Investment Bank for up to EUR 10 million.
Non-lending Program
10.
In January 2015, the AfDB approved its 2015-2019 country strategy and Country
Portfolio Performance Assessment. The approved strategy is based on two pillars, namely (i)

strengthening of governance and the foundations of the State; and (ii) development of
infrastructure that will foster inclusive growth. A Regional Integration Strategy Paper for West Africa
for 2011–15 was released in March 2011. Recent economic and sector studies include a review of the
transport sector, the agriculture sector and a country gender profile to be released in the course of
2015.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data have serious shortcomings that significantly hamper surveillance.
Shortcomings are most serious in the national accounts and balance of payments. Data
compilation was impaired during the 1998–99 civil conflict. Given weak capacity and
outdated practices, the authorities have improved their data compilation in the recent years,
with technical assistance from international and regional institutions.
National Accounts: In the second quarter of 2010, the National Institute of Statistics (INE)
published revised national accounts data for 2003–08, based on the System of National
Accounts 1993. Since then, the INE has continued to release annual national accounts data.
The new data have a broader coverage of all sectors of the economy, and as a result, the
GDP level has doubled. The new data provides GDP in both current and constant (2003)
prices, and GDP deflators. Several missions from AFRITAC West, during 2013 to 2015,
continued improving the compilation of national accounts. Recently a TA from AFRITAC
recommended revising GDP data from 2013 onwards to reflect better data sources from
balance of payments and producer prices.
Price Statistics: Since July 2002, a harmonized consumer price index (CPI) has been
compiled, based on the same methodology as in other West African Economic and Monetary
Union (WAEMU) countries. The CPI was updated in 2010 (new base year 2008-2009,
improvement in compilation techniques, extended coverage of products and increase in
outlets). Price data are collected only for the capital city, Bissau. An AFRITAC mission
improved recently the compilation of CPI based on revised estimates of the average final
household consumer price for 2011.
Government Finance Statistics: Since 2007, the monthly worksheet table for the State
Financial Operations is compiled on a regular basis and used as a basic tool for monitoring
the program by the IMF. In March 2010, a government finance statistics (GFS) mission from
West AFRITAC provided technical assistance to the authorities in compiling and
disseminating GFS and implementing action plans designed to improve the GFS data
dissemination to users. Under the West AFRITAC work program, a government finance
statistics technical assistance missions visited GNB in October 2013 and September 2014.
These missions stressed the need for the Ministry of Economy and Finance to start
implementing the recommendations of previous GFS missions.
Monetary and Financial Statistics: Monetary and financial statistics, compiled and
disseminated by the regional Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO), are broadly
adequate, and their institutional coverage is comprehensive. Accuracy is somewhat
hampered by the use of outdated sorting coefficients to estimate cross-border amounts of
banknotes among BCEAO countries, which in turn are used to estimate currency in
circulation and to adjust the net foreign assets of each member country.

Financial Sector Surveillance

Balance of Payments Statistics: Guinea-Bissau reports balance of payments, and
international investment position statistics to STA on an annual basis but with delays.
Guinea-Bissau moved to BPM6 methodology for both balance of payments and international
investment position statistics in September 2013 reviewing back series since 2007. Balance of
payments data are weak, mostly due to substantial unregistered trade and inconsistencies
between financial account transactions and the position data in the IIP. The large number of
small-scale operators, a large informal sector, and institutional weaknesses hamper the data
collection. While no external debt data are published by the Ministry of Finance, stock and
flow data are regularly produced and transmitted to the BCEAO. Guinea-Bissau also
participates in the Coordinated Direct Investment Survey (CDIS) and has been reporting
inward direct investment position as at end December 2011.
Data Standards and Quality
Guinea-Bissau has participated in the General
Data Dissemination System since
November 2001. Metadata for all data
categories and plans for improvement need to
be updated.

No data ROSC is available.

Reporting to STA
Currently no monthly, quarterly or annual government finance data is submitted for
reporting in the International Financial Statistics (IFS) or the Government Finance Statistics
Yearbook. Monthly data on monetary statistics for Guinea Bissau are reported on a regular
basis for publication in the IFS with some delays.

Statement by Mr. Ngueto Tiraina Yambaye, Executive Director for Guinea-Bissau and
by Mr. Siradiou Mamadou Bah, Senior Advisor to the Executive Director
July 10, 2015

I. Introduction
On behalf of our Bissau-Guinean authorities, we would like to thank Staff, Management and
the Executive Board for their continued support to Guinea-Bissau. Following the successful
completion of the legislative and presidential elections in April and May 2014, the new
Government set itself the task to address the country’s development challenges. The
authorities are appreciative of the Fund technical assistance, policy dialogue and the
disbursement received in November 2014 under the Rapid Credit Facility to address the
country’s balance of payments and financing needs for 2014. This financial support has
catalyzed the resumption of donors’ assistance and paved the way for the implementation of
the much-needed reforms. In this regard, a ten-year development plan has been prepared and
it aims at consolidating past progress and to transform the economy going forward. The
constructive engagement of the Fund has been instrumental in helping our authorities
organized in March 2015, in Brussels, a Donors’ Roundtable which was successful. In this
meeting, donors pledged about 1.5 billion USD to support the authorities’ development
projects, over the next ten years, including the reform of the security sector.
Cognizant of the daunting socio-economic challenges facing Guinea-Bissau, our authorities
are strongly committed to strengthen the newly recovered political stability and lay out the
solid foundations for a higher, sustained and inclusive economic growth and to fight poverty.
In this regard, they have adopted a strategic plan for 2014–18 to further enhance the fiscal
position, deepen structural reforms, mitigate vulnerabilities and develop a vibrant private
sector supportive of growth and employment. In support of their strategic plan, the
authorities are requesting a three-year arrangement under the IMF Extended Credit Facility
(ECF). Based on a broad consensus and the positive results of policy measures implemented
under the RCF, our Bissau Guinean authorities are strongly determined to implement the
ECF-supported arrangement to maintain macroeconomic stability, improve public finance
management, implement needed reforms to promote better governance and enhance private
sector development.
II. Recent Economic Developments
In 2012–13, the economy experienced a deep deterioration due notably to the suspension of
donors’ assistance, sharp decline in the international price of cashew and a lax fiscal policy.
In this context, growth contracted by 1.8 percent in 2012 and increased by only 0.8 percent in
2013. The overall fiscal balance deteriorated by 4.6 percent of GDP in 2012 and by
5.3 percent of GDP in 2013. Over the period, the current account deficit also increased to
4.4 percent of GDP. With a decline in farm-gate cashew nut prices (the country’s main

2
source of export proceeds) by over 60 percent, poverty soared and food insecurity doubled.
Moreover, the budgetary pressures translated into tight compression in social spending and
large accumulation of domestic and external arrears.
Our authorities are strongly determined to reverse this situation initiated in the second half of
2014 a set of reforms that have begun to yield positive results in restoring macroeconomic
stability and fostering economic growth by implementing a strict budgetary management in
the face of tight financing constraints. In 2014, real GDP growth is estimated at 2.5 percent
driven by an increased cashew nuts harvest, construction and telecommunications services.
Average inflation declined to -1 percent in a context of decreasing global food and fuel
prices. Thanks to measures tightening controls over fuel imports, streamlining tax
exemptions and intensified auditing of large tax payers, total revenue amounted to 12 percent
of GDP in 2014 from 8.1 percent of GDP in 2013. The increases in revenues coupled with
the donors’ assistance and the issuance of one-year Treasury –bills on the regional capital
market enabled the authorities to clear a large amount of arrears accrued in recent years. The
overall fiscal balance is estimated at 2.2 percent of GDP and the current account deficit
declined to 1.2 percent of GDP in 2014. As regards the FUNPI (the Fund to promote the
Industrialization of Agricultural Products) issue, the authorities have suspended the cashew
nuts collections this year due to the lack of positive impact of the Fund on the sector. This
measure will lead to an increase in the income of cashew producers; reduce the amount of
smuggling and poverty as well.
The Bissau Guinean authorities are grateful to the Fund for its contribution to the successful
Donors’ Round Table held on March 25, 2015 in Brussels. The authorities presented their
medium-term development strategy for 2015–25 and sought the assistance and contribution
of international partners for its financing. The plan’s objectives are to increase investment in
infrastructure, diversify the economy through the development of agriculture and agroindustry, fishery, tourism and mining sectors, and reform the security sector.
As regard the reform in the security sector, significant progress has been made since last
September. The authorities have announced a number of initiatives aimed at reforming and
professionalizing the armed forces. This includes the first retirement of 500 soldiers by the
end of 2015. With the external assistance, they will develop a sustainable pension scheme for
affected security personals. Already a decree creating a special pension fund over the next
five years has been issued.
III. Medium-Term Program and Policies for 2015
The steadfast implementation of the ECF-supported program will enable our authorities to
solve the country’s financing difficulties while addressing the challenges related to growth
and poverty reduction. In this regard, they are committed, to take steps to increase revenues,

3
finance key public services, and foster sustained and inclusive growth to reduce poverty in
the country.
1. Fiscal Policy and Debt Sustainability
The fiscal policy will aim at increasing fiscal revenues through the implementation of needed
reforms to finance key public services. In executing the 2015 budget, if revenues exceed
budgeted resources, the additional resources will be allocated to non-salary priority sending.
Moreover, to improve treasury management, transparency and budgetary controls, steps will
be taken towards the creation of a Treasury Single Account (TSA), and the Treasury
Committee and communication will be strengthened. The authorities are also committed to
minimize the use of improperly documented expenditure (DNTs) to emergency cases. To
better manage the wage bill, the financial module of the payroll will be consolidated with the
administrative module. This will address the deficient link between the payment of salaries
and the human resource management while reducing the number of ghost workers. With
regard to revenue measures, the authorities will continue to implement, enlarge and deepen
reforms initiated to improve tax collection. In particular, controls and inspections of large
and medium-size companies will be increased as well as tax audits and payments of taxes by
non-compliant taxpayers. In addition, actions streamlining the tax system will be enforced to
reduce distortions and improve tax collection. In the same vein, efforts to further restrict tax
exemptions and fine-tune subsidies will be pursued.
The authorities welcome the debt sustainability analysis update highlighting that Guinea
Bissau faces a moderate risk of debt distress. However, the high level of total public debt has
led to a heightened overall risk of debt distress. Given the need to further improve fiscal and
debt sustainability, the authorities are committed to pursue prudent fiscal and debt
management policies while strengthening debt management capacity. With technical
assistance from the Fund and other development partners, a legal and institutional framework
for public debt management and debt contracting procedures will be introduced. The
authorities will continue to rely on concessional borrowing and grants to finance investments.
2. Financial Policy
Cognizant of the challenges and vulnerabilities facing the financial sector, the authorities are
determined to safeguard the sector’s stability by following international best practices. In
close collaboration with the WAEMU regional banking commission, they will enforce
compliance with prudential ratios including provisions to non-performing loans and capital
injections. Efforts to deepen the financial intermediation and encourage access to credit and
banking services will be strengthened. The national strategy document for the micro finance
sector will be revised to consolidate existing initiatives.

4
Our Bissau Guinean authorities are committed to continue improving their AML/CFT
framework. In this regard, a national strategy on AML/CFT consistent with the Financial
Action Taskforce on Money Laundering (FATF) standards will be submitted to parliament
by the end of the year. High ranking officials will disclose their assets to the Council of
Ministers by September 2015 and the Financial Intelligence Unit will continue its awareness
raising activities to commercial banks and the general public.
3. Structural Reforms and Fostering Growth
In order to achieve a higher, sustained and inclusive growth, the authorities are determined to
improve the business environment and foster productive investment. Efforts to reduce the
cost of doing business will be pursued through needed investments to close the infrastructure
gap, develop human capital and further promote the rule of law which are critical to
increasing the economy’s overall competitiveness. With international support, the quality of
institutions and public delivery of health and education services will be improved. In
addition, the authorities plan to restructure the electricity and water company (EAGB) into a
profitable, financially healthy enterprise and privatize Guiné Telecom. The audit of FUNPI
will be completed by end September 2015 whose results will serve as the basis for a new
strategy to promote cashew nut production and transformation.
IV. Conclusion
Over the past years, Guinea-Bissau’s economic activities have been severely affected by the
political instability and significant drop of cashew prices with a heavy toll on the public
finances. Under the RCF disbursement, the macroeconomic situation has been stabilized and
far reaching reforms have been initiated which are yielding positive results. The BissauGuinean authorities would like to deepen the reforms already started and to embark on a
medium term economic and financial reform to address the challenges facing the economy.
They have prepared with staff’s assistance a program of adjustment for which they are
requesting Fund support under the ECF. They have full ownership of the program and are
strongly committed to implement the policy measures set out therein. The program will
constitute a solid foundation to help solve the country’s balance of payments and fiscal
difficulties and lay the foundation for growth and poverty reduction. We would, therefore,
greatly appreciate Directors’ support for this request. Our authorities will also continue to
need the strong support of development partners to further enhance the macroeconomic
stability and reform process to achieve sustained and inclusive growth.
