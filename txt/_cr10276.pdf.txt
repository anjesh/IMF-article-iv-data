Staff Report for the 2010 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2010 Consultation with Austria
Approved by Juha Kähkönen and Tamim Bayoumi
July 29, 2010

Executive Summary


Focus: As Austria is emerging from the recession with worsened public finances,
vulnerabilities in the banking sector, and weaker medium-term growth prospects,
this consultation focused on ways to restore public finances, ensure financial
stability, and enhance sources of future growth.



Background and outlook: The government intervened heavily—through fiscal
stimulus and financial sector support packages, including the nationalization of
some smaller banks. With global demand picking up, the recovery is now
underway, but external uncertainties are significant.



The policy challenges are three-fold:
o Fiscal consolidation should start, as planned, in 2011, to bring debt on a
declining path after 2013. While the government currently plans a 60/40 split
between expenditure and revenue measures, a mostly expenditure-based
consolidation with participation of all levels of government would help
minimize the effects on growth and enhance sustainability.
o Financial stability needs further strengthening. While capital positions have
strengthened, remaining weaknesses in a number of banks need to be
addressed. Despite welcome improvements to the supervisory framework,
some important gaps in supervisory and resolution powers still need to be
filled.
o Structural reforms are crucial to strengthen potential growth in view of lower
growth prospects in some Central, Eastern and South Eastern European
countries and population ageing. The authorities were considering measures to
raise the effective retirement age.

I. THE CONTEXT
1.
The Austrian economy is recovering from a sharp decline in real GDP in 2009.
This 3.9 percent decline was between those experienced by its neighbors Germany and
Switzerland, with which Austria shares a number of features—limited indebtedness of
corporate and households, and strong contributions of trade to growth in the last decade.
2.
Austria is dependent on foreign developments, but is also important for many
Central, Eastern, and South Eastern European (CESEE) countries.1 Exports represent
more than 50 percent of GDP, with Germany and CESEE countries respectively taking up
one third and one fifth of total. Foreign bank claims amount to 140 percent of GDP, half of
which are to the CESEE. About 13 percent of the labor force in Austria is foreign-born.
3.

The legacy of the crisis is apparent on three fronts:



The fiscal deficit and debt of the general government are expected to reach
respectively 4¾ percent and 70 percent of GDP in 2010. In addition to the workings
of automatic stabilizers, these increases largely reflect permanent tax cuts decided
in 2008 and 2009.



The financial sector, weakened by the bursting of credit bubbles in some CESEE
countries, still faces rising nonperforming loans and will be affected by regulatory
changes, while public support schemes are to gradually unwind.



Potential growth will be affected in the context of less dynamism in some CESEE
countries and an ageing population.
II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
A. The Crisis

4.
GDP contracted by 3.9 percent in 2009,
mainly as a result of a trade shock (Figure 1).
Industrial production shrunk by about 12 percent
in 2009.
5.
On the demand side, both net exports and
investment fell sharply. Net trade contributed about
half of the decline in GDP in 2009, while machinery
investment contracted by around 14 percent.

Credit conditions tightened and larger firms increased their recourse to bond financing
(Figure 5). However, the increase in loan spreads to SMEs was in line with past recessions,
the drop in credit followed activity, and surveys suggest that investment reacted more to
depressed demand than to tighter financing conditions. The authorities, too, saw little
evidence of a credit crunch.

6.
Consumption held up thanks to relatively
comfortable balance sheets, limited wealth
effects,2 and still dynamic labor incomes. Parttime and training schemes are estimated to have
reduced the increase in unemployment, from
3.8 percent mid-2008 to 5.1 percent mid-2009, by
about 1 percentage point.3 The authorities also
pointed to the concentration of the shock on capitalintensive industries.

B. Recovery and Uncertainties
7.
Austria is well equipped to benefit from the pick-up in trade. Wage agreements in
Austria are traditionally moderate, and CGER approaches do not point to a misalignment of
the real exchange rate (Figure 3). As trade recovers, GDP growth is expected to reach about
1.5 percent in 2010 and 2011. Given the slack in the economy, inflationary pressures should
remain limited, in spite of the depreciation of the euro. The authorities broadly shared this
view.
8.
However, the outlook is fragile. Given its trade and financial openness, Austria is
particularly exposed to growth and financial shocks, notably in the euro area and CESEE.
While direct financial exposure to Southern euro area countries and Ireland is moderate,
renewed tensions in some CESEE countries could bear on funding costs and profitability of
Austrian banks, with possible implications for domestic credit supply and growth.
C. Medium-Term Perspectives
9.
In the medium run, potential growth is unlikely to return to pre-crisis levels. It
will be affected by ongoing weak investment, including as a result of an ageing population
and lower growth in some CESEE countries (Box 1, Figure 4). While migration is a
mitigating factor, the working age population is slowing down and is expected to start

contracting from 2020 onwards. Overall, potential growth is estimated to have diminished
from around 2 percent in the years preceding the crisis to 1.7 percent by 2014.
Box 1. ‘Boom-Bust’ in CESEE and Implications for Austria4
In the decade preceding the crisis, Austria was able to seize the opportunities arising from
opening up and catching up of CESEE economies. According to empirical studies, EU enlargement
increased Austrian GDP growth by 0.4 percentage points each year, with also positive effects on
employment.5 (Net) exports, FDI to CESEE, and returns from these investments, including in the
financial sector, increased substantially to reach considerable shares of the corresponding aggregates.

Note: In the case of CESEE, gross investment income is a good proxy for net investment income.

However, in some CESEE countries, the convergence process degenerated into a credit boom
which burst in the context of the global financial crisis. Domestic demand in these countries is
anticipated to be well below levels and pace before the crisis, in contrast to the more balanced
economies of the region. GDP is also expected to be affected, though to a lesser extent as countries
reorient to more export-oriented activities. As a result, Austrian exports and returns on investments
could be more subdued than in the past. GDP growth could be lower by about 0.1 to 0.2 percentage
points and the current account balance reduced by 0.3–0.5 percent of GDP over the projection period.

10.
Staff viewed a better utilization of labor resources a priority. While Austria fares
well in research and development, use of labor market resources could be improved in certain
segments of the population (Box 2). The authorities saw the gradual introduction of the 2003
pension reforms and measures to improve the health of workers as ways to increase the
effective retirement age. While welcoming these reforms, staff noted that their introduction
was very gradual and that recent measures have tended to lower participation rates of older
workers. Authorities also pointed to the gradual introduction of compulsory and free preschool education for 5-year olds as a way to improve employment conditions for women and
the socially disadvantaged.

Box 2. The Austrian Labor Market: Issues and Challenges
With moderate growth in unit labor costs, high employment and low unemployment rates, overall,
the Austrian labor market compares favorably with its European peers (Figure 3). Apart from 2008–
09, past collective bargaining agreements have resulted in wage increases comparable with the German
ones, and unemployment is well below the EU average.
However, there are significant differences in employment outcomes across subsets of the population.
Employment rates are low for older workers (41 percent of workers aged 55–64 employed, while the EU
average is 46), and also to some degree for low skilled (below 50 percent relative to 60–65 percent in some
other European countries). Unemployment is high for foreign-born workers. An above average share of
female employment is part-time.

age part-time work and the extension of a
pension scheme for the long-term insured (“Hacklerreglung”). High effective labor tax rates weigh on
employment of the low-skilled. Also, education may be relying excessively on family support, resulting in
one of the largest achievement gap among OECD countries for children with migrant origins. Finally, the
gender wage gap is high and more effective female participation is hampered by a variety of factors,
including the absence of full-day pre-school child care and schools.

11.
A strong implementation of EU directives is also needed to boost competition in
services. OECD indicators suggested restrictions in some utilities sectors as well as in liberal
professions. The authorities pointed at a planned strengthening of the Federal Competition
Authority, measures to decrease administrative burdens for businesses, and several ongoing
regulatory changes. The law on postal markets will enter into force in January 2011,
implying the removal of the remaining monopoly on letters weighting less than 50 grams,
while transposition of the EU Services directive is in process. Transposition of the EU
directive on nondiscriminatory network access in energy markets should be effective
by 2011–12.

III. FISCAL POLICY: FROM STIMULUS TO CONSOLIDATION
12.
While deficit and debt levels do not compare unfavorably with the average of the
euro area, Austria’s fiscal position has weakened significantly (Figure 6). The general
government deficit and debt are set to rise to respectively 4.8 and 70 percent of GDP in 2010,
from 0.5 percent and 59 percent in 2007. Discretionary stimulus measures, which totaled
almost 2 percent of GDP in cumulative terms in 2010, were mostly designed to be
permanent, thus complicating consolidation efforts.

13.
Reducing the deficit to below 3 percent of GDP by 2013 and continuing
consolidation in 2014 and beyond would put the debt-to-GDP ratio on a declining path
from 2014 onwards. Staff supported the continued fiscal stimulus in 2010 given the fragility
of the recovery and lack of evident imbalances.

countries, the authorities were advised to stand ready to take additional measures if needed to
guarantee achievements of targets, or in case of market pressures.

8
14.
The authorities have decided a 60/40 percent split between expenditure and
revenue measures. At the central government level, Parliament has approved new mediumterm expenditure ceilings, 4 percent lower than previous year’s ceilings, binding for each
ministry in 2011. Performance-based budgeting is to be introduced by 2013. While
welcoming these actions, staff noted that the envisaged expenditure reductions will need to
be underpinned by structural measures to be sustainable. The authorities agreed, indicating
that these would be included in the 2011 budget to be transmitted to Parliament in
December 2010. In addition, public health insurance companies are expected to save a total
of 1.7 billion euro over 2010–13 on medical and related fees, leading to a potential
cumulative deficit-reducing impact of some 0.2 percent of GDP. Other measures are yet to be
defined, including a bank levy, expected to yield 500 million euro (close to 0.2 percent of
GDP).

15.
Staff recommended a mainly expenditure-based consolidation at all levels of
government, noting room for rationalization. Evidence suggests that expenditure based
consolidations are more sustainable. Moreover, expenditure levels are elevated in
international comparison in Austria, with outcomes not always commensurate to spending
(Box 3). In several areas with savings potential, such as health care, responsibilities overlap
across government levels. More broadly, the current federal framework suffers from a
number of shortcomings (Box 4). Working groups on administrative reforms have been put
in place but have not resulted in any decision. An overhaul of fiscal federal arrangements
would be desirable to disentangle responsibilities and better align taxing with spending
powers. Staff also recommended revisiting Austria’s internal stability pact, to reduce its
procyclicality—including by adopting expenditure ceilings also at the Laender level—and to
improve compliance through binding sanctions. Finally, as some local governments have
been issuing guarantees in excess of their financial abilities, the mission advised setting
ceilings. The authorities indicated that discussion between government levels would take
place in the fall.



Subsidies: Subsidies exceed the average, with more than half going to public
enterprises (notably railways and hospitals) and the rest being spread on various private
recipients. The authorities’ efforts to improve their administration and increase
transparency should help identify possible savings.



Health: While health spending is higher than the euro area average, life expectancy and
healthy-life years are around average. Hospital spending has a particular high share, as
Austria ranks among the top two in the EU in terms of hospital beds and hospital visits
per inhabitant. Rationalization, which would require increased coordination across
Laender, could help reap scale benefits, see OECD Economic Surveys (2005, 2009)
and WIFO “Optionen zur Konsolidierung der oeffentlichen Haushalte in Oesterreich”
(2010).



Social protection: Spending adds up to some 20 percent of GDP. The share of
pensions is relatively high (around 2/3 against an average of 60 percent), even though
the old-age dependency ratio is close to average.



Education: Education spending is roughly in line with the average. However, this is
due to low enrollment rates at the tertiary level, while spending per student is
consistently higher than average across attainment levels. Results are mixed (evidenced
by PISA scores, for example) and efficiency could be increased, see OECD (2009).

10
Box 4. Fiscal Federalism and the Austrian Stability Pact
Austria’s federal system consists of the federal government, nine states (Laender), and
some 2,350 municipalities.
Intergovernmental fiscal relations are characterized by a strong disconnect between
spending and taxing powers, reflecting fragmentation and overlaps in responsibilities
across government levels. While the sub-national government levels spend almost one third of
general government outlays, their taxing power is very limited–and only exists at municipality
level (communal tax based on enterprises payroll and real estate tax). Resources come mostly
from transfers, co-financing, and shared taxes (notably personal income and corporate taxes
and the value added tax). The complexity of financial flows is augmented by the existence of
numerous extra-budgetary entities at all levels. Fiscal relations are regulated in a fiscal
equalization law that is periodically re-negotiated, usually in connection with the internal
Austrian Stability Pact. The current law is valid for 2008–13 if not renegotiated.
The internal stability pact suffers from design and implementation issues. In 1999, the
“Austrian Stability Pact” was instituted to share fiscal consolidation burdens across layers of
government. The pact sets annual numerical targets for the headline deficit of central
government, Laender, and municipalities. Before the crisis, over-achievement at the federal
level had often compensated under-performance at the Laender level. No sanctions were
enforced. Nominal deficit targets may furthermore be procyclical, although there is some
leeway for temporary deviation. Finally, there seems to be room for improvement in
information exchange and coordination among partners. The most recent pact, supposed to be
valid from 2008 to 2013, is unsurprisingly off track since 2009.

16.
Staff saw little scope for increasing revenues. Austria has one of the highest
overall tax-to-GDP ratios and labor-tax wedges in the European Union, but some taxes are
low or nonexistent (general wealth, inheritance, and gift taxes). In this context, while
advising against large tax increases,

Capitalization continued to improve on the back of capital increases and
deleveraging (Figure 8). While one bank relied solely on intra-group support, the other large
banks received public capital injections, for a total of 7.4 billion euro, complemented in some
cases by private capital. Their deleveraging has amounted to 13 percent of assets so far.
Ratios also improved for the other banks, mostly on the back of private capital. However,
while recent stress tests conducted by the OeNB suggest that the banking sector would on the
whole be able to withstand a double-dip recession scenario, banks’ capital ratios currently
appear to be slightly below peers and there is wide heterogeneity. In this context, the mission

Looking ahead, banks will face a number of headwinds. Some banks rely heavily
on money and financial markets, and a

in neighboring countries—and the
resulting possible multiple taxation of
Austrian banks. The mission advised that bank taxes should be properly designed, and
coordinated, to enhance the resilience of the financial sector.

22.
Banks would be strongly affected by Basel requirements as proposed in
December 2009. Liquidity requirements were seen as overly demanding by banks and the
authorities. There was also high sensitivity to the definition of Tier 1 capital, with minority
interests representing 25 percent of tier 1 capital in Austrian banks. However, no validated
quantitative estimates of the impact of Basel proposal were available, as the quantitative
impact study had not been completed. While recognizing the need to implement measures in

13
a manner that does not adversely affect economic recovery and noting ongoing calibration,
staff stressed that strengthening capital and liquidity positions was needed in light of the
crisis. The authorities agreed with the need to strengthen the global financial system but were
particularly attentive to the fact that new requirements should not put customer oriented
business models at a disadvantage.
23.
Direct exposure to euro area countries that have come under market scrutiny
seems manageable. According to BIS consolidated data, exposure to Southern euro area
countries (excluding Italy) and Ireland represented about $25 billion at end-2009 (6.8 percent
of GDP), while exposure on Italy alone was also about $25 billion. This compares with an
exposure on CESEE of $242 billion (2 3 of GDP). However, in addition to their direct
exposure and if developments were unchecked, Austrian banks would also be affected
through increased counterparty risk and more expensive funding, including as one large bank
is a subsidiary of an Italian group.6
24.
In this context, staff concurred with the authorities on the need to keep the
financial sector support package in place for the time being. The authorities have
obtained EC approval to extend the banking stabilization package until end-2010. Staff
agreed that while care should be taken to limit distortions by tighter access costs and
conditions, as agreed at the EU level, a stronger financial sector is necessary for the removal
of financial support.
25.
Efforts to discourage foreign currency lending are being stepped up. Despite a
string of policy measures since 2003, foreign currency lending still constituted slightly less
than a fourth of banks’ loan exposure on an unconsolidated basis at the end of 2009. Tighter
guidelines were defined by the Austrian Financial Market Authority (FMA) in 2010, with
OeNB assessing compliance through on-site inspections. In Austria, bullet loans with
repayment vehicles, often associated with fx lending—of which some three fourths were
directly exposed to market risk in spring 2009—should no longer be available and when
offered an fx loan, customers must have a natural hedge or the highest credit rating. Banks
are expected to reduce volumes of fx loans over the long term. In the CESEE subsidiaries,
about half of the lending was in foreign currency at the end of 2009. Austrian banks are
requested to avoid non-euro denominated fx lending, and Austrian supervisors are working
with other home and host supervisors. While fx loans to domestic households have started to
decline, they have shown little decrease abroad. The authorities expressed hope that the
European Systemic Risk Board would contribute to working out cooperative solutions among
supervisors. Staff supported ongoing efforts to reduce this source of vulnerability while
avoiding to undermine excessively the financing of CESEE countries.

6

By construction, this bank’s exposures are counted as Italian exposures in BIS consolidated data.

14
26.
The insurance sector recovered in 2009. Overall results of insurance companies
recovered in 2009. FMA noted that stress tests conducted at end-2009 showed a clear
improvement and that the two biggest companies were able to pass all EU-level stress tests.
However, as pensions companies were unable to generate sufficient revenue in 2008, they
had to request additional payments from employers (close to 0.3 percent of GDP) to meet
defined benefit payouts (30 percent of the plans) and will often need to reduce pension
payouts for defined contribution schemes. In state-sponsored retirement provision
(Zukunftsvorsorge), and in line with the FSAP recommendations, minimum investment
requirement in stocks was decreased in January 2010 to 30 percent and a life-cycle model
introduced.
Supervision and regulation
27.
Staff welcomed the ongoing strengthening of supervision. The OeNB is
responsible for fact finding, including off-site and on-site bank supervision, while the FMA
is responsible for decision making, including licensing and enforcement.7 Clear
responsibilities and communication channels have been established between the two
institutions and reflected in a joint report. The supervisory capacity and the number of
inspections have increased, including on a cross-border basis, but the large number (more
than 800) of small banks still implied a lot of reliance on off-site assessments. Also, the
authorities do not have so far the ability to undertake on-site inspections in some non-EU
Member states—Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Russia—comprising 9 percent of all CESEE
exposures. Staff supported ongoing effort to remedy this situation and FMA willingness to be
able to impose greater financial penalties and supervise non-bank activities which have been
a source of vulnerability.
28.
Staff also recommended extending FMA’s early intervention powers and
introducing a specific bank resolution framework. Staff advised putting in place a system
mandating early remedial action, with powers entrusted to the FMA to intervene if needed to
restructure a bank. The authorities felt early intervention powers were important but
expressed reservations on a framework that would rely on hard triggers, as recommended in
the 2008 FSAP update. Furthermore, staff recommended designing a specific bank resolution
framework, as the existing one only provides for a limited range of options (receivership and
insolvency under the standard company law) while other bank resolution methods (e.g.
purchase and assumption, bridge banks, or mergers) are not explicitly recognized.
29.
Staff welcomed Austria’s action plan to remedy strategic deficiencies previously
identified by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). Based on Austria’s commitment to
further improve compliance, the FATF plenary removed Austria from its specific review list
in June 2010. Austria has also accepted article 26 of the OECD model Tax convention.
7

The FMA also participated in interpreting and drafting supervisory legislation.

15
30.
In May 2010, the Republic of Austria acquired the OeNB’s remaining shares
from financial sector institutions and economic interest groups. Regardless of the
ownership structure, staff indicated that the operational and financial independence of the
Central Bank had to be preserved.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
31.
Decisive policy action is needed to preserve Austria’s strengths and address
weaknesses unearthed by the crisis. As an open and competitive economy Austria’s
performance had been strong before the crisis. Going forward, significant integration with
neighboring countries also bears risks, notably in the financial sector. This calls for
determined fiscal consolidation, continued efforts to strengthen financial sector resilience,
and structural measures to support potential growth.
32.
The increase in public debt should be reversed through steadfast consolidation.
As planned, the general government deficit should start decreasing in 2011, be brought below
3 percent by 2013, and continue to decrease thereafter to bring debt on a declining path. With
a debt-to-GDP ratio expected to rise until 2013 even with the planned consolidation, a clear
commitment to a lasting consolidation and sustainability should be signaled and measures
defined early on. Also, the authorities should stand ready to take additional measures if
needed.
33.
A well-designed and mostly expenditure-based consolidation, with participation
of all government levels, could minimize the effects on growth and enhance
sustainability. Savings should be targeted in areas where spending is high and outcomes not
commensurate (health) or where spending could be better targeted (subsidies, social
benefits). In this respect, while the revised medium-term expenditure framework at central
government level is welcome, participation of sub-national levels in consolidation should
also be ensured. To this end, the current framework (“internal stability pact”) needs to be
strengthened and ceilings to local governments’ debt and guarantees issuance need to be
introduced. Across-the-board tax increases should be avoided.
34.
Potential growth should be supported by structural reforms. In particular, special
schemes and long transition periods which are undermining the 2003 pension reforms should
be eliminated. Raising the effective retirement age would enhance sustainability and growth.
In the services sector, competition should be stepped up, including through an effective
transposition of the EU Services Directive.
35.
The overall situation of banks has improved but vulnerabilities remain. As some
banks have weaker capital positions and strong dependence on wholesale and market
funding, the authorities should closely monitor the situation of individual banks, including on
the basis of stress tests results, and ensure appropriate action is taken in a timely manner.

16
36.
Exit policy and new policy measures need to be carefully designed. The extension
of the current financial support package is appropriate. The authorities should furthermore
ensure various measures and regulatory changes considered enhance the resilience of the
financial sector, through proper design and taking into account their combined effects.
37.
Supervision should be further strengthened. A number of positive steps have
already been taken, but FMA powers should be further stepped up. In particular, a system
mandating early remedial action and a proper resolution framework should be put in place.
38.
Providing continued financing to the CESEE region while reducing the share of
foreign exchange loans will be a key challenge. The authorities’ efforts to implement and
enforce tighter fx-lending standards in coordination with other supervisors are welcome.
39.
Steps taken by the authorities to ensure that their financial system cannot be
used for unlawful purposes are welcome. Compliance with FATF recommendations should
be further strengthened.
40.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12month cycle.

Domestic demand in CESEE 's formerly booming economies could be more subdued, constraining the recovery in Austrian
exports. A partial reallocation of resources in CESEE towards exports should however help mitigate the effect.

Austria’s economic and financial integration
with Central, Eastern and South Eastern
European countries (CESEE) increased
considerably up to the crisis (Figure 4,
Table A1).2 With substantial investments
flowing to the region, by 2007, the CESEE
region accounted for nearly half of the total stock
of Austrian FDI, or close to 19 percent of GDP.

particular, Austrian banks established subsidiaries and in many countries control large parts
of financial intermediation. Exports to CESEE also grew rapidly, now representing one fifth
of total. Reflecting Austria’s competitive advantage, intermediary and investment goods
continue to dominate Austrian exports to the region, the rise in the share of consumption

Exports to CESEE in 2008

However, while some countries experienced more
balanced growth, in others, the convergence process
degenerated into a boom/bust credit cycle, whose
legacy of debt overhang and depressed property
markets is likely to weigh on domestic demand and
future credit growth. In the SEEs, but also in the
Ukraine or Hungary domestic demand collapsed in 2009,
following in most cases large expansions of demand and

display relatively high ratios of private sector indebtedness, possibly putting pressure on
agents to deleverage. The Spring 2010 WEO forecast for 2010–15 anticipates domestic
demand in formerly booming (FB) economies to be well below levels and pace before the
crisis, in contrast to the more balanced economies (Other) of the region6: the level of
domestic demand in FB countries’ in 2015 is projected to be about 30 percent less than what
a simple continuation of the trend observed in 2000–08 would have suggested. For the other
countries the difference is only 10 percent.
Austria’s exposure to formerly booming economies is non-negligible and their
rebalancing and hence expected more modest demand growth is likely to dampen
Austrian exports and incomes. Over 40 percent of Austrian exports to CESEE (around
4 percent of GDP) went to FBs, with Hungary and Romania accounting for the bulk.
Anticipated lower domestic demand in FBs could contain the recovery of Austrian exports.
Simple correlations suggest a decline of nominal export growth to the region to 10 percent
in 2010–15, down from close 14 percent in the four year period leading up to the 2009
recession.
Yet, the negative repercussions on Austria could be mitigated by the fact that exports to
CESEE also reflect intra-industry trade, the result of the outsourcing activities of
Austrian firms. A high import content of exports is likely to buffet the effects of an external
shock. And demand for Austrian products may be more dependent on supply performance in
CESEE (e.g. competitiveness of these economies) and on demand developments in third
Austrian exports and Austrian export weighted

course more subdued than in the past, compare favorably with domestic demand, and

Annex II. Austria: Statistical Issues
1.
Macroeconomic statistics are adequate for surveillance. Austria subscribed to the
Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) in 1996, and its metadata are available
on the Fund’s electronic Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board. Austria is availing itself of
the SDDS flexibility option on the timeliness of the industrial production index and the
merchandise trade data.
2.
The transition to the new European System of Accounts 1995 (ESA 1995) has
complicated the analysis of national accounts and fiscal data. The reclassification of public
hospitals in 1997 introduced a break in the national account series on public and private
consumption. Annual fiscal data for 1995 onward are derived from ESA 1995 data reported
to Eurostat, using bridge tables created in a collaborative effort by the Fund and Eurostat.
Data on outlays by function have been revised and are available from 1995 onward on a
comparable basis according to major functional categories. Quarterly fiscal data reported
through Eurostat are disseminated in the IFS.
3.
The ECB reporting framework is used for monetary statistics and data are reported to
the IMF through a “gateway” arrangement with the ECB. The arrangement provides an
efficient transmission of monetary statistics to the IMF and for publication in the IFS and IFS
Supplement.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on Austria
August 30, 2010
1.
This statement provides information that has become available since the staff
report was circulated to the Executive Board on July 30, 2010. The information does not
alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
Supported by a strong contribution of net exports, Austria’s economic growth
picked up as expected in the second quarter. Following a flat outturn in the first quarter,
real GDP rose by 0.9 percent q-o-q in Q2. Exports accelerated, while gross fixed capital
formation continued to contract. Conditions in the labor market further improved over the
summer, with the harmonized seasonally-adjusted unemployment rate falling to 3.9 percent
in June and vacancies in July up by one third compared with a year ago. Inflation declined to
1.7 percent y-o-y in July from 1.8 percent in June.
3.
CEBS stress tests indicated that participating Austrian banks were able to
maintain a tier 1 capital ratio well above 6 percent in the stressed scenarios. The results,
published in July, were consistent with earlier national tests run by the Austrian central bank.
4.
In light of the broad agreement reached in July 2010 by the Group of Governors
and Heads of Supervision of the Basel Committee, while Austrian banks will still need
to strengthen their capital positions compared with previous (Basel II) requirements,
the increase will be more limited than what was implied by the December 2009
proposals. In particular, the Committee will allow some partial recognition of minority
interests in core capital. The Governors and Heads of Supervision are expected to finalize the
calibration and transition arrangements in September.
5.
Reported non performing loans (NPL) of Austrian banks have continued to rise.
Erste Bank and Bank Austria reported an increase in their NPL ratios from 6.6 percent and
3.5 percent at the end of 2009 to 7.3 percent and 4.1 percent respectively at the end of June
2010.
6.
A Memorandum of Understanding on financial supervision is being concluded
with Russia.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2010 Article IV Consultation with Austria
On August 30, 2010, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV Consultation with Austria.1
Background
While severe, Austria’s recession had limited effects on unemployment. In light of its financial
and economic openness, the contraction in world trade and the financial crisis impacted
considerably on activity. Investment declined sharply but consumption helped cushion the
recession, supported by tax cuts and various labor market measures together with large
increases in real wages.
A gradual export-led recovery is underway, with gross domestic product (GDP) growth expected
to reach 1½ percent in 2010 and 2011, after a 3.9 percent contraction in 2009. However,
uncertainties are elevated and mainly center on developments in the international financial
environment.
In the medium term, potential growth is unlikely to return to pre-crisis levels. It will be affected by
population ageing and ongoing weakness in investment, due in part to lower growth prospects
in some Central, Eastern and South Eastern European (CESEE) countries.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
Austria’s fiscal position has weakened significantly in recent years, although to a lesser extent
than the euro area average. As a result of the recession and as a consequence of stimulus
measures of around 2 percent of GDP, mainly consisting of permanent tax cuts, general
government deficit and debt levels are expected to reach respectively 4¾ percent and
70 percent of GDP in 2010.
Public support helped reduce market pressures on Austrian banks. The global financial crisis
and the bursting of credit bubbles in some CESEE countries where Austrian banks are heavily
exposed have weakened the sector. Public financial support, together with the EU/IMFsupported programs, was instrumental in improving market confidence, as evidenced by
declining credit default swap spreads. Capitalization has continued to improve on the back of
capital increases and deleveraging, but there is marked heterogeneity across banks and
nonperforming loans have yet to peak. A particular risk stems from the extent of foreign
currency loans made by subsidiaries in the CESEE region.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for their timely policy response, which has
helped mitigate the impact of the global crisis. They noted that, as an open and competitive
economy, Austria is well placed to benefit from the recovery in world trade, although
considerable risks remain to the growth outlook. Directors also observed that, while Austria’s
significant integration with other countries in central and south-eastern Europe has been
beneficial, it has also exposed the economy to higher risks, notably in the financial sector. In
this context, Directors encouraged the authorities to step up efforts to strengthen the fiscal
position, improve the resilience of the financial system, and enhance medium-term growth
prospects through structural reforms.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ plan to embark on a decisive fiscal consolidation path
beginning in 2011. They saw the planned pace of consolidation as broadly appropriate and
encouraged the authorities to set out concrete commitments and measures early on. Directors
noted, in particular, that well-designed measures, which focus mostly on expenditure and
involve participation of all levels of government, could minimize the effects on growth and
enhance fiscal sustainability. Given the already high overall tax burden, revenue measures
should be well targeted. Directors also recommended strengthening the current fiscal
framework (“internal stability pact”) and introducing ceilings to local governments’ debt and
guarantees issuance.
Directors observed the improvement of the overall financial position of banks, but noted that
more efforts are needed to enhance the resilience of the financial sector. In this context, they
noted that, while care should be taken to avoid distortions, the extension of the current financial
support package is appropriate. Directors also welcomed recent reforms to the supervisory
framework and recommended that regulatory changes and all other measures under
consideration be designed carefully. To strengthen supervision and intervention powers,
Directors encouraged the authorities to consider a system mandating early remedial action and
a proper resolution framework for financial institutions. They also advised the authorities to

3
monitor closely the situation of individual banks in light of the results of stress tests and stand
ready to take action as appropriate.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ efforts to enforce tighter foreign-exchange lending
standards in cooperation with other supervisors. They recognized, however, that reducing the
share of foreign exchange loans, while providing continued financing to central and southeastern Europe, will be challenging. Directors also welcomed the authorities’ action plan
designed to address FATF recommendations.
With medium-term potential growth expected to be lower compared with pre-crisis levels,
Directors welcomed efforts to raise labor participation in some segments of the population
(older, low skilled, and foreign-born workers) and boost product market competition. In this
regard, they saw scope to revisit special schemes and long transition periods in the
implementation of the 2003 pension reform, which are undermining the necessary increase in
the effective retirement age. They also encouraged measures to increase competition in the
services sector, including through an effective transposition of the EU Services Directive.

Statement by Johann Prader, Alternate Executive Director for Austria
August 30, 2010
The Austrian authorities appreciate the consultations with the Fund and commend the staff
for the high quality of the staff report. They broadly concur with the staff's assessment of
Austria's economic situation and its general recommendations on economic, fiscal and
financial policies.
The staff report shows that the worst of the past recession is over and all macroeconomic
indicators, including on employment and unemployment, are improving. The main challenge
is to consolidate the fiscal position without hampering the growth potential, whilst
maintaining the social balance. We also note the Fund’s interest in the Austrian financial
system and its engagement in CESEE.
Short-term and medium-term outlook
Most recent data show that Austria, which suffered from a severe decline of exports last year,
is now benefiting from the resumption of international trade. This has brought capacity
utilisation in manufacturing back close to average, which gives confidence that investment
activity could also turn around towards the end of the year. Private consumption showed
continued moderate growth throughout the crisis, not least thanks to substantial fiscal
stimulus measures. The short-term outlook for the remainder of the year is positive, as
tourism could also gain market shares. Notably, also some CESEE countries benefit from the
current improvement of economic activity, while some others are still in the stage of
adjustment, as rightly stated in the staff report.
The staff report points at factors which might lower GDP-growth in the medium to longterm. While not giving rise to major concerns or questions about the growth model of
Austria, these factors will be monitored and taken into account, when formulating the
medium-term economic and fiscal strategies.
Fiscal policy
At 3.5 % and 4.7 % of GDP in 2009 and 2010, the general government deficit reflects the
biggest stimulus package ever and the operation of automatic stabilizers. Even if the absolute
level of the deficit has remained below the euro area average thanks to the relatively good
performance before the crisis, the government is firmly committed to embark on a decisive
consolidation path. In line with the staff report and European procedures, fiscal consolidation
will start in 2011. Current plans provide for a fiscal deficit of 2.3 % of GDP in 2014, thus
well below the staff’s medium-term macroeconomic framework. With the new budget
framework law in place at the federal level, expenditure ceilings for the years to 2014 have
already been set by Parliament. The spending ministries are currently developing instruments
to cope with the ceilings, which will be implemented with the 2011 federal budget, scheduled

44
for adoption by the end of the year. The authorities could agree with the staff that
consolidation should focus more on the expenditure side, but other factors necessitate also
measures to raise revenues.
Financial sector
In 2009, market confidence in Austrian banks was restored, owing to public financial support
and a more favourable environment created by stepped up central bank liquidity operations
as well as EU/IMF programs in CESEE. At year-end 2009, the banking sector reported a
recovery in bottom-line profitability despite higher risk costs, and capitalization levels
continued to improve on the back of capital increases and deleveraging. The new Basel
requirements will, however, make a further strengthening of Austrian banks’ capital position
necessary.
As evidenced by the latest OeNB stress tests, the Austrian banking sector has shown
resilience to risk. The results of the CEBS stress testing exercise confirmed this assessment
for the major banks, even though Austrian banks were subjected to a more severe CESEE
scenario than their competitors. Furthermore, the disclosure of sovereign portfolios revealed
only a comparatively low direct exposure of Austrian banks to Euro area countries that have
come under market scrutiny.
As of today, it is noteworthy that irrespective of market turbulences, Austrian banks have
lived up to their commitment as long-term investors in CESEE. The responsible role played
by foreign banks in CESEE should also be considered in the discussion on the introduction of
banking taxes in the region – disproportionately high tax levels will certainly not be helpful
for its recovery process and its banking systems. Austrian banks were among the most active
banks in the European Bank Coordination Initiative and continue their cooperation under the
auspices of the EBRD in the “Vienna Initiative Plus”. In this respect, Austria has taken a
prominent role to contribute to the solution of the FX lending issue in CESEE by agreeing
with banks on a set of guidelines to curb the most risky forms of foreign currency lending in
CESEE. A level playing field - to be achieved via the “Vienna Initiative Plus” – will be
essential for the long-term success of these measures. In the domestic market, the Austrian
authorities, in 2010, imposed a de-facto ban on foreign currency loans to un-hedged private
households in Austria, after a string of softer measures proved to be insufficient.
We agree on the importance of keeping the financial sector support package in place for the
time being and of closely monitoring the withdrawal of monetary stimulus measures, as the
banking sector still faces a challenging environment. This concerns inter alia the refinancing
of maturing bonds, the unfolding of credit risks in Austria as well as in CESEE, the
sustainability of current operating profitability levels and the challenges arising from
regulatory changes.
