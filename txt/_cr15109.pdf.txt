STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
Context. Medium- to long-term prospects are promising given Mongolia’s large natural
resources. Nonetheless, the country currently faces serious balance-of-payments (BOP)
pressures on account of low FDI and weak commodity prices, as well as overly loose macro
policies.
Current Outlook. Imports have started to taper off, and, with the first phase of the Oyu
Tolgoi copper and gold mine now in operation, exports have picked up. The trade balance
has thus improved, but with FDI and other financial-account flows still depressed, the overall
BOP remains in substantial deficit. In addition, public debt has risen sharply, and bank
vulnerabilities are growing. Barring a change in policies and/or major new developments in
the real economy, these trends are likely to continue.
Policies. Recognizing these challenges, the new government has already taken some action,
but further policy adjustment is required to stabilize the economy, and structural measures
are needed to promote investment and ensure sustained growth. In particular:
 Credible fiscal consolidation, covering both the traditional budget and the Development
Bank of Mongolia (DBM), is needed to reduce projected deficits, bring public debt under
control, and moderate BOP pressure;
 All fiscal or quasifiscal activity currently undertaken by the DBM, the Bank of Mongolia
(BOM), or other agencies should be conducted on-budget by the government;
 Some monetary tightening would be desirable, to moderate credit growth further and
strengthen the BOP, while ensuring that banks remain adequately liquid;


Exchange rate flexibility should be preserved, as a shock absorber for the economy;

 Banks’ provisions and capital buffers should be bolstered, and supervisory and crisis
preparedness frameworks strengthened;


Governance reforms at the DBM and BOM would help strengthen these institutions;

 Steps should be taken to move ahead with major mining projects, improve the
investment climate, boost FDI, and support growth; and


Social safety nets should be strengthened and better targeted to the poor.

MONGOLIA

CONTEXT
1.
Mongolia has been one of the world’s fastest growing economies as a result of large FDI in
the mining sector. In 2011–12, FDI averaged 40 percent of GDP and annual growth exceeded 15 percent,
and over the past decade, growth averaged 9 percent. One project alone—the Oyu Tolgoi (OT) copper
and gold mine—brought more than $6 billion (50 percent of GDP) in investment during its first phase of
development, with another $5 billion planned for the second phase, and ongoing negotiations over the
Tavan Tolgoi (TT) coal mine could potentially yield $4 billion in investment over the next five years (see
Annex I). Per capita income has reached $4,000, and with mineral wealth estimated at $1 to $3 trillion for a
population of just 3 million, the future looks bright. Within 5 years, when OT-2 comes into production,
Mongolia should be in a position to start running large fiscal surpluses and accumulating savings for
future generations.
2.
Mongolia’s narrow economic base has, however, left the country highly vulnerable to
shocks. Minerals account for 90 percent of all exports, and 90 percent of these are bound for China. This
lack of diversification has made the economy prone to repeated boom-bust cycles, with the balance of
payments falling under intense pressure twice in the past five years, and public finances remaining
vulnerable despite a fiscal framework intended to reduce procyclicality. Meanwhile, there have been
symptoms of Dutch disease—the REER appreciated by nearly 30 percent from mid-2009 to mid-2013
(though this has now been reversed), and non-commodity exports have performed anemically.
3.
Over the past two years, the economy has faced sharp declines in FDI and coal exports. FDI
related to OT slowed as the first phase was completed and the second phase was caught up in a
contentious dispute between the two main partners, Rio Tinto and the government. The dispute on the
country’s premier project also cast a pall on the general investment climate, which had already suffered a
blow when a moratorium on new mining exploration licenses—since reversed—was introduced in 2010.
As a result, FDI fell by half in 2013, and again in 2014. Compounding this situation were China’s slowdown
and weakness in the coal sector—prices are down almost two-thirds from their 2012 peak, and volumes
are down 8 percent—and more recently copper prices have also fallen sharply. (These declines have been
offset only partially by the decline in oil prices).
4.
In response to these shocks, the authorities resorted to expansionary policies to tide the
economy over until FDI and exports could recover. The fiscal expansion had already started in 2012
when the government implemented universal transfers to the population and the new Development Bank
of Mongolia started to promote infrastructure development. When FDI inflows tumbled and coal prices
fell in 2013, the authorities maintained expansionary fiscal policy in an effort to sustain growth as well as
boost infrastructure spending to realize the country’s potential. During 2012-14, combined on- and offbudget public capital expenditure averaged nearly 15 percent of GDP, the consolidated deficit averaged
nearly 10 percent, and debt surged to more than 75 percent of GDP, most of it external and

nonconcessional.1 Monetary policy was loosened substantially: the policy rate was cut by 275 basis
points and easing programs amounting to 20 percent of GDP were introduced (at an average cost to
banks of 4 percent while the policy rate was 10½ percent). Credit growth surged to 54 percent y/y by
end-2013, keeping GDP growth above 11 percent and the current account deficit at around 25 percent of
GDP, and sowing the seeds for banking asset-quality deterioration.
5.
The authorities’ approach soon proved unsustainable. With FDI falling, a growing share of the
current account deficit has been financed by a drawdown of reserves. From more than $4 billion (almost
6½ months of imports) in early-2013, reserves are now down to $1¼ billion (two months) even after
substantial drawing from a swap line provided by the People’s Bank of China (PBOC). The currency has
weakened against the U.S. dollar by almost 15 percent over the past year—and by more than 40 percent
since 2013—and as a result, inflation was well into double digits during most of 2014. The credit boom
has strained the financial system, with reported gross NPLs rising substantially and liquidity pressures
emerging. These developments have been noted by global markets—Mongolia has suffered sovereign
rating downgrades, and its spreads have widened sharply. Although growth has now slowed and the
current account deficit has narrowed, the overall balance of payments remains under pressure.
6.
A durable solution to Mongolia’s economic challenges requires significant macro policy
adjustment. The economy is still relatively small, and one or two developments—such as new FDI or
portfolio inflows sparked by agreements on OT-2 or TT, offers of substantial, new financing from donors,
and/or a sharp rise in commodity prices—could materially change the outlook, at least temporarily. But
such developments cannot be counted upon, and the economy would, at any rate, remain vulnerable to
future shocks. Instead, the centerpiece of any strategy to close financing gaps should be macro policies
that keep the current account deficit at a sustainably financeable level, and that strengthen the fiscal
position. Such policies would still promise prosperity, though perhaps at a somewhat slower pace, and
with reduced risks of a crisis along the way.
7.
Political conditions are now more conducive to decisive economic policymaking, but they
are still far from easy. Following a long period of uncertainty, a new government took office in
November 2014, vowing to fix the economy, and backed by a grand coalition of the major political
parties. The authorities have already taken important steps to strengthen fiscal, monetary, and other
policies, but further adjustment will be needed. The new Prime Minister’s SMS-based referendum
revealed public support for moving ahead with negotiations on large investment projects including
OT and TT, but achieving the necessary political consensus, both for these deals and for further
macro policy reforms, will remain challenging, with general elections scheduled for mid-2016.
8.
Against this backdrop, the Article IV discussions focused on policies needed to stabilize the
economy and achieve sustained growth over the medium- to long-term. Policy discussions centered

The Fiscal Stability Law, which went into effect in 2013, required that the structural on-budget fiscal deficit be kept
below 2 percent of GDP, but the government created the Development Bank of Mongolia (DBM), run by a new
Ministry of Economic Development, and channeled an extra 8 percent of GDP in capital spending through it.

on an adjustment scenario, with a package of economic and financial-sector measures to eliminate
financing gaps and stabilize the economy and banking sector. They also covered the medium-term fiscal
policy framework, policies to boost FDI and support growth, and efforts to ensure that the most
vulnerable in society are protected.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
9.
A sharp investment slowdown has dampened economic growth. Declining FDI, continued
uncertainty about OT-2, problems in the coal sector, and the contractionary impact of depreciation (see
below) have weighed on growth, which slowed from 11½ percent in 2013 to 7¾ percent last year. While
investment has fallen, consumption has remained robust, growing at nearly 9 percent, reflecting
continued loose policies. Growth is expected to slow further, to around 4 percent during 2015-17 as OT-1
enters a relatively mineral-poor layer of earth, and then pick up sharply, particularly from 2020, when OT-2
enters production. Inflation rose substantially in 2014, given currency depreciation and policy stimulus,
peaking at over 15 percent in July, and while it has since eased, it remains substantially above the target of
7 percent.
10.
While the current account deficit has narrowed, the overall BOP remains weak. Exports are
up, largely on account of OT-1, which began production in mid-2013. At the same time, equipment
imports have decreased sharply, tracking the continued decline of FDI. Other imports, however, have been
robust despite currency depreciation—mirroring the strength of consumption—and building materials are
up significantly, reflecting policy stimulus to the construction sector. Although a trade surplus was
registered in 2014, the overall BOP stayed in substantial deficit on account of service account outflows
related to OT and weak FDI. At end-2014, gross reserves at the BOM amounted to 3¼ months of imports,
equivalent to 75 percent of short-term debt, 29 percent of broad money, and 62 percent of the IMF’s riskbased metric.
11.
On existing policies, Mongolia’s external finances are expected to stay under pressure
(see baseline scenario in Tables 1–4). Exports will likely weaken for a few years as the OT project
faces unfavorable geological conditions, and imports are expected to rise on the start of OT-2
construction. There may also be difficulties in rolling over maturing public- and private-sector debts
(around $2 billion in 2017 alone, excluding the PBOC swap line which also matures that year). Given
continued easy macroeconomic policies, the current account deficit should average 15 percent of GDP
over the medium term, and staff analysis suggests the currency is overvalued by 10 to 15 percent (see
Annex II). The overall BOP is expected to remain in substantial deficit through 2017, implying continued
pressure on reserves and the exchange rate.
12.
Fiscal deficits remain large. With revenues falling short of target, the on-budget structural deficit
registered 4¼ percent of GDP in 2014, exceeding the 2 percent limit laid out in the Fiscal Stability Law
(FSL). In addition, the DBM undertook significant spending—much of it on fiscal activities such as public
infrastructure projects— outside the budget, pushing the consolidated deficit to 11 percent of GDP (see
Annex III). In 2015, a supplementary budget has brought much of the DBM’s spending on budget and
6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MONGOLIA

targets a combined deficit of 5 percent. This, however, depends on several unrealistic assumptions, and it
also excludes 2½ percent of GDP in so-called “commercial” DBM spending which should also be
considered fiscal.2 All told, the overall deficit is expected to approach 10 percent of GDP, only slightly
down from 2014. The authorities are considering additional expenditure cuts on the order of 5 percent of
GDP, and, if successful, these would move the fiscal accounts toward staff’s “adjustment scenario” (see
below).
13.
Public debt has risen sharply and is now extremely high. On the authorities’ definition—i.e., in
NPV terms, and excluding the PBOC swap drawings—debt amounted to 55 percent of GDP at end-2014,
in excess of the FSL’s 40 percent limit. Subsequent FSL amendments laid out a path to return to the
40 percent debt limit by 2018 (and to the 2 percent deficit limit as well), while the recent Debt
Management Law departed from international best practice by redefining debt to exclude state enterprise
debt and certain government guarantees. On staff’s definition—in nominal terms, and including the PBOC
swap—public debt reached 76½ percent of GDP last year (for the entire public sector, including state
enterprises) and, given ongoing deficits, is expected to peak at 92½ percent of GDP in 2017, before
declining rapidly as mining growth picks up.3 As detailed in the accompanying DSA, the key debt
indicators exceed the relevant thresholds for a few years, and Mongolia is thus assessed to be at high risk
of debt distress. At the same time, debt is not on an ever-increasing path, and it is relatively small
compared to the country’s resource wealth, if the latter can be realized.4
14.
Monetary conditions have tightened but are still too loose. Over the past year, the BOM has
hiked the policy rate by 250 basis points, to 13 percent, which is within the range suggested by a Taylorrule analysis and substantially positive in real terms.5 Reserve money growth has been close to zero,
reflecting the decline in NFA. Structural liquidity in the banking system—excess reserves on MNT deposits
plus amounts mopped up on a short-term basis—is tight. Credit growth, including securitized mortgages,
has slowed substantially (though it was still high at 23 percent y/y at end-2014). And the exchange rate
has continued to weaken, which is likely to be contractionary in an economy so dependent on imported
inputs, and where the export sector is largely dollarized. Still, growth of NDA on the BOM’s balance sheet
has been substantial, on account of increasing net credit to government as well as unconventional easing
programs, and with inflation and the BOP both remaining under pressure, further tightening is needed.

2

Project and borrower selection criteria are difficult for staff to evaluate, and given the DBM’s track record, a
cautious approach is desirable. Moreover, standard statistical principles do not allow for a portion of an agency’s
spending to be carved out and treated differently.
3

Even without OT-2—and thus with lower growth—debt would be on a declining path from 2018, as shown in an
alternate scenario in the accompanying DSA.
4

Mineral wealth—most of which, of course, has not been converted to financial wealth—has been estimated at up to
$3 trillion, which would be nearly 150 times Mongolia’s total external debt and more than 300 times its gross public
debt.
5

Because of the weakness of monetary transmission through the interest-rate channel, care should be taken in
interpreting a Taylor rule for Mongolia.

15.
As the economy has cooled, banking-system vulnerabilities have become apparent.
Banks’ balance sheets have doubled in just two years, driven by the BOM’s large stimulus programs,6
while foreign currency lending was substantial (a quarter of the banks’ loans). On the back of weak
underwriting standards, credit risks increased significantly. In 2014 nonperforming loans (NPLs) as
well as loans past-due by less than 90 days were up by 48 percent and 131 percent y/y, respectively.
Although the reported NPL ratio remains low at 3.1 percent, asset quality problems seem to be
understated especially given the inadequate classification of loan restructurings at some banks. The
real estate market is cooling, further increasing credit risk, and, as noted above, liquidity is becoming
tight. Stress tests suggest that some banks are vulnerable to economic shocks and that capital
buffers should be strengthened in recognition of the balance-sheet deterioration that has already
occurred as well as possible future deterioration given the risky environment.
16.
Risks are to the downside. Elevated BOP pressure constitutes a major threat to economic
stability. Prolonged delay of OT-2 could further undermine business confidence, slow growth, and
worsen both external and fiscal indicators. Banking-sector conditions could worsen. Externally, a
further slowdown in China could reduce Mongolia’s export demand, and surges in global volatility
could also affect Mongolia’s ability to borrow externally (see Annex IV).

Authorities’ Views
17.
The authorities agreed that the economy had gone through a difficult period because
of severe BOP shocks and argued that the policy response had stabilized the situation. Some
interlocutors argued that Mongolia had faced massive external shocks that could have led to a BOP
crisis, a credit crunch, and economic contraction. These dire outcomes, however, were avoided on
account of the countercyclical policy response, which helped the economy to achieve a “soft
landing.”
18.
As for the outlook, the authorities had a more benign view than staff. While the
baseline scenario was developed jointly by the IMF team and the technical staff of the MOF and
BOM, the authorities expected that their policy responses (see below) would be sufficient to turn the
situation around, combined with other options for managing BOP pressure, including additional
borrowing from the international market as well as donors. Finally, they noted that about 50 percent
of DBM spending, which includes the projects with government guarantees, was included in the
budget and opined that DBM commercial spending should not be included.

6

The loans under the BOM easing programs were exempted from capital charges (zero-risk weighted) and from
limits on large exposures and industry concentrations.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Macroeconomic Policies
19.
Comprehensive policy adjustment is urgently required to address external and fiscal
imbalances and stabilize the economy. Public debt is too high and inflation above target, but the
most pressing concern is the severe BOP pressure that the country continues to face. Fiscal and
monetary tightening, along with exchange-rate flexibility, is needed. Much the same advice was
offered during the 2013 Article IV consultation, with limited takeup (see Annex V). Policies on
investment, social protection, and banking also need to be strengthened.

Summary of Key Policy Recommendations
Budget / DBM

Cut consolidated deficit to 4½ percent of GDP in 2015 and to around 2 percent by 2017.
Consolidate all DBM spending into budget and strengthen DBM governance.

Monetary

Slow credit growth. Transfer unconventional easing programs to budget. Limit deficit
monetization. Strengthen BOM governance.
Keep XR flexible. Limit intervention to combating excessive volatility.
Implement structural measures to boost investment. Improve investment climate. Move
ahead with major mining projects.
Ensure protection of most vulnerable in society, including through enhanced incometargeting of subsidies.
Enhance provisions and capital. Strengthen supervisory framework. Phase out
forbearance.

The authorities have taken policy steps in the right direction, but further measures are
needed:


2015 Supplementary Budget. Facing likely revenue shortfalls, the authorities revised down
the revenue target and correspondingly cut expenditure in a 2015 supplementary budget,
passed in January. Non-commercial spending of DBM was brought on budget, and the
consolidated deficit targeted at 5 percent of GDP. This target, however, will be difficult to
reach as revenues are still over-estimated.



Amendments to Fiscal Stability Law. Recognizing that public debt had exceeded the
ceiling enshrined in the Fiscal Stability Law (FSL), the authorities in February 2015 amended
the FSL and enacted a new Debt Management Law (DML) that narrowed the coverage of
debt as previously defined in the FSL. The new legal framework also raised the debt ceiling
and set a path to bring debt (albeit more narrowly defined) and the fiscal deficit down to the
previous limits by 2018 (which will be hard to achieve on current policies).7

7

To be precise, the FSL amendments and new DML implement the following: (1) non-commercial DBM spending is
brought onto the budget and thus included in the calculation of the structural fiscal deficit; (2) structural fiscal deficit
limits are temporarily raised (5 percent of GDP in 2015, 4 percent of GDP in 2016, and 3 percent of GDP in 2017) but
kept at 2 percent of GDP for 2018 and beyond; (3) the definition of debt is narrowed from public to general
government debt (with the new definition, SOE debt and government guarantees that are fully secured by
government securities are excluded); and (4) debt limits are temporarily raised (58.3 percent in 2015, 55 percent in
2016 and 50 percent in 2017) but remain at 40 percent for 2018 and beyond.



CMAP. Parliament on February 18, 2015 approved a “Comprehensive Macro Adjustment
Plan” (CMAP), which comprises macro-financial adjustment and structural policies. CMAP
retains the target fiscal path in the supplementary budget. It envisages phasing out the
BOM’s Price Stabilization Program (PSP) and transferring remaining PSP loans to the
government. The CMAP does not, however, comprehensively transfer all of the BOM’s easing
programs—including funding for new mortgages and financial support at the request of
commercial banks for their corporate clients—to the budget. On the structural front, CMAP
calls for steps to strengthen social welfare, enhance the investment climate, facilitate FDI
inflows, promote exports, and encourage import substitution.

21.

Staff recommended a stronger package of macro policy measures, as follows:8



Fiscal policy:
A new budget amendment for 2015 would be needed to bring the consolidated
deficit (including all DBM spending) down to around 4½ percent of GDP this year.
The deficit would continue to fall until reaching around 2 percent in 2017, and it
would be possible to move toward fiscal surpluses a few years after that. (Staff
analysis does not find grounds for loosening the long-term deficit target specified in
the FSL (see Annex VI), nor do staff support the redefinition of debt in the DML.)



Within the overall budget envelope, total spending by the DBM (commercial and
non-commercial) would be limited to around 2½ percent of GDP in 2015 and would
decline thereafter. Furthermore, authority over the budget and the DBM—including
its “commercial” spending—would be unified in the Ministry of Finance, and
reporting would be consolidated. Reforms to strengthen governance of the DBM
could also be enacted.



Capital expenditures are very high in international comparison, and while part of this
is explained by existing infrastructure deficiencies and the country’s low population
density, substantial cuts nonetheless appear to be possible; moreover, given the
openness of the economy, the associated fiscal multipliers are likely to be small.



At the same time, there is scope to cut current expenditure and raise revenue: large,
untargeted subsidies should be phased out in favor of programs (like food stamps)
that more directly reach the poor. Moreover, recent growth in the public wage bill
could be addressed and procurement inefficiencies reduced. Some social benefits
could be made taxable and customs duties increased.



Going forward, a new budget law amendment could be considered to restrain
Parliament’s ability to increase the aggregate budget envelope.

Monetary policy. The stance should be tightened without delay, including by restricting
deficit monetization, and credit growth should be further slowed, following the harmful
credit boom in recent years (see Annex VI). The BOM’s unconventional programs (PSP,

MONGOLIA

mortgages, and financial support at the request of commercial banks for their corporate
clients) should be transferred to the budget, where—in a transparent manner and with
Parliamentary oversight—they can compete with other spending priorities for limited
resources. The nature of BOM operations should change—unconventional easing programs
targeting particular industries or providing financial support at the request of commercial
banks for their corporate clients should be ruled out, while open market operations may
need to be enhanced to ensure sufficient liquidity in the banking system. Further BOM
governance reforms should also be considered, such as giving Monetary Policy Committee
members a vote on BOM decisions.


Exchange rate flexibility. The BOM would limit its involvement in FX markets to preventing
excessive market volatility, and as a result, the exchange rate would move more flexibly. The
strategy is to contain further sharp depreciation through adequate macro policies, and to
limit intervention to addressing excessive volatility.

22.
These policy efforts would help stabilize the economy, but reserve buffers would
remain thin, suggesting the need for additional financing. As shown in Tables 5-9 and Figure 5,
growth in this adjustment scenario would slow somewhat in 2015 given the policy tightening, and
inflation would rise by a moderate amount for several years, given exchange-rate pass-through. The
fiscal adjustment would also put public debt on a more sustainable path. Imports would moderate,
and strengthened policies would support market confidence and facilitate rollovers of several large
bonds maturing in 2015 and 2017 (a total exceeding $2 billion).9 As a result, foreign-exchange
reserves would stabilize at around 1¾ months of imports for several years (before rising in 2019–
20). This is substantially stronger than in the baseline but still lower than desirable, suggesting the
need for additional financing in support of the adjustment effort.
23.
Looking ahead, prudent macroeconomic management must be maintained to ensure
that resource wealth can be harnessed effectively. Many resource-rich countries have failed to
realize the promise of prosperity. Avoiding procyclical fiscal policy, saving resource revenues and
investing them wisely, ensuring cautious monetary policy, and maintaining a competitive exchange
rate to avoid the effects of Dutch Disease, are all essential components.10 Mongolia has a relatively
large resource endowment compared to some other resource-rich economies, and managing that
wealth wisely is of critical importance.

Authorities’ Views
24.
The authorities saw the benefits of additional fiscal adjustment. They agreed that the
fiscal path in the supplementary budget and CMAP faced risks and that further measures were thus
needed. They expressed their intention to cut budget spending further via a government resolution,
supported by another supplementary budget later in the year, and to reduce DBM spending as well,
with total cuts amounting to around 5 percent of GDP. They also saw an important role for
additional financing to bridge short-term BOP difficulties.
9

The current account deficit narrows in dollar terms relative to the baseline scenario; but since the adjustment lowers
GDP, the CAD in percent of GDP rises. Also, the CAD still worsens for a few years within the adjustment scenario, on
account of OT’s geological conditions and the start of OT-2 construction.

The authorities broadly shared staff’s views on monetary policy going forward. The
BOM noted that they had intentionally been phasing out their unconventional programs, and the
government also expressed its agreement with this objective. The BOM envisaged transferring the
outstanding program loans to the government by end-June. They noted that the Price Stabilization
Program had basically achieved its goals, as supply-driven inflation had continuously been low and
stable over the past 26 months, and the economy had achieved a soft landing. They continued to
see the mortgage program as highly beneficial, noting that it aimed to make households’
expenditures more efficient and to boost middle-class savings. They believed that this program
should be continued as part of the government’s long-term saving policy, in conjunction with
ongoing structural reforms of the pension fund. Finally, they suggested that it would be more
appropriate to consider changes to the central bank law only after economic conditions had
improved. On exchange rate policy, they noted that they are fully committed to the flexible
exchange rate regime.

B. Structural Reforms and Social Policies
26.
Structural measures are needed to boost investment and growth, and an enhanced
effort is needed to protect the poor. To return the economy to a sustainable, rapid growth path, a
focused effort is needed to improve the investment climate, which was harmed by previous policy
changes, boost FDI, and move ahead with large mining projects. Many of these are included in the
authorities’ CMAP. Given resource constraints, subsidy programs should be targeted better to
protect the poorest and most vulnerable in society.
27.
The authorities are redoubling efforts to boost investment. The CMAP, now approved by
Parliament, includes reaching agreement on OT and TT as key goals, and a former prime minister
has been appointed minister in charge of “mega projects,” charged with moving those negotiations
forward. The government has also proposed a host of measures—under the CMAP and through
other initiatives—to increase investment, boost exports, and support appropriate import
substitution. Finally, the tax law is being amended to improve clarity and avoid conflicts in the
judicial system with foreign investors.
28.
Special efforts must be made to ensure that the most vulnerable in society are
adequately protected. Compared to other similarly placed countries, Mongolia has a large budget
for subsidies and transfers, amounting to some 8 percent of GDP. Most of these are targeted to
different categories of the population—mothers, children, the elderly, the disabled, et al.—without
regard to income. Economic adjustment policies, while necessary for medium-term growth and
stability, will create short-term dislocations, and it is vital that policies be designed to protect the
poor. In the short-term, the income-targeted food stamp program could be expanded, and looking
forward, the proxy means-tested subsidy programs currently under design should be implemented
expeditiously. The World Bank has done significant work in this area (see Informational Annex), and
there exists sufficient technical capacity to improve targeting.

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MONGOLIA

Authorities’ Views
29.
The authorities noted that, as a policy matter, income targeting of subsidies is
controversial in Mongolia. They had proposed this in the first supplementary budget for 2015, but
Parliament rejected many of the relevant measures. Cultural values prioritize children and the
elderly, regardless of income level. That said, they firmly agreed on the need to protect the poorest,
which may require difficult choices given hard budget constraints.

C. Financial Sector
30.
A comprehensive approach to addressing problems in the banking system is needed to
contain systemic risks. The BOM has taken some good steps, but more needs to be done (and the
IMF stands ready to support the authorities with further TA, as needed). Risk weights for unhedged
FX loans were increased in August 2014, and the 1-percent general provision for performing loans
was restored, though only for new loans. Nevertheless, loan classification is heavily reliant on days
overdue rather than on more qualitative assessments of borrowers’ creditworthiness and future cash
flows, while the prudential treatment of restructured loans is weak. The banking system has already
seen balance-sheet deterioration, and it remains vulnerable to a further deterioration of economic
conditions and the crystallization of hidden losses.
31.
As a priority, provisioning and capital buffers need to be reinforced (see Annex VII for a
detailed list of banking-sector recommendations). The level of provisions (70 percent of NPLs)
appears to be low given the likely understatement of NPLs, the inadequate treatment of loan
restructuring, the uncertain value of recoveries (certain Civil Code provisions make foreclosures
difficult, and there is significant uncertainty regarding the valuation of collateral, and the cooling of
the real estate market. Thus, current capital levels (e.g., a system-wide Tier 1 ratio of 12.5 percent)
are likely overstated. The BOM should take immediate measures to increase provisions and capital
across the banking system, and particularly for the most vulnerable banks. This could usefully be
informed by an independent asset quality review of the major banks.
32.
The BOM should eliminate forbearance and strengthen risk recognition. Assetclassification and provisioning regulations should be enhanced by introducing a stricter treatment
and regular reporting of restructured loans. The rules should also be changed to embed more
qualitative and forward-looking assessments of the borrower’s condition, including hedging capacity
against foreign-exchange risk. The 1-percent general provision should apply to the entire stock of
performing loans, and the BOM should discontinue forbearance vis-à-vis loans made under the
Price Stabilization Program (PSP). Capital requirements for systemically important banks should be
raised—the Tier 1 ratio should be increased to 10.5 percent—and targeted additional capital
requirements should be imposed on banks that have large concentrations (loan, deposit, and
foreign exchange). The BOM should move quickly to resolve non-viable banks, if needed.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

MONGOLIA

33.
The supervisory and the crisis preparedness frameworks need to be strengthened.
Legislative changes are needed to secure for the BOM flexible powers for early intervention. Current
supervisory assessments (CAMELS) should be turned into robust and forward-looking tools for early
identification of risks and prompt corrective action. Finally, the Supervisory Committee should be
empowered as the key decision maker. Cooperation on financial stability and crisis preparedness
matters should be strengthened via the Financial Stability Council, which should be expanded to
include the Deposit Insurance Corporation. The legal framework should prevent the reversal of
resolution actions and provide early and flexible intervention triggers as well as better safeguards
against misuse of public funding. Emergency liquidity assistance should be provided only to solvent
and viable banks, and should be priced at penalty rates.
34.
AML/CFT. In 2011, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) designated Mongolia as a
jurisdiction not making sufficient progress in implementing the agreed action plan to enhance its
Anti-Money-Laundering / Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) framework. Since then,
with the support of ongoing IMF TA, Mongolia has strengthened its framework considerably, and it
is no longer subject to the FATF’s on-going global AML/CFT compliance process.

Authorities’ Views
35.
The authorities welcomed staff’s suggestions on strengthening the banking system.
They considered that the recent tightening of policies, including in the area of prudential
regulations, would help contain the risks in the banking system. Looking ahead, the BOM agreed
that further policy attention should be devoted to monitoring and pre-emptively responding to
potential risks in the banking sector, and welcomed the recommendations of the recent Fund TA
mission, which could be integrated into the Medium Term Supervisory Strategy.

D. Other Issues
36.
Article VIII. There are two previously identified multiple currency practices, relating to the
BOM’s calculation and use of reference exchange rates. No action is planned.

STAFF APPRAISAL
37.
Mongolia has a bright future, but the next few years will be challenging. If managed
prudently, the country’s massive resource wealth could spell prosperity for all Mongolians, nearly
one-third of whom still live below the poverty line. These are not just fond hopes for a distant
future; it could be as early as 2020 that OT-2’s exports begin, boosting GDP dramatically and
generating fiscal revenues to transform the economy, improve living standards, and build up an
endowment for future generations. In light of its resource wealth, and assuming this can continue
gradually to be realized, Mongolia is projected to be solvent given the strong projected revenues
from mining over the long term. The country does, however, face serious liquidity pressures and

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MONGOLIA

risks in the short run, before mining inflows ramp up. Until then, financing outsized prospective
fiscal and BOP deficits will be difficult.
38.
Loose macro policies have helped create the difficulties the economy faces today.
Mongolia’s present problems were driven in large part by major external shocks, to FDI and to coal
exports. But policy errors also contributed. Policies were loosened first to share the benefits of
prospective mineral wealth broadly, and then to buffer the economy from shocks. This succeeded—
for a while—in maintaining high growth, but at the cost of exacerbating economic and financial
vulnerabilities. Fiscal discipline was undermined by large off-budget spending, and monetary policy
was eased dramatically. This stimulus fueled inflation, compounded BOP pressure, laid the seeds for
asset-quality problems in the banking system, and generally undermined confidence at home and
abroad.
39.
Policy adjustment is needed to provide a sustainable solution to Mongolia’s economic
challenges. Macro policies need to be tightened to keep current account deficits at more
manageable levels and to improve the fiscal position. If additional external financing can be
marshaled in support of such policies, the adjustment will be less disruptive. At the same time,
measures are needed to strengthen the banking system, and it is vital that steps be taken to
improve the targeting of subsidies and thus ensure protection of the most vulnerable in society.
40.
The authorities have already taken a number of steps to strengthen the economy. Part
of DBM’s spending has been brought on budget, and the consolidated fiscal deficit is expected to
decline this year. A government resolution to cut spending administratively is envisaged, to be
backed up by a second supplementary budget later in the year. The BOM has hiked the policy rate
twice, slowed the pace of PSP and mortgage lending, and proposed transferring the existing stock
of program loans to the government’s balance sheet. The authorities have redoubled efforts to
reach agreement with investors on large projects and introduced other structural measures to boost
exports and reduce imports. Steps have been taken to strengthen the banks and to improve bank
supervision and crisis preparedness.
41.

More, however, is needed:



The fiscal path needs to be secured with Parliamentary approval for measures to control
spending, both on-budget and off, as part of a coherent, medium-term macro framework.



The BOM should cease unconventional easing programs targeting particular industries or
providing financial support at the request of commercial banks for their corporate clients,
and should instead return to traditional central-banking functions; these programs should, if
desired, by conducted by the government, competing with other spending priorities for
funds within the budget.



The monetary stance should be tightened further, to control credit growth and support the
BOP.
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

MONGOLIA



Foreign-exchange intervention should be limited to dealing with episodes of excessive
volatility, and the exchange rate should be allowed to move flexibly.



Banks’ provisions and capital buffers should be bolstered, informed by an independent
asset-quality review, and supervisory and crisis-preparedness frameworks enhanced.



DBM and BOM governance should be strengthened.



The investment climate should be enhanced, and progress made on mega-mining projects,
so as to boost FDI.



Especially important, social safety nets should be strengthened and better targeted.

42.
With a comprehensive adjustment strategy in place, Mongolia will be well placed to
realize its economic potential. Today’s challenges are serious but surmountable, and the country’s
medium-term prospects remain strong. With prudent management, Mongolia should be able to
raise adequate external financing in support of its adjustment policies and build reserve buffers,
while safeguarding external and public debt sustainability.

Annex I. Economic Impact of Mongolia’s Natural Resource Endowments
Mongolia is unusually rich in mineral resources. The population of 3 million inhabits a country
with an estimated $1 to $3 trillion worth of copper, gold, coal, oil, and other resources, close to
growing markets in China and elsewhere in Asia. To exploit these reserves, Mongolia has in the last
several years attracted very large FDI inflows into the sector that now accounts for around 20 percent
of GDP and close to 90 percent of exports. Joint ventures between Mongolian companies (both
public and private) and multinationals account for a significant proportion of mining production.
Currently almost all production is for export, and transport links—especially with China—are being
substantially improved, which will allow unit costs to be reduced. A number of mega projects are
underway that will significantly boost the mining sector and catalyze other investments. These
include:
A.


The Oyu Tolgoi copper and gold mine
Mongolia is on track to become a globally significant copper and gold producer, with the
Oyu Tolgoi (OT) mine one of the largest in the world. The project is jointly owned by the
Government of Mongolia (34 percent stake) and Turquoise Hill Resources (THR). Rio Tinto
has a 50 percent stake in THR and is the project manager. The first-phase open-pit mine
began construction in 2010 with investment exceeding $6 billion, and production
commenced in 2013. The second phase (OT-2) will be underground, and output will markedly
increase once production comes on stream toward the end of this decade (associated FDI
inflows are estimated at over $5 billion).



The commencement of the OT-2 project has been delayed by ongoing negotiations between
Rio Tinto and the authorities over a number of issues. These include the appropriate
treatment of significant cost overruns in OT-1, resolution of outstanding tax issues, the exact
specification of activities, government permits, and a number of social and environment
issues. However, both sides have stated that they remain committed to the project, with the
intention for the project to commence in 2015.

B.


Tavan Tolgoi (TT) coal mine
Coal reserves are estimated at well over 6 billion tons. Mongolia is already a major exporter
of coal to China for both power generation and for use in the heavy industrial sector; South
Gobi Resources (in which THR has a 47.9 per cent interest) and Energy Resources (a
subsidiary of the Mongolian Mining Corporation (MMC)) are major producers currently.
Production is set to increase sharply with the commencement of the TT coal mine. The tender
has been won by a consortium that includes leading Mongolian, Chinese and Japanese
companies (MMC, Shenhua Energy, and Sumitomo Corporation, respectively). Negotiations
on the production modalities are reported to be at an advanced stage.



The total investment in TT is expected to be $4 billion. The business model is based on the
export of coal to China and third countries, with the value added increased through more
domestic processing including washing and power generation. Related investments also

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MONGOLIA

include a new railway that will substantially improve export potential and a new power
station that will supply power to OT and also to China.
The continued development of the mining sector will have a number of important
macroeconomic implications.


Growth and development. Mongolian extraction costs are among the lowest in the world,
meaning that the sector should be relatively unscathed from current price falls and may
benefit as marginal producers exit. And while logistics have traditionally been a challenge in
this landlocked nation, transport links—especially with China—are being substantially
improved, notably through the construction of a new railway. Mining exports to third
countries will also benefit from recent agreement on duty-free access to Chinese ports. Over
time, the intention is for more value-added processing to take place in Mongolia, creating
potential for local employment growth and supporting the outlook for GDP.



Supporting the external position. Resource wealth promises prosperity in the long run, but
also substantial dividends in the next five years. OT-1 brought $6 billion of investment into a
$10 billion economy over just a few years, during which time Mongolia was one of the
world’s fastest growing economies. That first phase went into production last year and led to
a 30 percent y/y increase in mining exports. OT-2 would bring in another $5 billion in FDI
over the next few years. It would start production within a few years, and even on
conservative projections, mineral exports would increase by another 25 percent.



Strong mining prospects imply a fairly rapid improvement in fiscal and external
imbalances. From 2017 to 2020, rapid growth would bring the public debt ratio down
sharply, from 92½ percent of GDP to 80 percent. While loans to Rio Tinto would have to be
repaid, the fiscal balance could possibly move toward surplus and facilitate the accumulation
of wealth for future generations in a planned sovereign wealth fund. The current account
deficit is projected to narrow to just 6 percent of GDP in 2020, and pressure on reserves
would steadily disappear. While this outlook would be less favorable if OT-2 remains
undeveloped, macroeconomic imbalances would still be reduced substantially.

An important implication is that the national balance sheet will be strengthened as these
resources are extracted. While Mongolia presently faces an acute liquidity problem, accompanied
by sovereign stress, it is solvent given the strong projected revenues from mining over the long term.
Assuming the commencement of the large projects in 2015, the impact on GDP growth and external
accounts will allow debt to start to decline sharply after 2017. (And even without OT-2, debt would
still decline from 2018, albeit more slowly.)

Annex II. External Sector and Exchange Rate Assessment
Mongolia’s external position is weaker than desirable, and the togrog overvalued by 10 - 15 percent.
Balance of Payments, Exchange Rate Movements, and Reserve Adequacy
 The balance of payments has continued to face pressure. Despite substantial borrowing from
abroad, GIR fell from 4 months of imports at end-2013 to around 2 months at end-February 2015.
 The nominal exchange rate depreciated by 14 percent in 2014, and while the REER initially
Reserves Adequacy Under Different Approaches
depreciated somewhat, it later appreciated strongly, reflecting
(In months of imports)
still high inflation and the BOM’s FX intervention.

7.0

 By almost all indicators, gross reserves are too low—below
the traditional 3-months-of-imports benchmark, below the
“Greenspan-Guidotti” rule suggesting 100 percent coverage of
short-term debt, and only just above 20 percent of broad
money. And according to the IMF’s risk-based metric, the
optimal range of reserves is 4½ to 7 months of import cover.1

Estimate of Current Account Gap and Exchange Rate Misalignment
 Methodology. This assessment adopts the External Balance Assessment-lite (EBA-lite) approach
for frontier economies in addition to the External Sustainability (ES) and Equilibrium Real Exchange
Rate (ERER) approaches in the CGER framework. The EBA-lite methodology has been developed as a
successor to the macro balance approach used under CGER. One key difference is that EBA-lite
makes a sharper distinction between a positive (descriptive) understanding of current accounts and
real exchange rates and normative evaluations. Another is that EBA-lite takes into account a much
broader set of factors—including policies, cyclical conditions, and global capital market conditions—
that may influence the current account and real exchange rate. As before, the ES approach measures
the exchange rate adjustment needed to sustain a certain level of net foreign assets of the economy;
the ERER approach is based on empirical studies of the exchange rate that would be consistent with
the economy’s productivity, fiscal soundness, external position, and other factors.
 Result. According to the EBA-lite approach, Mongolia’s current account deficit is 4 percent of
GDP above the level consistent with desirable policies. This implies overvaluation of 11 percent. The
External Sustainability approach points to a current account gap of 6 percent, indicating real
overvaluation of 13 percent. The ERER approach implies an overvaluation of 14 percent.

For Mongolia, one should arguably focus only on non-mining imports (half the total), as mining imports come with their own FDI
financing. From this perspective, the optimal range would be 2¼ to 3½ months of total imports, but being high in that range is
advisable given the volatility of the mining sector, the extent of deposit dollarization, and the need to boost market confidence to
facilitate debt rollovers in 2017/18

Annex III. Development Bank of Mongolia
The Development Bank of Mongolia (DBM) was established in 2011 as a state-owned, for-profit legal
entity with the specific functions of conducting activities aimed at financing major projects and
programs for the long-term development of Mongolia. One of the stated rationales is that domestic
commercial banks have relatively high financing cost and their small sizes impose limits on the
maximum amount of loans that can be granted to any single project.
Financing. Nearly all DBM financing is either directly provided by the government or obtained
through external borrowings that are fully guaranteed by the government. In addition to its equity
contribution, the government has also transferred the proceeds of the 2012 sovereign “Chinggis
bond” to finance DBM operations. Though DBM hopes to borrow in the future on the strength of its
own balance sheet, so far all of its bond issuances and loans have been government guaranteed. This
includes the $580 million DBM bond in 2012, the JPY 30 billion samurai bond in 2013, a $162 million
loan from China Development Bank, and a $300 million syndicated loan from Credit Suisse in 2014.
Spending. DBM broadly classifies its projects into two groups: those that are repayable from the
state budget (i.e., non-commercial projects), and those that are self-financing, or commercial. The
non-commercial projects include roads and other infrastructure and are implemented through line
ministries, while the commercial projects include power plants, railway, aviation, housing finance,
mining, housing construction, agriculture, light industry, and construction materials. The relative
share of these two types of projects varies by year: in 2013, commercial projects accounted for
around one-third of the total DBM spending; the share increased to nearly 60 percent in 2014; and it
is expected to decline again, to less than half, in 2015. The projects DBM undertakes typically require
parliament and government approval, and there is no clear link between the sources of financing and
the types of projects.
Statistical treatment. International statistical manuals (GFSM 2014, SNA 2008 and BPM6), suggest
an “institutional unit” approach under which all activities of an institutional unit should be allocated
to one and only one institutional sector. In this case, all activities of DBM should be included in the
(general) government sector since the majority of its activities are non-commercial/government in
nature. In limited circumstances, international statistical manuals allow for commercial or market
activities of general government units to be split out, but such “quasi-corporations” should be well
defined units themselves, with separate accounts, separate management, and full autonomy of
operation. The current commercial activities of DBM clearly do not satisfy these conditions.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most
likely to materialize, in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment
of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a
probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability of 30 percent or more). The RAM reflects staff views
on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutuallyexclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.

Annex V. Implementation of Past IMF Recommendations
The authorities have agreed on the need for policy adjustment and responded to some of the
recommendations made in past Article IV consultations.
Key recommendation
Fiscal Policy
Tighten fiscal policy so as to bring deficit
gradually down to FSL limit.

Maintain the long-term debt limit of
40 percent of GDP and gradually bring debt
ratio down to this level.

Monetary Policy
Phase out unconventional easing programs at
the BOM.

Tighten monetary policy

Maintain exchange rate flexibility

Implementation

The authorities targeted to keep the on-budget
deficit below the FSL limit, but off-budget
spending by DBM has been large. They recently
brought DBM’s noncommercial spending onto the
budget, and aim to reduce the deficit to 2 percent
of GDP by 2018.
The authorities amended FSL and passed a new
Debt Management Law (DML), loosening the
definition of debt, temporarily raising debt limit,
and setting a downward debt trajectory towards
the original limit.

The BOM phased out its deposits at commercial
banks and scaled back PSP lending. It plans to
continue implementing the mortgage program,
though at a slower rate. Meanwhile, the BOM
introduced a program to provide financial support
at the request of commercial banks for their
corporate clients in late 2014.
BOM raised the policy rate twice in the past six
months and, as noted above, committed to
slowing its easing programs.
The nominal exchange rate depreciated by
14 percent in 2014, though the REER appreciated
strongly in late 2014, reflecting still high inflation
and the BOM’s FX intervention.

Financial Policy
Strengthen bank supervision, restrict FX loans
to unhedged borrowers, and increase loan
provisions.

36

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Fund TA on bank supervision provided specific
recommendations on bank supervision, which the
BOM welcomed. The BOM raised risk weights for
FX loans in 2014 and introduced a definition of
“hedged” borrowers for prudential purposes. BOM
also introduced a 1 percent general provision for
newly issued performing loans.

Annex VI. Summaries of Background Analytical Work
A. Analyzing Alternative Fiscal Paths for Mongolia1
This paper uses a simple spreadsheet-based approach to analyze different long-term fiscal paths for
Mongolia and shed light on the country’s appropriate deficit and debt targets. It concludes that the
country should be running small surpluses and that there is no justification to adjust the FSL’s targets
on a permanent basis.
1.
There has been considerable public debate about the right fiscal targets for Mongolia.
Short-term balance of payment pressures clearly suggests the need for consolidation, and good
budgetary practice suggests that DBM spending should be brought on budget. But should the
consolidated deficit be brought down to the FSL’s target of 2 percent of GDP, or is this too tight to
permit needed infrastructure investment? Also under debate is the appropriate debt limit—is the
FSL’s threshold of 40 percent of GDP too restrictive?
2.
This paper applies some basic fiscal concepts for resource-rich economies. The
permanent-income hypothesis (PIH) would suggest that revenues from exhaustible resources be
shared equally with future generations, either in terms of constant dollars per capita, or in terms of a
share of nonmineral GDP. But with current generations poorer than future ones, and thus likely to
have a higher marginal utility of consumption, a modified PIH (MPIH) framework, which allows some
frontloading of consumption and then a payback period of larger fiscal surpluses later, may be more
attractive. It is also possible to take a broader perspective, and instead of focusing solely on the
consumption-savings decision, to also consider the possibility of investment. Under the so-called
“Fiscal Stability Framework” (FSF), spending can be frontloaded to develop infrastructure, and
depending on the rate-of-return, the extent to which future fiscal surpluses are needed can be
reduced or eliminated, without compromising future generations’ welfare. The paper simulates fiscal
paths for Mongolia under these three different frameworks using a spreadsheet template developed
in conjunction with the 2012 Board papers on resource-rich developing countries.2
3.
Under reasonable parameter values, the PIH prescribes that Mongolia should currently
be running a small fiscal surplus. Table A1 summarizes a sensitivity analysis showing the
appropriate fiscal balance for different assumptions about the value of Mongolia’s mineral wealth,
the rate at which minerals prices rise, and the government’s tax take from the sector. As shown in the
highlighted row, if mineral wealth is $1½ trillion, prices grow at 3 percent (broadly in line with
historical averages), and the government earns 20 percent of exports in taxes, then delivering an
equal share of nonmineral GDP to all generations would require a primary surplus this year of nearly
5 percent of GDP. This translates to an overall surplus of 2 percent of GDP. Even if the most optimistic
parameters are chosen (wealth of $3 trillion, price growth of 5 percent, and a revenue take of
25 percent), the overall deficit should be no more than 3 percent of GDP. According to this analysis,

MONGOLIA

Mongolia’s current consolidated deficit of 10 percent of GDP is far out of line, and, most likely, even
the 2 percent of GDP deficit allowed by the FSL is too large.
4.
An appeal to the MPIH framework does not change the conclusion that Mongolia’s
fiscal stance is currently too loose. The top-right chart in Figure A1 presents alternative paths for
the overall fiscal balance over time. While the PIH requires a surplus for the next fifty years or so
(when resource revenues are strong) and a deficit only thereafter, it is possible to construct an MPIH
path that features the 10 percent deficits that are currently observed; however, as shown in Figure
A1, to allow such frontloaded consumption, the next generation would need to run substantially
tighter fiscal policy to compensate—an unrealistic intergenerational social contract.
5.
Neither does the conclusion change under the FSF framework. Observed deficits stem
largely from heavy infrastructure spending, rather than from handouts/consumption. If spending is
indeed devoted to investment, then no future payback period is needed under the FSF paths, and
indeed, lifetime wealth is higher. However, even if it is assumed that the return on investment for
infrastructure projects that are properly selected and managed could reach 25 percent in Mongolia,
reflecting its pressing infrastructure needs, constraints on both absorptive capacity and capacity to
borrow would substantially lower this return when spending is as high as observed in the past few
years. As a result, an FSF path with more moderate frontloading is shown to deliver similar
consumption (primary, current expenditure) but higher wealth for every generation.
6.
Finally, even if there were a justification for temporarily running large deficits,
permanent FSL limits should not be adjusted. As shown in Figure A1, while certain constellations
of parameters may support a path of heavy upfront investment, it would soon be expected that the
fiscal balance would turn to substantial surplus, permitting the buildup of a large sovereign wealth
fund. In other words, the fiscal deficit will naturally evolve over the lifecycle of the mines. The FSL,
however, sets a single deficit limit for every year. This should not be loosened for all years just to
permit a (hopefully) short-lived increase in deficits. Similarly, there appears to be little justification for
raising the gross debt limit of 40 percent of GDP. As wealth is accumulated, there may still be a need
for some gross debt, in order to allow fiscal maneuverability, but this would presumably be a small
amount.

B. A Sustainable Public Investment Path for Mongolia: A Model-Based Analysis3
This paper complements the first by looking at optimal fiscal paths, but using an entirely different
methodology. Rather than a spreadsheet-based analysis focused on fiscal variables alone, this paper
offers results from a DSGE model tailored to resource-rich economies. This permits an investigation of
the implications of different fiscal policies for key fiscal and non-fiscal variables such as debt,
consumption, investment, and the real exchange rate. This paper also finds that fiscal consolidation is
needed and that the FSL limits should not be adjusted.
7.
This paper adopts a structural model-based analysis to help assess policy decisions
regarding the management of natural resources in Mongolia. The study uses a dynamic
stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model with natural resource wealth in a small open economy.
The model combines elements of frameworks developed in Araujo et al. (2013), Buffie et al. (2012),
Berg et al. (2013), and Melina et al. (2013), in analyzing natural resource management for developing
countries. The DIGNAR toolkit is used to analyze various public investment plans in Mongolia. The
model captures the investment-growth nexus as well as investment efficiencies and absorptive
capacity constraints.4 It thus helps to inform the authorities about the tradeoffs involved in investing
resource revenues to boost growth while maintaining fiscal sustainability and macroeconomic
stability.
8.
The model captures the key features of resource-rich developing countries and is
carefully tailored to Mongolia’s particular circumstances. It features two types of households,
including poor households with no access to financial markets, and includes traded and non-traded
sectors as well as a natural-resource sector. Public capital, subject to inefficiencies and absorptive
capacity constraints, enters production functions in both the traded and non-traded sectors. The
government has access to different types of debt (concessional, domestic, and external commercial)
and a resource fund, which can be used to finance public investment plans. The resource fund can
also serve as a buffer to absorb fluctuations of fiscal balances for given projections of resource
revenues and public investment plans. Fiscal adjustments through tax rates and government noncapital expenditures—which may be constrained by ceilings and floors, respectively—may be
triggered to maintain debt sustainability. The model is calibrated using historical data for Mongolia
and parameters widely accepted in the literature.
9.
The model is estimated under two different public investment paths. Under a fiscal
consolidation path, the government restrains public investment so as to manage the debt. The
aggressive investment path, by contrast, maintains currently observed investment levels to develop
infrastructure and boost growth.
10.
Since uncertainty and volatility are intrinsic to resource economies, the public
investment paths are each analyzed under a baseline scenario and an adverse scenario.



Baseline scenario: Copper mining production is estimated to increase from 0.2 million tons in
2013 to around 1 million tons by 2020, when the second phase of OT goes into production. It
is also assumed that political constraints make it impossible to increase consumption or labor
taxes, and the government thus relies on external commercial borrowing.



Adverse scenario: Resource revenues are hit by a negative shock—e.g., a further delay in OT2, or a drop in copper prices similar to that observed in 2009.

11.
As shown in Figure A2, the aggressive investment path substantially increases fiscal
risk. While it yields faster growth than under fiscal consolidation, it also implies that public debt—
and external, commercial debt in particular—rises substantially. And the situation is even worse if the
adverse scenario obtains. Finally, rapid investment will quickly lead to investment inefficiencies (poor
planning, higher-than-expected costs, bad governance, supply bottlenecks, lack of complementary
infrastructure, etc.), further underscoring the need for fiscal restraint.
12.
The aggressive investment path would also put pressure on the external sector. As
shown in Figure A3, the togrog is currently overvalued and should be allowed to depreciate.
Aggressive government investment would lead to overheating, bid up the relative price of
nontradables, widen the current account deficit, and impede the pace of the required real
depreciation.
13.
In sum, a DSGE-model-based analysis confirms earlier findings that frontloaded fiscal
consolidation is needed. The analysis in this paper stresses the benefits of adopting a
comprehensive approach to enhancing absorptive capacity, managing natural resource wealth in a
way that avoids Dutch disease, and sustaining the longer-term diversification of growth. In Mongolia,
given the nontrivial role of the natural resources sector, it is particularly important to look beyond
traditional metrics of investment pace. While the ambitious scaling up of public investment can
generate higher non-mineral growth, it can also pose substantial challenges to debt sustainability
and macroeconomic stability.

Mongolia has seen strong credit growth in
2011-2013. Credit grew by an average of 50 percent
per year during 2011–13. In 2013, the strong growth
was driven mostly by construction and real-estate
loans, largely as a result of the central bank’s easing
programs. This led the banking sector’s loan-to-deposit
ratio to rise to 123 percent and the credit-to-GDP ratio
to 57 percent in 2013. In 2014, credit growth
decelerated, but the credit-GDP ratio rose further to
61 percent.

Sources: Mongolian Authority

15.
This paper analyzes whether the strong credit growth constitutes “a bad credit boom”
and discusses the risks of such a boom.6 The paper takes a three-step approach. It first assesses
the medium-term trend of credit, using various filtering techniques.7 The second step is to calculate
the “credit gap” obtaining from the difference between the actual credit and the medium term trend.
Finally, it looks at whether the credit could represent a “bad” credit boom by estimating credit gap
with respect to certain threshold.8 The paper also uses the direct approach found in Dell’Ariccia and
others (2012), where a 20 percent annual increase in the credit-to-GDP ratio is taken as the threshold
of natural credit increase.
16.
The estimation concludes that Mongolia experienced harmful credit booms in 2011
and 2013. In 2013, credit exceeded its threshold in all methodologies, with equilibrium credit in 2013
estimated at around 50 to 55 percent of GDP. Similarly, Mongolia experienced a credit boom in 2011
of about 3 to 5 percent of GDP higher than the appropriate levels. In 2014, credit (including
mortgage-backed securities) remained above the threshold level.

Given cross country data availability, the panel estimation employs the 2000–13 data series.

7

One method is to use a rolling Hodrick-Prescott (HP) filter to find the potential and long-term credit-GDP trend (as
applied by BIS (2010), Borio and Lowe (2002), Borio and Drehman (2009) as well as Hilbers and others (2006)). A
second method follows Mendoza and Terrones (2008), who also applied the HP filter, but using the whole sample
period rather than a rolling sample period. The third method (backward-looking, rolling, and cubic trend) is taken
from Dell’Ariccia and others (2012). Finally, Gersl and Seidler (2011) use economic fundamentals to estimate the
equilibrium credit-GDP ratio.
8

Gersl and Seidler (2001) and BIS (2010) use the absolute credit gap about 2 percent of GDP as threshold, while Borio
and Lowe (2002) use 4 percent of GDP. Others use relative credit gap to its long term trend and set 5 percent as the
threshold credit gap (see Gourinchas and others, 2001 and Hilbers and others, 2005).

The Mongolian credit boom in 2013 was higher than in other peer countries in the
region. Cross country data show that the Mongolian credit gap in 2013 was bigger than those of
other countries in the region. The finding remains relevant when the credit gap is compared to
historical levels of peer income countries in the region, except Indonesia and Lao PDR (Figure 3).

Various country experiences also show that prolonged credit booms can lead to
banking crises and substantial output losses. Laeven and Valencia (2013) documented the impact
of banking crises on output, debt, and asset quality. Hilbers and others (2005) pointed out that the
cost of a credit boom to the economy will depend on the nature of credit, the rate of credit growth,
the main providers of credit, the main borrowers, the sectoral loan composition, the currency
composition of loans, and the maturity of loans.

The policy implications are clear: credit should be managed properly to sustain the
economy without risking a crisis. Among others, Dell’Ariccia and others (2012) summarize the
major policy recommendations to deal with credit booms. These include fiscal, monetary, and
macroprudential tools. Policy coordination across different authorities and across borders may also
need to be strengthened.

Annex VII. Policy Agenda for Strengthening the Banking Sector
Important legal and regulatory reforms have been passed, but bank supervision needs further
upgrading. A recent TA mission outlined priority actions, as follows:
Improve the accuracy of risk recognition and management
Restructured loans should be subject to a stricter prudential treatment and reported on a regular basis to
the BOM (ST—within 18 months).
The 1-percent general provision coefficient should apply to the entire stock of performing loans (ST).
Discontinue the current explicit regulatory forbearance vis-à-vis the loans provided under the PSP (ST).
Implement a more structured and forward-looking assessment of the borrower’s condition, including its
hedging capacity against foreign exchange risks (ST).
Perform a comprehensive asset quality review to assess comprehensively the real condition of the loan
portfolio of banks (ST).
Strengthen the resilience of banks
Increase the Tier 1 capital for SIBs to 10.5 percent from the current 9 percent (ST).
Require targeted capital increases (Pillar 2 - like) in the banks that have high-risk profiles due to borrower,
depositor, and foreign currency concentrations (ST).
Increase the intensity of supervisory oversight of the vulnerable banks (ST).
Introduce a capital countercyclical buffer considering the specific circumstances of external shocks and
economic cycles in Mongolia (MT—within 3 years).
Improve the systemic oversight framework
Enhance the quality and frequency of macro-financial and supervisory stress tests (MT).
Enhance the BoM’s capacity to link forward-looking analyses to the assessment of banks’ capital
adequacy and set bank-specific capital requirements (MT).
Enhance the early intervention framework
Provide clear legal powers to the BOM to take prompt action to correct problematic situations, even in
the absence of violations to regulations (ST).
Improve the CAMELS methodology to make it more robust and forward looking and reorient it as a
supervisory tool for early identification and prompt corrective action (ST).
Define list of specific minor and major actions, relating them to the redesigned CAMELS factors (ST).
Enhance the Supervisory Department’s internal coordination and effectiveness, empowering the
Supervisory Committee as the key decision maker (ST).
Improve crisis contingency and management
The Financial Stability Council should execute a Memorandum of Understanding for crisis preparedness
and management, and prepare a work program that includes contingency planning (ST).
Amend the Banking Law to explicitly forbid any court reversals of actions initiated as part of Provisional
Administration and Receivership (MT).
Amend the Banking Law triggers for Provisional Administration and Receivership to provide more
flexibility and timeliness in intervention (MT).
The ability to use budget financing for bank reorganization and the ability to return the intervened bank
to original shareholders should be eliminated from the Banking Law (MT).

Safeguards Assessments:
An update safeguards assessment of the Bank of Mongolia (BOM) finalized in June 2009
found that the BOM has continued to improve its safeguards framework since the previous
assessment. The BOM’s financial reporting and audit practices generally comply with
international standards. The assessment made recommendations to (i) strengthen certain
aspects of the BOM’s oversight mechanism, (ii) remove external audit qualifications caused
by lack of access to central bank’s vaults, and (iii) improve the timeliness of audit completion
and publication of the bank’s financial statements. The authorities have since confirmed that
the auditors were granted access to its vaults since end-2009, and the timing of audit
completion has improved.

Exchange Arrangement:
On March 24, 2009, the BOM instituted a foreign exchange auction allowing the
determination of the exchange rate mainly by market forces. The de facto and de jure
exchange rate arrangements are currently both classified as floating, though the de facto
exchange rate arrangement could potentially by reclassified to “crawl-like,” pending further
observation. (through end-May 2015).
Mongolia accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 on February 1, 1996.
Mongolia maintains two multiple currency practices (MCPs) subject to Fund jurisdiction. First,
the modalities of the multi-price auction system give rise to an MCP since there is no
mechanism in place that ensures that exchange rates of accepted bids at the multi-price
auction do not deviate by more than 2 percent. The Executive Board approved the multiprice auction MCP until June 22, 2010 (Decision No. 14365 of June 23, 2009), and it’s further
extension until March 15, 2012 or the next Article IV consultation whichever is earlier
(Decision No. 14669 of June 23, 2010 and Decision No. 14365 of March 16, 2011). The MCP,
however, could not be resolved by March 15, 2012, and would be continued as long as the
multiple price foreign exchange auction mechanism remains in place. Therefore the MCP is
unapproved, and since the criteria for approval of this MCP are not in place, staff does not
recommend Executive Board approval of said measure. In addition, Mongolia has an official
exchange rate (reference rate) that is mandatorily used for government transactions (as
opposed to the commercial market rate). Therefore, by way of official action, the authorities
have created a market segmentation. While Order #699 of the BOM issued on
December 3, 2010, sets forth that the reference rate is determined based on the weighted
average of market rates used from 4 PM of the previous day to 4 PM of the current day, staff
is of the view that this Order does not eliminate the market segmentation and the multiplicity
of effective rates arising from it. Accordingly, in the absence of a mechanism to ensure that
the commercial rates and the reference rate do not deviate by more than 2 percent, the way
the reference rate is used in government transactions gives rise to an MCP subject to Fund
approval. Since the criteria for approval of this MCP are not in place, it remains unapproved.
Mongolia imposes exchange restrictions for security reasons in accordance with United
Nations Security Council Resolution No. 92/757 concerning certain transactions with the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) that have been notified to the Fund
under Decision 144 (11/4/94).
The BOM notes that hitherto there have been no cases where exchange rates of accepted
bids at the multi-price auction deviate by more than 2 percent, and plans to introduce a
mechanism to ensure the deviation would never exceed 2 percent. The BOM is also working
on the development of an indicative spot exchange rate.

Article IV Consultation:
The 2013 Article IV consultation (IMF Country Report No. 14/64) was concluded by the
Executive Board on November 15, 2013. Mongolia is on a 12–month cycle.

WORLD BANK-IMF COLLABORATION
1.
World Bank and IMF country teams maintain a close working relationship. The teams,
led by Ms. Chorching Goh (Lead Economist, GMFDR) and Mr. Koshy Mathai (Mission Chief)
collaborate on a range of macroeconomic and structural issues.
2.

Cooperation and coordination is exemplary. It pertains to the following:



IMF surveillance. World Bank staff participates in Policy Consultation Meetings ahead of
Article IV consultation missions and comments on staff reports. World Bank staff also
participates in selected meetings of the Article IV mission team with the authorities. This
facilitates the discussions, especially as regards policies in areas of mutual interest such as
bank restructuring, social welfare reform, and fiscal policy.



Development Policy Credits (DPC) and Country Partnership Strategy (CPS). In turn, Fund
staff participated in the design and review of the Bank’s DPCs and was kept informed about
the development of the Bank’s new CPS for FY13−17.



Banking system issues. Both country teams have been active in this area, including by
fielding technical assistance missions. The teams coordinate closely to provide the
authorities with consistent advice while avoiding unnecessary duplication of efforts. The two
teams also continue to educate the public and parliamentarians on banking sector issues in
an effort to build support for reforms.



Structural reforms. Staff of the IMF and the World Bank have worked together successfully
to provide technical assistance in expenditure management, the Fiscal Stability Law, the
Integrated Budget Law, the Social Welfare Law, the Investment Law , and taxation of the
mineral sector and on-going work on the Sovereign Wealth Fund Law. Staff also actively
collaborated in the first assessment of Mongolia’s PFM system using the Public Expenditure
and Financial Accountability (PEFA) framework.



Policy Outreach. Both country teams jointly hosted a high-level conference on macroeconomic outlook as a forum for discussing economic developments and key challenges
with key policy makers.

3.
Based on the close collaboration, the World Bank and the IMF share a common view
about Mongolia’s macroeconomic and structural reform priorities. These include:


Promoting long-term growth. Managing the mineral wealth to ensure strong, sustainable,
and equitable growth with low inflation. This includes the importance of avoiding the
“resource curse” and the productive use of mineral wealth management.



Macro-economic stability. This includes ensuring that the boom-bust policies of the past
are not repeated. The Fiscal Stability Law adopted in 2010 with the support of the IMF and
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

5

MONGOLIA

the World Bank is a key step, and it is critical that it be strictly adhered to from 2013, the first
year the law is effective. At the same time, fiscal policy also has to be mindful of the
macroeconomic policy mix and medium and long-term fiscal sustainability.


Monetary policy. The Bank of Mongolia (BOM)’s large monetary stimulus, through its socalled “price stabilization program,” mortgage program, and liquidity injection, distorts
markets and is bound to ratchet up inflation. The stimulus program should be phased out
and the BOM should focus on further strengthening the monetary policy framework. The
flexible exchange rate regime should be maintained.



Protecting the poor. The 2012 Social Welfare Law envisages replacing existing costly
universal cash transfers with means-tested benefits that would reach the poorest
households. Full implementation of the law would represent a big step forward in
strengthening the social safety net and increasing fiscal flexibility. Concrete action following
the adoption of the law is important from a socio-economic perspective as well as a fiscal
perspective.



Strengthening the banking system. Key steps include continued improvement in bank
regulation and supervision, ramping up risk disclosure and management—especially given
elevated systemic risks in the sector illustrated by the recent failure of Saving Bank—and
strengthening the newly established Mongolian Deposit Insurance Corporation.

4.
The teams agreed to continue the close cooperation going forward. Table 1 details
the specific activities planned by the two country teams along with their expected deliveries. It
was also agreed that further details on collaboration, as necessary, would be agreed at the
technical level as work progresses.

RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK

2

Mongolia became a member of the Asian Development Bank (AsDB) in February 1991. The AsDB has
been Mongolia’s largest source of multilateral development finance for more than two decades and
since Mongolia joined AsDB, the country has received 60 loans totaling US$1.3 billion, 12 Asian
Development Fund grants and 2 Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR) grants for US$218 million.
In addition, 184 TA and JFPR TA grant projects with total value of $110.9 million have been
implemented and AsDB has supported trade through its Trade Finance Program, with a total value of
$106 million. AsDB has also approved 2 ongoing financing facilities for urban development and
urban transport, with up to $377 million currently available for drawdown.
In 2011, Mongolia gained access to AsDB’s ordinary capital resources (OCR), alongside AsDB’s
concessional lending from ADF; however Mongolia no longer has access to ADF grant financing.
Given its AAA credit rating, AsDB makes funding available for development projects on highly
favorable terms. This change was welcomed by the Government of Mongolia as large amounts of
capital are needed to finance infrastructure investments and, improvement of social services, and to
address urgent environmental problems.
AsDB has provided financial, technical and policy support in areas ranging from urban infrastructure,
agriculture, energy, finance, education, health, to social protection and transport. AsDB has also
provided over $100m private sector financing for commercial banks.
The Mongolia Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) 2012−16 was approved by AsDB’s board in April
2012. The CPS is prioritizing (i) transport, energy, and water supply infrastructure; (ii) access to
education and health; and (iii) regional economic cooperation in order to support sustainable and
inclusive growth of economy. In August 2014, reflecting changed government priorities and to meet
AsDB’s focus on employment creation and economic diversification, two strategic adjustments was
made to the Interim CPS 2014–2016: (i) the inclusion of two additional sectors (agriculture, natural
resources and rural development; and finance); and (ii) scaling up OCR resource allocations to meet
pressing development needs, from $50m annually to $200m.
For 2015, AsDB has offered to provide loans for US$200 million and US$72 million from OCR and
ADF funding sources, respectively. In addition, technical assistance worth US$11 million and JFPR
grant worth US$10 will be provided.
AsDB’s operations will concentrate on the following sectors in the following years:
Transport. Transport is the largest sector of AsDB operations in Mongolia. Under the Central Asia
Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) program, for which AsDB acts as Secretariat, AsDB is
financing construction of the country’s two main international road corridors, connecting Mongolia

to the People’s Republic of China and the Russian Federation. As a result, travel times from
Ulaanbaatar (UB) to the PRC border have recently come down from 20 hours to 7 hours. With a view
to boosting Mongolian exports, AsDB is also supporting Mongolia to harmonize cross-border
transport procedures, under the CAREC program, and developing logistics infrastructure and systems
in Zamyn-Uud on the border with the People’s Republic of China. AsDB also plans to support a
public transport system for UB, based on bus rapid transit.
Urban Development. AsDB is helping to improve living conditions and greater access to basic
services, including water, sanitation, and heating, to poor people in urban areas across the country,
including UB, provincial capitals and smaller towns in the mineral-rich Gobi area, where communities
are coping with a large population influx in response to new mining operations. AsDB plans to
extend basic urban infrastructure and construct socio-economic facilities in peri-urban areas of UB
city, home of nearly half of the population, to upgrade existing sub-centers for improved economic,
housing, and employment opportunities, and reduced environmental pollution. AsDB recently
approved the $320 million Ger Area Development Programme, with $160m financing from AsDB,
Euro 50m from the European Investment Bank and the remainder financed by the Government.
Energy. Insufficient and unreliable power and heating are becoming bottlenecks to growth and
threaten livelihoods. AsDB aims improve energy efficiency and capacity in UB, through upgrading
electrical transmission and distribution networks, by increasing efficiency of existing energy sources,
and preparing to finance the country’s first major $1.3 billion public–private partnership to construct
a new energy efficient combined heating and power plant in UB with proper emission reduction
equipment. AsDB will pilot the application of different renewable energy sources, including solar
thermal heating in remote districts.
Education. AsDB has supported the government’s efforts to reform and develop the education
system in all subsectors (pre-primary, primary, secondary, tertiary, technical and vocational education
and training). To meet pressing labor market demands, AsDB currently supports reform of higher
education has recently approved substantial financial support modernize vocational training, as well
as promoting PPPs in pre-primary and primary education
Health and Social Protection. AsDB has made major investments to improve primary health services
and supports policy reforms and investments in the hospital sector, drug and blood safety and
hospitals hygiene. AsDB assisted the government in introducing proxy means testing to target the
poor, reformation of several universal benefits, introduction of the food stamp program as the first
poverty-targeted benefit in the country, and passage of the amended Social Welfare Law in January
2012 that legalized the reforms. AsDB will continue to support the efficiency and transparency of the
delivery of social welfare and insurance services. Another planned area of support is the
improvement of access to education, employment and health care for disabled persons, who tend to
be left aside from the basic services.
Agriculture, Natural Resources and Rural Development. Recognizing the significant potential of
agriculture for employment creation, Mongolia needs to diversify the economy by developing value
chains for high-quality, locally made agricultural products. Establishing genuine Mongolian brands,

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MONGOLIA

and developing rigorous quality control and standardization of products would help Mongolian
companies to penetrate overseas markets. AsDB has been and will continue supporting this potential
through the development of agro-processing companies, and establishing brands. Sanitary and
phytosanitary measures are essential for Mongolia to boost its trade of agriculture products and
AsDB supports the country to upgrade these to international standards. Mongolia faces severe
development challenges in terms of sustainable growth, such as, grasslands desertification, water
scarcity, and a growing number of climate change-related disasters. AsDB will support the
sustainable management of natural resources (i.e., water, land, forests, and peatlands); water security
and information management; protected area management; climate change adaptation; institutional
strengthening; and rural renewable energy and livelihood improvement. AsDB aims to strengthen
natural disaster risk management. Working with private sector banks, AsDB has made over $80m
available for the development of micro, small and medium enterprises, especially in agribusiness.
Finance. While almost 90% of registered businesses in Mongolia are SMEs, most of them have limited
access to finance and are unable to contribute sufficiently to diversification of the economy,
employment creation, and economic growth. The expected outcome of AsDB’s interventions in the
financial sector is the increased use of more efficient financial intermediation by private sector
enterprises and individuals to support diversification of the economy and employment creation, in
particular in the agriculture sector. AsDB will help safeguard financial sector stability, improve access
to finance for SMEs through the support of financial infrastructure, and support long-term financing
for investments in infrastructure and green development.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of March 3, 2015)

I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision to the Fund is broadly adequate for surveillance, but some shortcomings exist
in the estimation of GDP and treatment of missing observations in price indices. The priority areas for
improvement are national accounts and price statistics, and also the migration of government finance
statistics to a new methodology.
National Accounts: The National Statistics Office (NSO) currently compiles and publishes annual and
quarterly GDP by production and expenditure approaches. Estimates are broadly in line with the 1993
SNA and are based on various census/surveys and administrative data sources. Annual GDP data are
available for 1990–2013. The constant price estimates use the base year 2005. The NSO has recently
improved the quality of national accounts data, but weaknesses remain, including in the estimation of
capital formation, imputed rent estimates, estimation of GDP in constant prices, and coverage of the
informal sector and small-scale activity (especially in the services sector). The NSO is currently
finalizing a supply-use table (SUT) for 2010 at current prices based on the 2008 SNA methodology and
has plans for implementing SUT as an integral part of the annual compilation process, in current and
constant prices. The SUT represents an important tool for the improvement of national accounts
estimates in Mongolia.
Price Statistics: The consumer price index (CPI) was rebased in January 2008 with expenditure-derived
weights from the 2005 Household Income and Expenditure Survey. The NSO has published a national
CPI for Ulaanbaatar and 21 aimags (provinces) since January 2008, and a housing price index since
October 2008. CPI compilation can further be improved by expanding the sample to include more
varieties and financial services and appropriate treatment of missing observations. The NSO also
publishes a producer price index (PPI). The major shortcoming with the currently compiled PPI for
industry continues to be the lack of imputation for missing prices—both temporarily and permanently
missing prices.
Government Finance Statistics: Currently, the concepts, classifications, and definitions used to
compile sub-annual and annual fiscal statistics for the consolidated general government operations
series used in APD generally follow the guidelines of the GFSM 1986. The authorities have indicated an
intention to adopt a migration path to the GFSM 2001 methodology. STA assists the authorities
compile and disseminate monthly and annual (cash-based) general government series in the
GFSM 2001-based Statement of Sources and Uses of cash (Revenue, Expenditure, Transaction in Assets
and Liabilities). A 2015 GFS TA mission will seek to compile a complete an annual (and quarterly)
balance sheet and integrated presentation of stock and flows for the consolidated general government
sector using the accrual (IPSAS-based) accounts maintained by the Ministry of Finance. The mission
will also seek to encourage the reporting of public sector debt statistics (PSDS), as these are not
reported systematically to the World Bank for dissemination on the PSDS Website.
Monetary and Financial Statistics: BOM’s monetary and financial statistics conform to the concepts
and definitions of the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM) methodology as the authorities
implemented recommendations of the latest monetary and financial statistics (MFS) missions. In
particular, the monetary data were improved by the proper classification of repurchase agreements,
accrued interest, and financial derivatives. The coverage of monetary statistics was expanded
beginning in February 2010 to include data of Savings and Credit Cooperatives (SCCs) that collect
deposits; and since May 2010 data for some other financial corporations (OFIs) have been
disseminated in the BOM’s Monthly Statistical Bulletin. The September 2009 mission provided
recommendations to reconcile the BOM and the Ministry of Finance data on government financing,

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

MONGOLIA

and finalized the standardized report forms for the data of the BOM and other depository corporations
for publication in International Financial Statistics beginning in November 2009. The July/August 2011
mission discussed the quality of data of the nonbank financial institutions (NBFIs), insurance
companies, and securities companies that are reported to the Financial Regulatory Commission (FRC)
and recommended their use in the compilation of monetary statistics. However, due to insufficient
coordination among various agencies, this recommendation has not been implemented.
Financial sector surveillance: With regard to financial soundness indicators (FSIs), Mongolia currently
does not report data to the Fund for dissemination on the Fund website.
External Sector Statistics: For compilation of external sector statistics (ESS), the Bank of Mongolia
(BOM) follows the statistical framework of the fifth edition of the Balance of Payment Manual (BPM5)
and expects to begin compiling and reporting ESS using the sixth edition of the Balance of Payments
and International Investment Position Manual (BPM6) during the first half of 2015. The coverage of the
balance of payments statistics has been broadened by extending the International Transaction
Reporting System (ITRS) to nonbank financial institutions and by increasing the number of direct
reporting private enterprises. Since May 2014, BOM has produced 2012-annual international
investment position data for submission to STA. Priorities for improvement are to (1) submit quarterly
external debt statistics to the World Bank’s Quarterly External Debt Statistics (QEDS) database in
collaboration with the Ministry of Finance; (2) release the first quarter data for 2014 using the BPM6
statistical framework; and (3) assess the State Registry Office’s database on all enterprises registered in
Mongolia to determine whether all relevant enterprises with direct investment are included in the
BOM’s ESS surveys.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Mongolia participates in the General Data
Dissemination System (GDDS).

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE
IV CONSULTATION—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Approved By
Markus Rodlauer and
Masato Miyazaki (IMF)
and Satu Kähkönen and
Mathew Verghis (IDA)

The Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) has been prepared
jointly by IMF and World Bank staff, in consultation with the
authorities, using the debt sustainability framework for lowincome countries approved by the Boards of both
institutions.

Based on the LIC-DSA analytical framework and a broader coverage of public debt
than previously used, this debt sustainability analysis (DSA) concludes that Mongolia is
at high risk of public debt distress under the baseline scenario. 1 This is not because
debt is on an ever-increasing path over the medium-term, but rather because key debt
indicators are currently elevated and, while expected to decline over time, would still
remain above the relevant thresholds for a number of years. This assessment shows a
significant deterioration of debt dynamics since the 2013 Article IV, which suggested a
moderate risk under a “strong policy scenario.” In 2014, the fiscal deficit ceiling set
forth under the Fiscal Stability Law (FSL) was breached, DBM borrowed large amounts
at commercial terms, and the BOM continued to draw down its swap line established
with the People’s Bank of China (PBC). Public debt could rise further in the near term
as the newly passed Debt Management Law allows more room for the government to
contract debt and guarantees.2

1

The low-income country debt sustainability framework (LIC DSF) recognizes that better policies and institutions allow countries to
manage higher levels of debt, and thus the threshold levels are policy-dependent. Mongolia’s policies and institutions, as measured
by the World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA), place it as a “medium performer”, with an average rating of
3.43 during 2011-13. The relevant indicative thresholds for this category are: 40 percent for the NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio,
150 percent for the NPV of debt-to-exports ratio, 250 percent for the NPV of debt-to-revenue ratio, 20 percent for the debt serviceto-exports ratio, and 20 percent for the debt service-to-revenue ratio. These thresholds are applicable to public and publicly
guaranteed external debt.
2

This DSA is based on end-2014 debt data. The fiscal year for Mongolia is January–December. The 2013 DSA (see IMF Country
Report No. 14/64) was based on end-2013 debt data.

MONGOLIA

A. Background
1.
Based on the LIC-DSA framework and a broad coverage of public debt, this DSA
concludes that Mongolia faces a high risk of debt distress under the baseline scenario. This
DSA assesses public debt, including general government debt, Euro bonds issued by the
Development Bank of Mongolia, the drawing of the PBOC swap line by the Bank of Mongolia (BOM),
and also borrowing by, and government guarantees for SOEs, which were not included in the
previous DSA as such data were not reliably available at the time.3 External public and publicly
guaranteed (PPG) debt reached more than 56 percent of GDP by end-2014, and key external debt
indicators have breached, or are projected to breach, the relevant indicative thresholds; debt-service
ratios spike in various years when external bonds mature, and some of these breaches are significant
in magnitude and persist for extended periods under both baseline and stress tests. Public debt
stood at 77 percent of GDP, and will stay above the benchmark for almost the entire projection
period (2015-2035).4 Total external debt rose to 170 percent of GDP—reflecting, in large part,
intercompany lending in the mining sector—undermining the economy’s resilience to external
shocks. The elevated debt ratios have also raised market concern—credit rating agencies have
downgraded Mongolia’s sovereign rating several times since the issuance of Eurobonds in late 2012
and have maintained a negative outlook, and Mongolia’s sovereign spreads are among the highest
of all frontier economies.
2.
Debt dynamics have worsened since the 2013 DSA, mainly reflecting a substantial
increase in domestic public debt and external PPG debt. The “strong policy scenario” of the 2013
DSA, which envisaged significant fiscal restraint and monetary tightening, did not take place.
Instead, the 2014 on-budget deficit reached 4¼ percent of GDP compared to the FSL limit of
2 percent, and off-budget spending by the Development Bank of Mongolia (DBM) amounted to
6¾ percent of GDP, keeping the consolidated fiscal deficit at 11 percent of GDP, similar to 2013.
Debt dynamics have deteriorated substantially, reflecting extensive borrowing by the DBM, further
drawing of the swap line by BOM, and large amounts of domestic bonds issued close to end-2014
(see table 1). Moreover, exchange rate depreciation caused external debt to increase further relative
to GDP. The expansion of public debt coverage to include borrowings by, and government
guarantees for, SOEs, raises the reported debt ratio by 8¾ percent of GDP in 2013.5 But the elevated
debt risk is mainly attributable to aggressive borrowing rather than this expansion of coverage. On
the authorities’ definition—i.e., in NPV terms, and excluding the PBOC swap drawings—public debt
amounted to 55 percent of GDP at end-2014, in excess of the FSL’s 40 percent limit.
3.
The institutional framework of debt management has also been altered. Even the
authorities’ estimate—i.e., considering their calculation of debt NPV with the Bank of Mongolia’s
3

The authorities’ definition of public debt excludes the BOM swap line. And debt as defined under the FSL and DML
has recently been changed to exclude SOE debt and secured government guarantees. Moreover, the authorities
consider debt in NPV, not nominal, terms.
4

The public debt benchmark is derived on an empirical basis, and varies among countries with their respective CPIA
score.

This broad coverage is in line with the DSA Guidance Note (2013).

swap line excluded—shows public debt amounted to 54.7 percent of GDP at end-2014 and thus far
exceeded the 40 percent threshold enshrined in the FSL. Recent amendments to the FSL and a new
Debt Management Law narrowed the definition of debt to government debt only by excluding SOE
borrowing and government guarantees secured by government securities. This legal framework also
laid out a path for bringing the deficit and government debt back to the original limits within a few
years. The new laws will thus provide additional room for the government to contract debt and
provide guarantees in the near term. Staff does not support the narrowing of public debt coverage,
nor the temporary increase of debt ceiling. Staff also explained the need to include all DBM
spending and BOM swap line drawing in public debt for the following reasons:


DBM spending. All DBM activities should be included in the statistics (revenue, expenditure,
deficit, and financing) of general government for Mongolia. This practice reflects the
institutional unit approach as stated by international statistical manuals (GFSM 2014, SNA
2008 and BPM6). Although in limited circumstances international statistical manuals allow
for commercial or market activities of general government units to be split out, but the
current activities undertaken by DBM clearly do not satisfy the requirements.



BOM swap. Since this DSA covers the entire public sector, BOM’s liability relating to the
swap should be included.

Mongolia’s long-term prospects remain bright, but liquidity risks are high in the near
term. The country’s resource wealth is estimated at $1 trillion to $3 trillion, and this is assumed to
continue being realized gradually. Mongolia is thus projected to be solvent given the strong
projected revenues from mining over the long term. It does, however, face serious liquidity
pressures and risks in the short run, before mining exports ramp up. Until then, financing outsized
prospective fiscal and BOP deficits will be difficult, and thus policies should be focused to avoid
building up excessive debt and manage BOP pressure.
5.
The authorities have embarked on policy tightening, but more needs to be done. Part
of DBM’s spending has been brought on budget, and the consolidated fiscal deficit is expected to
decline this year. The authorities target ambitious deficit reduction (to 5 percent of GDP this year,
and 2 percent by 2018, excluding “commercial” DBM spending) but this is not likely to materialize
on current policies. (Responding to these concerns, the authorities envisage a government
resolution to cut spending administratively, to be backed up by a second supplementary budget
later in the year). The BOM has hiked the policy rate twice, slowed the pace of PSP and mortgage

lending, and proposed transferring the existing stock of PSP loans to the government’s balance
sheet; nonetheless, credit growth is higher than desirable. The authorities have redoubled efforts to
reach agreement with investors on large projects and introduced other structural measures to boost
exports and reduce imports. Steps have been taken to strengthen the banks and to improve bank
supervision and crisis preparedness. Nevertheless, these policy adjustments may not be sufficient to
ensure macro-stability. Under the baseline, the consolidated fiscal deficit (including all DBM
spending) would decline but remain above the FSL limit (2 percent of GDP). A large BOP financing
gap, estimated at about $2 billion over the next three years (discussed below), will be financed at
least partly by public borrowing or debt contracted with government guarantees.6
6.
Baseline assumptions differ significantly from those in the “strong policy scenario”
used in the previous DSA:


The previous DSA projected the fiscal deficit to fall below 2 percent of GDP in 2016, while
here it drops to 4 percent from 2019.



The previous DSA projected a complete phaseout of unconventional monetary easing
programs, which helped to bring credit growth down to around 13½ percent, while here
some of these programs continue, albeit on a smaller scale, and credit growth is around
16 percent.



Reflecting updated information on OT-1 output, mining growth is revised down from an
average of 5½ percent to 3½ percent, while nonmineral growth is revised down from
6½ percent to 5½ percent, on account of weakened near-term investor confidence. Given
weaker activity, this DSA also revises CPI inflation down from a medium-term average of
7½ percent to 7 percent. The real exchange rate is assumed to remain constant.



Finally, while there was no BOP financing gap in the previous DSA, the current BOP
envisages a financing gap (relative to zero reserves) of $2 billion mainly because of weaker
capital and financial inflows.7 It is assumed that 62 percent of the financing gap will be filled
by government borrowing or debt with government guarantees—this ratio is consistent with
the share of public external debt in total external debt (excluding intercompany lending).
This borrowing also reflects additional borrowing space created by the revised legal
framework (the revised FSL and the new DML).

B. Debt Sustainability under Baseline Scenario
7.
Debt is not on an ever-increasing path under the baseline scenario. Both external and
public debt scaled by GDP would fall after an initial period.8 This reflects promising prospects of the
mining sector in outer years and fiscal adjustment measures enshrined in the legal system.
Nevertheless, the debt path is sensitive to external shocks. Meanwhile, disputes surrounding OT-2,
6

The financing gap is defined as the shortfall of BOP financing after FX reserves fall to zero. Considering the need to
build up FX reserves, the financing needs could be even larger.

7

An important difference is that the current DSA baseline assumes no rollover of the maturing sovereign and quasisovereign bonds in 2017, while the previous DSA assumes a full rollover of these debts.
8

4

Residuals reflect large capital outflows under “currency and deposits” and change of FX reserves.

MONGOLIA

which is assumed to be addressed by end-2015 under the baseline, add to economic uncertainty.
Should it be further delayed, growth prospects would be dampened, fiscal risk would rise, and BOP
financing gap could be wider, but the debt path would still trend down slowly. To put the debt
trajectory on a more sustainable footing, more needs to be done. Below is a summary of the debt
indicators under the baseline scenario:
External DSA
8.
Mongolia’s external PPG debt indicators have all breached, or are projected to breach,
the thresholds, and will remain above these thresholds, in some cases for a prolonged time.
The detailed results are as follows:


The present value of external PPG debt reached 57 percent of GDP by end-2014, far above
the indicative threshold of 40 percent.9 It is expected to peak at 64½ percent of GDP in
2016, and gradually moderate to below the threshold in 2025 onwards.



The present value of external PPG debt would peak at 170½ percent of exports in 2017, and
stay above the threshold of 150 percent in about half of the projection period.



The present value of external PPG debt in relation to revenue would slightly breach the
threshold only in 2016–17. It would peak at 259¼ percent in 2017, and decline steadily,
falling to 113 percent in 2035.



Debt service indicators, i.e. debt service-to-exports and debt service-to-revenue, would
briefly breach the thresholds several times (each time for just one year), including in 2017
and 2022, when the Chinggis bonds mature.

9.
Meanwhile, these debt indicators are susceptible to various standard shocks such as a
sharp exchange rate depreciation and decline of BOP inflows. Given a one-time 30 percent
exchange rate depreciation, the present value of external PPG debt would peak at 89½ percent of
GDP in 2017 and stay above the indicative threshold for almost the entire projection period; the
present value of external debt-to-revenue would peak at 359 percent and stay above the threshold
for seven years; and debt service-to-revenue would peak at 70percent in 2017 and stay above its
threshold until 2027. In the case of a one-standard deviation shock to non-debt creating BOP flows,
the present value of debt-to-exports would peak at 235¼ percent in 2017 and stay above the
threshold through the whole projection period; and debt service-to-exports would breach its
threshold in 14 out of the 21-year projection period.
10.
The standard “historical scenario”—where key variables follow historical paths and
debt ratios thus decline rapidly—does not seem to represent a possible outcome. For example,
FDI inflows peaked at more than $4 billion per year in 2011-12, and have since dropped sharply to
just $542 million in 2014. Even if OT-2 is launched soon, FDI would likely peak at only $2½ billion in
the next few years. By the same token, real GDP growth would also be more moderate in the future
barring the investment boom observed in 2011–12.
9

The discount rate is 5 percent, according to the DSA guidelines.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MONGOLIA

Public DSA
11.
Public ratios would remain elevated across the projection period. The present value of
public debt-to-GDP ratio peaks at 95¾ percent of GDP in 2017 and then falls gradually, to 53
percent by end-2035. This ratio has been far above the benchmark (56 percent), and is expected to
decline below the benchmark only in 2032 onward. The present value of public debt-to-revenue
ratio would peak at just below 400 percent in 2017, and thereafter falls gradually to just above 200
percent in 2035. The debt service-to-revenue ratio would spike several times, peaking in 2017 at
71 percent and hovering around 40 percent in most of the projection period. Debt could rise further
if some banks need to be recapitalized, and if this requires fiscal resources.
12.
The alternative scenarios and bound tests indicate that the projected paths of debt
indicators are sensitive to alternative assumptions. In particular, the scenario in which the
primary balance is fixed at the level prevailing in 2014 illustrates a steadily rising trend of debt ratios,
underscoring the urgent need for fiscal consolidation.
13.
The uncertainty surrounding OT-2 represents an important downside risk, but debt
ratios would still decline steadily even if the project were delayed by three years. In this
context, the present value of external PPG debt would peak at 70¾ percent of GDP in 2017, and
decline thereafter steadily, to 27 percent of GDP at the end of the projection period; meanwhile, the
present value of public debt would reach 103 percent of GDP, and then decline consistently, to
53 percent of GDP by 2035. The present value of external PPG debt would stay above its threshold
for 10 years, and the most severe shock would cause this ratio to peak at 98¼ percent of GDP in
2017, though it would fall over time, to below the threshold close to the end of the projection
period. Spikes of external debt service ratios would be more severe than under the baseline
assumption of no delay in OT-2.

C. Debt Sustainability under Policy Adjustment Scenario
14.
Macro policies need to be tightened to keep current account deficits at more
manageable levels and to improve the fiscal position. One possible adjustment scenario is
summarized below:


Fiscal. The fiscal path needs to be secured with Parliamentary approval for measures to
control spending, both on-budget and off, as part of a coherent, medium-term macro
framework. In the adjustment scenario, all DBM spending is brought on-budget and the
fiscal deficit would be reduced to 2 percent of GDP in 2017 onward.



Monetary. The BOM should cease all unconventional easing programs targeting particular
industries or involving direct lending to the private sector, returning to traditional centralbanking functions; these programs should, if desired, by conducted by the government,
competing with other spending priorities for funds within the budget. The monetary stance
should be tightened further, to control credit growth and support the BOP. Credit growth
slows to about 12 percent (y/y) in the adjustment scenario.

6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MONGOLIA



Exchange rate policy. Foreign-exchange intervention should be limited to dealing with
episodes of excessive volatility, and the exchange rate should be allowed to move flexibly.



Growth and inflation. Given the policy tightening, non-mining growth would initially slow
to 1 percent in 2015 and then gradually pick up to 6½ percent over the medium term. Real
exchange rate is assumed to depreciate by 4 percent per year in 2015-17 barring BOM
intervention. The exchange rate depreciation will have pass-through effects on inflation,
which would stay high at 9½ percent in 2015 and gradually moderate to 6½ percent.



Balance of payments. Macro policy tightening, lower growth and real exchange rate
depreciation will all help compress imports. Current account deficit will decline by about
$800 million in the next three years, compared to the baseline. As a consequence, the
balance of payments will have no financing gap and FX reserves will stand at 1¾ months of
imports by end-2017.

15.
Debt dynamics improve significantly under the policy adjustment scenario. The present
value of external PPG debt would peak at 63¾ percent of GDP in 2017, and decline to below its
threshold in 2023 (compared to 2025 in the baseline). Unlike in the baseline, the present value of
Mongolia: PV of Public Debt (Percent of GDP)
debt-to-export and debt-to-revenue will not
breach their relevant thresholds under the
policy adjustment scenario. Debt service ratios
would still breach their thresholds several times,
but by a smaller margin than under the
baseline. The present value of public debt
would peak at 83½ percent of GDP in 2017

D. Authorities’ Views
16.
The authorities generally concurred with this assessment, but highlighted a few
observations. First, they doubted whether the BOM swap line should be included in the public debt,
wondered if this practice is broadly applied, and noted that, as a swap, and not an outright loan,
there is a counterpart asset in togrog. They noted that public debt as defined in the FSL does not
include the central bank’s debt, and that public debt is calculated in NPV terms. Second, their
calculation of public debt in NPV terms differs from staff’s estimate. Third, the budget only includes
non-commercial activity of the DBM, while staff include all DBM lending. As a consequence, staff’s
estimates of the fiscal deficit and of debt are larger than those presented by the authorities.

E. Conclusion
17.
This DSA concludes that Mongolia suffers from high risk of debt distress. In recent
years, the authorities have embarked on borrowing to finance rapidly growing budget and offbudget spending. External PPG debt has almost doubled from around 30 percent of GDP to just
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

7

MONGOLIA

below 60 percent in the past four years. Public debt stood at below 80 percent of GDP by end-2014,
and could further increase given the lax fiscal policy and loosening of borrowing limits offered by
the DML. Although debt indicators, mainly external and public debt scaled by GDP, would decline
steadily under the baseline, they would remain elevated for prolonged periods.
18.
The debt dynamics exhibit a high vulnerability to shocks and bound tests. External PPG
debt ratios would rise dramatically in the case of a sharp exchange rate depreciaiton or negative
shocks to BOP inflows. Public debt would be on an ever-increasing trajectory should the primary
deficit remain at the level prevailing in 2014. Moreover, total external debt, both public and private,
has reached about 140 percent of GDP, and this has made the macro-financial stability highly
susceptible to exchange rate movements and flucutation of BOP flows.
19.
These risks call for immediate policy actions. Although some fiscal adjustment measures
have been announced, they are not sufficient to safeguard macro-financial stability and to ensure
debt sustainability in case of adverse shocks. Staff suggests more pronounced policy tighening
instead. Under a policy adjustment scenario, debt indicators improve significantly—external debt
indicators either do not breach their thresholds, or breach them with a smaller margin; public debt
as a share of GDP would fall below the benchmark more quickly than under the baseline.
Macroeconomic Assumptions
The baseline scenario assumes the authorities’ current policies, including those proposed under the CMAP
framework (but not the latest fiscal cuts that are under consideration). The details are summarized below:



Real sector. It is assumed that OT-2 will start construction from late 2015 and begin operation in 2020.



Fiscal. The authorities target the fiscal deficit at 5 percent of GDP for 2015, and aim to bring the deficit
down to 2 percent of GDP by 2018. However, given certain unrealistic assumptions and the need to
reflect all DBM spending in the budget, staff project the fiscal deficit to remain close to 10 percent of
GDP in 2015, and gradually to decline to 4 percent of GDP from 2019 onward.



Monetary. While the BOM has raised the policy rate twice in recent months and scaled down some
monetary easing programs, other unconventional programs have continued and expanded. Given these
developments, staff project credit growth at about 16 percent over the medium term.



Balance of payments. The current account deficit is projected to average 13½ percent of GDP over the
medium term, before OT-2 starts to export mining commodities in 2020. FDI would average about 2½
billion per year on account of OT-2 related investment. In 2017, maturing debt of more than $1½ billion
would exert heavy pressure on the BOP. A large financing gap is expected to emerge, and it is assumed
that about two-thirds of this gap will be filled by public borrowing.



Exchange rate. Staff project a constant real exchange rate, along with declining reserves.

The adjustment scenario instead assumes that: (i) the fiscal deficit, with all DBM spending brought on
budget, is brought down to 2 percent of GDP from 2017 onward; (ii) unconventional easing programs at the
BOM are transferred to the budget or discontinued altogether, and credit growth drops to 12 percent; (iii)
the exchange rate is allowed to move flexibly; and (iv) market rollovers are easier. With these assumptions,
BOP financing gaps are closed.

Includes both public and private sector external debt.
Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

1/ Debt data reflects general government debt (including quasi-sovereign bonds issued by DBM) only before 2013, and starts to cover SOE debt from 2013 onwards.
2/ Gross financing need is defined as the primary deficit plus debt service plus the stock of short-term debt at the end of the last period.
3/ Revenues excluding grants.
4/ Debt service is defined as the sum of interest and amortization of medium and long-term debt.
5/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.

Statement by the Staff Representative on Mongolia
April 3, 2015
This statement summarizes additional information on economic developments and policies
that have become available since the staff report was issued. This information does not alter
the thrust of the staff appraisal.
1.
The most recent economic data have been broadly as envisaged. Inflation has
continued to moderate, dropping to 9¼ percent in February. The economy registered a trade
surplus in the first two months of the year, with exports up 27 percent over 2014, and imports
down 25 percent, but the overall balance of payments remains in deficit. Fiscal revenue has
stayed weak, with collections in the first two months of the year accounting for 11 percent of
the annual budget.
2.
The authorities have confirmed their agreement with many of the key Article IV
recommendations and are in the process of implementing policy changes. In a letter
shared with staff on March 26, 2015, they outlined their policy intentions, including their
commitment to a medium-term fiscal consolidation path, and detailed their recent policy
efforts. In particular:


The authorities are targeting a fiscal deficit of 5 percent of GDP in 2015, including
the “non-commercial” spending of the Development Bank of Mongolia (DBM), and
intend to reduce this gradually to 2 percent of GDP by 2018.



The authorities have linked the payment of civil-service wage increases—about ½
percent of GDP, and restricted to lower-income workers—to budget revenue
performance and scheduled such payments for the end of the year. They are also
considering the possibility of freezing DBM spending.



Remaining loans under the Price Stabilization Program (PSP) will be transferred to
the government balance sheet by end-June. Working groups have been set up to
analyze the appropriate future for PSP and mortgage lending.



A comprehensive set of measures is envisaged to strengthen DBM governance. In
particular, an independent assessment—possibly with assistance from the World
Bank—will be conducted to determine the bankability of the DBM’s “commercial
projects,” and the DBM will be brought under supervision of the Bank of Mongolia
(BOM).



The authorities consider measures to protect the most vulnerable as a high priority
and are considering options to strengthen the effectiveness of existing social
programs with high impact on the poor (such as child allowances and food stamps).



The authorities are committed to exchange-rate flexibility.

2


In order to strengthen the banking system, the BOM intends, over 2015–17, to:
increase loan loss provisions; tighten requirements for recognition of nonperforming
loans; increase the minimum paid-in capital of banks; raise the Tier-1 capital
adequacy ratio (CAR) to 10½ percent for systemically important banks; incorporate
PSP loans into banks’ CAR calculations; increase sectoral risk weights; and impose
additional capital requirements on banks with higher risk profiles.



The authorities are working on a range of steps, including tax measures, to improve
the investment climate.

3.
The authorities’ efforts to strengthen policies are welcome, although additional
steps will be needed, and full and early implementation will be critical.

Press Release No. 15/169
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2015 Article IV Consultation with Mongolia
On April 3, 2015, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
2015 Article IV Consultation1 with Mongolia.
Medium- to long-term prospects are promising given Mongolia’s large natural resources. In the
near term, however, the country continues to face balance-of-payments (BOP) pressures on
account of low foreign direct investment (FDI) and weak commodity prices, as well as
expansionary macro policies. Imports have now started to taper off, and, with the first phase of
the Oyu Tolgoi copper and gold mine now in operation, exports have picked up. The trade
balance has thus improved, but with FDI and other financial-account flows still depressed, the
overall BOP remains weak. In addition, public debt has risen sharply, and the banking sector
should be watched closely in the wake of the rapid credit expansion over the past two years.
Barring a change in policies and/or major new developments in the real economy, these trends
are likely to continue. Risks are to the downside, and relate to possible difficulties in securing
agreement on major investment projects, as well as to the possibilities of a further slowdown in
China or a surge in global financial market volatility.
Recognizing these challenges, the new government has already taken some policy action. It
has implemented a “Comprehensive Macro Adjustment Plan” which targets a substantial
reduction in the fiscal deficit, phases out some of the Bank of Mongolia’s unconventional easing
programs, and introduces a number of structural measures to boost exports and substitute for
imports. However, additional measures—now under discussion—are needed to underpin the
fiscal deficit targets, strengthen monetary and banking-sector policies, and ensure the most
vulnerable are protected from the impact of the necessary macro adjustment.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that Mongolia’s economic prospects remain promising over the
medium to long term given its natural resource wealth, although the country faces substantial
macroeconomic challenges in the near term. Directors welcomed the policy adjustment
envisaged by the authorities and called for further adjustment to strengthen the balance of
payments and public finances, safeguard financial stability, and strengthen social safety nets.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with
officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive
Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the
views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of
any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

Directors agreed that an ambitious consolidation approach would be needed to strengthen the
fiscal position. They welcomed the steps already taken and the authorities’ readiness to
undertake additional fiscal reforms. Directors saw scope for further cuts in public spending,
including that of the Development Bank of Mongolia (DBM), complemented with measures to
raise revenue, protect the poor, and improve the effectiveness of subsidies and other social
programs. They looked forward to the passage of a supplementary budget that includes these
measures. Directors also supported the authorities’ intention to phase out unconventional
easing programs by the central bank and encouraged them to bring all DBM spending onto the
budget.
Directors agreed on the need for some monetary tightening, while ensuring that banks remain
adequately liquid, to help control credit growth and strengthen the balance of payments. They
also encouraged the central bank to limit deficit financing. These steps should be
complemented with continued efforts to enhance governance at the central bank and the DBM.
Noting the role of exchange rate flexibility as a shock absorber for the economy, Directors
agreed that foreign exchange intervention should be limited to smoothing excessive volatility.
Directors recommended a comprehensive approach to addressing risks in the banking system.
They considered it a priority to bolster banks’ provisions and capital buffers, eliminate
forbearance, strengthen risk recognition, and enhance supervisory and crisis preparedness
frameworks. Directors commended the authorities for the progress in strengthening the regime
against money laundering and terrorism financing.
Directors supported ongoing efforts to foster high, inclusive growth, by improving the
investment climate, enhancing competitiveness, and promoting economic diversification. More
broadly, they emphasized that prudent management of natural resources is critically important
for lasting growth and inter-generational equity.
It is expected that the next Article IV consultation with Mongolia will be held on the standard 12month cycle.

Statement by Barry Sterland, Executive Director for Mongolia
and Dorjkhand Togmid Advisor to Executive Director
April 3, 2015
On behalf of the Mongolian authorities, we would like to thank the mission team for their
candid policy consultation and the effective engagement. The current Government was formed
in November 2014 and has set about dealing with the macroeconomic challenges it inherited.
Mongolian Authorities are in broad agreement with staff’s analysis and policy
recommendations, especially on the strengthening fiscal position, maintaining prudent
monetary policy, bolstering financial stability and improving the investment climate. The
Authorities have commenced concrete actions to adjust macroeconomic and financial policies
in response to all the broad areas of weakness identified by the staff. They express their
willingness to address the macroeconomic and development challenges facing Mongolia
through continued cooperation with the Fund.
Economic Outlook
Mongolia has made strong development progress in recent years, retains enormous longrun economic potential, but faces challenges in ensuring sustained and stable growth in
the short to medium-term. Economic growth of Mongolia remained at 7.8 percent and per
capita income reached $4,000 in 2014, but growth is expected to slow in the next few years.
The economy remains vulnerable to boom-bust cycles and has faced sharp declines in FDI over
the past few years.
Mongolia faced a severe balance of payment shock in late 2012 throughout 2013 and 2014
though measures were taken to achieve a soft landing. Commodities super cycle turned down,
capital flows toward emerging markets and developing economies reversed, and net foreign direct
investment to GDP ratio substantially declined from 45 percent to only 5 percent over the last three
years. The balance of payment shock was particularly intense in 2013 though authorities consider
the impacts on trade, the current account, and economic activity were significantly lessened in 2014
as a result of policy adjustments. Real GDP growth gradually slowed down from 12.3 percent in
2012 to 11.6 percent in 2013 and 7.8 percent in 2014.

Inflation has decreased gradually in past years and appears broadly under control, and
actions have been taken to slow credit and money growth. Annual CPI inflation decreased
from 14.0 percent in 2012 to 9.3 percent as of February 2015. Supply-driven inflationary
pressure has been substantially decreased. The Bank of Mongolia (BOM) has gradually
tightened its monetary policy stance by increasing the policy interest rate twice, 1.5 percentage
points in July 2014 and 1.0 percentage point to 13 percent in January 2015. Real interest rates
are now strongly positive and money and credit growth have slowed significantly. These
decisions have reduced aggregate demand and the current account deficit, curbed inflationary
pressure, and promoted macroeconomic and financial stability.

2

Uncertainty in the balance of payment outlook still remains a concern, and the authorities
are pursuing a range of options to reduce risks on this front. The baseline forecast indicates
that overall balance of payment could face a 1.4 billion dollars financing deterioration in 2015
due to mainly unfavorable external environment for the mineral exports and a sharp fall of the
FDI inflows in the past two years. We note that recent import data has been weaker than the
assumptions of this baseline which, if this weakness persists, may assist in ameliorating
financing needs. However, authorities accept that a range of actions must be explored to deal
with this challenge. They are working closely with a range of international financial
organizations and bilateral partners on the possible options for external financing to fill this
gap, including the extension of the local currency swap facility between the BOM and PBOC
that has been playing a crucial role in mitigating the impacts of the shocks. The authorities
have indicated that the PBOC has reaffirmed that it is fully committed to continuing the facility
and willing to extend the swap line. Ongoing close consultation with the IMF and
responsiveness to its recommendations will assist in this process of engagement with other
financing partners. Furthermore, efforts are ongoing to advance negotiations on major projects
with a significant potential impact on development and FDI flows. Finally, authorities stand
ready to take additional corrective action, if required, to deal with unfolding risks, by adjusting
import-intensive spending or fiscal policy.
Fiscal Policy
The authorities are committed to significant reductions in structural deficit targets,
including limiting off-budget and reducing quasi-fiscal operations and integrating them
into the Budget. In order to strengthen Mongolia’s fiscal position, the authorities have secured
Parliamentary approval of the Amendment to the Fiscal Stability Law (FSL), Debt
Management Law (DML), and the Comprehensive Macroeconomic Adjustment Program
(CMAP). As a result, the authorities will achieve a 2015 fiscal deficit of 5 percent of GDP,
including non-commercial Development Bank of Mongolia (DBM) investment, decreasing the
deficit by 1 percentage point for each year to reach the deficit target of 2 percent of GDP by
2018 and implement a cost-saving regime in the budget through prioritizing spending.
Concrete measures have been introduced to cut budget expenditures and increase the
revenue in line with these fiscal objectives. Budget resources earmarked for civil servants’
wage increase have been decreased by 60 percent and targeted at maintaining real wages of low
wage earners, equivalent to a reduction in spending by 0.6 percent of GDP. Authorities are
considering ways of targeting non-social welfare related subsidies. On the revenue side, the
authorities increased the customs duties and excise tax rates on imported oil, in response to the
recent declines of oil prices.
The Government of Mongolia has started implementing recommendations of
international financial organizations to limit off-budget and quasi-fiscal operations and

3
integrate them to the budget. The parliament has agreed to the integration of off-budget
‘quasi fiscal’ spending into the central budget. This includes several programs currently
operated by the Bank of Mongolia. A comprehensive set of actions are being undertaken to
improve the legal environment and governance structure of the DBM to match international
principles and standards and to ensure the successful operation of the bank in international
financial markets. As a first step, the authorities are planning to transfer non-commercial
lending activities in the pipeline of the DBM to the budget after conducting an independent
assessment on the portfolio. While commercial DBM spending is not being fully integrated
with central budget at this stage controls are being greatly enhanced to ensure these
investments are driven by market considerations. The Minister of Finance will now approve
financing of projects and activities included in the 2015 budget, to ensure consistency with the
budget deficit and macroeconomic conditions (including BOP requirements). Furthermore, the
DBM shall now obtain the Finance Minister’s opinion when taking on a direct or contingent
liability or any other explicit or implicit financial obligations regarding the consistency of
any such liabilities with the FSL. Controls are being put in place to prevent political
intervention in decision making processes, and more generally, improve governance and
oversight. Another key element regarding control is that the Finance Minister and the
Governor of the Bank of Mongolia will jointly approve supervision rules on DBM
operations, effectively putting the DBM under the BOM supervision. Amendments along
these lines will be introduced to Parliament in the Spring Session. The authorities are also
investigating the potential to transfer key social programs currently in the Future Heritage Fund
to the central budget.
The authorities will keep fiscal settings under review to ensure public debt is managed
appropriately. The Medium-term Debt Management Strategy and the Comprehensive
External Debt Servicing Plan have been revised in accordance with the newly adopted Debt
Management Law and the CMAP was approved by the Financial Stability Committee on
March 13 of this year. Under this approach, the authorities will initiate active debt and liability
management operations to ensure further debt is serviced or rolled over in a way that is
consistent with macroeconomic stability.
The authorities are taking step to underpin Mongolia’s long time fiscal future through the
establishment of a sovereign wealth fund. The draft Law on Future Heritage Fund is
expected to be reviewed and passed during the 2015 Spring Session of the Parliament. The
fund would be designed consistent with international best practices. The aim is to ‘ring fence’ a
certain portion of mining revenues to support future development needs, while also supporting
the realization of counter-cyclical policies.
Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
Supply-driven inflationary pressure has been substantially decreased and inflation appears
broadly under control. There has been a positive change in the composition of inflation since

4
2013, with ‘supply shock inflation’ being significantly reduced. The BOM considers that this
positive development is due to the PSP and a range of measures reducing headline inflation. The
inflation outlook consistent with the Bank of Mongolia’s medium-term target of 7 percent, and real
interest rates are now strongly positive. Monetary policy will continue to be managed in a
prudent way to control inflationary pressures.
The BOM considers unconventional monetary policy measures have assisted in achieving a
soft landing and is now phasing out programs as planned in the context of the broader
macroeconomic adjustment program. The BOM considers its unconventional monetary policy
measures, including the price stabilization program (PSP), as instrumental in achieving a softlanding for the economy, mitigating impacts in the balance of payment shock on the economy and
risks of a potential economic crisis, reducing supply-driven pressures on inflation, and ensuring
financial sector stability. With the implementation of the CMAP, measures are being taken to
normalize unconventional aspects of the monetary policy and the BOM has been intentionally
phasing out the program as planned. Remaining PSP loans shall be transferred to the
Government by the end of the 1st half of 2015, and this process has already commenced. The
Government and the BOM are jointly examining the Sustainable Mortgage Financing Program
including how it aligns with long term efforts to boost domestic savings and possible response
options.

The Bank of Mongolia remains committed to a flexible exchange rate regime. If necessary,
the Bank of Mongolia intends to intervene only for the purpose of smoothing out excessive
exchange rate volatility.
The Bank of Mongolia will look for opportunities to enhance monetary policy decision
making frameworks at an appropriate time.
Structural Reforms
The authorities are committed to improving the investment climate to assist growth and
contribute to the resolution of BOP challenges. The authorities have submitted Parliament
draft amendments to simplify tax laws and enhance their contribution to private sector growth,
including by reducing inconsistencies and ambiguities. The authorities proposed amendments
to the VAT to reduce the informal sector, support small businesses, and simplify the
administrative procedures. They have also prepared an amendment to the corporate income tax
law to support non-mining business activities.
Financial Sector
The Bank of Mongolia is taking action to strengthen the banking sector, enhance banking
system safety, proactively address potential systemic risks, and ensure financial stability.
The Bank of Mongolia received IMF technical assistance (TA) on enhancing systemic

5
oversight and crisis preparedness capabilities in February 2015. The Bank of Mongolia has
already started implementing the recommended actions provided by the TA by reflecting them
in its Medium term strategy on banking supervision, including phasing in measures to ensure
better risky loan recognition, improve provisioning and capital buffers, and improve risk
weights among other actions. These actions will be implemented progressively.
Conclusion
The Mongolian authorities are committed to taking decisive action to ensure macroeconomic
stability, thus laying a sound basis for longer term development. They are implementing
measures across a wide range of areas, including those identified by Fund staff, and understand
the need to further transition policy if circumstances require. Authorities greatly value ongoing
engagement with the Fund and will keep staff recommendations under close review.
