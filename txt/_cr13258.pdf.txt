STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
DISCUSSIONS

KEY ISSUES
Context: Aruba has a long history of macroeconomic stability anchored around a 40year old pegged exchange rate regime against the USD. However, two major shocks in
recent years, the global financial crisis and the shutdown of oil refining, have reversed
years of low fiscal deficits and rapidly increased both public and external debt. Recovery
is projected to be slow with real GDP reaching its pre-crisis level only in 2018. Fiscal
consolidation is planned to start this year, but the authorities have a way to go before
rebuilding the lost fiscal space.
Risks: Short-term risks are tilted to the downside given high dependence on tourism
and oil imports. Upside medium-term risks include resumption of oil refining and growth
take-off from investment in the renewable energy sector.
Policy recommendations: The main policy challenge is to ensure a steady recovery
while rebuilding fiscal policy space. Aruba’s sizable public debt (67 percent of GDP at
end-2012) and the pegged exchange rate regime argue for an ambitious consolidation
to bring public debt below 60 percent of GDP by 2018. The authorities’ goal to balance
the budget by 2016 is a step in the right direction, but measures are not yet clearly
identified. Ensuring a steady recovery will need safeguarding competitiveness through
continued market diversification in tourism, and keeping wage growth in line with
productivity developments. With slack in the economy, and adequate international
reserves, the accommodative monetary policy stance remains appropriate. Given Aruba’s
high external debt, financing through FDI will be critical for future growth initiatives,
including plans to create a growth pillar anchored on renewable energy.

KINGDOM OF THE NETHERLANDS—ARUBA

INTRODUCTION
1.
Aruba is a highly open, tourism-dependent economy with a long history of
macroeconomic stability (Figure 1). Over eighty percent of the economy depends directly or
indirectly on tourism making Aruba the second highest tourism-dependent country in the world.
The fixed exchange rate against the USD (unchanged since 1971), supported by conservative fiscal,
credit and prudential policies, has provided macroeconomic stability to Aruba’s very open economy
by maintaining low inflation and keeping imbalances checked until recent shocks. Prudent
management of the economy, in turn, together with political stability and high social development,
has earned Aruba investment grade ratings from S&P and Fitch.
2.
The main policy challenge is to ensure a steady recovery while rebuilding policy space.
Recent repeated shocks have held down economic recovery and exhausted authorities’ policy space.
The overall fiscal balance widened sharply from pre-crisis low deficits to a deficit of 8½ percent of
GDP in 2012 and public debt rose beyond what is considered prudent for a small and prone-toshock economy like Aruba. Ambitious fiscal consolidation, relying on both revenue and expenditure
measures, is needed to bring public debt below 60 percent of GDP. Ensuring a steady recovery will
also require safeguarding competitiveness and maintaining financial stability.
3.
The Fund’s previous advice focused on ensuring fiscal sustainability through the
development of a medium-term adjustment program. Recommendations highlighted the need
to include revenue measures, such as introduction of a VAT, and to improve financial situation of
Aruba’s pension and health care schemes. The authorities have taken certain measures to address
the latter (Box 2), but more needs to be done to ensure the financial soundness of these schemes
and fiscal consolidation is planned to start this year.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS, OUTLOOK AND RISKS
A. Recent Economic Developments
4.
The economy faced two major shocks in the last four years (Figure 2). The first was the
global financial crisis, which hit Aruba’s tourism sector in 2009, and the second was the shutdown of
oil refining by Valero Aruba Refinery twice for a total of 27 months during 2009-12 reflecting poor
profitability (Box 1). Real output plunged by a cumulative 15 percent during 2009-10. Although
tourism, the mainstay of Aruban economy, rebounded quickly partly thanks to the aggressive
market diversification efforts, real GDP took a second dip in 2012 by close to 1¼ percent. Output
remains 12 percent below its pre-crisis level, with recovery slower than others in the Caribbean
region. Unemployment, although declining, remains high at 9½ percent at end-2012.
5.
The external sector has weathered these shocks relatively well. The non-oil current
account (CA) balance, mostly reflecting developments in the tourism sector, has improved since
mid-2000 reaching a balanced position in 2012 (Figure 2). The overall CA balance, however, after
being in surplus for years, showed volatilities in recent years reflecting oil sector developments.
Valero’s shutdown and large income payments drove the overall CA into double-digit deficits
in 2010-11, while in 2012 a surplus of 5 percent of GDP was registered partly due to one-time sale of

inventories by Valero. Both external debt and net IIP position deteriorated in recent years, although
roll-over risks are low given 90 percent of external debt is long-term, mostly owed to parent
companies. Gross international reserves remained around 5 months of non-oil imports during recent
turbulence.

B. Outlook and Risks
Staff’s Views
6.
In 2013, real output is projected to grow by 2.3 percent. A delay in externally-financed
large investment projects is expected to cause a significant drop in private investment for two years
in a row. Robust tourism growth and some pick-up in consumption due to deflation will support the
subdued near-term recovery. A two percent deflation is projected in 2013 reflecting large utility
price reductions in late 2012, and declining food and energy prices. Water and electricity tariff rates
were reduced by 33 and 16 percent, respectively in August and November 2012 due to cost savings
from more fuel-efficient equipments. In the absence of oil exports, the overall CA balance is
projected to show a deficit of 9½ percent of GDP in 2013.
7.
Under the baseline scenario, real GDP is expected to reach its pre-crisis level only
in 2018 (Figure 2). Recent market diversification measures and the recovery in US domestic
demand are expected to hold real growth in tourism exports to around 2 percent, but the gaps in
investment and non-tourism exports left by Valero’s closure will linger. The overall CA deficit is
expected to narrow in the medium term in line with a higher services’ surplus, but remain sizable
due to income and transfer outflows, and oil trade deficits.
8.
Short-term risks are tilted to the downside, while medium-term risks are balanced (see
Risk Assessment Matrix). Renewed slowdown in the global economy, particularly in the US, poses
significant short-term risks for Aruba. Similarly, dependence on imported oil exposes Aruba to risks
of higher oil prices materializing from geopolitical events. Staff’s baseline medium-term scenario
conservatively assumes Valero’s refining operation to stay inactive. If the company finds a strategic
buyer and future prices of heavy crude ensure profitability, oil refining may resume providing a
boost to growth and the CA balance. Similarly, if investments in wind and solar energy manage to
further push down electricity costs or succeed in exporting services to South America, it will lift
growth and competitiveness. However, failure to rein in financial deficits of the old age pension
system (AOV) poses downside risks as does a further delay in investment projects.

The Authorities’ Views
9.
There was broad agreement with the staff’s analysis of economic outlook and risks.
The authorities also viewed the recovery to be gradual due to the loss of oil refining. In the short
run, they considered political/policy uncertainties in Venezuela important, carrying both negative
(lower tourist flows) and positive (higher investment flows) risks. Since political uncertainties in
Venezuela have so far not had any negative impact on tourism inflows to Aruba, staff considers
negative spillovers to be limited.

REBUILDING POLICY SPACE, SUPPORTING RECOVERY
The main policy challenge is to rebuild fiscal space while ensuring a steady recovery
through maintaining financial stability and safeguarding competitiveness.

A. Fiscal Policy: Ambitious Consolidation Needed
Background
10.
Aruba’s fiscal position deteriorated sharply in recent years. Preliminary data suggests
that the overall fiscal balance recorded a deficit of 8½ percent of GDP in 2012. The authorities have
undertaken notable reforms in recent years to address the deteriorating pension and health related
expenditure, including introducing a mandatory general pension scheme (Box 2). These measures,
along with the collection of tax arrears, were not sufficient to contain the rapid widening of the
deficit, which had been a combined result of halving of the business turnover tax (BBO) rate, rising
public sector wage bill and spending on goods and services. Public debt reached 67 percent of GDP
at end-2012, and the financing of the deficit, despite a successful bond issuance last year (a 10-year
bond of 253 million USD at a coupon of 4.6 percent which was 6 times over-subscribed), has
substantially eroded government deposits.

11.
Fiscal consolidation is planned to take hold this year. The 2013 draft budget aims to
nearly halve the deficit to 4½ percent of GDP through higher dividend payments from state-owned
enterprises, containment of wage and other current expenditures and a highly optimistic growth
outlook (5½ percent in real terms). With staff’s growth assumptions and identified measures, a
reduction of the deficit to 6 percent of GDP in 2013 is feasible but requires vigilance. Public debt will
rise further to 72 percent of GDP, with financing needs reaching 11 percent of GDP. The authorities
are contemplating issuing an external bond similar to the one issued in September 2012 in the
European market. With excess liquidity in the banking sector, maintaining current level of domestic
financing is not likely to be a problem.

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

KINGDOM OF THE NETHERLANDS—ARUBA

12.
In the medium term, headline fiscal deficits will remain elevated. Under the baseline
scenario, annual interest payments in the order of 4 percent of GDP will keep headline deficits
elevated and public debt is projected to pass 80 percent of GDP in 2017. This level of debt risks
unsustainability if shocks materialize (Appendix 1). Financial deficits of the AOV and payments for
the investment projects under the Public Private Partnerships (PPP), which are not included in staff’s
baseline scenario, will further widen the deficit. Due to depletion of reserve assets, staff estimates
that AOV’s financial deficits may add around 1 percent of GDP annually to the fiscal deficit
beginning in 2014. The annual fiscal costs from PPP projects that have been signed or under
discussion may amount up to another 1 percent of GDP starting in 2016.

creation of fiscal policy space.
For 2013, staff recommends a reduction of the deficit to 6 percent of GDP relying on authorities’
measures to reduce wage-related and goods and services expenditure. There are downside risks to
achieving this target due to parliamentary elections in September. For the medium-term, staff
recommends a consolidation of about 8 percent of GDP to reach a small surplus and bring debt to
below 60 percent of GDP.

14.
Both expenditure and revenue measures will be needed. With a large wage bill
(74 percent of tax revenue), and sizable subsidies, expenditure measures would need to lead the
consolidation (Box 3). The remainder can be met through indirect tax revenues, either by increasing
current indirect taxes, such as the BBO (at 1.5 percent, Aruba has the lowest consumption tax rate
when compared to its peers), and excise taxes and import duties, or through adopting a valueadded tax (VAT) designed to fit Aruba’s specific needs. Since the latter will likely warrant technical
assistance and long preparatory time, the authorities would need to start now if they choose to go
this way. Aruba’s income and profit tax rates are the highest in the region leaving little room for a
rate increase, but collection can be improved by reducing exemptions to foreign investors and
intensifying collection of arrears, which the authorities are pursuing.
15.
The recommended fiscal consolidation is not likely to be a major drag on economic
recovery. Available data does not allow staff to compute fiscal multipliers for Aruba, but estimates
for similar very open economies show these to be small, particularly for current expenditure and tax

multipliers.1 In the past, Aruba had achieved a much higher debt reduction within a similar
timeframe (from 60 to 40 percent of GDP during 1993-99), although growth dynamics were more
favorable.
Going forward, substaintial consolidation is needed

16.
Financial liabilities from the AOV and the PPP need to be contained. For the PPP, staff
recommended putting a limit on the size of the PPP-related expenditure commitments. Possible
reform measures to contain future transfers to AOV include: (i) raising the statutory retirement age
from its current level of 60 years; (ii) increasing pension contribution rates; and (iii) reducing pension
benefits. Given the current level of payroll taxes and relatively moderate replacement rate, the focus
should be on the first measure.

The Authorities’ Views
17.
The authorities broadly agreed with the need for fiscal consolidation, but had yet to
articulate a detailed plan and differed on measures. They plan to achieve a balanced budget
in 2016 largely relying on expenditure cuts, and some measures are subject to discussions in the
Social Dialogue. The authorities did not see room for increasing the BBO rate due to concerns for
reduced purchasing power, but thought there was scope for increasing import duties, excise taxes
and levies. They were also more optimistic in terms of revenue boost from the collection of
corporate tax arrears and the introduction of the ASYCUDA customs administration system. In
addition, they anticipate savings in interest costs through debt refinancing arrangements with the
Netherlands, which is contingent on Aruba ensuring sustainable public finances as well as
introducing a fiscal rule and establishing a Fiscal Council. The authorities are currently considering
various options for a fiscal rule, including nominal expenditure ceilings and debt rules, to be
implemented in the longer-run together with a Fiscal Council. Staff and the authorities agreed that
prior to the adoption of any fiscal rule, budgetary and fiscal monitoring infrastructure would need to

be substantially improved: a timely budget preparation, multi-year planning, and regular submission
of budgetary executions to the parliament. Currently, these deficiencies in the budgetary process
hinder effective fiscal monitoring and planning.

B. Monetary and Financial Sector Policies: Maintain Stability
Background
18.
Monetary policy remained unchanged during 2011–12. Restrictions on capital mobility
allow for some room for monetary policy action in Aruba despite the pegged exchange rate regime.
The CBA’s main policy instrument, the reserve requirement (RR), has been left unchanged at
11 percent since January 2010 in light of adequate reserves, low core inflation, and weak output
(Figure 3). Credit growth somewhat decelerated in 2012 to around 3 percent. At end-2012, excess
liquidity of the banking system stood at almost 9 percent of GDP, a reflection of weak demand and
lack of competition among banks.
19.
Commercial banks have weathered recent shocks without major strains. Preliminary
data shows that the nonperforming loans ratio has come down substantially since 2010 with
profitability indicators recovering in recent months. The aggregate capital adequacy ratio (CAR)
stood at 19½ percent at end-2012, well above the regulatory minimum of 14 percent and higher
than in the pre-crisis period. The authorities’ latest stress test results show that even under the most
severe credit shock, the CAR of the aggregate banking sector remains above the regulatory
minimum. The authorities have also taken a number of steps to enhance the AML/CFT framework
and, on this basis, have requested Aruba’s removal from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and
Caribbean Financial Action Task Force (CFATF) follow-up processes, which will be considered by the
FATF in June and the CFATF in November.
20.
The authorities have recently strengthened their framework to monitor international
reserves. A multi-tier monitoring system was introduced in September 2012 whereby four
thresholds of international reserves are set and followed.2 When actual reserves fall below any of
these thresholds, a policy response is triggered, starting from tightening of the monetary policy to
capital controls to adjustment to the peg (in the extreme case), depending on the severity of the
shortfall.

Staff’s Views
21.
With slack in the economy and projected deflation, an accommodative monetary
policy stance remains appropriate. Staff projects subdued credit growth in the near-term due to
both weak demand and tight credit standards. In case credit demand picks up, the authorities
should stand ready to mop up the excess liquidity by increasing the RR. Staff welcomes the
strengthened framework for monitoring international reserves, which will further contribute to
warding off balance of payments risks.
2

These thresholds are (i) 35% of exports, 10% of broad money and 95% of short-term debt coverage; (ii) 3-month of
CA payments coverage; (iii) 100% of short-term debt in remaining maturity coverage; and (iv) 20% of broad money
coverage.

The Authorities’ Views
22.
The authorities plan no near-term change in the monetary policy and are
contemplating moves to enhance policy transmission. They are considering legal changes that
would allow the CBA to hold government papers of more than 6 months maturity as a first step
toward open market operations. The authorities are also considering options to increase
competition, including allowing an additional player in the banking sector, and introducing a law to
cap the interest rate on consumer loans to further consumer protection and reduce borrowing costs.

24.
The CPI-based real effective
exchange rate (REER) has remained relatively stable and CGER-based estimates show no major
misalignment (Figure 4). Reflecting a narrow production base and the large need for imports that
is typical to island economies, the CA norm shows a sizable deficit. Estimates based on the CGER
methods suggest that the exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals. The macroeconomic
balance approach and estimation of equilibrium REER show a small undervaluation, while the
external stability approach, stabilizing Aruba’s NFA at its end-2012 level (-123 percent of GDP),
shows an overvaluation of around 8 percent. However, stabilizing the NFA at such high levels and
maintaining sizable CA deficits, even if justified by fundamentals, poses both stability and financing
risks.
25.
Structural competitiveness shows a more mixed picture. Aruba’s labor market is highly
regulated with a tedious lay-off process that is often associated with hefty severance pay and court
settlements favoring employees. The newly-enacted labor law somewhat relaxes restrictions, such as
making it easier to lay off employees above the retirement age, but places more restrictions on
hiring temporary workers and allowing overtime work, which are relevant for the labor-intensive
tourism sector. In addition, costs of doing business are also high in terms of licensing requirements

that could take between 3 to 6 months, unclear rules and involvement of multiple government
departments. Similarly, banks impose a fee for many types of financial transactions making access to
finance and business operations costly and cumbersome.

Staff’s Views
26.
A steady recovery requires maintaining both price and structural competitiveness.
Recent initiatives to diversify the tourism market and reduction in utility costs are a welcome effort.
With the U.S. accounting for 60 percent of tourists, there is scope for further diversification. Similarly,
the authorities’ plan to set up a second windmill park will likely reduce utility costs further. In
addition, increasing flexibility in the labor market and reducing costs of doing business will help
Aruba’s adjustment to external shocks and facilitate economic diversification. Recent increase in
gross international liabilities mostly reflects FDI inflows, somewhat reducing sustainability concerns.
Going forward, availability of such options would hinge on maintaining price and structural
competitiveness.

The Authorities’ Views
27.
The authorities agreed with staff’s analysis but did not consider structural
competitiveness to be a big obstacle. Compared to other Caribbean countries, they viewed
Aruba’s multilingual population, high standards of living, safety and security, the Dutch legal system
and modern port facilities for cruise lines as sources of strong non-price competitiveness. Also,
Aruba is one of the few countries in the region where the US customs and border patrol offers
clearance at the airport facilitating travel back to the US. They also expect the recently established
Aruba Investment Agency, a one-stop shop for investors, to ease business set up procedures.

SUSTAINING LONG-TERM GROWTH POTENTIAL
Aruba needs to increase productivity and labor participation to sustain its current
potential growth.

Background
28.
After a strong performance in the 1990s, output growth slowed down in the last
decade reflecting declining productivity. Like its peer countries that rely heavily on the laborintensive, low-tech tourism sector, productivity experienced a trend decline. As the economy’s
reliance on tourism increased further, with declining volume of refining and construction activities,
the contribution of productivity worsened.
Growth has slowed down since the 1990s.

29.
Access to credit has been somewhat of an obstacle to growth for domestic enterprises.
Credit growth, particularly to enterprises, has been low during the last decade as banks feel there is
a shortage of credit-worthy borrowers due to a lack of initial capital, proper documentation, limited
number of profitable opportunities, high risks, and legal challenges with loan recovery. The
government and the private sector are taking initiatives to educate general population about basic
financial management and how to set up small businesses.
30.
In addition to these existing challenges, Aruba faces strong headwinds to potential
growth. Absent new migration, the working age population will decline from 56 to 45 percent
by 2030. The authorities’ simulations show that, with unchanged productivity, considerable labor
migration will be needed to support the current potential growth rate of 1½ - 2 percent
beyond 2015. However, such high level of migration is likely to put pressure on housing, existing
infrastructure, and the already burdened health and education services.
31.
The authorities are pursuing a new growth pillar anchored around the renewable
energy sector. Taking advantage of Aruba’s location and abundant solar and wind resources, the
government of Aruba has a strategy of: (i) making Aruba more dependent on renewable energy;
(ii) turning Aruba into a gateway between South America, the U.S. and Europe for commerce and
investment, and (iii) establishing research laboratories. The wind energy currently supplies
15 percent of total energy needs. A second windmill park, planned to be built next year, could raise

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

KINGDOM OF THE NETHERLANDS—ARUBA

the ratio to 25 percent. The Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research (TNO)
established its Caribbean Branch Office in Aruba in 2011 for education and research with the
intention to export services to South America.

Staff’s Views
32.
The looming demographic challenge and declining productivity call for urgent labor
market actions. Aruba needs a comprehensive labor market reform to increase both participation
and productivity. Raising the mandatory general retirement age and better-targeting of social
benefits would help increase the labor force participation rate. But even with reforms, grim
demographics probably imply a need to rely on migrant workers. A sustainable migration policy in
the context of social dialogue is therefore desirable.
33.
Developing the renewable energy sector offers potential but is not without challenges.
A capital- and technology-intensive growth pillar centered on natural resources offers the right
long-term path for economic diversification. But a shortage of skilled labor may pose challenges to
its successful take-off. These initiatives will also require large upfront investment. Staff would advise
financing these projects through FDI and pace it accordingly in order to preserve the external
sustainability and keep debt servicing costs to manageable levels.

The Authorities’ Views
34.
The authorities are sanguine about Aruba’s growth prospects from the renewable
energy sector. In addition, they view renewable energy to play a catalytic role helping Aruba to
grow into a business gateway to South America in knowledge- and technology-intensive industries.
While they acknowledge constraints regarding skilled labor, they see scope to bring back Aruban
engineers working abroad. The authorities also mentioned partnership with the Carbon War Room
and view increasing the share of renewable energy to 100 percent in the long run as achievable,
although technical discussions suggest that scaling up wind energy substantially will entail
significant challenges in terms of storage and stabilization given Aruba’s grid isolation. The
authorities agreed with the staff on importance of financing through FDI.
35.
The authorities are also cautiously optimistic about the outcome of on-going off-shore
gas exploration. The government of Aruba has signed a production sharing contract for
exploration, development and production of oil and gas with REPSOL in December. Recently,
REPSOL concluded its 2D seismological mapping in the continental seabed and plans to follow up
with a 3D mapping in early 2014. The interest of REPSOL is a result of its recent success in Venezuela
where a large gas-pocket was discovered. If gas reserves are found, the production will only begin in
the long-run.

STAFF APPRAISAL
36.
Aruba is recovering slowly from recent shocks. Two major shocks in the last four years,
the global financial crisis and the shutdown of oil refining by Valero, have caused a recession that is
deeper than in most other Caribbean countries. Although tourism, the mainstay of Aruban economy,
rebounded quickly, Valero’s shutdown has left harder-to-fill gaps in investment and non-tourism
exports, with real GDP projected to reach its pre-crisis level only in 2018.
37.
Downside risks dominate in the near-term, but medium-term prospects could be
brighter. With a high dependence on tourism and oil imports, Aruba faces downside risks from
renewed weaknesses in the global economy and higher oil prices. In the medium-term, there are
upsides from resumption of oil refining by Valero, and large scale investment in renewable energy.
38.
Putting the fiscal deficit on a downward path is an immediate policy priority. The
authorities’ efforts to counter the recession through cuts in the BBO rate and higher current
expenditure have rapidly increased central government’s deficit and debt. In the absence of
exchange rate policy options, rebuilding fiscal space is an immediate priority. Staff recommends a
reduction of the overall deficit to 6 percent of GDP in 2013. To ensure this outcome, staff
recommends resisting possible expenditure pressures during the election year.
39.
In the medium-term, ambitious fiscal consolidation is needed. Without additional
measures, the central government’s fiscal deficits will remain elevated in the medium term posing
risks to public debt sustainability. Financial deficits of the AOV and payments for the PPP are likely
to further widen the deficit beginning as early as 2014. Staff recommends a consolidation of around
8 percent of GDP during 2014-18 to bring debt down to below 60 percent of GDP. To contain fiscal
pressures from financial liabilities of the AOV and the PPP, it is important to implement further
pension reforms and put a limit on the size of the PPP-related expenditure commitments.
40.
Competitiveness needs to be strengthened to ensure a steady recovery. Aruba has
managed to maintain its competitiveness in tourism through recent shocks. The non-oil CA balance
has improved in line with strong performance in the tourism sector through recent initiatives to
diversify source markets. With the US accounting for 60 percent of tourists, staff sees further scope
for market diversification. To ward off risks from a large negative IIP position, and elevated financing
requirements, Aruba would also need to strengthen its price and structural competitiveness through
higher flexibility in the labor market and more enabling business conditions.
41.
The accommodative monetary policy stance is appropriate. With slack in the economy,
projected deflation and subdued credit growth, staff sees no need for monetary tightening. The
banking system’s excess liquidity has increased substantially since mid-2012. In case credit demand
picks up, a very low risk at this point, the authorities would need to mop up the excess liquidity by
increasing the RR.
42.

It is envisaged that the next Article IV consultation discussions with Aruba will be held in

24 months time.

Box 1. Valero Oil Refinery: Recent Developments and Impact on Aruba’s Economy
Valero refines heavy crude, which is cheaper than the light variety but costlier to refine. The
profitability depends on (i) the price differential between the heavy and the light varieties; and
(ii) the cost of fuel oil used in the refining operation. Rising prices of heavy crude and fuel oil
since mid-2000 have caused Valero to repeatedly close down its production.

After a shutdown for 18 months (July 2009 -December 2010), Valero resumed its refining in 2011
only to suspend indefinitely in March 2012. The company started to reduce its workforce and
look for a strategic buyer. The number of payroll employees and sub-contractors went down
(from 639 to 574, and from 1470 to 385, respectively between end-2011 and July 2012).
In May 2012, Valero announced it had received and accepted a USD 350 million purchase offer
from Petro China Company. But the deal was put on hold pending elections in Venezuela. In
September 2012, Valero announced it would stop refining and shift its function to storage and
transshipment. The workforce was further reduced in November, leaving fewer than 100 people
on its payroll.
The refinery’s shutdown is estimated to have had a sizable impact on growth and CA
developments in 2012. As of 2011, Valero’s direct and indirect share in GDP was 7½ percent.
For 2013, the impact is mostly to be felt through higher unemployment, which may be
attenuated by the opening of the Ritz Carlton in November 2013, and possibly lower
consumption. The fiscal impact is likely to be small given Valero’s continued commitment to pay
USD 10 million in annual corporate income taxes to the government.
It is unclear when and whether Valero will resume its refining operations, which depends on the
success in finding a strategic partner (Valero is also in talks with Venezuelan state-owned
refinery) and developments in heavy crude prices. In addition to storage and transshipment,
Valero is exploring alternative business options, such as installing a liquefied natural gas terminal
and a waste to energy unit.

Box 2. Aruba—Recent Reforms in Pension and Health Care Schemes
The Government of Aruba undertook a number of measures as part of the social dialogue during 201012 aimed at improving the worsening financial situation of pension and health care schemes.
APFA (civil servants pension fund) reforms



In 2009-10, the civil servants pension fund’s finances looked increasingly unsustainable and the
authorities developed a recovery plan for APFA. The government recognized the shortfall in
the coverage of pension liabilities and committed to additional annual contributions until the
coverage ratio reaches 100 percent.



The government also reformed the benefits by (i) changing the basis for calculations from final
wage to average wage; (ii) netting out AOV pensions from the benefits; and (iii) increasing
retirement age from 55 to 60 years.

General old age pension (AOV) reforms



Due to population aging AOV has been running deficits since 2009. To mitigate the worsening
situation, the government: (i) increased the cap on pensionable income; (ii) changed benefits
base from gross to net income; (iii) individualized premium contributions; and (iv) introduced
incentives for those willing to postpone retirement beyond the mandatory age of 60.



Albeit a move in the right direction, these measures proved insufficient to reverse the
worsening of the AOV balance. Its reserves are now projected to be depleted in 2013, which
means that starting 2014 the burden of covering the deficits will fall on the budget.

Mandatory general pension
In 2012, the government introduced a mandatory pension for the private sector, with contributions set
to gradually increase to 6 percent in 2014. In the longer term, this is expected to ensure a higher
replacement rate for total pensions and thus reduce pressures on AOV to increase its benefit
payments.
General health care system (AZV) reforms



Aruba’s general health care system runs large deficits and more than 30 percent of its
spending has to be covered by transfers from central budget. The government undertook a
number of measures to contain the AZV-related spending pressures, including increasing the
premium rate by 2 percentage points and introducing caps on spending through agreements
on lump-sum payments with providers.



Most recent AZV projections suggest, however, that health care costs will be increasing and
simply containing the budget transfers will most likely create arrears in the health care sector.
Going forward, more reforms are necessary to increase revenues and contain costs by shifting
part of the costs to beneficiaries. Regional comparison shows that Aruba’s public spending on
health care as percent of GDP is one of the highest in the region.

Box 3. Aruba—Medium-Term Fiscal Consolidation: How Much and How?
How Much?
The detrimental effects of very high levels of public debt have recently been examined for the Caribbean
region. Greenidge et al. (2012) find that at 55-56 percent of GDP the debt’s effect on economic growth turns
from positive to negative. Although such thresholds are estimated to be higher for developed economies (8090 percent of GDP) and emerging market countries (60-80 percent of GDP), for small island economies like
Aruba, a lower threshold seems prudent given higher risk premia on interest rates (compared to advanced
economies) and lower potential growth (compared to emerging market economies).
Staff considers a reduction in the public debt below 60 percent of GDP by 2018 as an appropriate target.
Such an adjustment will, first of all, rebuild the fiscal space lost in the aftermath of the crisis to address risks
related to contingent liabilities, particularly growing ageing and health care related cost pressures. It will also
lower financing risks for the government, boost the economy’s resilience to shocks, and improve its growth
prospects.
How?
Reaching an overall balanced budget in 2015 and ensuring surpluses of 1 percent of GDP on average
thereafter will enable Aruba reach the above debt target. A combination of expenditure and revenue side
measures will be needed:

Additional fiscal consolidation measures, 2014-18 1/
(in percentage points of GDP)
Indirect taxes
Wages
Goods and services
Transfers and subsidies
Savings from interest expenditure



Targeting a gradual reduction in wage-related costs to their 2009 levels will produce savings of around
2 percent of GDP.



A reduction of spending on goods and services should be targeted through raising the efficiency of
public spending. Also, transfers and subsidies will need to be contained and reduced. Altogether, these
categories of spending can produce savings of around 2½ percent of GDP.



More revenues should be raised from indirect taxes. The introduction of a VAT is one potential
measure; however, this would require proper preparation. Near-term measures could include raising
the rate of the turnover tax (BBO) back to its original level of 3 percent and increasing excise taxes, thus
contributing substantially (up to 3 percent of GDP) to the consolidation efforts.



Steady implementation of the above measures will gradually improve the underlying balance which in
turn can generate savings from lower interest expenditure to the tune of 0.2 percent of GDP.

Note: The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline
path (the scenario most likely to materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of
risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline. The RAM
reflects staff views on the source of the risks and overall level of concern as of the time of the
discussion with the authorities.

1/ Central government gross debt. 2012 numbers are preliminary.
2/ Derived as [(r - p(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; p = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; a = share of foreign currency denominated debt;
and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as ae(1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flow s) remain at the level of the last projection year.

1/ Shaded areas represent actual data. Individual shocks are permanent one-half standard deviation shocks. Figures in
the boxes represent average projections for the respective variables in the baseline and scenario being presented.
Ten-year historical average for the variable is also shown.
2/ For historical scenarios, the historical averages are calculated over the ten-year period, and the information is used
to project debt dynamics five years ahead.
3/ Permanent 1/4 standard deviation shocks applied to real interest rate, growth rate, and primary balance.
4/ One-time real depreciation of 30 percent and 10 percent of GDP shock to contingent liabilities occur in 2010, with
real depreciation defined as nominal depreciation (measured by percentage fall in dollar value of local currency)
minus domestic inflation (based on GDP deflator).

STATISTICAL ISSUES
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is adequate for surveillance.
Real Sector
Real sector data are compiled by the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS). The CBS has published
national accounts data for 1995 through 2011. On the expenditure side, data on changes in
inventories are lacking. Moreover, the data on imports and exports of goods and services do not
match BOP statistics, reflecting different methodological approaches and raw sources. CPI data
are compiled and published on a monthly basis.
Government Accounts
Government finance statistics are prepared and published on a regular basis, but not reported to
STA. The presentation of the fiscal accounts could be improved in several respects. First, a
residual expenditure category “items not identified elsewhere” that can amount to 3 percent of
GDP should be disaggregated. Second, below-the-line financing does not add up to the fiscal
deficit without further adjustments. Third, each financing category has a component “other” (in
addition to disbursements and amortizations) whose nature is not clear. And fourth, the
authorities combine commercial bank financing and central bank financing into one aggregate
category “net recourse to the monetary system”. This item should be disaggregated.
External Sector
The CBA reports quarterly balance of payments and an annual international investment position
(IIP) statistics. Monthly data on the official reserve position are published with a lag of one
month. A breakdown in holdings of gold and foreign currency is provided. Data on foreign
liabilities of the monetary sector—including a breakdown by maturity and instrument—and the
central government are published on a quarterly basis, with a lag of about one quarter. A debt
survey covering both public and private sectors provides information on the amount, currency
denomination of foreign debt outstanding, as well as on disaggregation by instrument and
amortization payments coming due. Areas requiring improvement include: (i) making external
debt data consistent with debt flows in the balance of payments, and (ii) report maturity
schedules on private sector external debt.
Monetary accounts
The methodology used by the Central Bank of Aruba (CBA) for compiling monetary statistics
published in CBA’s Monthly Bulletin, Quarterly Bulletin, and Annual Statistical Digest is broadly
consistent with the IMF’s Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual 2000 (MFSM). The CBA
reports monetary data to STA on a timely basis. The authorities submit the data in the format of
Standardized Report Forms developed by STA.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
August 9, 2013

International Monetary Fund
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation with the Kingdom of the
Netherlands—Aruba
On June 26, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with the Kingdom of the Netherlands—Aruba1 and considered and
endorsed the staff appraisal without a meeting on a lapse-of-time basis.2
Aruba is a highly open economy with a long history of macroeconomic stability. Over
eighty percent of the economy depends directly or indirectly on tourism making Aruba the
second highest tourism-dependent country in the world. The long-standing fixed exchange rate
against the US Dollar, supported by conservative fiscal, credit and prudential policies, has
provided macroeconomic stability by maintaining low inflation over the years and keeping
imbalances checked until recent shocks.
The economy faced two major shocks in the last four years: the global financial crisis, which hit
Aruba’s tourism sector in 2009, and the shutdown of Valero oil refinery for a total of 27 months
during 2009-12 reflecting poor profitability. Although tourism rebounded quickly partly thanks
to aggressive market diversification efforts, real GDP took a second dip in 2012 by close to
1¼ percent after increasing by 3¾ percent in 2011. Output remains 12 percent below its precrisis level, with recovery slower than others in the Caribbean region.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.
2

The Executive Board takes decisions under its lapse-of-time procedure when the Board agrees that a proposal can
be considered without convening formal discussions.

2

The external sector has held up well through these shocks. The non-oil current account (CA)
balance, which mostly reflects developments in the tourism sector, has improved since mid2000 reaching a balanced position in 2012. The overall CA balance, however, after being in
surplus for years, showed volatilities in recent years reflecting oil sector developments. In 2012,
it recorded a surplus of 5 percent of GDP.
The fiscal position worsened significantly in recent years. Preliminary data suggests that the
overall fiscal balance recorded a deficit of 8½ percent in 2012. Notwithstanding measures taken
in the pension and health sectors and efforts to collect tax arrears, the deficit widened sharply
from pre-crisis years due to the tax rate cut and increased current expenditure. Fiscal
consolidation is appropriately planned to start this year.
In 2013, real output is projected to grow by 1¼ percent. Robust tourism growth and some pickup in consumption from projected deflation will support the subdued near-term recovery. A
two percent deflation is projected in 2013 reflecting large utility price reductions in late 2012,
and declining food and energy prices. The CA balance is projected to record a deficit of
9½ percent of GDP in 2013 due to the loss of oil exports.
Executive Board Assessment
In concluding the 2013 Article IV consultation with the Kingdom of the Netherlands—Aruba,
Executive Directors endorsed the staff’s appraisal, which made the following observations:
Aruba is recovering slowly from recent shocks. Two major shocks in the last four years, the
global financial crisis and the shutdown of oil refining by Valero, have caused a recession that is
deeper than in most other Caribbean countries. Although tourism, the mainstay of Aruban
economy, rebounded quickly, Valero’s shutdown has left harder-to-fill gaps in investment and
non-tourism exports, with real GDP projected to reach its pre-crisis level only in 2018.
Downside risks dominate in the near-term, but medium-term prospects could be brighter. With a
high dependence on tourism and oil imports, Aruba faces downside risks from renewed
weaknesses in the global economy and higher oil prices. In the medium-term, there are upsides
from resumption of oil refining by Valero, and large scale investment in renewable energy.

3

Putting the fiscal deficit on a downward path is an immediate policy priority. The authorities’
efforts to counter the recession through cuts in the business turnover tax rate and higher current
expenditure have rapidly increased central government’s deficit and debt. In the absence of
exchange rate policy options, rebuilding fiscal space is urgent. A reduction of the overall deficit
to 6 percent of GDP in 2013 is appropriate. To ensure this outcome, directors recommend
resisting possible expenditure pressures during the election year.
In the medium term, ambitious fiscal consolidation is needed. Without additional measures, the
central government’s fiscal deficit is projected to remain elevated posing risks to public debt
sustainability. Financial deficits of the old age pension system (AOV) and payments for
investment projects under the Public Private Partnerships (PPP) are likely to further widen the
deficit beginning as early as 2014. A consolidation of around 8 percent of GDP during 2014-18
is appropriate, which would bring debt down to below 60 percent of GDP. To contain fiscal
pressures from financial liabilities of the AOV and the PPP, it is important to implement further
pension reforms and put a limit on the size of the PPP-related expenditure commitments.
External competitiveness needs to be strengthened to ensure a steady recovery. Aruba has
managed to maintain its competitiveness in tourism through recent shocks partly due to
authorities’ strong initiatives to diversify source markets. With the US accounting for 60 percent
of tourists, directors see further scope for market diversification. To ward off risks from a large
negative net international investment position, and elevated financing requirements, Aruba
would also need to strengthen its price and structural competitiveness through higher flexibility
in the labor market and more enabling business conditions.
The accommodative monetary policy stance is appropriate. With slack in the economy,
projected deflation and subdued credit growth, directors see no need for monetary tightening.
The banking system’s excess liquidity has increased substantially since mid-2012. In case credit
demand picks up, a very low risk at this point, the authorities would need to mop up the excess
liquidity by increasing the reserve requirement.
