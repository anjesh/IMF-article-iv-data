Staff Report for the 2006 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for
the 2006 Consultation with Timor-Leste
Approved by Daniel Citrin and Mark Plant
December 27, 2006
•

Article IV discussions took place in Dili during March 1–14 and resumed in October 9–
20 after the mid-year civil unrest, which led to a change of government. Discussions
were held with Prime Minister Ramos-Horta, previous Prime Minister Alkatiri, Finance
Minister Boavida, General Manager of the Banking and Payment Authority De
Vasconselos, other senior officials, and representatives of donors, the business
community, and civil society.

•

In addition to Ms. Creane (head), the staff teams included Ms. Fichera, Ms. Oura, (all
APD) and Mr. Kim (FAD) in March, and Ms. Mineshima, Mr. Thomas (all APD), and
Mr. Norregaard (FAD) in October. Mr. Rasmussen (Resident Representative) assisted
both missions and Mr. Saramago (OED) joined the discussions in March. The teams
coordinated with the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.

•

The last Article IV consultation was concluded on June 15, 2005, and Directors’
comments can be found at http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pn/2005/pn0592.htm.

•

Timor-Leste uses the U.S. dollar as its official currency. It has accepted the obligations
of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, and maintains an exchange system free of
restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions.

•

Data provision to the Fund is not adequate for effective surveillance, as significant
weaknesses remain in the macroeconomic data, especially in the balance of payments
and the national accounts (Appendix II, Annex IV).

•

The authorities indicated their intention to publish the staff report and background
documents. A press statement was issued by the Resident Representative office at the
end of the consultation.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Economic and Policy Developments
•

The mid-2006 outbreak of violence and political instability disrupted private and
public sector activity. Real non-oil GDP growth in 2006 is estimated to be negative.
However, the end-year re-escalation of donor activity and higher public spending should
contribute to a sharp rebound in growth in 2007.

•

High oil and gas prices and production led to sizeable twin fiscal and current
account surpluses of 111 percent and 93 percent of non-oil GDP, respectively, in 2006.
Petroleum fund assets should exceed 250 percent of non-oil GDP.

•

Progress on reforms needed to encourage non-oil private sector activity has stalled
following the crisis. The overall business environment remains weak, the legislative
structure incomplete and the judicial system fragile.

•

Medium-term macroeconomic prospects have become more uncertain. The outlook
is highly sensitive to oil-and-gas sector developments, the still unsettled political
environment, and large-scale donor activity.

Key Policy Issues
•

The underlying policy challenge remains how best to use the oil-and-gas wealth to
lift the non-oil economy onto a higher growth path and reduce poverty. The new
government has affirmed its commitment to the long-standing economic strategy, which
the staff supports. The strategy includes stepped up public investment, adherence to an
oil-and-gas saving policy and petroleum fund, and continued macro-economic stability.

•

At the same time, the authorities need to address the physical damage caused by the
recent civil unrest and to restore law and order.

•

The 2006/07 budget targets a sharp jump in spending, focused on infrastructure,
human capital, and humanitarian assistance. The staff welcomes recent innovations to
address bottlenecks that have constrained capital spending, though emphasizing the need
to guard against unproductive spending and increasing inflationary pressure.

•

A vibrant private sector is essential for long-term growth. A stronger and more
coordinated effort is needed to improve the business environment.

•

The authorities reaffirmed their commitment to the U.S. dollar as Timor-Leste’s
currency, given its role in maintaining macroeconomic stability and still limited
institutional capacity.

4
I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Timor-Leste had made good progress in establishing the basis for a stable and
healthy economy prior to the civil unrest in 2006, though still remaining one of the
poorest countries in the world (Tables 1–2, Figure 1).1 Real non-oil GDP rose in 2004–05
after contracting for two years following the end of the post-conflict reconstruction boom.
Macroeconomic stability was achieved through the early adoption of prudent fiscal and
monetary policies. However, progress toward the country’s National Development Plan
(NDP) objectives and Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) was limited. Further, the
violence that erupted in April 2006, although now largely quelled, has introduced new risks.
Nonetheless, the onset of large oil-and-gas revenue inflows and prospects for sizable
additional revenue from new fields could still, if properly managed, transform the economy
in the period ahead.
2.
The security situation and domestic institutions remain fragile. The unrest,
involving clashes between the army and police and between communities from different
regions, was contained by the arrival of international security forces in May. However,
periodic violence continues and large numbers remain internally displaced. In addition,
persistent poverty and high unemployment amid rising expectations further contributes to
pressures on the authorities. These developments highlight the continuing vulnerabilities in
the country’s institutional capacity, notwithstanding considerable nation and capacity
building over recent years.2
3.
Against this background, increased urgency is placed on meeting the challenge
of how best to use the new oil-and-gas wealth to lift the non-oil economy onto a higher
growth path and reduce poverty. The new government endorsed the pre-existing
development strategy, set out in the NDP and related documents that comprise the Poverty
Reduction Strategy (PRSP).3 This strategy focuses on reforms to promote growth, including:
a long-term oil-and-gas revenue saving policy supported by a petroleum fund; well-targeted
development spending under the sector investment programs (SIPs); a monetary and
exchange rate regime that preserves macroeconomic stability; and a private-investmentfriendly environment. However, progress on the strategy has been uneven and non-oil growth
still falls short of that needed to reduce poverty. In the aftermath of the recent unrest, the
government plans a new Compact with donors to reinvigorate the development strategy.

Timor-Leste’s independence was restored in 2002, after two decades of Indonesian rule and two years of UN
administration.

II. THE CURRENT ECONOMIC SETTING
4.
High world oil-and-gas prices and increased output have raised projected
revenue inflows (Table 2, Figure 2). Oil-and-gas prices and production plans used to prepare

was estimated at 2 percent in 2005,
responding to a pick-up in government spending and good weather, although still below the
population growth rate of 3 percent. The acceleration of oil-and-gas production after its start
in 2004 resulted in rapid GNI growth. Inflation was low through early 2006, including
relative to competitors, as demand fell with the downsizing of the previous UN mission while
production of basic food staples increased.
6.

However, the mid-2006 civil unrest dealt a setback to the emerging recovery.

•

The unrest paralyzed the government and disrupted private sector activity. Coffee
production, the main non-oil export commodity, declined by 20 percent. Real non-oil
GDP growth is estimated to be negative (about 6 percentage points lower than projected
before the unrest), despite an end-year boost from public spending and international aid.

7.
Large oil-and-gas revenue inflows have led to sizeable external and fiscal
surpluses, notwithstanding sharply increased government spending (Tables 3-5).
•

4

Oil-and-gas revenue was 128 percent of
non-oil GDP in 2005/06, lifting the
central government surplus to 103 percent
of non-oil GDP.4 Central government
expenditure (commitments basis) of
34 percent of non-oil GDP was
13 percentage points higher than in
2004/05, but well below the annual
“sustainable” spending level determined
by the authorities’ saving policy,
estimated at 86 percent of non-oil GDP
(Box 1).

The fiscal year is July–June.

Box 1. Oil Sector Policy and Outlook
Policy Features
•

Inter-generational equity and fiscal sustainability are the objectives of the long-term fiscal
expenditure and saving policy, which should also help minimize the potential for procyclical
spending. Annual “sustainable” spending is equal to the sum of the estimated permanent (interest)
income from the oil-and-gas wealth and domestic non-oil revenue.

•

The petroleum fund is integrated into the central government budget and transparently managed.
Transfers are subject to a spending ceiling set on the basis of the fiscal sustainability policy. Fund
assets are invested abroad to limit risk and minimize real exchange rate appreciation pressures.
Designated oversight bodies monitor operations and internationally recognized accounting firms
conduct annual audits. All oil revenue is paid into the petroleum fund.

Outlook
•

High global oil prices have boosted current and potential revenue inflows. In addition, the
recently improved outlook for new oil extraction under the new treaty with Australia on the
Greater Sunrise field—where the revenue potential is estimated at about 10 billion U.S. dollars
(commencing in 2013)—and from newly tendered offshore blocks and promising onshore areas,
could further significantly raise “sustainable” budget spending over the long-term.

8
•

The steep increase in spending in the 2006/07 budget, approved in August, is designed in
large part to respond to the recent crisis. The budget includes outlays for emergency
assistance, repair of damage—including for housing reconstruction—and quick-disbursing
grants for rural communities.

On a ‘combined source’ basis, which includes the central government cash spending and
donor spending, total expenditure in 2006/07 should increase only slightly compared to pre2005/06 levels as increased government spending is largely offset by declining donor
spending.

A current account surplus of 93 percent

Bank loan quality deteriorated further, post-crisis, while private credit contracted
(Table 6). The displacement of a large number of Dili residents to outlying districts following the
crisis expanded the number of borrowers failing to make payments. At end-September 2006,
nonperforming loans (NPLs) were 30 percent of total bank lending, while banks more
aggressively provisioned for potential losses. Given still weak enforcement of creditors’ rights,
banks were increasingly reluctant to extend new loans; credit to the private sector fell by
10 percent on a year/year basis.

Reforms needed to spur non-oil private sector activity gained some momentum
prior to the crisis, but significant legal and institutional gaps remain a burden. The World
Bank ranks Timor-Leste as one of the most difficult countries for doing business. Property and
business registration remain onerous, the bankruptcy law is still pending, and an overwhelmed
court system is unable to handle commercial disputes. The implementation of new laws is
hampered by the failure to amend related legislation or adopt regulations as needed. Poor
infrastructure and lack of human capacity compound the difficulties faced in developing the nonoil economy.

Administrative capacity is improving slowly, but remains low. Service delivery for
poverty reduction has improved modestly, with some success in strengthening health indicators,
but there has been little progress in meeting other NDP/MDG objectives. Encouraging progress
has been made at the BPA. However, for the government as a whole, the number of technical
staff skilled in policy implementation remains limited. A new donor-supported Planning and
Financial Management Capacity Building Program aims to strengthen capacity.
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
13.
The discussions focused on the policies needed to lift growth to a higher sustainable
path and alleviate poverty over the medium term, while recognizing the need to respond to
the crisis in the short term. As a new country with weak institutions and infrastructure, but with
low inflation, under-utilized labor and land, no public debt and large oil-and-gas revenues,
Timor-Leste still has the potential to leap frog other low-income countries by adopting good
policies and undertaking high-return public investment. The central question of the consultations

11
was how to ensure that the macroeconomic and structural environment remains on track to make
the best use of the oil-and-gas wealth and avoid constraining growth and poverty reduction.

Review of Past Fund Surveillance
Fund Policy Advice
in 2003–04
· Maintain current monetary and exchange
regime, until institutional capacity is built and
financial markets are sufficiently developed for
the introduction of a national currency.

Status
2005 Article IV Consultation
· Dollarized regime maintained and
acknowledged as credible nominal anchor for
macroeconomic and financial stability.

2006 Article IV Consultation
· Continued commitment to current monetary
and exchange regime to allow build-up of
institutional capacity and development of financial
markets.

· Establish a long-term fiscal strategy to
ensure the productive use of oil/gas wealth
while maintaining a sustainable fiscal position
for the future.

· Legislation to establish the Petroleum Fund
and a supportive saving/spending policy aimed
at long-term fiscal sustainability and intergenerational equity was enacted, following
country-wide public consultations.

· Petroleum Fund operations started, and budget
spending plans set in line with the established
sustainability policy.

· Remove obstacles to budget execution to
allow for faster increases in well-prioritized
development spending, without creating
inflationary pressures.

· Budget programs developed under the
SIPs framework, allowing for better spending
prioritization. Public sector wage levels kept
unchanged.

· SIPs accelerated.
· New measures to improve budget execution
· Measures responding to civil unrest need to be
well targeted.
· Increase in public sector wage bill outside of
wider administrative reform a concern.

· Establish a clear legal and regulatory
framework for non-oil sector private activity.
· Strengthen capacity for effective
macroeconomic management.

· Some essential legislation passed (e.g.
investment and insurance laws). Difficulties
persist in implementation, including for
contracts enforcement given weak judiciary.
· Advanced discussions with donors for a
broad capacity building program. Good
progress with strengthening BPA capacity.

· Investment and export promotion agency
established. Other key legislation and institutions
still pending.
· Implementation of capacity building program
needs to be accelerated. MOPF macroeconomic
unit still understaffed.

Outlook for Growth and Stability
14.
The near-term outlook will be volatile in the aftermath of the crisis. The buildup of
the new UN mission and increased government spending, along with an expected gradual return
to normal business conditions and rebound from depressed conditions in 2006 should contribute
to a surge in economic growth by over 30 percent (20 percent excluding the UN) in 2007. Prices
are expected to decline as the security situation stabilizes, especially after the spring 2007
elections.

Beyond 2007, in addition to the implementation pace of the government’s
development strategy, the outlook will be sensitive to developments in oil-and-gas revenue, the

12
security/political situation, and donor activity (especially the UN and the U.S. Millennium
Challenge Account (MCA)).5
•

Under a moderate policy implementation scenario that assumes a continuation of past
policies, there should be further gradual progress in budget execution and in building the
legal and institutional framework. Government expenditure would remain within sustainable
limits. Civil service wages would rise from 7 percent to 11 percent of non-oil GDP within
the pay structure expected to be introduced in 2007. Public investment would increase by
14 percent of non-oil GDP, supporting economic growth (excluding UN activities) of 4–
5 percent per annum (Table 7 and Figure 3). Total investment would peak at 40 percent of
non-oil GDP during 2008–11. Slow progress in improving the business environment would
keep non-oil GDP growth below levels needed to significantly reduce poverty. If the fiscal
expansion is, as planned, consistent with the SIPs, infrastructure projects will mainly require
imports of basic materials, skilled labor and machinery, exerting little inflationary pressure.

Under a strong policy implementation scenario, accelerated progress in executing welltargeted development spending in infrastructure and human capital could lift total
investment to around 50 percent of non-oil GDP. More vigorous improvement in the
business environment could promote a strong pick-up in private investment in agriculture,
fisheries, and tourism. Inflation would be higher than under the baseline scenario, but still
moderate. Annual non-oil GDP growth (excluding the impact of the expected decline in the
UN mission over time) could reach 7-8 percent, contributing to a significant reduction in
poverty.

•

However, a 20 percent or steeper decline in oil-and-gas prices from current budget
assumptions would reduce annual “sustainable” spending to a level that, while above
projected spending for 2006/07, would reduce the envelope for investment spending over the
medium term and therefore pose difficulties in moving to a high-growth scenario.

•

Continued political instability and the 2007 elections could distract from the pursuit of the
reform agenda, increase pressure for public spending toward potentially more inflationary
spending, and discourage private investors.

•

Rapid assumption of large-scale external borrowing, particularly in the absence of a prudent
debt-management strategy, could quickly erode fiscal sustainability.

Authorities’ views: The authorities agreed that growth of 7–8 percent over the medium term
was necessary to ensure a sustained decline in poverty and that it would require a major step-up
in public investment, along with an increase in private investment and the continuation of a
sound macroeconomic environment. In their view, these growth rates were within reach given
plans for increased development spending, including the MCA funding.
Fiscal Issues: Managing Oil-and-Gas Wealth Through Development Spending for Investment
and Growth
16.
The long-term fiscal sustainability strategy, targeting inter-generational equity
through the savings policy and petroleum fund, remains an appropriate vehicle for broad
management of the oil-and-gas wealth.

14
•

Adherence to the saving guideline and keeping spending within “sustainable” levels, along
with continued prudent management of the petroleum fund should help shield Timor-Leste
from the “oil curse” by smoothing spending and investing the remainder abroad, while
financing the needed increase in development spending.

•

The Fund’s institutional arrangements are now largely completed with the first meeting of
the Consultative Council in November. Transparent reporting, independent audits, and the
creation of an Investment Advisory Board for the Fund have ensured a high level of
accountability.6

•

The petroleum fund’s investment strategy is defined within a well-articulated asset
management framework. MCM is providing support to strengthen capacity at the BPA to
manage the Fund’s assets.

Authorities’ views: Notwithstanding the rapid accumulation of oil-and-gas savings in the Fund,
the authorities consider the current conservative investment strategy to be appropriate during
these initial years, given their low level of capacity in asset and risk management. However,
looking forward, the authorities plan to initiate use of multilateral institutions’ fund managers to
bring into play the gradual diversification allowed within the law.
17.
At the same time, the crisis has made the need for significantly stepped-up
development spending more pressing, particularly in human capital and infrastructure
(Box 2).
•

High unemployment, low productivity and sluggish activity suggest that well-targeted public
investment with a high import content could support higher growth without increasing
inflation. As a share of non-oil GDP, total public sector spending is not expected to increase
appreciably, although the central government’s share would rise as that of donors declines.

•

Nonetheless, the risks of inflation and non-priority spending are higher with the sharp
increase in expenditure. In addition, the 2006/07 budget appropriation is just within
“sustainable” levels. Although cash spending is likely to be lower than that appropriated
given continuing budget execution problems, as spending rises and the budget constraint
tightens, it is increasingly critical that spending be carefully prioritized.

•

To that end, some elements of 2006/07 budget expenditure raise concerns. Fast-disbursing
emergency cash grants should be carefully targeted and transparently provided to those
affected by the crisis to minimize the long-term impact on the fiscal accounts, inflation and
growth. Greater wage differentiation in the public sector is needed to attract qualified senior
staff, but increases in wages for unskilled staff—such as through the across-the-board cost-

of-living subsidy—could put upward pressure on private sector wages and reduce
competitiveness.
Box 2. Fiscal Expansion: Benefits and Risks
Significant development needs. Timor-Leste is one of the poorest countries in the world
(Figure 1). Long-standing development needs further increased with the damage and humanitarian
problems resulting from the mid-year crisis. As private investment is very low and likely to remain
so over the medium-term, the burden is largely on the government to address the problems and to
invest heavily to ensure that the new oil wealth raises living standards and reduces poverty.

Notwithstanding the development and humanitarian needs, rapid fiscal expansion carries
risks. Much higher public expenditure could result in a build up of pressure on non-tradeable goods’
prices that would impair non-oil private sector competitiveness. However, under the SIPs, benefits
are expected to outweigh costs:
•
•
•
•

SIPs investment in infrastructure and human capital are complementary to private investment
and should support growth, absorb employment, and raise factor productivity in the wider
economy.
Expenditure is likely to be on traded goods, such as imported capital equipment, or on unskilled
labor and other services not in limited supply in the domestic market, and therefore less likely to
trigger rapid increases in prices and wages.
Aggregate public spending is not expected to increase overall, relative to the reconstruction
period as the component financed by Timor-Leste’s own resources replaces donor financing.
Experience in other open, low-income, oil-producing economies with fixed exchange rates has
shown that large expenditure increases may be absorbed without a major inflationary impact.

Authorities’ views: The authorities observed that the 2006/07 budget responds to the need to
accelerate execution of development spending under the SIPs, which continue to guide budget
planning, and for humanitarian relief. Capital expenditure is budgeted to rise to 32 percent of
GDP in 2006/07. Given the sharp expenditure increase, the authorities were well aware of the
need to avoid putting pressure on prices and nonproductive expenditure. The higher government
wage bill reflects plans to fill long-vacant management positions and the one-off cost-of-living
adjustment in 2006/07 will offset crisis-related costs for public servants and be subsumed in a
new pay and grading structure in 2007, which will include the first pay rises since 2002.
18.
As weaknesses in the budget process continue to constrain needed development
spending, new measures within the 2006/07 budget aim to improve execution.
•

The 2006/07 budget incorporates new measures to raise execution levels, including greater
use of rural development and education cash grants; international outsourcing of design,
implementation, and monitoring of capital projects; and procurement decentralization with
technical support from donors.

•

Adoption of the pending public-finance management law (including improved commitment
monitoring and controls) would strengthen the fiduciary framework, expenditure execution,
and the medium-term budget framework.

Authorities’ views: The authorities are optimistic that technical assistance from the new IMF
treasury advisor and other donors will boost budget planning, execution, and monitoring
capacity. At the same time, they acknowledged that the effect of the measures to improve budget
execution could take time to be fully realized given the low level of capacity. They plan to limit
the growing carryover to capital expenditure in addition to instituting re-appropriation
requirements.
19.
Against this background, the authorities should proceed cautiously when giving
consideration to breaking past practice to engage in large-scale external borrowing.
•

It will be important to carefully weigh borrowing opportunities to ensure that the project to
be financed is consistent with SIP priorities, the absorptive capacity of the economy, and
debt management capacity within the government. A rigorous cost-benefit analysis should
be undertaken to carefully assess the concessionality of the terms and conditions of the
proposal to ensure that these do not prejudice future economic growth or resource
management.

•

Consideration of external borrowing projects should also be handled in a fully transparent
manner in line with normal budget procedures.

Authorities’ views: The authorities agreed with the need to look closely at the terms and
conditions of any borrowing opportunity, as well as its potential macroeconomic impact. They

17
viewed concessional borrowing as a means to finance priority infrastructure projects necessary
for raising economic growth.
20.
The favorable outlook for oil-and-gas revenue also provides a good opportunity to
update the tax policy regime and reduce non-oil taxes without compromising fiscal
sustainability.
•

The current tax policy regime acts as a drag on the narrow base of the non-oil sector,
encouraging noncompliance. At the same time, it is a challenge to administer. Simplifying
the tax structure—including by increasing minimum thresholds and reducing rates, and
streamlining tax procedures—would be investment-friendly, reduce incentives for
avoidance, and better suit the continued low administrative capacity.7

•

New oil-and-gas operations also require stepped-up capacity to audit tax compliance.

•

A consolidated tax law, which has been pending for over a year, would improve taxpayer
awareness and remove ambiguities.

Authorities’ views: The authorities agreed that tax policy reform is a high priority. They
welcomed the initial FAD tax-policy review and indicated that substantive actions would follow
the full TA mission planned for January.
Monetary and Financial Sector Issues: Maintaining Macroeconomic Stability
21.
The use of the U.S. dollar as legal tender has supported macroeconomic stability by
providing a credible nominal anchor for low inflation. The authorities reaffirmed their
commitment to the current monetary and exchange arrangements, which have been key to
maintaining macroeconomic stability. They agreed with staff that the current level of the
exchange rate does not present concerns for competitiveness, but that there was need to remain
vigilant to ensure that fiscal pressures do not undermine competitiveness in the future. They also
agreed that stronger institutional capacity and well-functioning financial markets are prerequisites to the introduction of a national
50
currency.

•

The initial rapid expansion of bank credit to the private sector in the first half of 2004 in part
represented a re-intermediation of the financial sector as the macroeconomic and political
situation stabilized.

•

The more recent deceleration in credit growth parallels developments in non-oil activity and
the rising share of NPLs. The latter largely reflects weak credit assessment policies at one
commercial bank (which have been addressed), combined with difficulties in contract
enforcement and loan recovery, exacerbated by the recent civil unrest.

1/ Applies to IMFTL only as other banking institutions are branches of foreign banks.

•

The worsening quality of banks’ portfolios is unlikely to pose serious risks for depositors
given that all three banks in Timor-Leste are branches of established foreign banks.
However, a slowdown in financial intermediation could reduce credit availability and
hamper the recovery.

•

Unless operated on a commercial basis, a state-owned rural development bank as now under
consideration could quickly run into NPL and solvency issues, leading to fiscal liabilities
and further undermining development of the formal banking sector.

•

Given current difficulties in enforcing loan contracts, an alternative means of resolving
disputes is needed. In addition, land-registration legislation and commercial code
regulations, both critical for a well functioning financial sector, need finalization.

•

Other key legislation, including the Central Bank, Payments, and Anti-Money Laundering
laws, are also still pending.

Authorities’ views: The authorities pointed to the need to continue monitoring credit
developments closely and to strengthen the environment for financing in the future. The BPA has
taken steps to: establish a credit registry to help screen creditor quality; enhance bank
supervision, including the resumption of off-site supervision with assistance from the Fund; and
push for submission of the Central Bank Act to Parliament. In addition, as noted below, the
authorities are considering introduction of an alternative commercial dispute mechanism.
Private Sector Development and Capacity Building for Long-term Growth
23.
For private non-oil activity to become the source of long-term growth and job
creation, the business environment needs considerable strengthening.

19
•

Priorities include the need to pass the still-pending land law and to address the absence of
effective contract enforcement. Cumbersome business licensing procedures could be
streamlined. Institutions for mediation and arbitration could provide alternatives for settling
commercial disputes while the law courts are being reinforced. Greater consultation with the
private sector in developing and implementing laws and regulations could help ensure their
effectiveness.

•

Given high levels of unemployment, setting a binding minimum wage and adopting costly
hiring and firing provisions would be counterproductive.

•

A government coordination unit to guide the legislative and regulatory agenda could ensure:
(a) appropriate consideration of laws’ economic and social impact, (b) adoption of needed
implementing regulations and amendments, (c) easy access to laws and regulations for the
general public, and (d) adequate training of officials to implement the new framework.

Authorities’ views: The authorities are committed to intensifying ongoing programs to improve
the business climate and encourage private investment. Foreign investors have supported the
proposals for the long-term leasing of state-owned land. Consultation with the business
community is also identifying areas for reducing red tape and new training programs for civil
servants should improve service provision. Proposed changes to labor legislation will be
carefully evaluated to avoid hindering employment creation. Options are advancing for more
effective handling of commercial disputes. However, other action on laws and regulations is
likely to remain constrained by low capacity.
Other Issues
24.
Macroeconomic analysis remains hampered by weak capacity and poor data
availability. The lack of qualified candidates hinders recruitment for national accounts
compilation and the macroeconomic unit in the finance ministry. In the absence of national
accounts and balance of payments statistics, the authorities have begun producing quarterly
macroeconomic indicators of non-oil activity based on existing data available in various parts of
the administration. Formal responsibility for balance of payments statistics has been transferred
to the BPA, where capacity is stronger.
25.
Timor-Leste maintains an open trade regime, with a uniform 6 percent duty on all
imports and no quantitative restrictions.

20
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
26.
Timor-Leste has made good progress in stabilizing the macroeconomy and
establishing a foundation for future growth. At the same time, growth is not yet high enough
to reduce poverty and the recent civil unrest has heightened the risks to the outlook. While
recognizing the need to address the short-term consequences of the crisis, the underlying
challenge is how best to use the oil-and-gas resources and the stable macroeconomic
environment to lift the non-oil economy onto a higher growth path.
27.
The authorities’ development strategy remains sound and focuses on the core
reforms needed to promote growth: a long-term oil-and-gas revenue saving policy supported
by a petroleum fund; well-targeted and prioritized development spending; maintenance of a
monetary and exchange regime that preserves macroeconomic stability; and an appropriate
environment for private investment and activity. Progress on some elements of the strategy has
been stronger than on others and success will require more forceful progress in all areas.
28.
By targeting long-term fiscal sustainability and intergenerational equity, the saving
rule and Petroleum Fund should help shield Timor-Leste from the “oil curse” by smoothing
spending and investing the remainder abroad, while leaving sufficient resources to finance the
needed increase in development spending. The authorities are encouraged to continue transparent
reporting of its activities.
29.
A significant stepping up of investment spending is needed and feasible given the
absence of a binding financing constraint. That said, large increases in government spending
intensify the need to guard against unproductive spending and inflation pressures through careful
planning and monitoring. The increase in public sector wage levels could put upward pressure on
private sector wages for unskilled workers. Subsidies should be monitored carefully to ensure
effectiveness.
30.
Measures to strengthen budget execution are welcome, but further reforms are
necessary. The introduction of education and community grants, international outsourcing of
large infrastructure projects, additional donor support and procurement decentralization are
likely to speed up budget implementation over time. Additional measures are needed to
strengthen the budget process, including an effective public finance law and improved
monitoring and control on a cash basis.
31.
Proposals to borrow externally should be carefully weighed. Rigorous and transparent
analysis should be undertaken to ensure the project’s consistency with SIP priorities and
macroeconomic stability, and the adequate concessionality of its terms.
32.
The increase in oil revenues enables wide-ranging tax reforms. A simplified tax
regime, including a reduction in tax rates and an increase in minimum thresholds, could help to
encourage the private sector. Tax procedures should also be streamlined to better fit limited
administrative capacity.

21
33.
Maintenance of the current monetary and exchange regime provides a credible
anchor for maintaining macroeconomic stability. The current level of the exchange rate is not
a threat to medium-term competitiveness, though the authorities should remain vigilant to ensure
that expansionary fiscal and wage policies do not increase price pressures. Staff welcomed the
authorities’ position that stronger institutional capacity and a well-functioning financial market
were pre-requisites to the introduction of a national currency.
34.
The weakening in banks’ loan portfolios does not appear to present a systemic risk.
Nonetheless, it may reduce credit availability and undermine the economic recovery. Staff
welcomes plans to further strengthen supervision, create a loan registry, introduce an alternative
means of resolving commercial disputes, and finalize banking sector legislation. A state-owned
rural-development bank could further weaken the fragile financial system, if not operated on a
commercial basis.
35.
Greater efforts are needed to create an environment that encourages private
investment and growth. Passage of the pending land law would support private investment,
while amendments to the labor legislation under preparation should encourage greater labor
market flexibility. The creation of a coordination unit to guide the legislative and regulatory
agenda would be useful.
36.
The recently launched donor-supported capacity building program is welcome and
should help improve financial management. Staffing the Ministry of Finance’s
macroeconomic unit is a priority. Given data are not adequate for effective surveillance,
intensified efforts are needed to strengthen statistical capacity to compile basic macroeconomic
data.
37.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be conducted on the standard 12month cycle.

Sources: Data provided by the Timor-Leste authorities; and Fund staff estimates.
1/ Non-oil GDP and national accounts data for 2001–03 are based on estimates prepared by a World Bank consultant.
2/ CPI for Dili.
3/ Excludes oil/gas sector investment.
4/ Fiscal year basis (July-June); for example, 2001 refers to FY2001/02. Includes automous agency expenditure.
5/ Includes autonomous agencies and fiscal and quasi-fiscal expenditure programs undertaken by bilaterals and multilaterals outside the
central government budget. The revenue decline in FY 2005/06 reflects the adoption of the new savings and petroleum fund policy according
to which oil revenue accrue to the petroleum fund and the sustainable income from the oil wealth is transferred to the budget to finance the
non-oil fiscal deficit.
6/ Excludes currency holdings by the public, for which no data are available.
7/ Excludes oil/gas revenue, which are recorded under the income account (royalties) and transfers (tax revenues). Also excludes
re-exports, which primarily relate to repatriation of equipments from UN peacekeeping operations.

Sources: Timor-Leste authorities; and Fund staff estimates.
1/ Fiscal year: July-June. Central Government includes subsidies to autonomous agencies.
2/ Oil revenue projections for the period 2006/07-2009/10 are based on August 2006 budget assumptions for price and production.
3/ Staff projections are based on past ratios of actual commitments and cash disbursements to budgeted allocations.
4/ Includes allocation for BPA capitalization ($10.5 million in 2006/07).
5/ Cash expenditure includes carry-over expenditure from previous years (the reporting of which is not disaggregated).
The carry-over is reportedly largely capital expenditure, as most recurrent expenditure is executed in the budgeted year.
6/ It includes the permanent income from oil (estimated in line with the Petroleum Fund law) and projected domestic revenue and grants.

1/ Based on March 2006 revised SIPs spending proposals and requests for project financing by donors, implementation of the oil fund and fiscal sustainability
policy starting in FY 2005/06 and Fund staff projections for central government revenue and expenditure.
2/ Oil gas revenue are not included as a budget revenue item and flow directly to the petroleum fund. The amount necessary to cover the non-oil fiscal
deficit is withdrawn from the fund transferred to the budget up to the estimated sustainable income level and recorded as a financing item.
3/ Includes sector projects which the government has identified as necessary to achieve NDP and MDG objectives, but for which donor financing is not yet fully
committed.
4/ For ease of comparison over time, oil/gas revenue in 2004/05 (ahead of the establishment of the petroleum fund) are included in the line of oil fund financing.
5/ New project financing requested from donors; still uncommitted.

APPENDIX I. SUMMARY OF ANNEXES
The full annexes to this report can be viewed in CyberDocs on the Fund’s intranet and on the
secure extranet for Executive Directors and member officials.
Fund Relations
Timor-Leste joined the Fund in July 2002, and has no outstanding purchases or loans. On
January 24, 2000, the U.S. dollar was adopted as the official currency and foreign exchange
transactions are handled by commercial banks on the basis of rates quoted in the international
markets. The 2005 Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on
June 15, 2005 (http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/cat/longres.cfm?sk=18427.0).
Relations with the World Bank Group
Timor-Leste joined the World Bank Group in July, 2002 and became eligible for IDA
assistance in October, 2002. Thus far there has been no lending. During the transition to
independence, the World Bank co-managed a multi-donor Trust Fund for East Timor
(TFET). Bank-administered TFET projects reached $112 million, of which $105 million was
disbursed by mid-December 2006. The Bank has mobilized budget support with the most
recent, Consolidation Support Program 2006–08, providing about $10 million annually, with
about $0.5 million financed by IDA. The latest Country Assistance Strategy (2006–08) was
adopted in July 2005 and provides for new programs in education, health, energy, and public
finance capacity building, with IDA grants of about US$25 million. Timor-Leste joined the
IFC in September 2004.
Relations with the Asian Development Bank
Timor-Leste joined the Asian Development Bank (AsDB) on July 24, 2002. To date, there
has been no lending. The AsDB co-managed TFET with the World Bank. Under the TFET,
the AsDB has managed six projects with total funding of $51.7 million, which aimed at the
rehabilitation of physical infrastructure and the development of microfinance. At midDecember 2006, disbursements for AsDB-managed projects totaled $50.8 million. Most
projects were completed at the end of 2004 with only one project ongoing, with completion
expected by February 2007. The AsDB has also approved 27 technical assistance programs
totaling $12.2 million, with 10 ongoing as of end-January 2006.
Statistical Issues
Data provision to the Fund is not adequate for effective surveillance, as significant
weaknesses remain in the macroeconomic data, especially in the balance of payments and the
national accounts. Institutional capacity remains very limited, and availability and quality of
data are very weak.

On January 24, 2000, the U.S. dollar was adopted as the official currency of then
East Timor by the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor
(UNTAET). This arrangement has been maintained after Timor-Leste’s
independence on May 20, 2002. At present, the monetary authority does not
undertake foreign exchange transactions; they are handled by commercial banks
on the basis of rates quoted in the international markets.
VIII. Article IV Consultations
The 2005 Article IV consultation discussions with the authorities were held
during March 10–25, 2005. The Executive Board discussed the staff report
(http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/cat/longres.cfm?sk=18427.0) and concluded
the consultation on June 15, 2005.
IX.

Technical Assistance
Since late 1999, a significant amount of technical assistance has been
provided by the Fund as part of the international community’s efforts to

3
reconstruct the Timor-Leste economy. The Fund’s technical assistance has
focused on establishing key economic institutions (especially fiscal and
monetary authorities) essential for macroeconomic management, as well
as on developing local capacity to manage them. It also played a key role
in the adoption of a new currency arrangement based on the U.S. dollar.
Between late 1999 and end–2006, Timor-Leste has been one of the largest
recipients of Fund technical assistance.
FAD: A series of multi-topic FAD missions took place early on to establish and
develop the Central Fiscal Authority (CFA, February 2000), which developed into
the Ministry of Planning and Finance. Assistance was provided to develop budget
preparation, establish tax policy and administration, strengthen treasury and
expenditure management, and advise on oil sector fiscal regimes. Long-term
resident advisors were assigned to the Ministry of Planning and Finance and the
Revenue Service of Timor-Leste to cover a wide range of issues, partly under a
cost sharing arrangement with the UN. Over August 2004–July 2005, a FAD
resident advisor assisted in the design and establishment of the Petroleum Fund,
which started operations in August 2005. A FAD resident advisor to the Treasurer
of the Ministry of Planning and Finance started work in December 2006 to help
strengthen expenditure management, reporting and budget execution.
LEG: A number of LEG missions have been to Timor Leste to advise the
authorities on key fiscal and financial legislation. These included the customs law
and directives, income tax legislation, the budget and financial management law,
and banking regulations (relating to the monetary authority, the banking system,
and the payments system). Jointly with MFD (now MCM), technical assistance
has recently been provided to assist the authorities in drafting an AML/CFT Law.
LEG has also recently provided assistance, in collaboration with FAD, for the
drafting of the Petroleum Fund Act, and in collaboration with MCM, for the
drafting of the Central Bank Law.
MCM: A large number of missions took place early on to establish and develop
the Central Payments Office (CPO, January 2000), which was transformed
subsequently into the Banking and Payments Authority (BPA) (November 2001).
Assistance was provided to establish a payment system, prepare banking
legislation, and develop key functions of the monetary authority, including
banking supervision, asset management, accounting, and organization and
management. Assistance was also provided on the introduction of a dollar-based
currency system and to issue domestic coins to supplement the use of U.S. dollar
coins. More recently, assistance has been provided to (i) draft the insurance law
and develop a framework for insurance supervision, (ii) strengthen banking
supervision, (iii) address a broad range of issues relating to money laundering and

4
financing of terrorism, (iv) establish and train the investment unit responsible for
managing petroleum fund assets (a resident adviser commenced in March 2005),
(v) prepare for the establishment of the central bank, (vi) design of a more
effective organizational structure at the BPA, and (vii) modernize payment
systems, and accounting for the Petroleum Fund. In addition, long-term resident
advisors, including on banking supervision, payments, and accounting, have been
assigned to the CPO and the BPA under a cost sharing arrangement with the UN.
Since early 2005, a long-term advisor has been assisting the BPA general
manager.
STA: A multi-sector statistical mission took place in November 2000 to assess
the availability and quality of official macroeconomic data, and help establish the
Statistic Division of the Ministry of Planning and Finance. A long term statistical
advisors was provided over the period November 2001-October 2005. A
peripatetic statistical advisor is expected to be appointed in 2007 to assist the
authorities in improving data compilation and developing local capacity to
prepare national accounts and balance of payments statistics (responsibility for the
latter was transferred to the BPA in 2006).

Resident Representative
A resident representative office was established in Dili in August 2000. The
current resident representative, Mr. Tobias Nybo Rasmussen assumed the post in
February 2006.

5
ANNEX II. TIMOR-LESTE: RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
(As of December 19, 2006)
1.
Timor-Leste joined the World Bank Group on July 23, 2002. It became eligible for
IDA assistance on October 9, 2002. Thus far, there has been no lending to Timor-Leste,
reflecting the authorities’ policy to avoid external borrowing, including concessional loans.
However, the World Bank has been actively involved in the reconstruction and development
of the economy since late 1999, by playing a key catalytic role in mobilizing and
coordinating international assistance to Timor-Leste. Timor-Leste also joined IFC in
September 2004 and, together with the Pacific Enterprise Development Facility, an office
was opened in Dili in 2006.
During the transition to independence, the World Bank’s involvement centered
around its role as trustee and co-manager of the Trust Fund for East Timor (TFET), which
was established in December 1999 as a vehicle to provide grant assistance for reconstruction
activities and economic development in Timor-Leste.1 Under the TFET, which is comanaged with the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the World Bank has administered
projects relating to social services (especially health and education), agriculture, private
sector development, community development and governance, economic capacity building,
and petroleum sector development. Total funding for the World Bank-administered TFET
projects reached $112 million, of which $105 million was disbursed by mid-December 2006.
2.

3.
In addition to its involvement through the TFET, the World Bank has also been
playing a key role in mobilizing budgetary assistance for the post-independence period
through an annual multi-donor budget support operation. The Transition Support Program
(TSP) from FY 2003 to 2005, was followed by the Consolidation Support Program (CSP)
from FY 2006 to 2008, to reflect the shift from post-conflict transition to consolidation of
gains made thus far. The TSP programs brought about $30 million in budget support
annually with about $5 million financed by IDA, and the balance financed by 9 bilateral
partners. The CSP programs will bring about $10 million in budget support annually, with
about $0.5 million financed by IDA. Both the TSP and the CSP programs focus on three
thematic areas: (1) good governance, including developing a legal framework for governance
and the judiciary and strengthening public expenditure management; (2) service delivery for
poverty reduction, particularly in education and health; and (3) job creation, especially
through private sector development, agriculture, and improvements in basic infrastructure.
4.
The CSP I was approved by the Board in October 2005. A CSP progress mission in
November 2005 concluded that developments had been positive and that the Government is
likely to achieve its FY 2006 goals. This mission stressed however the need for actions
conducive to faster private sector development. A CSP II appraisal mission in early March
2006 concluded that developments continue positive and three issues exist and need

Pledges to the TFET were made by 12 donors, including the European Commission and the World Bank, with
the total amount of funds reaching $178 million. This comprises donors’ contributions of $167 million
(including $10 million by the World Bank) and investment income of $9 million. Of this total, $160 million was
disbursed by end-April 2006. TFET projects are expected to wind down by end-2007.

resolution: (i) law to harmonize legislation in the country is still pending approval,
(ii) procurement is the major bottleneck for expanding government expenditures, and
(iii) private sector development needs to be brought to the core of the country’s reform
program. The TSPs and CSPs have been praised by Government and donors alike for their
beneficial effect on: (i) capacity building in Government prioritization; (ii) oversight over
budget execution given the current weakness of internal oversight institutions; and (iii) donor
coordination.
5.
The World Bank has also provided analytical and advisory services, including
through a Country Economic Memorandum, a Poverty Assessment, a Public Expenditure
Management and Accountability Note, a Public Expenditure Review, an Education Sector
Review, and a Paper on Strengthening the Institutions of Governance in Timor-Leste. The
“Doing Business” report for 2006 featured Timor-Leste for the first time. Additional support
is underway with respect to financial and private sector development, health sector
development including population growth challenges, and issues pertaining to youth. The
World Bank is also contributing to the FIRST Initiative's Technical Assistance Project for the
Establishment of a Credit Registry.
6.
In July 2005 the World Bank adopted a Country Assistance Strategy for FY 2006–08
that focuses on: (i) delivering sustainable services; (ii) creating productive employment; and
(iii) strengthening governance. In addition to the annual CSP program the CAS provides for
new programs in education, health, energy, and public finance capacity building, for a total
amount of IDA grants of about US$ 25 million. The Planning and Financial Management
Capacity Building Project was approved in March 2006; this program amounts to $37 million
with $7 million from IDA and $30 million from development partners. Timor-Leste has
recently also been awarded $8.2 million from the Education For All Fast Track Initiative
(FTI) Catalytic Fund, the first post-conflict country to benefit from the initiative.
7.
Prior to Timor-Leste’s restoration of independence, the World Bank co-chaired six biannual donors’ meetings. After independence, the World Bank has co-chaired the TimorLeste and Development Partners Meeting (TLDPM) with the Government of Timor-Leste.
The TLDPM has taken place in December 2002, June 2003, December 2003, May 2004,
April 2005 and April, 2006. The sixth and latest TLDPM concluded that: (i) with key
institutions of governance established, Timor-Leste enjoys an unique opportunity to
sustainably increase spending on much needed services; (ii) in the short-term, well targeted
public investments harbor the greatest potential for job creation and poverty reduction; and
(iii) vigorous actions towards improving a private sector enabling environment are needed for
longer term growth.

ANNEX III. TIMOR-LESTE: RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
(As of December 15, 2006)
1.
Timor-Leste joined the Asian Development Bank (AsDB) on July 24, 2002. To date,
there has been no lending to the country. However, like other international financial
institutions and bilateral donors, the AsDB has been actively involved in the reconstruction
and development of the economy since late 1999.
2.
The AsDB’s involvement has centered around co-managing with the World Bank the
Trust Fund for East Timor (TFET), which was established in December 1999 as a vehicle to
provide grant assistance for reconstruction activities and economic development in TimorLeste.2 Under the TFET, the AsDB has managed six projects with total funding of
$51.7 million,3 which aimed at the rehabilitation of physical infrastructure (urban and rural
power, national roads, ports, and water and sanitation) and the development of microfinance.
In the wake of the post-referendum destruction, the focus of the projects was on providing
emergency assistance, but subsequently shifted to meeting the country’s long-term
development needs. AsDB has prepared a “consolidation” phase program to be funded
predominantly from Asian Development Fund grants ($16 million over 4 years) and technical
assistance (about $4 million over 4 years). This phase comprises a more sharply focused
program (infrastructure development and associated technical assistance for main roads and
urban water supply and sanitation only) and strategies to leverage AsDB support by helping
the Government to program and coordinate infrastructure development. At mid-December
2006, disbursements for AsDB-managed projects totaled $50.8 million. Most projects were
completed at the end of 2004. Only one project (EIRP-2) is ongoing, with completion
expected by February 2007.
3.
The AsDB has also been actively involved in technical assistance. Thus far, the
AsDB has approved 27 technical assistance programs totaling $12.2 million. Most technical
assistance programs have been undertaken in parallel with the implementation of the TFETfunded projects, focusing on project preparation and sector-specific capacity/institution
building essential for project implementation. The latter includes the development of
regulatory and legislative frameworks, the analysis of sectoral policy issues, poverty
assessment and statistics, and strategies for economic and social development and planning.
As of end-January 2006, 16 technical assistance programs were completed and 10 programs
continued.

See footnote 1 in Relations with the World Bank Group.

These projects comprise the Emergency Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project ($29.8 million); the Emergency
Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project 2 ($9 million); the Water Supply and Sanitation Rehabilitation Project
($4.5 million); the Water Supply and Sanitation Rehabilitation Project 2 ($4.5 million); the Hera Fisheries Port
Facilities Rehabilitation Project ($1 million); and the Microfinance Development Project (originally $4 million,
but reduced to $2.7 million).

ANNEX IV. TIMOR-LESTE: STATISTICAL ISSUES
Data provision to the Fund is not adequate for effective surveillance, as significant
weaknesses remain in the macroeconomic data, especially in the balance of payments and the
national accounts. Prior to 1999, macroeconomic data were compiled by the Indonesian
Central Bureau of Statistics (Badan Pusat Statistik, BPS) and the Central Board of Statistics
of the East Timor Province. Balance of payments statistics were almost nonexistent as
Timor-Leste was treated as one of the Indonesian provinces. Data compilation was seriously
disrupted in 1999, as the post-referendum turmoil destroyed databases, and institutional
capacity collapsed after most Indonesian statistical officers left.
During reconstruction, international financial institutions and bilateral donors provided
technical assistance. To this end, a multi-sector Fund statistics mission visited Dili in
November 2000 and assisted the authorities in establishing objectives for restoring economic
statistics and in setting up a Statistical Division in the Ministry of Planning and Finance in
2001. A long-term resident statistical advisor assisted the Statistical Division during
November 2001–February 2004, and was succeeded by a new resident advisor until
September 2005. Unfortunately, progress has been minimal, as resources at the Statistical
agency are insufficient to compile a wide range of social and economic statistics. Institutional
capacity remains very limited, and availability and quality of data are very weak.
National accounts
Under a World Bank-financed project, national accounts data for 2000 (both sector and
expenditure basis) were estimated by the Boston Institute for Developing Economies (BIDE).
In late 2004, BIDE, under a follow-up World Bank project, produced GDP estimates for
2001-2003 that suffer from limited source data and substantial extrapolation. The Division of
Statistics has not been able to replicate the BIDE estimation exercise for 2004. Consequently,
estimates of GDP (including for the oil sector) have been prepared by Fund staff. To improve
national accounts data, appropriate staff and substantial efforts at data collection and
elaboration are needed. The authorities have secured a commitment from the World Bank for
continued support on national accounts.
Prices, employment, and wages
Since 1999, a consumer price index has been compiled monthly for Dili and quarterly for the
whole country, with April 2000 as a base period. To address quality weaknesses, in particular
inappropriate and outdated weights, the commodity basket and the weighting scheme were
revised in mid-2003 under a donor-supported project, and a new monthly index for Dili has
been compiled, with December 2001 as the base period. A further update of CPI weights
based on detailed consumption patterns is not expected before 2007 as the authorities are
focusing on the conduct of a World Bank living standards measurement survey for 2006.

9
Annual data on public sector employment and wages are available through fiscal records. No
official data are compiled regularly on private sector employment and wages, except for
partial data from household surveys conducted jointly by UNDP, ADB, and the World Bank.
Government financial statistics
Official data on central government revenue and expenditure are published semi-annually.
Audited annual financial statements of the executed budget are made available to APD as
soon as they are released, normally three months after the end of the fiscal year. In addition,
monthly data are available on request through the budget, treasury, and revenue services. The
compilation of revenue and expenditure follows the classification of the Manual on
Government Finance Statistics (GFSM 1986) (including expenditure based on both
functional and economic classification). Data on the execution of expenditure carried over
from past fiscal years are not yet compiled and reported regularly. Only partial data are
available on fiscal and quasi-fiscal activities undertaken by bilateral donors outside the
central government budget. Currently, there are four non-financial public enterprises, which
are treated as government agencies and data on their operations are available in the audited
annual financial statements. No data are currently reported for the GFS Yearbook and the
International Financial Statistics.
Monetary accounts
Monetary statistics are compiled by the Banking and Payments Authority (BPA), generally
following the classification recommended by the Fund. However, data are incomplete
because of the absence of official data on public currency holdings, which are difficult to
compile under the current currency regime. The BPA publishes a quarterly bulletin and an
annual report with key monetary aggregates. Detailed monthly monetary data are also
available to Fund staff on request. Comprehensive compilation of data on interest rates (both
deposit and lending rates) and bank lending and investment has begun only recently.
However, the availability of these data is extremely limited because the BPA is concerned
about revealing confidential information on commercial bank operations given the very small
number (four) of banks in the economy.
No monetary data are currently reported to STA for publication in the International
Financial Statistics. Work is ongoing for BPA to start reporting monetary statistics to STA
using the standardized report forms (SRF) on a monthly basis. Such reporting will be used
for the Fund’s operational and publication purposes. To this end, the authorities have already
reported test data for the BPA and the other depository corporations for December 2004, and
are working on deriving monthly for 2005 and 2006.

10
Balance of payments
No official data are available, except on merchandise exports and imports (starting March
2000), which are based on customs reports with a breakdown for major commodity
categories. However, data do not include oil and gas exports. Trade data do not include any
estimate of large unrecorded border trade. Data on oil/gas revenue are currently recorded as
income (for royalties) and transfers (for tax revenue) based on fiscal data. All other major
items in the balance of payments are estimated by Fund staff on the basis of limited
information obtained from various sources, including bilateral donors and banks.
To address institutional weaknesses in the compilation of the balance of payments, the
Ministry of Finance has taken steps to transfer responsibility for the compilation of the
balance of payments to the BPA.

Statement by Arrigo Sadun, Executive Director
for the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste
and Luis Saramago, Advisor to Executive Director
January 29, 2007

We start by thanking staff for their much appreciated work during these consultations, partly
conducted under somewhat challenging conditions. At a time of significant changes in the
social and economic situation of Timor-Leste, the authorities welcomed this opportunity to
discuss their policy options. Moreover, they value the analysis and recommendations of the
staff report and the Selected Issues paper, which will be taken into due consideration as an
important contribution for their policy decisions. They particularly appreciated staff’s care to
represent their views explicitly, extensively and accurately in the staff report.
Key Points
•

The authorities are strongly committed to ensure that political and social stability is
fully reinstated and durably preserved. Significant steps have been taken to promote
national reconciliation and a broad social consensus, while upholding the rule of law,
thus aiming for a smooth path towards the upcoming elections.

•

The authorities remain firmly committed to sound economic policies, under the
National Development strategy, as since the country regained independence in 2002.
Their positive record in this regard has been widely acknowledged – also by the Fund,
as again in the present report – and should be duly emphasized.

•

The development strategy, reiterated by the current government, includes such critical
pillars as the sustainable and transparent management of oil and gas resources; efficient
public spending for development; macroeconomic stability, anchored on US dollar
adoption; and private sector promotion, from an improved business environment.

•

Oil and gas resources are to be the lever for long-term development, through a special
framework for their sound management. Based on a Petroleum Fund and a savings rule,
this framework is acknowledged to follow international best practices and has been
operational since mid-2005 – including throughout the recent instability period.

Recent Developments
Under a new Prime Minister but with a broadly unchanged Cabinet, supported by the same
large single-party majority in Parliament, the current government took office in July last
year. It has pledged to advance national reconciliation, in the aftermath of mid-2006 civil
unrest, and to prepare for the upcoming elections, while reiterating the main economic

2
priorities and guidelines of the previous administration – namely as expressed in the National
Development strategy, and in particular as regards the framework for a sound, transparent
and sustainable management of oil and gas resources.
By restating that commitment, the new government intends to uphold the positive record of
economic policymaking generally acknowledged to the Timorese authorities by the
international community – including the Fund – since independence was restored in 2002. At
the same time, the government is determined to address certain areas on which obstacles such
as capacity problems – a major constraint for Timor-Leste – have prevented faster progress.
Accordingly, it plans to step-up the execution of public investment projects and to improve
conditions for the attraction of private investment, both domestic and foreign.
Economic performance was affected by the mid-2006 incidents, but nevertheless a robust
recovery is now underway, prompted by a rebound of the agriculture sector and mostly
supported by higher, although sustainable, public spending – also compatible with
self-imposed commitments, under the oil and gas savings rule. The recovery is further
assisted by the impact of a re-enhanced UN mission, gradually deployed since August last
year, as well as by the fact that civil unrest was largely restricted to the Díli area, thus tending
to facilitate the normal resumption of economic activities.
According to available data, non-oil GDP is estimated to have contracted by around 6 percent
in 2006, but should rebound by an expected 32 percent in 2007. Prospects for inflation are
also brightening up, as the supply of Díli markets gradually returned to normal after an initial
inflationary disruption, prompted by civil unrest. The continued inflow of sizeable offshore
oil and gas revenues has, in turn, favorably shaped fiscal and external developments: the
2005/06 budget surplus reached 103 percent of non-oil GDP, in a commitment basis, while
the current account surplus is estimated at 116 percent of non-oil GDP in 2006.
Oil and Gas Wealth
After careful preparation, with valued support from the Fund and other external partners, the
framework for a sustainable and transparent management of oil and gas resources essentially
became operational in the second half of 2005. Its cornerstone, the Petroleum Fund Law, was
indeed promulgated in August that year, while other related building-blocks were gradually
added, including the implementation of a Consultive Council and an Investment Advisory
Board, the selection of an independent auditor through international open tender and the
country’s participation in the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative. This high-quality
framework follows international best practices of transparency and accountability, as well as
a conservative financial approach, aimed at preserving resources for future generations, and
also a prudent macroeconomic approach, aimed at minimizing any possible symptoms of the
resource curse.

3
Transfers from the Petroleum Fund, which concentrates all the oil and gas revenues, can only
be made into a specific Treasury account and up to an annual expenditure ceiling deemed
sustainable according to a long-term savings rule: the sum of non-oil domestic revenues and
the estimated permanent income from invested oil and gas revenues. This framework has
proved its robustness throughout the recent period of civil unrest, by which it was not
affected – revenues continued to accumulate in the Petroleum Fund, as supposed. Moreover,
it will likely be able to easily accommodate the expected increase in oil and gas revenues
from new sources, such as the Greater Sunrise field.
Fiscal Policy
The authorities believe that improving public service delivery by means of higher and fasterexecuted public investment is a key requirement to consolidate social stability. On the one
hand, by the creation of conditions for private sector development, notably through
infrastructure enhancement, thus promoting growth and employment. On the other hand, by
implementing pro-poor initiatives that directly allow for a much-needed alleviation of harsh
social conditions. The authorities will, therefore, assign a high priority to efforts aimed at
overcoming implementation constraints, including by way of intra-civil service dissemination
of best practices, in such areas as procurement, and greater reliance on competitive
outsourcing of capital projects to foreign firms.
The priority given to expenditure execution, for such reasons, should not be seen, however,
as an indication of any lesser commitment to fiscal soundness from the authorities’ part.
Their budget for the 2006/07 fiscal year, approved in August, does indeed allow for a
significant rise in spending – to 73 percent of non-oil GDP (on a commitments basis), from
an estimated 34 percent in 2005/06. Nevertheless, total revenues are expected to reach
173 percent of non-oil GDP in the same period and the level of expenditures deemed
sustainable under the oil and gas savings rule is conservatively estimated at 76 percent.
Furthermore, the Sector Investment Programs (SIP) framework was appropriately conceived,
with support from the World Bank and other donors, to preserve the quality of public
investment spending, foster its complementarities with private investment and maximize
returns. As for the budgeted increase in current expenditures, it is largely non-recurrent and
aimed at bridging the transition to a new efficiency-oriented wage structure – against a
background of no pay rises since 2002.
An outstanding track record of fiscal soundness since independence was restored in 2002 –
namely through cautious spending and prudent management of oil and gas revenues – has
allowed the authorities to take credit for a rare absence of public debt. While generally
believing there is no pressing need to change that approach, they nevertheless reiterate that
due consideration may possibly be given to concessional financing options in the future. As
for tax policy, the authorities are very keen on exploring the possibility of simplifying the tax
structure and generally relieving the burden it imposes on the non-oil economy – also from

4
cumbersome red tape, to a large extent determined by capacity constraints. They are
nevertheless aware of the need to proceed with caution and welcome the ongoing FAD
mission that is taking up the issue.
Monetary Policy
The monetary framework adopted by Timor-Leste since the restoration of independence,
with official dollarization as its cornerstone, remains well suited to the country’s needs and
constraints. Indeed, the notion that it provides an effective anchor for price stability seems to
be confirmed by recent trends: inflation has started to decline, thus tending to offset the
mid-2006 upsurge fueled by a post-civil unrest supply shock. Moreover, the framework has
broadly been instrumental in preserving external price-competitiveness, under different and
evolving conditions. Scarce human resources, that would have to be moved from other
priority areas for the independent conduction of monetary policy, are an additional reason to
keep the current framework – even if capacity is increasing with experience, as is particularly
the case of the Banking and Payments Authority (BPA).
Banking Issues
The sizeable increase of non-performing loans since mid-2006 essentially reflects the
disruption caused by civil unrest and should therefore be seen as an exceptional and to some
extent reversible development. Its systemic impact is actually limited by the fact that local
branches of solid foreign banks, with much larger non-Timorese operations, mostly make up
the system. As far as Timor-Leste is concerned, those banks have declared themselves
engaged in long-term strategies that include a gradual expansion of local activities, also in
geographical terms, as the country develops. Moreover, exposure to NPLs is being
significantly reduced by stepped-up provisioning and should also benefit from the credit
registry system under implementation by the BPA. This latter also continues to pursue efforts
aimed at finalizing and taking to Parliament such critical regulatory pieces as the Payments,
the AML and the Central Bank laws.
Other Structural Issues
The authorities acknowledge that significant additional steps need to be taken in order to
improve the environment for private sector activity. They are well aware of the critical
importance assumed by such matters for the country’s medium-term prospects and are
therefore committed to take decisive action in this regard. Besides their plans for the tax
system, currently under consideration and with significant business-enhancement potential,
other steps include several specific measures to streamline legislation, regulation and
administrative procedures relating to domestic and foreign investment. Actually, six months
after taking office and in spite of still challenging security conditions, the new government
can already point to a significant increase of foreign investment – about 30 new projects

5
approved since July 2006, amounting to about USD 180 millions (almost half of non-oil
GDP), against 12 projects in the previous 12 months.
Concluding Remarks
The recent unfortunate events in Timor-Leste have once again highlighted the critical
importance of building capacity and institutions in young, post-conflict countries, while
carefully preserving social cohesion. Those specific events further reinforce the more general
notion that a sustained involvement of the international community is a necessary
requirement for success under such circumstances. Timor-Leste, in particular, will continue
to rely on the valued support of its international partners, among which the Fund has a vital
role to play, building on the significant contribution given for several years in its areas of
expertise. The authorities reiterate their high appreciation of that contribution and thank the
Executive Board, Management and staff for their support, on which they will keep counting
in their challenging endeavors.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
February 28, 2007

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board concludes 2006 Article IV Consultation with the
Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste
On January 29, 2007, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste.1
Background
Timor-Leste had made good progress in establishing the basis for a stable and healthy
economy prior to the civil unrest in 2006, though it remains one of the poorest countries in the
world. Real non-oil GDP growth turned positive in 2004–05 after contracting for two years
following the end of the reconstruction boom of the initial post-conflict years. Macroeconomic
stability was achieved through the early adoption and maintenance of prudent fiscal and
monetary policies. However, progress toward the country’s National Development Plan (NDP)
objectives and Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) was limited. Further, the violence that
erupted in April 2006, although now largely quelled, has introduced new risks to the outlook.
Nonetheless, the onset of large oil-and-gas revenue inflows and prospects for sizable additional
revenue from new fields could still, if properly managed, transform the economy.
The security situation and domestic institutions remain fragile. The unrest, combined with
persistent poverty and high unemployment amid rising expectations highlight the continuing
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
vulnerabilities in the country’s institutional capacity, notwithstanding considerable nation and
capacity building over recent years.
Against this background, increased urgency is placed on meeting the challenge of how best to
use the new oil-and-gas wealth to lift the non-oil economy onto a higher growth path and reduce
poverty. The new government endorsed the pre-existing development strategy, set out in the
NDP and related documents that comprise the Poverty Reduction Strategy. This strategy
focuses on reforms to promote growth, including: a long-term oil-and-gas revenue saving policy
supported by a petroleum fund; well-targeted development spending under the sector
investment programs (SIPs); a monetary and exchange rate regime that preserves
macroeconomic stability; and a private-investment-friendly environment. However, progress on
the strategy has been stronger on some elements than others and non-oil growth still falls short
of that needed to reduce poverty. In the aftermath of the recent unrest, the government plans a
new Compact with donors to reinvigorate implementation of the development strategy.
High world oil-and-gas prices are providing a boost to Timor-Leste’s fortunes by raising current
and potential revenue inflows. Non-oil activity began to recover in 2005 as stable
macroeconomic conditions and improved policies offset a scaling down of donor activity, though
it had not yet risen above the population growth rate. However, the civil unrest in 2006 setback
the growth momentum. As a result, real non-oil GDP growth is estimated to be slightly negative
for the year, despite an end-year boost from public spending and international aid. Driven by
crisis-related supply disruptions, inflation jumped to about 7 percent in the year to June 2006,
although the impact on external price competitiveness has been muted by the recent
depreciation of the exchange rate.
Large oil-and-gas revenue inflows have led to sizeable surpluses in the external current account
and in the fiscal position, notwithstanding sharply increased government spending. Oil-and-gas
revenue was estimated at 128 percent of non-oil GDP in 2005/06, lifting the central government
surplus to 111 percent of non-oil GDP. Central government expenditure of 26 percent of non-oil
GDP remained well below the sustainable spending level determined by the authorities’ saving
policy. The steep increase in budgeted spending for 2006/07, to 73 percent of non-oil-GDP, is
designed in large part to respond to the recent crisis. However, budget execution is likely to
remain constrained by weak capacity, resulting in cash expenditures continuing to fall short of
commitments. On a ‘combined source’ basis, which includes actual government and donor
spending, total expenditure should increase only slightly compared to pre-2005/06 levels as
increased government spending largely offsets lower donor financing.
The authorities have maintained a policy of avoiding domestic or external borrowing, hence
there is no public sector debt. A current account surplus of 93 percent of non-oil GDP (excluding
international assistance) emerged in 2006. Net foreign assets of the Banking and Payments
Authority (BPA), combined with the foreign assets of the petroleum fund, rose to US$957 million
by September 2006, equivalent to almost 7 years of merchandise imports.

3
Loan quality deteriorated further, post-crisis, while private credit contracted. At end-September
2006, nonperforming loans (NPLs) accounted for 30 percent of total bank lending, with banks
now more aggressively provisioning for potential losses. Given still weak enforcement of
creditors’ rights, banks are increasing reluctant to extend new loans and credit to the private
sector fell by 10 percent on a year/year basis.
Reforms needed to spur non-oil private sector activity gained some momentum prior to the
crisis, but significant legal and institutional gaps remain a burden. The investment and export
promotion agency became operational in late 2005 and projects in the fishery, coffee, and
tourism sectors have begun. However, business registration and land development remain
difficult, some key legislation is not yet in place, and the overwhelmed court system has not
been able to address commercial disputes. Poor infrastructure and lack of human capital are
additional difficulties faced in developing the non-oil economy.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for their progress in stabilizing the economy and
establishing a foundation for future growth, while recognizing the need to address the
immediate economic and humanitarian consequences of the recent civil unrest. Looking ahead,
Directors considered that the main challenge is to use the oil-and-gas resources and stable
macroeconomic environment to lift the non-oil economy onto a higher growth path and reduce
poverty.
Directors endorsed the authorities’ development strategy, which focuses on core reforms
needed to promote growth. In this respect, they underscored the need to maintain a monetary
and exchange regime that preserves macroeconomic stability, forceful progress to secure welltargeted and prioritized development spending, and far-reaching reforms to encourage private
activity and investment.
Directors supported a sustainable stepping-up of government investment spending over the
medium term to address Timor-Leste’s considerable development needs. They pointed,
however, to the need for careful planning and monitoring to guard against unproductive
spending and welcomed measures to strengthen budget execution, including the introduction of
small education and community grants, international outsourcing of large infrastructure projects,
improved cash and commitment controls, and procurement decentralization.
Directors commended the authorities for the establishment of the petroleum fund, which along
with the saving rule, will help achieve fiscal sustainability and intergenerational equity. They
welcomed the authorities’ continued policy of transparent reporting of petroleum-related
activities, and the participation in the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative.
Directors supported the current monetary and exchange regime, which provides a credible
nominal anchor for macroeconomic stability. While the current level of the real exchange rate is
not a threat to medium-term competitiveness, Directors called on the authorities to ensure that
fiscal policies—in particularly for wages, subsidies and other recurrent costs—reflect the need

4
to contain price pressures. Directors agreed with the authorities that stronger institutional
capacity and a well-functioning financial market need be in place before considering the
introduction of a national currency.
Directors urged the authorities to limit external borrowing to ensure consistency with the
government’s investment priorities, the sustainable spending framework, and macroeconomic
stability; and to ensure that terms are adequately concessional.
Directors agreed that favorable oil revenue developments provide a welcome opportunity to put
in place wide-ranging tax reforms in the non-oil sector to help spur private economic activity.
They considered that a simplified, streamlined tax regime, with low tax rates and higher
minimum thresholds, would also better fit the limited administrative capacity.
Directors considered that the weakening in banks’ loan portfolios is unlikely to present a
systemic risk, but noted that it may reduce credit availability and slow the economic recovery.
They welcomed plans to further strengthen banking supervision, create a loan registry,
introduce an alternative means of resolving commercial disputes, and finalize banking sector
legislation. Directors cautioned that a state-owned rural-development bank—as is being
considered by the authorities—has to be operated on a strict commercial basis to avoid a
further weakening of the fragile financial system.
Directors stressed that greater efforts are needed to create an environment conducive to more
private investment and growth. They urged the authorities to expedite the passage of critical
legislation, such as the pending land law, while noting that proposed amendments to labor
legislation should encourage greater labor market flexibility.
Directors encouraged the authorities to intensify their efforts to strengthen capacity to compile
and analyze basic macroeconomic data.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The staff report (use the free Adobe Acrobat

Sources: Data provided by the Timor-Leste authorities; and IMF staff estimates.
1/ Non-oil GDP and national accounts data for 2001–03 are based on estimates prepared by a World Bank sponsored
consultant.
2/ CPI for Dili.
3/ Fiscal year basis (July-June); for example, 2001 refers to FY2001/02.
4/ Includes autonomous agencies and fiscal and quasi-fiscal expenditure programs undertaken by bilateral and
multilateral donors outside the central government budget. The revenue decline in FY2005/06 reflects the adoption of a
new savings and petroleum fund policy according to which oil revenue accrues to the petroleum fund and only the
sustainable income from the oil wealth may be transferred to the budget to finance the non-oil fiscal deficit. The overall
balance is also partially funded from donors own funds.
5/ Excludes currency holdings by the public, for which no data are available.
6/ Excludes oil/gas revenue, which are recorded under the income account (royalties) and transfers (tax revenues). Also
excludes re-exports, which primarily relate to repatriation of equipment from UN peacekeeping operations.
