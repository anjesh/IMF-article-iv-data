EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background
Tonga’s economy has become increasingly vulnerable. Fiscal discipline has weakened,
undermining macroeconomic stability and external viability. Some progress has been made
recently in trying to restore fiscal balance, but at the same time efforts to strengthen
governance and promote private sector activity have had negligible success.
Medium-term prospects have deteriorated since last year’s consultation. Following a
lengthy strike, civil servants were granted in September 2005 average wage increases of
about 70 percent payable over the next two years. This decision has the potential to have
significant negative consequences for macroeconomic and external stability.
Key Policy Recommendations
Against this background, the staff recommended that the authorities:
•

Achieve a sustainable fiscal adjustment to restore macroeconomic stability.
Substantial fiscal reforms are needed to offset the cost of the wage settlement,
including downsizing the civil service, stepping up revenue collection efforts,
improving public expenditure management, and advancing public enterprise reform.

•

Stand ready to tighten credit. As higher public sector wages and the severance
package could ease the currently tight liquidity conditions in the banking system, a
further monetary tightening may be called for. Making full use of the flexibility
allowed under the current basket peg arrangement to depreciate the pa’anga may also
be needed to protect reserves.

•

Accelerate the pace of implementation of structural reforms to enhance the role
of the private sector and make the economy more dynamic.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Tonga is a small agriculture-based economy in the South Pacific with a
population of about 100,000 and per capita income of US$1,800. It shares a number of
common characteristics with other Pacific island countries including remoteness, openness,
limited production diversification, and vulnerability to natural disasters. The population has
remained broadly constant over the past decades, because of large-scale emigration mainly to
Australia, New Zealand, and the United States. As a result, Tonga is one of the highest
recipients of net remittances among developing countries, which amounted to more than
40 percent of GDP in 2004/05 (year ending June).
2.
Poor macroeconomic policies and deteriorating governance have increased the
country’s vulnerability. Tonga’s economic performance has been disappointing with
respect to its comparators (Figure 1). Limited progress has been made over the past decades
in broadening the narrow production and export base, reducing the dependence on external
transfers, and strengthening a tax system heavily reliant on trade taxation. Furthermore,
budget discipline has weakened, undermining macroeconomic stability and external viability.
Progress in addressing the policy challenges identified by the Fund is mixed. The fiscal
position improved in 2003/04 and 2004/05, but efforts to strengthen governance and promote
private sector activity had negligible success.
3.
Economic prospects have deteriorated since last year’s consultation, while
political reform has gained momentum. Following a lengthy strike, civil servants were
granted in September 2005 average wage increases of about 70 percent (to be implemented
over two years), a political decision with significant consequences for macroeconomic and
external stability (Box 1). Following the settlement, the authorities stated their intention to
respond to these circumstances by pushing ahead with key reforms to safeguard
macroeconomic stability, improve governance, and enhance the role of the private sector.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister resigned in February 2006. The Minister of Labor was
appointed Acting Prime Minister and was confirmed at the end of March, a move perceived
by observers as positive for political reforms.1 While the former Prime Minister is the King’s
youngest son, the new Prime Minister is a commoner and one of the few elected officials.

Tonga is a constitutional monarchy in which substantial powers are assigned to the King and the
nobility. Since the early 1990s, there has been a vocal movement pushing for a more democratic
system whereby all 30 members of the Legislative Assembly would be elected, and the Cabinet and
Prime Minister selected by the King from this elected body.

-5-

II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
4.
Economic activity has slowed and inflation has eased. According to preliminary
information, the economy is expected to expand at a slower pace in 2005/06 than the
2½ percent gain in 2004/05, reflecting a poor squash season and slower growth in
construction (Figure 3). Inflation declined to 9½ percent in 2004/05 compared to about
11½ percent in the previous year, and has since eased further to 5¼ percent during the year to
February 2006, reflecting slower domestic food and import price increases.
5.
Steps are being taken to contain the fiscal impact of the first phase of the wage
settlement, although severance payments could significantly widen the fiscal deficit. An
overall fiscal surplus of about 2½ percent of GDP was achieved in 2004/05, in marked
contrast to the deficit of 2¼ percent of GDP envisaged in the budget, owing to lower-thanbudgeted wages and capital spending, and stronger tax collection. In 2005/06, the original
budget targeted a deficit of 1.8 percent of GDP, mostly covered by external concessional
financing. However, available information for the first eight months of 2005/06 indicates that
revenue performance was weaker than expected, mainly because of lower nontax and excise
collection. Moreover, the unanticipated cost of the first phase of the wage increase is
estimated to be about 3 percent of GDP. Savings have been carried out (mostly capital
expenditure cuts and a hiring freeze) that are expected to offset this cost as well as the likely
revenue shortfall. The authorities are also working on downsizing the civil service by the end
of the fiscal year and the related severance payments could amount to about 5 percent
of GDP.2
6.
Credit growth has picked up. Liquidity in the banking system increased following
the improvement in the government’s net credit position with the domestic banking system
and the repayment of loans by a major private utility company in 2003/04.3 These funds were
used to finance a 21 percent expansion in net domestic credit in 2004/05, mainly driven by a
rapid rise in housing and personal loans. To rein in this rapid credit expansion, the National
Reserve Bank of Tonga (NRBT) reintroduced credit ceilings in January 2006.4 However,
with liquidity conditions tightening in the banking system, pressure on the central bank to
ease its monetary stance mounted, and reserve requirements were reduced in March (from
2

The severance package for voluntary redundant civil servants being considered at the time of the
mission amounted to a minimum of three months of salary with an additional two weeks for every
year of service, up to a maximum of twelve months.
3

A telecommunication and power group owned by a member of the royal family reportedly borrowed
from abroad the equivalent of about 8½ percent of GDP to refinance outstanding obligations to the
domestic banking system.

open market-type operations.6
7.
A substantial increase in imports and lower capital inflows led to a decline in
Tonga’s foreign exchange reserves. The trade balance deteriorated in 2004/05, as imports

The pa’anga has remained stable relative to its basket. The value of the pa’anga is
determined based on a weighted basket of currencies, including the U.S., Australian, and
New Zealand dollars and the Japanese yen. The NRBT is allowed to adjust its value relative
to the basket by up to 5 percent per month and aims at maintaining the level of foreign
reserves above three months of imports. With foreign reserves remaining above this level, the
NRBT has kept the Tongan currency broadly stable in nominal effective terms since 2004

The liquidity impact of this reduction is estimated to be about 5.3 million pa’anga (2.5 percent of
total deposits).

The NRBT had introduced open-market type operations in 1993, but had to discontinue them in
2001 because of its weak financial position. Since then, steps have been taken to strengthen the
bank’s balance sheet, such as allowing it to retain its net profits. For details, see Selected Issues Paper
for the 2005 Article Consultation.

Tonga has lost its competitiveness relative
to other countries in the region. Discussions with the private sector also indicated that the
major obstacle for exports was not the current level of the exchange rate—given the
relatively high import content of exports and the niche market for Tongan squash in Japan—
but rather the country’s lack of reliable infrastructure and unfavorable business climate.

III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Outlook and Risks
9.
Short-term economic prospects are highly uncertain and depend critically on the
authorities achieving a proposed substantial downsizing of the civil service. The swing in
the fiscal position from surplus to deficit is expected to contribute to a widening of the
current account deficit in 2005/06. Only if an expected government asset sale to foreign
investors is completed will there be sufficient financing to maintain the reserve position,
keep the exchange rate broadly stable, and prevent major inflationary pressures from
emerging. In 2006/07, economic activity would be adversely affected by the proposed civil
service downsizing. The payment of the severance package would cushion this effect
somewhat, although it could also put pressure on reserves and the exchange rate.
10.
In the medium term, a sustained sound fiscal policy and structural reforms are
needed to improve economic performance. Following the wage settlement, the authorities
should follow through on their stated commitment to push ahead with key reforms to
safeguard macroeconomic stability, improve governance, and enhance the role of the private
sector. While restoring fiscal balance will take a short-term toll on growth, achieving a more
stable macroeconomic environment and promoting private sector activity would create a
climate conducive to higher investment. Under these conditions, real GDP growth could
reach about 3 percent over the medium term (Table 5).
11.
Should fiscal adjustment fail and reforms stall, the outlook would be much worse.
If the wage bill were to remain unchecked, fiscal deficits of the order of 4½ percent of GDP
could materialize. With the civil service union trying to preserve the real income of its
membership through additional wage increases, a wage-price spiral would be triggered, as the
budget would have to rely on domestic financing (Table 6). The authorities also would not
have the required fiscal resources to increase public capital expenditure, and unstable

-8-

macroeconomic conditions would not provide a business climate conducive to fostering
private investment. In these circumstances, the economy would be expected to stagnate, with
GDP growth slowing over the medium term to about 1 percent. Should such a scenario
materialize, Tonga would be at a high risk of debt distress, its NPV of public external debt-toexports ratio breaching the indicative threshold (Annex I).7 The country’s debt profile would
be particularly vulnerable to a sharp fall in net remittances or in the value of the currency.
B. Fiscal Policy
12.
The authorities are committed to fiscal adjustment. Staff welcomed the
authorities’ prompt corrective measures in 2005/06 to contain the costs of the first phase of
the wage settlement. However, relying mainly on capital expenditure cuts and a freeze in
hiring provides only a limited and temporary solution to the problem. The authorities agreed
that more sustainable savings needed to be identified. To achieve such savings and contain
the costs of the second phase of the settlement, the authorities are working on reducing the
civil service by a quarter by the end of 2005/06. This result is to be achieved by targeted and
voluntary redundancies, with severances to be financed by government asset sales and donor
assistance.8 The civil service union does not oppose this plan, as long as the redundancies

remain voluntary. If the downsizing target is met by the end of the current fiscal year, the
severance payments would widen the overall deficit for 2005/06 by about 5 percent of GDP
to 6¾ percent, with the expectation that the deficit would be mostly financed externally. For

-9-

next fiscal year, the combination of a smaller civil service and continued expenditure
restraint could limit the fiscal deficit to 1.5 percent of GDP.
13.
There are serious downside risks to this fiscal outlook and effective alternative
measures need to be identified. Given Tonga’s relatively large civil service, staff supported
the authorities’ objective, but noted that the scale of the envisaged downsizing of the public
service was unprecedented (Figure 2). Preliminary reactions of civil servants to the proposed
severance package suggest that voluntary redundancies could fall well short of expectations
or that the package would need to be significantly increased to achieve the desired objective.
To increase the attractiveness of the severance package, the authorities noted that they
intended to provide those leaving with business incentives and training, which would not
only assist workers in finding alternative positions, but also strengthen the private sector.
Staff also expressed concern that there would be insufficient financing for redundancy
payments if the anticipated government asset sale were not to materialize. The authorities
responded that discussions with foreign investors for the asset sale were well advanced and
donors had been approached for possible assistance. Finally, with Tonga’s expected
accession to the WTO, tariff revenue will significantly decline and there is a risk of a
revenue shortfall, if needed corrective tax policy and administration measures are not taken
on time (Box 2). Should these risks materialize, the overall fiscal deficit for 2006/07 could
amount to 4½ percent of GDP. Cutting capital and related current spending further will not
be possible without disrupting the delivery of key social services and improvements in public
infrastructure.
14.
The authorities recognized that their downsizing plan was ambitious, but did not
see any alternative. The authorities noted that they had initially considered the option of
renegotiating the wage settlement, but were concerned about the prospect of another civil
service strike. The idea of forced redundancies had met with similar concerns. The
authorities therefore decided to put these options aside to avoid further social unrest and
focus instead on a downsizing of the civil service based on voluntary redundancies.
Discussions that staff had with the civil service union confirmed the union’s unwillingness to
revisit the wage settlement despite its macroeconomic implications.
15.
The authorities stated their commitment to step up fiscal reforms to reduce
downside risks. Progress has been made in improving tax administration in the run-up to the
introduction of the consumption tax in April 2005, such as the establishment of a large
taxpayer unit and the initiation of computerization. Administrative capacity has also
improved at customs, as key positions were filled by external experts. The authorities agreed,
however, that strengthening the legal framework and tax enforcement, in particular for excise
taxes, and building a taxpayer culture more generally were critical to offset the revenue
decline in tariff revenue expected from Tonga’s accession to the WTO. At the same time,
further improvements in public expenditure management are required to raise the
effectiveness of scarce public resources. Lack of funding and training is still holding up the
extension of the accounting system to all ministries (only 7 ministries out of 30 are
effectively connected to the system), but the authorities reiterated that achieving timely and

- 10 -

reliable financial reporting remained a priority. The authorities and staff also agreed that the
introduction of a medium-term budget framework would help signal their commitment to a
sustainable fiscal policy and foster donor support.
C. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
16.
The authorities and staff agreed that a further tightening of monetary policy
may be needed in response to the wage settlement. Staff welcomed the NRBT’s decision
to reintroduce credit ceilings to rein in the unsustainable credit growth experienced in the
first half of 2005/06, but questioned the easing in March with the reduction in reserve
requirements. In the period ahead, higher public sector wages and the payment of the
severance package are likely to increase liquidity in the banking system and the NRBT
agreed that it should stand ready to tighten its monetary stance.
17.
It is unclear that the NRBT will be in a position to pursue the required tight
monetary policy. Staff welcomed the introduction of open market-type instruments that
should improve the central bank’s control over monetary developments. However, at this
stage, these new instruments remain untested. Although credit ceilings are rudimentary, the
NRBT may need to continue to rely on them in the short run to contain lending growth. Staff
also expressed concern about the ability of the central bank to maintain a tight monetary
stance, given the bank’s response to the recent pressure to reduce reserve requirements. The
economic team fully shared this concern and were seeking to limit possible future
interference by making the central bank more independent.
18.
To strengthen the NRBT, early enactment of the Amendments to the NRBT Act
is critical. Amendments to the NRBT Act, including provisions for doubling the NRBT’s
capital base and clarifying the profit transfer rule, failed to be approved by the Legislative
Assembly. The authorities noted that they intended to continue to seek greater independence
for the central bank and re-submit the amendments in the coming months with greater
communication efforts to foster appropriate support. Staff supported this plan and
recommended that such amendments should also include a strict limit on direct central bank
credit to the government and a clarification of the objectives of the NRBT. The authorities
agreed to examine these issues while revising the amendments.
19.
The authorities agreed that the exchange rate would have to be managed
flexibly. Given Tonga’s vulnerability to natural disasters, terms of trade shocks, its lack of
effective monetary policy, weak fiscal discipline, and low level of reserves, the current
exchange rate arrangement was judged to have provided appropriate flexibility, although at
the cost of higher inflation.9 With the wage settlement and the severance package likely to
feed into higher imports, it may not be possible to tighten monetary policy enough to prevent

The benefits of Tonga’s exchange rate arrangement have been analyzed in detail in the Selected
Issues Paper for the 2002 Article IV Consultation.

- 11 -

downward pressure on the exchange rate from materializing. In this case, the flexibility
provided by the current exchange rate arrangement should be fully utilized and the value of
the pa’anga allowed to depreciate relative to the currency basket.
D. Structural Reforms and Other Issues
20.
The authorities and staff agreed that a more dynamic private sector offering
alternative employment opportunities would facilitate the downsizing of the public
sector. As in other Pacific island countries, private sector activity has been constrained by the
economy’s remoteness from its main export markets and a limited pool of entrepreneurs.10

Nevertheless, there are a number of additional policy-related impediments, which if removed
could contribute to developing a competitive private sector. Available indicators suggest that
Tonga compares favorably with the region in terms of business regulation, but poorly in terms
of governance. The authorities agreed that the business and investment climate needed to be
improved and established a public-private sector task force, with the assistance of the World
Bank, to identify and reduce critical impediments to private sector development. In addition,
Tonga will repeal the Industrial Development Incentive Act (considered distortionary and
ineffective), and reduce restrictions on business licensing and foreign direct investment in the
run-up to its WTO accession. While welcoming these developments, staff encouraged the
authorities to also make progress in amending the land regime to extend the duration of leases
and eliminate the uncertainty stemming from frequent revisions to rents, strengthen regulatory
agencies, and further corporatize and privatize public enterprises in order to better delineate

More needs to be done to further public enterprise reform and reduce
contingent liabilities. Substantial capacity constraints and political sensitivities continue to
limit the pace of progress, with the authorities coming under political pressure to repurchase
the power company.11 Staff expressed concern about the fiscal implications of this lack of
progress and strongly supported the authorities’ efforts to draw on external expertise to
untangle the financial and legal issues currently delaying the privatization or liquidation of
public enterprises. The authorities added that they had no intention to renationalize the power
sector and that potential private foreign investors were being sought for the power company.
22.
Further improvements in the effectiveness of NRBT’s bank supervision is
needed. Although indicators of banking soundness have improved in 2004/05, the authorities
agreed to continue to monitor credit developments closely to avoid a deterioration in asset
quality in light of the recent rapid lending growth.12 The amended Financial Institution Act
became effective in April 2006, making the licensing and supervision of financial institutions
consistent with Basle Core Principles, but the related prudential regulations and standards are
still being finalized. Progress was also made in the area of AML/CFT, with the introduction
of a database on the reporting of suspicious transactions and ongoing work to amend AML
related legislation in line with Fund recommendations.

11

A large telecommunication and power group owned by a member of the royal family has managed
the power sector since 1998. Popular discontent following power tariff increases and reports of
corporate mismanagement has recently led to calls on the authorities to repurchase these assets.

Tonga’s banking system is comprised of three foreign-owned commercial banks (Westpac Bank of
Tonga, ANZ, and MBf) and one development bank (Tonga Development Bank).

Shortcomings in statistics continue to affect policy analysis and formulation in
Tonga. The authorities agreed that there was an urgent need to improve the reliability,
coverage, and timeliness of statistics, and noted that they intend to devote more resources to
address these issues. On the national accounts, staff acknowledged the capacity constraints
faced by Tonga’s Statistics Department in improving the data, and welcomed the revisions
that have been made in response to PFTAC’s recommendations. On the balance of payments,
the authorities continue to investigate the existing large errors and omissions. They also
agreed that official capital flows needed to be reconciled on a regular basis with the external
debt data to ensure consistency. On fiscal data, difficulties remained when reconciling aboveand below-the-line items in the GFS format, but planned improvements in the financial
management system should help to strengthen financial reporting in the future.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
24.
Economic prospects have deteriorated since last year’s consultation. The
substantial civil service wage increase decided in September 2005 represents a marked
departure from the more cautious fiscal policy that had been adopted over the past two years.
The country’s economic prospects are highly uncertain and will depend on the authorities’
ability to adjust for the wage settlement. It is therefore urgent that the authorities follow
through on their stated intentions to push ahead with key reforms to safeguard
macroeconomic stability, improve governance, and enhance the role of the private sector.
25.
Prompt and effective corrective measures to contain the fiscal implications of the
wage settlement are needed. The authorities have acted to offset the initial impact of the
wage settlement, but going forward more sustainable fiscal measures are required. In this
regard, the authorities have formulated an ambitious plan to bring the civil service down to a
more appropriate size, based on targeted and voluntary redundancies, and financed externally.
At this stage, however, it is unclear whether it will be successful. Should voluntary
redundancies fall short of expectations, alternative measures including potentially more
difficult ones will need to be considered to maintain macroeconomic stability.
26.
Moreover, there are other serious downside risks to the fiscal outlook. Building a
taxpayer culture, and strengthening the legal framework and capacity for tax enforcement, in
particular for excise taxes, will be critical to offset the revenue decline in trade taxes expected
from Tonga’s accession to the WTO. The accounting system also needs to be fully
operationalized and rolled out to all ministries, and a medium-term budget framework
introduced to signal the authorities’ commitment to a sustainable fiscal policy and foster donor
support. Political pressure for the government to get back into the power sector should be
resisted, and the pace of public enterprise reform accelerated.
27.
Further monetary tightening in response to the wage settlement may be needed,
and the full flexibility of the exchange rate system will have to be utilized. The NRBT’s
ability to deliver such policies is, however, uncertain. The new open market-type instruments
that the central bank started to auction in March are untested, and it may need to rely for
some time longer on its more rudimentary credit ceilings. Moreover, to reduce political

- 14 -

pressure, greater central bank independence is required. Early enactment of the Amendments
to the NRBT Act is critical in this regard.
28.
A larger and more dynamic private sector offering alternative employment
opportunities would facilitate the downsizing of the public sector. The business and
investment climate needs to be improved, including by repealing the IDI Act and clarifying
the boundaries between the private and public sectors so as to level the playing field.
Stronger and more independent regulatory agencies would also be beneficial. In addition, the
land regime should be amended to extend the duration of leases and eliminate the uncertainty
stemming from frequent revisions to rents.
29.
While data provision for surveillance purposes is adequate overall, there is a
need to improve the reliability, coverage, and timeliness of statistics. In particular, the
quality of the national, external, and public accounts should be improved to assist the
authorities in conducting policies and implementing reforms.
30.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Tonga takes place on the
standard 12-month cycle.

Box 1. Tonga: The September 2005 Civil Service Wage Settlement
Substantial public wage increases are not uncommon in Tonga. The ability to recruit and retain qualified
staff has been an ongoing concern, leading to instances of substantial adjustment in public wages and a
combination of subsequent restraint and limits on hiring to priority positions to bring the wage bill back in
line. The last major review of public compensation in 1989/90 resulted in a 50 percent increase in wages. A
Public Service Commission, established in 2003 to design a more orderly mechanism for public sector
employment and wages, proposed to introduce a new pay scale in 2005/06, better aligning compensation
and skills. However, civil servants reacted negatively to its implementation and went on strike in July 2005.
The strike rapidly took on a political dimension. The strike was joined by various segments of the society
expressing their dissatisfaction with the country’s economic management and political regime, and the
leaders of the movement started to call for a greater democratization of the Tongan political system in
addition to substantial wage increases for all civil servants. After six weeks of negotiation, the government
agreed to the following agreement:
•

effective from July 2005, salaries of civil servants are increased by 60–80 percent, depending on
their grade;

•

the salary increase for 2005/06 will be paid in two phases: 60 percent of the increase in 2005/06 and
40 percent in 2006/07; and

•

except for the ongoing tax reform, taxes cannot be increased to finance the wage settlement.

The fiscal and economic implications of the wage settlement are substantial. An increase in the wage
bill of 1.6 percent of GDP had been included in the 2005/06 budget to finance the proposed pay scale, but
additional corrective measures needed to be identified to cover the cost of the first phase of the settlement
(estimated at 4 ½ percent of GDP). To enhance the sustainability of their fiscal adjustment and contain the
cost of the second phase of the wage settlement, the authorities plan to downsize the relatively large civil
service. 1,000 positions (25 percent of total civil servants) would be cut by the end of 2005/06. While
substantial public sector downsizings are not uncommon in the Pacific, they have usually been spread over
several years. In addition, even in these cases, the experience has been that insufficient attention had been
paid to the effectiveness of public service delivery and the ability of the private sector to absorb redundant
workers.1

Box 2. Tonga’s Accession to the World Trade Organization
Tonga’s impending accession to the WTO represents a significant step in its efforts to
liberalize trade. After ten years of negotiation, the terms of Tonga’s membership, including
the schedule of its commitments, were approved by the WTO in December 2005. If Tonga
ratifies these terms by end-July, it will become the 150th member and the fourth Pacific islands
country to join the institution (after Fiji, Papua New Guinea, and the Solomon Islands). In
Tonga, accession to the WTO is seen as a way to enhance trade security, improve market
access, and foster competitiveness. Accession to the WTO would also complement Tonga’s
regional efforts towards greater economic integration. Tonga has signed the Pacific Island

Tonga has been carrying out tax reforms to minimize the revenue implications of its
accession. As part of the WTO accession, Tonga is committed to reduce tariffs to a maximum
of 20 percent (15 percent for some goods) by the beginning of 2007, and eliminate the tax and
tariff exemptions allowed under the Industrial Development Incentive Act. To prepare for this
move, a comprehensive tax reform was approved in 2002 to shift Tonga’s tax system away
from trade taxes and towards greater reliance on domestic taxation, coupled with efforts to
strengthen overall tax compliance. A 15 percent consumption tax was introduced in
April 2005 to replace the domestic sales tax and the ports and services tax. Most of the
remaining tariff rates range now

ANNEX I

TONGA: JOINT FUND / WORLD BANK DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
This annex provides an updated debt sustainability analysis (DSA) for Tonga.13 The
DSA was prepared jointly with the World Bank in accordance with the Debt Sustainability
Framework for low-income countries approved by the Executive Boards of the IMF and
IDA.14
Updated debt indicators imply that Tonga has moved into the category of low-income
countries with a high risk of debt distress, representing a worsening of the situation
since the last DSA. The scenario indicates a breach of the threshold for NPV of debt-toexports from 2004/05 through 2016/17, which is exacerbated by stress tests. The remaining
debt stock and debt service ratios are below indicative thresholds. Alternative scenarios and
stress tests demonstrate that debt sustainability is critically dependent upon implementation
of planned fiscal and private sector reforms.
A. Background
Tonga was found in March 2006 to have debt ratios below the HIPC Initiative
thresholds. In line with the HIPC Initiative guidelines and the Boards’ guidance, Tonga was
not included in the list of countries potentially eligible for debt relief under the HIPC
initiative.15
External public debt as a percent of GDP has declined over the past few years. External
public debt fell in line with the decline in loan disbursements following the completion of

13

The last comprehensive DSA for Tonga was prepared in the context of the 2005 Article IV
Consultation.
14

This is an abridged version of the joint DSA carried out by the Fund and the World Bank. The debt
data underlying this exercise were updated jointly by the IMF and the World Bank using information
provided by the Tongan authorities. The DSA was in part based on data generated by the joint
Fund/Bank board paper “Review of Financing of the Fund’s Concessional Assistance and Debt Relief
to Low-Income Member Countries” (March 2006). This data was fully reconciled up to endDecember 2004, as per the requirements of the ring-fencing exercise. For the current DSA, the debt
service projections for the end-December 2004 data were adapted to the Tonga fiscal year, which
adheres to the DSA cut-off date (i.e. end-June 2005). The data was also updated for disbursements
that took place between January and June 2005.
15

See the joint Fund/Bank board paper “Review of Financing of the Fund’s Concessional Assistance
and Debt Relief to Low-Income Member Countries” (March 2006), page 7. The HIPC Initiative
thresholds are 150 percent for the ratio of the net present value of debt (NPV) to exports of goods and
services and 250 percent for the ratio of NPV to fiscal revenue. To qualify under the second criterion
a country must have ratios of exports of goods and services to GDP and fiscal revenue to GDP above
30 percent and 15 percent, respectively.

latest date for which comprehensive data is
available, the stock of external public debt amounted to $76.4 million, with a net present
value of $50.1 million. Tonga’s NPV of debt-to-exports ratio is estimated at 128.1 percent
(the relevant policy-based indicative threshold is 100 percent).16 The ratio is expected to fall
to 102.7 percent by 2015/16 and to 66.1 percent by 2025/26. Other relevant indicators,
including the NPV of debt-to-GDP, remain below the thresholds throughout the projection
period.
B. Medium-term Macroeconomic Framework
The medium-term framework assumes that the planned fiscal adjustment fails and
other reforms stall. A continued fiscal deficit of between 4 and 4½ percent is projected in
this case, with limited improvement in revenue administration and a continued high wage
bill. As external assistance is expected to decline without reform efforts, the budget would
have to rely on domestic financing, placing continued pressure on inflation, the current
account and foreign reserves. In this environment, the authorities will not be able to increase
public capital expenditure and improve the business climate needed to foster private
investment. In addition, tight monetary conditions will be needed to contain credit growth,
further hampering private sector activity. With limited public and private investment, GDP
growth will remain at about 1 percent, below the historical average. A near-term decline in
the real exchange rate should help to improve the current account and turn it into a small
surplus by 2010/11.

16

The World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) index summarizes the
quality of a country’s policies. Based on this index, a country is categorized as a strong, medium or
poor performer. The appropriate debt thresholds vary by category. In the latest CPIA (2005), Tonga is
classified as a poor performer, the thresholds for which are: NPV of debt-to-exports (100 percent),
GDP (30 percent) and revenues (200 percent); and debt service in percent of exports (15 percent) and
revenues (25 percent).

C. External Debt Sustainability Analysis
In the baseline scenario, the NPV of debt-to-exports breaches the policy-dependent
threshold by a large margin and is sustained over the medium term. (Table 1). The NPV
of external public debt to exports is expected to remain above indicative thresholds until
2016/17, but continue its decline to 66 percent by 2025/26 reflecting the limited availability
of external finance without reform efforts. While this ratio is above the indicative threshold
of 100 percent for much of the projection period, the high level of remittances has a
countervailing effect.17 Tonga’s external public debt as a percent of GDP is projected to
increase slightly over the next few years and then decline steadily. The remaining indicators
are projected to remain below indicative threshold levels.
Stress tests underscore that Tonga’s debt profile is vulnerable to adverse shocks. (Table
2, Figure 1). One of the largest risks identified among the set of stress tests is a sharp fall in
net transfers (historical average minus one standard deviation) in 2006/07–07/08. This
scenario could arise if there is a sharp fall in net private remittances due to a recession in
those countries where Tongans living abroad reside. If this were to occur, the debt stock
indicators would rise well above threshold levels, although the debt service ratio would
remain under the policy-dependent threshold. In contrast, a return of key variables to
historical averages, which includes higher GDP growth than in the baseline scenario, would
imply an improvement in all ratios.
D. Fiscal Debt Sustainability Analysis
The sizeable level of domestic debt poses an additional risk to fiscal sustainability
(Table 3). At end-2004/05, domestic debt was 15.4 percent of GDP, bringing total public
debt to 50.8 percent of GDP. Domestic public debt and, as a result, total public debt are
projected to increase over the next five years due to the domestic financing of the fiscal
deficit, reaching a high of 62.6 percent in 2010/11. The gradual build up of domestic public
debt is projected to continue thereafter.
Alternative scenarios and stress tests highlight the vulnerability of the total public debt
position (Table 4, Figure 2). A one-time 30 percent real depreciation or a 10 percent of GDP
17

In 2004/05, net remittances were over two times the value of exports.

- 32 -

ANNEX I

increase in other debt-creating flows in 2006/07 would cause quite a sharp increase in the
debt stock and debt service indicators. These scenarios could unfold if the National Reserve
Bank of Tonga needs to devalue the currency, or if the government requires additional
financing due to a further deterioration of revenue administration or expenditure
management. On the other hand, a return of real GDP growth and primary fiscal balance to
historical averages would see a marked improvement in all ratios.
E. Staff Assessment
Based on the LIC-DSA, staffs conclude that Tonga’s external debt dynamics are subject
to a high risk of debt distress. The NPV of debt-to-exports remains above the threshold by
a large margin over much of the projection period in the baseline scenario, and is exacerbated
by stress tests. In addition, the threshold for an additional debt stock indicator (i.e. NPV of
debt-to-GDP) is breached by the alternative scenarios and stress tests. The remaining debt
stock and debt service indicators remain below the indicative thresholds. While stress tests
highlight some vulnerabilities to debt sustainability, including the risks around a sharp fall in
net transfers or the value of the currency, the alternative scenarios, in contrast, show that a
return of GDP growth and the primary balance to historical averages would strongly enhance
debt sustainability. This further emphasizes the critical importance of fully implementing the
planned fiscal and private sector reforms.

4/ Assumes that NPV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments devided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.

Source: Staff projections and simulations.
1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline, while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

ANNEX III

TONGA: RELATIONS WITH THE PACIFIC FINANCIAL TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CENTRE18
(As of April 2006)
Assistance to Tonga since 2002 included 31 advisory missions, mostly on tax and customs
administration and banking. During 2002–05, Tonga has sent 55 officials to the Centre’s
regional seminars, workshops and training courses, and 6 attachments were organized.
Public Financial Management
Since 2003, PFTAC’s missions have focused on complementing the considerable assistance
provided by other TA agencies, including through the introduction of a mid-year economic
review and fiscal update, reconciliation of monetary and fiscal data, and changes in budget
documentation. For the 2003–04 and 2004–05 budgets, assistance was provided in presenting
the final aggregate budget figures on a GFSM2001 basis. In addition, in 2004 PFTAC
arranged for a short-term secondment of two officials to the Samoan Ministry of Finance and
one official to participate on a delegation of Pacific Island officials to the Australian
Commonwealth Ministry of Finance. In late 2005, the PFTAC expert worked with the
Ministry of Finance to assess the budgetary implications of the civil service wage increase.
Tax Administration and Policy
A tax reform package, including a new consumption tax, was designed by PFTAC in 2002.
Follow-up missions in 2003 and 2004 were designed to assist in the preparations for the
implementation of that package. At the end of January 2005, the Minister of Finance
announced a substantially altered plan to implement a consumption tax and some other
changes on April 1, 2005. PFTAC was not requested to assist in its implementation. The
Centre will, however, provide assistance in the redrafting of the Customs legislation. In late
2005, NZAID offered additional financing to PFTAC to fund three short visits to Tonga to
assist with revenue forecasting; the first of these missions took place in February 2006.
Banking Sector Regulation and Supervision
An assessment to determine compliance with the Basel Core Principles for Effective Banking
Supervision (BCP) was conducted in 2002. It identified some shortcomings in Tonga’s legal
framework and resulted in a review of the Financial Institutions Act (FIA). The enhanced
FIA was enacted in late 2004. A TA mission provided assistance with drafting regulations
and guidelines, and establishing procedures for their implementation in April 2005. Further
assistance in supervision was provided in late 2005 and in February 2006, as PFTAC has
participated more regularly in on-site examinations. Amendments to the NRBT Act, which
will strengthen the central bank’s enforcement capacity, are still awaiting Parliament’s
enactment. PFTAC also arranged, through funding provided in late 2005 by NZAID, for the

Economic and Financial Statistics
In 2002, two reviews were undertaken in accordance with the GDDS and the Data Quality
Assessment Framework; one on BOP statistics and the other on the wider statistical system.
Subsequent missions in 2004 finalized GDDS metadata, provided training in BOP concepts
and practices, developed a new BOP business survey, and reviewed national accounts data.
In September 2005, a partial update of the 2002 statistical system review was done, focusing
on outputs of the Statistics Division of the Ministry of Finance. Further assistance was
provided to peer review draft GDP and BOP estimates prior to publication.

TONGA: RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP19
(As of April 2006)
Since becoming a World Bank Group member in 1985, Tonga has received a total of five
IDA credits totaling US$23.6 million. The key components of the Bank’s current program
are:
•

Health: The Health Sector Support Project, with an IDA credit of US$11.6 million
approved in mid-2003, was developed in cooperation with AusAID. The project is helping
the government to improve the quality of health care on the most heavily populated island of
Tongatapu.

•

Natural Hazard Management: The Cyclone Emergency Recovery and Management
Project, with an IDA credit of US$6.7 million approved in 2002, is assisting Tonga in
replacing and strengthening the resilience of social infrastructure and helping upgrade
Tonga’s emergency and risk management capacity to ensure it can cope better with future
disasters and the risk posed by climate change.

•

Financial Management and Procurement: An IDF grant of US$200,000 was approved in
December 2003 and is supporting public procurement reforms and procurement capacity
building through the provision of technical assistance.

•

Private Sector Development: The Bank has provided analytical and technical assistance in
cooperation with FIAS to support the government’s initiative to create a joint public-private
tasks force as an effort to tackle regulatory impediments to private sector development. In
collaboration with the Pacific Enterprise Development Facility (PEDF), the IFC has
supported 18 projects in Tonga, 13 of them raising finance locally to start or expand local
businesses in fisheries, agriculture, insurance, professional services, laboratory,
manufacturing and port services. In 2004, IFC completed a piece of advisory work for the
government on Royal Tongan Airlines.

•

Education System: The Tongan Education Support Project with an IDA credit of
US$0.95 million and an NZAID trust fund of US$3.8 million (managed by the Bank) was
approved in June 2005. Together with NZAID, the Bank is helping to structure a sectorwide approach that would pool donor and government funding to comprehensively target
education priorities, particularly: school curriculum development, non-salary resource
allocations, teaching and learning materials, language policy, student assessment, and the
supply and quality of teachers.

•

Transport Sector Reform: The Bank has completed a Transport Sector Review Study that
provides analytical assistance to support the government’s commitment to improve the
structure and efficiency of the sector, including assessing options for sustainable financing.
An ongoing study of opportunities for public-private partnership in the airport sector is

expected to be completed by end-April 2006. The Bank stands ready to assist the newly
formed Ministry of Transport in meeting its sectoral needs as defined in the Transport
Sector Review Study. There is a joint Pacific Infrastructure Report with the ADB, AusAid,
and NZAid to discuss the sector situation, and this is expected to be completed by end-2006.

ANNEX V

TONGA: RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK20
(As of May 2005)
The Asian Development Bank (ADB)’s country program and strategy update for 2005-2006
focuses on (i) continuing assistance to the government’s reform program to enhance sound
economic and public sector management; (ii) addressing the emerging deterioration in some
social indicators through targeted interventions that promote inclusive social development; and
(iii) improving the enabling environment for private sector development.
The key projects under consideration aim at (i) providing assistance to develop a new strategic
development plan, linked to a multi-year fiscal framework and an annual resource allocation
process; (ii) providing continued support for public enterprise reforms, especially the
privatization of selected public enterprises; (iii) addressing youth unemployment and associated
social problems; (iv) improving basic infrastructure for drainage and sanitation in selected areas
in the capital; and (v) supporting agriculture sector development through an enhanced policy
environment and development of small and medium agriculture-based enterprises.
ADB has approved fifteen loans totaling $57.8 million from the Asian Development Fund
(ADF) to Tonga since it joined ADB in 1972. Fifty-two technical assistance projects with a
value of $14.4 million were also provided to improve capacity and strengthen institutional
development in various sectors. Past ADB investments have focused on finance development
and infrastructure development in transport, power, agriculture, and fisheries.
Active projects in the country portfolio include five TAs. Their objectives are to (i) contribute to
private sector-led economic growth, increased income, and employment opportunities by
promoting micro small and medium enterprise development, (ii) design a countrywide program
for the development of youth microenterprises; (iii) improve the government's capacity for
strategic and development planning; (iv) improve the environment for the private sector by
rationalizing the government's portfolio of public enterprises, and (v) undertake a participatory
process to address the current ad hoc approach to urban management by developing an urban
planning and management strategy. The latest loan on Economic and Public Sector Reform was
completed successfully in 2004. Another TA on strengthening pro-poor policy in the Pacific for
Tonga for $0.2 million is being implemented on a regional basis to support economic sector
work and is not counted as country TA.
There was no lending program for 2005. One TA was approved for 2005 to prepare an
integrated urban development project, while three new TAs and one loan were discussed during
the country program mission for 2006. The proposed three TAs include (i) Public Enterprises
Reform Phase III for $0.4 million, (ii) Results-Based Management – Implementation of
Strategic Development Plan Eight for $0.55 million, and (iii) Population and Services Delivery
for $0.1 million. The planned loan was proposed under Urban Sector Basic Social Infrastructure
for $5 million. All these projects will be contingent upon confirmation with the government
during country program confirmation mission in 2006.

ANNEX VI

TONGA: STATISTICAL ISSUES
While economic statistics are broadly adequate for surveillance, data deficiencies continue to
hamper economic analysis and policy formulation. The Statistics Department (SD) and the
Ministry of Finance (MOF) have received, on a regular basis, technical assistance in national
accounts, government finance, and BOP statistics from the Pacific Financial Technical
Assistance Centre (PFTAC). The authorities, however, continue to report statistical data to the
Fund with long lags.
The two main sources of statistical information are the Quarterly Bulletin of the National
Reserve Bank of Tonga (NRBT), and the annual and semi-annual budget reports from the MOF.
STA is currently reviewing the country’s metadata to be posted on the IMF Data Standards
Bulletin Board in the near future.
National Accounts and Prices Statistics
The national accounts estimates are mainly based on the production approach and only rough
estimates are available on the expenditure components of GDP. The SD has completed the
revision of the gross domestic product (GDP) figures with a new base period (2000/01), based
on the results of a business establishment survey. This was done with the technical support and
assistance from the Secretariat for the Pacific Community. However, there were still large
inconsistencies in the data, especially for the agriculture, fishing and forestry, commerce, and
hotels and restaurants sectors. These inconsistencies are related to differences in the estimated
sectoral growth rates based on existing source data and the partial indicators used to derive
sectoral value added. In August 2004, at the request of the Minister of Finance, PFTAC
reviewed the system of national accounts, including the methodologies used in compiling the
production-based estimates, expenditure on GDP, and the income-based estimates of GDP. The
PFTAC mission made recommendations, including on ways to improve data sources and
methodologies and to revise estimates of GDP for recent years.
The current Consumer Price Index is based on a basket of goods and services derived from
the 1992/93 Household Income and Expenditure Survey. It has been recently rebased to
November 2002, with PFTAC’s assistance.
Government Finance Statistics
The FY 2002/03 Budget Statement introduced, for the first time, a presentation of fiscal data
according to GFS methodology. However, major improvements are needed to ensure that the
fiscal data are accurate and reliable. Proper classification of transactions is needed to permit
reconciliation with other available information (in particular, on domestic and external debt).
The existing lags in updating the accounting system with recent information on government
transactions need to be shortened. There are large discrepancies between budgetary figures from
above and below the line and poor cross–checking with the monetary survey. Published data
often are subject to large revisions.

- 47 -

ANNEX VI

Balance of Payments Statistics
Official BOP figures are compiled by the SD with long lags and are available only on an annual
basis. Monthly trade figures derived from customs documents are available with a three-month
lag. The NRBT compiles unofficial monthly BOP statistics based on the Overseas Exchange
Transactions records of the banking system with a six-week lag. There are significant
differences between the BOP estimates compiled by the two agencies. Moreover, large errors
and omissions suggest possible under recording of imports. Work is needed to reconcile the data
on stocks of reserve assets that are available from various data sources.
The MOF has put in place a system that provides detailed information on official sector external
disbursements and debt service.
Monetary and Financial Statistics
Monetary data are reported to STA in a timely fashion and are shared with APD through an
Integrated Database. In response to STA’s request, the authorities submitted test data that were
compiled using the new Standardized Report Forms (SRFs). These data have been approved for
publication in the forthcoming IFS Supplement.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2006 Article IV Consultation with Tonga
On June 2, 2006, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Tonga.1
Background
According to preliminary information, the economy is expected to expand at a slower pace in
2005/06 than the estimated 2½ percent gain in 2004/05 (fiscal year July-June), reflecting a poor
squash season and slower growth in construction. Inflation declined to 9½ percent in 2004/05
compared to about 11½ percent in the previous year, and has since eased further to 5¼ percent
during the year to February 2006, reflecting lower domestic food and import price increases.
A fiscal surplus of about 2½ of GDP was achieved in 2004/05, in marked contrast to the deficit of
2¼ percent of GDP envisaged in the budget, owing to lower-than-budgeted wages and capital
spending, and stronger tax collection. Net domestic credit grew by 21 percent in 2004/05, mainly
driven by a rapid rise in housing and personal loans. To rein in this rapid credit expansion, the
National Reserve Bank of Tonga (NRBT) reintroduced credit ceilings in January 2006. However,
with liquidity conditions tightening in the banking system, pressure on the central bank to ease its
monetary stance mounted, and reserve requirements were reduced in March.
In 2005/06, the original budget targeted a deficit of 1.8 percent of GDP, mostly covered by
external concessional financing. However, available information for the first eight months of
2005/06 indicates that revenue performance was weaker than expected, mainly because of lower
nontax and excise collection. Moreover, following a lengthy strike, civil servants were granted in
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return
to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive
Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board,
summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's
authorities.

-2September 2005 average wage increases of about 70 percent. The salary increase will be paid
over two years: 60 percent in 2005/06 and 40 percent in 2006/07. The unanticipated cost of the
first phase of the wage increase is estimated to be about 3 percent of GDP. Savings have been
carried out (mostly capital expenditure cuts and a hiring freeze) that are expected to more than
offset this cost as well as the likely revenue shortfall. The authorities are also working on
downsizing the civil service by a quarter by the end of the fiscal year, to be achieved by targeted
and voluntary redundancies, and the related severance payments could amount to about 5
percent of GDP.
The trade balance deteriorated in 2004/05, as imports expanded on the back of strong domestic
demand, more than offsetting a rebound in exports. Despite a continued increase in remittances,
the current account shifted into a deficit. The capital account surplus declined from its record high
in 2003/04, as private capital inflows returned to a more normal level. Gross international
reserves fell to 3¾ months of current year’s imports of goods and services. The pa’anga has
remained stable relative to its basket since 2004. Given the high inflation in Tonga relative to its
main trading partners, this development translated into a real appreciation of the Tongan currency
of about 11 percent (January 2004–February 2006).
Short-term economic prospects are highly uncertain and depend critically on the authorities
achieving the proposed substantial downsizing of the civil service. The swing in the fiscal position
from surplus to deficit is expected to contribute to a widening of the current account deficit in
2005/06. Only if an expected government asset sale to foreign investors is completed, will there
be sufficient financing to maintain the reserve position, keep the exchange rate broadly stable,
and prevent major inflationary pressures from emerging. In 2006/07, economic activity would be
adversely affected by the proposed civil service downsizing. The payment of the severance
package would cushion this effect somewhat, although it could also put pressure on reserves and
the exchange rate.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors expressed concern about the deterioration in the economic outlook since the
last Article IV consultation. They regretted that the large civil service wage increase in September
2005 marked a departure from the prudent fiscal policy that had been followed over the past
years, and underscored that the increase could have significant negative consequences for
macroeconomic and external stability.
Against this background, Directors considered that Tonga’s economic prospects were highly
uncertain and depended on the authorities’ ability to manage the impact of the wage settlement.
They urged the authorities to follow through on their stated intentions to contain the costs of the
wage settlement, and push ahead with key reforms to safeguard macroeconomic stability,
improve governance, and enhance the role of the private sector.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to fiscal adjustment, and stressed that more
sustainable fiscal measures were required. In this regard, they noted the ambitious plan
formulated by the authorities to bring the civil service down to a more appropriate size, based on
targeted and voluntary redundancies. Directors also noted, however, that the scale of the

-3envisaged downsizing was unprecedented, and cautioned that alternative measures may need to
be considered, should the proposed plan not materialize as expected.
Directors called on the authorities to push ahead with other fiscal reforms. They stressed that
strengthening the legal framework and capacity for tax enforcement would be critical to offset the
revenue decline in trade taxes expected from Tonga’s accession to the WTO. Directors added
that a fully operationalized accounting system, including its rollout to all ministries, would be
critical to improve public expenditure management. The introduction of a medium-term budget
framework signaling the authorities’ commitment to a sustainable fiscal policy would help foster
donor support. In addition, Directors emphasized that the pace of public enterprise reform should
be accelerated and, in particular, that the government should not renationalize the power sector.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ resolve to further tighten monetary policy in response to the
wage settlement, and utilize the full flexibility of the exchange rate system, if needed. In this
regard, the introduction of open-market type instruments was seen as a useful step to improve
the central bank’s control over monetary developments. Directors noted, however, that these new
instruments remained untested, and that the central bank might also need to rely on its more
rudimentary credit ceilings in the near term.
Directors noted that indicators of banking soundness had improved, although the recent rapid
expansion of credit was of some concern. In this regard, Directors encouraged the authorities to
continue to monitor closely credit developments to avoid a deterioration in asset quality. They
also called for an early enactment of the Amendments to the NRBT Act to strengthen central
bank independence. The authorities were encouraged to build on the progress made in the area
of Anti-Money Laundering/Combating Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) to address the
remaining issues.
Directors agreed on the need to create a more dynamic private sector in order to foster higher
growth. In this context, they supported the authorities’ decision to establish a public-private sector
task force to identify and reduce critical impediments to private sector development. In particular,
Directors called on the authorities to improve the business and investment climate by repealing
distortionary tax incentives, reducing restrictions on business licensing and foreign direct
investment, and strengthening the legal framework for securing property rights.
Directors encouraged the authorities to improve the reliability, coverage, and timeliness of
statistics to strengthen economic analysis and assist the authorities in conducting policies and
implementing reforms.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country (or countries)
concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations with member
countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program monitoring, and of ex
post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements. PINs are also issued
after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise decided by the Executive
Board in a particular case. The Staff Report for the 2006 Article IV Consultation with Tonga is also
available.
