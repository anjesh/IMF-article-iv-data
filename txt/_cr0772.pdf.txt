Bank of Algeria Mohammed Laksaci, Minister of Energy and Mining Chakib Khelil,
Delegate Minister for Financial Sector Reform Karim Djoudi, other senior officials,
members of parliament, the head of the largest trade union (UGTA), and
representatives from the banking and business community. S. Maherzi, Advisor to the
Executive Director for Algeria, participated in the discussions. The mission issued a
press statement and held a press conference at the end of its stay.
•
Algeria accepted the obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2(a), 3, and 4, in
September 1997. Algeria’s exchange rate regime is a managed float with no
preannounced path for the exchange rate.
•
Algeria effected in November 2005 the early and full repurchase of its past

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
•
A favorable external environment and appropriate macroeconomic policies have
contributed to Algeria’s encouraging economic performance over the past five years.
Economic growth has been sustained, inflation has remained low, and unemployment has
declined steadily, although it remains high. Growth is expected to decrease temporarily in
2006, reflecting lower hydrocarbon production, and inflation is picking up. The strong
expansion of hydrocarbon receipts has allowed a considerable increase in public investment
and a civil service wage increase. The external debt was largely prepaid in 2006 and the
external position has continued to strengthen.
•
Algeria’s economic outlook for the medium term is favorable. With world
hydrocarbon prices expected to remain relatively high, the current account surplus would
remain large and gross international reserves would rise further. Nonhydrocarbon GDP
growth would continue at about 5 percent. However, the planned sizeable increase in public
investment for the coming years and the spread of the civil service wage increase to the rest
of the economy would be expected to contribute to somewhat higher inflation.
•
Algeria’s key challenges are to achieve sustained growth and reduce
unemployment, while maintaining macroeconomic stability. The Article IV consultation
discussions focused on the sound management of the hydrocarbon receipts and key structural
reforms, in particular in the financial sector.
•
The ambitious public investment program requires sustained efforts to ensure
the quality of these expenditures. The authorities have begun reassessing the projects
included in the investment program and are committed to taking into account the
recommendations of the public expenditure review conducted in cooperation with the World
Bank. The recently concluded National Economic and Social Pact that supports linking real
wage increases to productivity growth and economic performance in the nonhydrocarbon
sector is an important milestone.
•
In view of the fiscal expansion and wage increases, a tightening of monetary
policy and a flexible management of the exchange rate will be required to keep inflation
under control. The authorities indicated that they intend to increase Bank of Algeria’s
policy interest rate to keep it at a positive level in real terms and to continue their flexible
management of the exchange rate.
•
The authorities are aware of the need to accelerate structural reforms aimed at
encouraging private investment and job creation. Moving ahead with the ongoing
banking sector reform, in particular the privatization of the first public bank is paramount.
The authorities intend to continue liberalizing external trade and to remain engaged in efforts
to deepen Maghreb regional cooperation. They also intend to accelerate other structural
reforms, in particular streamlining the tax system, completing the ongoing reform of the tax
administration, modernizing the customs administration, and to increase the pass-through of
word oil prices to domestic energy prices.

5
I. BACKGROUND AND KEY CHALLENGES
1.
A favorable external environment and appropriate macroeconomic policies
have contributed to Algeria’s encouraging economic performance over the past five
years. Economic growth has been sustained at an average annual rate of 5½ percent in
2001–05, and inflation has remained low. The unemployment rate has declined steadily,
although it was still high at 15.3 percent in 2005.1 Algeria’s position as an important
hydrocarbon exporter has resulted in marked improvements to the country’s fiscal and
external positions.2
2.
Algeria’s political situation is fairly stable. In May 2006, Prime Minister Ahmed
Ouyahia was replaced by Mr. Abdelaziz Belkhadem, general secretary of the main party
in the ruling coalition. The new prime minister has indicated that he would support a
constitutional amendment that would allow the president to run for a third term.
Parliamentary elections are scheduled to take place in 2007 and presidential elections
in 2009.
3.
Algeria’s key challenges are to achieve sustained growth and reduce
unemployment, while maintaining macroeconomic stability. The government’s
economic program for 2005–09 addresses these challenges by (a) using part of the
hydrocarbon revenues for public investment in key sectors such as infrastructure, housing,
education, and healthcare, while continuing appropriate macroeconomic policies; and
(b) undertaking structural reforms, particularly in the financial sector, to achieve the
transition to an open, market-oriented economy. Fund surveillance in recent years has
focused on these areas. The authorities have indicated their appreciation of Fund policy
advice and technical assistance, and have drawn on it in their policy making.

1

Excluding a sharp increase in work at home/temporary employment in 2004–05, staff estimated the
unemployment rate at just below 21 percent in 2005 (See the Selected Issues paper on “The Labor
Market and Unemployment in Algeria”, forthcoming). The youth unemployment rate stood at 31 percent
in 2005.

2

Algeria is the world’s third largest exporter of natural gas, having the eight-largest proven reserves, and the
world’s tenth largest oil exporter. In 2004, gas production was 225 million cubic meters/day (about 3 percent
of world production) and production of liquid petroleum products was 1.9 million barrels/day (about
2½ percent of world production).

Inflation is picking up.
Consumer price inflation remained
low through mid-2006 but increased
to almost 5 percent (year-on-year) in
September, reflecting mainly a
rebound in food prices, which had
declined with the good 2005 crop.

Algeria’s external position
continued to improve in 2006. With
high world oil prices, the external
current account surplus is projected
to increase further to 24½ percent of
GDP from almost 21 percent in
2005. Gross external reserves
reached $70 billion at
end-September 2006 (two years of
next years’ import cover). After
early debt repayment of
$10½ billion, including to Paris and
London Club creditors, the external
debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to
decline from 17 percent in 2005 to
below 4½ percent in 2006.

The authorities last increased the minimum wage by 25 percent in January 2004 from its level of January 2001,
which had only a limited effect on the wage structure.

9

Box 2. Prepayment of External Debt, 2004–06
In light of large hydrocarbon export receipts, the authorities decided in 2004 to prepay official external debt,
and limit nonconcessional borrowing. Since 2004, Algeria has repaid about $14 billion official external debt
ahead of schedule.
At end-2003, Algeria’s external debt of $23.4 billion (excluding Soviet-era debt owed to Russia) included
$12.2 billion of rescheduled debt to Paris and London Club creditors and $5 billion to multilateral creditors.
In 2004–05, Algeria prepaid $3.3 billion, particularly to multilateral creditors, including the Fund. In March
2006, Russia cancelled $4.7 billion Soviet-era claims in exchange for Algeria agreeing to import an
equivalent amount of Russian goods and services over an unspecified time period. This paved the way for
Paris Club approval in May 2006 of Algeria’s request to prepay its outstanding debt at par. Following
bilateral negotiations, Paris and London Club debt worth $8.5 billion had been prepaid by end-2006. A
further $2 billion was also prepaid to multilateral creditors in 2006.
Algeria’s external debt-to-GDP ratio has declined from about 34 percent of GDP at end-2003 to less than
4½ percent at end-2006; it is projected to fall to 3 percent by 2011. At the same time, the reserve cover ratio
has increased from 18 months in 2003 to almost 25 months in 2006, and is projected to reach 38 months by
2011. Under the circumstances, Algeria’s external debt would remain sustainable over the medium term.
Building on this, the authorities intend to obtain a sovereign rating.
Algeria’s participation as a creditor in the Enhanced HIPC Initiative awaits approval by the authorities.

Monetary policy has remained
prudent, in line with the authorities’
objective of containing inflation. BA
continued to absorb most of the excess
liquidity of the banking system through
deposit auctions in 2006, in reaction to
the fiscal stimulus and the rapidly
growing bank deposits of the national oil
company (Sonatrach). The expansion of
credit to the economy slowed.

Some progress was made in structural reforms in 2006. In the financial sector, the
process of privatizing a first public bank and the modernization of the payments system are
underway. The governance of the remaining public banks is being strengthened and
supervision has become more active,
mainly through on-site inspections.

liberalizes investment in this sector; in
2006, the authorities amended the new law to restore Sonatrach’s majority stake in all
contracts with international hydrocarbon companies. Privatization of public enterprises is
proceeding and an anticorruption law was adopted in January 2006.
B. Medium-Term Outlook
11.
Algeria’s external position is expected to remain strong over the medium term.
With oil prices projected to remain relatively high and given the authorities’ decision to limit
the expansion of hydrocarbon output, annual hydrocarbon exports are expected to average
$55½ billion through 2011. Imports would increase significantly, driven by large investments
by the government and Sonatrach. The external current account surplus, while gradually
declining, would remain sizable and gross external reserves would exceed three years of
import cover by 2011. Gross external debt would remain low and sustainable.

4

The tax rate will be 6 percent of turnover for traders and 12 percent of turnover for other small businesses.

11
12.
Algeria’s economic outlook for the medium term is favorable. The authorities
agreed with staff that medium-term growth prospects depend importantly on the country’s
ability to address key constraints to growth. Assuming steady implementation of the public
investment program and of ongoing structural reforms, real NHGDP growth is projected at
5½ percent in 2007 and about 5 percent thereafter. Achieving a higher growth trend would
require more ambitious structural reforms.5 The planned increase in public investment and
the spread of the public sector wage hike to the rest of the economy would contribute to some
inflationary pressures in the coming years.

The draft 2007 budget includes a sizeable increase in public spending over the
medium term. The 2005–09 public investment program would be increased to some
$113 billion (equal to 2006 GDP). Taking account of the full-year effect of the civil service
wage increase and of current expenditure needs over the medium term, the nonhydrocarbon
primary deficit would increase to about 39 percent of NHGDP in 2007; thereafter it would
gradually decline to 31 percent of NHGDP by 2011, in line with long-term fiscal
sustainability. The overall budget surplus would remain above 7 percent of GDP through
2011.

Box 3. Long-Term Fiscal Sustainability
Staff’s long-term fiscal framework for assessing the management of hydrocarbon wealth aims at preserving the
permanent per capita income from hydrocarbon wealth (see IMF Country Report No. 04/33; IMF Country
Report No. 06/93). This is expressed as a sustainable path for the nonhydrocarbon primary deficit/NHGDP ratio.
In this framework, the sustainable nonhydrocarbon primary deficit would decrease from about 37½ percent of
NHGDP in 2006 to 32½ percent in 2010 (compared to 26 percent estimated at the time of the 2005 Article IV
consultation). Income from financial wealth would entirely finance the deficit that prevails after 2050 when
hydrocarbon reserves are assumed to run out. Given the volatility of world oil prices, it is important that the
authorities continue to maintain fiscal sustainability over the long term.

III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
14.
The discussions were characterized by broad agreement between authorities and
staff on the key economic challenges facing Algeria and policies needed to address
them. The authorities concurred that Algeria’s strong financial position creates an ideal
window of opportunity for accelerating reforms and tackling key impediments to private
sector-led growth. The discussions centered on (a) the management of hydrocarbon resources
and macroeconomic policies; and (b) key structural reforms, notably in the banking sector.
A. Management of Hydrocarbon Revenue and Macroeconomic Policies
15.
The authorities have enhanced the transparency in the use of hydrocarbon
revenue in the budget. In the 2006 supplementary budget, the rules of the hydrocarbon
stabilization fund—Fonds de Régulation des Recettes (FRR)—were amended to allow for the
direct financing of the nonhydrocarbon deficit (unless the balance of the FRR drops below
10 billion), broadly in line with staff advice (see IMF Country Report No. 06/93).6 Moreover,
6

Algeria's hydrocarbon stabilization fund is a sub-account of the government at the central bank, in dinars and
with a low interest rate. Inflows into the account are hydrocarbon budgetary receipts above the equivalent of
$19 per barrel; outflows are for debt amortization and the financing of the remaining nonhydrocarbon deficit.

13
the draft 2007 budget informs parliament of the implicit price of a barrel of oil equivalent to
the hydrocarbon revenue needed to finance the nonhydrocarbon deficit (2007: $49 per
barrel). However, the budget reference price has been kept at $19 per barrel for budget
presentation purposes.
Fiscal Policy
16.
Discussions focused on the 2006–09 public investment program, wage policy, and
structural fiscal issues.
The authorities were keenly aware of the challenge of ensuring the high quality
of public investment in light of the limited absorption capacity. They indicated that they
have already begun to reevaluate the projects included in the public investment program, in
order to focus on projects with a high rate of return, and have strengthened the monitoring
and evaluation mechanisms for large investment projects. The authorities were also
committed to taking into account the recommendations of the public expenditure review
conducted in cooperation with the World Bank in 2005–06.
•

•
The National Economic and Social Pact—concluded in 2006 between the
government, employers’ organizations, and trade unions—supports, for the first time,
linking real wage increases to productivity and economic performance in the
nonhydrocarbon sector, in line with past staff advice. In addition, the Pact supports efforts
to improve the business climate for private enterprise, enhance the productivity of the
economy, and privatize public enterprises. Decentralized wage negotiations are underway
and will likely result in wage increases broadly in line with that granted to the civil service.
The Pact provides that future wage demands will not be based on hydrocarbon revenues and
the unions indicated that they have agreed to hold off demands for another general wage
increase until 2009–10.
•
The government intends to take
Figure 9. Algeria and Competitors:
Overall Ease of Doing Business, 2006
advantage of buoyant hydrocarbon
revenues to simplify the tax and incentive
system for business activity. The
authorities concurred that the development
of Algeria’s nonhydrocarbon economy
requires a significant improvement in the
business climate. However, structural
reforms will take time to mature. Therefore,

accelerated by focusing on measures with a
more rapid payoff, and have requested FAD technical assistance to streamline further the tax
system and assist them in the ongoing modernization of the tax administration.

Box 4. The 2005–06 Public Expenditure Review
The public expenditure review (PER) was conducted between October 2005 and June 2006. It covered four
sectors: health, education, water, and transport/public works. The PER also assessed the performance of
budgetary management.
Diagnosis
The PER found that Algeria has made important progress in education and public healthcare. However, it found
severe shortcomings in the planning and execution of public investment. General, cross-sector concerns
included:
•

the technical readiness of personnel in charge of executing projects is generally low and unlikely to be
improved by large upfront spending authorizations;

•

existing weaknesses in absorption capacity entail substantial risks that costs could be excessive;

•

project quality is uneven and would only partially achieve the objectives of sectoral strategies;

•

several projects fail to meet minimum standards and should not proceed.

Main recommendations
•

The pace of implementation of the public investment program should reflect a more realistic assessment of
the absorption capacity of line ministries.

•

A more even implementation of the investment program than currently planned is proposed starting with the
2007 budget.

•

Project selection should be more closely guided by sectoral strategies in the context of a
medium-term expenditure framework.

•

Management and control systems for public investment and the budget should be urgently modernized.

•
The government is poised to modernize budget management and strengthen
fiscal governance. It intends to submit the draft organic law on public finances to parliament
before end-2006 and has prepared a new budget classification system, in line with
Government Finance Statistics guidelines. The authorities indicated that they envisage
implementing other recommendations of the 2004 fiscal ROSC in the period ahead.
Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
17.
Keeping inflation under control will be the key challenge for BA. The monetary
authorities considered that the fiscal expansion and wage increases will require tightening
monetary policy to forestall inflationary pressures. They indicated that they intend to
increase BA’s policy interest rate to keep it at a positive level in real terms and to continue
absorbing excess liquidity in the banking system.7

7

In September 2006, BA’s policy interest rate stood at 1.7 percent and average CPI inflation was at 1.3 percent.

15
18.
The authorities intend to continue managing the exchange rate in a flexible
manner, taking account of the inflation objective. Staff found no evidence of
misalignment of the real exchange rate.8 In the short term, the REER would be subject to
offsetting influences. The

To achieve lasting gains in
competitiveness, given prevailing wage levels in Algeria, it is essential to implement
structural reforms aimed at increasing the productivity of the economy.

B. Structural Reforms
Reform of the Financial Sector
19.
The authorities considered that further progress on financial sector reform
aimed at improving the soundness of the banking system and strengthening financial
intermediation is a priority to sustain growth in the nonhydrocarbon sector. They have
requested a Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) update, which is scheduled for
early 2007. Discussions focused on the ongoing banking sector reform and the financial
relationship between public banks and public enterprises.
•
The privatization of the first public bank is proceeding as planned. The sale of a
majority share in Crédit Populaire d’Algérie is expected to be completed in early 2007.
Subsequently, other public banks may also be privatized. The objective of the government is
to select banks with an internationally established reputation as majority shareholders, in
order to inject modern know-how into the sector.

8

The fundamentals of the equilibrium real effective exchange rate are Algeria’s labor productivity differential
with trading partners and the real oil price (See IMF County Report No. 05/52). The impact of the recent oil
price increase is offset by the relatively low labor productivity growth in Algeria, leaving the equilibrium real
effective exchange rate almost flat in recent years.

16
•
Steps are also being taken to strengthen the governance of the remaining public
banks. Performance contracts for public banks have been strengthened and the authorities
are focusing their efforts in particular on improving risk management and internal controls.
•
The authorities agreed that greater competition in the banking sector and
further improving the operational framework will strengthen financial intermediation.
Steadfast progress is being made through the ongoing modernization of the payment system,
sustained political support of the banking commission in enforcing prudential regulations,
and improving banking supervision, with Fund technical assistance. However, the directive
prohibiting public entities from dealing with private banks remains an obstacle to better
promoting a level playing field.
•
There is a need to establish a more sound and transparent relationship between
public banks and public enterprises. The government is in the process of taking over
nonperforming loans of public banks to public enterprises in an amount equivalent to
4 percent of GDP. It is determined to avoid new nonperforming loans from arising by strictly
limiting bank financing of nonviable public enterprises, but has not yet decided on the
measures needed to achieve this.
Other Structural Reforms
20.
The authorities intend to continue liberalizing external trade and to remain
engaged in regional integration efforts. Following the coming into effect of the
Association Agreement with the European Union in 2005, the authorities are now focusing
on Algeria’s accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO). The government has also
decided to modernize and streamline the customs administration, with Fund technical
assistance. Gradually enhancing regional cooperation and eventually establishing a large
regional market will help Algeria to better harness the benefits of multilateral liberalization.
In this context, the authorities intend to implement the action plan resulting from the 2005
Maghreb trade facilitation conference to: (a) set up a website with comprehensive
information on trade regulations and taxation; (b) work toward mutual recognition of norms
and controls; (c) reduce trade distortions and informal trade; (d) develop a one-stop
document-processing system; and (e) establish a private sector-led monitoring unit on
Maghreb foreign trade. The forthcoming conference on financial sector reform and prospects
for financial integration in the Maghreb will also help to intensify regional cooperation.
21.
Although the authorities acknowledged that improving the legal framework for
foreign exchange transactions would help Algeria benefit from its opening up to the rest
of the world, they have not yet followed through on their intention to promulgate a new
draft foreign exchange regulation that implements the recommendations of Fund
technical assistance in this regard (IMF Country Report No. 06/93). The authorities have
indicated that this regulation, that will clearly establish the current convertibility of the dinar,
will be promulgated shortly.

would be reduced gradually by
raising domestic energy prices after
2007. However, the authorities were concerned about the social impact of such increases and
asked staff to advise in the coming months on the modalities of such price increases and on
targeted measures to protect the most vulnerable groups.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
23.
In recent years, Algeria has succeeded in using its ample hydrocarbon revenues to
sustain economic growth and bring down the still high unemployment, while keeping
inflation low. The external position has improved significantly with the build-up of
international reserves and prepayment of most of the external debt. Progress continued to be
made in structural reforms.
24.
Algeria’s external position is expected to remain strong and growth prospects are
favorable. However, as the temporary slowdown in 2006 has shown, growth remains fragile
and mainly driven by government investment. Also, the envisaged fiscal expansion and the
impact of wage increases would result in some inflationary pressures.
25.
The country’s increased political stability and favorable financial situation present an
excellent opportunity for achieving high, sustainable growth and reducing unemployment,
while maintaining macroeconomic stability. This requires: (a) ensuring sound management
of hydrocarbon resources, notably the high quality of the large public investment program;
and (b) pressing ahead with the modernization of financial intermediation and other
structural reforms to increase productivity and improve the business climate.
26.
The ambitious public investment program requires sustained efforts to ensure its
quality. In addition to the steps being taken by the government, staff recommends that the
authorities focus on the execution and monitoring of existing projects. It is also important to

between prices of hydrocarbon products on the domestic and world markets amounted to 7½ percent of GDP.

18
prepare comprehensive medium-term budget projections, taking into account the implication
of public investment on current expenditures, to accelerate budget modernization, and to
strengthen fiscal governance by implementing the recommendations of the 2004 fiscal
ROSC.
27.
Staff welcomes the new rules governing the hydrocarbon stabilization fund and, in
view of the expected large increase in its balance, recommends aiming at a higher investment
return.
28.
The National Economic and Social Pact is an important milestone. Staff recommends
that real wages be adjusted more gradually than in the past, in line with productivity growth
and economic performance in the nonhydrocarbon sector.
29.
Given the need to tighten monetary policy, staff welcomes the authorities’ intention
to bring BA’s policy interest rate to a positive level in real terms. It reiterates that handling
Sonatrach’s large deposits outside the banking system would strengthen BA’s control over
base money. It is important that BA continue its flexible management of the exchange rate.
30.
Pushing ahead decisively with the privatization of public banks, strengthening the
governance of remaining public banks, and promoting competition in the sector are
paramount. Staff also emphasizes the need to strictly limit bank lending to nonviable public
enterprises and, if necessary, provide assistance through direct government subsidies
accompanied by enterprise restructuring and acceleration of privatization.
31.
Following the coming into effect of the Association Agreement with the European
Union, it is important to pursue the negotiations for Algeria’s accession to the WTO. Staff
welcomes the authorities’ decision to modernize the customs administration. Enhanced
regional integration will also help Algeria realize its full economic potential and enhance its
attractiveness to foreign investors. As a first step, staff welcomes the authorities’ intention to
implement the action plan to reduce obstacles to regional trade that resulted from the 2005
conference on trade facilitation in the Maghreb.
32.
Staff urges the authorities to promulgate as soon as possible the new draft exchange
regulation, which should remove remaining ambiguities regarding the current convertibility
of the dinar.
33.
It is important to continue to improve the business climate, including by simplifying
the tax system for business activity. Staff also welcomes the intention of the government to
gradually increase the pass-through of world oil prices to domestic energy prices.
34.
Staff strongly encourages the authorities to intensify their efforts to upgrade the
production and dissemination of economic and financial statistics, including by benefiting
from the needed technical assistance under the GDDS.

19
35.
Staff encourages Algeria to participate as a creditor in the Enhanced HIPC Initiative,
and to obtain a sovereign rating.
36.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard
12-month cycle.

1/ Includes impact of public banks' restructuring packages. The conversion of public banks' claims on public
enterprises into claims on the government results in a decrease in credit to the economy and an equal increase
in credit to government. The adjustment amounted to DA 213 billion in 2006. The flow of new credits to the
economy in 2003 (17.5 percent annual growth) exceeded the stock difference between 2002 and 2003, because
of the liquidation of two private banks. The flow of new credits to the economy in 2006 (6.5 percent annual
growth) exceeded the stock difference between 2005 and 2006.
2/ Net credit to government excludes postal accounts (CCP) at the treasury deposited at the BA.
3/ The advance of BA to the treasury is in respect of early payments by the government of rescheduled debt
to the Paris and London Clubs in 2006. The external payment is reflected in NFA in 2006; the additional claim
of BA on the government (the treasury advance) will be drawn down in accordance with the original Paris/
London Club rescheduling terms over 2007–11.
4/ Includes the debt rescheduling proceeds blocked in special accounts at the Bank of Algeria.
5/ Includes postal accounts (CCP) and deposits of non-bank financial institutions (DA 3.4 billion in 2003;
DA 4.6 billion in 2004; DA 0.8 billion in 2005).

From January 21, 1974 to October 1, 1994, the exchange rate of the dinar was determined on
the basis of a fixed relationship with a basket of currencies, adjusted from time to time. On

31
October 1, 1994, the Bank of Algeria introduced a managed float for the dinar through daily
fixing sessions that included six commercial banks. This system has been replaced by an
interbank foreign exchange market as of January 2, 1996. At the end of September 2006, the
average of the buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar was $1 = DA 72.12, equivalent to
SDR 1 = DA 106.47. No margin limits are imposed on the buying and selling exchange rates
in the interbank foreign exchange market, except for a margin of DA 0.017 between the
buying and selling rates of the Bank of Algeria for the dinar against the U.S. dollar.
The exchange regime is a managed float with no preannounced path for the exchange rate.
Full surrender requirements are in effect on hydrocarbon export proceeds. Limits on the
making of payments for invisible transactions and current transfers, which have remained
since Algeria accepted the obligations of Article VIII, sections 2(a), 3, and 4, in 1997, are
indicative according to the authorities. Inward direct investment is generally free of
restrictions; controls are maintained on other capital account payments and transfers.
Latest Article IV Consultation
The discussions for the 2005 Article IV consultation with Algeria were held in Algiers
during October 1–16, 2005. The staff report (IMF Country Report No 06/93) was discussed
by the Executive Board on February 13, 2006 and published on March 9, 2006.

Appendix II. Algeria: Relations with the World Bank
(As of October 31, 2006)
The Algeria Country Assistance Strategy was discussed by the World Bank Board on
June 12, 2003, and a Country Assistance Strategy Progress Report was distributed to the
Board on August 9, 2005. The proposed support of the Bank Group for 2004–06 aims at:
(a) strengthening fiscal sustainability and hydrocarbon revenue management to build the
basis for sustained growth; (b) removing the constraints to private sector-led growth,
particularly those affecting the business environment, SMEs, the financial sector, and
infrastructure development; and (c) supporting the government’s efforts to articulate and
implement a strategy for better service delivery, particularly in water supply, transport,
housing, environmental services and human development to meet the critical needs of the
population. The Bank Group’s support is guided by three principles: (a) selectivity through
engagement in a limited number of areas and a selective use of Bank instruments; (b)
programmatic approaches focused on transfer of knowledge and capacity building; and (c)
partnerships, outreach and knowledge sharing.
The World Bank portfolio in Algeria comprises 7 active operations and 67 closed loans, with
cumulative net commitments of $4.3 billion, of which $4.1 billion have been repaid. Net
commitments for the 7 current operations amount to $83.5 million. Of the 7 operations, 4
will be closed by end of FY07, leaving only 3 operations with a total net commitment of
$45.1million, of which $17.2 million have been disbursed. No new loans have been approved
since FY03. In FY06 the Government prepaid $637 million of 22 IBRD loans, and cancelled
$176.9 million of loans for active operations.
Recent analytical work includes policy notes on poverty, the transport sector, and the legal
and business environment (FY05). A Public Expenditure Review was prepared in FY06 (in
close collaboration with the IMF) and the findings presented to the authorities during a high
level workshop held in Algiers during July 2006. During FY07, the Bank projects to develop
further analytical work on the macroeconomic impact of the public investment program,
trade and labor market issues, as well as to explore potential for capacity building activities
on poverty and the statistical system. Other ongoing analytical work includes an Education
Sector Note, Financial Sector TA, Health Sector TA, Doing Business TA, and policy notes
on the macroeconomic impact of the public investment program, trade, and the labor market.
The authorities have expressed interest in Reimbursable Technical Assistance (RTA) from
the World Bank. Ongoing RTA activities include preparations for private management of
water services in three cities, and capacity building for the Caisse Nationale d’Equipement et
de Développement (CNED). New RTA programs are expected to start soon in the
environment sector and with Sonatrach.

Appendix III. Algeria: Statistical Issues
Algeria’s data provision to the Fund is broadly adequate for effective surveillance, but there
are serious weaknesses particularly in government finance statistics. The lack of financial
resources allocated to the compilation of statistics, insufficient interagency coordination, as
well as concerns about accuracy and subsequent reluctance to publish provisional data, are
partly responsible for this situation.
Algeria has decided to participate in the GDDS in February 2006. The authorities have
nominated a national coordinator and are in the process of producing GDDS metadata.
GDDS participation and technical issues will be discussed during the STA multisector
statistics mission scheduled for early 2007.
Real Sector
Real sector data is reported to STA on an irregular basis and with substantial lags. The latest
national accounts information published in the International Financial Statistics (IFS)
pertains to partial data reported for 2003. IFS import trade data at current prices are derived
from Direction of Trade Statistics. The September 2002 multisector statistics mission
recommended that priority be given to move the compilation of national accounts to 1993
SNA. STA missions visited Algiers during 2004–05 to assist the National Statistical Office
with the development of quarterly national accounts.
Government Finance
Algeria reported government finance statistics (GFS) for the period 1994–2002 for
publication in the GFS Yearbook. However, the institutional coverage of the data reported is
limited to Budgetary Central Government, albeit in a wide sense, including the general
budget, the annexed budget, and the special treasury accounts. Clarification has been sought
from the authorities regarding the recording of the latter (net versus gross recording). No
sub-annual data are submitted for IFS publication.
The September 2002 multisector statistics mission recommended the designation of a
coordinator and the assignment of at least one economist for the compilation of GFS data.
The authorities have not yet followed up on their initial intention to assign GFS leadership to
the General Directorate of Accounting in the ministry of finance. A first step would be the
establishment of an automated bridge table between the detailed monthly Treasury ledger
(Balance générale), regularly produced by the latter, and the GFS table (Situation Résumée
des Opérations du Trésor—SROT) in order to ensure a more timely production of quarterly
and monthly GFS, as well as a more timely report to the Fund of quarterly data that fully

36
reconcile the SROT presentation of government finances with the budget presentation. The
ongoing changeover to an enhanced chart of accounts of the Treasury would offer an ideal
opportunity to revamp the way GFS compilation is organized and carried out in Algeria.
The mission further recommended (a) that proceeds of the oil stabilization fund (FRR) be
shown as revenue (rather than financing); (b) the compilation of more detailed breakdowns,
in particular relating to the item “other transfers”; (c) a more appropriate reporting of the
three large debt assumption operations carried out over the past decade; and (d) further work
on the financing and the reconciliation with monetary statistics. The mission noted that
meeting the GDDS and eventually the SDDS standards would require substantial efforts in
terms of extension of coverage (consolidating the operations of social security and Wilayate,
and subsequently of other administrative bodies and municipalities).
Monetary Accounts
Monetary data are broadly adequate for policy formulation and monitoring of economic
developments. In particular, coverage has improved with the consolidation of data from the
national savings bank (CNEP) beginning December 1998 and banking operations conducted
by the National Mutual Fund for Agriculture (CNMA-banque) beginning January 2002.
However, reporting of balance sheet data by some state-owned commercial banks is very
untimely, and most commercial banks do not report the complete data needed to compile the
monetary survey. Prudential data reported by banks are untimely and unreliable on the part
of state-owned banks. The May 2006 monetary and financial statistics mission reiterated a
long standing recommendation to strictly enforce the reporting obligations of banks by
introducing high penalties. The mission also recommended to further extend the coverage of
monetary statistics to include operations of finance companies and undertake a major
revision of the outdated chart of accounts and accounting guidelines applied to banks and
finance companies.
Balance of Payments
The September 2002 multisector statistics mission noted the following: (a) the Bank of
Algeria’s legal authority to collect data is limited to banking and financial institutions only;
(b) data sources need to be expanded by conducting enterprise surveys in addition to
traditional exchange-based records; (c) a more rigorous and uniform application of the
residency criterion should be followed; (d) quarterly data are compiled but not regularly
disseminated; and (e) international investment position data are not compiled. Algeria does
not report Balance of Payments data to STA, and there are no BOP data in IFS or in the
BOPSY. These issues will be examined during the forthcoming multisector statistics mission.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
February 7, 2007

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2006 Article IV Consultation with
Algeria
On January 10, 2007, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Algeria.1
Background
Real GDP growth temporarily declined to about 3 percent in 2006, largely because of a
drop in hydrocarbon output for technical reasons. Nonhydrocarbon GDP (NHGDP)
growth would continue at 4½ percent, underpinned by sustained activity in the
construction sector, resulting from the significant fiscal impulse, and agriculture. Inflation
remained low through mid-year but is picking up, reflecting a rebound in food prices.
Favorable hydrocarbon prices on international markets further strengthened Algeria’s
external position. The current account surplus is projected to increase to 24½ percent of
GDP from almost 21 percent in 2005. Gross external reserves reached US$70 billion at
end-September 2006 (2 years of import cover). After early debt repayment, in particular
to the Paris and London Clubs, the external debt-to-GDP ratio would decline from
17 percent in 2005 to below 4½ percent in 2006.
Buoyant hydrocarbon revenues have enabled a strong increase in public spending. The
2005–09 public investment program was increased considerably, and civil service wages
were raised by about 15–16 percent on average. As a result, the nonhydrocarbon
primary deficit is expected to widen from about 33½ percent of NHGDP in 2005 to
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities.

2

almost 37½ percent in 2006, but the overall budget surplus would remain at about
12 percent of GDP in 2006.
Monetary policy remained prudent, in line with the authorities’ objective of containing
inflation. The Bank of Algeria continued to absorb most of the excess liquidity of the
banking system through deposit auctions in 2006 and the expansion of credit to the
economy slowed.
Some progress was made in structural reforms. The privatization of one public bank and
the modernization of the payments system are underway. The governance of the
remaining public banks is being strengthened and supervision has become more active,
mainly through on-site inspections. However, nonperforming loans of public banks
remained high. The corporate profit tax rate was reduced from 30 percent to 25 percent,
and the taxation of small enterprises was streamlined by introducing a single
presumptive tax. Privatization of public enterprises is proceeding and an anticorruption
law was adopted in January 2006.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for their prudent macroeconomic policies
and welcomed Algeria’s encouraging economic performance in recent years, noting the
decline in the unemployment rate, sustained economic growth, low inflation, and
comfortable external and fiscal positions in the wake of high world energy prices.
Looking forward, Directors agreed that the country’s increased political stability and
favorable financial situation present an invaluable window of opportunity for achieving
high growth and further reducing unemployment, while maintaining macroeconomic
stability. They underscored the importance of ensuring sound management of
hydrocarbon resources and pressing ahead vigorously with structural reforms to
increase productivity and improve the business climate.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ ongoing reassessment of projects included in the
public investment program and the commitment to take into account the
recommendations of the public expenditure review conducted in cooperation with the
World Bank. They cautioned that, given the limited absorptive capacity, a slower pace of
project implementation may be desirable to ensure a high quality of the public
investment program and avoid undue strain on monetary policy. In addition, they
encouraged the authorities to focus on the execution and monitoring of existing projects,
accelerate budget modernization, and strengthen fiscal governance by implementing the
recommendations of the 2004 fiscal Reports on the Observance of Standards and
Codes.
Directors noted the authorities’ intention to maintain fiscal sustainability over the medium
term. In this context, they welcomed the new rules governing the hydrocarbon
stabilization fund and recommended aiming at a higher investment return. They were
also encouraged by the recently concluded National Economic and Social Pact, which

3

supports linking real wage increases to productivity growth and economic performance in
the nonhydrocarbon sector, noting that it would help preserve Algeria’s competitiveness
as the economy opens up further.
Directors commended the authorities for the prudent conduct of monetary policy that has
kept inflation under control. In light of the expected external inflows, the planned
increase in public investment, and the wage increases, Directors welcomed the
authorities’ intention to pursue a tight monetary policy stance. In this respect, they
supported the authorities’ intentions to maintain the Bank of Algeria’s policy interest rate
positive in real terms and to continue managing the exchange rate in a flexible manner.
Directors were of the view that financial sector reform and a significant deepening of
financial intermediation will be necessary to foster private sector activity. In this respect,
they pointed to the need to push ahead decisively with the privatization of public banks,
strengthen the governance of the remaining public banks, and promote competition in
the banking sector, while avoiding bank lending to nonviable public enterprises. Directors
also looked forward to the update of the 2003 Financial Sector Assessment Program.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ pursuit of WTO accession and their intention to
implement the action plan to reduce obstacles to regional trade following the 2005
conference on trade facilitation in the Maghreb. They welcomed the recent promulgation
of the new exchange regulation that is aimed at removing the remaining ambiguities
regarding the current convertibility of the dinar.
Directors urged the authorities to accelerate other structural reforms, in particular
streamlining the tax system, completing the ongoing reform of the tax administration, and
modernizing the customs administration. They also welcomed the authorities’ intention to
gradually increase the pass-through of world oil prices to domestic energy prices.
Directors praised the authorities’ policy to prepay external debt and encouraged Algeria
to participate as a creditor in the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative,
and obtain a sovereign rating.
Directors encouraged the authorities to intensify their efforts to upgrade the production
and dissemination of economic and financial statistics, including by benefiting from
technical assistance under the General Data Dissemination System.

Statement by Abbas Mirakhor, Executive Director for Algeria
January 10, 2007
My authorities thank staff for the well-focused report and helpful Selected Issues (SI) paper.
They appreciate the high-quality Fund policy dialogue, advice, and technical assistance, and
highly value management and the Executive Board’s support for Algeria’s sustained reform
efforts. They broadly agree with staff’s assessment of the recent economic developments,
challenges ahead, and policies required for growth acceleration.
Prudent macroeconomic policies and continued structural reforms, supported by higher oil
prices and improved political and security situations, have underpinned recent favorable
economic developments. Following high growth rates, low inflation, and strong fiscal and
external positions in 2001–05, the economy continued to perform well in 2006. While
hydrocarbon output declined due to the need to improve maintenance and upgrade production
facilities, nonhydrocarbon sector continued to expand at a healthy rate, underpinned by
strong activity in the construction sector, nongovernment services, and agriculture, leading to
a reduction in unemployment. Prudent monetary policy kept inflation under control, fiscal
position strengthened further, with the overall surplus reaching 12 percent of GDP on
account of higher revenues, and the external position improved significantly, with the current
account surplus exceeding 24 percent of GDP, allowing for further accumulation of
international reserves. As indicated in the staff report (Box 2), with the settlement of the
Russian debt issue, the government accelerated the early repayment of the external
obligations, including to Paris Club and London Club creditors, bringing the debt-to-GDP
ratio down to less than 4.5 percent from 34 percent at end-2003.
The authorities remain strongly committed to their reform agenda to strengthen private sector
participation in the economy, further reduce unemployment, and improve the living
conditions of the population while maintaining macroeconomic stability. Priority actions
include continued implementation of the 2005–09 Growth Consolidation Plan (GCP),
strengthening financial intermediation, and improving the business climate. Fiscal
sustainability remains the anchor of the authorities’ strategy. The substantial accumulation of
savings in the hydrocarbon stabilization fund over the past years reflects the prudent
management of oil revenue and provides room for investment in infrastructure and social
spending. The former is set to increase over the medium term, in line with the GCP’s
objectives while the latter will focus on housing, education, and health. The authorities are
determined to enhance the quality of public investment, therefore, they are carefully
considering the recommendations of the public expenditure review recently conducted with
the assistance of the World Bank. Particular attention is paid to keeping the pace of
implementation in line with the economy’s absorptive capacity. Sustained efforts will also be
devoted to contain current spending. As staff note, the recent wage increase was meant
largely to compensate for past large compression of real wages. Looking forward, the
principles set forth in the National Economic and Social Pact (NESP), recently concluded
between the government, employers, and trade unions, will govern wage setting policy. In
addition to supporting efforts to improve the business climate, enhance productivity, and
privatize public enterprises, the NESP ensures that wage increases are linked to productivity

2
and economic performance in the nonhydrocarbon sector. Furthermore, the trade unions have
indicated that no general wage increase will be requested over the next four years.
The authorities intend to continue to enhance nonhydrocarbon revenue. Building on progress
achieved thus far in improving tax administration, including the establishment of a Large
Taxpayers Unit, the restructuring and modernization of the regional and local tax agencies
are progressing. In addition, the authorities plan to simplify the tax and incentive system and
to modernize customs administration and have requested Fund technical assistance in these
areas. They also intend to gradually increase domestic energy prices while mitigating the
impact on vulnerable segments of the population.
Progress is being made in modernizing budget management and strengthening fiscal
transparency. In this regard, a new budget classification, in line with the Government Finance
Statistics guidelines, has been prepared and a draft organic law will be submitted soon to the
Parliament. The rules governing the use of the hydrocarbon stabilization fund have been
amended to allow for direct financing of the nonhydrocarbon deficit, in line with staff’s
advice. The authorities intend to proceed with implementation of the remaining
recommendations of the 2004 fiscal ROSC, including the introduction of a medium-term
budget framework by 2009.
Prudent monetary policy has kept inflation under control. In view of the potential inflationary
pressures stemming from higher external flows as well as additional spending, the central
bank will continue to absorb excess liquidity in the banking system, while keeping its policy
interest rate positive in real terms. At the same time, it will maintain its flexible exchange
rate policy. In line with staff’s recommendations, the authorities have prepared a draft new
unified regulatory framework to improve the exchange and payments systems, which will be
issued shortly.
Financial sector reforms are advancing, in line with the FSAP recommendations. Banking
supervision continues to be strengthened with Fund technical assistance, mainly through
enhanced on-site inspections. Tighter bank licensing requirements are contributing to
improving the soundness of the sector. With strong political support, the role of the Banking
Commission has been strengthened. Governance of the public banks is being improved, with
close monitoring of the performance contracts and elimination of quasi-fiscal deficits. Efforts
are also focused on improving risk management and internal controls, and plans are being
developed to address the nonperforming loans issue. Competition in the sector will be further
enhanced with the privatization of a first public bank, expected to be completed in early 2007
with the assistance of a reputable foreign investment bank. Significant progress has been
made in modernizing the payment system with the launch in 2006 of the Real Time Gross
Settlement and the Retail Payments systems. The authorities are determined to sustain these
efforts to further strengthen and deepen financial intermediation. The upcoming FSAP update
should contribute to identifying helpful directions in this regard.
The SI paper on growth prospects in Algeria provides useful advice on improving the
country’s growth potential. The paper concludes that “[the] results support the authorities’
reform priorities,” including modernizing the banking and financial system, further

3
liberalizing trade, and improving the business climate. Sustained efforts are being made to
improve governance, prevent corruption, strengthen the judiciary system, and reduce the cost
of doing business. A number of measures have already been taken, including lowering
employers’ social contributions, facilitating the issuance of property titles, and streamlining
the procedures for establishing businesses. Improved financial intermediation, along with
strengthened confidence, should allow raising the quality and the level of credit to the private
sector. The authorities are also advancing the agenda of restructuring and privatization of
public enterprises and have taken important strides in recent years to liberalize trade. They
remain focused on the steadfast implementation of the Association Agreement with the
European Union and making continued progress toward accession to the World Trade
Organization. Ongoing efforts to promote regional cooperation within the Maghreb countries,
including in the areas of trade and finance, should also help improve economic prospects. In
this context, the authorities appreciate highly the Managing Director’s efforts in this process.
