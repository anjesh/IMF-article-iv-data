STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION,
FOURTH REVIEW UNDER THE THREE-YEAR ARRANGEMENT
UNDER THE EXTENDED CREDIT FACILITY, AND FINANCING
ASSURANCES REVIEW
KEY ISSUES
Background: A three-year Extended Credit Facility (ECF) arrangement was approved in
September 2009 for the Union of the Comoros, for the equivalent of SDR 13.57 million
(152.5 percent of quota). The third review was completed on June 15, 2012. Comoros, a
member of the Franc Zone, has accepted the obligations under Article VIII and maintains
an exchange system free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current
international transactions.
Context: In a more enabling political context, Comoros‘ macroeconomic performance
continues to improve. Economic activity is trending up; the external position has
strengthened; and significant gains in fiscal consolidation have been made thanks to
unexpectedly strong revenue collection, including non-tax receipts under the economic
citizenship program, and to enhanced expenditure control.
Medium-term policy framework: The mission: (i) reached understandings with the
authorities on medium-term policies to consolidate recent gains in macroeconomic
stability and to secure further improvements in public utilities management, permitting
Board consideration of the 4th review under the ECF arrangement; (ii) assessed broadly
satisfactory implementation of the HIPC completion triggers, opening the way to full
HIPC/MDRI debt relief and improved debt sustainability prospects.

Moroni during September 22–October 6, 2012. The mission met H.E.
Dr. Dhoinine Ikililou, President of the Union of Comoros. It held
discussions with Vice-President and Finance Minister Soilihi and with
other members of the Cabinet of the Union; with the Governor of the
Central Bank of the Comoros; and with representatives of the private
sector, civil society, and the donor community.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
 In the last 18 months, the Comorian
authorities have made steady progress in
fiscal consolidation, reinvigorated their
structural reform agenda, and gathered
strong public support for sound
macroeconomic policies. This followed a
period where, despite positive political
developments—including bold democracyenhancing constitutional reforms and
peaceful elections followed by a smooth
transition of power—the focus on economic
reform had weakened. The strengthening of
economic policies has greatly bolstered
donor support.
 Macroeconomic developments have
been largely positive, mostly thanks to
improved policies. Despite continued
weaknesses in the global economy, growth
has rebounded modestly and the mediumterm prospects are largely favorable.
However, the authorities concur that
continued growth and sustainable poverty
alleviation will require improvements in
Comoros‘ external competitiveness,
dependent on structural reforms to improve
the efficiency of state-owned public utilities
and the civil service. Following initial
political opposition, the reform agenda in
these areas is now progressing.
 Performance under the ECF-supported
program through end-June 2012 was
satisfactory. All quantitative performance
criteria and indicative targets were met
through end-June, and preliminary data
suggest that all end-September indicative
targets were also observed. Five out of six
structural benchmarks for June and
September were met, and one benchmark
partly observed.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND



External competitiveness improved in
the last year, underpinned by the recent
depreciation of the euro vis-à-vis the US
dollar. As a member of the Franc Zone,
Comoros has limited policy control over the
nominal exchange rate; but continued fiscal
discipline and steadfast implementation of
structural reforms under the ECF would help
to maintain the exchange rate in line with
fundamentals over the medium term.

 In the medium term, the government
intends to seek further gains in fiscal
consolidation and to accelerate reform of
the public enterprises and civil service.
Efforts in raising domestic tax revenue are
to be complemented by enhanced
spending controls—especially on civil sector
personnel outlays. The resulting higher
fiscal space would permit increased
domestically financed investment to
support stronger growth and accelerated
gains in poverty reduction. Comores
Telecom is on track to be privatized in 2013,
in parallel with the introduction of initiatives
to overhaul management of the water and
electricity utility as well as the fuel import
company consistent with reform strategies
agreed with development partners and
adopted in 2012.
 The authorities have observed all but one
HIPC Initiative completion point triggers
and have requested a waiver for the
nonobservance of the latter. Staff supports
this request.
 Staff recommends completion of the
fourth review under the ECF
arrangement.

BACKGROUND: TURNED-AROUND PROGRAM PERFORMANCE IN A
MORE ENABLING POLITICAL CONTEXT

4.
The last Article IV consultation held
in January 2011 concluded that further
efforts were required to achieve tangible
progress in putting the economy on a path
of strong sustained growth, particularly on
structural reforms. Despite the setback in
program performance during 2011, the record
of implementing these recommendations is
now largely positive.

Program performance weakened
substantially in late 2010 and early 2011. From
late 2010, a sizeable public sector pay raise and
lower-than-programmed domestic tax collection
weighed heavily on fiscal developments, and
nearly all programmed structural reform
measures were delayed. As a result, Board
discussion of the third and fourth reviews under
the ECF arrangement, originally planned for 2011,
was delayed.

the Board completed the third ECF review and
approved the extension of the program to end2013.

In September 2009, the IMF Board
approved a three-year ECF arrangement to
support Comoros’ medium-term economic
recovery efforts. The reform agenda promotes
strong sustained growth to achieve deeper gains
in poverty alleviation and faster progress toward
the MDGs. Key policies to strengthen economic
competitiveness are geared to (i) achieving gains
in fiscal consolidation while protecting spending
for the social sectors, and restoring external
viability; (ii) deepening financial intermediation;
(iii) enhancing the efficiency of the public utilities;
(iv) strengthening institutions and improving
governance; and (v) improving the investment
climate.

Performance improved sharply in late
2011 under the reform-minded cabinet that
took office in mid-year. Corrective revenue and
spending measures introduced in the third
quarter—including stepped-up tax arrears
recovery efforts and the reversal of the
prohibitive 2010 public sector wage increase—
helped to steer the program back on track. The
domestic primary budget deficit (excluding oneoff nontax receipts) was limited at 1.4 percent of
GDP; and all wage arrears accumulated in the
earlier months of 2011 were cleared by end-year.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
5.
The political context has continued
to improve and program ownership has
further strengthened during 2012. The
authorities in power since May 2011 have
shown unwavering commitment to IMFsupported policies; and program ownership is
strong not only in government, but also
among trade unions, the private sector, and
wider civil society. There is a broad national
consensus on the need to stay the course for
achieving the HIPC completion point and
continuing satisfactory implementation of the
ECF-supported program over the medium
term.
6.
Macroeconomic performance has
strengthened during 2012 (Table 1 and
Figure 1). Real GDP growth is now projected at
2.5 percent (2.0 percent during 2009–11),
benefiting from strong agricultural exports,
sustained construction activities, robust foreign
aid and direct investment, and resilient
remittances. Despite easing pressures on import
prices, the depreciation of the euro against the
dollar and the temporary impact of rain floods in
April on domestic food prices have slowed the
expected fall in inflation to a projected 5 percent
for end-December (4.3 percent under the
program). Solid exports of cloves and buoyant
receipts of transfers, mainly under the economic
citizenship program (ECP), have supported a
narrowing of the external current account deficit
to 6.9 percent of GDP (estimated 3.5 percent
lower than programmed). 1 International reserves

increased further and are expected to reach the
equivalent of 7.2 months of imports of goods and
services by the end of 2012 (6.7 months at end2011). In the monetary area, persistent excess
liquidity in the banking sector made the reduction
in the reserve ratio ineffective as a tool for
stimulating lending. As a result, a large reduction
of central bank credit to government was only
partially balanced by a modest expansion of bank
credit to the private sector. The fiscal outturn is
expected to be significantly better than
anticipated thanks to buoyant
receipts—particularly non-tax revenues—and
continued restraint on spending, resulting in a
projected domestic primary surplus of 2.2 percent
of GDP, compared to a deficit of 1.1 percent
under the program.

UNION OF THE COMOROS

PROGRAM PERFORMANCE IN 2012
7.
Program performance continued to be
satisfactory (MEFP, Tables 1 and 2). At endJune 2012, all quantitative performance criteria
and indicative targets, as well as structural
benchmarks were met. Revenues exceeded the
program target by 2.7 percent of GDP, reflecting
adequate tax collection and continued strong
non-tax receipts under the ECP. The wage bill
remained within the programmed envelop, but
primary current expenditure was 0.4 percentage
points of GDP higher than programmed due to
emergency spending following massive flood
damages in April; and the domestic primary
budget recorded a surplus of 2.1 percent of GDP
at end-June (a deficit of 0.2 percent under the
program). The performance criterion on net bank
credit to government was observed with a wide
margin, despite budget support falling below
target by 1.1 percent of GDP. Five out of six
structural benchmarks for June and September
were met (MEFP, Table 2). Specifically, the
government finalized a feasibility study on the
establishment of an integrated computerized
public finance management system and
developed a reform strategy for the electricity
parastatal (MA-MWE), with the assistance of
development partners. The September
benchmark for the implementation of newly
approved civil service personnel frameworks has
been delayed to early 2013 due to technical
difficulties incurred by the authorities. In
particular, filling in newly budgeted positions and
matching them up with existing personnel skills at
both Union and island levels have taken longer
than initially anticipated. The authorities are
confident that stepped up technical collaboration
with relevant development partners will allow the
new deadline to be met.

8.
Fiscal performance improved markedly
in 2012 thanks to stronger revenue
mobilization and continued adequate control
of the wage bill. The budget was tightly
managed to ensure that the ECP revenue windfall
would strengthen government savings and be
available for additional outlays on priority
infrastructure and social programs. Revenues are
expected to reach 18.2 percent of GDP
(14 percent of under the program), underpinned
by continued improvement in the mobilization of
direct and indirect taxes and by a sharp increase
in receipts under the ECP. The latter receipts are
projected at 4.5 percent of GDP (including a
windfall of 3.1 percent of GDP), bringing non-tax
revenues to 6.4 percent of GDP (2.2 percent
under the program). With the wage bill
maintained within the programmed envelope, the
authorities have saved six tenths of the ECP
revenue windfall (1.8 percent of GDP), and
allocated the reminder to (i) urgent transport
infrastructure rehabilitation expenditures and
increased government contributions to the
malaria and HIV/AIDS program managed jointly
with the World Health Organization (1 percent of
GDP); and (ii) a short-term loan to the financially
strained national oil importing company to help
secure an adequate supply of imported
petroleum products (0.2 percent of GDP). As a
result, the primary fiscal balance should post a
surplus of 2.2 percent of GDP (a deficit
0.9 percent excluding ECP windfall), and net credit
to the government should contract by 0.8 percent
of GDP as opposed to an expansion of 1 percent
under the program.

The government has completed a
program of capacity building in external debt
management and continued its prudent
external debt management policy. With

support from the AfDB, the debt office received
upgrades in IT hardware, debt management
software, and related training, which are now all
operational.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS AND KEY ISSUES FOR 2013
A. Macroeconomic Outlook and Risks: Safeguarding Macroeconomic
Stability and Strengthening Growth after Debt Relief
10.
In the period ahead, economic
growth is expected to continue trending up
as the fiscal and structural reforms under
the ECF arrangement advance and the
business climate continues to improve (Text
Table 1). Real GDP growth should strengthen
moderately to 3.5 percent in 2013, building on
increased and more reliable availability of
electricity, timely civil service wage payments,
investment in infrastructure, and the start of
production of a new fisheries project. In
addition, economic growth should benefit from
sustained construction activities, robust
domestic demand financed by remittances, and
increased budget support. Inflation will likely
recede further as world fuel and food prices
decline. The external current account deficit is
expected to remain broadly stable while FDI
would continue to grow slowly from its already
high level. In the fiscal area, the medium-term
anchor remains the domestic primary budget,
which is projected to be brought into balance
in 2015. This will help consolidate recent gains
in fiscal sustainability and preserve the
improved debt dynamics in the postHIPC/MDRI era.

11.
Key risks to the outlook for 2013 stem
from Comoros’ dependence on the global
economy, particularly on remittances, aid,
and FDI inflows. Price shocks on key import
commodities, notably oil and food, could also
depress growth and unsettle external and fiscal
balances. Risks of delay to SOE reforms have
receded over the past year, reflecting
strengthened program ownership (see ¶28–31).

UNION OF THE COMOROS

B. Fiscal Policy for 2013
12.
The consolidation of public finances
will continue in 2013 with the deficit of the
domestic primary budget contained at
0.9 percent of GDP (1.2 percent, excluding
ECP windfall, in 2011–12). To this end, the
government is stepping up efforts to increase
domestic revenue, including by improving
further the efficiency of the tax and customs
administrations (¶14, and MEFP ¶9). These
efforts should increase tax revenue to
12.2 percent of GDP (11.8 percent in 2011),
while ECP receipts are expected to return to
their historical average of about 2 percent of
GDP (4 percent in 2011–12). On expenditure,
the government will intensify controls to
contain current spending at 16.3 percent of
GDP (¶14, and MEFP ¶9), with the wage bill
representing 7.6 percent of GDP (8.0 percent in
2012). Spending and the fiscal deficits will
however be ultimately higher in 2013 when the
government allocates part of anticipated
HIPC/MDRI debt relief (2.1 percent of GDP) to
additional poverty reduction outlays under a
revised budget (Text Box 1). External
budgetary support is projected to reach 2 percent of GDP (1 percent under the program) as
donors‘ interest in the country rises.
13.
Should additional donor resources
be forthcoming, the government will
consult with staff on potential uses and
prepare a supplemental budget for their
allocation. Priority will be given to clearing
domestic payment arrears and increasing its
reserves and deposits with central bank.

Text Box 1. Budgeting Received HIPC/MDRI
Debt Relief and Bilateral Assistance Beyond
HIPC
HIPC, MDRI, and bilateral debt relief beyond
HIPC are projected at an annual average of
US$8.89 million (CF3, 142 million or 0.8 percent of GDP) during 2013–31.1 Estimated at
US$15.6 million (2.1 percent of GDP based on
2013 exchange rate), the debt service savings
for 2013 would be confirmed at Paris Club
discussions scheduled for early 2013, and
allocated to additional poverty reduction
outlays and domestic arrears reduction in a
revised budget to be discussed in parliament
next year. The savings for 2014–2017 are
estimated at an average of 1.1 percent of GDP;
they have helped reduce Comoros‘ projected
net fiscal financing needs for the period to an
annual average of 1.5 percent of GDP,
compared with 2.6 percent of GDP before debt
reduction.

consistent with the HIPC methodology (Table A5 of the HIPC
completion point document for Comoros). The amounts in
local currency and in percent of GDP may differ from those
obtained on the basis of projected annual average exchange
rates.

14.
Continued reform of public finance
management will be required to achieve the
government’s fiscal objectives in 2013 and
beyond (MEFP ¶19). In line with
recommendations from past FAD TA missions,
the authorities intend to enhance the
efficiency of tax and customs administrations
notably by: (i) starting operations of the new
General Tax and Property Administration
(AGID) by March 2013, (ii) establishing an
electronic network between the country‘s four
major customs offices by June 2013, and

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

9

UNION OF THE COMOROS

(iii) increasing financial and human resources
of the joint tax-customs investigations brigade.
In addition, the government will continue to
manage rigorously the large taxpayer registry,
and make full use of ad valorem taxation of
imports thanks to a more effective management of the Moroni Port. Efforts to contain
expenditure are focused on gaining full control
of recurrent expenditure—especially for public
wages—and avoiding accumulation of new
payment arrears. In this context, the authorities
will continue to strictly adhere to the new
automated personnel expenditure
management system (GISE) and implement in
January 2013 the new civil service
organizational frameworks with a view to
achieving a more efficient and financially
viable civil service in the medium term. These
frameworks set the optimal size of the civil
service at 11,666 full-time positions. However,
cognizant of the need to preserve the
medium-term sustainability of the wage bill,
the government will initially limit the number
of civil servants to the 10,521 employees
validated under the 2011 census (19 percent
less than the 13,000 reported prior to
verification). Staff and the authorities agreed
that the optimal number of civil servants could
be reached over the medium term, provided
that the wage bill does not exceed the
equivalent of 6 percent of GDP. With the
assistance of the World Bank, the government
is also developing an integrated public finance
information management system aimed at
improving the quality of budget execution,

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

and the monitoring of revenue and
expenditures in all phases of the budget cycle.
The new system is expected to be operational
by end-June 2013 at a cost of US$1.5 million
fully covered by the AfDB.
15.
Within the 2013 fiscal framework
spelled out above, the government’s net
fiscal financing requirements are fully
covered with already-identified budget
support and anticipated use of IMF resources
(Text Table 2). Net bank credit to government
would amount to 1.4 percent, half of which
representing a drawdown of government
deposits with the central bank.

C. Structural and Financial Sector Reforms
16.
The reform of public enterprises is
advancing with the assistance of
development partners (MEFP, ¶46, 47, and
48). In particular, the privatization of Comores
Telecom is proceeding as scheduled. [In late
November 2012, the government issued a call
for bids from potential investors], following
approval in October of a social plan for the
company. The selection of a strategic partner
and the sale of 51 percent of the company‘s
equity are expected in 2013. The government
also plans to open the sector to competition
through the transparent and competitive
issuance of a second mobile license, and to
improve connectivity (Completion Point
Document, [¶20]). With the support of the
World Bank, the government has adopted a
reform strategy for the state-owned oil

remain high. The government has two
priorities for strengthening the financial sector:
(i) the privatization of the Development Bank

process should be completed in 2013; (ii) the
restructuring of the National Post and Financial
Services Institution (SNPSF) is likely to include
the separation of banking activity from the
postal office and foreign direct investment in
the creation of a new fully-fledged commercial
bank in 2013.

D. Program Monitoring and Risks to IMF Resources
19.
The program will be monitored on
the basis of quarterly quantitative targets
and structural benchmarks (MEFP Tables 1
and 2). Program performance criteria have
been set for end-June 2012 and endDecember 2012 for the fourth and fifth ECF
reviews, respectively, at the time of Board
consideration of the third ECF review. No
revisions to performance criteria and indicative
targets are requested; and new targets for the
sixth review are being proposed for end-June
2013. The fifth and sixth ECF reviews are
expected to be completed by June and
December 2013, respectively.
20.
In the structural area, the fifth
program review will focus on reforms to
further strengthen revenue mobilization

and control of wage outlays, and to
improve efficiency of public utilities. These
include the effective operation of the General
Administration of Taxes and implementation of
new ministry personnel frameworks; as well as
the privatization of the state-owned
telecommunications company.
21.
The risks to IMF resources are
manageable. For the rest of the program
(2012–13), debt service to the IMF would
average 0.007 percent of exports of goods and
services while in the medium term (2012–
2023), it would average less than 1.3 percent of
exports of goods and service (Table 8), within
Comoros‘s capacity to repay the IMF.

E. Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper
22.
The second annual progress report
(APR), completed in October 2012, assesses
moderately positive performance in
implementing the Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper (PRSP) in 2011. Particularly
noteworthy are achievements in maintaining
macroeconomic stability, rekindling the reform
of the public utilities, and securing
improvements in health and human capital
indicators. However, poverty remains

widespread—particularly in rural areas—and
local technical capacity constraints are
important obstacles to effective
implementation of the reform agenda. The
APR also shows that there remain major
challenges to implementing the PRS, including
weaknesses in data collection and statistics. In
addition, the growth prospects continue to be
hampered by energy shortages and
infrastructure bottlenecks (JSAN, ¶13–14).

HIPC INITIATIVE COMPLETION POINT AND FINANCING
ASSURANCES REVIEW
23.
Comoros has broadly met the
conditions for reaching the HIPC Initiative
completion point. With assistance from
development partners, the authorities have
implemented all but one of the HIPC Initiative
completion point triggers (Completion Point
Document), including broadly satisfactory
implementation of the poverty reduction
strategy in the last two years; achievement of
gains in fiscal consolidation and
macroeconomic stability; progress in
improving public financial and debt
management; and advances in restructuring
the public utilities. The authorities have also
developed new institutional frameworks aimed
at achieving improved outcomes in
procurement and governance, and in better
tackling corruption. In the education and
health sectors, new schools have been built
and required vaccination campaigns
undertaken. The authorities have requested a
waiver for the nonobservance of the
completion point trigger on the distribution of
school books, in part due to a change in
strategy on education, as recommended by
relevant donors (Completion Point Document,
¶27).
24.
The authorities have concluded debt
restructuring agreements with their main
bilateral and multilateral creditors,
consistent with the November 2009 Paris
Club Agreement and the HIPC Initiative

framework. They are negotiating with
remaining multilateral and official bilateral
creditors and making good faith efforts to
reach collaborative agreements with private
creditors (completion point document, ¶42).
25.
An updated low-income country
debt sustainability analysis (LIC-DSA)
indicates that Comoros would face a high
risk of debt distress post HIPC/MDRI. The
country had been in debt distress prior to
reaching the HIPC Initiative completion point,
but would likely not experience debt
repayment difficulties after receiving full HIPC,
MDRI, and beyond-HIPC debt relief. However,
the debt-to-exports ratio reveals a protracted
breach of the relevant threshold under the
baseline, and the external debt dynamics
would remain vulnerable to shocks over the
long term. While remittances are an important
source of foreign exchange, they have a
limited impact on growth and affect the
external debt outlook only moderately.
(Completion point Document, Appendix II). In
light of Comoros‘ narrow export base and high
vulnerability to exogenous shocks it is critical
that the government‘s fiscal financing needs
continue to be met mostly with grants, and
that new borrowing is contracted on
concessional terms for the foreseeable future.

Comoros’ external position improved
markedly in 2012 despite persistent trade
imbalances (Text Figure 3). The current
account deficit is projected to decline to

6.9 percent of GDP (9.0 percent in 2011),

27.
The Comorian franc is broadly in line
with its medium-term fundamentals (Box 1).
Comoros‘ real effective exchange rate
depreciated by about 13 percent between
October 2009 and September 2012, mainly
reflecting the weakening of the euro vis à vis
the US dollar. Over the medium term, results
based on standard CGER-like methodologies
indicate that Comoros‘ exchange rate is subject
to overvaluation pressures, but would remain
broadly consistent with external sustainability
provided that the authorities maintain fiscal
discipline and continue pressing ahead with
structural reforms to improve competitiveness.
In this regard, despite recent progress,
Comoros‘ structural indicators suggest that the
overall quality of the business environment
remains poor, with the country scoring below
peers in areas such as the ease of doing
business, government effectiveness, and quality
of regulation (Text Table 4 and Box 2). Staff
urged the authorities to adhere closely to the
polices set out in the ECF arrangement;
continue making progress in promoting the
development of sectors with high growth
potential, such as agriculture, fishing, and
tourism; and further improve the business
environment to attract foreign investors and
promote private sector development. The
authorities concurred with staff‘s assessment of
the exchange rate and reiterated their
adherence to the exchange rate peg under the
Franc Zone arrangement, which they view as an
appropriate anchor for external stability and
low inflation.

Thanks to strong remittances and aid
inflows, Comoros’ international reserves
remain at an adequate level for
precautionary purposes. In 2012, reserve
holdings are expected to increase to
7.2 months of imports, equivalent to 32 percent
of GDP and 90 percent of broad money. Over
the medium term, reserve accumulation would
remain adequate as indicated by a modelbased approach to reserve adequacy in LICs,
which explicitly takes into account Comoros‘
structural characteristics—including its
vulnerability to external shocks—and different
costs of holding reserves (Text Figure 2).3 The
authorities concurred with staff‘s analysis and
reiterated their commitment to prudent reserve
management, consistent with relevant Zone
Franc regulations, to support the peg with the
euro.
29.
A small open economy, Comoros is
particularly vulnerable to external shocks;
and delays in programmed public enterprise
and financial sector reforms would
significantly affect medium-term prospects.
The mission discussed the (i) potential impact
of external shocks transmitted through
remittances, FDI, trade, and aid with a focus on
vulnerability to disruptions in aid and FDI
receipts (Box 2); and (ii) potential fall-out from
a domestic policy shock that would delay
public enterprise and banking sector reforms.
30.
Achieving strong sustained growth
requires steady efforts to alleviate Comoros’
vulnerability to import price shocks, and to
develop a diversified goods and service
exports base. Fuel imports, the bulk of which
for electrical power generation, exceed 10 percent of GDP. The authorities concurred that

enhancing the flexibility of domestic fuel
pricing policies and reforming MA-MWE and
SCH are essential to shielding the budget from
adverse global fuel price developments. In
contrast, goods exports account for only
4 percent of GDP. The authorities stressed their
commitment to export diversification, pointing
to fishing and tourism projects that are
underway. They recognized that the long-term
success of their export development strategy
hinges on a further strengthening of economic
competitiveness more generally, which requires
continued adherence to stability-oriented fiscal
policies and to increased investments in
infrastructure and education.
31.
The authorities broadly agreed that a
suspension of SOE reform would negatively
affect overall program performance, curtail
anticipated aid flows, and delay much
needed gains in overall economic
competitiveness. They concurred that such
developments would frustrate achievement of
the government‘s medium-term growth and
poverty alleviation objectives. However, the
authorities felt that the likelihood of this
downside scenario materializing was low since
they were fully committed to the SOE reform
and were indeed carrying it forward. The
authorities reiterated their commitment to
fiscal discipline and to continued progress in
implementing their structural reform agenda,
as a means of building fiscal buffers and
enhancing investor and donor interest in
Comoros.
32.
Although the banking sector remains
sound, it may lack the dynamism to support
Comoros’ growth ambitions more
effectively. Recent years have seen the arrival
of two new commercial banks and a significant
increase in both the geographic coverage of
financial services and the volume of savings
mobilization. As a result, financial
intermediation has expanded and competition

in the banking industry increased. However, the
persistent excess bank liquidity, high interest
spreads between deposit and lending rates,
and still high NPL ratios point to institutional
bottlenecks that still have to be addressed.
These include an outdated regulatory
framework, the absence of a credit bureau, and
weaknesses in the legal system that make
enforcement of rulings against loan defaulters
costly and slow.

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

33.
The authorities concurred with
staff’s assessment of the banking system’s
soundness and urgent need for
modernization. They noted BCC‘s recently
bolstered banking supervision capacity and
other important policy actions under way to
strengthen the central bank‘s ability to support
the development of the financial sector (¶18).

UNION OF THE COMOROS

Box 1. Comoros’ Exchange Rate and Competitiveness Assessment
An updated assessment of the real effective exchange rate (REER) indicates that the Comorian franc is broadly in line with its
medium-term fundamentals. However, non-price indicators suggest that the country’s external competitiveness continues to
be undermined by the weak overall quality of the business environment—particularly in the areas of ease
of doing business, government effectiveness, and quality of regulation. These results are subject to considerable uncertainty
due to the difficulties of assessing the exchange rate with standard analytical methodologies in developing countries and the
1,2
volatility of economic variables—especially in small islands.
Standard exchange rate assessment methods

3

The Macroeconomic Balance approach points to an
11 percent overvaluation of the REER with respect to its
medium-term fundamentals. These include economic growth,
fiscal balance, income, net foreign assets position, aid,
remittances, and demographics.
The External Sustainability approach suggests an
overvaluation of the Comorian franc of 22.5 percent, if the
country‘s net foreign asset position was to be maintained at its
2011 level (12 percent of GDP). The estimated overvaluation
increases if a lower net foreign position-to-GDP ratio is
targeted over the medium term.
The Equilibrium Real Exchange Rate and the Purchasing
Power Parity approaches indicate that the currency is
undervalued with respect to its long-run equilibrium level in the
range of 2.6–6.6 percent, which falls within the margin of errors
of these methods.

Export market shares
(In percent)

Non-price indicators
Comoros’ export performance has been lackluster compared
to other CFA countries, leading to a marked decline of the
country‘s share in world export and contributing to a significant
widening of the trade balance deficit. Over the medium term,
exports are expected to pick up, reflecting important
investment in the service sector and efforts to broaden the
export base.
The overall quality of the business environment remains poor,
despite recent progress. The 2013 Doing Business Indicators
report ranks Comoros 158 out of 185 countries (also 158 in
2012), underscoring the need for further improvement—
particularly with respect to the ease of starting a business,
enforcing contracts, and resolving solvency. In addition, structural
governance remains weak—including in the areas of government
effectiveness and quality of regulation—as indicated by the 2012
Governance Indicators from the World Bank.

Box 2. Interconnectedness and Spillovers: Assessing Comoros’ Vulnerability to Global
Shocks
Comoros can be affected by changes in global conditions
through four main channels: remittances, foreign aid, FDI,
and exports. For 2012–13, these sources of foreign exchange
average an estimated 35 percent of GDP. To assess the
potential impact of global shocks on Comoros, staff
simulated the impact of two adverse scenarios based on
1
WEO projections by using the GIMF model.
The baseline scenario is based on global medium term
(2013-17) growth of 4.1 percent and falling commodity
prices (including fuel). Two alternative scenarios are
considered: (i) a scenario assuming a 3-percentage-point
fall in growth in 2013 (from 3.5 percent in 2012), followed
by a gradual recovery of real GDP growth to an average
2
4.1 percent in the medium term (Figure 1); and (ii) a
protracted growth decline scenario consisting of an
average 15-percent fall (-0.59 percentage point) in
growth between 2013 and 2014, followed by a steep
recovery to an average real GDP growth of 3.2 percent in
3
the medium term (Figure 2).
Changes in global conditions would affect aggregate
demand through three main channels:



Remittances, mostly from France, have averaged
25 percent of GDP in 2009–11 and have been resilient
throughout the recent crisis. They are important for
financing imports (49 percent of GDP in 2009–11). A
further slowdown in the Euro Zone could depress the
level of remittances and household consumption
could suffer severely, although remittances have so
far been quite resilient in the face of the global
slowdown.

__________________________________________
1
The GIMF model is a tool for analyzing the interaction among
macroeconomic policies of the world economy. It is a dynamic
general equilibrium model (Kumhof, Michael, Douglas Laxton,
Dirk Muir, and Susana Mursula, 2010, ―The Global Integrated
Monetary and Fiscal Model (GIMF) – Theoretical Structure,‖ IMF
Working Paper No. 10/34).
2

In this scenario, the euro area sovereign and banking stress
intensifies and spills over to other regions. The scenario assumes
that credit in both core and periphery euro zone countries
contracts significantly for two years. Sovereign risk premiums rise
by 300 bps for core countries and 500 bps for periphery countries
by 2014; fiscal policies are further tightened, and risk spills over to
all other regions.
3

In this scenario, potential output in advanced and emerging
markets is lower than assumed in the baseline. In advanced
economies hysteresis in unemployment, slower technological
advancement, and/or more cautious behavior of households and
firms drive the long-run reduction in activity. The slower growth
in advanced economies implies more subdued external prospects
for emerging economies.

18 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND



Foreign aid (about 8–10 percent of GDP) could be
susceptible to continued austerity policies in donor
countries, particularly in Europe. Lower budget and
project grants would have a relatively important
impact on growth. However, these risks would be
mitigated by potentially stronger resource flows from
multilateral donors and partner countries from the
Gulf region if program performance remains
satisfactory.



FDI flows in Comoros have accelerated recently (to
about 5 percent of GDP). They are predominantly
originating from the Gulf region. Staff analysis
suggests that adverse developments in the Gulf
region could put future and existing projects at risk,
with far reaching implications for economic activity in
Comoros.



Exports (4 percent of GDP) are dominated by cloves
and vanilla. World price fluctuations would affect
export earnings, but with contained repercussions on
the wider economy.

With only 10 percent of remittances allocated to
productive activities, the direct growth effect of lower
inflows is somewhat small, and a very high propensity to
import and a narrow domestic production base make the
indirect (multiplier) effect even less significant. Staffs
estimate the growth elasticity of remittances at around
0.15 in remitting countries as compared to 1.5 found in
4
literature. As for FDI receipts and foreign aid, their
growth elasticities in source regions are set at 21 and 0.1,
5
respectively. The impact of the downside scenario and
the protracted growth decline scenario are presented in
Figure 3 and Figure 4, respectively.
Under either scenario, Comoros has limited buffers to
absorb the negative effects of external shocks. A
tightening of fiscal policy could be necessary, should a
reduction in budget support and FDI materializes.
Continued fiscal prudence and timely implementation of
the structural agenda remain critical.

V. STAFF APPRAISAL
34.
Staff takes note of progress the
authorities have made in the last 12 months
in implementing reforms under the ECF
arrangement. The main achievements include
a return to medium-term viability for the wage
bill and rekindling of the structural reform
agenda. Furthermore, the authorities have
successfully concluded debt rescheduling
negotiations with their main creditors and
broadly met the requirements for reaching the
HIPC Initiative completion point.
35.
Preserving macroeconomic stability
remains a key medium-term objective for
the government. This requires sustained
efforts to strengthen revenue mobilization and
keep spending at levels compatible with
medium-term fiscal sustainability. Staff urges
the timely establishment of the new General
Administration of Taxes and implementation of
parliament-approved new ministry personnel
frameworks, as well as the continued rigorous
adherence to the new automated personnel
expenditure management system (GISE); all of
which are essential to ensuring that the fiscal
program stays on track.
36.
The authorities concur about the
need for continued close collaboration with
development partners in the reform of SOEs
and in the effort to improve the business
environment. In the coming year, they intend
to focus on enlisting strategic partners of
international repute in the management of the
telecommunication (Comores Telecom) and
electricity (MA-MWE) parastatals; and on
strengthening management of the oil-

importing company (SCH). With IFC technical
assistance, the authorities are also streamlining
the administrative requirements to starting a
company, and developing reliable contractenforcement mechanisms for the private
sector. Continuing rigorous implementation
will be critically important in the period ahead.
37.
The main risks to the program
remain resistance to civil service and public
enterprise reforms, although these risks
have receded over the last year. The
prospects for higher aid, FDI and remittances
could be undermined by a further weakening
of the global economy, especially if the Gulf
region, an important source of FDI and aid for
Comoros, were affected. To mitigate the risks
to the economic outlook, staff urges continued
close adherence to the ECF-supported reform
agenda and stepped-up efforts to enhance
public support for reforms, including through
stronger actions to improve governance and
accountability in public resources
management and the deployment of a welltargeted communication strategy.
38.
Staff recommends the completion of
the fourth review under the ECF
arrangement and financing assurances
review, disbursement of related ECF
resources, as well as the conclusion of the
2012 Article IV consultation.
39.
It is proposed that the next Article
IV consultation with the Union of Comoros
take place within 24 months subject to the
provisions of the decision on consultation
cycles in program countries.

APPENDIX 1—LETTER OF INTENT
Moroni, November 30, 2012
Madame Christine Lagarde
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431

Dear Ms. Lagarde,
1.
After decades of instability, the Union of the Comoros is entering a new era of peace,
political calm, and renewed efforts to combat poverty. In this new context, the government
intends to pursue with increased rigor the program of economic and social reforms supported by
the IMF under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF). The main program measures are based on the
national Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) adopted in 2009; its key objectives remain the
expansion of fiscal space to permit increased spending on priority sectors and support growth,
and increased competitiveness of the economy to promote strong, inclusive growth.
2.
As expressed in our discussions with Fund staff for the fourth review of the ECFsupported program, we report that all relevant performance criteria, including the quantitative
targets for the period ending June 30, 2012, were met. In particular, solid revenue collection and
rigorous monitoring of expenditures helped to maintain net credit to the government within
program limits; and the accumulation of new payment arrears was avoided thanks to stricter
monitoring of treasury operations. Implementation of the structural program component was
also satisfactory, with the timely adoption of measures programmed for the above deadline:
Parliament‘s adoption of the law creating the General Tax Administration and the establishment
of the new list of government personnel to implement the recommendations of the recent civil
service census.
3.
The government is determined to stay the course with the fiscal consolidation and
structural reform efforts under way in order to strengthen fiscal and macroeconomic
sustainability and restore lasting growth. To this end, it will ensure that its revenue targets are
met and maintain the wage bill within limits compatible with its capacity to mobilize domestic
revenue. Cognizant of the need to strengthen economic competitiveness, the government plans
to step up implementation of its structural reform program, particularly the restructuring of
public enterprises. In view of the satisfactory performance and favorable outlook for the
program, the government requests the completion of the fourth review under the ECF
arrangement and the disbursement of related ECF resources. Furthermore, confident that it has
successfully executed all except one of the triggers for the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries
(HIPC) Initiative completion point, for which a waiver is being requested, the government
requests access for Union of the Comoros to the debt relief benefits under the HIPC Initiative and
the Multilateral Debt Reduction Initiative (MDRI).

4.
Macroeconomic developments were generally favorable in 2012. The rate of real GDP
growth is projected at 2.5 percent, supported by construction and private consumption sustained
by transfers from the Diaspora, and by financial support and investments by foreign public and
private partners. Inflation has declined moderately, reflecting a relatively less difficult
international context than in 2011, despite the flooding that had affected food crop production
in the second quarter. The current account deficit is expected to decline significantly, primarily
due to a strong rebound in current public and private transfers. The improvements in the public
financial position begun in 2011 continued, and the domestic primary budget balance is
expected to post a surplus of 2.2 percent of GDP, reflecting the impact of increased efforts to
mobilize domestic resources, exceptionally high receipts from the economic citizenship program,
and renewed control of the wage bill.
5.
The architecture and basic objectives of the ECF-supported program remain unchanged.
As indicated in the accompanying memorandum of economic and financial policies, the
government will continue to conduct a prudent fiscal policy with support from the IMF, ensuring
the preservation of resources allocated to social sectors in support of its efforts to combat
poverty. The government also intends to expedite the structural reforms needed to strengthen
the competitiveness of the Comorian economy. The Government believes that the policies set
forth in this letter and the MEFP are adequate to achieve the objectives of its program, but will
take any further measures that may become appropriate for this purpose. We will consult with
the Fund on the adoption of these measures and in advance of any revision to the policies
contained in the MEFP, in accordance with the Fund‘s policies on such consultation. We intend to
remain in close consultation with Fund staff and provide timely information necessary for
monitoring economic developments and implementation of policies under the ECF arrangement.
It is expected that the fifth review of the ECF arrangement will take place on or after March 15,
2013, and that the sixth review will be completed on or after September 2013.
6.
In line with our commitment to transparency in government operations, we agree to the
publication of documents relating to our discussions with Fund staff under the fourth review of
our ECF-supported program.

ATTACHMENT 1: MEMORANDUM OF ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL POLICIES FOR 2013

I.

INTRODUCTION

1.
This memorandum takes stock of progress made in 2011–12 in implementing the
reforms supported by the International Monetary Fund under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF),
and sets out the measures and policies that the government plans to implement in 2013 in order
to achieve its objectives.

II.

ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND PROGRAM PERFORMANCE

A. Recent economic developments and program implementation
2.
Economic activity is gradually gaining momentum. According to projections, real GDP
growth should rise modestly to 2.5 percent in 2012, buoyed by sustained activity in the
construction and public works sector, a reasonably good harvest of cash crops, the resilience of
remittances from expatriate workers, increased external financial support, and a modest return of
foreign direct investment (FDI). Inflation is projected at 5 percent year-on-year, reflecting the
euro‘s depreciation vis-à-vis the dollar and the impact of the April 2012 floods on the supply of
locally produced foodstuffs. Inflation would nonetheless be lower than last year (7 percent),
contained by reduced pressure on international prices of key imports.
3.
The fiscal position improved considerably in 2012, reflecting satisfactory revenue
mobilization and more effective control of spending, particularly the wage bill. Revenue is
expected to exceed the targeted 14 percent of GDP and reach 18.2 percent of GDP thanks to
increased collection of direct and indirect taxes and a marked increase in revenue from the
economic citizenship program; the latter will increase to 4.5 percent of GDP in 2012 compared
with a target of 1.4percent of GDP under the program, or a gain equivalent to 3.1 percent of
GDP. The government has decided to save the bulk of the windfall (1.8 percent of GDP), and to
allocate the remainder to urgent expenditures to rehabilitate infrastructure, primarily roads, and
to spending on the malaria and HIV/AIDS program managed jointly with the World Health
Organization (WHO, 1 percent of GDP); as well as to a short-term loan to the financially strained
national oil importing company to help secure an adequate supply of imported petroleum
products (0.2 percent of GDP). Under these circumstances, with the wage bill maintained within
the programmed envelope, (i) the primary fiscal balance is expected to record a surplus of
2.2 percent of GDP (1.6 percent in 2011), and (ii) net bank financing to the government is
expected to decline by 0.8 percent of GDP as against an expansion of 1 percent of GDP projected
under the program.
4.
The current account deficit is expected to narrow significantly in 2012. According to
projections, the external current account deficit is expected to fall to 6.9 percent of GDP
(9 percent in 2011), reflecting the relatively strong performance of clove exports and sharp rise in
public and private transfers, despite the increase in imports financed by external assistance and
resulting from the rebound of FDI, including fuel imports. International reserves are expected to

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 35

UNION OF THE COMOROS

increase to the equivalent of at least seven months of non-factor goods and services imports by
end-2012.
5.
Determined to reduce external debt to a sustainable level, the government has
implemented the triggers for reaching the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC)
Initiative and expect to obtain substantial debt relief under the HIPC and Multilateral Debt
Reduction (MDRI) initiatives. As a result, the net present value of external debt should be
reduced to the equivalent of 78.9 percent of goods and services exports at end-December 2012
from 233.8 in 2011, representing a reduction of 64.3 percent.
B. Program implementation
6.
Implementation of the ECF-supported program was satisfactory in 2012 (Tables 1 and
2). All quantitative performance criteria and indicative targets, as were the structural benchmarks,
for end-June were met. Revenue exceeded the programmed target by 2.7 percent of GDP
(9.7 percent against 7 percent), the result of solid tax collection and continued high levels of nontax
receipts from the economic citizenship program. The wage bill remained within the established
target, but current primary expenditures were higher than planned due to emergency purchases of
goods and services for victims of the flooding caused by heavy rainfall in April and to the
rehabilitation of roads and some sports infrastructures pursuant to longstanding sub-regional
commitments. The primary domestic budget posted a surplus equivalent to 2.1 percent of GDP,
while the program provided for a deficit of 0.2 percent, and the performance criteria relating to net
bank credit to the government was observed with a large margin, despite budgetary support falling
short of the program objective by roughly 1 percent of GDP. The solid performance in the fiscal area
continued in the third quarter. On the structural front, five of the six program benchmarks for endJune and end-September were observed. In particular, Parliament adopted the law creating the new
tax and property administration and providing for improved functional integration; and the
government prepared a new list of government employees conforming to the results of the civil
service census – an indispensable measure for improved control of the wage bill. In addition, the
strategy to reform the water and electricity utility (MA-MWE) was adopted. However,
implementation of the new civil service organizational frameworks (cadres organiques, ministry
staffing allocations), initially planned for end-September, is not expected to begin until January
2013 following long technical delays for various upstream actions, including filling in of newly
budgeted positions by the regional entities.

III.

ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL POLICIES FOR 2013
A. Macroeconomic Framework

7.
Real GDP growth is projected to rise to 3.5 percent in 2013, with lower inflation
reflecting the continued easing of pressure on international fuel and food prices. Growth
will continue to be driven primarily by activity in foodcrop agriculture thanks to satisfactory
rainfall, and by continuing recovery of the construction and public works sector, which is
expected to benefit from increased foreign aid, remittances from the Diaspora, and renewed FDI,

36

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UNION OF THE COMOROS

including in the hotel industry. Year-on-year inflation is expected to recede to around
3.6 percent. In the external sector, the current account deficit is expected to be contained at
7.3 percent of GDP.
B. Fiscal Policy
8.
In 2013, the government is committed to rigorous execution of its fiscal policy
supported by the IMF under the ECF. The domestic primary fiscal deficit (excluding exceptional
economic citizenship receipts) should be contained at the equivalent of 0.9 percent of GDP
(1.2 percent in 2011/12). To this end, the government will step up efforts to mobilize revenue by
increasing the efficiency of the tax and customs administrations. If external budgetary support
exceeds the programmed amounts, the government will consult Fund staff regarding utilization
of the windfall and will prepare a supplemental budget providing for allocation of the resources.
In that context, the government will accord priority to clearing domestic payment arrears and
increasing its reserves and deposits with the BCC.
9.
Domestic revenue is expected to increase to the equivalent of 14.5 percent of GDP
in 2013 and expenditures to remain within 25 percent of GDP, with the wage bill
representing 7.6 percent of GDP. Efforts to mobilize revenue will rely chiefly on continuation of
the reforms to increase efficiency in the tax and customs authorities as described in paragraph
19 below. Control of spending, particularly wages, will also be intensified (paragraphs 19b and
20). The budget contribution to investment expenditures will be increased to 2.1 percent of GDP
(1.5 percent of GDP in 2011-2012), and spending for the social sectors of education and health
will be increased to CF 13.908 billion (CF 13.034 billion in 2012). The government will continue to
strengthen cash flow monitoring to prevent any new accumulation of domestic payment arrears
and ensure regular, timely payment of monthly wages to government employees.
10.
The overall fiscal position (cash basis, including grants) is projected to be nearly in
balance in 2013. The government‘s net financing needs will be covered entirely by financial
support from partners in the Gulf region, the IMF, the African Development Bank (AfDB), and the
World Bank. If revenue or grants fall below programmed amounts, the government will take
appropriate offsetting measures including reduced spending for goods and services
consumption and equipment purchases and more vigorous collection of tax arrears.
C. Money, Credit, and the Financial System
11.
Monetary policy will remain prudent. It will aim to preserve the stability of prices and
the macroeconomic framework while ensuring adequate supply of liquidity to the economy. In
this context, the required reserves ratio was reduced to 20 percent in 2012. The rapid expansion
of broad money in recent years is expected to stabilize, and credit to the private sector should
increase to 11 percent in 2013. After strengthening its bank supervision department, the BCC
intends to expedite the implementation of a credit information repository (centrale des risques)
to promote the sound development of credit in the context of expanded financial intermediation

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

37

UNION OF THE COMOROS

in the Comoros. The BCC will also continue to implement the recommendations of the 2010
safeguards assessment, including the mandated routine and timely publication of its financial
statements in accordance with applicable international standards. Publication of the 2011 BCC
audited financial statement has been delayed, but will take place by end-December 2012.
12.
Financial strengthening of the banking system remains a priority. The majority of
financial institutions saw improved profitability and a decline in the large proportion of
nonperforming loans in their portfolios in 2012. The BCC is supporting these improvements and
intends to push them further in the coming years by ensuring that the country‘s banks and
financial institutions adhere strictly to prudential standards. The reform of the banking system
will focus on privatizing the Comoros Development Bank (BDC) and restructuring the National
Postal and Financial Services Company (SNPSF), including separation of the banking and postal
functions and the sale of a substantial stake to a new foreign partner. The details of this key
reform are in preparation and expected to be available by end-March 2013. The BCC, under the
government‘s direction, expects to ensure prompt implementation in due course.
D. Balance of Payments and External Debt
13.
The external current account deficit, including grants and private and official
transfers, is expected to narrow to further to 6 percent of GDP in 2013 (6.9 percent of GDP
in 2012). This notably reflects a pickup in tourism services and the impact of received
HIPC/MDRI debt relief, despite a decline in current public transfers after a sharp increase in 2012.
In a context of improved terms of trade, the trade balance should not decline significantly, and
according to projections, international reserves will represent the equivalent of 7.7 months of
goods and services imports in 2013.
14.
In the past two years the government successfully executed the triggers for the
HIPC Initiative completion point. This will help the Union of the Comoros achieve not only
debt relief under the HIPC Initiative but also substantial debt reductions under the MDRI. The net
present value of the external debt to export ratio is expected to decline to 78.9 percent of GDP
by end-December 2012. The union of the Comoros appreciates the debt reduction accorded by
its creditors, which will enable it to devote additional resources to support its development
efforts.
15.
To preserve the renewed sustainability of our external debt, the government will
continue pursuing a prudent budget policy and develop a comprehensive new debt
strategy. In this context, the government will ensure that its financing needs are largely covered
by grants, and will contract debt only under concessional terms. As in the past, any external debt
contracted or guaranteed by the government will be subject to the prior approval of the Ministry
of Finance of the Union, and the islands governments will not be authorized to a contract or
guarantee external loans. Furthermore, the government will not contract or guarantee short-term
external or nonconcessional debt as defined in the Technical Memorandum of Understanding
(TMU). The authorities will continue to consult Fund staff before contracting or guaranteeing any
concessional external debt in excess of US$20 million.

38

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UNION OF THE COMOROS

E. Structural Policies
16.
With assistance from the development partners, the government relaunched the
reform of public enterprises. The reform focuses on privatization of Comores Télécom with
support from the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and restructuring of the public
electricity utility (MA-MWE) and oil importer and distributor Société Comorienne des
Hydrocarbures (SCH) with technical assistance from the World Bank, the AfDB, and the
European Union. The government recently completed the reform strategies for the three
enterprises and plans to quickly proceed with implementation.
17.
The restructuring of Comores Télécom will include the sale of 51 percent of
shareholding to a strategic partner of international repute. To this end, the government
issued a call for expressions of interest in late November 2012, preceded by the adoption of a
social plan for the company in October. The government will ensure that the new partner is
effectively involved in company management before end-June 2013.
18.
The government is determined to take vigorous measures to substantially improve
the management of MA-MWE and SCH. It has issued a call for expressions of interest to recruit
a specialized partner in charge of invigorating MA-MWE‘s commercial operations. The collection
rate for electricity consumption bills is extremely low in the Comoros, estimated at 30 percent. In
addition to a flexible, cost-based, pricing policy, a substantial improvement in the rate of
collections from the company‘s customers is a key prerequisite to a sustainable turnaround of its
operations and financial position. With assistance from the World Bank, the government expects
to make significant progress in these areas in the coming months. In the context of the energy
sector strategy adopted in August 2012, the government plans to revitalize SCH through a series
of actions supported by the World Bank and other partners. The most important initiatives
concern: (i) the development of appropriate price structures for the various petroleum products
sold and a better alignment of domestic petroleum products prices to relevant parameters
entailing enhanced pricing flexibility, (ii) improved supervision of financial management and
governance, and (ii) the development of an investment program designed to increase the
capacity and improve the security of storage facilities.
19.
Reforms in the area of public finance aim to enhance the efficiency of tax and
customs administrations and improve control of the wage bill.
a. The tax and customs administrations will function more effectively following:
(i) the start of operations of the new General Tax and Property Administration (AGID)
in March 2013, (ii) the establishment of an electronic network between the country‘s
four major customs offices by June 30, 2013 (a new structural benchmark), and
(iii) increased financial and human resources for the joint tax-customs investigations
brigade. The government will also continue to rigorously manage the large taxpayer
registry and make full use of ad valorem taxation of imports in the context of a more
effective management of the Moroni Port.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

39

UNION OF THE COMOROS

b. To better control the wage bill in the medium term, the government will continue
to adhere strictly to the new automated personnel expenditure management system
(GISE). In the near term, the government intends to limit the number of civil servants
to the 10,521 employees validated under the 2011 census, a 19 percent reduction
from the 13,000 reported prior to verification. It will implement the delayed new civil
service organizational frameworks approved by the Parliament, beginning in January
2013. Those frameworks make room for 11,666 budgeted positions, representing the
optimum size of the civil service. However, cognizant of the need to preserve the
medium-term sustainability of the wage bill, the government will phase in the
increase gradually, subject to the condition that the wage bill not exceeds the
equivalent of 6 percent of GDP.
20.
The government has begun development of an ambitious integrated public
financial management system. It recently completed the system feasibility study with support
from the World Bank. The system‘s deployment is expected to improve monitoring of
government revenue and expenditures in all phases of the budget cycle and substantially
improve the quality of budget execution. The new system is expected to be online before endJune 2013, at a cost of US$1.5 million fully covered by the AfDB.
21.
By end-June 2013, the government will complete a new strategy to improve public
financial management for the period 2014–2017 (a new structural benchmark). The document
will assess progress made in this area in recent years and define the new reform measures
needed to consolidate the gains and establish new bases for more sound management of
government finance in the context of a second three-year reform program supported by the IMF
under the ECF.
F. Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) and Improvement of
Economic and Social Statistics
22.
The second annual progress report on PRSP implementation, completed in October
2012, reviews activities completed in 2011. It reveal the establishment of some road
infrastructures, a modest recovery in the tourism and fishing sectors, and progress with respect
to growth, macroeconomic stability, institutional development, and political governance. At the
same time, the report notes persistent shortcomings in implementing the poverty reduction
strategy and weak capacity to absorb available resources, which limit tangible gains in the social
sectors. The lack of updated data on poverty remains a major constraint. The government
intends to improve the effectiveness of its poverty reduction strategy by making use of the
report‘s conclusions and recommendations. In this context, it also plans to organize a national
symposium on the promotion of the most productive sectors of the economy in order to identify
policies and actions to remove constraints on the development of these sectors with strong
growth potential. The government has also begun preparations for the third annual progress
report on PRSP implementation, which is expected to be finalized in June 2013.

40

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UNION OF THE COMOROS

23.
The government will continue its efforts to improve the socio-demographic and
macroeconomic databases needed for effective design and monitoring of its development
policy. It will continue to receive substantial technical assistance from the AfDB in this context,
including in the preparation of the national accounts and consumer price index. The program to
improve the quality of national accounts and consumer price statistics is expected to be
completed in 2013. With support from the European Union, the government is implementing a
program to strengthen the reform monitoring unit (CREF) capacities in the area of gathering,
compiling, verifying, processing, and consolidating economic and financial data and preparing
the table of government financial operations (TOFE).

IV.

MONITORING OF PROGRAM EXECUTION AND REPHASING OF DISBURSEMENTS

24.
The program monitoring will be based on quarterly targets with performance
criteria established on a semiannual basis (Tables 1 and 2). The government will transmit
information required for program monitoring to the IMF in accordance with the TMU. During the
program period, it will refrain from instituting or increasing restrictions on payments or transfers
for current international transactions, and will not introduce or modify any multiple currency
practices, conclude any bilateral payment agreements that are inconsistent with Article VIII of the
IMF Articles of Agreement, or impose any restrictions on imports for balance of payments
purposes.
25.
The fifth review of the ECF-supported arrangement will be conducted in June 2013.
In the area of structural reforms, the review will focus primarily on measures to improve budget
management and implementation of reforms of public enterprises, including: (i) implementation
of the civil service organizational frameworks; (ii) development of the new integrated public
financial management system; (iii) establishment of the new AGID; and (iv) restructuring of
Comores Télécom, MA-MWE, and SCH.

ATTACHMENT 2: TECHNICAL MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
Moroni, November 30, 2012

1.
This Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU) defines the quantitative performance
criteria, indicative targets, and structural benchmarks to be used to monitor implementation of the
program supported by the three-year arrangement under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF). It also
identifies the data to be report for program monitoring purposes.

I.

DEFINITION

2.
Unless otherwise indicated below, ―the government‖ is meant to include the government of
the Union of the Comoros and the autonomous island governments. Local governments, the central
bank, and any government-owned entity with independent legal status are excluded from the
definition of government. The units covered under this definition of government are consolidated
for the needs of the program.

II.

QUANTITATIVE PERFORMANCE CRITERIA

3.
New quantitative performance criteria are proposed for June 30, 2013 with respect to
changes in net domestic credit to the government and the zero limit on accumulation of new
domestic payment arrears; with indicative targets for March 31, 2013. The following performance
criteria are proposed for monitoring on a continuous basis: (i) the government‘s external payment
arrears; (ii) the contracting or guaranteeing of new nonconcessional external debt by the
government; and (iii) the contracting or guaranteeing of new short-term external debt by the
government.

A. Change in Net Domestic Credit to the Government
Definitions
4.
Net domestic credit to the government is defined as overall net credit extended to the
government from domestic bank and nonbank sources. Net bank credit to the government reflects
the net debt position of the government vis-à-vis the central bank, commercial banks, and the
National Postal and Financial Services Company (SNPSF), as well as microfinance institutions. It is the
difference between the government‘s gross indebtedness to the banking system and its claims on
the banking system. These government claims include all deposits at the central bank and
commercial banks, as well as Treasury cash holdings. The government‘s debt to the banking system
includes central bank credit (statutory advances as well as any long-term credit and IMF net credit)
and commercial bank credit, as well as net deposits at the SNPSF. Domestic nonbank credit to the
government includes changes in the stock of Treasury bills placed in the domestic market,
privatization receipts, and any other domestic financial debt of the government held outside the
banking sector other than arrears.

44 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UNION OF THE COMOROS

5.
The change in net domestic credit to the government as at the date for the performance
criterion or indicative target is defined as the difference between the stock on the date indicated
and the stock on December 31, 2011.
Performance criteria
6.
The amounts set out in Table 1 of the MEFP on net credit to government for December 31,
2012 and June 30, 2013 are ceilings and constitute performance criteria. The amounts set out in the
above table for September 30, 2012 and March 31, 201 are ceilings and constitute indicative targets.
Reporting requirements
7.
The Central Bank of the Comoros (BCC) will report the provisional data on net bank credit to
the government to Fund staff on a monthly basis, with a lag of no more than 45 days after the end
of each observation period. Final data will be reported with a maximum lag of two months. The
Ministry of Finance will report monthly on any financing from nonbank sources.

B. New domestic payment arrears
Definition
8.
New domestic payment arrears of the government are defined as any of the following:
(i) invoice that a spending ministry has received from a supplier of goods and services, delivered and
verified, and for which payment has not been made within 90 days from the date the payment order
(ordonnancement) was cleared; (ii) in the case of specific contracts between the suppliers and the
government, any invoice received and not paid on the due date stipulated in the contracts; (iii) tax
credits confirmed by the proper authorities after review, and not paid within 60 days from the date
when the payment order was issued; or (iv) wages and salaries and any payments to a government
employee that were due to be paid in a given month but remained unpaid on the 15th day of the
following month.
Performance criterion
9.
Under the program, the government will not accumulate any new domestic payment arrears.
The zero limit on new domestic payment arrears for June 30 and December 31, 2012 constitute
performance criteria. The zero limit on new domestic payment arrears for September 30, 2012 and
March 31, 2013 constitute indicative targets.

C. External payment arrears
Definition
10.
External payments arrears are defined as the sum of payments due but unpaid on
outstanding external debt (for a definition of external debt see paragraph 15) that has been
contracted or guaranteed by the government, with the exception of external payments arrears
arising from public debt being renegotiated with creditors, including Paris Club members.

UNION OF THE COMOROS

Performance criterion
11.
Under the program, the government will not accumulate any external payments arrears with
respect to the public debt, except for payments being renegotiated with creditors, including Paris
Club members. This performance criterion will be monitored on a continuous basis.

The authorities will report to Fund staff any accumulation of external payments arrears as
soon as the due date has been missed. They will provide each month, within a maximum lag of
15 days, a table showing external debt due (after rescheduling) and paid.

D. Ceiling on the Contracting or Guaranteeing of New Nonconcessional External
Debt or Short-Term Debt by the Government
Definition
13.
This performance criterion applies not only to debt as defined in Point 9 of the Guidelines
on Performance Criteria with Respect to Foreign Debt (Executive Board Decision No. 6230-(79/140),
last amended by Executive Board Decision No. 1441-(09/91), effective December 1, 2009), but also
to commitments contracted or guaranteed by the government for which value has not been
received.
14.
Short-term debt refers to external debt with a contractual maturity of less than one year.
External debt refers to debt owed to nonresidents.
15.
The definition of debt, as specified in Point 9 of the Guidelines on Performance Criteria with
Respect to Foreign Debt, reads as follows: ―(a) For the purposes of this guideline, the term ‗debt‘ will
be understood to mean a current, i.e., not contingent, liability, created under a contractual
arrangement through the provision of value in the form of assets (including currency) or services,
and which requires the obligor to make one or more payments in the form of assets (including
currency) or services, at some future point(s) in time; these payments will discharge the principal
and/or interest liabilities incurred under the contract. Debt can take a number of forms, including:
(i) loans, i.e., advances of money to the obligor by the lender made on the basis of an undertaking
that the obligor will repay the funds in the future (including deposits, bonds, debentures,
commercial loans, and buyers‘ credits) and temporary exchanges of assets that are equivalent to
fully collateralized loans under which the obligor is required to repay the funds, and usually pay
interest, by repurchasing the collateral from the buyer in the future (such as repurchase agreements
and official swap arrangements); (ii) suppliers‘ credits, i.e., contracts where the supplier permits the
obligor to defer payments until sometime after the date on which the goods are delivered or
services are provided; and (iii) leases, i.e., arrangements under which property is provided which the
lessee has the right to use for one or more specified period(s) of time that are usually shorter than
the total expected service life of the property, while the lessor retains the title to the property. For
the purpose of the guideline, the debt is the present value (at the inception of the lease) of all lease
payments expected to be made during the period of the agreement excluding those payments that
cover the operation, repair, or maintenance of the property; (b) Under the definition of debt set out
in point 9(a), arrears, penalties, and judicially awarded damages arising from the failure to make
payment under a contractual obligation that constitutes debt are debt. Failure to make payment on

46 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UNION OF THE COMOROS

an obligation that is not considered debt under this definition (e.g., payment on delivery) will not
give rise to debt.‖
16.
For program purposes, a debt is concessional if it includes a grant element of at least
50 percent, calculated as follows: the grant element of a debt is the difference between the present
value (PV) of debt and its nominal value, expressed as a percentage of the nominal value of the
debt. The PV of debt at the time of its contracting is calculated by discounting the future stream of
payments of debt service due on this debt1. The discount rates used for this purpose are the
currency specific commercial interest reference rates (CIRRs), published by the Organization for
Economic Cooperation Development (OECD). For debt with a maturity of at least 15 years, the tenyear-average CIRR will be used to calculate the PV of debt and, hence, its grant element. For debt
with a maturity of less than 15 years, the six-month average CIRR will be used. To both the ten-year
and six-month averages, the same margins for differing repayment periods as those used by the
OECD need to be added (0.75 percent for repayment periods of less than 15 years, 1 percent for
15 to 19 years, 1.15 percent for 20 to 29 years, and 1.25 percent for 30 years or more).
17.
For the purposes of this performance criterion, the government is understood to include the
government (as defined in paragraph 2 above), as well as local administrations, public institutions of
an industrial and commercial nature (EPICs), public administrative institutions (EPAs), public
enterprises, and government-owned or -controlled independent companies (i.e., public enterprises
with financial autonomy of which the government holds at least 50 percent of the capital).
Performance criterion
18.
The government as defined in paragraph 19 will not contract or guarantee nonconcessional
or short-term external debt as defined above. This performance criterion will be monitored on a
continuous basis. It does not apply to debt rescheduling and restructuring operations. In addition,
import-related credit and pre-export financing secured on export contracts of less than one year
maturity are excluded from this performance criterion on short-term debt.
Reporting requirements
19.
The authorities will report any new external borrowing and its terms to Fund staff as soon as
external debt is contracted or guaranteed by the government.

III.

Summary of Safeguards Assessment. An update of the August 2007 safeguards
assessment of the Banque Centrale des Comores (BCC) was completed in April 2010. The
safeguards assessment found that despite capacity constraints the central bank has taken
steps to strengthen its safeguards framework; it notably recommends the routine timely
publication of the full set of the Central Bank‘s financial statements, and the review by the
financial controller of data submitted to the Fund for each program test date, starting in
December 2009. The BCC has published its audited financial statements for 2010 and has
completed the audit of the financial statements for 2011. These will be published by endDecember 2012.

Exchange Rate Arrangements: The currency of the Comoros is the Comorian franc, which
is pegged to the Euro at €1 = CF 492. The Comoros has accepted the obligations of
Article VIII, Sections 2(a), 3, and 4, and maintains an exchange system that is free of
restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions.

XI.

Article IV Consultation: The last Article IV consultation was concluded on January
21, 2011 (Country Report No. 11/72). Directors commended the Comorian authorities for
their broadly satisfactory policies in a challenging political and economic environment.
They welcomed the improved fiscal performance in the first half of 2010. Expressing
concern at slippages later in the year, Directors welcomed the corrective steps taken and
urged the authorities to implement expeditiously planned revenue and expenditure
measures to strengthen the fiscal position. Directors underscored that achieving a higher
growth path will require far reaching structural reforms to bolster competitiveness and
increase the economy‘s ability to intermediate remittances and aid inflows. In particular,
they stressed the need to improve the business environment and the management of
public utilities.

III. RELATIONS WITH THE AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT
BANK GROUP
A. Bank Group’s Support in Comoros
1.
The African Development Bank Group (AfDB) started its operations in Comoros in 1977 and
has since then approved sixteen (16) operations and one (1) economic and sector work (ESW).
Cumulative Bank Group commitments net of cancellation amounted to UA [58.88] million as of
October 2012. These operations targeted the public sector and were mainly financed from ADF
resources (83.6 percent). One (1) port infrastructure project was financed through the ADB window
for a net UA 9.67 million representing 16.4 percent of total net commitments. In addition, the AfDB
approved three (3) emergency operations to assist in mitigating the adverse impact of the food crisis
in 2008 (UA 1.5 million) and support victims of floods in 2009 and most recently in 2012
((UA 1,28 million). In 2009, Comoros was among the first Bank‘s Regional Member Countries (RMCs)
to benefit from a UA 2.5 million support from the Fragile States Facility (FSF) targeted at capacity
building, namely for PRSP finalization, training of civil servants, revision of the fiscal code, fiscal
reorganization, preparation of the Public Finances Management (PFM) strategy and action plan and
capacity building to the Planning Commission (CGP) and to the Water and Sanitation Department. A
UA 0.6 million additional grant was also allocated to the Institutional Capacity Strengthening Project
(ICBP) in November 2010. Overall, AfDB operations in Comoros have been mainly directed toward
supporting economic-related infrastructure, support to public finances and improvement of rural
livelihoods. They have primarily concerned transport (40 percent), multi-sector (26 percent), water
and sanitation (17 percent), agriculture (11 percent) and education (6 percent).

B. Strategic Orientation
2.
The Bank Group concretely re-engaged in Comoros in 2010 following the resolution of the
Anjouan crisis and the lifting of sanctions in February 2009 after clearance of its arrears with the
Bank. A two-year Interim Country Strategy Paper (I-CSP) 2009-2010 focusing on economic and
financial governance and water and sanitation was approved in April 2009. In December 2011, the
Boards of AfDB has approved a new Country Strategy Paper (CSP) for 2011-2015 based on a single
pillar focusing on the energy sector in support to economic diversification. The new CSP draws on
the Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper for 2010-2014 and will span over two ADF cycles ADF 12 and ADF 13. Under ADF 12, the indicative country allocation will amount to UA 15.6 million,
including UA 10 million from the Fragile States Fragility (FSF). These resources will primarily aim to
finance (i) an energy sector project (UA 13.6 million) and (ii) a budget support (UA 2 million) whose
main objective will be to leverage the level of available domestic resources and assist the country in
reaching HIPC Completion Point by end 2012.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 57

UNION OF THE COMOROS

3.
As of 31 October 2012, the Bank‘s ongoing portfolio in Comoros funded under ADF 12
resources amounts to UA 16.5 Million comprising two operations: (i) the Institutional Capacities
Strengthening Project (ICSP) whose objective is to strengthen national capacities in PFM, debt
management and macroeconomic statistics and (ii) the Drinking Water and Sanitation Project
(DWSP). A comprehensive Energy Sector Support Project will be implemented early 2013 with cofinancing from the World Bank and Qatar. A Country Portfolio Performance Review (CPPR) will be
conducted in 2013.

C. Non Lending Activities
4.
Along with other developing partners, AfDB aims to provide Comoros authorities with policy
advice and decision tools on key strategic directions with the objective of leveraging and sustaining
economic growth over the medium-long term. In this respect, the first phase of a study on the
sources of growth in Comoros was completed in December 2010 and provided a series of
preliminary key recommendations on ways of boosting growth and improving the economic and
business climate. The new CSP 2011-2015 includes a series of economic and sector works (ESW)
covering strategic themes such as inclusive growth, competitiveness and employment as well as
private sector and commodity value chains.

IV. STATISTICAL ISSUES
Comoros—Statistical Issues Appendix
As of October 31, 2012
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has serious shortcomings that significantly hamper surveillance. The
statistical database has deficiencies in all sectors largely due to inadequate staffing and funding,
as well as lack of integration of island-based data. Some progress was made with collecting
income-distribution statistics and social welfare indicators when the Interim Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper (I-PRSP) was being prepared in 2003–04. Since then, coverage has remained
limited, hampering the monitoring of progress towards the Millennium Developing Goals
(MDGs).
National accounts. Shortcomings in national accounts compilation undermine accuracy and
reliability of the data and impart a high degree of uncertainty to economic analysis. The absence
of basic source data requires estimates of GDP to be prepared with outdated benchmarks and
rely on crude assumptions and extrapolations. Due to lack of funding and staffing, there have
been no survey-based national accounts since 1995, when one was prepared with UNDP
assistance, and to date there has been no survey at all on manufacturing. In 2004, with the
support of donors, a new population census and surveys on subsistence agriculture and
households were completed; unfortunately, these surveys have neither been fully processed nor
updated. A July 2006 AFR mission helped the authorities improve GDP estimates for 2001–05.
The African Development Bank assigned an international Expert from May 2011 to January 2012,
who helped the National Statistic Institute (NSI) with the compilation of a new base year and
implementation of new compilation techniques.
Consumer prices. The accuracy and reliability of the consumer price index (CPI) represents
another key source of uncertainty. Expenditure weights are based on a survey from the late
1980s and sub-indices are compiled irregularly across the islands. Most price data are collected
only for the country‘s capital. CPI compilation is largely conducted by one person. The African
Development Bank assigned an international Expert from May 2011 to January 2012, who helped
the NSI to design a new consumer price index (CPI). Baskets of products, expenditure weights,
collection locations as well as calculation techniques were revised. An IT tool was implemented
and the responsible official was trained in managing the whole compilation process.
Government finance statistics. In August/September 2005 an STA mission found that the
public chart of accounts did not accurately record the execution of the budget and that a
standardized presentation on outstanding public debt is not compiled. Classification of
budgetary data is often not consistent over time or across the islands. In particular, problems
arise in data on domestic arrears, external debt, and external support, including its investment
spending components, complicating fiscal analysis.
Monetary and financial statistics. The Central Bank of Comoros (BCC) produces adequate
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 59

UNION OF THE COMOROS

monetary statistics on its own accounts, for the commercial banks, the development bank, the
deposits collected by the Société nationale des postes et des services financiers (chèques
postaux and saving passbooks), and for two microfinance networks. The Franc Zone arrangement
has established accounting and prudential standards that prevent data disruptions. A major
shortcoming is the absence of data on the large amount of Euro cash in circulation,
handicapping surveillance. In June 2009 the BCC started reporting monetary and financial
statistics to the IMF using Standardized Report Forms (SRFs). The current presentation and
content of monetary statistics accords largely with the methodology in the IMF‘s Monetary and
Financial Statistics Manual 2000.
External sector statistics. The BCC compiles balance of payments statistics along the lines of the
methods recommended in IMF‘s Balance of Payments Manual, 5th edition. Despite technical
assistance and some improvements over the past few years, shortcomings in coverage and
compilation continue to affect accuracy and reliability and impart uncertainty to economic
analysis. A single BCC economist is responsible for compiling balance of payments statistics,
precluding desirable improvements needed in coverage and data validation, particularly for
trade, nonregistered trade, services, and foreign direct investment.

II. Data Standards and Quality
Comoros has initiated the process for
participating in the General Data Dissemination
System (GDDS).

No data ROSC is available.

III. Reporting to STA
Comoros does not report government finance statistics to STA for publication in the International
Financial Statistics (IFS) or in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook, nor does it report
balance of payments statistics in the IFS. Among national accounts data, only GDP is reported for
publication in the IFS.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
January 15, 2013

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation with
Comoros
On December 17, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Comoros.5
Background
Over the last two years, and despite a challenging external environment, economic activity in
the Union of Comoros has gained momentum. Real gross domestic product (GDP) increased by
2.2 percent in 2011, underpinned by favorable conditions in the agriculture sector, sustained
activity in the construction and public works, and a rebound in foreign direct investment.
Preliminary information points to a further strengthening of economic conditions in 2012, with
real growth rising to 2.5 percent on account of robust agricultural exports, resilient remittances
from expatriates, and increased external financial support. The depreciation of the euro against
the dollar and lingering upward pressures on international commodity prices slowed the
expected fall in inflation, which is likely to have reached 5 percent at end-2012. Thanks to a
solid performance of exports of cloves and buoyant official transfers, the external current
account deficit declined to 6.9 percent of GDP in 2012 from 9.0 percent in 2011.

5

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

62 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Against this background, the authorities have made steady progress in fiscal consolidation.
Following departures from some program targets at end-December 2010 and end-June 2011,
performance improved significantly after the new government introduced corrective revenue and
spending measures, including the reversal of a prohibitive 2010 public sector wage increase
and stepped-up tax arrears recovery efforts. As a result, the domestic primary budget deficit
was limited at 1.4 percent of GDP (excluding one-off nontax receipts); and all wage arrears
accumulated in the earlier months of 2011 were cleared by end-year. On the structural front,
several long-delayed measures were implemented, namely the completion of the census of the
civil service, parliamentary approval of legislation on new ministry personnel frameworks, and
intensification of technical discussions on reform of the public utilities with World Bank staff and
other development partners. On November 27, 2012, the authorities issued a call for bids from
potential investors for the state-owned telecommunication company, following approval of a
social plan in October.
Over the medium term, economic growth is expected to rise to an annual average of 4 percent,
underpinned by increased and more reliable availability of electricity; investment in
infrastructure and tourism; and improvements in the business environment. Inflation should
remain subdued, consistent with Comoros’ membership in the Franc zone. By 2015, the
authorities aim to bring the domestic primary fiscal balance to equilibrium, including by rising
government revenue to about 15 percent of GDP and containing wage payments at 7 percent of
GDP. Comoros’ external debt position is expected to improve significantly in the period following
the delivery of broad debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) and
Multilateral Debt Relief (MDRI) initiatives. However, in light of the country’s narrow export base,
large development needs, and high vulnerability to exogenous shocks, it is critical that the
government’s fiscal financing needs--including for pro-growth and pro-poor programs--continue
to be met mostly with grants, and that new borrowing is contracted on concessional terms for
the foreseeable future. This requires close adherence to reforms under the Extended Credit
Facility (ECF) and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper. Risks to the outlook include Comoros’
dependence on remittances, aid, and foreign direct investment inflows. Price shocks on key
import commodities, notably oil and food, could also depress growth and unsettle external and
fiscal balances. Risks related to a delay in the reform of state-owned enterprises have receded
over the past year, reflecting strengthened program ownership.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for their strong implementation of reforms under
the ECF arrangement and for reaching the completion point under the enhanced HIPC Initiative.
They looked forward to continued strong commitment to the program.
Directors welcomed the improved fiscal performance during 2012. They encouraged the
authorities to continue strengthening revenue mobilization and to keep spending in line with
68 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

public resource mobilization capacity, particularly with respect to the wage bill. In this regard,
priorities remain the establishment of the new General Administration of Taxes; the prompt
implementation of new ministry personnel frameworks; and a close adherence to the automated
wages management system. Directors welcomed the development of new frameworks for
improving governance in the public sector and encouraged their steadfast implementation.
Directors noted that, while debt sustainability will improve following the HIPC Initiative
completion point, Comoros will remain at high risk of debt distress owing notably to a narrow
export base. Therefore, they underscored the need for budget discipline and reliance on grants
and highly concessional loans in meeting the country’s financing needs.
Directors commended the authorities for rekindling their structural reform agenda to invigorate
growth, accelerate poverty reduction, and reduce vulnerability to external shocks. They called
for the rapid enlisting of reputable strategic partners in the management of the state-owned
telecommunications (Comores Telecom) and electricity (MA MWE) companies, and a more
efficient operation of the oil importing parastatal (SCH). Streamlining administrative
requirements to starting a company and developing reliable contract-enforcement mechanisms
would help to improve the business environment.
Directors underlined the importance of continued implementation of the 2010 safeguards
assessment recommendations and further strengthening banking supervision. Priorities are the
timely publication of the central bank’s financial statements, an early finalization of the new
banking law, and the establishment of the envisaged credit bureau.
Directors were encouraged by Comoros’ broadly favorable growth and poverty reduction
prospects in the post HIPC/MDRI era. They noted that improved data on poverty is needed to
inform progress toward the Millennium Development Goals. Rigorous policy implementation and
steady donor support will be required to secure tangible gains in living standards.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
December 17, 2012

International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Completes Fourth Review under Comoros’ ECF Arrangement, and
Approves US$2.3 Million Disbursement

The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today completed its fourth
review of the Union of Comoros’ economic performance under the program supported by the
Extended Credit Facility (ECF). Completion of the fourth review allows the disbursement of an
amount equivalent to SDR 1.5575 million (about US$2.30 million), bringing total disbursements
under the arrangement to SDR 10.46 million (about US$15.44 million).
The Executive Board also agreed that the Union of Comoros has taken the steps necessary to
reach its completion point under the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC)
Initiative.
This decision on the HIPC completion point is contingent upon the Executive Board of
the World Bank concluding that the Union of Comoros has reached the completion
point under the enhanced HIPC Initiative, after which a joint press release will be issued.
The three-year Extended Credit Facility (ECF) arrangement was approved in September
2009, for the equivalent of SDR 13.57 million (152.5 percent of quota).
Following the Executive Board’s discussion, Mr. Naoyuki Shinohara, Deputy Managing
Director and Acting Chair, made the following statement:
“Performance under the ECF-supported program has improved commendably. Economic
activity and the fiscal position are strengthening, and Comoros has met the conditions for
reaching the HIPC Initiative completion point.
“The recent gains in macroeconomic sustainability will have to be consolidated. This requires
further strengthening revenue collection and keeping spending compatible with fiscal
sustainability. Critical to that end will be the establishment of the new General Administration
of Taxes and implementation of new ministry personnel frameworks, as well as close adherence
to the automated wages management system. The efforts to promote good governance will also
have to be stepped-up, including rigorous implementation of the new COMESA-based public
procurement code.
66 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

THE UNION OF THE COMOROS

“Prudent borrowing policies remain indispensable. While debt sustainability will improve
following the HIPC Initiative completion point, Comoros remains at high risk of debt distress
owing notably to a narrow export base. This underscores the need for fiscal discipline and
reliance on grants and highly concessional loans in meeting the country’s financing needs.
“The authorities are to be commended for rekindling the structural reform agenda to invigorate
growth and accelerate poverty reduction. The focus will be on enlisting reputable strategic
partners in the management of the state-owned telecommunication (Comores Telecom) and
electricity (MA-MWE) companies; and on ensuring a more efficient operation of the oilimporting parastatal (SCH). The authorities will also step up removal of excessive
administrative requirements to starting a company and of unreliable contract-enforcement
mechanisms for the private sector. In the financial sector, the banking supervision agenda and
recommendations from the 2010 safeguards assessment will continue to be rigorously
implemented, and the establishment of a new credit bureau expedited.
“Comoros’ growth and poverty reduction prospects are broadly favorable in the postHIPC/MDRI era. Rigorous policy implementation and steady donor support will be key to
securing tangible gains in living standards for the population.”

Statement by Kossi Assimaidou, Executive Directfor for the Union of the Comoros
December 12, 2012

Introduction

I would like to thank the Board, management and staff for their continued support to the Union of
the Comoros. This support has been invaluable in helping the country address difficult challenges
and implement far reaching reforms, and in meeting the HIPC Completion Point triggers. My
authorities also highly value the assistance provided by regional and development partners. This
assistance has been critical in helping the country address its difficult political and economic
situation and lay the foundation for political stability and economic development. Progress in all
sectors has been noteworthy in the past year-and-a-half, as can be seen by the satisfactory
implementation of the ECF-supported program. As my authorities continue to address the
challenges ahead, they would like to reiterate their firm commitment to the policies envisaged under
the ECF which they view as crucial to reducing poverty and raising living standards while enhancing
the economy‘s competitiveness.
The implementation of the ECF-supported program has been pursued with determination, with all
end-June 2012 quantitative performance criteria and indicative targets met. Performance in the
fiscal area was particularly strong with the domestic primary balance recording a surplus of 2.1
percent of GDP —significantly exceeding the 0.2 percent deficit target under the program. Fiscal
revenues also largely exceeded program target thanks to renewed tax collection efforts and largerthan-anticipated receipts from the economic citizenship program. High revenue mobilization and
strict control over expenditures helped to maintain the indicative target of net credit to the
government within program limits.
On the structural front, all end-June 2012 structural benchmarks were also met, including the
adoption by Parliament of the law establishing the new General Tax and Property Administration,
and the establishment by the government of a new payroll file for its employees that is consistent
with the findings of the civil service census. Significant progress has also been achieved in the
restructuring of public utilities, with the adoption of a strategy to reform the water and electricity
company (MA-MWE).
As regards performance under the HIPC Initiative, my authorities have met all but one of the sixteen
completion point triggers, and as indicated by staff in the report, they have fulfilled the conditions
for reaching the HIPC Initiative completion point. My authorities are therefore requesting the
Executive Board‘s support for access to debt relief under HIPC and MDRI. Full debt relief would
reduce the country‘s NPV of debt-to-exports from 343 percent at end-December 2009 to a more
sustainable 78.9 percent at end-December 2012. This will also create the necessary fiscal space to

further increase spending on priority sectors and accelerate poverty reduction. My authorities would
like to reassure the Board that they remain fully committed to ensuring that all external financing
needs are largely covered by grants and that they will contract debt only on concessional terms.
II.

Recent Economic Developments

Comoros‘ main macroeconomic indicators have improved in 2012. Real GDP growth rose to 2.5
percent —from 2.2 percent in 2011— driven by a good harvest of the country‘s main cash crops
(cloves and vanilla) and sustained activity in the construction and public works sectors. Both sectors
benefited respectively from the resilience of remittances from the Diaspora residing notably in
Europe, and increased foreign assistance, including from EU member countries, despite the crisis
affecting the continent. Inflation is projected to decline to 5 percent in 2012 from 7 percent in 2011
as pressure from international prices of the country‘s key imports abates.
The fiscal position improved markedly in 2012 largely due to the authorities‘ renewed revenue
mobilization efforts and more effective control of spending, particularly the wage bill. It is my
authorities‘ firm intention to maintain the wage bill within limits compatible with the capacity to
mobilize domestic revenue. Although overall fiscal revenues are expected to reach 18.2 percent of
GDP in 2012, compared to 16.1 in 2011 (this includes revenue from the economic citizenship
program which amounts to 4.5 percent of GDP in 2012), they have decided to save the bulk of the
revenue windfall, and allocate the reminder to infrastructure rehabilitation and health-related
programs, given the volatility of revenues from the economic citizenship program. The primary fiscal
balance is thus expected to record a surplus of 2.2 percent of GDP in 2012 compared to 1.6 percent
in 2011, and net bank financing to the government will decline by 0.8 percent (an expansion of 1
percent was projected under the program).
Despite rising imports, notably fuel, the external current account deficit is projected to narrow
significantly in 2012 to 6.9 percent of GDP from 9 percent in 2011. This reflects the relatively strong
performance of the exports of cash crop (mainly cloves) and a sharp increase in public and private
transfers. International reserves are projected to reach seven months of imports.
III.

Medium-Term Economic Policies

My authorities remain committed to sound and prudent fiscal and monetary policies under the ECF
going forward. They also intend to accelerate progress towards finalizing the far-reaching structural
reforms underway —mainly the restructuring of public enterprises—, which they consider to be
essential for raising the economy‘s competitiveness and growth potential. Their steadfast
commitment to ongoing reforms, along with the anticipated debt relief under HIPC and MDRI
should enable real GDP growth to reach the projected 3.5 percent in 2013 and 4 percent beyond.
The inflation outlook also remains broadly positive, with year-on-year inflation expected to recede in
2013 to lower single-digit as pressures from international fuel and food prices subside.

A.

Fiscal Policy

Ongoing efforts to raise the revenue-to-GDP ratio will continue in the period ahead while control
over spending, particularly the wage bill, will intensify.
With the new General Tax and Property Administration—which will be operational in March 2013—
and the establishment of an electronic network between the country‘s four major customs offices
expected by June 30, 2013, the efficiency of tax and customs administrations will be significantly
strengthened. This should contribute to improve the authorities‘ revenue mobilization performance.
To enhance control over the wage bill, the government will continue to adhere strictly to the new
automated personnel expenditure management system. The authorities are also committed to
gradually phasing in the increase in the number of government employees needed to reach the
optimum size of the civil service —compared to the actual census number—in order to preserve the
medium-term sustainability of the wage bill.
B.

Monetary Policy and the Financial System

The membership of the Union of the Comoros to the Zone franc has been a critical anchor for
macroeconomic stability. The monetary authorities will pursue their current prudent policy stance
aimed at preserving price stability while ensuring adequate supply of liquidity to the economy.
Given the country‘s more positive economic outlook and growing confidence in the economy, credit
to the private sector is projected to increase to 11 percent in 2013 against the backdrop of
improved profitability of financial institutions and decline in NPLs. As financial intermediation
expands, the central bank will set up a credit information repository (centrale des risques) to
promote the sound development of credit. The ongoing process for the privatization of the Banque
de Développement des Comores and the restructuring of the Société Nationale des Postes et des
Services Financiers (separation of the banking and postal functions and sale of a substantial stake to
a new foreign partner) will help improve both institutions‘ financial situation while enabling a more
efficient allocation of credit to the economy.
C.

Structural Reforms

Key steps have recently been taken to accelerate the restructuring of public enterprises with the
objective to further enhancing the competitiveness of the economy. With assistance from the World
Bank, AfDB, and the EU, the government of Comoros recently completed the reform strategies of
Comores Télécom, MA-MWE (the electricity and water utility) and Société Comorienne des
Hydrocarbures (company in charge of importing and distributing fuel).
With assistance from the IFC, the government issued a call for expressions of interest for Comores
Télécom in late November 2012 for the sale of 51 percent of the company to a strategic partner of
international standing. For MA-MWE, the government also issued a call for expressions of interest to

THE UNION OF THE COMOROS

recruit a specialized partner in charge of strengthening the company‘s commercial operations. This
will require the introduction of a flexible, cost-based pricing policy and a substantial improvement in
the customers‘ collection rate. The plan to revitalize Société Comorienne des Hydrocarbures foresees
notably the development of appropriate price structures for the various petroleum products sold.
D.

Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper

My authorities welcome the findings of the second annual progress report on PRSP implementation
which underscores progress achieved in a number of areas, including infrastructure development
such as road rehabilitation, the recovery of tourism and fishing, and political governance. However,
my authorities are also aware of the shortcomings highlighted in the report and are determined to
address them swiftly. In particular, weak capacity to absorb available resources has had an adverse
impact on some of the country‘s social indicators. The lack of updated data on poverty also remains
a major constraint. The authorities intend to improve the socio-demographic and macroeconomic
databases needed for effective design and monitoring of development policies. In this regard, they
are thankful to their development partners for the substantial T/A provided, including in the
preparation of national accounts and the consumer price index.
IV.

Conclusion

In view of my authorities‘ strong performance under the ECF-supported program and satisfactory
implementation of completion point triggers, I would appreciate the Board‘s support for the
completion of the fourth review under the ECF, and access to debt relief under HIPC and MDRI for
the Union of the Comoros.
