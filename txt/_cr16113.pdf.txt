IMF Executive Board Concludes 2016 Article IV Consultation with Romania
On May 9, 2016, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation 1 with Romania.
The Romanian economy is on a cyclical upswing supported by strong domestic demand. Recent
hikes in minimum and public wages, record low interest rates, low fuel prices, and a ValueAdded Tax (VAT) reduction have boosted private consumption. A catch-up in absorption of
European Union (EU) funds has contributed to an increase in investment. Annual headline
inflation turned negative in June 2015 following a sharp reduction in VAT on food items from 24
to 9 percent. However, adjusting for the VAT changes, underlying inflation was 2.4 percent
(year-over-year) in March 2016 (Eurostat estimate) despite the recent fall in international
commodity prices and low inflation in the euro area. There has been welcome progress in
reducing banking sector non-performing loans.
Growth is expected to reach 4.2 percent in 2016—largely due to the one-off stimulus to
consumption from the recent fiscal expansion—and decelerate to 3.6 percent in 2017.
Underlying inflation is expected to continue growing and the current account deficit to widen
further because of import growth.
Two main risks to the economic outlook are electoral and external uncertainties. On the domestic
side, populist measures in an election year could negatively affect market confidence and
undermine investment. On the external side, a deterioration in emerging market risk perception
could trigger capital outflows, a depreciation of the currency, and a substantial increase in the
external debt-to-GDP ratio. Maintaining adequate reserve levels, a flexible exchange rate regime,
and fiscal buffers will be key in mitigating risks. Improving Romania’s long-term growth
prospects to close the gap with advanced EU countries will depend on maintaining prudent
macroeconomic policies and advancing the pace of structural reforms.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors welcomed the significant progress in reducing vulnerabilities after the global
financial crisis, notably the marked improvements in fiscal and external balances and in the
resilience of the banking sector. Directors observed, however, that there are downs ide risks to the
economic outlook. They also noted with concern the recent procyclical fiscal relaxation, changes
in financial sector legislation that could adversely affect financial stability, and the slowdown in
structural reforms. Directors underscored the importance of implementing prudent economic
policies and regaining the structural reform momentum to preserve Romania’s hard-won gains
and raise medium-term growth potential.
Directors emphasized the need to ensure fiscal sustainability and the credib ility of the fiscal
framework. In light of the large fiscal relaxation adopted last year, it is crucial that fiscal policy
is anchored on a credible debt reduction path going forward. Repealing the planned tax
reductions or postponing them until offsetting measures are identified will help achieve these
objectives. Directors also underscored the importance of strengthening fiscal institutions and
strictly enforcing fiscal rules and the fiscal responsibility law. They welcomed recent steps to
enhance transparency in public spending, and called on the authorities to accelerate
complementary reforms to strengthen the spending review unit, pass the procurement law,
improve the targeting of social protection schemes, and strengthen public administration more
broadly.
Directors highlighted the urgency of stepping up structural reforms to unlock Romania’s
potential growth, particularly by improving the efficiency of public investment and the business
climate. They called for intensified efforts to strengthen the corporate governance of state-owned
enterprises—including through passage of the draft legislation in parliament—and improve the
planning and utilization of EU funds. Directors also encouraged further reforms in tax
administration, focusing on large taxpayers and making tax administration more business
friendly more generally. It will also be important that policies on public and minimum wages
take into account fiscal space, productivity growth, and competitiveness considerations.
Directors commended the authorities for the progress in fighting corruption and encouraged them
to address remaining weaknesses.
Directors concurred that a tightening bias in monetary policy is appropriate given current
inflation projections. They recommended that the authorities begin reducing the gap between the
market and policy rates, absorb liquidity from the market, and further narrow the interest rate
corridor, while continuing to enhance the effectiveness of the monetary policy framework.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers
used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

Maintaining adequate international reserves remains crucial in light of elevated uncertainty in
global financial markets.
Directors welcomed the significant progress in strengthening the financial sector, particularly in
reducing non-performing loans. Priorities going forward are to pursue predictable and marketfriendly policies and ensure proper oversight. In this context, Directors cautioned that poorly
targeted measures for providing debt relief to borrowers could undermine financial stability,
legal predictability, and credit growth. They called on the authorities to reconsider the recently
passed measures and to put adequate safeguards in place. Sustained efforts to further deepen
financial intermediation are critical to foster private investment and growth.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
April 22, 2016

KEY ISSUES
Background. Romania made important progress in addressing economic imbalances in
recent years. Prudent policies, partly in the context of successive Fund-supported
programs, reduced vulnerabilities, and the fiscal and current account deficits improved
markedly. However, economic policies have weakened recently and hard-won gains are
at risk. Fiscal policy is pro-cyclical and the fiscal deficit is projected to increase
substantially in 2016 and remain high in 2017, putting public debt on a gradually rising
trajectory. Progress on structural reforms has slowed. Some recently passed measures,
and others under consideration in parliament, could threaten property rights and
damage the financial sector.
Outlook and risks. Recent stimulus measures have raised cyclical—but not structural—
growth. Underlying inflation, adjusted for recent tax reductions, is expected to gradually
pick up. Risks to the outlook are tilted to the downside and relate mostly to a possible
further weakening of policies in an election year and external uncertainties.
Policy recommendations. Regain the reform momentum, protect hard-won gains, and
guard against further weakening of policies in the run up to elections.
 Fiscal policy. Anchor fiscal policy on a debt-reduction path and gradually reduce the
cash deficit to 1½ percent of GDP by 2018. Strengthen the credibility of fiscal institutions
and enhance governance, transparency, and efficiency of public administration.
 Monetary policy. Maintain the policy rate for now, but signal a tightening bias and
begin to reduce the gap between the market and policy rates by absorbing excess
liquidity from the market and narrowing the interest rate corridor.
 Financial sector. Sustain improvement in bank balance sheets and safeguard
financial stability in the face of legislative initiatives that could undermine it. Support
financial intermediation, including through promoting capital market development.
 Structural reforms. Sustain recent progress in the fight against corruption. Raise
quality of public investment and increase EU funds absorption. Support private
investment by making regulations and tax administration more business friendly while
supporting revenues. Avoid excessive minimum wage increases in the near future.

BACKGROUND
1.
Romania made important progress in
addressing economic imbalances and restoring
growth after the global financial crisis. Prudent
policies, partly in the context of successive Fundsupported programs, reduced vulnerabilities and the
fiscal and current account deficits improved
markedly. More recently, the banks’ non-performing
loans (NPL) have begun to come down. Per capita
income has surpassed pre-crisis levels as growth has
been robust and is projected to be amongst the
highest in the region in the near term.

2.
However, economic policies have weakened recently and hard-won gains are at risk of
being reversed. Last year, parliament approved measures with broad political support that are
projected to substantially increase the fiscal deficit in 2016 and keep it high in 2017. This stimulus
was not needed as consumption growth was already strong. It will also reverse the consolidation
trend of recent years and put public debt on a gradually rising trajectory. Recent measures to
provide relief to distressed borrowers are not well targeted and could threaten property rights and
damage the financial sector. Progress on structural reforms has slowed, constraining potential
growth. The current technocratic government took office in November 2015 and the window for
passing reforms legislation will narrow in the run up to parliamentary elections before end-2016.
3.
Governance problems have received more attention recently and Romania has made
progress compared to its peers in the fight against corruption. Corruption is not only a key
socio-economic but also a key macroeconomic issue in Romania (Box 1). In recent years, Romania
has been recognized for its progress in the fight against corruption and the anticorruption agency
has high public opinion ratings. Romania’s position in perception of corruption indicators produced
by Transparency International and the World Bank has improved in recent years.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
4.
The economy is on a cyclical upswing supported by strong domestic demand. The
recent growth pickup was driven mainly by private consumption on the back of recent hikes in
minimum and public wages. In addition, record low interest rates, low fuel prices, and a VAT
reduction on food items supported consumer confidence and demand (Figure 1). Investment has
recently shown some signs of a pickup partly related to a catch-up in EU funds absorption and
helped offset a weakening of exports in the second half of the year.
5.
Headline inflation has turned negative but underlying inflation—adjusted for recent
VAT cuts—is positive and trending up (Figure 4). Annual headline inflation turned negative in

4

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ROMANIA

June 2015 following a sharp reduction in VAT on food items from 24 to 9 percent. However,
adjusting for the VAT changes, underlying inflation has remained positive and been rising, despite
the recent fall in international commodity prices and low inflation in the euro area. Although
headline inflation may decline in the coming months due to indirect effects from the recent fall in oil
prices and VAT reduction, pressure is building on underlying inflation due to a closing output gap,
fast wage growth, and a strong fiscal impulse (Annex VI and Selected Issues Paper).

Nominal and real wage growth is
accelerating (Figure 3). Overall wages grew by
11.6 percent (y/y) in January 2016, reflecting public
wage and minimum wage hikes. Minimum wage is
expected to be raised again to 1,250 lei in May 2016
(about €265) from 1,050 lei. These hikes marked a
record high for Romania and are the steepest among
European peers since 2000. As these exceeded
productivity gains, unit labor costs increased by
2.2 percent in 2015 and by 7.6 percent since 2010.

0.4 percent of GDP in the first quarter compared to 0.7 percent in the same period of 2015. The
difference reflects mainly lower VAT revenues.
8.
The current account deficit is small and widened modestly in 2015. The main drivers of
last year’s deficit were the increase in goods trade deficit and the almost doubling of primary
income deficit due to estimated reinvested earnings and interest related to government payments.
FDI inflows improved moderately due to the reinvestment of earnings and the recovery of the
economy. Despite large repayments to the Fund and the EU, gross reserves of €35.5 billion at end2015 were broadly adequate by most reserve adequacy metrics (Annex IV). The current account
deficit is projected to gradually widen in 2016–17 as domestic demand grows, and reach around
3.5 percent of GDP over the medium term.

Banks’ NPLs have come down markedly and
credit is beginning to grow but risks remain. The
NPL ratio fell to 14 percent at end-2015 compared to a
peak of 22 percent in 2014Q1 reflecting write-offs and
sales prompted by the National Bank of Romania’s
(NBR) efforts. Credit growth is beginning to turn the
cycle, with growth in local currency lending more than
offsetting the continued decline in foreign currency
lending. The banking system, on average, continues to
enjoy comfortable levels of capital adequacy and
liquidity, and profitability is improving (Figure 6).
Nevertheless, banks remain exposed to credit risk due
to FX mismatches in borrowers’ balance sheets and
market risk related to large bond holdings. During last
summer, four Greek-owned Romanian banks
experienced substantial deposit withdrawals. The
authorities deftly managed the stress episode and
deposit withdrawals have largely been reversed. The
NBR has also recently introduced additional capital
buffer requirements such as a capital conservation
buffer, a countercyclical capital buffer (currently set at
zero), a buffer for systemically important institutions,
and a systemic risk buffer to enhance the set of macroprudential tools.

1/ In December 2015, NBR moved from a national definition to an EBA
methodology-based definition of NPLs.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
10.
Staff’s baseline projection is for growth to remain above potential in 2016–17. After a
near-term cyclical acceleration driven mostly by domestic consumption and a strong fiscal impulse,
growth is expected to return gradually to

(2.8 percent of GDP on a cash basis) as there is a
wide level of political consensus to not exceed this threshold, but this would require additional
measures.
11.
Risks to the outlook are tilted to the downside and relate mostly to the pre-electoral
environment and external uncertainties (Annex II). Further fiscal stimulus in an election year may
boost consumption in the short term but will undermine sustainability of public finances and could
dent market sentiment. Inappropriate measures targeting the financial sector that lack proper
impact analysis and consultation could harm credit intermediation and investment, and undermine
financial stability. On the external side, an abrupt deterioration in emerging market risk perception
could trigger currency depreciation and raise the external debt-to-GDP ratio (Annex III). During the
recent period of elevated volatility in emerging markets in 2015, Romania experienced sudden
capital outflows, though not as pronounced as in regional peers. Maintaining adequate reserve
levels, exchange rate flexibility, and fiscal buffers will be key in mitigating risks.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Fiscal Policy

Fiscal policy is pro-cyclical and will put public debt on a gradually rising trajectory. The
authorities adopted in late 2015 a package of large tax cuts costing 1.4 percent of GDP in 2016 and

under current policies, well above the authorities’ cash deficit target of 2.8 percent of GDP for 2016

The new tax code involves a welcome simplification of taxation legislation and has some small measures with
positive revenue effects, including base broadening of social security contributions.
2

The budget deterioration related to the new tax code and the public wages increases is estimated at about
2.4 percent of GDP in 2016 and 0.8 percent in 2017 as shown in the text table. The increase in the 2016 deficit over
2015 is less than 2.4 percent of GDP mainly because the 2015 deficit incorporated about 1.1 percent of GDP of
temporary deficit-increasing factors that will not occur in 2016 and 2017.

vulnerability to a sudden deterioration in public
Note: The line "Budget deficit at 2.8 percent of GDP" is based
finances and the need for adequate fiscal buffers. on a deficit of 2.8 percent of GDP in cash terms (equivalent to
3 percent in ESA terms) from 2016 onwards.
The importance of keeping debt on a downward
path was emphasized in previous Article IV consultations (Annex I).
15.
Staff recommended gradual adjustment to lower the cash deficit to 1.5 percent of GDP
by 2018. The effort should start this year by finding and preserving savings aiming to keep the
deficit below 2.5 percent of GDP. For 2017, staff recommended a deficit of 2 percent of GDP. Given
relatively low levels of public spending, staff recommends achieving the adjustment by postponing
the further tax reductions on VAT and excises scheduled to come into effect next year until other
off-setting measures can be identified. This would generate savings of ¾ percent of GDP. As the
incremental adjustment recommended for 2017 is ½ percent of GDP, these savings could be used
for both achieving the deficit target and addressing other needs such as in the health and education
sectors or for the gradual implementation of the unified wage law.3
16.
Staff supported the government’s efforts to bolster efficiency and transparency in
government spending and public administration. The authorities have made progress in
prioritization of large public investment projects—as recommended by the August 2015 TA mission
on public financial management—and the mission recommended extending this to cover mediumsized and local government investments. Steps have also been taken to enhance transparency of
spending of public entities and the government plans to widen the use of centralized procurement.
Staff recommended early passage of the public procurement law that should help to improve
accountability and efficiency of public spending. The government also plans to carry out a spending
review and staff recommended that the review start with a few pilot sectors to identify room for
efficiency gains (see Selected Issues Paper). Targeting of social protection schemes should be
strengthened. The approval of the draft law on natural resource taxation will give certainty on the
tax framework.
3

Recent public wage increases have exacerbated distortions in the remuneration system. Staff has recommended in
the past to eliminate these distortions through adopting and gradually implementing a unified wage law in line with
available fiscal space.

17.
The national and sub-national fiscal rules are sound but their enforcement has been
weak, undermining the credibility of the fiscal institutions. The Fiscal Responsibility Law (FRL),
fiscal council, and fiscal rule follow European standards (Annex V). However, the budget for 2016,
approved outside the context of a program with international financial institutions, breaches the
fiscal rule. In order to do so, the budget law waived the provisions of the FRL and of the fiscal rule.
There is scope to better integrate the Fiscal Council’s work into the decision making of parliament,
increase public awareness of the rules, better track the risk of breaching them, and strengthen the
automatic sanctions envisaged by the FRL to incentivize responsible parties to apply the rules.
Authorities’ views
18.
The authorities agreed with the merits of anchoring fiscal policy on a debt reduction
path but believed that next year’s deficit target was achievable without further measures and
that there was little appetite in parliament to reduce the deficit further. The authorities agreed
with the importance of finding and preserving fiscal savings and were confident that this year’s cash
deficit target of 2.8 percent of GDP would be met. For next year, they believed that the deficit target
of 2.8 percent was achievable without further measures, unlike under staff projections. They viewed
that reducing the 2017 deficit further would require legislative action, such as postponing the
further tax reductions on VAT and excises scheduled to come into effect in 2017, for which they
expected to find little support in parliament.

B. Structural Reforms
19.
A renewed push for structural reforms is needed to improve public and private
investment and raise potential growth. These reforms were one of the main focus areas of the
most recent Fund-supported program. However, progress was mixed and the program went off
track partially because of insufficient progress on structural reforms. While progress has been made
to improve governance, other structural reforms have stalled and seem insufficient to raise private
investment which remains well below pre-crisis levels. The key challenges are to improve the
corporate governance of state-owned enterprises (SOEs), restructure those that have sustained
long-standing problems and pose a drain on the budget, raise EU-funds absorption, and improve
the investment climate.
20.
Staff welcomed recent progress in the fight against corruption and encouraged
continued vigor to address remaining challenges.


10

Corruption has been one of the top three obstacles for doing business in Romania according to
the World Bank’s and EBRD’s Business Environment and Enterprise Performance survey, holding
back investment and growth. It is also associated with lower tax collections as evidenced by
Romania’s large VAT gap in the EU (estimated at almost 6 percent of GDP) and misallocation of
public resources; in a recent EU survey over half of the companies that participated in a public
procurement procedure in the last three years believed there was collusive bidding, conflict of
interests in the evaluation of bids, and bribes and kickbacks. Romania is one of two countries in
the EU subject to the “cooperation and verification mechanism” to help improve governance.
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ROMANIA



The authorities have undertaken several measures to step up the fight against corruption
including passage of a new Criminal and Criminal Procedures Code in 2014, stepping up efforts
to investigate and prosecute those suspected of corruption—including high profile figures,
expediting the judicial process to secure convictions, and measures to enhance the transparency
and efficiency of government spending discussed in ¶16. As a result, Romania’s ranking in
corruption indicators has improved. In its most recent assessment released in January 2016, the
European Commission (EC) noted that the “track record of the key judicial and integrity
institutions to address high-level corruption has remained impressive.”



Notwithstanding this progress, further reforms are needed in the areas of public procurement
and allocation of public funding, effectiveness of corruption investigations, establishment of
conflict of interest rules, and strengthening the National Integrity Agency’s capabilities to
monitor asset declarations (Box 1).

Improving public investment
21.
Reforms that improve the efficiency of public investment in critical infrastructure
sectors are essential for sustainable growth. SOEs play an important role in the major
infrastructure sectors and their improved governance as well as larger involvement of private capital
in those sectors remain key reform priorities. Staff recommended early adoption and steadfast
implementation of the draft legislation on improving corporate governance of SOEs. Staff also
advised to accelerate initial public offerings (IPOs) and the privatization program. All SOEs should be
put on a firm financial footing. In some cases aggressive restructuring may be required, and in other
cases, liquidation. These reforms would help improve the professionalism of SOEs’ management and
resource allocation, raise profitability, reduce subsidies, and contain contingent liabilities for the
state. In the energy sector, market deregulation for non-residential consumers has been largely
successful and the deregulation of electricity and gas markets for residential consumers should
continue.

22.
Improving absorption of EU funds will boost infrastructure investment. Several actions
can help: passing the draft procurement law currently in parliament transposing EU directives,
preparing an action plan for the new programming period (2014–20), appropriately preparing
documentation to be sent to the EC to avoid delays in processing, and prioritizing projects. Shifting
ongoing projects under the previous programming period (2007–13) to the new programming
period can increase absorption as some of the steps for their implementation would already have
been completed. More generally, there should be a systematic effort to limit domestic financing of
projects that qualify for EU funds.
Raising private investment
23.
Making regulations and tax administration business friendly will support revenues and
help attract private investment, particularly FDI. Overall, Romania ranks 37th out of 189 countries
in the 2016 Doing Business rankings (a lower rank signifies better ranking). Nevertheless, there is
room for improvement in the areas of construction permits, property registration, protection of
minority investors, and tax administration. Regarding the latter, reform efforts should focus on the
taxpayers’ single window, electronic filing, consolidation of small taxes, online centralized taxpayer
database, and improving timeliness of VAT refunds. In addition, revenue collection will improve if
the tax administration agency strengthens its risk-based audit system and large taxpayer unit. The
authorities have requested further Fund technical

and in labor-intensive industries. Staff recommended that the pace of future minimum wage
increases be moderate and balance social considerations with competitiveness, productivity growth,
and employment prospects. More generally, it would be useful to establish labor market expert
committee and periodically reassess the impact of labor market policy including minimum wages.
Authorities’ views
25.
The authorities broadly agreed with staff recommendations and hoped to make
progress in pending areas. On corruption they emphasized that Romania should be recognized for
the progress it has made in the fight against corruption; many other countries in the region had
worse corruption indicators and had made less progress. They were hopeful that amendments to
the revised law on corporate governance for SOEs and the draft procurement law would be passed
soon by parliament. They noted that prospects for IPOs depended on progress in the legal case
regarding one of the SOEs. The authorities broadly shared staff’s assessment on minimum wage
policy. They have established a working group comprising government officials and social partners
to study and make clear guidelines for setting the minimum wage, following the EC’s
recommendation. The new mechanism will help to improve the transparency in determining the
future level of minimum wage. The working group is expected to present the new proposal by
May 2016.

C. Monetary Policy
26.
Against the backdrop of declining inflation, policy rate cuts provided significant
stimulus in recent years. The policy rate has declined from 6 percent in 2011 to the current
1.75 percent. The NBR also narrowed the

2015 have contributed to a buildup of liquidity

27.
While headline inflation is currently negative, underlying inflation, adjusted for recent
tax changes, has been rising. Given strong domestic demand, a closing output gap, the large fiscal
impulse, and significant wage growth, headline inflation (without policy action) is expected to rise to
close to 3½ percent, the upper bound of the variation band of the inflation target, by end-2017
under staff and NBR projections.

1/ The uncertainty interval was calculated based on the annual CPI inflation forecast errors for Romania
from the IMF World Economic Outlook during April 2003– October 2015, following the methodology
described in Elekdag and Kannan (2009).

28.
Under current inflation projections, staff recommended leaving the policy rate
unchanged for now but to begin to reduce the gap between the policy and interbank rates.
Given current negative headline inflation, low expected imported inflation, and the uncertainty
around inflation expectations, the policy rate can be left unchanged until projected inflation moves
more clearly above target. Nonetheless, the NBR should consider signaling a tightening bias and
begin to reduce the gap between the market and policy rates by absorbing liquidity and narrowing
the interest rate corridor; this will also strengthen the monetary policy framework. Given the large
pro-cyclical fiscal impulse, monetary policy may need to shoulder some of the burden for managing
domestic demand.
29.
In staff’s view the Romanian leu is broadly in line with medium-term fundamentals
(Annex IV). Staff’s overall assessment is that Romania’s external position in 2015 was broadly in line
with fundamentals. Reserve coverage is broadly adequate according to most reserve adequacy
metrics. In line with staff recommendations, the NBR limited interventions in 2015 compared to the
previous year. However, the excess liquidity in the domestic market and worsening of global
sentiment prompted it to increase FX sales in the latter part of 2015 and in early 2016.
Authorities’ views
30.
The authorities noted that monetary policy decisions would depend on NBR Board’s
views regarding inflationary pressures and impact on financial markets. They agreed that
inflation projections had risen and were approaching the upper bound of the variation band of the
inflation target in 2017. Nevertheless, they also pointed out that in the current regional environment
of low rates, monetary tightening may prompt short-term capital inflows and hence their preference
for a gradual approach to policy normalization. The authorities also shared staff’s view that the
Romanian currency is broadly in line with its equilibrium level. They recognized the importance of
maintaining adequate reserves, particularly against heightened uncertainty in international financial
markets.

The authorities need to sustain their efforts to improve bank balance sheets and resist
measures that could undermine the stability of the banking system and legal predictability.
The recent reduction in NPLs is welcome, and efforts to encourage write-offs and sales of distressed
assets should continue. A key near-term risk to bank balance sheets is legislative initiatives that
would allow unilateral and retroactive changes to contracts. In April 2016, parliament adopted with
broad support a law allowing consumers to unilaterally discharge any debt owed to banks that is
collateralized by residential real property through the transfer of the collateral to the creditor
(“Giving in Payment” law; Box 2). The intended relief to distressed borrowers is not well targeted and
the retroactive application of the law could negatively affect bank balance sheets, undermine private
property rights, legal predictability and investor sentiment, and curtail credit provision. Debt relief to
distressed borrowers should be targeted including through stringent eligibility requirements while
respecting the sanctity of contracts and all such mechanisms should be subject to adequate
safeguards. Staff expressed similar concerns about the forced conversion of foreign-currency
denominated loans being considered in parliament that would also entail a retroactive change in
contracts. In this regard, the authorities should also revisit some elements of existing legislation on
abusive clauses in order to dispel another important source of uncertainty, while securing fairness
for all stakeholders. Finally, staff recommended

A key medium term challenge is to raise
financial intermediation to better serve growth
needs. Romania has one of the lowest ratios of
private credit to GDP in the region and relatively
moderate levels of corporate and household debt.
Staff analysis suggests that both supply and
demand factors have been at play since the 2008
global financial crisis.4 More recently, non-financial
corporations’ indicators point to some improvement
in liquidity and profitability ratios and household
incomes have been on the rise. Nonetheless, raising
intermediation is important to help support
investment and will require Romania to boost
domestic deposits and develop alternative sources

recently adopted new covered bond law should contribute to the development of long-term bank
funding and intermediation, albeit the “Giving in payment” law enforcement may jeopardize covered
bonds issuance. Sustaining the recent progress in NPL reduction will support banks’ ability to cater
to credit demand. Results of the ongoing asset quality review would be helpful in this regard to
identify the scope of further effort needed in this area.

Significant progress has been made on restructuring the Financial Supervisory
Authority (FSA) and strengthening its intervention and resolution tools. This should help
address challenges in the insurance sector. The FSA recently implemented comprehensive balance
sheet reviews and stress testing exercises which covered virtually the whole insurance sector. The
balance sheet reviews revealed a number of deficiencies including capital shortfalls in several
insurance companies. The largest insurance company entered bankruptcy in late 2015, while another
major insurance company is currently under resolution. Staff welcomed recent progress to
strengthen the FSA, including the adoption of recent legislation that strengthens its intervention and
resolution tools, and encouraged it to address the revealed shortfalls to ensure adequate
capitalization in the insurance sector.
Authorities’ views
34.
The authorities broadly agreed with staff’s views. They shared staff’s concerns regarding
the potential impact of harmful legislative initiatives and mentioned additional capital buffers as a
possible contingency measure. They expressed commitment to further improve the quality of
financial intermediaries’ portfolios and ensure that both bank and non-bank financial institutions
hold adequate capital. They also agreed that increasing financial intermediation is an important
objective for the medium term including through promoting capital market development.

STAFF APPRAISAL
35.
Romania made important progress in reducing vulnerabilities after the global financial
crisis but the recent weakening of policies puts the gains at risk. The fiscal and current account
16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ROMANIA

deficits have improved markedly since the global financial crisis and banks’ loan portfolio quality has
strengthened. Stronger policies and fundamentals have helped Romania achieve robust growth and
avoid pressures from elevated market volatility. It is important that sound policies and reforms
continue to sustain strong and inclusive growth, at a time that downside risks have increased.
36.
Fiscal policy needs to put public debt on a downward trajectory. Romania achieved
impressive fiscal consolidation since 2009—one of the largest amongst peers. However, the large
fiscal relaxation approved last year provides stimulus when consumption growth is already strong. If
no further measures are taken, next year’s fiscal deficit will likely breach the EU’s excessive deficit
procedure (EDP) threshold. Even if the deficit is kept at the authorities’ cash budget target of
2.8 percent of GDP (3 percent in ESA terms), public debt will exceed 40 percent of GDP and continue
to gradually rise. Instead, gradual adjustment to reduce the cash deficit to 1½ percent of GDP by
2018 will help keep debt on a downward path. Postponing the tax reductions scheduled to come
into effect in 2017 will help achieve this goal.
37.
More broadly, the credibility of fiscal institutions should be strengthened. The waiving
of the provisions of the FRL and the fiscal rule undermines the credibility of the policy framework
and the budget process. In this regard, it is important that the work of the Fiscal Council is
integrated better into decision making.
38.
Reforms should be accelerated to make public administration more efficient and
transparent. These reforms include further progress in prioritization of public investment projects,
fully operationalizing the recently created spending review unit, strengthening targeting of social
protection schemes, extending centralized procurement to generate savings, and passage of the
public procurement law. Recent efforts to enhance transparency of spending of public entities are
welcome and should help to improve accountability and efficiency of public spending. Early passage
of legislation on natural resource taxation will help to give certainty on the tax framework.
39.
Continued structural reform efforts are needed to improve public and private
investment and raise potential growth. The efficiency of public investment in critical infrastructure
sectors can be enhanced by strengthening the corporate governance of SOEs—including through
the passage of draft legislation in parliament—and better planning and utilization of EU funds. The
tax administration agency should focus more on high revenue potential tax payers while becoming
more business friendly. Reforms need to focus on taxpayers’ single window, electronic filing,
consolidation of small taxes, online centralized taxpayers’ database, and improving promptness of
VAT refunds.
40.
There has been welcome progress in the fight against corruption and more needs to
be done. Improving governance and the fight against corruption are not only key socio-economic
issues, they are also macro-relevant in Romania. The anticorruption agency enjoys growing public
confidence and efforts in this direction should be sustained.
41.
Policies for public and minimum wages should take into account fiscal space and
competitiveness considerations. On public sector wages, there is a need to eliminate the

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

ROMANIA

distortions in the remuneration system. Current budget plans do not provide fiscal space for the
unified wage law that would help address these distortions. Postponement of the 2017 tax
reductions would provide space for the phased implementation of this law. On minimum wage,
moderating the pace of future increases will help balance social considerations with
competitiveness, productivity growth, and employment prospects.
42.
A tightening bias in monetary policy is warranted on current inflation projections.
Inflation projections have risen to the upper bound of the variation band of the central bank’s
inflation target on account of a closing output gap, sharp wage increases, and the fiscal stimulus.
While the policy rate can be left unchanged until projected inflation moves more clearly above
target, the NBR should begin to reduce the gap between the market and policy rates by absorbing
liquidity from the market and narrowing the interest rate corridor. Interventions in the foreign
exchange market should be limited to smoothing excessive volatility.
43.
There has been important progress in reducing NPLs and threats to financial stability
need to be guarded against. Sustained efforts towards reducing NPLs are welcome. Removing
provisions in legislative initiatives that could undermine financial stability and legal predictability,
and finding better ways to target relief to distressed borrowers, will mitigate risks. Increasing
financial intermediation while maintaining financial sector stability will support growth needs.
44.

It is recommended to hold the next Article IV consultation on the standard 12-month

cycle.

Box 1. Romania’s Recent Anticorruption Campaign
Corruption issues are highly macro-relevant in Romania. They affect three areas in particular:
government revenues, government expenditure, and competitiveness and FDI.
i) Corruption undermines government revenue. It can lead to foregone tax revenue, as evidenced for
example by Romania’s VAT gap being the largest in the EU. Corruption is also associated with larger
unofficial activity. The size of the shadow economy in Romania was estimated to be 28 percent of GDP in
2014, which is the second highest percentage in the EU. A large shadow economy leads to reduced state
revenues which in turn reduce the quality and quantity of goods and services publicly provided.
ii) Corruption can lead to a suboptimal composition of government expenditure. It induces government
officials to choose expenditure on the basis of opportunities for inflating spending and obtaining more rents
instead of public welfare. Thus, it can bloat the budget for domestically financed capital spending with low
effectiveness as shown by the slow pace of infrastructure deployment (see the 2015 Selected Issues Papers).
Public procurement represents an important share of the Romanian economy. Public works, goods and
services constituted about 12 percent of GDP in Romania in 2015 and, as shown by a number of external
audits, there is still a general perception of high levels of corruption. The deficient application of public
procurement rules triggers substantial financial corrections and contributes to a low absorption of EU funds.
As highlighted by the EU anticorruption report, businesses report a number of widespread practices,
including the involvement of bidders in the design of proposal specifications, conflicts of interest in the
evaluation of bids, specifications being tailor made for particular companies, and the abuse of
noncompetitive or fast-track procedures. There is a high perception that public funds are being diverted and
frequent experiences of irregular payments and bribes. An earlier World Bank survey showed that state
sector entities with better systems of public administration tended to have lower levels of corruption.
iii) Finally, corruption depresses foreign direct investment and is a key obstacle to Romania’s
competitiveness. Corruption is one of the top three obstacles for doing business in the World Bank’s and
EBRD’s Business Environment and Enterprise Performance survey. At a cross-country level several studies
have demonstrated the negative effects of corruption on growth. Ugur (2014) shows that corruption has a
negative effect on per-capita GDP growth, even after controlling for possible biases in the underlying
empirical analyses. Ugur and Dasgupta (2011) find that a one-unit improvement in the perceived
corruption index can lead to an increase of 0.59 to

0.86 percentage-points in the growth rate of per-capita
GDP, depending on the sample of countries analyzed.

Romania has recently been recognized for its

sustained. The country’s anticorruption agency (DNA)
has increasingly been recognized by international
agencies and in international media for its fights
against corruption. In its most recent assessment
released in January 2016, the EC described the “track

address high-level corruption has remained impressive.”

Box 1. Romania’s Recent Anticorruption Campaign (concluded)
In the course of 2015 alone, DNA indicted over 1,250 defendants, and this included the prime minister,
former ministers, members of parliament, mayors, presidents of county councils, judges, prosecutors and a
wide variety of senior officials. It has also increased its interim asset freezing measures relating to these
cases, to reach a figure of €452 million. Anecdotal reports suggest that one reason behind last year’s
investment under-spending was fear of being caught in the recent anticorruption effort. Public confidence in
the institution has jumped, as also reflected in opinion polls.
Romania needs to do more in its anticorruption fight and sustaining recent momentum will have big
payoffs. The most recent CVM report stressed that while there have been steps to tackle general corruption,
further consolidation of reform is needed to ensure the irreversibility of progress. The report suggests
strengthening of prevention and control mechanisms with regard to public procurement and public
contracts, including in state-owned companies, as well as strengthening safeguards when it comes to
allocation of public funding. Similarly, in its January 2016 Report, the Council of Europe’s Group of States
against Corruption (GRECO) commended the country’s progress in enhancing the anticorruption framework.
It nevertheless recommended several anticorruption measures, including the provision of a transparent
system for lifting parliamentary immunity for corruption investigations, establishment of conflicts of interest
rules for parliamentarians, and strengthening the National Integrity Agency’s capabilities to monitor asset
declarations. Finally, ensuring that the AML/CFT regime with respect to domestic politically exposed persons
is in line with the international standard and effectively implementing AML/CFT tools could also support
efforts to prevent, deter and detect laundering of corruption proceeds.
Making progress on anticorruption will directly support many of the Fund’s policy recommendations
and, vice versa, many of the Fund’s policy recommendations will help with the anticorruption efforts.
Anticorruption and, more broadly governance, is an overarching issue that would support progress in many
of the Fund’s recommendations. It would support spending efficiency, particularly in the health and
education sectors, as discussed in the accompanying Selected Issues Paper. Adopting procurement reform
will similarly go hand in hand with the anticorruption efforts. The Fund’s recommendations for a unified
wage law would help reduce the incentives of public employees to seek compensation through corruption.
Improving the corporate governance of the SOE sector would help reduce a big source of patronage,
improve efficiency, and allow saved public resources to be used elsewhere. Finally, bringing tax evaders in
the tax net will allow the government to reduce the pro-cyclicality of the budget, help resume the deficit
reducing trend, and raise the incentive of those already in the tax net to contribute their share.

Box 2. Debt Discharge (Giving in Payment) Law
The Romanian banking sector faces risks associated with potentially harmful legislative initiatives that allow unilateral and
retroactive change of contracts. One such initiative is the law on the discharge of debt obligations assumed through credit
agreements through the transfer of mortgaged property (“Giving in Payment” law). The law was first approved by the
parliament in November 2015; however, President Iohannis sent the bill back to the parliament for reconsideration. In
April 2016 the parliament approved the law in a final vote.
The “Giving in Payment” law contains a number of controversial provisions that could be potentially detrimental
to the economy. While the law was presented as a measure to help distressed households with mortgages, Romanian
banks and the NBR have argued that some of the provisions can create legal uncertainties and moral hazard and may
pose systemic risk to banks. The law permits consumers as well as their co-debtors and pledgors meeting the following
criteria to discharge their loans in entirety through the transfer of the collateral to the creditors: (i) the loan is less than
250,000 euros at origination; (ii) the loan is collateralized by residential real property; and (iii) the creditors are credit
institutions, non-bank financial institutions or their assignees. Should the right be exercised by the debtor, the creditor
would no longer have recourse to any other assets or income of the debtor beyond the pledged collateral in case of any
deficiency claim. The law applies not only to new loans but also to existing ones, including in situations where property
was foreclosed in the past or foreclosure proceedings are ongoing. It does not specify any other economic or other
eligibility criteria for borrowers and does not appear to take into account the borrower’s ability to pay. The ECB noted
that the draft law introduces unprecedented changes into the legal framework applicable to credit agreements in
Romania and will significantly undermine legal certainty and the adequate management of credit risk in financial
1
institutions. The EC in its latest country report on Romania has also expressed major concerns including regarding the
retroactive applicability of the law.
The application of the law may lead to substantial losses for banks and undermine payment culture and future
access to credit. While it is hard to provide reliable

amount the banks would have to write-off (the
write-offs would be smaller by the amount of provisions for overdue loans but such data was not available). In addition,
there may be “underwater mortgage” cases where borrowers who are still current on their payments, and have the ability
to continue making payments, may choose to use the provisions of the “Giving in Payment” law to receive a discharge of
any deficiency claim and transfer the entire collateral risk to the bank. A hypothetical assumption of 20 percent of total
loans being loans where borrowers decide to take advantage of the law because they have “underwater mortgages”
would add RON 8 billion to the amount of possible write-offs. Thus, the amount of potential write-offs could be in the
range of RON 5–13 billion. Applying a further assumption that the banks incur a loss of 25 percent of the loan value
when they sell the underlying immovable property, the overall loss to banks could be in the range of RON 1.3–3.3 billion
(up to 4 percent of commercial banks total capital). These estimates could be higher if there is significant use of “Giving
in Payment” law. The banks will also incur additional operational expenses in order to manage and sell the portfolio of
immovable property that they will take on their balance sheets. Besides the direct impact of the law on bank balance
sheets, a key negative spillover from the law would be that it could undermine future credit expansion and investor
confidence by making the legal framework less predictable. There are also risks that contingent liabilities are created for
the state in case banks go to courts and claim compensation from the Romanian state.

Annex I. Implementation of the 2015 Article IV Key
Recommendations
Key Recommendations

Policy Actions
Fiscal

Maintain fiscal adjustment achievements and put
public debt as a share of GDP on a downward
path

2015 fiscal deficit lower than targeted and public debt as
a share of GDP declined, but 2016 budget envisages a
substantially higher deficit raising the public debt ratio.

Improve revenue administration

Several administrative measures implemented that have
strengthened tax collection (compared to a weak base
though). Nonetheless, tax collection gap remains
substantial.

Improve public expenditure management
including through higher EU funds absorption

Tighter scrutiny of the selection of domestically financed
investment projects and higher EU funds absorption,
though far less than envisaged. Limited progress toward
better investment planning and execution.

Monetary and financial
Maintain easing bias and improve monetary
policy framework

Policy eased throughout 2015. Interest rate corridor
around policy rate narrowed, interventions in the foreign
exchange market became more limited, and during last
months of the year exchange rate became more flexible.

Continue intense watch on the banking and
insurance sectors with a focus on better
assessment of asset quality

Implemented a balance sheet review of major insurance
companies. Initiated process to conduct an asset quality
review for major banks. Continued close bank supervision.

Create effective insolvency frameworks

Personal insolvency law adopted but enforcement
delayed by one year amid lack of development of
effective secondary legislation and institutions.

Reduce non-performing loans (NPL)

Continued efforts towards further NPL reduction and a
sharp recent reduction in the NPL ratio.
Structural reforms

Further deregulate energy markets

Implemented the gas price deregulation for nonresidential consumers. Continued implementation of
electricity market deregulation.

Improve financial performance of state-owned
enterprise (SOE) sector through better
governance and restructuring

Improvement in overall financial situation, albeit to varying
degrees across the sector. Weak implementation of the
SOE corporate governance law. Strengthened legislation
prepared in line with IFIs recommendations still to be
adopted.

Increase private ownership in SOEs

Pursuit of majority privatization attempts of SOEs and
initial public offerings unsuccessful.

Annex III. Debt Sustainability Analysis
Public debt in Romania is relatively low, but the recent partial reversal in fiscal adjustment exposes the
fiscal position to risks. Under the baseline scenario, with deficit assumed to remain just below 3 percent
of GDP, debt would moderately increase to reach slightly above 42 percent in 2021. However, the
recent experience of Romania leading up to the 2008 crisis shows that a large pro-cyclical relaxation in
fiscal balance could deteriorate substantially the debt dynamics. Moreover, the shock analysis shows
that an adverse combination of macroeconomic shocks could bring the debt above the 60 percent
threshold of the Stability and Growth Pact though below the 70 percent of GDP DSA benchmark.
Finally, exchange rate volatility and exposure to international capital outflows are also risks, in
consideration of the large share of foreign currency denominated debt and significant share of nonresident holders. Risks from known contingent liabilities are contained, since all outstanding
guarantees are already included in public debt and banks are well capitalized and with limited
exposure to short-term external debt. The external debt sustainability analysis indicates that the
projected current account deficits remain sustainable.

Public Debt
1.

The macroeconomic and fiscal assumptions underpinning the DSA are those of the

medium-term baseline scenario. The output gap is expected to be slightly positive in 2016–18 and
to be closed by 2021. Real growth would be close to 4 percent in 2016 and would stabilize at slightly
above 3 percent afterwards. The fiscal balance is projected to deteriorate from 1.5 percent in 2015
to 2.8 percent (in cash terms; close to 3 percent in ESA terms) in 2016 and to remain close to
3 percent afterwards up until 2021. Under this scenario, Romania would not comply with the fiscal
rules under the Fiscal Compact, but would conform to the 3 percent rule under the Stability and
Growth Pact. Analysis of forecasts errors indicates that the size of the output contraction and of the
fiscal deficit was underestimated during the crisis and the following slow recovery. More recently,
growth projections were slightly pessimistic, while the forecast errors in the fiscal balance were
broadly within the error band (interquartile range). Reflecting the deficit deterioration in 2016 and
the projected flat path of the fiscal balance going forward, the three years average level of the
cyclically adjusted primary balance in 2016 is slightly negative, while the maximum adjustment over
a three-year horizon starting from 2016 is close to zero. Both are well below the 25 percentile
benchmarks and suggest that baseline assumptions are realistic.
2.

Public debt is relatively low, but the share in foreign currency is relatively high. Public

debt, including guarantees, is estimated at 39.3 percent of GDP in 2015. It is projected to increase to

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

41

ROMANIA

about 42 percent by 2021. Gross financing needs are projected to remain rather stable at about
8 percent of GDP over the projection horizon. To manage some of the financing risk, the authorities
maintain a foreign currency financing buffer (excluding privatization proceeds), which is about
3.3 percent of GDP or almost five months of gross financing needs. Most of longer-term debt is
official financing while the average maturity of government securities issued on the domestic market
is about three years. The authorities have been addressing rollover risks under their debt
management strategy with a view to issuing longer-term securities as well as lengthening the yield
curve. With foreign currency denominated debt accounting for about 55 percent of public debt,
public debt is also exposed to exchange rate risk. Moreover, non-residents share in domestic debt
securities holdings is about 20 percent.
3.

Overall, public debt is sustainable but there is a risk it will rise above 60 percent under

adverse scenarios. The stress test scenarios indicate that weaker GDP growth could push the debt
ratio to 55 percent of GDP by 2021. A combination of adverse macro shocks could push the debt
above 60 percent threshold of the Stability and Growth Pact by 2020. Barring unexpected events,
potential contingent liabilities of the government would be limited. SOE debt is estimated at around
7.5 percent of GDP (including SOEs under insolvency procedures). Despite remaining vulnerabilities
of the banking system, including due to a large share of foreign currency denominated loans and
high rollover needs, downside risks are contained as banks are generally well capitalized and their
short-term external liabilities are below 4 percent of GDP.

External Debt
4.

The projected medium-term current account deficit of 3.5 percent of GDP is in line

with a declining external debt-to-GDP ratio. The current account deficit adjusted remarkably
since the global financial crisis, from 11.8 percent of GDP in 2008 to 1.1 percent of GDP in 2015,
primarily on the back of strong exports (both goods and services) and import compression.
However, the deficit is expected to widen gradually owing to increase in imports as the economy
recovers. The current account deficit in the last two years was financed by a combination of private
and public inflows. Going forward, FDI inflows are likely to steadily improve as the economy grows
and will contribute partly towards financing the current account deficit. External debt has been on a
downtrend since 2012 due to the decline in private external liabilities, partly reflecting deleveraging
in the banking sector. Going forward, the external debt as a share of GDP is expected to rise in 2016
by 2 percentage points, mainly due to the increase in private debt, but then gradually fall from 2017.

42

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ROMANIA

5.

The external debt sustainability analysis indicates that the projected current account

deficits remain sustainable. Gross external debt, at 56.7 percent of GDP at end-2015, was
6.4 percentage points below 2014. The improvement was due to the fall in both public and private
sector debt. Around one-third of the external debt stock was public debt. Almost one-fifth of
external debt was at short-term maturities, mainly of the non-bank sector. Short-term financing risk
for non-bank private sector is expected to be limited, as a substantial portion of the short-term debt
is intra-company loans with relatively low rollover risks.
6.

Romania could be vulnerable in the medium term if negative global market sentiment,

induced by a broader emerging markets slowdown and/or oil price decline, leads to sharp
currency depreciation. Bound tests indicate a 30 percent currency depreciation shock would
substantially increase the external debt-to-GDP ratio over the medium term. However, other
standard shocks would only lead to a slower decline in the external debt-to-GDP ratio.

red if benchmark is exceeded under baseline, white if stress test is not relevant.
2/ The cell is highlighted in green if gross financing needs benchmark of 15% is not exceeded under the specific shock or baseline, yellow if exceeded under specific shock but not
baseline, red if benchmark is exceeded under baseline, white if stress test is not relevant.
3/ The cell is highlighted in green if country value is less than the lower risk-assessment benchmark, red if country value exceeds the upper risk-assessment benchmark, yellow if
country value is between the lower and upper risk-assessment benchmarks. If data are unavailable or indicator is not relevant, cell is white.
Lower and upper risk-assessment benchmarks are:
200 and 600 basis points for bond spreads; 5 and 15 percent of GDP for external financing requirement; 0.5 and 1 percent for change in the share of short-term debt; 15 and 45
percent for the public debt held by non-residents; and 20 and 60 percent for the share of foreign-currency denominated debt.
4/ EMBIG, an average over the last 3 months, 30-Dec-15 through 29-Mar-16.
5/ External financing requirement is defined as the sum of current account deficit, amortization of medium and long-term total external debt, and short-term total external debt at
the end of previous period.

1/ Public sector is defined as general government and includes public guarantees, defined as .
2/ Based on available data.
3/ EMBIG.
4/ Defined as interest payments divided by debt stock (excluding guarantees) at the end of previous year.
5/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;
a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
6/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
7/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as ae(1+r).
8/ Includes changes in the stock of guarantees, asset changes, and interest revenues (if any). For projections, includes exchange rate changes during the projection period.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

level of 25 percent of GDP). The current account deficit has modestly deteriorated last year, primarily
due to the increase in goods deficit and the almost doubling of primary income deficit. The Fund’s
recently developed EBA-lite tool1 estimates that a cyclically-adjusted CA norm of -3.0 percent of
GDP is consistent with medium-term fundamentals. The estimated CA gap of 2.0 percent includes
policy gap of 0.9 percent, mainly due to the fiscal gap in the rest of the world. The EBA-lite model
does not completely capture the temporary factors responsible for the sharp adjustment of the
current account in Romania since 2007. The large compression in imports and the strong exports
since 2007 is likely to be partly temporary and reverse to some extent, and the current account
deficit is expected to gradually widen to 3.5 percent in the medium term. Hence, staff assesses that
1

The External Assessment (EBA) methodology has been developed by IMF as a successor to the former CGER
exercise. There are two important differences. First, EBA makes a sharper distinction between positive (descriptive)
understanding of current accounts and real exchange rates and making normative evaluations. Second, EBA takes
into account a much broader set of factors—including policies, cyclical conditions, and global capital market
conditions—that may influence the current account and real exchange rate. For more details, see “The External
Balance Assessment (EBA) Methodology,” IMF Working Paper, WP/13/272. EBA-Lite model has been developed using
the same methodology for countries not included in EBA. For more details, see “Methodological Note on EBA-Lite” at
http://www.imf.org/external/pp/longres.aspx?id=5017.

the cyclically-adjusted CA, removing all temporary factors predominantly related to imports, would
be around -2 percent of GDP, implying that the underlying cyclically-adjusted current account deficit
is lower than the cyclically-adjusted norm.2
3.

Real Exchange Rate. The real exchange rate has depreciated by around 4 percent in 2015.

Assuming that exchange rate changes would be the primary driver for a current account adjustment,
the EBA-Lite CA model estimates that an appreciation of around 8 percent would be needed to
close the gap between the underlying cyclically-adjusted current account and the norm. However,
staff assessment, incorporating the temporary factors in the current level of the cyclically-adjusted
current account, implies that an appreciation of around 4 percent of the currency would be required
to close the CA gap. The EBA-Lite REER index model suggests a modest undervaluation of 2 percent,
while the EBA-Lite External Sustainability Approach suggests an undervaluation of around
3.6 percent. Overall, staff assesses that the real exchange rate is broadly in line with its equilibrium
level. However, caution is needed to ensure that the recent wage pressure, an average increase of
8 percent in 2015, due to the rise in public wages and minimum wages do not undermine
competitiveness.
4.

Reserve Adequacy. Reserve coverage in Romania is broadly adequate according to most

reserve adequacy metrics. The reserve level of
€35.5 billion at end-December 2015 was above the
level recommended by the standard rules of thumb
(three months coverage of prospective imports and
20 percent of broad money). It was also in line with
the new reserve adequacy metric for emerging
markets developed by Fund staff. Reserves fell slightly
short of the 100 percent short-term debt (at
remaining maturity) benchmark, but this metric has
improved recently due to the reduction in short-term

external liabilities. Nevertheless, in light of continued downside external risks, a prudent stance with
moderate reserve accumulation remains appropriate.

2

The EBA-lite model includes two variables to capture temporary components of the CA (the output gap and
temporary terms of trade changes), but in some instances these may not capture other temporary phenomena. The
contraction in investment/imports during and after crises is generally much larger than what can be explained by
linear specifications for the output gaps.

Annex V. Fiscal Institutions
1.

Romania’s national and sub-national fiscal rules follow the EU model. In 2013, the 2010

Fiscal Responsibility Law (FRL) was amended in line with EU requirements to include structural fiscal
targets and specify corrective actions in case of deviations. Currently, the MTO for Romania is
1 percent of GDP deficit, to be achieved through structural annual adjustments of 0.5 percent of
GDP. Also following EC provisions, the annual increase of expenditures should not exceed the
projected nominal GDP growth for the next three years until the budget balance is in surplus. Public
debt should not exceed 60 percent of GDP. Municipalities’ budgets, excluding loans to finance
investment and debt refinancing, have to be balanced. Municipalities cannot contract or guarantee
loans if their annual public debt service (principal payment, interest, and commissions) including the
loan they want to contract, is higher than 30 percent of their own revenue.
2.

A Fiscal Council was established in mid-2010. This was one of the main objectives of the

2010 FRL. The council issues opinions and recommendations on official macroeconomic and
budgetary forecasts, the annual budget laws, and assesses the compliance of the medium-term
fiscal strategy with the principles and rules specified in the FRL.

On paper, Romania’s fiscal rules fare well in comparison with the rest of the EU. The EC

periodically assesses the quality of European countries’ fiscal rules. The last available assessment was
done in 2014 and it is organized around five main indicators for both the local and the general
governments (figure): (i) the legal basis of the rule (such as constitution or law); (ii) the room for
revising the objectives; (iii) the institutions in charge of enforcement, monitoring and alerting (such
as independent authority or the parliament); (iv) the enforcement mechanisms (such as an automatic
sanction mechanism in case of non-compliance); and (v) media visibility (triggering public debate).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

53

ROMANIA

Based on these indicators, the general government rules fare well on the whole. At the local level,
enforcement mechanisms and media visibility are area with margins for improvement.
4.

However, the actual enforcement of the rules is weak. The fiscal rules have been

repeatedly circumvented in the recent past. A recent example of non-compliance relates to the 2016
budget law that breaches the fiscal rule but contained specific provisions to waive the FRL (in this
way also avoiding triggering the automatic sanctions foreseen by the FRL). The effectiveness of the
rules should be strengthened through increasing the public awareness of the rules, ensuring proper
tracking of risk of breaching them, and strengthening automatic sanctions to incentivize responsible
parties to apply the rules.

below the target in 2014 before entering the negative territory in June 2015.

were oil and food price developments, but
especially the recent reduction in the VAT
rate. Three episodes of a noticeable fall in
inflation can be identified. The first in mid-2013
was largely due to lower food prices following an
abundant harvest and a reduction in VAT on
some food products. The second episode, since
autumn 2014, was mainly the result of declining

nevertheless incorporating lower international food and energy prices—has been rising in recent
months and reached 2.3 percent in December 2015 (HICP at constant tax, Eurostat estimate). Based
on the latest projections by the NBR, underlying inflation is projected to reach 3.7 percent by end2017. So far, consensus forecasts for 2017 and 2018 have stayed close to the target.
4.

Going forward, a number of domestic factors point to a potential buildup of

inflationary pressure that should be carefully monitored. The output gap is projected to turn
positive this year, as the Romanian economic growth is set to accelerate; wage pressure is growing,
following the announced, large-scale upward adjustment in minimum wages and public wages;
moreover, the fiscal impulse of about 2 percent of GDP is likely to drive up inflation expectations.
Besides the pressures from demand factors, inflation is expected to rise as a number of supply
shocks would likely reverse or phase out over the next 12 months.

Annex VII. Minimum Wage Policy in Romania
1.

Minimum wage policy in Romania has been increasingly active in recent years.

Minimum wages will be raised in May 2016, resulting in about 78.6 percent increase compared to
end-2012. Minimum wage in Romania also showed the sharpest rise among EU countries, although
the increase could partly indicate the progressive convergence with peers. With the planned
increase in 2016, the minimum wage in Romania would leap to approximately 45.3 percent of mean
wage and 65.4 percent of median wage which is high by international standards. In 2013, there were
approximately 430,000 workers in Romania with wages at or below the minimum wage, accounting
for about 11.2 percent of total workers registered. Minimum wage workers are largely concentrated
in construction, trade, manufacturing, hotels and restaurants. The majority of these workers are
among working-age group and about two-thirds of minimum wage workers are male. There was
only 0.5 percent of government employees who received minimum wage in 2013, and a large
increase in public sector wage in 2016 would lift the monthly salary for all government employees
above the minimum wage.
2.

The increase in minimum wage is aimed at reducing poverty. The Romanian government

introduced the active minimum wage policy as part of measures to tackle poverty as committed in
the Europe strategy 2020. A rise in minimum wage would reduce the number of low-paid workers—
the share of workers at or below the minimum wage rose to 11.3 percent after the first hike in 2013,
from around 4 percent in 2012. However, minimum wage is a poorly targeted instrument and may
not be effective in reducing poverty as the effects would depend largely on the extent to which the
population of minimum wage earners and that of the working poor are overlapped (IMF Country
Report No. 14/221 and OCED (2015)).
3.

Sharp increases in minimum wage may nevertheless have undesirable economic

effects. Several studies find that high minimum wage to gross average wage ratio could undermine
external competitiveness and export performance, while hampering potential foreign direct
investment that could benefit low-skilled labor. Minimum wage is, in principle, a wage floor. If the
floor is set too high, it could affect firms’ profitability and discourage employers from hiring. Studies
generally find negative labor demand elasticity to the change in minimum wage, particularly among
young or low-skilled workers. But, the net effect on the total employment may be varied, depending
on the overall economic conditions and labor market structures across countries. Sharp and sudden
minimum wage increases are more often associated with sizeable employment effects, particularly if
the initial level of minimum to average wage ratio is already at high level.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

57

ROMANIA

4.

Future decisions on minimum wage need to be carefully crafted. The International Labor

Organization (ILO) Convention on Minimum Wage Fixing (1970) suggests several elements to be
taken into consideration in determining the level of minimum wages: (a) the needs of workers and
their families and (b) economic factors including the requirements of economic development, levels
of productivity and the desirability of attaining and maintaining a high level of employment.
Minimum wage in Romania is determined at the national level by the government after consulting
trade unions and employers’ organizations. As minimum-to-average wage ratios in Romania are
already higher than its peers, the economic effects could weigh on Romania’s perceived
competitiveness in the region. Hence, future minimum wage adjustments could usefully be based on
a transparent and clear mechanism and avoid unsustainably rapid increases to avoid adverse effects.
Finally, periodic assessments of the impact of labor market policy including minimum wages by
labor market expert committees could usefully inform future policy decisions.

Article IV Consultations
Romania is on a 12-month consultation cycle. The previous Article IV consultation was concluded by
the Executive Board on March 25, 2015.
Safeguards Assessment
An update of the 2011 safeguards assessment, completed on January 10, 2014, found that overall
governance at the NBR remains robust, although the legal framework is in need of update to
strengthen the NBR’s financial autonomy. Accountability and transparency practices are strong;
annual financial statements are independently audited and published. Robust controls are
maintained over foreign reserves management, government banking, and vault operations. Romania
fully repaid the Fund on January 11, 2016 and therefore will no longer be subject to monitoring
under the safeguards policy.

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK
The current World Bank Group Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Romania, covering the period
2014–17, was presented to the Board on May 22, 2014. The strategy aims at reducing poverty and
promoting shared prosperity. The CPS is built on three pillars: (i) Creating a 21st Century
Government, with focus on a well-functioning public administration, effective in its service delivery
and with an improved quality of public expenditure; (ii) Growth and Private Sector Job Creation,
seeking sustainable poverty mitigation and shared prosperity through improvements in the business
environment and SOE governance (especially in energy and transport), promoting innovation, and
furthering the digital agenda and competitiveness; and (iii) Social Inclusion, a key to the EU’s Europe
2020 Agenda, with a special focus on the Roma community.
i.

International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)

Romania’s portfolio consists of six active investment projects that amount to US$1.6 billion and one
Development Policy Loan (DPL), which are complemented by four country-executed trust funds over
US$10 million and 11 (Bank-funded) analytical pieces. The ongoing five Reimbursable Advisory
Services (RAS) are worth US$12.29 million and support the Roma Education Fund, the Chancellery of
the Prime Minister, the Ministry of Education and National Agency of Public Procurement. Since
2010, 47 RAS agreements totaling US$75.75 million have been signed.


The six active investment projects include the recently approved Additional Financing for
Integrated Nutrient Pollution Control (US$120.5 million), the Romania Secondary Education
Project (US$243 million), the Health Sector Reform Project (US$339 million), the Results-Based
Project for Social Assistance System Modernization (US$710 million), a Judicial Reform Project
(US$130 million), and a Revenue Administration Modernization Project (US$92 million).



The Second Fiscal Effectiveness and Growth DPL is the only loan under preparation for approval
by the Bank’s Board of Directors in FY2017. It is the second DPL in a programmatic series of two,
which supports structural reforms in the areas of: cash and debt management; centralized
procurement for health; public investment prioritization; SOE corporate governance; social
assistance; energy; cadaster; and capital markets.



The country-executed trust funds focus on (i) afforestation; (ii) nutrients pollution control;
(iii) policymaking for people with disabilities; and (iv) strengthening financial accountability.



The Bank advisory services program covers key areas of engagement. Under the programming
period 2007–13, the Bank has been providing guidance on policy formulation and strategy
development in agriculture, competition, climate change, early school leaving, tertiary education,
life-long learning, active ageing, social inclusion, Roma integration and transport. Among the 47
RAS that have been signed since 2010, a few provided support to the government in improving
the public sector management for efficient and effective service delivery by: (i) shifting towards a
results-driven culture, improved policy prioritization, implementation, and coordination,
(ii) strengthening public investment management, (iii) introducing performance management

Analytical work (Bank-funded ASA) provides diagnostics and policy recommendations in key
areas and stimulate cross sector synergy. Typical examples are the Public Expenditure Reviews
and Financial Sector Assessments. Other ASAs delivered in the past include Rural Land
Registration, Irrigation Prioritization, Roads Safety, Partnerships for Marginalized Roma, and
Decentralization.
International Finance Corporation (IFC)

Since the start of operations in Romania in 1990 through FY2015, IFC has invested approximately
US$2.5 billion in long-term finance in 81 projects, including US$556 million in mobilization. As of
February 29, 2016, IFC’s Committed Portfolio stood at US$565 million (US$463 million outstanding).
At present, Romania is IFC’s fourth-largest country exposure in the Central and Eastern Europe
region after Turkey, Russia, and Ukraine, accounting for 1.2 percent of its outstanding global
portfolio. IFC has played an active crisis response role in Romania. From FY2009 to FY2014, IFC
invested approximately US$933 million of its own funds and mobilized an additional US$277 million
in 30 projects in various sectors. Particular support was provided to the financial, renewable energy,
and health sectors.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
As of January 14, 2016
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is adequate for surveillance. The quality of the national accounts, price,
fiscal, and balance of payments data is adequate.
National accounts: Quarterly and annual national accounts statistics are produced by the National
Institute for Statistics (INS) using the European System of Accounts 2010 (ESA 2010). Estimates are
methodologically sound and are reported to the Fund on a timely basis for publication in the
International Financial Statistics (IFS). Provisional and semi-final versions are disseminated in the
Statistical Yearbook and other publications, as well as on the web (www.insse.ro).
Prices: The Consumer Price Index is subject to standard annual reweighting, and is considered
reliable. In January 2004, the INS changed the coverage of the Producer Price Index to include the
domestic and export sectors.
Labor market: Labor market statistics are broadly adequate. The definition used for employment
is consistent with ESA 2010.
Public finances: Annual GFS data for the general government sector, including public
corporations operating on a non-market basis, are reported on an accrual basis derived from cash
data using various adjustment methods. Tax revenues are adjusted using the time-adjusted cash
6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ROMANIA

method; expense data are adjusted using due-for-payments data; and interest payments are
calculated on an accrual basis. Accrual data are also available on a quarterly basis three months
after the end of each quarter. EUR receives monthly cash budget execution data. Consolidated
data on general government operations are reported for inclusion in the GFS Yearbook.
Monetary and financial statistics: The National Bank of Romania (NBR) reports monetary and
financial statistics on a monthly basis for publication in the IFS. Since December 2004, the NBR
reports monetary data to STA using the Standardized Report Forms (SRFs), including data for
Other Financial Corporations (OFCs). The data are published beginning September 2006.
Financial Soundness Indicators (FSIs): The NBR reports all core and most encouraged FSIs for
Deposit Takers on a quarterly basis, beginning in 2010 Quarter 1. In addition, the NBR reports FSIs
for the nonfinancial corporations (NFCs) and households (HHs) sectors, as well as those concerning
real estate markets.
Balance of payments: The NBR routinely reports quarterly and annual external sector statistics to
the Fund in a timely fashion. Since September 2014 the authorities implemented the sixth edition
of the Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual (BPM6), in line with other
European countries. Romania also participates in the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment
Survey (CPIS) and Coordinated Direct Investment Survey (CDIS).
II. Data Standards and Quality
Romania is a subscriber to the Fund’s Special
Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) since
August 4, 2005.

IMF Reports on the Observance of Standards
and Codes (ROSC) have been published as
Country Report No. 01/206, 02/254 and 03/389.

Statement by Menno Snel, Executive Director for Romania
and Serban Matei, Senior Advisor to the Executive Director
May 9, 2016
Within the framework of the programs supported by the IMF, the European Union and the
World Bank, Romania has registered remarkable progress across its macroeconomic
fundamentals in the last decade. As staff well noted, prudent policies, reduced vulnerabilities,
and the fiscal and current account deficits improved markedly. After reentering the positive
GDP growth territory in 2011, the economy continues to expand for the fourth consecutive
year, the current account deficit dropped and a sharp fiscal consolidation process led to a
reduction in the public deficit. Inflation has continued to come down, entering the negative
territory in June 2015. Romania has maintained a resilient banking system, NPL ratios
significantly decreased, adequate buffers were kept in place and no public funds have been
necessary to support the banking sector during the global financial crisis. The Romanian
authorities are aware of existing vulnerabilities and remain committed to continue on the path
of reform and to further improve resilience and make the economic growth more structural.
Despite a challenging environment, Romania’s economic recovery continues. Romania
significantly reduced its internal and external imbalances through an important fiscal
consolidation and prudent monetary and financial sector policies. In 2015, real GDP posted a
swift annual growth rate, resulting in a 3.8 percent growth of Romania’s economy as a
whole. Private consumption noted an annual increase of 6.1 percent, marking a new postcrisis record high. This was underpinned by households’ higher purchasing power, as a result
of the lower consumer prices, on the one hand, and of the uptrend in the nominal income, on
the other hand. In addition to private consumption growth, gross investments increased by
8.8 percent. The inflation rate had a positive evolution during the last years. Since 2013,
when the central bank brought inflation back within the target range, it has been on a
descending path. At the end of 2015, the annual CPI inflation rate continued to stay under the
lower bound of the ±1 percentage point variation band of the 2.5 percent flat target. Under
the current baseline scenario, the annual CPI inflation is projected to remain negative but
later this year would return to positive levels, below the lower bound of the variation band of
the target. The inflation rate is expected to reenter the variation band at the beginning of 2017
and stay there until the projection horizon, when it is seen reaching 3.4 percent.
The external position has improved markedly. The current account deficit adjusted
remarkably since the global financial crisis (1.1 percent) and registered a modest widening in
2015. Romania continued and improved its presence on international capital markets, thus
generating significant buffers. FDI inflows improved moderately due to the reinvestment of
earnings and the economic recovery. As staff notes, despite large repayments to the Fund and
the EU, gross reserves of €35.5 billion at end-2015 are broadly adequate by most reserve
adequacy metrics. Despite the achieved progress, the economy remains vulnerable to adverse

2
developments in international markets. However, the authorities will remain vigilant, act
proactively, and take the necessary steps to contain these risks.
Significant progress continued in the fiscal sector but challenges remain. Since the start
of the first program, Romania improved its fiscal position and reduced fiscal imbalances. In
2015, the fiscal deficit went below 1.5 percent of GDP, from almost 9 percent in 2008.
Following the legislation adopted in late 2015, a package of tax cuts costing 1.4 percent of
GDP in 2016 and a further 0.8 percent of GDP in 2017 poses significant fiscal challenges.
The new Fiscal Code involves a welcome simplification of taxation legislation and has
measures with positive revenue effects, including base broadening of social security
contributions. These measures are aimed at stimulating the economy and incentivizing shifts
from the informal to the formal sector. In addition, the authorities are committed to continued
improvement of the revenue collection, while maintaining the fiscal deficit at 2.8 percent for
2016, as well as continuing sound fiscal policies and stronger public financial management.
Recently, the authorities have made progress with prioritization of large public investment
projects and significant steps have also been taken to enhance transparency of spending of
public entities and the government plans to widen the use of centralized procurement. The
authorities are aware of the existing challenges and are committed to pursue measures for
fiscal sustainability and good public financial management.
The monetary authorities will continue to appropriately respond to economic
developments. The National Bank of Romania (NBR) continued the rate-cutting cycle,
lowering the policy rate to 1.75 percent, measures accompanied by a narrowing of the
interest rate corridor and lowering the rate of minimum reserve requirement on both local and
foreign exchange denominated liabilities. The central bank will ensure adequate liquidity
conditions in the banking system, while underpinning the good functioning of money
markets. The monetary authorities consider that a consistent implementation of an adequate
macroeconomic policy mix and the step up in structural reforms, along the lines of the
external financing arrangements, together with sustainable financial intermediation and an
appropriate remuneration of bank deposits, are pivotal to consolidating the Romanian
economy and enhancing its resilience to external shocks.
The financial sector in Romania has strengthened in recent years. In 2015, banks’
profitability reverted to positive territory, high solvency and liquidity ratios were reported,
and the non-performing loan ratio was stuck on a downward path. Contagion risks also kept
declining, as the reliance of banks in Romania on parent bank funding was on the wane. The
comprehensive action plan of the central bank consisting of NPLs sales, write-offs and higher
provisioning helped NPLs to further decline to 11.65 percent at end-2015. Moreover, total
prudential provisions at the end of 2015 were sufficient to cover over 58 percent of NPLs
while the IFRS provisioning ratio stood at 68.94 percent. The capitalization of the banking
sector stays above 18 percent. The NBR will continue to closely monitor and supervise the
banking system and take any necessary measures to ensure that banks maintain sufficient
capital and liquidity. Moreover, in close coordination with the IMF and EC, the NBR will

3
continue to regularly conduct top-down and bottom-up solvency stress tests as well as
liquidity stress tests of the banking industry. However, like staff, we consider that new
systemic risks have emerged: one is of a domestic nature and features maximum intensity,
i.e., the risk of an uncertain and unpredictable legislative framework in the financial and
banking field, and the other is of an external nature and features high intensity, namely a
possible exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
The government is determined to adopt, as soon as possible, the draft legislation and to
pursue a steadfast implementation of reforms aimed at improving corporate
governance of SOEs. Progress with the implementation of the structural reform agenda
continued but experienced limitations. Governance problems have received more attention
recently as the authorities are aware of the key challenges to improve the corporate
governance of state-owned enterprises, restructure those that have sustained long-standing
problems and pose a drain on the budget, raise EU-funds absorption, and improve the
investment climate.
Progress with reform of the administration and improvement of the business
environment is necessary and important. The efforts made by the authorities in this area
were recognized in the 2016 flagship report of the World Bank, Doing Business. Romania is
now ranked 37th from previously 48th, especially thanks to the achievements in paying taxes,
enforcing contracts and improving the insolvency system. However, the Romanian
authorities are aware that reforms aimed at making the public administration more efficient
and transparent should be sped up. Therefore, the authorities are aiming their focus on
addressing further progress with prioritization of public investment projects, strengthening
targeting of social protection schemes, extending centralized procurement to generate
savings, and passage of the public procurement law.
The authorities thank staff for the thorough and constructive discussions during the
Article IV mission, and for their valuable advice on macroeconomic policies. They remain
committed to prudent policies, focusing their strategy on promoting growth, increasing labor
participation, improving competitiveness, and reducing vulnerabilities.
