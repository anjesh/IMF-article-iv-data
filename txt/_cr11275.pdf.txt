Staff Report for the 2011 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2011 Consultation with Austria
Approved by Juha Kähkönen and Tamim Bayoumi
August 5, 2011
KEY ISSUES:
Macroeconomic prospects: GDP growth is expected to reach 3.3 percent this year, supported
by external demand, re-stocking, and equipment investment, and moderate thereafter, as the
cyclical recovery comes to an end. Inflation has risen to above the euro area average. The main
risk factor is turmoil in the euro area periphery, especially should it extend to core euro area
countries or Central, Eastern, and South-Eastern Europe (CESEE).
Bringing the public debt to safer grounds: The recovery and the current multiyear
consolidation plan are reducing the deficit, but not enough to put the debt firmly on a
downward trajectory in the medium-term, which is needed to address fiscal risks. With a strong
economy, low unemployment, and supportive monetary policy, there is macroeconomic space
to tighten fiscal policy further starting with the 2012 budget. Measures to strengthen incentives
for older workers to retire later, improve efficiency in the provision of healthcare, and
rationalize subsidies would cut spending while making the government more efficient. A
comprehensive fiscal federalism reform to better align spending and financing responsibilities
would further underpin consolidation efforts.
Strengthening private capital buffers, supervision, and regulation in the banking sector:
Austrian banks are absorbing large credit costs on CESEE exposures. As profitability returns,
priority should be given to building up high quality capital, as required by forthcoming
international standards, and exiting government support. Progress in enhancing bank
supervision and macro-prudential regulation should continue, also in coordination with
ongoing international efforts.
Enhancing long-term growth prospects by increasing employment rates and human
capital: While overall unemployment is low, employment rates of low-skilled workers could
be improved by reducing tax wedges. Productivity growth could be boosted by education
reform, particularly to increase the number of university graduates in disciplines that
complement R&D.
The staff’s team, comprising Ms. Detragiache (head), Messrs. Steinlein and Vandenbussche
(all EUR) and Ms. Mishra (RES), visited Vienna during June 2–14, 2011. Mr. Prader
(Alternate Executive Director) joined the discussions. The mission met with Finance Minister
Fekter, Austrian National Bank (OeNB) Governor Nowotny, other senior officials, members of
Parliament, and representatives of the social partners, the financial sector, and economic
research institutes.

I. CONTEXT
1.
With economic growth back on track, policy discussions focused on addressing
vulnerabilities in the public finances and the banking sector, as well as strategies to
strengthen long-term growth. While Austria’s fiscal position compares favorably with
other members of the euro area, the public finances worsened sharply during the crisis and,
going forward, face pressures from population aging and health care costs, as well as risks
from the large cross-border financial sector exposure. With increased market scrutiny of
sovereign debt risk in advanced countries, staff argued that Austria needs to bring the public
debt down more rapidly than envisaged under current consolidation plans, while the
authorities thought that current plans were sufficient. In the financial sector, there was
agreement that the challenges going forward are to increase the size and quality of private
capital, improve liquidity management, take advantage of ongoing bank restructuring to
address overcapacity in the Austrian market, and reduce risks from future foreign expansion
through supervisory and regulatory reforms. Discussions also addressed structural reforms in
labor markets and education.
2.
Austria is a federation and the current federal government is a coalition of the
two largest political parties. The current government coalition, in office since 2008,
comprises the Social Democratic Party and the center-right Austrian People’s Party. Also, in
Austria’s federal structure considerable political power resides with the nine federal states.
Thus, decision-making often requires building a consensus across different levels of
government and political parties. The next federal elections are scheduled for 2013.

rapid credit expansion fueled economic
growth but also a domestic demand boom and large current account deficits. In addition,

4
credit was largely denominated in foreign currency, creating vulnerability to currency
depreciation. After global money markets froze following the Lehman bankruptcy, the boom
in the CESEE came to a halt, and Austrian banks faced both a liquidity squeeze and
deteriorating credit portfolios. Government intervention was necessary to support aggregate
demand and stabilize the banking system, while a number of CESEE countries obtained
support from international financial organizations and the Vienna Initiative, whereby foreign
banks jointly committed to maintain exposures.
4.
A rebound in external demand, brought about a quick recovery in 2010. In
contrast with other countries, in Austria private consumption and employment held up quite
well during the recession (Figure 2); when external demand (especially from Germany)
rebounded in the second half of 2010 the stage was set for a rapid recovery, and GDP growth
reached 2.1 percent in 2010.2 The current account registered a surplus of 2.7 percent of GDP,
reflecting continued strong performance in services (mainly tourism and business services)
(Figure 3). Outward FDI recovered somewhat in 2010, but remained still well below precrisis levels. The real effective exchange rate remains broadly within CGER norms.3
III. OUTLOOK AND RISKS
5.
Supported by strong external demand, output growth will accelerate in 2011 and
moderate thereafter, as the cyclical recovery will have run its course. Continuing the
strong pace set at end-2010, in the first quarter of 2011 GDP grew by 0.9 over the previous
quarter, surprising to the upside and triggering upward revisions by forecasters. Growth was
led by exports, re-stocking, and equipment investment, while construction activity remained
feeble and private consumption was subdued, reflecting declining real disposable incomes.
The last readings of confidence indicators point to a slowdown in the remainder of the year.
Both staff and the authorities agreed that 2011 GDP growth would be strong, with staff a bit
more optimistic (3.3 percent) than the central bank (3.2 percent) and the two leading research
institutes (both 3 percent).4 There was also agreement that growth will moderate to around
2 percent in 2012. Staff viewed potential output as only marginally affected by the crisis,
with the output gap all but closed next year.
6.
The food and energy price shocks, higher excise taxes, and the strong economy
have pushed up consumer prices. In recent months, inflation in Austria has exceeded the
2

During 2009, private consumption benefited from increasing real disposable income, as strong wage
settlements followed high commodity-price inflation in 2008, and from relatively healthy household balance
sheets. Unemployment was contained owing to continued growth in services employment, in-work training
programs, and part-time work schemes.
3

The macro balance and external sustainability approach indicate an undervaluation of 4 and 8 percent,
respectively, while the equilibrium real exchange rate approach suggests a 3 percent overvaluation.
4

The Ministry of Finance relies on the forecast from one of the two research institutes for the budget.

5
euro area average: in June 2011, headline HICP inflation registered at 3.7 percent while core
inflation was 2.8 percent, about one percent above the euro area indicators. The authorities
assessed that indirect tax increases at the beginning of the year accounted for 0.4 percentage
points of the differential, and reckoned that it was too early to tell what might explain the
rest. Staff suggested that demand pressures from the strong recovery may be an additional
contributing factor, and that a reversal in commodity prices, the expected tightening of
monetary conditions in the euro area, and mildly contractionary fiscal policy may help
contain inflationary pressures going forward if wage settlements for 2012 remain moderate.
7.
The cyclical recovery is helping the fiscal balance, but current medium-term
consolidation will not reduce debt significantly. During 2007–10 the deficit widened from
0.9 percent to 4.6 percent of GDP, while the public debt rose by almost 12 percent of GDP
(Figure 4). The government’s multi-year fiscal consolidation plan would cut the deficit back
to below 3 percent by 2013 (in compliance with the EU excessive deficit procedure for
Austria) and further to

8.
In the banking system, profitability is improving despite growing NPLs, and
lessons from the crisis are being distilled.5 NPL ratios are high in CESEE subsidiaries,
albeit with notable regional differences, while loans in Austria are performing relatively well
(Figure 5). The large banks and most medium-sized banks were profitable in 2010 despite
continuing significant provisioning costs. Interbank interest rates have normalized; share
prices and CDS spreads for the large banks have recovered, but not returned to pre-crisis
levels (Figure 6). With acute crisis management over, the banks and the authorities are
turning to address several important challenges: reducing bank reliance on government
capital; substantially strengthening the quantity and quality of capital to boost confidence in

the banking system and build larger buffers to absorb shocks; adapting liquidity management
to address shortcomings highlighted by the crisis; reducing excess capacity resulting in
chronically low profitability in the Austrian market; and improving coordination of
supervision across jurisdictions.
Box 1. The Authorities’ Consolidation Plan
In connection with the federal budget for 2011, a broad array of revenue and
expenditure measures was decided and enacted. On the revenue side, these included a
bank levy and higher mineral oil taxes. On the expenditure side, expenditure reductions
spread across several categories were complemented by simultaneous increases in
priority areas, such as education and R&D.
The authorities estimate the impact of these measures, defined as difference to the nopolicy-change revenue and expenditure of the same year, as follows:

2/ Mainly subsidies.
3/ Mainly personnel, goods and services, and investment.
4/ Additional spending in priority areas (e.g. education and R&D).

In addition to these measures at the federal level, the authorities’ general government
deficit targets assume compliance with the following subnational headline deficit
targets stipulated in the recently renegotiated domestic stability pact (in percent of
GDP): 0.75 in 2011 (following 1.2 in 2010), 0.6 in 2012, and 0.5 in 2013–14.
Furthermore, the authorities assume a balanced social security budget throughout the
period (after a surplus of 0.2 percent of GDP in 2010).
9.
Risks to the macroeconomic outlook are mainly to the downside, and relate
primarily to a possible widening of the crisis in the euro area periphery. While direct
exposures of Austrian banks to Greece, Ireland, and Portugal amounted to only 2.1 of GDP at
end-2010, staff argued that the main risk to the Austrian economy stemmed from possible

7
spillovers from generalized financial instability in the euro area, and the authorities shared
this assessment.6 Turmoil could spill over to Austria, especially should it affect wholesale
funding markets, banks in the euro area core, or CESEE countries where both Greek and
Austrian banks have a significant presence. Adverse spillovers to Austria could also
materialize should the crisis engulf Italy, as Austria’s second largest bank is a subsidiary of
an Italian bank and the direct exposure of Austrian banks to Italy amounts to 5.9 percent of
GDP. Further appreciation of the Swiss franc through safe-haven flows might hurt Austrian
banks’ loan portfolios in some CESEE countries and Austria, where loans denominated in the
Swiss currency are widespread. Finally, a new economic downturn in the euro area might
curtail growth in the CESEE and lead to second-round effects on credit quality. Staff also
viewed as downside risks renewed food and energy price shocks and their impact on real
incomes in the CESEE, while upside risk could stem from a stronger-than-expected recovery
of domestic demand in the euro area or the CESEE.
IV. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Fiscal Policy: Speeding up Debt Reduction by Increasing Expenditure Efficiency
10.
Staff and the authorities concurred that current consolidation plans will not
reduce debt significantly, and staff

stays above 70 percent of GDP throughout
the period. Furthermore, a number of
factors, not taken into account in the baseline scenario, pose risks to the debt level in the
coming years: first, there might be further debt additions from the banking sector rescue;

Staff’s econometric analysis of the recent behavior of Austrian sovereign spreads shows that, while little
affected by developments in Greece, Ireland, and Portugal per se, spreads were sensitive to generalized market
dislocation, suggesting that Austria would not be immune from widespread turmoil (Annex 3).

11.
Hence, staff urged for stronger consolidation measures of at least ½ percent of
GDP annually, starting with the 2012 budget, until the structural deficit reaches zero.
Barring materialization of the aforementioned risks, this would pare debt back to pre-crisis
levels around the end of the decade, be in closer compliance with EU requirements for
structural and debt adjustment, and strengthen private sector confidence domestically and
abroad.8 Furthermore, an even stronger consolidation in the 2012 budget would be justified in
light of the rapid economic recovery and the possible need to contain current inflationary
pressures, should they prove more persistent than expected.
12.
The authorities viewed current consolidation plans as adequate, and further
efforts as not politically feasible in the short-term. The authorities considered that
stronger-than-envisaged growth will likely lead to significantly better deficit outcomes. They
also pointed to the protracted and difficult negotiations on the current multiyear package (the
2011 budget was not approved until December 2010) as a reason for not wanting to reopen
the issue. All in all, the authorities were not inclined to take additional consolidation steps in
the 2012 budget, or even before the next national parliamentary election in 2013.
13.
Staff recommended expenditure rationalization in three main areas: early
pensions, health care, and subsidies. Staff took the position that consolidation should
preferably take place through expenditure cuts rather than revenue-raising measures, as
7

See for instance, International Monetary Fund, 2010, “Macro-Fiscal Implications of Health Care Reform in
Advanced and Emerging Economies,” Paper by the Fiscal Affairs Department, December (Washington).
8

The EU Council’s “Recommendation on the National Reform Programme 2011 of Austria and delivering a
Council opinion on the updated Stability Programme of Austria, 2011–14” of June 20, 2011 recommends an
average annual fiscal effort of 0.75 percent of GDP over the period 2011–13.

9
Austria’s revenue-to-GDP ratio is already high in international comparison. Three areas
where expenditure exceeds levels in peer countries and ample scope for rationalization exists
are especially amenable to reform (Annex 4):
a. Pensions and other benefits fostering widespread early labor market exit are no
longer affordable and ongoing reforms should be strengthened. The early
retirement scheme for long-term insured (“Hacklerregelung”) should be fully
abolished in 2012 and eligibility for disability pensions further reduced, including
by broadening the scope of alternative occupations against which disability is
assessed. All other avenues to early inactivity for older workers without fair
benefit reduction must also be closed rapidly to avoid substitution across different
avenues. In parallel, job opportunities for older workers need to be improved.
b. The large efficiency gains that are possible in the health care sector should be
promptly reaped. Hospital planning should be enforced on a nationwide scale to
optimize size, degree of specialization, and distribution of hospitals across
Austria’s territory. To that end, hospital financing should be pooled at the federal
level and disbursements linked to clear performance criteria. In parallel,
outpatient treatment and prevention should be strengthened and better integrated.
c. Reducing the comparatively high level of subsidies requires restructuring and cost
savings at public enterprises. This relates in particular to Austrian Railways
(OeBB) where operating costs, pensions, and infrastructure investments offer
scope for rationalization. The basis for subsidy cuts in other areas should be laid
quickly by implementing comprehensively the authorities’ initiative to develop a
database on subsidies and transfers. This would enhance transparency and open
the way to a broad re-evaluation of spending in this area, clarifying priorities and
eliminating redundant subsidies.
The authorities broadly agreed with these expenditure reform priorities, and noted that a
number of measures have already been enacted together with the 2011 budget in particular as
regards early pensions. They also pointed to different working groups studying some of the
above issues, but left it open whether and when specific recommendations and decisions
might emerge from this work.
14.
While recognizing that fiscal federalism in its current form is too complex and
hampers expenditure rationalization efforts, the authorities were lukewarm to staff’s
calls for a comprehensive revamping and an ambitious timetable for reform. Austrian
fiscal federalism is characterized by a disconnect between spending and financing
responsibilities in key areas, such as health and education; in addition, spending
responsibilities in some areas are excessively fragmented across levels of government.
Expenditure rationalization would therefore benefit from a reconfiguration of tasks across
government levels and better alignment between spending decisions and their financing

10
(Annex 5). Staff proposed that a comprehensive fiscal federalism reform to address these
problems be agreed upon before the negotiations on the next fiscal equalization law. With
preparatory work already far along, this goal should be achievable and would further cement
investor confidence in Austria’s consolidation drive. While the authorities did not rule out
this idea and had commissioned studies on the issue, a concrete timetable for following-up on
this work and initiate reforms had not yet been decided.
15.
In the staff’s view, fiscal federalism reform would also help achieving
compliance with the domestic stability pact, which would furthermore benefit from
enhanced budgetary planning. The domestic Austrian stability pact has recently been
revised and foresees a reduction of the deficit of sub-national governments from 1.2 percent
of GDP in 2010 to 0.5 percent in 2014. Staff pointed out that subnational deficit objectives
have consistently been missed in the past, while the authorities were more optimistic about
the fulfillment of the current targets, also in light of the stricter sanctions for non-compliance
envisaged under the new pact. Staff also suggested that better compliance could be fostered
by more ex-ante budgetary coordination and harmonization of planning instruments across
government levels, and that medium- and long-term sustainability analysis should become an
integral and prominent part of planning at all levels so as to strengthen awareness of debt
dynamics and help control the costs of aging. This analysis could be used to derive long-term
expenditure target paths for crucial expenditure categories.
B. The Financial Sector: Managing Credit Risk and Building a More Stable System
16.
Staff reviewed with the authorities and the banks strategies to deal with NPLs in
the CESEEs. As growth has resumed in the region, NPL ratios are expected to peak this
year. To deal with the large stock of problem loans, banks have put in place or strengthened
loan collection and restructuring departments in their CESEE subsidiaries; some banks also
report sales of NPL portfolios to local recovery specialists. The authorities estimate that, as
of end-2010, the top six Austrian banks had restructured loans corresponding to about
5 percent of their total risk exposure. At around 42.5 percent, the ratio of provisions to NPLs
in the CESEE subsidiaries is low compared to that of Austrian operations (70.8 percent), and
the authorities expect it to increase going forward as new flows of NPLs slow down. Staff
and the authorities agreed that the extent of ‘evergreening’ remains uncertain, complicating
the assessment of the future evolution of NPLs.

In Austria, while Swiss-franc denominated loans are performing well so far, they
may pose a risk in the medium-term. Uncharacteristically for an advanced country, Austria
has a sizable share of loans denominated in foreign currency. These loans, mostly Swiss
franc mortgages, grew in popularity during the 2000s when the exchange rate was relatively
stable and the interest rate on the Swiss currency was attractive. Following the financial
crisis, however, the Swiss franc appreciated by over 20 percent vis-à-vis the euro, increasing
the value of the obligations. So far, these loans are performing well, in line with domestic
currency loans. This may reflect relatively conservative lending standards in the Austrian

18.
The crisis is fostering restructuring among medium-sized banks, which could be
an opportunity to reduce chronic excess capacity in the market. Fragilities remain among
medium-sized banks, one of which was nationalized during the crisis. The restructuring plan
for this bank is under examination by the European Commission. Another medium-sized
bank is thinly capitalized and failed the recent EBA stress test, but the announced sale of
most of its foreign subsidiaries and further deleveraging should help make it more stable.
Another, smaller nationalized bank has been restructured, with problem assets placed in a
separate entity. The mission expressed hope that the post-crisis restructuring would reduce
chronic excess capacity in the Austrian market, where interest margins are among the lowest
in the euro area, so that banks would be less dependent on profits from foreign operations.
The authorities were optimistic that this would happen.
19.
Stress tests performed by the OeNB suggest that the Austrian banking system
would be robust to a deterioration in credit quality triggered by a large negative growth
shock. The OeNB conducted a stress test of the Austrian banking system in the spring
of 2011 and published the results in its latest Financial Stability Report. In an adverse
scenario more severe than that envisaged by the 2011 EBA stress test, the Core Tier I capital
ratio (defined as in the 2011 EBA stress tests) declined from 9.2 percent to a still comfortable
8.5 percent in the aggregate at the end of the two-year projection horizon, and remained
above 7 percent in each of the three largest banks.
20.
Banks and supervisors are distilling the lessons from the crisis, and changing
risk management and supervisory practices accordingly. Both banks and supervisors are
more attentive to liquidity management, a major worldwide source of weakness during the
crisis. A new system established in late 2008 allows supervisors to perform weekly stress
tests for liquidity and funding risk. Implementation of the new Basel III liquidity regulation
will also be instrumental in this regard. Banks report that internal models did not adequately
reflect aspects such as the likelihood that host country authorities would restrict intra-group
liquidity and capital transfers during times of distress, the downward flexibility in nominal

12
wages and its effects on loan affordability indicators, and the risk of political intervention
‘legitimizing’ nonpayment of loan installments in crisis times. Staff welcomed the intention
to capture these events in future liquidity and risk models, and noted that supervisors
nonetheless need to remain vigilant. Newly-created colleges are coordinating the supervision
of banking groups operating across multiple jurisdictions and will work towards joint risk
assessments at the group level for the first time this year.
21.
Rapid progress toward achieving higher bank capital standards and early exit
from government support should take precedence over shareholder remuneration or
further cross-border expansion. With large NPLs, risks from possible heightened turmoil
in the euro area, and large cross-border exposures, banks need to urgently build up highquality capital to bolster confidence and improve future loss absorption capacity. In addition,
while the government guarantee program for bank liabilities has expired, capital injections
have not been repaid yet, though two banks (one large and one medium-sized) have declared
their intention to begin repayment soon. Staff emphasized that shareholder remuneration and
cross-border expansion plans should come only after capital build-up and exit from
government support. The authorities agreed that capital strengthening was a priority for
Austrian banks (also because many competitors in CESEEs are better capitalized), but noted
that dividend suspension was not a condition for receiving government aid and exit should be
conditional on a strong capital position.
22.
A strategy to address the too-big-to-fail (TBTF) problem needs to be put in
place, including through higher capital buffers for systemic banks, using the flexibility
provided by the forthcoming EU-wide rules. The recent crisis has raised the question of
how to curb potential future fiscal contingent liabilities from bank rescue operations.9 The
authorities are exploring options specifically targeted to the vulnerabilities of the Austrian
banking sector. The mission welcomed this initiative and emphasized the need to build up
stronger buffers against future risks and avoid some of the imprudent lending behavior
observed in the past. Given the specific risks posed by Austrian systemic banks (large size
relative to the country GDP, significant cross-border exposure concentrated in a single
region, high NPLs), capital add-ons for systemic banks would provide needed additional
loss-absorbing buffers in bank balance sheets. Limits on parents’ funding of subsidiaries
could be calibrated to bind in periods when intra-group loans fuel excessive credit growth in
host countries, as was the case in a number of CESEEs in the mid-2000s. They could thus be
useful to avert future unsustainable credit booms, but would not impede beneficial
international financial integration. This instrument would have to be coordinated with host
country supervisors. Staff and the authorities also agreed that an EU-level bank resolution
and burden-sharing mechanism would be the first-best solution for Austria in the medium9

proceeds go to the general budget, the tax does not build up a fund to finance future rescue operations.

13
term. Staff also welcomed as a useful step forward the establishment at the end of June 2011
of a cross-border financial stability group with authorities from most new EU member states
where Austrian banks operate, with the objective to improve crisis prevention and
management.
23.
The reform agenda should include stronger early intervention powers for
supervisors and revisit the institutional framework for bank supervision and
regulation, including with respect to macro-prudential policy. In the past, staff called for
legislation to strengthen supervisors’ early intervention powers and, more broadly, improve
the bank resolution framework. The authorities agree that this is an important part of the
reform agenda and are awaiting a proposal on a harmonized set of tools at the EU level to
move forward. This proposal is expected before the end of the year. In Austria, responsibility
for both on-site and off-site bank supervision resides with the OeNB while enforcement
powers are assigned to the Financial Market Authority (FMA). While the authorities and the
banks report much improved coordination between the two agencies, the benefits from this
division of labor remain unclear. A review of the supervisory architecture would be an
important topic for the next FSAP update, which the Austrian authorities have requested for
FY 2013. This review would also be an opportunity to discuss in depth the design and
implementation of macro-prudential policy, for which a proper legal framework appears to
be lacking according to the OeNB and the FMA.
24.
Significant progress has been achieved since the Financial Action Task Force
(FATF) identified strategic deficiencies in 2009. The February 2011 FATF follow-up
report was very positive in light of the substantial package of legal measures enacted in June
and July 2010. Upcoming actions will focus on effective implementation of the new legal
provisions, including the drafting of new or updated FMA circulars, training of reporting
entities and supervisors, as well as on-site inspections.
C. Structural Issues: Enhancing Labor Utilization and Human Capital
25.
Staff stressed two keys areas of structural reform to raise potential growth:
labor markets and education. Overall, the employment rate in Austria is high by OECD
standards, but there is room for improvement. As discussed above, Austrian workers exit the
labor market at a relatively young age burdening the public pension system but also
depriving the economy of a valuable factor of production. Closing avenues to early labor
market exit and enacting policies to encourage employment of older workers would increase
long-run growth potential. In addition, employment levels among the low skilled could be
raised and education reform could enhance human capital.
26.
The authorities acknowledged that “tax wedges” were high, and saw measures in
this area as part of a possible more comprehensive tax reform after the next elections.
Employment rates among low-skilled workers are modest (Figure 7). For instance, immigrant
workers, who are disproportionately low skilled, have an unemployment rate of 8.5 percent,

14
compared to 3.1 percent for the native population. While low-wage workers do not pay
income taxes, social security contributions are high in international comparison, pushing
labor costs beyond the productivity of many low-skilled workers, thereby curtailing labor
demand. Staff pointed out that a reduction in social security contributions at the low end of
the wage distribution (coupled with offsetting measures to make it budget neutral) would
increase employment of low-skilled workers and, through it, potential output. The authorities
noted that tax reform is likely to be prominent in the electoral platform of the major political
parties ahead of the 2013 elections, and labor taxation issues would be debated in that
context.
27.
Staff also called the authorities’ attention to the large school achievement gap for
immigrant and first generation children, now about 20 percent of the population.
Unfavorable educational outcomes for this segment of the population increase the stock of
low-skilled workers going forward, leading to lower employment rates and limiting human
capital accumulation. Policies to close this gap are important also in light of potentially large
new immigrant flows following the elimination of the remaining restrictions on labor
movements with countries that joined the EU in 2004 (Annex 6).The authorities
acknowledged better integration of immigrant children in the school system as a longstanding challenge.
28.
Both staff and the authorities saw tertiary education reform as key to accelerate
human capital accumulation. Staff observed that for a high-income country like Austria,
continued economic growth requires moving up with the technology frontier. While private
sector R&D activities are strong (and generously supported by the government), the
accumulation of human capital, a necessary input to R&D activities, lags behind. In Austria
only 18 percent of the population has a tertiary degree or equivalent compared with
26 percent in high income OECD countries, consistent with low rates of return on tertiary
education (particularly for women) in Austria. The quality of university education is
hampered by liberal admission policies causing overcrowding and high drop-out rates, and
by a lack of financial resources. A 2004 reform gave more financial and hiring autonomy to
universities while increasing their accountability. However, admission policies remain
liberal, and enrollment continues to exceed capacity in several disciplines. The authorities
recognize that policy initiatives to raise tertiary attainment are crucial to raising long-term
growth. The introduction of entrance admission tests (as in medicine, where there has been a
sharp fall in drop-out rates), policies to attract enrollment in engineering and natural sciences,
and measures to obtain private funding for education are possible policies under discussion.10

10

Private spending on education in Austria is 0.1 percent of GDP, compared to 1.1 percent of GDP on average
for the EU.

15
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
29.
The crisis, though short-lived in Austria, has highlighted old challenges and
created new ones that must now be addressed. While Austria’s fiscal position compares
favorably with other euro area countries, the growth of public debt needs to be put into
reverse to better face risks and cost pressures. The banking sector requires more, high
quality, private capital, and, as the CESEE convergence process resumes, expansion needs
to become more prudent. To foster medium-term growth, increasing employment of lowskilled and older workers and building up more human capital are key priorities.
30.
To put the public finances on more solid ground, additional consolidation
measures are needed starting with the 2012 budget. Total measures of at least ½ percent
of GDP per year, until the fiscal accounts are structurally balanced, would bring the debt-toGDP ratio on a clear downward trajectory in the medium term. An even stronger effort in
the 2012 budget is warranted in light of the excellent economic performance, rapidly
disappearing slack in the economy, and inflationary pressures. Priority should be given to
pension, health care, and subsidy reform—areas where government intervention can be
made more efficient and supportive of long-term growth.
31.
A broad reform of fiscal federalism would underpin consolidation efforts.
Incentives for an efficient use of public resources are weakened by a strong disconnect
between spending and financing responsibilities and the sharing of spending mandates
among different levels of government. A comprehensive fiscal federalism reform to address
these problems should usefully be agreed upon before the next negotiations on the fiscal
equalization law.
32.
The banking sector’s return to more normal levels of profitability creates the
conditions for a further build-up of high-quality capital and exit from government
support. Taking advantage of improved financial results, banks should move quickly to
strengthen their capital base, increasing both the quantity and quality of their capital and
exiting government support. This should take priority over shareholder remuneration and
further cross-border expansion. The ongoing restructuring of some banks is an opportunity
to address overcapacity in the Austrian market.
33.
During the transition to EU-level bank resolution mechanisms, measures should
be taken to address the risk posed by systemic banks. With a large, internationally active
banking sector, Austria has much to benefit from an EU-wide bank resolution and burdensharing mechanism for internationally active banks. Until a new framework is in place, the
risk that systemic banks pose to Austrian taxpayers should be reduced through macroprudential measures, including tighter capital requirements and, possibly, macro-prudential
constraints on intra-group funding models to prevent future credit booms. In general, greater
supervisory vigilance of lending activities, accompanied by pre-emptive action, is necessary
wherever financial deepening can quickly turn into an unsustainable credit boom. In this

16
respect, the establishment of a cross-border financial stability group with authorities from
most new EU member is welcome.
34.
Policies to foster labor market participation by low-skill workers and human
capital accumulation would increase long-term growth. High social security
contributions are an obstacle to the employment of the low-skilled and should be reduced (in
a budget-neutral way). Measures to close the large educational attainment gap of children
with an immigrant background, some 20 percent of primary school pupils, would improve
average skill levels and productivity growth. Reform of the university system, which is
burdened by low graduation rates and has low enrollment in engineering and the natural
sciences, could usefully include stricter admission criteria. These would reduce
overcrowding and drop-out rates, thus making better use of existing resources, and could be
used to steer students toward disciplines complementary to R&D.
35.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard
12-month cycle.

Annex 1. Potential Output in Austria: Structural Shifts1
This Annex derives an estimate of potential output in Austria and selected euro area
countries using a production function approach to shed light on the determinants of mediumterm growth in the country.
Methodology: Potential output in Austria is estimated using a production function approach,
in which trends in labor force participation, worked hours, and employment are estimated
separately. The starting point is a Cobb-Douglas production function with constant returns to
scale,
(1)
where Y is real GDP, A is total factor productivity (TFP), K is the stock of physical capital, H
is total hours worked, and α is the share of GDP paid to capital, set at 0.3 for Austria based
on historical data and previous studies.2 Total hours worked are:

where WAP is working-age population, LFPR is the labor force participation rate, ER is the
employment rate, and AHW is average hours worked per worker. Taking logs of (1), and
denoting the logs by lower case,
1

(2)

TFP can be derived as a residual from (2):
1

(3)

To derive potential output growth, an HP filter (assuming a smoothing parameter of 100—the
usual value for annual frequency data) is used to smooth the factor inputs that exhibit cyclical
behavior, namely the labor force participation rate, the employment rate, and average
working hours.3 Since HP-filtered data are sensitive to end-point conditions, the sample
period is artificially prolonged through a path for TFP and factor inputs reflecting a recovery
from the 2009 recession. The data are then HP-filtered using the extended sample. The
smoothed or trend values are denoted by bars. These values are used to derive the trend in
total hours worked as:

E.g. see Gnan et. al. (2004) and Koman and Marin (1999).

3

E.g. see Estevao and Tsounta (2010).

31
(4)
TFP is also smoothed with an HP filter. Finally, trend total hours, capital, and trend TFP are
combined to compute potential or trend GDP as follows:
1

(5)

Potential growth can be broken down into three components: TFP growth, capital
accumulation, and growth in worked hours:

(6)

Results: Using the production function approach to estimate potential output in Austria
during 1991-2010 the following stylized facts emerge:
a.

The average trend GDP growth rate has dropped from 2.3 percent in 1991–2000 to
2.0 percent over 2001–2010.

b.

The global financial crisis did not have a sizable effect on the level of potential output
or its growth rate in Austria.

The rate of capital accumulation slowed down markedly from 3 percent in the early
1990s to about 1.5 percent in recent years. There was a less pronounced decline in
trend growth in TFP from 1.2 percent during 1991–2000 to 0.8 percent over 2001–
2010. The trend growth in total hours worked, on the other hand, increased from
0.4 percent to 0.9 percent over the same period, owing mainly to an increase in labor
force participation.

32
These patterns of growth seem to share some but not all features with those of other euro area
countries, such as Germany, Italy, or France. While the trend growth rate declined in all the
four countries, in Austria it remains the highest. In all countries, improved labor utilization
helped support potential growth, though in Germany this process started only in 2006. The
deceleration in capital accumulation observed in Austria is also visible in Germany and Italy,
but not in France. In the latter country, as in Italy, there was a sharp slowdown in TFP
growth.

One possible interpretation of the shifting patterns of growth in Austria is that increased
economic integration with relatively-capital poor CESEEs resulted in a reduction in the trend
increase of the capital/labor ratio in the Austrian economy. This interpretation is consistent
with the observed deceleration in capital accumulation in Austria, as well as the increase in
FDI toward CESEEs. In addition, slower growth in capital intensity would also slow down
labor productivity growth and, hence, equilibrium real wage growth. Indeed, in Austria
average real wage growth decelerated from 3.7 percent in 1991–1999 to 0.7 percent in 2000–
2010.

Annex 2. Recent Developments in the Banking Sector1
Austria’s financial sector is dominated by traditional retail banks. Financial stability
concerns are mainly related to credit risk in the banks’ large loan portfolios in the CESEEs,
where NPLs have mounted following the 2009 financial crisis.
A. Profitability has Improved, But Credit Quality in the CESEEs Remains
Problematic
Total consolidated bank assets amounted to around EUR 1.15 trillion at end-2010, stable
from 2009, while the capital-to-assets ratio increased to 7.5 percent from 7 percent in 2009
(Table 5). The net interest margin in the Austrian market was 1 percent—among the lowest
in the euro area—reflecting long-standing overcapacity. The loans-to-deposits ratio in the
Austrian operations remained close to 130 percent, as loan growth remained subdued and
deposits stagnated. Loans-to-deposits ratios in CESEE subsidiaries were also broadly stable.
Overall profitability improved, with the aggregate ROA rising to 0.5 percent in 2010 from
0.2 percent in 2009, as operating income remained strong while credit risk costs declined by
30 percent.

NPL ratios in CESEE subsidiaries are high, particularly in non-Russia CIS countries, where
over one quarter of outstanding loans is non-performing, and in Southeastern Europe, where
the NPL ratio is over 12 percent. Loan portfolios in Russia and Central Europe are
performing better. NPL ratios are expected to peak in mid-2011, as the growth outlook is
generally positive in CESEEs; pockets of macroeconomic weakness remain, however,

particularly in Croatia and Romania.2 Furthermore, coverage ratios (provisions/NPLs)
suggest that some banks may need to continue adding to their provisions even as NPL growth
slows down.
The quality of loan books is subject to a non-negligible degree of uncertainty for several
reasons. First, the amount of loan “evergreening” is difficult to quantify, and the treatment of
performing restructured loans in provisioning rules may not fully reflect their higher
probability of default. Second, foreclosing real estate has proven challenging as a result of
official or unofficial administrative barriers and lack of market liquidity. Third, anecdotal
evidence suggests that in a few countries a weak legal system is hampering loan recovery.
In response to the shock to the quality of their loan book, banks have been strengthening debt
work-out and collection strategies, focusing first on early collection as well as loan
restructuring and, more recently, on late collection and collateral recovery. In parallel, the
OeNB and the FMA have stepped up their monitoring activities and are in intense dialogue
with all large credit institutions regarding credit risk developments and loan work-out
strategies in CESEEs.
Despite sizable exchange rate depreciation in some countries, foreign currency loans in
CESEEs are generally not performing worse than local currency loans in the aggregate. In
the CESEEs, 47.6 percent of loans by Austrian banks’ subsidiaries were in foreign currency
at end-2010, higher than the average of other competitors in the region. Cross-border loans
were predominantly in foreign currency (77 percent at end-2010). Available evidence does
not point to significantly higher aggregate NPL ratios for foreign currency loans, likely
because these loans are disproportionately in the secured category which is performing
relatively better. Nonetheless, the large stock of foreign currency loans is problematic as it
limits policy responses during crises (for instance, by making currency depreciation more
costly) and makes domestic demand less resilient following an external shock.
NPLs on exposures booked in Austria are low, but the large share of Swiss francdenominated loans is a cause for concern. Recent exchange rate developments have
adversely affected 30 percent of household loans that are denominated in foreign currency
(mainly Swiss francs mortgages). So far, only a small share of these mortgages is nonperforming, but this might change should the Swiss franc continue to appreciate strongly, as
it has done since 2009. Furthermore, since most of these loans are linked to investment
vehicles and have bullet maturity, the full impact of the appreciation will be felt only when
sizable loan vintages mature starting in 2017. Following strong supervisory measures—but

According to spring 2011 REO forecasts, GDP growth will accelerate in 2011 by 0.8 percentage points in New

also unfavorable exchange rate movements acting as a deterrent—the stock of household
foreign-currency loans (adjusted for exchange rate movements) is now on a declining trend.
B. Capitalization is Comfortable on Average, but Some Medium-sized Banks Are
Weak and Capital Quality Needs to Improve
The average CAR in the banking system stood at 13.2 and the Tier I CAR at 10.0 at end2010, well above the current regulatory minima. Tier I CAR ratios for the three largest banks
were also significantly above regulatory minima but slightly below the average of European
peers (Figure 5). However, the quality of capital is unlikely to be sufficient given new
emerging international standards.3
Among medium-sized institutions, one bank which was nationalized in 2009 reported large
losses in 2010 as a result of write-downs on its CESEE portfolio. A restructuring plan has
been drafted and is under examination by the European Commission. A second troubled
medium-sized bank returned to profit in 2010, but relies heavily on government capital. This
bank failed the recent EBA stress test and is planning further significant deleveraging.
Finally, a smaller bank taken over by the government has been restructured, and its impaired
assets transferred to a separate entity; however, the medium-term viability of the new
institution remains to be demonstrated.
During the crisis, the Austrian government injected participation capital (a form of nonvoting shares) into five of the six largest banks in the amount of €5.88 billion. One large
bank has begun the administrative process to repay the injection, and a medium-sized bank is
planning to make a partial repayment to avoid conversion of the participation capital into
ordinary shares.4 The other large bank received shareholders’ authorization to repay the
government but has not announced yet the timing of this operation. In the meantime, it has
resumed paying dividends at pre-crisis levels and has acquired a bank in the CESEEs.
Besides repaying the government, banks need to improve the quantity and quality of their
capital to meet new international standards, as incorporated in the forthcoming CRD IV
directive that will enact the Basel III agreement in the EU. Key issues for Austrian banks will
be the recognition of controlling interests and participation capital in the EU legislation (see
table below). The capital gap is particularly large for some medium-sized banks. The

1/ A sizable share of non-controlling interest capital is likely to be recognized as Core Tier I capital under
forthcoming new capital rules.

The OeNB regularly performs stress tests to assess the resilience of the banking system. The
latest test included a downside macroeconomic scenario with a sharp negative shock to
investor confidence leading to a cumulative GDP shortfall of 5.8 percentage points in Austria
and 4.7–7.8 percentage points in CESEE sub-regions relative to the baseline scenario over a
two-year simulation period. In this refinancing crisis scenario, the aggregate Core Tier I ratio
of the banking system declined from 9.2 percent to 8.5 percent.6
Banks exhibit solid liquidity and have reduced their dependence on Eurosystem operations.
The net funding gap (cumulated over 12 months, before money market operations) has
remained stable around €40 billion while the counterbalancing capacity exceeds €80 billion.
These indicators are monitored and stress-tested weekly by the OeNB using data from a
forward-looking liquidity reporting system introduced at the beginning of the crisis. The net
position of the Austrian banking system in the unsecured money market remains in a range of
1 to 1.5 percent of total assets, while the share of the Austrian banks in the outstanding
amount of Eurosystem tender operations has decreased significantly. At the beginning of
May 2011, Austrian banks owed €5.7 billion to the ESCB while the pre-crisis average was
about €10 billion.

5

A December 2010 OeNB simulation study suggested that Austrian banks needed to raise € 8.9 billion.
Together with the capital needed to repay the government, capital needs would total €14.8 billion. As a
benchmark, total after-tax profits of the banking system peaked at € 9.8 billion in 2007.

6

The Core Tier I capital definition was the same as the EBA for its June 2011 stress tests. It included public
participation capital and non-controlling interests.

Annex 3. Spillover Risks from the Euro Area Periphery to Austria1
Though spreads on Austrian government debt are higher than before the financial crisis,
recent financial tensions in the euro area periphery have not prompted financial markets to
price in an extra risk premium for Austria so far. This annex examines the correlation
between sovereign bond spreads for Austria and spreads for the three euro area countries
that have received international financial assistance, Greece, Ireland, and Portugal (the
EA3). This exercise is a test of whether markets expect that increased risk in those countries
would spill over to Austria.
After increasing sharply for a brief period in early 2009, over the past two years the Austrian
sovereign spread has been trending downward while EA3 spreads have risen substantially.

To estimate the relationship between Austrian and EA3 perceived sovereign risk more
rigorously, we regress changes in sovereign bond spreads in Austria on changes in spreads
for similar bonds in the EA3 (and a constant term) during a moving window over 26 weeks.
In the regression, global financial market conditions including the TED spread, the VIX, and
their interactions with the crisis occurrence are controlled for. The results show that Austrian
spreads have become considerably less sensitive to EA3 spreads in recent months,
particularly since the spring of 2010, when the international assistance package for Greece
was put together. Thus over the past year, financing conditions in the EA3 affected Austria
only to the extent they registered on a global scale. This suggests that, while it is unlikely to
be affected if market concerns remain confined to the EA3 countries, Austria would likely
suffer should these concerns lead to generalized market turmoil.

Annex 4. Options for Government Expenditure Rationalization in Austria1
International comparison suggests that the following three areas offer particular scope for
efficiency gains and rationalization: early labor market exit (Section A), health care
(Section B) and subsidies (Section C).
A. Early Labor Market Exit
In Austria, early labor market exit occurs mainly through early retirement, disability, special
old-age part-time arrangements, and specific unemployment benefit rules for workers with
retirement options in sight. While the statutory retirement age is 65 years for men and
60 years for women (with stepwise equalization to 65 scheduled from 2024 onwards), the
average age at which either a disability or an old-age pension is drawn is much lower. For
members of the social security system it was 59.1 years for men and 57.1 years for women in
2010. This is the second lowest age in the OECD. Specifically, the average entry age for
invalidity pensions was 53.5 years for men and 50.1 years for women, and for old-age
pensions it was 62.6 years for men and 59.3 years for women. The latter contributes to
rendering Austria’s share of old-age expenditure in GDP one of the highest in the euro area,
while the old-age support ratio compares rather favorably (see text figure below).
The authorities consider closing the gap between the statutory retirement age and the average
effective pension age a reform priority and have recently enacted the following main
measures:
Restrictions on the penalty-free early retirement of workers with long contribution
periods (“Hacklerregelung”). In

stepwise increases to 62 thereafter).
Also by 2014, the purchase of imputed contribution times will be abolished. The
“Hacklerregelung” was introduced in 2006 and extended in 2008, offsetting earlier
attempts to reduce early retirement in the context of the pension reforms of 2003 and
2004.

Eligibility criteria for disability
pensions were tightened. Specifically,

However, the range of alternative

assessed remains narrow. The
authorities are also introducing
workplace measures to gradually
enhance the prevention of disability
cases.

However, there are still other schemes that may bias incentives towards early inactivity and
may now be taken up more frequently. Examples for other possibilities to exit the labor
market before the statutory retirement age are:


The “regular” early retirement scheme (“corridor pensions”) with eligibility from age
62 (only relevant for men as the statutory retirement age for women is 60);



Early retirement pensions for workers with particularly heavy working conditions
during part of their work history, with eligibility from age 60 (again, not relevant for
women). If they also have a long contribution period, these workers will be able to
continue to benefit from the current rules of the “Hacklerregelung” beyond their
phase-out date of 2014;



Subsidized old-age part time work arrangements, which are accessible up to seven
years before the statutory retirement age with a salary cut that is less than
proportional to the work-time reduction. The arrangement can be “front-loaded,” i.e.
it is possible to work full-time in the first half of, for instance, a five-year period,
while reducing the working time to zero in the second half;



Extension or increase of unemployment benefits for unemployed older workers.
These rules are intended to facilitate the transition to early retirement, thereby
reducing the incentive to continue the search for work.

The penalties in the form of benefit discounts for early inactivity differ across these options
but they are generally too low to be actuarially fair.
All in all, given the range of existing early inactivity options, the recently enacted restrictions
may not fully reach their objective. To the extent that they succeed in reducing the take-up of
long-term insured and disability pensions, they may just divert potential claimants to other
avenues.

42
B. Health Care
Total health expenditure and public health spending rank among the highest in the OECD
and have been growing faster than in most other OECD countries. Going forward, health care
costs are likely to continue to be subjected to considerable pressures from aging and
technological advances (IMF, 2010). On the other hand, health outcomes such as life
expectancy are not correspondingly better: for instance, a recent cross-country analysis in the
2011 OECD survey on Austria suggests that a move of the country to the “health care
efficiency frontier” would either imply a life expectancy increase by two years and a half or,
alternatively, spending that is 2 percent of GDP lower.
Hospitals are the main contributors to the high
health expenditure. Spending on hospitals was
4.7 percent of GDP in 2009, above most other
euro area countries. Other indicators of
overcapacity and/or an over-use of hospital
services are the number of hospital beds, in
particular acute care beds, which in per-capita
terms is the highest in the OECD, and the very
high hospital case load.

Although the authorities are aware of these problems, hospital reform is still in its infancy.
The states are the key decision makers in the hospital area but bear only part of the costs,
which are shared with the federal and municipal levels and health insurance funds . Hence,
the hospital area is a prime example for disconnected spending and financing responsibilities
in the Austrian federal system with consequent incentive-distorting effects. Also, possible
hospital specialization advantages on a national scale are not reaped, as existing planning
instruments at federal level are not adequately enforced to optimize the size and geographical
distribution of hospitals on Austria’s territory. In addition, studies show that hospital
efficiency differs from state to state. Discussions on health care and hospital reform have
intensified and include a more streamlined hospital financing mechanism that bundles
resources at the federal level (at a very minimum, between the federal government and health
insurance funds). Disbursements could then be linked to strict performance criteria. In the
long-term care area, a streamlining of financing and benefit administration has recently been
achieved, while for the hospital sector it is not clear when decisions will be taken and
implemented.
The use of out-patient care and prevention is lagging behind and the health care system is not
sufficiently integrated. Outpatient and prevention services remain insufficiently used, leaving
a major source for efficiency gains untapped. Again, this mirrors incentives: in contrast to inpatient care, health insurance funds carry the full cost for out-patient care. Also, there is no
gate-keeping function by general practitioners. A recent promising initiative towards a better

43
integrated care system consisted of facilitating polyvalent group practices but was
subsequently amended to only cover group practices of the same medical specialty.
C. Subsidies
Austria spends around 6 percent of GDP on subsidies and capital transfers, about 3½
percent of GDP more than the euro area average. The composition is as follows:

2/ an additional major expenditure item in the federal budget (apart from subsidies/capital transfers) are
pension benefits for former OeBB employees (around 2 billion euro)
3/ at federal level: includes agriculture only; at subnational levels: branch unspecified.

Almost half of total subsidies and capital transfers are disbursed to hospitals and Austrian
Railways (OeBB). More broadly, OeBB-related expenditures stem from three areas:


Compensation for passenger and cargo services;



Pensions for employees hired as officials before 1995, which are reimbursed from the
federal budget;



Capital transfers for railway infrastructure projects.

There seems to be potential for rationalization in all three areas:


Performance indicators, such as the turnover per employee (compared to, for instance,
the Swiss Railways), seem to suggest that there is scope for rationalization in the
operational business. This would also reduce the need for budgetary compensation for
passenger and cargo services.



With respect to pensions, the low average effective retirement age of OeBB
employees (about 52) indicates possible savings from improved utilization of older
workers, for instance by transferring employees to other posts (coupled with

44
necessary retraining) rather than sending them into early retirement on grounds of
disability or organizational needs. Furthermore, even after a transition period, the
final statutory retirement age for OeBB employees hired before 1995 will be 61½,
still 3½ years below the standard one.


On infrastructure investment, reconsidering the cost (including potential cost
overruns) and benefits of several large projects approved in recent years could reveal
scope for downsizing.

As regards other subsidies, a recent report under the auspices of the “Administrative Reform
Working Group” highlights a number of shortcomings. The group was instituted by the
authorities in 2009 and has examined different areas of public spending. As for subsidies, it
stresses in particular the following deficiencies (with varying relevance across specific
programs): lack of strategic long-term orientation, objectives, and priorities; unclear decision
criteria, missing focus on results and insufficient targeting (e.g., with respect to subsidies for
housing); unsatisfactory benefit analysis and ex-post evaluation; transparency gaps as regards
duplication of benefits for the same objective and recipient and overlapping competences
across government levels; and, in consequence, room for more administrative efficiency and
coordination within and across government levels.
The authorities have taken initiative to create a “transparency databank” to improve the
situation. However, important design issues are still under discussion, especially with respect
to the scope of subsidies and benefits that should be included at different levels of
government. If successful, this initiative could be the first step to a comprehensive stocktaking and evaluation of all programs. This could then be the basis for setting clear priorities
with a focus on growth enhancement and eliminating redundant subsidies.

Annex 5. Austria: Reforming Fiscal Federalism1
Austria is a federal country with 8.4 million inhabitants living in nine states (Laender) and
some 2,350 municipalities. Sub-national governments spend some 30 percent of general
government outlays. Intragovernmental fiscal relations and equalization arrangements are
highly complex and offer scope for increasing the efficiency of public service delivery.
Against this background, the Ministry of Finance commissioned several studies in the
context of a review of the current fiscal equalization law.2 The latter came into force in 2008
and has recently been extended by one year until 2014. The studies consider the Austrian
fiscal equalization and fiscal federalism arrangements in urgent need of reform and follow
earlier reform discussions (e.g., 2003–05 Austria Convent). However, a study on tax
autonomy at the subnational level, a key instrument for enhancing financing accountability,
is still under preparation.
Pivotal recommendations in the studies focus on the following areas:


A comprehensive streamlining of the distributions of tasks within and across
government levels. Current task assignments in several public spending areas, such as
health care and education, are fragmented, overlapping, and duplicative.



A closer alignment of spending and financing responsibilities. Following a better task
assignment across government levels, financing would need to be realigned
accordingly.



Enhanced realization of economies of scale at the local level. Some of Austria’s
municipalities and districts are too small for efficient public service provision. While
mergers might be politically difficult, cooperation could be further strengthened. For
instance, stronger incentives for cooperation could be incorporated into the next
vintage of the financial equalization law.

Reformed fiscal federalist arrangements would also further strengthen incentives to comply
with the domestic Austrian Stability Pact. After the old pact became obsolete during the
crisis, a new pact covering the period until 2014 was agreed this year, stipulating a reduction
of the combined deficit of subnational governments from 1.2 percent of GDP in 2010 to
0.75 percent in 2011 and further to 0.5 percent in 2014. While sanctions for noncompliance

have been enhanced and states have committed to introduce individual ceilings for
guarantees, it remains to be seen if the current set up is strong enough to prevent recurrence
of non-compliance. Also, there is still room to improve ex-ante co-ordination of budgetary
plans and to strengthen the medium-term budgetary planning frameworks. A medium- and
long-term fiscal sustainability analysis that becomes an integral and prominent part of the
budget planning process at all levels of government would create more awareness of debt
dynamics and help deal with cost pressures in the pension and health systems. It would also
be instrumental in deriving medium-term expenditure target paths for crucial expenditure
categories.

Beginning in the 1960s, immigrants came to Austria as guest workers without families to fill
labor demand in low-wage jobs. After the break-up of Yugoslavia, there was a sizable new
wave of immigrants; increasing labor market integration within the EU contributed to push
up the number of foreign workers in the following years.
Close to half of the immigrants have only primary education, another 40 percent have a
secondary education degree, while tertiary-educated immigrants are a minority. More
recently, immigration of EU citizens with higher skills has grown in importance as the EU
labor market became more integrated. In 2007, the share of immigrants with a tertiary
education was about 16 percent, up from 11 percent in 2000. With an unemployment rate of
8.5 percent versus 3.1 percent for Austrian-born workers, the labor market performance of
immigrants is disappointing.

On May 1, 2011, Austria lifted all restrictions on mobility of workers from countries that
joined the EU in 2004. In order to address the implications of the EU’s enlargement in 2004
and 2007, several member states including Austria introduced transitional restrictions on the
movement of workers from the new member states. These curbs could be maintained for a
maximum of seven years—until May 2011 in the case of workers from the eight countries
that joined the union in 2004 (EU-8), and until 2014 in the case of workers from Bulgaria and
Romania. Most countries lifted the restrictions gradually, with Austria and Germany the only
countries opting to maintain compulsory work permits beyond 2009.

The elimination of the restrictions on labor mobility is expected to lead to stronger
immigration flows. Currently, around 15 percent of immigrants in Austria are from EU-8
countries; immigrants from these countries are mainly in the working age-group (60 percent
in the 25–64 age group), and are predominantly low-skilled (86 percent have secondary
education or less). The elimination of the remaining restrictions is expected to lead to
immigration flows of roughly 80,000 through the end of 2013 (or 30 percent of the average
gross immigrant inflow per year). These projections are based on a survey carried out by the
Austrian Economic Research Institute (WIFO) in the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary.
Further opening to Romania and Bulgaria by 2014 is not expected to lead to large flows,
though precise projections are not available.
While in many countries school performance of immigrant and first generation children is
significantly worse than that of native children, in Austria this attainment gap is larger than
elsewhere. Part of the explanation is that parents’ education is an important determinant of
children’s educational attainment, and immigrant parents in Austria are less well educated

50
than in other countries. Furthermore, in the Austrian educational system parental effects are
especially strong, a phenomenon that has been attributed to the early streaming of students at
the age of 10. However, even controlling for parental effects the attainment gap in Austria is
large in international comparison.2 With immigrant and first generation children accounting
for 20 percent of elementary school children, improving the school performance of this group
would have positive effects on overall human capital. In addition, given weak labor market
performance of low-skilled workers in Austria, policies to improve the educational
attainment of immigrant children are also likely to improve overall labor utilization.

Exchange System:

As of January 1, 1999, the currency of Austria is the euro. Austria’s exchange system is free
of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions
with the exception of restrictions notified to the Fund in accordance with decision
No.144-(52/51) resulting from UN Security Council Resolutions and EU Council
Regulations, including the implementation of the sanctions on Iran according to EU Council
Resolution No. 961/210 as amended and on Libya according to EU Regulation 204/2011 as
amended. Furthermore, national restrictions apply with respect to certain terror organizations
and their activists within the EU, implementing decisions in the Common Foreign and
Security Policy (CFSP) framework of the EU.

Annex II. Austria: Statistical Issues
Macroeconomic statistics are adequate for surveillance. Austria subscribed to the Fund’s
Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) in 1996, and its metadata are available on the
Fund’s electronic Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board. Austria is availing itself of the
SDDS flexibility option on the timeliness of the industrial production index and the
merchandise trade data.
The transition to the new European System of Accounts 1995 (ESA 1995) has complicated
the analysis of national accounts and fiscal data. The reclassification of public hospitals in
1997 introduced a break in the national account series on public and private consumption.
Annual fiscal data for 1995 onward are derived from ESA 1995 data reported to Eurostat.
Data on outlays by function have been revised and are available from 1995 onward on a
comparable basis according to major functional categories. Quarterly fiscal data reported
through Eurostat are disseminated in the IFS.
The ECB reporting framework is used for monetary statistics and data are reported to the
IMF through a “gateway” arrangement with the ECB. The arrangement provides an efficient
transmission of monetary statistics to the IMF and for publication in the IFS and IFS
Supplement.

Statement by the Staff Representative on Austria
September 2, 2011
1.
This statement provides information that has become available since the Staff
Report was circulated to the Executive Board on August 8, 2011. The information does
not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
GDP growth in the second quarter remained strong, but prospects for 2012 have
dimmed. While exports, equipment investment, and inventory accumulation slowed down
relative to the previous quarter, resilient private consumption and weaker imports resulted in
second quarter growth accelerating to 1 percent, up from 0.8 percent in the first quarter, and
above the staff forecast of 0.7 percent. Looking forward, the less favorable external
environment, including the slowdown in Germany, suggests that the expected deceleration of
growth in the second half of the year may be stronger than originally envisaged. Thus, on
balance, annual growth for this year is likely to remain close to the 3.3 percent projected in
the staff report, while the outcome for 2012 is expected to be less favorable (1.6 percent
rather than 1.9 percent). Inflation in July remained elevated (3.8 percent), but favorable
commodity price developments and softening demand pressures should bring about the
projected decline in price growth in the remainder of the year.
3.
While the heightened financial market turbulence in recent weeks did not spare
Austria, investors' perception of Austrian sovereign risk did not deteriorate
significantly. The 10-year sovereign spread over German bunds remained volatile around an
average of 60 bps in August. CDS spreads rose about 30 bps during the month, broadly in
line with changes in German and Dutch spreads. Stock prices and CDS spreads for the two
largest Austrian-owned banks registered the generalized stress in the European banking
sector, though to a lesser degree than banks with large exposures to the euro area periphery.
First half financial results at the three largest banks showed an improvement in banks'
profitability owing to a decline in provisioning expenses while nonperforming loans ratios
appeared to be stabilizing.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
September 6, 2011

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2011 Article IV Consultation with Austria
On September 2, 2011 the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Austria.1
Background
With a rebound in external demand and sound fundamentals, the Austrian economy recovered
rapidly from the 2009 recession. Private consumption and employment held up well during the
downturn and, when external demand (especially from Germany) picked up, the stage was set
for a swift recovery. GDP growth reached 2.1 percent in 2010, with a marked acceleration in the
second half of the year. Strong growth performance is projected to continue in 2011, but
decelerate after a strong first half as the cyclical recovery runs its course and external demand
loses strength. At only slightly over 4 percent, unemployment is among the lowest in Europe.
Following food and energy price shocks, inflation has increased sharply in the first half of 2011,
exceeding the euro area average by about one percentage point, in part owing to indirect tax
increases at the beginning of the year. The current account registered a surplus of 2.7 percent
of GDP in 2010, reflecting the competitiveness of the economy especially in the services sector.
Outward FDI recovered somewhat but remains well below pre-crisis levels.
The fiscal deficit widened from 0.9 percent in 2007 to 4.6 percent of GDP in 2010, but the
cyclical recovery and consolidation measures—a combination of tax increases and expenditure
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:

cuts—are projected to bring the deficit down to some 3½ percent of GDP in 2011 and to around
2 percent in the medium term. However, with the government’s current measures, and taking
into account implementation risks, debt will likely remain above 70 percent of GDP even in the
medium run.
In the banking system, the negative effects of the crisis on credit quality are still in evidence in
Central, Eastern, and Southeastern European (CESEE) subsidiaries, where the nonperforming
loans ratio continued to grow in 2010. As provisioning costs have fallen, however, profitability
has recovered, and improved macroeconomic prospects in the CESE region should ease the
situation further going forward, while direct exposures to Greece, Ireland, and Portugal are
small. Banks have improved liquidity and capitalization, but have not exited government support
yet, and conditions in the medium-sized bank segment remain challenging, with one bank in the
segment failing the recent EU-wide stress tests.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for policies that have supported a swift recovery
and laid the foundations for a sustained expansion. Nonetheless, in view of the still fragile global
outlook and heightened vulnerabilities in the euro area, Directors agreed that important
challenges remain. Reducing the debt burden, bolstering financial stability, and enacting
structural reforms to boost long-term growth should top the policy agenda for the period ahead.
Directors welcomed the recent fiscal consolidation package and noted that Austria’s fiscal
position compares favorably with that of other euro area countries. However, they considered
that current plans may not be sufficient to put the debt ratio on a firm downward path and that a
more ambitious fiscal adjustment is needed to cope with longer-term spending pressures and
the cross-border exposure of the banking system.
Directors recommended that expenditure measures be the main element of the consolidation
strategy, given an already high tax burden compared to peers. In this regard, they noted that
savings could be achieved through further reforms in the pension system, health care, and
government subsidies. A careful rationalization of the fiscal relations among different levels of
government could also facilitate the necessary budgetary adjustment.
Directors considered that Austria’s financial sector has on the whole recovered from the global
crisis but that remaining risks call for further strengthening the framework for financial stability.
They noted that improved bank profitability should set the stage for upgrading their capital base
and exiting government support, while the restructuring of some financial institutions provides
an opportunity to address overcapacity in the sector. Directors also encouraged the authorities
to monitor closely risks related to foreign-currency lending, including mortgages.
Directors welcomed the role Austrian banks have played in regional emerging markets. Noting
the need to limit the domestic risks posed by this engagement, they recommended reinforcing

3
macro-prudential measures that address cross-border credit exposure. Directors also supported
ongoing steps to improve international coordination among supervisors, as well as plans to
strengthen the bank resolution framework.
Directors stressed the importance of persevering with structural policies to boost Austria’s longterm growth prospects. In this regard, they encouraged the authorities to step up reforms of the
labor market and the education system, with a view to increasing labor market participation and
boosting skills, including of the immigrant population.

Statement by Mr. Johann Prader, Alternate Executive Director for Austria
September 2, 2011
The Austrian authorities welcome the consultations with the Fund and appreciate the high
quality of the staff report. They broadly agree with the staff's assessment of Austria's economic
and financial situation and its general recommendations on economic, fiscal and financial
policies.
The staff report shows that Austria has weathered the crisis well and the recovery is on firm
grounds. Supported by generous automatic stabilizers and targeted labour market policies,
consumption and employment held up well during the crisis, contributing to economic stability
and setting the stage for a quick rebound in output growth as external conditions improved. The
fiscal position is favourable in international comparison, although public debt is expected to
remain above 60 percent of GDP for some time. The Austrian authorities take note of the issues
raised regarding public finances, the financial sector and the long-term growth strategy.
Short-term and medium-term outlook
On the back of strong external demand, output growth accelerated in the first half of 2011.
With capacity utilization back to pre-crisis levels, the export-led recovery spilled over to
investment, thus sustaining and broadening the recovery. Private consumption increased
steadily but moderately, as high inflation and subdued wage growth weighed on real
disposable incomes. The short-term outlook for the remainder of the year is positive, though
output growth will slow down as the cyclical upswing will have run its course. The Austrian
authorities concur with the staff’s view on the main risks to the outlook, which are external,
but refer to the efficiency of the crisis-mitigation measures and the muted overall effect of
the crisis in 2008-2010. It is also noteworthy that Austrian sovereign bonds were regarded as
a safe haven in the most recent turmoil on financial markets.
The staff report points out areas which would benefit from reform in order to support
medium- and long-term growth, such as the education system and the employment rate of
low-skilled and older workers. The Austrian authorities have already taken steps in this
direction and will continue to give priority to these issues in the formulation of the mediumterm economic and fiscal strategies.
Fiscal policy
The government has put in place a consolidation package to reduce the deficit to below 3
percent of GDP by 2013 and bring the debt ratio back on a downward path. According to the
projections in the report, staff expects the government to outperform on the deficit targets for
the years 2011-2014 as set out in the Stability Program, thus underlining the credibility of the
government’s consolidation strategy. The new budgetary framework in place at the federal
level has proven successful in avoiding expenditure slippages. Moreover, the Domestic
Stability Pact, which sets the deficit targets for the three levels of government, has benefited
from a reinforcement of the sanctioning mechanism, thus reducing the risk of budgetary
shortfalls at sub-federal levels. While taking note of risk factors to the public finance

2
situation as outlined in the staff report, the authorities consider the currently planned pace of
budgetary adjustment sufficient to forestall financing risks.
The staff report recommends reforms to improve public expenditure efficiency, in particular
with regard to health care and pensions. In both areas, important reform steps have recently
been taken and further consideration will be given to the issues referred to in the staff report.
Financial sector
Bottom-line profitability of the Austrian banking system benefited from the favorable
macroeconomic conditions in Austria and the CESEE region during 2010 but banks continue
to suffer from low interest margins in the domestic market. On the back of the economic
recovery, the crisis-related growth in risk provisioning for non-performing loans decelerated
in recent quarters and the overall NPL ratio of the banking system is now expected to reach
its peak in 2011. Due to the focus of their foreign exposure in the CESEE region, the direct
country exposure of Austrian banks to the Euro Area periphery appears manageable.
As evidenced by the latest Austrian National Bank (OeNB) stress test, the Austrian banking
system features a reasonable risk-bearing capacity. Based on the framework of the EBA
stress test 2011, the OeNB stress testing exercise of Spring 2011 includes an additional
adverse scenario that focuses on the CESEE and CIS region. The results show a manageable
decline in the core tier 1 ratio of the aggregate banking system with an increased dispersion
of results on a single bank level that was also reflected by the recently published results of
the EBA stress tests. The Fund’s assessment of existing weaknesses in a few medium-sized
banks is shared by the authorities, who play an active role in the ongoing intense
restructuring process in these institutions.
The strong commitment of Austrian banks to the CESEE region was a key ingredient in
maintaining financial stability in the region during the financial crisis since end-2008 and
supported the successful implementation of EU/IMF programs in several CESEE countries.
While this positive role has to be acknowledged, the crisis also revealed vulnerabilities of the
banks’ business models in the run-up to the crisis, in particular the significant level of foreign
currency lending combined with an unsustainable credit growth in some markets, and the
reliance on intra-group funding by many CESEE subsidiaries. Looking ahead, both the large
Austrian banks and the Austrian sovereign would clearly benefit from the fostering of local
sources of funding in the CESEE region and the further strengthening of the parent banks’
capital base. The authorities therefore agree with the Fund that the current recovery in
profitability and the favorable market sentiment towards the CESEE region provides an
opportunity for improvement in these areas. The forthcoming implementation of the CRD
IV/CRR in the EU also supports the case for a quantitatively and qualitatively improved
capital position of Austrian banks in the medium term.
In the wake of recent developments in FX markets, the high outstanding levels of Swiss
franc-denominated loans in Austria and some CESEE countries have come into the spotlight
once again. The total volume of outstanding Swiss franc loans by Austrian banks amounts to
approx. 70 billion EUR on a consolidated basis. The authorities’ long standing skeptical view

3
on Swiss franc-lending both in Austria and CESEE has resulted in supervisory initiatives that
led to a stop in new Swiss franc lending both in Austria (since October 2008) and CESEE
(since Spring 2010). The implications of the appreciation on the credit quality of the stock of
outstanding Swiss franc-denominated loan portfolios, however, deserve close monitoring by
banks, customers and supervisors as well as a general readiness to implement risk-mitigating
measures, if needed. The authorities are currently repeating a review of Swiss franc loans and
loans with repayment vehicles last undertaken in 2009.
