Staff Report for the 2011 Article IV Consultation and Sixth Review Under the
Extended Credit Facility Arrangement
Prepared by African Department
(In consultation with other departments)
Approved by Michael Atingi-Ego and Thomas Dorsey
July 7, 2011
Discussions: Lomé, April 26 – May 13, 2011. The team comprised Mr. Mills (head), Ms. Niangoran,
Messrs. David, Lonkeng Ngouana, and Ruggiero (all AFR), Mr. Sarr (resident representative), and Mr. Bah
(OED) also participated in the discussions. The mission met the President of the National Assembly Bonfoh, the
Prime Minister Houngbo, the Finance Minister Ayassor, the BCEAO National Director Tenou, and other senior
officials.
Relations with the IMF: Togo’s three-year ECF arrangement was approved in April 2008, for SDR 66.06
million (90 percent of quota). Augmentations of access of SDR 18.35 million (25 percent of quota) and
SDR 11 million (15 percent of quota) were approved in September 2008 and June 2010, respectively. The HIPC
completion point was reached in December 2010. The authorities have met all performance criteria and achieved
satisfactory progress on structural benchmarks for the sixth review. In the attached Letter of Intent, they request
completion of the review, to be followed by the opening of negotiations on a successor IMF-supported economic
program. With completion of the sixth review, the final disbursement of SDR 8.8 million will be made available.
Past advice: The previous Article IV consultation was concluded in April 2009. The IMF and the authorities
agreed that fiscal discipline and timely implementation of structural reforms were critical to reviving and
sustaining economic growth. Top structural priorities were reforms in the financial sector, public enterprises and
fiscal governance, including improving investment spending execution.
Article IV consultation: The discussions focused on policies to raise growth potential and external
competitiveness, while maintaining macroeconomic stability, particularly by (i) scaling up public investment in
infrastructure, improving the business climate, and reforming state-owned banks and enterprises; and
(ii) continuing to strengthen public finances, both in terms of management and sustainability.
Outreach and seminars: Staff and the authorities held seminars on: (i) public investment, growth, and debt
sustainability; (ii) fiscal policy rules; (iii) competitiveness and exchange rate assessment; and (iv) medium-term
outlook and debt sustainability. Seminars on (i) and (ii) were also held at the university. The mission also met
with representatives of parliament, labor unions, employer associations, NGOs, donors, and media.
Exchange restrictions and regime: Togo, a member of WAEMU, accepted the obligations of Article VIII,
Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the IMF’s Article of Agreement on June 1, 1996 and maintains an exchange system that
is free of restrictions on current international transactions. WAEMU’s common exchange rate regime is a
conventional peg to the euro. The BCEAO conducts monetary and exchange rate policies for the region. Banks
are supervised by the WAMU Banking Commission.

Executive Summary
Togo’s economic performance continued its gradual improvement in 2010, marking
progress in overcoming the legacy of its protracted domestic crisis (1990-2005). Economic
growth has accelerated progressively, reaching 3.7 percent in 2010 and a projected 3.9 percent in
2011 despite unfavorable external economic conditions. Macroeconomic stability has also
improved. Public finances have strengthened markedly, thanks to external debt relief under the
HIPC initiative and prudent fiscal policy. Despite global price shocks, inflation has remained
moderate, and the current account deficit, while growing somewhat, has remained financed in a
sustainable manner.
Thanks to strong implementation, Togo’s IMF-supported economic program has broadly
achieved its objectives in 2010. Budget execution was particularly strong in 2010, and all
performance criteria were met by ample margins. Moreover, investment and social spending
execution improved; the increase in the former was intended in part to offset the impact of the
adverse external environment. The program’s structural reforms continued to advance in 2010.
The improving economic performance and sound policies generally continued in early
2011, despite the adverse impact of the global oil price shock, particularly on fiscal policy.
Concerned with social stability, the authorities initially did not pass through the global oil price
rise to consumers, which led to costly and poorly targeted generalized price subsidies. To
maintain a sustainable fiscal framework in 2011, the authorities adjusted their policy approach in
June, by: beginning to implement a previously adopted automatic price adjustment mechanism,
with a smoothing formula; offsetting partially the costs incurred with spending savings; and
taking temporary, targeted social measures to cushion the social impact. Stronger public finances
have enhanced economic confidence substantially; care should be taken to preserve these hardwon gains. Despite ongoing progress, implementation of certain structural reforms has lagged
behind plans in 2011. In particular, preparations for bank privatization—a cornerstone of the
program—have begun moving quickly only recently. Capacity constraints have proven an
obstacle, highlighting the importance of continued public sector reform.
The Article IV consultation discussions focused on fiscal and structural policies to achieve
higher economic growth while maintaining stability. A planned temporary scaling up of
public investment in 2012-14 can support growth without compromising stability under the
authorities’ current policy plans. Continued public financial management reforms are particularly
important in this context. Institutionalizing the commitment to sustainable fiscal policies will
also be important, for example through adoption of a formal policy rule.
Accelerated structural reforms are key for robust, sustained and quality growth. These
reforms also offer important means to enhance Togo’s competitiveness. Its real effective
exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals. Priority sectors for reform are banking,
phosphate, telecommunications and energy, where the state plays large roles.

I. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND NEAR-TERM OUTLOOK: GRADUAL RECOVERY
1.
Economic performance continued to improve progressively in Togo in 2010, with
higher growth and stronger macroeconomic stability (Figures 1 and 2, Tables 1-5).


At an estimated 3.7 percent, economic growth in 2010 continued its gradual acceleration.
Exports of goods grew only 3 percent in 2010, reflecting a difficult global economic
environment and falling production in the phosphate sector. Offsetting this weakness,
agricultural cash crop production, manufacturing, public works, and port activity were
vibrant. While this recovery reflects progress in mitigating the adverse legacy of Togo’s
protracted domestic crisis and unfavorable external economic conditions, growth
nevertheless remains modest relative to regional standards and population growth.



Average inflation in 2010 remained subdued at 1.4 percent, thanks largely to good local
harvests and the very limited pass-through of higher global oil prices (Box 1).



Money and credit to the private sector expanded briskly in 2010 (16 percent and 19 percent,
respectively, year on year), reflecting an on-going recovery in financial intermediation. The
growth of both aggregates slowed late in the year, as reserve requirements were raised in
Togo as part of a WAEMU-wide harmonization.



The current account deficit widened to 7.2 percent of GDP in 2010, up from 6.6 percent in
2009; the primary causes were higher oil prices and rising imports of intermediate and capital
goods, linked in part to higher public investment. Offsetting this deterioration, capital inflows
increased (notably bond purchases, project loans and mobile phone license fees), reflecting a
recovery in economic confidence.

2.
The gradual improvement in economic performance and growth is expected to
continue in 2011, in a generally stable macroeconomic environment. Agricultural production,
manufacturing, and public works will likely be the main contributors to growth, projected at
3.9 percent. Instability in Cote d’Ivoire has had a broadly neutral net impact on growth in Togo,
as a shift in transit trade from Abidjan to Lomé has compensated for any disruption. Higher
global oil prices will create headwinds for growth; inflation is expected to rise moderately, as
retail fuel prices are adjusted and food price increases are limited by strong local production
(Boxes 1 and 2). The current account deficit is projected to widen slightly because of higher
global oil prices and further increases in capital goods imports linked to public investment.
Capital inflows, especially FDI and project loans, are expected to finance the current account
deficit fully.

7
Box 1. Togo: Why Has Inflation Been Subdued?
Despite rising international food and fuel prices, inflation averaged only 1.4 percent in Togo in
2010.1 This trend is in line developments in the WAEMU region, where 2010 inflation averaged
1.3 percent.

Abundant local food harvests and subsidized retail prices for petroleum products largely explain
the moderate inflation in the face of global

Inflation, however, is projected to pick-up in 2011, reflecting adjustments of fuel prices beginning
in June. Average inflation is nevertheless expected to remain moderate at about 4¼ percent, which is
typical for the region. Abundant local food supplies are expected to continue to limit the pass-through of
higher international food prices—however, this outcome is subject to significant risk, as highlighted by an
uptick in food prices in May, 2011.

The CPI basket was revised in 2010. The WAEMU commission, supported by AFRISTAT and the BCEAO,
launched a revision of the harmonized CPI basket in the region in 2008. The reform included expanding CPI surveys
and updating the weights of various sub-components to reflect consumption habits. To gauge the impact this
adjustment might have had on actual inflation, we computed counterfactual series by applying the old weights to
price indexes of CPI sub-components. The difference between the actual inflation and the resulting counterfactual
inflation was minor—average inflation from the counterfactual was 1.8 percent in 2010, only slightly above the
realized inflation at 1.4 percent.

Box 2. Togo: Impact of Reforms in Agriculture Following the 2008 Crisis
Following the 2008 crisis, the Togolese authorities implemented a three-year strategy to boost
agricultural production and strengthen food security. The strategy, adopted with support from
donors and the IMF, included fertilizer subsidies, increased credit to farmers for the purchase of
inputs (seeds, fertilizers, etc.), and productivity monitoring. The authorities also aim to continue
fostering rapid growth in the sector through an ambitious investment plan, with donor support
(including the World Bank and the Food and Agriculture Organization).
Along with favorable weather, the strategy has led to bumper harvests, especially for staples.
Aggregate agricultural production rose by a record high 11 percent in 2009, driven mainly by
staples. Cereal production substantially exceeded local needs, which helped build stocks. While
growth in agriculture slowed to 2.5 percent in 2010, partly due to flooding in some areas, local
production met local demand, protecting security stocks and moderating inflation.
A recovery in the cotton sector is also contributing to the revival in agriculture and overall
growth. Cotton production doubled between 2009 and 2010; while less than 2 percent of GDP, it
accounted for 0.3 percentage points of total 2010 GDP growth of 3.7 percent. In addition to the
measures described above, cotton sector performance has benefitted from the pass-through of rising
international cotton prices to local producers and financial restructuring of the state-owned cotton
marketing company, which has led to timely payments to producers.

3.
Risks and uncertainties nevertheless persist in the near-term outlook. Externally,
Togo is vulnerable to more severe global price shocks that would heighten risks for growth, the
current account, domestic price stability, and the budget. Domestically, social stability could be
weakened by a substantial further rise in the cost of living, especially in urban areas, which
might limit the government’s room to pass through additional increases in global oil and food
prices. Although the instability in Cote d’Ivoire has had little net impact, more protracted
political instability in the region could affect growth, transit trade, and workers’ remittances. As
discussed below, administrative capacity constraints could delay planned reforms to address a
number of persistent structural problems, thereby postponing recovery.
II. PROGRAM PERFORMANCE: STRONG ON BUDGET, MIXED ON STRUCTURAL REFORMS
Sound Fiscal Policy
4.
The authorities’ implementation of their ECF-supported program has been
generally satisfactory, with particularly strong budget execution. In particular, they met all
end-2010 fiscal PCs (LoI, ¶9-10).

Current expenditures were kept within
program ceilings, while the execution of
priority investment and social spending
improved substantially. The authorities
executed 91 percent of the program target
for domestically financed investment
spending, compared to about 71 percent in
2009. Externally financed capital and
current spending reached 118 percent of
program projections, as the authorities
developed more capacity to take
advantage of available resources thanks to
training on donor procedures and an
accelerated execution of ongoing multiyear projects. Priority social spending
essentially reached the program target
for the first time.
As a result of strong budget execution,
the PCs for the domestic primary
balance and domestic financing were
met by margins greater than 2 percent of
GDP (LoI, Table 1).1 Fewer domestic
arrears to the private sector were settled

tax collection benefitted from the
broadening of the tax base,

than projected, as many creditors still have not come forward to claim payment.
5.
The authorities are committed to maintaining a sustainable fiscal framework in
2011, which has required decisive action to contain the mounting costs of fixing retail
prices of petroleum products (LoI, ¶13-16). Out of concern for social and political stability, the
authorities did not initially pass through higher global prices to consumers, despite the adoption
in December 2010 of an automatic adjustment formula with a smoothing mechanism. The
resulting generalized price subsidy has an unintended regressive distributional impact and
mounting fiscal costs (0.9 percent of GDP through May).2 Freezing prices also led to Togo
having among the lowest prices in the WAEMU region (Text Table 1). Recognizing these points,
the authorities started applying the mechanism in June, which will lead to monthly price
increases of 5 percent and a reduction in the projected costs of fuel subsidies for June—
December to 0.9 percent of GDP.3 To cushion the social impact of price increases, the authorities
have adopted temporary targeted social measures costing 0.2 percent of GDP. Developed in
consultation with stakeholders, these measures include eliminating taxes on providers of public
transport and granting a transportation allowance to workers and pensioners earning less than
$2.50 per day, as well as university students. To limit the increase in the budget deficit, the
authorities also decided to offset the costs of the subsidies through May by postponing the
equivalent amount of investment spending (0.9 percent of GDP).

This cost estimate reflects the losses to the government of selling these products to distributors at fixed prices that
are lower than the import price paid by the government, plus taxes and agreed margins for distributors.

The smoothing formula limiting monthly increases to 5 percent will lead to continuing but declining subsidy costs
in 2011. Without any price adjustment, the cost would have reached an estimated 1.9 percent of GDP for JuneDecember 2011. All estimates assume roughly unchanged global prices for oil.

13
6.
These revisions to the 2011 fiscal framework are intended to address concerns for
both fiscal sustainability and the social impact of the fuel price shocks. Revenue projections
and other spending plans in 2011 remain appropriate, and the authorities have revised quarterly
quantitative indicative targets through end-2011 to reflect the changes discussed above
(LoI, Table 1). While the net impact involves a minor fiscal relaxation relative the initial budget,4
the cumulative balances for 2008-2011 have remained consistent with the program’s prudent
target of a domestic primary balance near zero, particularly given last year’s strong
overperformance.5
Mixed Progress in Structural Reforms
7.
The structural reforms planned under the ECF-supported program have generally
continued to advance satisfactorily, albeit with delays in some important areas (Text
Tables 2 and 3; LoI, ¶20-29).


The authorities improved public financial management by establishing the framework for a
treasury cash management committee in December 2010 (meeting an end-January 2011
structural benchmark early), which has begun meeting. Concerning a strategy for a single
treasury account, the authorities decided to initiate a consultative process with line ministries,
development partners and technical advisors to elaborate a strategy to this end (as a result,
the end-March benchmark was missed). The authorities remain committed to meeting the
objective in this benchmark and expect to establish a new timetable following technical
assistance from FAD.



The authorities have also started to address the sustainability of the pension system by
completing a financial and organizational audit of the public sector workers’ pension fund
and beginning an actuarial study of this institution (meeting an end-December benchmark).



The adoption of a roadmap for the establishment of a one-stop window at the Port is
advancing, following some delays. Technical difficulties in recruiting advisors for the
roadmap were resolved in April (completing the measure for an end-September 2010
benchmark with a delay). As a result, the end-March 2011 benchmark for the adoption of the
roadmap was missed. Work on the roadmap is underway, and the authorities remain
committed to its adoption once it is finalized.

4

The primary fiscal deficit will increase from 0.4 percent of GDP to 1.6 percent of GDP. The increase reflects an
accommodation of the cost of social measures to accompany the increase in retail prices for petroleum products and
the price subsidies during the application of the gradual price adjustment mechanism.

5

The average domestic primary fiscal balance for 2008-2011 is +0.15 percent of GDP. For reference, the DSA
assumes an average domestic primary fiscal deficit of 0.3 percent of GDP for 2012-2031.

14


The pace of progress in the privatization process of state-owned banks—a structural
cornerstone of the program—has fallen short of plans. A new public-private commission was
set up under the new privatization law as part of a consultative process. The deliberations of
this body have taken longer than initially expected. As a result, the authorities were unable to
issue the final call for bids by end-April (structural benchmark). However, to demonstrate
their determination to complete the process—one of the program’s key objectives—the
authorities have committed to initiate the tendering process by issuing a call for expressions
of interest before the completion of the review (prior action). The authorities now expect to
issue the final call for bids later this year.



A mechanism to recover NPLs was also not set up in the planned timeframe, owing to the
need to establish new legal and legislative authority. However, a decree to establish the
mechanism formally is expected by the end of July 2011 (completing the measure for an endDecember benchmark with a delay).

Of the six structural benchmarks since the last review, the authorities met two, completed the
measure for one with a delay, and have not completed the other three, despite progress. This
mixed record is explained by continuing technical capacity constraints, as well as consultative
and legal processes that—while desirable—are taking longer than expected.
8.
The completion of the ECF-supported program, with the conclusion of the sixth
review (as recommended by staff), allows for a preliminary assessment that it has largely
achieved its objectives. The program’s objectives at its outset in 2008 were to revive growth,
improve living standards, and strengthen macroeconomic stability, by: (i) bringing public debt to
a sustainable level through fiscal adjustment and HIPC/MDRI debt relief; (ii) facilitating the
resumption of external assistance; (iii) increasing resources for infrastructure, health, and
education; (iv) strengthening fiscal governance; (v) restructuring fragile banks; and
(vi) reforming the business environment and state-owned enterprises. As discussed elsewhere,
the general objectives of growth and macroeconomic stability have been achieved, despite
numerous serious exogenous shocks. Per capita income has also risen modestly, reversing a
downward trend during Togo’s domestic crisis, but even faster sustained growth will be
necessary to make substantial progress in living standards. The program fully achieved the first
four specific objectives, although continued progress remains important, especially in the third
and fourth objectives. Concerning the fifth and sixth objectives, significant financial
restructuring of state-owned entities has been completed, yet concrete results in operational
restructuring have fallen short of plans (for reasons discussed elsewhere). In particular,
phosphate production has not yet recovered, and the bank privatization process—a cornerstone
of the program—is running two years behind its original schedule—fortunately, the initiation of
the tendering process shows tangible progress. Finally, the business environment has improved
less than initially hoped.

III. ARTICLE IV DISCUSSIONS: BUILDING GROWTH MOMENTUM
A. Strengthening the Foundations for Medium Term Growth
9.
Article IV discussions centered on policies to build growth momentum in the
medium-to-long term, while consolidating hard-won macroeconomic stability. At the time of
the last Article IV consultation in early 2009, medium-term economic growth was expected to
average about 1.6 percent, in the face of the effects of the global financial crisis and price shocks.
In fact, annual growth averaged 3.1 percent for 2008-2010, because the authorities pursued an
appropriate countercyclical fiscal policy and the external environment had a less negative effect
than expected. Structural reforms have proven more challenging, however, because of limited
administrative capacity and the challenges of building political and social consensus for reforms
through legislative and consultative processes (Box 3).

17
Box 3. Togo: Response to Fund Advice in the 2009 Article IV Discussions
Togo has had a productive policy dialogue and program relationship with the IMF. The
country’s policies have been generally consistent with the conclusions of the 2009 Article IV
discussions and Fund policy advice, as reflected in the timely completion of the ECF reviews with
relatively few waivers, and the rapid achievement of the HIPC completion point after the decision
point. Authorities and staff agree on the main bottlenecks to growth.
Togo strengthened public finances while increasing investment and social spending under the
program. It made progress in public financial management and budget execution, while its debt
position improved dramatically thanks to external debt relief related to the HIPC initiative and
prudent fiscal policy.
Reform of state-owned enterprises, state-owned banks and the business climate has advanced,
although not as much as initially hoped. In retrospect, original reform timelines—e.g., for bank
privatization, restructuring of the phosphate sector and improvement of the business climate—were
too ambitious, given administrative capacity constraints, the need to update legislative frameworks,
the time required by new consultative processes and the challenge of building consensus. The
authorities are committed to maintain or even accelerate progress in these priority areas.

time, progress in meeting social needs
stagnated or reversed, as reflected in the mixed record in moving toward the MDGs (Table 10).
The quality, as well as the pace, of growth will be important in meeting these needs, which will
require continued progress in boosting social spending and fostering growth in sectors like
agriculture in which gains are relatively well distributed.
11.
To improve social outcomes in the medium term, the authorities intend to devote
much of the available fiscal space towards social expenditures. The authorities are in the
process of preparing their next Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, and they understandably
consider that the infrastructure gap remains a critical bottleneck to sustained growth and poverty
reduction (see below). At the same time, they aim to enhance their capacity to distribute the
fruits from higher growth more widely, increasing resources devoted to social objectives while
striving to match outcomes to available resources. To reconcile these social objectives with fiscal
sustainability, the authorities and staff shared the view that it was vital to improve social services

18
for the population in cost-effective ways, especially the most vulnerable (Box 4). To assist in
targeting, the authorities have started preparing a new poverty survey, with help from the World
Bank, in preparation for the next Poverty Reduction Strategy. In this context, the authorities and
staff also stressed that it is important to develop a productive and affordable civil service to help
meet social needs and address administrative capacity constraints.
12.
To address infrastructure bottlenecks, the authorities aim to scale up public
investment while maintaining macroeconomic stability and debt sustainability. The
authorities’ medium-term macroeconomic framework incorporates a moderate scaling up of
2½ percent of GDP per year in 2012-2014 (Figure 3). As currently envisioned, the financing of
the scaling up would rely practically entirely on external grants and concessional borrowing,
supplemented by regional local currency borrowing as necessary. Staff supports this strategy in
principle, provided it remains consistent with debt sustainability, macroeconomic stability, and
an appropriate financing strategy; the risks to sustainability of inefficient public investment
require continuing vigilance and capacity building for the implementation of the scaling up.
Fiscal and current account deficits would temporarily be higher, before returning to levels
sustainable over the long run from 2015 onward. Although scaling up investment is an
appropriate use of the room to borrow provided by external debt relief, the increase in public
investment is expected to lead to some crowding-out in 2012-2014 (Table 5), following which
private investment is expected to recover with fiscal consolidation in the medium term. In the
medium-term, growth is expected to pick up with the scaling up and then fall back with the
ensuing fiscal consolidation. Inflation is projected to revert to its long-term trend by 2012 as
pressures from global price shocks ease. Structural reform efforts to enhance growth would also
continue. Long-term growth is projected at 4.2 percent, based on trends in output in key sectors;
however, there are significant upside risks, depending the return on scaled up public investment,
as well as the impact and pace of structural reforms.
B. Sustainable Growth-Promoting Fiscal Policies
13.
The authorities recognize that the planned investment scaling up needs to be
accompanied by policies that ensure debt sustainability and high quality spending. Staff
stressed and the authorities acknowledged that the scaling up should be limited in time and
followed by a consolidation to return fiscal balances to levels sustainable over the long run
(Figure 3). The updated DSA (Appendix II), discussed with the authorities, indicates that this
moderate, temporary scaling up does not raise the rating for risk of debt distress. The fiscal space
available for investment also depends critically on mobilizing domestic revenue, controlling the
growth of current spending, and carefully managing significant public sector liabilities,
particularly those to pensioners and pension funds. On the revenue side, deeper tax
administration and custom reform, supported by the stricter control of exemptions, would
mobilize more domestic resources for priority spending. For the medium term, the authorities
intend to work with an upcoming FAD mission to update their reform strategy.

Box 4. Togo: Establishing a Social Protection and Safety Net System
Social needs are very high in Togo, especially given the economic stagnation during the long
political crisis and suspension of international aid. According to the latest survey on poverty in
2006, 62 percent of the Togolese population lives below the poverty threshold (based on minimum
caloric intake) and 82 percent are in a vulnerable situation, meaning that they have a high
probability to remain poor or to become poor.
Recognizing this, authorities have budgeted higher social spending under the ECF-supported
program, especially in the key sectors of education and health. The domestically financed social
expenditures are projected to increase from 5.4 percent of GDP in 2008 to 6.5 percent of GDP in
2011, a 44 percent increase in nominal terms. Over the same period, total social spending (domestic
and externally financed) nearly doubled. Efforts involving the authorities, Fund staff, and donors
are underway to refine it in order to allow better targeting and tracking.
Social needs are expected to become even more acute in 2011 due to the impact of the global
oil price surge. The authorities are implementing temporary, targeted accompanying social
measures for 2011, including a travel allowance for the lowest-paid wage earners. The development
of these measures highlighted, however, the lack of mechanisms to target the poorest segments of
the population in the informal sector and rural areas. The Togolese population remains vulnerable
to further price surges—according to preliminary estimates, further increases of around 45 percent
in global fuel and food prices will increase the poverty rate by about 4½ percent.
The authorities and partners are studying how to build more permanent, targeted and costeffective delivery mechanisms for social needs. A working group chaired by the authorities has
brought together experts from the World Bank and UN agencies (ILO, UNDP, UNICEF, WFP, and
WHO) to develop a national strategy for social protection, capable of specific targeting of the most
vulnerable groups. The preliminary results of a study led by the World Bank suggest that existing
social safety net spending (mostly cash transfers and food programs), besides price subsidies,
represented only ½ percent of GDP annually during 2008-10. Fund staff have participated in
discussions with the group and have also intensified bilateral dialogue with participating agencies,
especially the World Bank, UNICEF and the ILO. In particular, the authorities are studying the
establishment of a health insurance system for civil servants, with the support of ILO, which could
later be extended to the formal private sector and the informal sector.

14.
Staff and the authorities discussed an updated debt sustainability analysis that
showed the revised medium-term macroeconomic framework did not raise the rating for
risk of debt distress. The DSA indicates that Togo remains at moderate risk of debt distress.6
6

The authorities are negotiating with a number of bilateral (non-Paris Club), multilateral and commercial creditors
to reach agreement on the provision of debt relief on terms comparable to the relief accorded in the context of the
HIPC initiative in December 2010.

21
Togo’s external and public debt indicators are projected to remain below the relevant thresholds
under prudent baseline assumptions. However, Togo’s debt outlook remains vulnerable to
shocks, particularly if growth falls short of the baseline assumption or new financing is obtained
on less favorable terms. These dynamics emphasize the importance of the authorities maintaining
a prudent approach to new borrowing and maximizing the amount of external financing on grant
or concessional terms, as well as pursuing reforms to improve debt management capacity. The
Togolese authorities concurred with the DSA and its policy implications and expressed strong
interest in the consequences for the country’s risk rating for limits on external borrowing in the
context of a future Fund-supported program.
15.
To inform the policy dialogue on sustainable scaling up, staff applied a dynamic
general equilibrium model of debt sustainability on a pilot basis to investigate the growth—
public investment nexus in Togo (Appendix III).7 The model suggests that a larger investment
surge could promote growth without jeopardizing debt sustainability, under certain conditions
that would nevertheless require continued strong reform efforts. These conditions include
enhancing the efficiency and quality of public investment to a level typical of a sub-Saharan
African country, implementing a sustainable debt management strategy, and increasing revenue
collection (which might require an increase in tax rates if improvements in the efficiency of
revenue collection were not sufficient).
16.
The authorities found that the

public financial management achieved under
the ECF-supported program created a favorable context for scaling up. Staff stressed the need to
ensure robust fiscal sustainability and to continue improvements in public financial management,
especially project selection and execution, since Togo has had a relatively low public investment
management capacity (Text Figure 5). The latter’s importance is reinforced by the role of
assumptions on the rate of return of investments in determining the economic outcome of a surge
7

The model simulates an investment surge larger than the 2012-2014 scaling up currently reflected in the
macroeconomic framework. The model was developed by the IMF’s Research and Strategy, Policy and Review
departments, and its application to Togo is a collaborative effort between those departments and the African
department.

22
in public investment (Appendix III). The authorities concurred with staff and identified as
priorities mobilizing more revenue (preferably by improving the efficiency of tax collection
rather than resorting to higher rates) and accelerating ongoing reforms in public financial
management. The authorities intend to explore ways to apply this analytical tool, jointly with
staff, to quantify the impact of alternative policy options, in parallel with other tools (e.g., DSA).
17.
Staff suggested to the authorities that in the medium-term, fiscal policy could
benefit from anchoring public expectations and debate with a more formal policy rule
(Appendix IV). Given the authorities’ objectives of scaling up infrastructure spending while
maintaining debt sustainability, staff argued in favor of adopting a formal rule-based framework
with dual anchors for the fiscal deficit and debt level.8 A debt target would be set at a level
consistent with Togo’s institutional and administrative development. The anchors should also
allow for flexibility in responding to shocks, e.g., transparently and temporarily deviating from
the target. The authorities and staff agreed that a key ingredient to the success of a rule-based
framework—possibly in a simplified Fiscal Responsibility Law—is ownership. It is thus
important to build a consensus among all stakeholders following a public debate. While
recognizing the value of fiscal policy rules, the authorities noted that the importance of
discussing this issue at the WAEMU level.
18.
Given plans to finance growing public investment, it is increasingly important to
develop a comprehensive debt management strategy guided by best practices. Debt
management improved in a number of areas, including debt service projections, analytical
capacity at the public debt management unit, the elaboration of a basic debt strategy, and better
coordination among the different entities involved in debt management—although coordination
needs further improvement. However, the debt management strategy currently prepared with the
annual budget focuses only on external debt, does not assess the costs and risks of the existing
portfolio, and does not consider alternative options based on clearly defined portfolio
management objectives. The authorities concurred that a comprehensive, forward-looking debt
management strategy is an integral part of a sound fiscal policy, and they intend address the
current strategy’s shortcomings, with the support of the IMF, through AFRITAC West, and the
World Bank.
C. Strengthening Pro-Growth Structural Policies
19.
Togo remains committed to addressing numerous, persistent structural weaknesses
that constrain its growth potential and competitiveness. These weaknesses are generally a
legacy of the political crisis and the suspension of international cooperation, during which key
sectors of the economy deteriorated significantly. Growth and export performance have suffered
8

Deficit and debt targets would also need to be designed and implemented in a way that takes into account the
purposes of the financing. Since investment spending builds assets and fosters growth, it has different implications
for the sustainable level of fiscal deficits than current spending.

23
(Text Figure 4 and Box 5), despite a significant devaluation in 1994. Structural reforms to
address these weaknesses and boost productivity growth will improve both growth performance
and competitiveness.
20.
Although Togo’s real effective exchange rate has appreciated in the last decade,
standard analysis reveals no evidence that the exchange rate is currently overvalued
(Box 5). The authorities focused discussion on the main drivers of the real effective exchange
rate.
Box 5. TOGO: EXCHANGE RATE ASSESSMENT AND NON-PRICE COMPETITIVENESS
The exchange rate assessment finds that Togo’s real effective exchange rate (REER) was
broadly in line with economic fundamentals in 2010, highlighting the importance of measures to
strengthen non-price competitiveness. Survey-based structural indicators suggest that addressing
infrastructure bottlenecks and improving the business climate are crucial to unlocking the country’s
growth potential.
I.

EXCHANGE RATE ASSESSMENT

The three CGER methods—fundamental equilibrium exchange rate (FEER), macroeconomic
balance (MB) and external sustainability (ES) approaches—all suggest that the REER was
broadly in line with fundamentals in 2010.
The FEER approach relates the equilibrium
REER to a set of fundamental factors (terms of
trade, productivity, public consumption and
openness). It suggests that the REER was
slightly below its equilibrium level in 2010, by
about 4.4 percent, as opposed to a 4.2 percent
overvaluation in 2009. This result—mainly
driven by the depreciation of the euro over
2010— is consistent with the latest WAEMU
exchange rate assessment, which finds an
undervaluation of some -2.6 percent in 2010, as
opposed to an overvaluation of 6.2 percent in
2009.

REER equilibrium

The MB approach estimates the REER adjustment needed to close the gap between the current
account balance implied by macroeconomic fundamentals and the underlying current account
balance—i.e., the medium-term current account balance stripped of all temporary factors. The
analysis indicates that a 1.5 percent depreciation in the REER would be needed to close the gap,
which is not a significant deviation from equilibrium.
The ES approach estimates the difference between the actual current account balance and the balance
that would stabilize Togo’s Net Foreign Asset position at some benchmark level. Our scenario, based
on the average estimated NFA position during 2007-2009, yields an overvaluation of about
1.7 percent, again not a significant deviation from equilibrium.

24
21.
In this context in a regional currency union, the authorities and staff agreed that
supply-side, structural reforms are the key to boosting the country’s growth potential and
competitiveness. Given that Togo has geographic advantages for serving as a regional
commercial hub, non-price competitiveness will play role a vital role in fostering growth
(Box 5). However, over the past five years Togo has not advanced much on its position in the
Doing Business rankings, indicating that non-price competitiveness still has room for
improvement (Figure 4). Staff agreed with the authorities’ focus on investing in new
infrastructure; staff also stressed the need to improve the quality and maintenance of existing
infrastructure and to reduce its costs. The authorities place a high priority on improving the
overall business climate, with assistance from the World Bank. Fund staff stressed the
importance efforts to establish the one-stop window for all trade operations at the Port of Lomé,
where the length of procedures reduces incentives for compliance. Also, as mentioned above,
reforms have recently yielded disappointing productivity results in certain SOEs, particularly for
phosphates, where production levels and cost structures have not yet improved as much as
hoped, despite considerable investment in the past two years.
Box 5. TOGO: EXCHANGE RATE ASSESSMENT AND NON-PRICE COMPETITIVENESS (concluded)
II.

NON-PRICE COMPETITIVENESS

Although Togo’s exports are rising in nominal terms, its share in the world and regional market
has declined during the past few years—an indication of a possible loss in competitiveness. Togo
exports’ share in total world exports was relatively higher on average in the 1980s—reflecting
international commodity prices—before falling to a lower level by the end of the 1990s,
notwithstanding the 1994 devaluation. The country’s share of the regional market dropped from an
average of 12 percent during 2000-2004 to below 7 percent during 2005-2009 (Figure 4). Togo has
diversified its export markets but has not made progress in product diversification. While Togo’s
export base remains fairly narrow as shown by the Herfindahl index of export diversification (Figure
4), it compares well with other WAEMU countries in recent years.
Weaknesses in the supply and quality of infrastructure developed during the domestic crisis, and
its costs remain high for businesses (Figure 4). This tendency is particularly true in energy and
telecommunications, which impose additional strains on local businesses. For instance, value lost
because of power outages amounted to more than 10 percent of total sales in 2009, well above the
average for sub-Saharan Africa of around 6 percent. Recent efforts to ensure energy security, such as
bringing in a large independent power producer, are likely to limit future power disruptions, but
production costs have not yet been reduced. Generally, staff emphasized that telephony and internet
costs are high compared to other countries in the region, where competition and private sector
involvement in the sectors are greater.
Togo has made limited progress in the Doing Business Indicators over the past few years
(Figure 4). Although Togo is roughly comparable to the average ranking of other WAEMU countries, it
lags significantly behind Rwanda—a comparable post-crisis country—in all but two indicators:
“closing a business” and “trading across the border” (Figure 4). Given Togo’s vocation to serve as a
commercial hub, the authorities rightly aim to provide a business climate that is more hospitable than
many of its regional peers.

The authorities recognize the central role of deeper financial sector development in
fostering sustained robust growth. Enterprises in Togo identify access to credit as one of the
biggest impediments to private sector development.9 Staff stressed two complementary points:
(i) that completing the operational restructuring of the banking sector—through the privatization
process—is a crucial and pressing step for the financial sector development agenda; and (ii) that
fostering financial intermediation while maintaining financial soundness requires addressing the
current structural problems confronted by the sector (Box 6). The authorities broadly agreed and
have therefore initiated work on a financial sector development strategy, with broad stakeholder
participation and support from the IMF, the World Bank and other development partners. The
strategy will develop detailed policy recommendations to address the barriers to development for
the sector. In addition, staff encouraged the authorities to develop a strategy to address
deficiencies identified in Togo’s recent mutual evaluation report on anti money-laundering and
combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT).
IV. RELATIONS WITH THE IMF
23.
The authorities consider IMF support of their economic program an important
element in its success, and in their Letter of Intent, they request the opening of discussions
on a successor IMF-supported economic program. The expiration of the current ECF provides
an opportunity for the authorities and staff to reflect on the lessons from the current program
before launching discussions on a successor arrangement. In particular, the authorities and staff
agreed that a public seminar in Togo would provide a useful opportunity to discuss these issues
with the broad participation of domestic and external stakeholders. Public dialogue would
enhance ownership of a successor program. The authorities also emphasized that financing needs
will remain substantial over the medium-term, given large needs for social and physical
infrastructure. They have also appreciated the contribution of ongoing policy dialogue and
technical assistance to policy development and policy-making capacity.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
24.
The program has broadly achieved its objectives for growth and macroeconomic
stability in 2010. Notwithstanding numerous external shocks over the past three years—global
recession, flooding, two rounds of global oil and food price shocks, and regional political
instability—macroeconomic stability has steadily strengthened and economic growth has begun
recovering gradually. Budget execution was strong in 2010, and all performance criteria were
met by ample margins. Investment and social spending execution improved, signaling that public
expenditure management reforms under the program are beginning to bear fruit.

Box 6. Togo: Developments in the Banking Sector
The performance of the banking sector in Togo is gradually recovering, following the recapitalization
process undertaken at end-2008. Overall, the capacity of Togolese banks to play their role in financial
intermediation has improved, as shown by a recent pick-up in growth in credit to the private sector and
improvements in aggregate financial soundness indicators (Box 6 Table).
However, some banks continue to present certain vulnerabilities. As of December 2010, four out of 11
banks did not meet the new minimum capital requirements of CFAF 5 billion (about $10 million), and two
banks did not meet the required capital asset ratio of 8 percent (although the larger of these banks had a ratio
of 7.5 percent, close to the regulatory requirement). The paucity of qualified risk management personnel
continues to be a source of risks. However, profitability in the sector has recovered from the low levels
observed in 2008 and 2009, which helps reduce the risk that new financial support by the state may be
needed.

Although credit growth has recovered, intermediation efficiency remains low and interest rate
spreads have been persistently high, largely reflecting a risky business environment (Box 6 Figure).
The resumption in credit growth observed in 2009 and 2010 was relatively evenly distributed across sectors
and has not yet been accompanied by an increase in NPL ratios. The high interest rate spreads observed in
Togo could be linked to several factors, such as macroeconomic risks, high overhead costs, weak institutions
to protect creditor’s rights, and inadequate bankruptcy procedures, among others. Institutional weaknesses
are also reflected in the extremely high collateral requirements, even compared to other countries in the
region.

The improving economic performance and sound policies generally continued in
early 2011, despite the impact of the global oil price shock, particularly on fiscal policy.
Committed to maintaining a sustainable fiscal framework, the authorities are undertaking
appropriate additional fiscal measures in 2011, including beyond the program period. Concerned
with social stability, the authorities initially did not pass through the global oil price shock to
consumers, which led to a poorly targeted general price subsidy and mounting fiscal costs.
Recognizing these pressures, the authorities took corrective actions by beginning to implement a
previously adopted automatic price adjustment mechanism, with a smoothing formula, and by
partially offsetting the costs incurred with spending savings from elsewhere in the budget.
Partially offsetting the cost with spending savings helped protect fiscal sustainability, but the
quality of the adjustment was low, since the subsidy cost was offset by a reduction in more
productive investment spending. To cushion the social impact of higher prices, the authorities
also appropriately developed temporary, targeted social measures through a consultative process.
26.
The authorities have continued to make progress in key structural reforms under
the IMF-supported program, although some delays have developed in 2011, including in
important financial sector reforms. Delays have largely reflected administrative capacity
constraints and lengthier than expected legislative and consultative processes. The authorities
remain committed to completing the measures in the benchmarks, and in particular, they plan to
initiate the tendering process for the privatization of state-owned banks, a cornerstone of their
structural reforms.
27.
Staff recommends completion of the sixth review of the PRGF arrangement, on the
basis of the performance and assessment discussed above.
28.
The Article IV consultation discussions focused on fiscal and structural policies to
achieve higher economic growth while maintaining stability. The proposed temporary scaling
up of public investment in the medium-term economic framework can support growth without
compromising stability under the authorities’ current policy plans. It is important to maintain the
current financing strategy, including on concessionality, as well as revenue and spending plans.
The authorities’ ongoing efforts to improve public expenditure management, public investment
capacity, and revenue collection give cause for optimism; further success may create the
conditions in which the authorities could scale up investment further, without jeopardizing
sustainability. Stronger public finances have yielded significant and broad benefits in terms of
enhanced economic confidence; care should be taken to preserve these hard-won gains.
29.
Growth performance would benefit from a faster pace of structural reform. The
priority sectors are banking, phosphate, telecommunications and energy, where state-owned
enterprises play large roles. In particular, the contribution of the financial sector to growth ought
to be enhanced, for which bank privatization will be key. Administrative capacity constraints
have proven an obstacle to reform implementation, highlighting the relationship between growth
and public sector reform.

30
30.
Deeper structural reforms also offer the best means to enhance Togo’s
competitiveness. The real effective exchange rate is in line with fundamentals, according to
studies. Membership in the WAEMU currency zone continues to serve Togo’s economic
interests, providing a valuable anchor for stability.
31.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Togo takes place within
24 months, subject to the decision on consultation cycles (Decision No. 14747 – (10/96),
September 28, 2010).

Aggregate import and export figures, both for historical data and for projections, now include separately the imports and exports from the
bi-national electricity generating company CEB, which were previously netted out when calculating aggregate numbers. Exports from CEB
accounted for about 3 percent of GDP in 2009 and imports of CEB for about 4.4 percent of GDP.

1

Ratios to GDP reflect upward revision in nominal GDP.

2

In 2009, expenditures include social and investment spending committed in January 2009 under the 2008 supplementary budget.

3

The accounting for foreign financed spending was changed in 2010 to facilitate tracking. Instead of attempting to track foreign financed
current and investment spending separately, staff and the authorities agreed to track all foreign financed spending under investment
spending.

4

Includes the BCEAO credit for domestic arrears clearance. In 2010 domestic arrears include arrears of noncentral government
administration to electricity company; this operation could be registered as transfer.

5

In keeping with practice under the program, unidentified financing from 2012 on is calculated without assuming any external budget support
(i.e. exceptional financing).

Appendix I—Letter of Intent
Lomé, June 28, 2011
THE MINISTER

Mr. John Lipsky
Acting Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431
Dear Mr. Lipsky:
1.
Further to our letter of November 15, 2010, we take the opportunity of the sixth and final
review of the program supported by the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) to take stock of program
implementation and report on the outlook for the future.
2.
We continue to carry out our economic program and structural reforms in a generally
satisfactory manner in pursuit of our goals of maintaining macroeconomic stability and fostering
stronger and more sustained growth. The basic framework of the 2011 budget that we prepared
with Fund staff during the fifth review continues to guide our policies. However, we experienced
the exogenous shocks that we felt compelled to absorb through unplanned expenditures, which
will have an impact on the composition of our spending for the year. Nevertheless, the strategic
budgetary orientations remain unchanged in promoting faster growth, while taking account of
our desire to maintain social stability and preserve the gains of the program.
3.
Indeed, the surge in petroleum product prices occurred at the same time as we were
raising electricity prices in order to reduce the subsidies to the Togo Electricity Company
(CEET), which was running losses. Combined with high prices for imported foodstuffs, this
situation was not conducive to beginning to implement the petroleum product price adjustment
mechanism in January 2011, as planned. Despite these immediate difficulties, our economic
performance is continuing to improve, both in terms of growth and investor confidence in Togo’s
future.
Recent economic developments
4.
The economic recovery that began in 2009 strengthened in 2010, boosting real GDP
growth to 3.7 percent in a context of generally moderate inflation. This recovery was supported
primarily by a recovery in the cotton sector, buoyant activity at the Autonomous Port of Lomé
(especially the end-year increase in transit trade), and the public works launched by the
government. Inflation remained moderate at 1.4 percent in 2010 despite the surge in the

43
international prices of food and petroleum products, thanks to a satisfactory food harvest, the
predominance of subsistence agriculture, to the large share of locally produced food in the
consumption basket of the Togolese people, and the subsidization of petroleum products.
5.
According to our estimates, the current account deficit worsened to about 7.2 percent of
GDP in 2010, compared to 6.6 percent in 2009, despite an improvement in current transfers. This
is explained by a significant increase in imports, owing mainly to rising international prices for
petroleum product and imports of intermediate and capital goods associated with the start of
major infrastructure projects. The value of exports increased only moderately, due notably to a
drop in phosphate exports.
6.
The money supply grew by 16.3 percent in 2010, according to the monetary survey. This
was the result of an annual increase in domestic credit of nearly 20 percent, driven mainly by a
21.6 percent increase in credit to the economy. The rebound in economic confidence stimulated a
pick up in the lending activities of the banking system.
7.
In 2011, the government intends to continue implementing measures to accelerate growth
while preserving macroeconomic stability in a context of social peace. To this end, it plans to
speed up implementation of the public investment program already underway, and to mitigate the
impact on households of the surge in petroleum product prices, while ensuring that prices
ultimately reflect market conditions. The government also intends to continue implementing the
structural reforms that have been initiated.
Program implementation
8.
The ECF-supported economic and financial program has generally been successfully
implemented, consistent with its objectives. We have not accumulated any external arrears nor
contracted or guaranteed any nonconcessional external debt. In addition, the fiscal performance
at end-December 2010 meets the performance criteria established under the program.
Fiscal policy
Budget execution in 2010
9.
Fiscal performance in 2010 was very satisfactory, with revenue exceeding the targets set
under the program and with expenditure maintained within the agreed ceilings. Total revenue
increased by 17.6 percent in 2010 compared to 2009. This was to the result of the economic
recovery and the improved efficiency of tax administration. Nontax revenue doubled on account
of dividends and the renewal of mobile telephony licenses. Consequently, the revenue collected
reached CFAF 296.9 billion, exceeding the initial target of CFAF 267.6 billion. We have strictly
adhered to planned domestic primary expenditure, which totaled CFAF 261.9 billion, below the
programmed level of CFAF 269.3 billion. Consequently, the primary basic balance at endDecember 2010 was CFAF 34.9 billion, compared to a deficit floor of CFAF 1.8 billion under
the program. The performance criterion was thus met by a large margin.

44
10.
These results, combined with the slow pace at which our creditors are claiming payment
of the commercial arrears for which resources are available (see Paragraph 21), also enabled us
to observe the performance criterion for domestic financing by a large margin. The arrears paid
came to CFAF 36.9 billion, compared with a programmed level of CFAF 46.8 billion. Thus, net
domestic financing amounted to CFAF -10.6 billion compared to an adjusted ceiling of CFAF
36.4 billion.
The 2011 budget framework
11.
Notwithstanding the marked impact of international price shocks, particularly for
petroleum products, we are determined to continue the fiscal policy defined in our economic
program for 2011. Budget execution in the first quarter of the year proceeded normally. Tax
revenue collected amounted to CFAF 63.7 billion, or 24 percent of the target for the year as a
whole. Despite the sharp increase in investment expenditure, its execution rate has remained
stable—during the first quarter of the year, we executed 6.9 percent of the approved investment
budget compared to 5.9 percent for the same period in 2010. In turn, current expenditure is in
line with budget forecasts, except for the cost of petroleum product subsidies.
12.
Indeed, our economy sustained setbacks resulting from the changes in petroleum product
prices, to which it remains vulnerable. Petroleum product prices have a significant impact on the
cost of living and, therefore, on social stability. A surge in the prices of some imported food
products exacerbated this problem. In this context, the government felt compelled to cushion the
impact of this increase by suspending the application of automatic adjustment mechanism for
adjusting prices at the pump. However, this decision had significant impact on the State budget,
with costs totaling approximately CFAF 15.8 billion by end-May.
13.
Given that the oil price shock has proven to be more persistent than initially expected, the
government decided to begin to apply the petroleum product price adjustment mechanism in
early June. The mechanism provides for the full pass-through of world prices with some
smoothing to limit price changes to 5 percent per month and to a maximum annual increase of
30 percent. Even with these price adjustments, the additional fiscal cost in 2011, over and above
the cost incurred through May 30, 2011, will amount to about CFAF 16 billion. The total
estimated cost for the year is thus CFAF 31.8 billion. The decision to implement the automatic
fuel price adjustment was reached following a social dialogue on the impact of this policy and
accompanying mitigating measures.
14.
This dialogue resulted in an understanding to implement a number of temporary, targeted
social measures at a cost of CFAF 3.8 billion in 2011, including the suspension of direct taxes on
transporters, so as to reduce their costs, and the granting of transportation allowances for
university students, as well as government employees, pensioners, and salaried workers in the
private sector earning less than CFAF 35,000, or the equivalent of US$76, a month.
15.
In order to offset the cost of the delayed pass-through of changes in world oil prices, we
have identified, in consultation with IMF staff, investment expenditures to be deferred to the

45
2012 budget. To this end, a draft supplementary budget will be submitted to the National
Assembly.
16.
Following these changes, we have revised our expenditure targets for 2011. Regarding
domestic primary expenditures, the target for domestic primary expenditures would go from
CFAF 326.8 billion to CFAF 346.3 billion, considering the costs of subsidies to petroleum
product prices, social expenditures, and savings to be realized to finance the subsidy. As far as
revenue is concerned, the target will change from CFAF 320.2 billion to CFAF 319.8 billion. In
particular, we intend to collect all the budgeted nontax revenue, with the possible exception of
dividends from the phosphate company (SNPT). To achieve these targets, we will remain
vigilant with regard to the performance of the state-owned enterprises and, in particular, to
completing the sale of the third mobile telephony license, a process which has experienced
delays. In the event that the revenue anticipated in the 2011 budget from the sale of the third
mobile telephony license is not collected, we intend to postpone an equivalent level of
investment expenditures to the 2012 budget. Consequently, we have revised our objective for the
domestic primary deficit to CFAF 26.5 billion (1.6 percent of GDP), a budgetary framework that
remains consistent with our objectives for growth and the sustainability of public finances.
17.
The ceiling on domestic financing of the budget has been reduced, since the impact of the
delayed receipt in January by the Treasury of the disbursement associated with the fifth ECF
review exceeded the impact on the primary budget balance of the expenditures associated with
the social measures discussed above. With the new budgetary support from the AfDB (CFAF
5 billion), our financing requirements for 2011 should be covered. In order to continue to
improve the monitoring of budget execution, we have updated the quarterly indicative targets on
the execution of the 2011 budget (Table 1). We will continue to ensure strict compliance with the
ceilings on projected current and investment expenditure, and budget execution will continue to
be consistent with the financing available.
18.
In addition, public finance management reforms (see Paragraphs 20-22) should lead to
greater efficiency in expenditure planning and execution and in resource mobilization. To
implement our action plan for public finance reform, we have requested technical assistance
from the IMF, in the form of both strategic support from headquarters and operational support
from AFRITAC West. With regard to tax administration, we look forward to the arrival of an
IMF mission to take stock of the progress made so far and to propose new measures to
strengthen our reform strategy.
Implementation of the structural reforms
19.
We continued to make progress in implementing the planned structural reforms
envisaged needed to meet the objectives of the ECF-supported program. Considerable progress
has been made since the last review in December 2010 (Table 2).

46
Fiscal governance
20.
Our treasury cash management has improved considerably during the program period.
However, there is still much progress to be made in terms of cash flow forecasting. We continue
to benefit from IMF technical support through AFRITAC West and issued the decree
establishing the treasury committee in December 2010 (end-January 2011 benchmark),
thereby putting in place all the institutional structures necessary for the effective implementation
of the recommendations made to us in this area. The treasury cash management committee has
become operational.
21.
As indicated in our letter of November 2010, we have made considerable progress toward
establishing a single treasury account. We have initiated a collaborative process with donors and
the sectoral ministries with a view to devising and adopting a strategy aimed at effectively
achieving a single treasury account; this process has led to delays with respect to our objectives
(end-March 2011 benchmark). Technical assistance from the IMF will be required, as will the
collaboration of our partners, particularly as far as the project accounts are concerned. For our
part, we are now examining approaches to reducing the number of our accounts with the central
bank. With regard to commercial arrears, for which the clearing process continues, the
government has paid all creditors that have come forward to sign debt settlement agreements, for
an additional amount of CFAF 3.7 billion since the end of August 2010, when we reported to the
IMF Executive Board on developments in this regard in the context of the last program review.
However, since then the process has advanced slowly. Nevertheless, we are committed to
continue paying creditors until the end of the statute of limitations, namely end-June 2013.
22.
The reforms of our public finance systems are continuing with the support of the African
Development Bank, the European Union, and the IMF. The action plan drawn up with the
assistance of our partners is now being implemented. A crucial component of this reform, the
transposition of WAEMU directives on public financial management into national legal
provisions, is underway. The texts have already been drafted and we expect to complete this
transposition in 2011, well before the 2012 deadline established by the WAEMU Commission.
We have also named and installed customs and tax collectors. They received training from
AFRITAC West, and the start of their work should improve tax administration considerably. In
addition, the monitoring of exemptions has been strengthened by a memorandum from the
Minister of Economy and Finance aimed at limiting exemptions to only those that are granted by
the laws and regulations in force. The new customs code has been submitted to the Office of the
Secretary-General of the Government where it is currently under review. It is expected to be
adopted by end-2011.
Financial sector reform
23.
We remain committed to privatizing the four state-owned banks, although it was not
possible for us to issue the call for bids by end-April, as planned in the program (end-April 2011
benchmark). The Privatization Commission established in November 2010 met with
privatization advisors in April 2011 to initiate the process intended to identify the strategic

47
choices for the privatization and establish a timetable for the necessary steps leading up to the
sale of the equity interests of the State. The commission has proposed a privatization strategy for
adoption by the Council of Ministers, authorizing the Minister of Economy and Finance to
continue the process that will culminate in the effective privatization of the banks. In tandem
with the above, the banks’ files are being updated by the consulting firms with a view to
preparing the data room.
24.
In this context, we will launch the process of calling for expressions of interest for the
state-owned banks before the meeting of the IMF Executive Board that will examine the report
for the 6th review of the ECF. In particular, we will publish a pre-qualification notice in the
national press in the form of an advertisement (prior action), to be followed by a notice in the
international press. In addition, the receipts from the bank privatizations will be used to repay the
domestic debt, in particular the securities issued as part of the bank restructuring process, thereby
permitting a significant improvement in public debt dynamics. In collaboration with the WAMU
Banking Commission, the government also remains committed to maintaining strict control over
the management of these banks until the privatization process has been completed.
25.
The process leading to the establishment of a company to recover the nonperforming
loans acquired by the government in the context of bank restructuring is progressing, but is
taking longer than projected (end-December 2010 benchmark), as a number of legal steps had
to be taken before it could effectively become operational. These involve in particular the laws
bestowing on the asset recovery company the exceptional privileges and prerogatives of the
public authorities with regard to asset recovery. We have decided to create the company by
decree, even before the exceptional prerogatives of public authority are vested in it by law,
which will make it immediately possible to put in place the human and material resources
required for its operation. In fact, the creation of the Togo Asset Recovery Company is now
programmed to take place before end-July 2011.
26.
We have initiated the process of developing a financial sector development strategy with
technical and financial support from our development partners (including Fund staff). The
committee entrusted with preparing the strategy was established by order of the Minister of
Economy and Finance in February 2011. A national workshop for discussing and validating the
strategy is planned for September 2011.
27.
The financial and organizational audit of the Togo Retirement Fund (CRT), as well as the
actuarial study under the “Financial Sector Governance Project” financed by the World Bank,
were finalized on schedule in December 2010 (end-December 2010 benchmark). A workshop
to validate the studies was held in March 2011, and the recommendations of the report will be
examined by the government.
Real sector
28.
As regards the “one-stop window” at the Autonomous Port of Lomé, the consultant to
elaborate the roadmap identifying the steps necessary for its creation (end-September 2010

48
benchmark) was recruited with a delay, owing to problems with coordination among the various
parties involved in the process. The consultant’s conclusions should be available by end-July
2011, enabling the government to examine the recommendations and adopt a roadmap, with a
delay compared to initial plans (end-March 2011 benchmark). The government remains
committed to completing this measure.
29.
With regard to the CEET, we are committed to implementing an electricity tariff-setting
policy that takes into account the company’s costs and thus contributes to maintaining its
financial viability while minimizing fiscal risks. According to our estimates, the rate increase by
a weighted average of 20 percent (with an increase of 5-10 percent for the most vulnerable
consumers) that was introduced in January 2011, together with a government subsidy of CFAF
3 billion, should ensure that CEET operations break even in 2011. Furthermore, efforts will be
made to improve this company’s governance.
Borrowing and public debt management strategy
30.
After Togo reached the completion point of the HIPC Initiative, its debt fell to 32 percent
of GDP in 2010, not including the contingent liabilities of the various pension funds (CRT,
CNSS). In order to further enhance the sustainability of our external debt following the
completion point, we will give priority to concessional loans when borrowing externally in
accordance with our commitments to our external partners and with the pertinent procedures.
Moreover, the government will pursue a prudent fiscal policy in order to maintain debt
sustainability in the medium term, and will develop a borrowing strategy consistent with this
objective.
31.
We are in the process of developing a debt management strategy with technical support
from the IMF resident mission; it is intended to define the parameters guiding our choices of debt
instruments in the future. In this context, we appreciate the exchanges we have had with IMF
staff in the context of Article IV consultations as regards the role that the adoption of fiscal rules
could have in terms of supporting a debt management strategy and ensuring debt sustainability in
the event of an acceleration of public investment. Moreover, we will continue to enhance our
public debt management capacity with support from AFRITAC West and the World Bank.
32.
To improve the monitoring of the public debt, state-owned enterprises have begun
regularly reporting information on their external borrowing to the Ministry of the Economy and
Finance, in order to ensure that this is consistent with the government’s external borrowing
policy. In addition, a system for systematic communication between state-owned enterprises and
the debt management unit at the Ministry has been established for purposes of transmitting
monthly information on public debt service obligations.
Conclusion
33.
Togo appreciates the continuing and growing support that its development partners are
providing. In particular, cooperation with the IMF has played a decisive role in the significant
progress we have made over the past three years. The Togolese authorities are particularly

49
pleased by the successful completion of the three-year 2008-2011 program supported by the
Extended Credit Facility marked by the completion of this review. We look forward to
continuing this fruitful cooperation. To this end, we request the opening of discussions for a new
IMF-supported program.
34.
As indicated above, the objectives pursued by the ECF-supported program have been
achieved, despite the exogenous shocks and administrative capacity constraints. We hope to
consolidate the gains made under the program, and, in support of this goal, we have already
agreed on indicative benchmarks for the remainder of 2011, in cooperation with the IMF
mission. The government reaffirms its commitment to taking any additional measures necessary
for ensuring the proper implementation of its budgetary framework. The Togolese authorities
intend to consult with the IMF any possible additional measures. We request the completion of
the sixth review of the EFC-supported program and disbursement of the seventh loan tranche in
the amount of SDR 8.8 million.
35.
Finally, the government consents to the publication of this Letter of Intent and its
attachments, as well as the IMF Staff Report on the sixth review.
Very truly yours,
/s/

APPENDIX II—UPDATE OF THE DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS (DSA) USING THE LOWINCOME COUNTRY FRAMEWORK1
The analysis based on the joint IMF-World Bank debt sustainability framework for lowincome countries shows that Togo is at moderate risk of debt distress. After full HIPC
assistance, MDRI and beyond HIPC assistance, Togo’s external and public debt indicators have
improved significantly and are projected remain below the relevant thresholds in the 20-year
period under baseline assumptions, thanks to a stable economic and political climate and
rehabilitation of key sectors. However, Togo remains vulnerable to certain shocks and could
breach the policy-related thresholds for the PV of debt-to-GDP and the PV of debt-to-revenue
ratios under some alternative scenarios in the latter years.
A. Introduction
1.
The last joint DSA for Togo was prepared in November 2010 and concluded that
Togo was at moderate risk of debt distress after full HIPC assistance, MDRI and beyond
HIPC assistance. This debt sustainability analysis (LIC-DSA) for Togo assesses its external and
public debt using the forward-looking debt sustainability framework (DSF) for low-income
countries.2 The outcome of this analysis was in line with previous DSAs, finding generally
favorable debt dynamics as a consequence of expected enhancements in the macroeconomic
policy framework, notably fiscal discipline and solid implementation of growth-promoting
structural reforms. Togo reached the completion point of the HIPC Initiative in December 2010
and was granted debt relief from several multilateral and bilateral creditors. As a result, the
nominal debt stock fell from $1.7 billion at end-2009 to about $0.5 billion at end-2010.
2.
The authorities are continuing to make good faith efforts toward reaching
agreements with non-Paris Club bilateral creditors, as well as other official and
commercial creditors on the provision of debt relief on terms comparable to the relief
accorded in the context of the HIPC initiative. At the time of HIPC completion, 88 percent of
the multilateral HIPC assistance had already been fully delivered through arrears clearance and

This Appendix was prepared by Antonio C. David (AFR).

This DSA update has been prepared by Fund staff using the Debt Sustainability Framework (DSF) for Low
Income Countries (see “Applying the Debt Sustainability Framework for Low-Income Countries Post Debt
Relief”,
(http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTDEBTDEPT/PolicyPapers/21154573/DMSDR1S3149398v1DSFPape
rforweb.pdf). Togo’s quality of policies and institutions, as measured by the average World Bank’s Country
Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) for the period 2008-2010 (2.8), places it as a “weak performer”.
The corresponding indicative thresholds for the external debt indicators are 30 percent for the NPV of debtto-GDP ratio, 100 percent of the debt-to-export ratio, 200 percent for NPV of debt-to-revenue ratio,
15 percent for the debt service-to-exports ratio, and 25 percent for the debt service-to-revenue ratio.

54
concessional rescheduling of arrears. The World Bank and AfDB have provided their share of
debt relief under MDRI after the completion point. Paris Club creditors have also provided relief
in December 2010, effectively leading to a 95 percent reduction of Togolese debt towards these
creditors. China delivered its share of relief through a 2007 debt cancellation, as did Kuwait
through a 2009 loan rescheduling agreement.
3.
In the LIC-DSA framework, the present value of Togo’s public and publicly
guaranteed (PPG) external debt is $539 million at end-2010, after full delivery of HIPC,
MDRI and beyond HIPC assistance. Around 56 percent of this stock of debt is owed to
multilateral creditors and the remainder to bilateral and commercial creditors.
B. Baseline Assumptions
4.

The baseline macroeconomic assumptions for the present DSA are the following:
a.

Real GDP growth is projected to exceed its estimated long-run growth trend of around
4 percent in the period from 2012 to 2016, largely due to increases in public investment
and the fiscal deficit (see below). Subsequently, it will vary around 4 percent, driven by
the ongoing rehabilitation of the phosphate and cotton sectors, growth in the agricultural
sector (especially food production), an improved investment climate, increased financial
intermediation; additional FDI and foreign aid; and growing regional integration, thanks
to Togo’s strategic geographical location and the role of the port of Lomé. The 4 percent
potential growth was estimated based on a population growth rate of 2.5 percent (which
reflects the latest available, finalized data) and by building-up sectoral growth rates
under the assumptions outlined above and planned growth-enhancing reforms. The
estimated potential growth rate exceeds historical rates, which were depressed by the
dislocations caused by the protracted social, political, and economic crisis that the
country experienced up to the mid-2000s.

b.

Public investment is projected to accelerate starting in 2012, reaching 12.6 percent of
GDP in 2013 and 2014 and then reverting back to levels close to the ones observed in
2011. About 35 percent of this increase will be financed by loans (75 percent of which
will be concessional loans). Public investment projects are expected to be mostly
directed to infrastructure and will lead GDP growth to increase above its long-term trend
for these years.

c.

The projections for key commodity prices (oil, cotton, cocoa, and coffee) through 2016
are based on WEO projections of May 2011 and are assumed constant in real terms
afterwards.

d.

Inflation over the long-term is projected to remain stable at around 2 percent, reflecting
sound monetary policy at the regional level.

55
e.

There is a gradual improvement in the current account deficit over the medium-term,
following a deterioration in the early projection years. The deficit remains high, around
5 percent of GDP on average between 2017 and 2031, with higher exports of
phosphates, cement and clinker being insufficient to fully compensate for the growth in
imports as foreign aid is absorbed and foreign investment increases.

f.

The domestic primary fiscal deficit is assumed to stay close to zero3 during the projected
period, thereby providing a fiscal anchor to ensure fiscal sustainability over the long
term. The scaling up of public investment in 2012-14 is projected to lead to a temporary
deviation from this fiscal balance

g.

FDI and donor flows are expected to increase over the medium-term reflecting
improvements in the investment climate and overall governance.

h.

External financing is initially mostly on grant4 and highly concessional terms, with less
concessional financing gradually picking up, leading to a decrease in the grant element
of new financing (as shown in Figure 1). Concessional external financing is expected to
come largely from Togo’s traditional multilateral donors.
C. External Debt Sustainability Analysis

Baseline
5.
Under the baseline scenario, Togo’s external debt indicators remain below their
relevant indicative thresholds (Table 1a, Figure 1). The present value (PV) of public and
publicly guaranteed (PPG) debt equals to 15.2 percent of GDP in 2011 and remains below the
30 percent threshold until the end of the projected period. Furthermore, both the PV of external
debt relative to revenues and exports stay below their respective indicative threshold until 2031.
Nevertheless, the three PV ratios (under the baseline scenario) increase significantly over the
projected period. This result reflects in part conservative assumptions concerning the outer years,
particularly a declining share of concessional loans in new financing, which results in the
concessionality of new loans decreasing from 35 percent to close to 5 percent over the period

3

The primary deficit is projected to stay at around 2 percent of GDP over the projection period, with the temporary
exception of 2012-14.

The proportion of financing needs covered by grants declines from 80 percent at the beginning of the projection
period to less than 50 percent towards the end.

2011 to 2031. In fact, as shown in Table 1a, the contribution of the nominal interest rate to
endogenous debt dynamics increases significantly in the post-2016 period5.
Alternative Scenarios and Stress Tests
6.
Togo’s external debt outlook remains vulnerable to shocks especially toward the end
of the projection period (Table 1b, Figure 1). The policy thresholds for two key ratios are
breached under the most extreme stress tests. The PV of external debt to GDP indicator
deteriorates significantly under the scenario in which new loans are obtained on less favorable
terms. In this case, the threshold is breached in 2024. In addition, the PV of debt-to-revenue
ratios also surpasses the indicative thresholds at the end of the period under the “less favorable
terms” shock.
7.
In light of the results from the baseline and alternative scenarios as well as the stress
tests, IMF staff concludes that Togo still is at moderate risk of debt distress.
D. Public Sector Debt Sustainability
Baseline
8.
The inclusion of Togo’s domestic public debt in the analysis emphasizes the
vulnerabilities of the baseline scenario (Table 2a, Figure 2). Togo’s domestic debt burden
reflects years of weak fiscal management and domestic arrears accumulation, as well as the need
to recapitalize ailing banks. Much of this debt arose from losses at state-owned enterprises in the
past, highlighting the need for further reforms in the governance of these enterprises. Under the
baseline scenario, the ratios of total public debt in present value terms are projected to decrease
until 2018 before picking up gradually towards the end of the period. These trends are linked to
the assumptions regarding the concessionality of financing, with the share of grants gradually
falling and increased financing from the regional financial markets. On average, the PV of debt
to GDP ratio amounts to around 23.2 percent over the overall period. Given the assumed
improvement in the macroeconomic outlook and the cautious debt strategy in the baseline
scenario, debt ratios would remain at a reasonable level over the long-run.
Alternative Scenarios and Stress Tests
9.
The evolution of the debt indicators would be highly sensitive to the most extreme
shock--a lower growth rate—which would increase the debt level and debt service over the
long run. Total public debt dynamics are particularly vulnerable to a growth shock, which would
5

The substantial residual for endogenous debt dynamics presented in Table 1a for 2011 is largely due to exceptional
financing, price and exchange rate changes, and debt flow relief. Debt flow relief and price and exchange rate
changes also account for over half of the residuals observed in subsequent years.

57
lead the PV of debt to GDP ratio to break the 30 percent threshold by 2014 (Table 2b, Figure 2).
This highlights the importance of a reform agenda that improves the business environment to
support foreign investment and growth.6
E. Conclusion
10.
The DSA indicates that Togo is at moderate risk of debt distress after reaching the
completion point. Under the baseline scenario, the debt ratios remain below the thresholds for
the projected period, but under less positive yet realistic alternative scenarios, certain thresholds
would be breached in the latter years. These dynamics highlight the vulnerability of the Togolese
economy to certain shocks (in particular less favorable terms on new financing) and stress the
need for a prudent approach to new borrowing and continuing to seek grant and highly
concessional financing to the extent possible, as well as pursuing reforms to improve debt
management capacity. The assumptions and conclusions of the DSA were discussed with the
authorities, who broadly concurred.
11.
Maintaining a robust external debt outlook will depend on a sustained pick-up in
real GDP growth and foreign direct investment, as well as prudent debt management and
solid fiscal performance. The inclusion of Togo’s domestic debt in the analysis reinforces the
conclusions of the external DSA and stresses the risks to Togo’s debt prospects. In this context, it
is essential that the Togolese authorities continue current efforts, particularly to strengthen public
financial management (especially debt management), restructure the banking system, reform
state-owned enterprises, and improve the investment climate hence laying the foundation for
accelerating growth.

6

Note the historical scenario assumes that real GDP growth and the primary balance are set at historical averages
(over the last 10 years). In the case of Togo, this yields a primary surplus 0.6 percent of GDP for the historical
scenario, compared to a primary deficit in the baseline. As a result, gross financing needs and therefore gross new
borrowing under the historical scenario are much lower than under the baseline. The large negative new borrowing
compared to the baseline, eventually leads to negative PV ratios.

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock
(implicitly assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

APPENDIX III—LINKING PUBLIC INVESTMENT, GROWTH AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY IN TOGO1
1.
This appendix presents a brief summary of preliminary results of an application to the
Togolese economy of a dynamic general equilibrium model that analyzes the links between
public investment, economic growth and debt sustainability.2 The model constructed by Buffie
and others (2011) aims to complement the standard IMF-World Bank debt sustainability
framework for low-income countries.3 In this open-economy model, public capital is highly
productive and complementary to private capital, generating positive medium and long-run
effects from increases in public investment. Nevertheless, additional public investment does not
necessarily lead to a growth takeoff that would ensure debt sustainability by itself. The model
also allows us to analyze the risks associated with different financing options for the surge in
public investment (namely, concessional loans, external commercial loans and domestic
borrowing) and quantifies the fiscal adjustments required over the medium-term in order to
ensure debt sustainability.
2.
The model’s parameters were calibrated to match data available for the Togolese
economy. But where Togo-specific estimates were not available, the parameters were set to fit a
“generic” low income country, as described in Buffie and others (2011). Regarding crucial
parameters, the return on infrastructure investment was set at 25 percent based on the literature
regarding infrastructure investment in Africa; user fees are assumed to allow recouping about
50 percent of recurring costs for infrastructure projects;4 and we also assume a trend growth rate
of 4 percent. In the baseline model, public investment is not fully efficient, implying that every
dollar invested by the government creates less than one dollar in public “effective” capital. The
relevant parameter is set at 0.5 based on the estimates of Pritchett (2000) for sub-Saharan Africa.
In fact, the available evidence suggests relatively modest public investment efficiency in Togo,
1

This Appendix was prepared by Antonio C. David (AFR) based on joint-work with Michal Andrle (RES), Raphael
Espinoza (SPR), Marshall Mills (AFR) and Felipe Zanna (RES).
2

The full application of the model to the Togolese economy is a collaborative effort between RES, SPR and AFR
and is presented in a mimeo by Andrle, David, Espinoza, Mills and Zanna (2011), which is intended for eventual
publication as an IMF Working Paper.
3

Note that the increase in public investment simulated in the main experiment of this model application is
significantly larger than the one assumed in the medium-term macroeconomic framework presented in the Staff
Report and in the DSA presented in Appendix II. The investment scale-up considered in the main model simulations
is in part an illustration of the large infrastructure needs of a low-income country such as Togo and serves the
purpose of quantifying the resulting policy trade-offs of ambitious efforts to meet these needs, given a set of
assumptions. As discussed briefly in this appendix, we also experiment with less ambitious paths for increases in
investment (see draft Working Paper for additional details) and one of these paths is close to the public investment
increases assumed in the macro framework (namely the prudent investment scale-up scenario).

This is in line with the average estimate for sub-Saharan African countries, as discussed in Briceno-Garmendia et
al. (2008).

as the country ranks in the bottom quartile of sub-Saharan African countries in the distribution of
the index for public investment management quality (PIMI) developed by Dabla-Norris and
others (2011). This index comprises measures of the quality of appraisal, selection, management
and evaluation of public investment projects.5
3.
The first main experiment undertaken is an increase in public investment that is
heavily frontloaded in the early years. Public investment goes from an initial value of
8 percent of GDP to a peak of 17.6 percent of GDP after three years. In the baseline, the
authorities are assumed to finance the investment surge using available concessional external
financing, and through domestic taxation when this is not sufficient. There are no limits imposed
on the size or speed of fiscal adjustment and therefore tax rates increase to finance this additional
investment (beyond what is financed by concessional loans). Because taxes are distortionary in
the model, this will lead to some crowding-out of private investment. The assumptions regarding
the returns on public capital and the efficiency of public investment affect significantly the longrun effects of the public investment increase, as illustrated in Table 1.
4.
In the medium-run, access to external commercial borrowing can allow for some
smoothing of the fiscal adjustment, while still maintaining favorable debt dynamics, but
there are important risks. The trajectories for key variables over a 30 year period are plotted in
Figure 1. The fact that the government has access to additional external non-concessional
resources allows for less difficult fiscal adjustments compared to the case in which only
concessional loans are available, as indicated in the first panel of the Figure. This in turn affects
the paths of consumption and investment. In this case, there is no crowding-out of private
investment and consumption is also smoother. Nevertheless, since commercial debt is more
expensive, the risks to debt sustainability are higher. But even if the adjustment is smoother, the
size of the required tax increases is large6 and possibly not feasible or desirable for a low-income
country, like Togo.

5

Nevertheless, it is important to note that there is no direct mapping between the PIMI index (which is a relative
measure) and the efficiency parameter discussed in the model. The results presented here are broadly unchanged
when one sets the efficiency parameter at 0.4, but when efficiency is extremely low (for example when s=0.2), the
results are significantly altered.
6

The results presented in the Figure are based on a specification where consumption tax rates are not capped; but, if
taxes are capped at 22 percent of GDP, debt would follow an explosive path.

The effects are measured in percent change between the steady states, except for taxes and the crowdingin coefficient. The crowding-in coefficient is defined as the change in private capital following a change in
public capital (∆k/∆z).

5.
More modest increases in public investment would require more feasible tax
adjustments over the medium-run. When we consider model simulations of less ambitious
investment scale-ups, notably increases that are 30 percent and 70 percent smaller than the base
case, the resulting increases in consumption tax rates that are required for debt sustainability are
smaller. Consumption taxes would increase by 2.5 percent and 1 percent, respectively, when
compared to initial values.7 In fact, increases in revenue collection of this magnitude may be
feasible without raising rates if the efficiency of tax collection is improved sufficiently.
6.
The pace of the acceleration in public investment also matters, particularly in the
face of inefficiencies in investment. In alternative experiments, we also assessed the relative
merits of frontloaded increases in infrastructure investment in the presence of significant
inefficiencies in public investment compared to more gradual accelerations in investment. In the
latter case, some improvement in terms of public investment efficiency is expected to occur over
time, for example, because of the implementation of reforms to governance and public financial
management or through some form of learning by doing in terms of administrative capacity. The
results of model simulations indicate that there are welfare gains from following the gradual
approach, as the present discounted value of consumption is higher under the gradual approach
compared to the frontloaded investment path.

7

These figures refer to “feasible” caps on consumption tax rates i.e. caps that would not generate unfavorable debt
dynamics in the model where commercial external borrowing is available to smooth the fiscal adjustment.

Note: Real GDP, consumption and private investment are expressed as

adjustment falls exclusively on taxes in this specification.

7.
Overall, the results suggest that even if the macroeconomic implications of public
investment scale-ups can be favorable in the long run under certain conditions, the
transition is likely to be challenging. These conditions include a good rate of return on
infrastructure projects (25 percent); efficiency in public investment at the level of a typical subSaharan African country (50 cents in public capital for every dollar spent); and increased efforts
in revenue collection, particularly on consumption taxes, possibly by a combination of increases
in tax rates and improvement in efficiency in collection of these taxes. In this context, the model
serves as a tool to quantify the trade-offs involved in a frontloaded increase in public investment,
considering the impact of public capital on output as well as inefficiencies in public investment.
It is important to bear in mind that the conclusions obtained in the application of the model are
sensitive to the set of assumptions made. Therefore, the results of the model should be used with
care. This framework constitutes one of several useful policy tools to be utilized in an ongoing,
iterative fashion to guide assessments regarding the feasibility of investment surges.

69
8.
The model-based analysis of debt sustainability in Togo confirms that the country
remains vulnerable to adverse debt dynamics over the medium term under certain
scenarios. A very large increase in public investment would have positive macroeconomic
effects in the long-run, in particular higher output and consumption than would have been the
case otherwise. Nevertheless, it would require unrealistic increases in tax rates to ensure debt
sustainability. In light of these results, Togolese authorities could envisage more modest
increases in public investment and/or alternatively would have to obtain additional external
resources in the form of grants to finance such increases in investment. The question also arises
of the extent to which increases in investment in infrastructure should be frontloaded, even in the
presence of significant inefficiencies in public investment, as opposed to proceeding more
gradually to reap more benefits from improving the efficiency of investment through reforms to
governance and learning by doing. At the same time, given the enormous infrastructure needs,
especially in light of bottlenecks to growth, a sense of urgency in investment from policymakers
is understandable. This model allows policymakers to quantify the investment-growth nexus
(i.e., the positive impact of investment on growth and hence debt sustainability). At the same
time, we believe that, based on preliminary results of this application, policy makers should scale
up infrastructure investment in a prudent, progressive approach, as progress is achieved in public
financial management and investment capacity, more ambitious investment paths could be
considered.

APPENDIX IV—TOGO: A FRAMEWORK FOR GROWTH-SUPPORTING FISCAL RULES1
1.
This appendix explores the issues the Togolese authorities may wish to consider in
establishing a formal fiscal rule, should they decide to pursue this option. Medium-term
fiscal policy would likely benefit from carefully designed policy rules, in the context of relaxed
financing constraints following debt relief and plans for a temporary scaling up. The
commitment to a rule could anchor expectations that public finances will be sustainable,
provided the public supports the rule and there is pre-announced mechanism to adjust for
deviations. It may also help shape public debates.
2.
The current juncture in Togo may be appropriate to begin reflection on the
introduction of a rule-based fiscal framework. Fiscal consolidation is one of the achievements
of the ECF-supported program. Rules-based frameworks have typically been adopted to lock-in
successful fiscal adjustments, as prior consolidation makes the introduction of the rule more
credible; otherwise, building its credibility in the eyes of the public often takes years of
discipline.
3.
A fiscal rule is a permanent constraint on fiscal policy discretion, typically defined
in terms of an indicator of overall fiscal performance (Kopits and Symansky, 1998). Fiscal
rules are a mechanism to place durable constraints on fiscal discretion through numerical and
procedural limits on budgetary aggregates. They entail several elements: the specification of
numerical targets or ceilings on easy-to-monitor fiscal aggregates; procedures to deal with
deviations from targets; incentives for the authorities to abide by the rule; and effective
monitoring and enforcement procedures.
4.
Well-designed—and implemented—rules can strengthen a government’s
accountability and enhance the quality, transparency, and credibility of fiscal policy.
However, while fiscal rules can be a useful tool to improve fiscal management, their
prerequisites (adequate public financial management systems and strong government ownership)
suggest that they are not appropriate for every country to adopt. In some cases, the introduction
of a rule can even have negative consequences for the conduct of fiscal policy. This may happen
because the pre-conditions specified above are not met, or because the rule that may be desirable
in the long-run may be counterproductive in the short-run.
5.
In the case of Togo, one main long-term anchor is currently clear—the WAEMU
basic fiscal balance. The basic balance is appropriate as a criterion of fiscal convergence to
sustain the monetary union. The value of fiscal convergence criteria has been highlighted by the
recent experience of other monetary unions. The question for the Togolese authorities to consider
is the following: does the basic fiscal balance fully meet their objectives by itself? In particular,
1

72
the chosen anchor should respect not only the WAEMU fiscal convergence objectives, but also
the Togolese authorities’ other fiscal and macroeconomic policy objectives. How important is it
to achieve a target level of public investment to bridge the infrastructure gap or to be able to
conduct counter-cyclical fiscal policy? How important is it to raise social spending with the
objective to achieve the Millennium Development Goals?
6.
By excluding foreign-financed investment spending, the basic fiscal balance already
gives considerable room to increase investment spending. However, because of this
exclusion, the anchor on the basic balance does not establish a reasonably good check on debt
accumulation, thus not necessarily ensuring fiscal sustainability by itself.
7.
The exclusion of foreign financed-investment spending from the basic fiscal balance,
combined with experience elsewhere, would argue for complementing the anchor on the
basic balance with an anchor on total debt. In this context, it is arguable that the current
WAEMU convergence criterion that total debt should be lower than 70 percent of GDP appears
too high for a country at Togo’s level of capacity, particularly given its new debt situation
following HIPC debt relief. Togo’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) index
was 2.4 in 2009, classifying Togo as having low institutional and policy design capacity in the
context of the Debt Sustainability Framework (IMF and IDA, 2010). For countries with a CPIA
below 3.25, the DSF sets a threshold of the NPV of external debt to GDP of 30 percent, above
which the country is considered at risk of debt distress.
8.
In choosing an appropriately safe level of debt, the authorities should be mindful of
liquidity risk. While membership to WAEMU provides some protection against excessive
external debt denominated in a foreign currency, Togo’s current low debt and cash management
capacity, as well as low PFM scores in general, would argue in favor of setting—for purely
domestic policy purposes—a lower debt threshold than the 70 percent prescribed by WAEMU.
Another argument in favor of targeting a lower debt ratio is that Togo is also exposed to a
revenue risk, as it has a low revenue-to-GDP ratio, a factor associated to several cases of debt
distress.
9.
Once the Togolese authorities have chosen a reasonably low debt-to-GDP ratio, it is
possible to derive a primary deficit that would stabilize public debt at that specific level
over the long run.2

2

The primary deficit (revenue minus expenditures plus interest payments) is suggested here as a possible
computational rule, because it is closely related to debt sustainability. Under current WAEMU rules, the
convergence criterion on the deficit is the basic fiscal balance, which is defined by WAEMU Act 04/99 as total
revenue minus current expenditure and domestically financed capital spending. For reference, the key fiscal target
under the ECF-supported program is the domestic primary balance, which is defined as revenue minus expenditures
plus foreign-financed spending and interest payments.

73
10.
The authorities could also safeguard domestic investment by excluding it from the
deficit anchor, at least temporarily. In this way they would be applying a “golden-rule” type
anchor. The advantage of this rule is that a key policy objective of the authorities (i.e., raising
investment spending to close the infrastructure gap) would be safeguarded. However, this anchor
has three main drawbacks. First, it is not directly linked to debt accumulation. It is thus important
to complement it with an anchor on total debt. Second, the exclusion of any category of
spending, be it domestic investment or social spending, comes at a cost, as the rule becomes less
transparent. There is a clear trade-off between the simplicity of the rule and the need to protect
investment spending by excluding it from the rule. Third, the exclusion of any category of
spending establishes the strong incentive for government to engage in creative accounting,
shifting allocation from a monitored category to an excluded category. Thus, this exclusion could
be pursued only when supported by improvements in public financial management, in particular
in the classification, reporting, and monitoring of government operations.
11.
The experience of WAEMU countries highlights how the constraint on the basic
fiscal balance has not provided good guidance for fiscal policy in the presence of output
and terms of trade shocks. In a currency union, the design of rules needs to be cognizant of the
needed flexibility in fiscal policy, as it remains the only available tool for macroeconomic
stabilization.
12.
Thus, the Togolese authorities should consider superimposing time frame
regulations, or rules, on the fiscal anchor, to make the rule more flexible. A time rule defines
the number of years over which the anchor needs to be respected, thus allowing for the
temporary departure from the anchor within the limits defined by the time rule. This gives
medium-term, counter-cyclical flexibility to the rule and to policymakers, thus considerably
enhancing the likelihood of rule’s success. For example, the time rule might specify that the
basic balance target should be respected, cumulatively, in the course of an agreed number of
years, say, for example 5 years. In other words, the sum of fiscal balances over the 5-year period
has to be equal to or above zero. Under this time rule, a government can chose, on any given
year, a level of budget deficit/surplus, provided that the sum of the fiscal balances over the five
year period respects the anchor. Figure 1 below shows three examples of possible fiscal balance
path under this time rule. Many more are of course possible.3 Thus, the government has
considerably more medium-term flexibility on how to counter exogenous shocks.

3

Since the sum of all fiscal balances in the 5-year period has to equal zero, any fiscal path chosen under this
particular time rule produces no change in the stock of debt by the end of the period.

13.
To enhance flexibility further, the authorities could also adopt clearly defined
escape clauses and buffers. An escape clause addresses major shocks (those shocks the country
just cannot absorb without abandoning the fiscal rule), or deals with the budgetary impact of
major structural reforms (e.g., civil service reforms). The buffers instead are built in the rule to
pre-empt the impact of minor shocks and economic fluctuations.
14.
However, the mere introduction of a fiscal rule would not guarantee success, unless
the authorities establish costs to breaking the rule that are higher than the benefits of
respecting it. An essential element of a rule is that it has to be perceived as costly for the
government to break it. The cost of deviating from the rule can be set through formal sanctions
or through the adverse reputational impact of reneging to a formal commitment. Sanctions are
rarely a chosen avenue, as they require effective autonomous enforcement. Formal procedures
raising the reputational cost and/or mandating corrective actions are preferable. The authorities
could consider raising the reputational costs in various ways, including an obligation to publicly
explain deviations and what the government intends to do to return within the path prescribed by
the rule.
15.
Fiscal Responsibility Laws (FRLs) are useful in this context, and the authorities
could consider exploring the possibility of a basic FRL in the medium-term. These are
usually focused on government accountability. In a rule-based framework, FRLs often clarify
under what conditions the government can depart from the anchor prescribed by the rule and
how to return to it (escape clauses and buffers).

75
16.
A key ingredient to the success of rule-based frameworks is ownership. It is thus
important to introduce a rule-based framework for fiscal policies only if there is broad-based
support for the authorities for the advantages associated to subjecting fiscal policies decisions to
rules. International experience shows that this is indeed the case, provided the rules are tailored
to the economic conditions and specific policy objectives of the country, including allowing for
flexibility to respond to shocks. Adequate public financial management is another important
element to consider; on this point, Togo has made considerable progress, although continued
progress is highly desirable.

income earned on the amount committed at the decision point but not disbursed during the interim period.

VIII. Exchange Arrangement
Togo is a member of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) and has no
separate legal tender. The exchange system, common to all WAEMU countries, is free of
restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions. The
union’s common currency, the CFA franc, is pegged to the euro at a rate of
CFAF 655.957 = EUR 1, consistent with the official conversions rate of the French franc to the
euro and the previous fixed rate of the CFA franc to the French franc of CFAF 100= F 1. On
April 28, 2006, the rate of the CFA franc in terms of SDR was CFAF 769.68 = SDR 1.0.
Effective January 1, 2007, the exchange arrangement of the WAEMU countries has been
reclassified to the category of conventional pegged arrangement from the category of exchange
arrangement with no separate legal tender. The new classification is based on the behavior of the
common currency, whereas the previous classification was based on the lack of a separate legal
tender. The new classification thus only reflects a definitional change, and is not based on a
judgment that there has been a substantive change in the exchange regime or other policies of the
currency union or its members
IX. Safeguards Assessments
The Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) is the common central bank of the countries
of the West African Economic and Monetary Union, which includes Togo. The most recent
safeguards assessment of the BCEAO was completed on March 1, 2010. The 2010 update

80

assessment found that the BCEAO continues to have controls in place at the operational level.
The overall governance framework needed nonetheless to be strengthened by the addition of an
audit committee to ensure that the Board of Directors exercises appropriate oversight over the
control structure, including the audit mechanisms and financial statements. The Institutional
Reform of the WAMU and the BCEAO completed after the approval of the safeguards report
stipulated creation of the Audit Committee, which should now start working. Efforts to
implement fully the International Financial Reporting Standards reporting framework should also
be pursued.

APPENDIX II—JOINT MANAGEMENT ACTION PLAN
1. The Fund Togo team led by Mr. Mills (mission chief) held a discussion with the
World Bank Togo team led by Ms. Manuela Francisco (senior country economist)
on March 7, 2011, to identify macro-critical structural reforms and coordinate the two
teams’ work for the period January 2011-December 2011.
2. The teams agreed that Togo’s main macroeconomic challenges are to accelerate
economic recovery, while maintaining sound policy to support financial and
macroeconomic stability, particularly in the face of shocks. To meet these challenges,
Togo needs to accelerate structural reforms (in particular in the financial and phosphate
sectors and in the area of public financial management).
3. The teams have the following requests for information from their counterparts:


The Fund team requests to be kept informed of progress in the above macrocritical structural reform areas and preparation of the Interim Strategy Note.
Timing: when milestones are reached (and at least semi-annually).



The Bank team requests to be kept informed of the Fund’s assessments of
macroeconomic policies and prospects.

4. Disbursement dates for general budget support targeted by staffs:
IMF:
SDR 8.8 million

APPENDIX III—STATISTICAL ISSUES
1. Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance, but weaknesses in the quality and
timeliness of data hamper staff’s analysis. National accounts and balance of payments statistics
are compiled based on very limited information, with only few surveys and scarce data on
primary agriculture and private sector services. Moreover, government finance statistics are
derived from a weak accounting and reporting system, and monetary data are reported by the
BCEAO with a two-month lag.
2. The country has participated in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) since
November 2001. Metadata on the national statistical system, including plans for improvement
posted to the Fund’s Dissemination Standard Bulletin Board, were last updated in December
2004.
National accounts and consumer price index (CPI)
3. Like other West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) member states, Togo
had embarked in late 2002 on implementing the System of National Accounts 1993 (1993 SNA),
using the ERETES software. The NA for the new base year (2000) were completed in 2005, but
in 2006 due to a number of difficulties such as lack of staff, material and financial resources, the
program was suspended and the NA for 2001 was not finalized. Only in March 2009 did the
implementation process resume and the Direction Générale de la Statistique et de la Comptabilité
Nationale (DGSCN) started working on the compilation of data for 2007 (the most recent year
for which enough data was available). Since then, several AFRITAC West and AFRISTAT
missions have assisted in the completion of data collection, in the preparation of source data, in
ensuring consistency across primary data sources, and in preparing preliminary accounts.
Estimates of production in the informal sector were also produced. The efforts related to end2010 population census exercise, which required the full attention of staff in the DGSCN, have
further delayed the completion of the 2007 National Accounts. Furthermore, a May 2011
AFRITAC West TA report pointed to serious anomalies in the provisional 2007 NA (concerning
value added in the informal sector, low fixed capital formation, high consumption to GDP ratio,
among others), which were corrected during the mission. Authorities remain committed to
achieving the objectives of finalizing the national accounts referring to the years up to 2010
before June 2012, despite the delays. The CPI basket was revised in 2010. The WAEMU
commission, supported by AFRISTAT and the BCEAO, launched a revision of the harmonized
CPI basket in the region in 2008. The reform included expanding CPI surveys, and updating the
weights of various sub-components to reflect consumption habits.
External sector statistics
4. Balance of payments statistics and international investment position data are compiled based
on bank reports, a survey of enterprises, and customs data. Statistics are compiled following the
principles of the 5th balance of payment manual, with a six-month delay and are revised twice a
year. Export figures, net of transit trade, are appropriately reported since the latest STA technical
assistance mission in balance of payments statistics in 2008. The Central bank continues its

90

efforts for a better covering of informal trade notably with the subregional unit for the
reconciliation of intra-WAMU trade. Data provided by BCEAO headquarters on the treatment of
regional banknotes need to be reviewed at Headquarters level.
Government accounts and public debt data
5. The Government finance statistics accounting system is undergoing improvements. The new
WAEMU budget nomenclature now permits the economic and ministerial classification of
expenditure, with functional classification under development. The monthly TOFE (Table of
Central Government Financial Operations) is based on a mixture of administrative and
accounting data and is sent to AFR with a two-month lag. Inconsistencies in domestic arrears
records held by different units of the Ministry of Finance and the stock of domestic debt have
been audited and a new database is now set up. Comprehensive external debt data and
projections on a loan by loan basis are compiled regularly. Only budgetary central government
data are reported for publication in the Government Finances Statistics Yearbook (GFSY),
government finance high frequency data are not reported for publication in the IFS.
Monetary statistics
6. Monthly data for Togo, along with data for other members of the West African Monetary
Union are regularly disseminated by the Central Bank of the West African Monetary Union
(BCEAO) with a lag of about two months. Data on lending and borrowing rates, charged by
domestic banks, are now compiled and available monthly.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2001 Article IV Consultation with
Togo
On July 18, 2011, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Togo.1 The Executive Board also completed the sixth review
of Togo’s performance under its Extended Credit Facility (ECF) arrangement.
Background
Since the conclusion of the last Article IV consultation in April 2009, Togo has made further
progress in overcoming the legacy of its protracted 1990-2005 domestic crisis. Despite an
adverse global economic environment, growth has continued to accelerate, reaching
3.7 percent in 2010. Economic Growth nevertheless remains modest relative to population
growth and to other countries in the region. Average inflation in 2010 remained modest at
1.4 percent, thanks largely to abundant local food production and limited pass-through of
higher global oil prices. The current account deficit has widened owing to higher oil prices
and imports of intermediate and capital goods, reflecting in part higher public investment
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of
the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

93
spending. Public finances have strengthened markedly, given the external debt relief under
the Highly Indebted Poor Countries Initiative (HIPC) and prudent fiscal policy.
The Togolese authorities have built a strong record of implementation of their IMFsupported economic program. With the conclusion of the sixth review of its ECF
arrangement, Togo has successfully completed its three-year program in a timely manner.
In 2010, budget execution was particularly strong, with all fiscal performance criteria met by
ample margins. Revenue collection improved, and current expenditures remained within
program ceilings. The execution of priority social spending and of capital projects improved
substantially in 2010, nearly reaching ambitious targets.
The conduct of fiscal policy in 2011 was complicated by the mounting subsidies following
the non-adjustment of fuel pump prices, notwithstanding global higher prices. In June, the
authorities began gradual fuel price adjustments and initiated targeted social measures,
developed in consultation with stakeholders, to cushion the impact on the vulnerable
population. To offset partially the budgetary cost of fuel subsidies, the authorities postponed
some lower-priority investment spending to 2012. Overall, the budget stance has become
somewhat more accommodative in 2011, targeting a domestic primary deficit of 1.6 percent
of GDP, rather than 0.4 percent previously. Fiscal balances for 2008-2011 have
nevertheless remained consistent on average with the authorities’ initial target for the
program, as a result of the overperformance in 2010.
Structural reforms to address weaknesses stemming from the domestic crisis have
advanced since 2009, although progress has been slower than planned in some key areas.
While improvements in public financial management have generally proceeded well, reform
efforts have not yet yielded desired results in other sectors, such as phosphates and
banking. In particular, the privatization process for the four largest state-owned banks—a
key step to improve their soundness, protect public finances and promote financial
intermediation—is taking longer than anticipated, in part due to the need to establish an
inclusive consultative mechanism to make strategic choices on the privatization process.
Following these decisions, the authorities re-energized the privatization process by issuing
a call for expressions of interest in the local and international media. The authorities remain
committed to seeking strategic investors and aim to bring the banks to the point of sale
before end-2011.
For the medium-term, the authorities are emphasizing policies to strengthen the foundations
for growth. To address infrastructure bottlenecks, the authorities intend to scale up public
investment by around 2½ percent of GDP a year in 2012-2014, while maintaining
macroeconomic stability and debt sustainability. With the objective of mobilizing more
domestic resources for priority social and investment spending, the authorities intend to
redouble efforts to modernize tax and customs administration and reduce tax exemptions.
Despite Togo’s considerable progress in economic stabilization, it remains vulnerable, and
risks persist. Worsening of external price shocks would lead to deterioration in growth, the
current account, price stability, and the budget. Persistent constraints in administrative

94
capacity could delay implementation of reforms designed to address key obstacles to
growth, thereby postponing recovery.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors agreed with the thrust of the staff appraisal. They commended the
authorities for the strong track record and successful completion of the ECF-supported
program, despite the adverse shocks and limited administrative capacity. Economic growth
has picked up, bolstered by countercyclical fiscal policy in 2010 and progress in
implementing the reform agenda. Directors stressed that continued commitment to preserve
fiscal sustainability and address underlying structural weaknesses is critical to boosting
growth potential. They welcomed the authorities’ intention to remain closely engaged with
the Fund and development partners in order to consolidate the gains achieved thus far.
Directors welcomed the implementation of the automatic mechanism for adjusting retail
prices for oil products, accompanied by targeted measures to cushion the social impact.
They supported the emphasis of the medium-term fiscal framework on scaling up
investment in infrastructure and priority social spending. Directors underscored the need to
be vigilant about potential shortfalls in revenue and the quality of public projects. Adopting a
rules-based framework anchored on the fiscal deficit and debt level would be helpful in this
regard. Directors encouraged further efforts to strengthen public financial management,
revenue collection, and management of contingent liabilities, with technical support from
development partners. They noted that Togo remains at moderate risk of debt distress,
calling for improved capacity in debt management, and a financing strategy that relies on
grants and highly concessional loans.
Directors considered speeding up bank privatization to be central to the reform agenda—a
key step to improve access to credit and promote private sector growth. They also stressed
that a financial sector development strategy is a high priority in this area, and welcomed its
preparation in cooperation with stakeholders and with technical assistance from the Fund.
Directors underlined the importance of broader and deeper structural reforms to boost
competitiveness and productivity growth, and reduce poverty. Efforts should focus on
improving the business climate, increasing investment in physical and human capital, and
enhance governance in public sector operations. Directors noted that membership in the
West African Economic and Monetary Union has provided an important anchor of stability,
particularly in the face of recent external shocks.

IMF Executive Board Completes Sixth and Final Review Under the ECF Arrangement for
Togo and Approves US$13.95 Million Disbursement
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today completed the sixth and
final review of Togo’s economic program supported by the Extended Credit Facility (ECF). The
approval will enable an immediate disbursement in an amount equivalent to SDR 8.8 million
(about US$13.95 million), bringing total disbursements under the arrangement to an amount
equivalent to SDR 95.41 million (about US$151.21 million).
The Executive Board also concluded the 2011 Article IV consultation. Details of the findings of the
Article IV will be published in a Public Information Notice in due course.

The ECF Arrangement for Togo was approved on April 21, 2008 (See Press Release No. 08/90).
The authorities have requested the opening of discussions on a successor IMF-supported economic
program.

Following the Executive Board's discussion, Ms. Nemat Shafik, Deputy Managing Director and
Acting Chair, said:
“The Togolese authorities have maintained a strong track record of program implementation.
The strong budget execution in 2010 was commendable. The execution of domestically financed
public investment and priority social spending has improved. Growth has picked up in large part
as a result of these developments.
“After delaying the pass-through of higher global oil prices to consumers, the authorities began
implementing the automatic pricing mechanism in June, to limit the budgetary impact of the fuel
subsidies. The mechanism aims to minimize economic distortions and safeguard public finances,
while targeted measures cushion the social impact of higher fuel prices.
“The medium-term budget framework appropriately emphasizes increasing public investment to
support growth, to be financed largely by domestic revenue, grants, and highly concessional
external loans. This ambitious approach puts a premium on the quality of investment projects,
public financial management reforms and revenue administration efforts.

“The authorities are committed to accelerating broad-based structural reforms aimed at boosting
competitiveness and potential growth. It is particularly important to proceed expeditiously with
the recently reinvigorated privatization process for the four largest state-owned banks, which will
lead to a sounder and more efficient banking sector. Other priorities are maintaining a
sustainable fiscal policy, reforming public enterprises, increasing investment in physical and
human capital, and improving the business climate,” Ms. Shafik added.

Statement by Kossi Assimaidou, Executive Director for Togo
Monday, July 18, 2011
I. INTRODUCTION
I would like to thank the Executive Board, Management and Staff for their continued support to
my Togolese authorities in their efforts to implement sound policies and far-reaching reforms
under the ECF-supported program. Fund’s support and my authorities’ firm commitment to the
program led Togo to meet the HIPC completion point requirements and to receive debt relief
under the HIPC and MDRI initiatives in 2010. In addition, Togo has reengaged with the
international community and restored macroeconomic stability while broader economic
performance is improving. My Togolese authorities are particularly pleased by the successful
completion of their first three-year (2008-2011) economic program supported by the ECF.
Going forward, my authorities remain determined to persevere with prudent policies and deepen
structural reforms while continuing to benefit from the support of the Fund and other partners. In
this regard, the authorities request the opening of discussions for a new IMF-supported program
in order to further strengthen their current reform agenda, enhance public finance management,
and promote the development of a strong financial sector.
II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION
The Togolese economic performance has continued to improve despite the difficult external
environment, which includes regional instability, the slow recovery of the world economy, and
the surge in international fuel and food prices. Real GDP growth has increased to reach 3.7
percent in 2010 and is projected to increase further to 3.9 percent in 2011, reflecting, among
others, the recovery in the cotton sector coupled with buoyant activity at the Port Autonome de
Lomé and public investments in infrastructure. Inflation declined to 1.4 percent in 2010 from 1.9
percent in 2009. The current account deficit increased slightly to 7.2 percent of GDP from 6.6
percent in 2009 following the drop in phosphate exports and the rising international fuel and
food prices. Significant increase in imports of intermediate and capital goods for infrastructure
projects has also contributed to widening the external deficit.
In the fiscal area, performance in 2010 was strong, as targets set out in the program were met
with considerable margins. Total revenue increased by 17.6 percent in 2010, exceeding the
program’s objectives owing to the economic recovery and improved efficiency of tax
administration. Public expenditure was executed within the program’s ceilings. No external
arrears were accumulated and no nonconcessional external debt contracted. Payments of
commercial arrears due to domestic creditors have also been pursued. Considerable progress has
been made in the fiscal reform area since the last program review in December 2010, which was

100

instrumental in meeting the objectives of the ECF-supported program. In December 2010, the
authorities have established the treasury committee that has become operational since then.
On structural reforms, the authorities have completed a financial and organizational audit of the
public sector workers’ pension fund, as well as the subsequent actuarial study on it, with the
view to tackling the pension system sustainability problem. Regarding the privatization process
of state-owned banks, my authorities have very recently issued a call for expressions of interest.
Other structural measures—notably the adoption of a roadmap for the establishment of a onestop window at the Port and the setting up of a mechanism to recover non performing loans—
have seen progress in implementation. A few measures encountered delays, mostly due to
technical capacity constraints, as well as legal and consultative process requirements taking
longer than initially envisaged. These processes are nevertheless necessary to establish firm legal
ground and broad public support for reform.
Based on the continued good performance of Togo in implementing its program and the
authorities’ strong commitment to pursue implementing structural reforms to accelerate growth
and preserve macroeconomic stability, I request Directors’ support for the completion of the
sixth review of Togo’s program under the ECF arrangement.
III. POLICIES AND REFORMS FOR 2011
Fiscal policy
My Togolese authorities will continue to build on the strong record of fiscal policy and structural
reform implementation. In this respect, the basic framework of the 2011 budget discussed with
staff will guide their policy measures and reforms despite the difficult environment marked by
the rising international oil and food prices.
Mindful of the need to stem the budgetary strains resulting from the global changes in the fuel
prices in particular, the authorities have begun implementing an automatic petroleum price
adjustment mechanism to reflect the market prices and preserve government finances. The
decision to implement this adjustment mechanism was reached after a far-reaching social
dialogue on the impact of this policy and accompanying measures notably in favor of the most
vulnerable segments of the population. Accordingly, pump prices were adjusted in June. More
recently, significant social demands—reminiscent of the movements that led to violent protests
in 2009—have risen, including demands for greater government support to vulnerable
populations in face of the unprecedented costs of petroleum products. My authorities favor a
pragmatic approach to responding to these social demands. To offset partially the budgetary cost
of the delay in passing through changes in international oil prices, the authorities have identified,
in consultation with staff, expenditures that could be deferred to the 2012 budget.

101

Based on these changes, the expenditure and revenue targets have been revised for 2011. The
authorities will make every effort to collect all the budgeted nontax revenue while remaining
vigilant with regard to the performance of the state-owned enterprises. Despite the considerable
time required to put in place an adequate regulatory framework, the authorities plan to complete
the sale of the third mobile telephone license.
Based on these measures, the domestic primary deficit was also revised. Nevertheless, this
budgetary framework remains consistent with the authorities’ objectives for growth and the
sustainability of public finances. Strongly determined to continue improving the monitoring of
budget execution, the authorities have updated the quarterly indicative targets on the execution of
the 2011 budget. They will also continue to ensure strict compliance with the ceilings on
projected current investment expenditure while paying due attention to the consistency of the
budget execution with the availability of financing.
Borrowing and public debt management strategy
In order to further enhance the sustainability of Togo’s external indebtedness, the authorities will
pursue a prudent fiscal policy. They also remain committed to prudent borrowing and sound
public debt management. In this regard, they will continue to rely on grants and concessional
loans for external financing. In addition, the SOEs have begun to report regularly information on
their external borrowing to the Ministry of Economy and Finance with a view to ensuring that
their borrowing is consistent with the government’s external loan policy.
Financial sector reform
My authorities agree with the need to develop a vibrant and sound financial system to further
increase the financing of the private sector development. To this end, they have initiated, with
the support of development partners including the Fund, a process for developing a financial
sector development strategy. In order to discuss and validate this strategy, a national workshop is
planned to take place in September 2011.
The Togolese authorities remain committed to privatizing the four state owned-banks as reflected
by the issuance of a presidential decree stating the government’s privatization strategy. Under
this strategy, the majority of banks’ capital will be allocated to strategic investors. Following this
important step in the banks’ privatization process, the authorities published on July 7, 2011 in the
national and international press a pre-qualification notice in the form of advertisement for the
privatization of the four banks namely BIA-Togo, BTCI, BTD and UTB. The demands for the
pre-qualification should be transmitted to the Privatization National Commission by September
9, 2011. The authorities intend to use the receipts from the bank privatization to repay the
domestic debt, in particular, the securities issued as part of the bank restructuring process. In the
meantime, they will continue maintaining strict control over the management of these banks, in

102

close collaboration with the WAMU Banking Commission and until the completion of the
privatization process.
Furthermore, following the workshop held in March 2011 to validate the financial and
organizational audit as well as the actuarial study of the Togo Retirement Fund (CRT), the
authorities are analyzing the recommendations of the reports with a view to ensuring their
adequate implementation.
Structural reforms and competitiveness
The Togolese authorities will continue focusing their efforts on needed structural reforms to
sustain macroeconomic stability, increase growth and reduce poverty, and preserve
competitiveness.
Efforts to establish a single treasury account are underway, and technical assistance from the
IMF and the collaboration of development partners will be required, given the impact of the
measure on the projects’ accounts. The reforms of Togo’s public finance systems are continuing
with the support of the African Development Bank, the European Union and the IMF. The action
plan drawn to implement these reforms is now being implemented and the transposition of
WAEMU directives on public financial management into national legal provisions is underway.
The government will adopt the new customs code by end-2011.
In their efforts to simplify the procedures at the Port Autonome de Lomé, the authorities have
decided to accelerate the creation of the “one stop window”. Despite the delays experienced in
this endeavor, the authorities remain committed to completing this measure as soon as the
roadmap identifying the steps necessary for this initiative and related recommendations are
available by end-July 2011.
With regard to the Compagnie Energie Electrique du Togo (CEET), the authorities are
committed to completing an electricity tariff-setting policy taking into account the company’s
cost and aiming to maintain its financial viability and to minimize fiscal risks. In this respect, a
tariff increase by a weighted average of 20 percent was introduced in January 2011. In addition,
the authorities will pursue their efforts to further improve the governance of the company.
Given the need to improve the country’s infrastructure and meet its development challenges, the
authorities plan to speed up the implementation of their public investment program while
preserving macroeconomic stability and strengthening the business environment.
IV. CONCLUSION
My Togolese authorities appreciate the constructive cooperation with the IMF, which under the
implementation of the ECF-supported program has played a decisive role in enhancing the public

103

finance management, restoring economic growth and confidence in Togo, and deepening
structural reforms. They are strongly committed to consolidate the gains made under the ECFsupported program. In this respect, they look forward to opening negotiations for a new Fundsupported arrangement. They intend to hold a high-level seminar to draw lessons from the
current program, with the broad participation of all and the support of the Fund. My authorities
are also hopeful that the Fund, other international financial institutions and development partners
will continue to assist them in their efforts.
