• Discussions for the 2004 Article IV consultation were held in Quebec City and Toronto during
November 5-7, and in Ottawa during November 12–19, 2003. The staff team comprised C. Towe
(Head), M. Mühleisen, R. Cardarelli, R. Luzio (all WHD), and A. Kose (RES). Mr. Singh and
Mr. Collyns attended the concluding meeting on November 19. Mr. Bennett (Executive Director) and
his Advisor, Mr. Kruger, participated in the discussions.
• The team met with representatives from both the public and private sectors. Discussions were held
with Bank of Canada Governor Dodge and Deputy Finance Minister Lynch, as well as other senior
officials from Finance Canada, the Bank of Canada, the Office of the Superintendent of Financial
Institutions, Health Canada, Human Resources Canada, the provinces of Ontario and Quebec, and the
Ontario Securities Commission. The team also met with the major banks, the Toronto Stock Exchange,
and the Canadian Labour Congress.
• The staff report for the 2003 Article IV consultation was considered by the Executive Board on
January 31, 2003 and was subsequently published as IMF Country Report No. 03/33. Executive
Directors broadly endorsed the authorities’ inflation targeting framework. While they saw a gradual
withdrawal of monetary stimulus as the most likely course, they welcomed the commitment to act even
more decisively if inflation pressures intensified. Directors commended the authorities’ prudent fiscal
management but cautioned that looming demographic pressures required the debt ratio be kept on a
steady downward trajectory and emphasized that reforms to the health care system would need to be
consistent with longer-term fiscal constraints. Directors also noted the continuing need to promote
employment and productivity, including through further reforms of the Employment Insurance system,
as well as agricultural and trade policies. Directors welcomed the authorities’ efforts to strengthen
corporate governance, with some Directors suggesting the establishment of a more unified system of
securities regulation.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
At the time of last year’s consultation, Canada’s macroeconomic performance was
highly favorable and policies were broadly consistent with past Fund advice (Appendix I).
The economy had weathered the global downturn and geopolitical uncertainties, and growth
had outstripped that in other G-7 countries by substantial margins. The central bank had
begun to raise interest rates in the face of signs that the output gap was closing, while fiscal
policy remained geared toward sustaining surpluses and debt reduction, notwithstanding
significant new spending initiatives and tax cuts.
2.
However, the macroeconomic and policy environment during the past year has
been more difficult than anticipated. A series of negative shocks caused the economy to
slow sharply in the second half of 2002 and into 2003. These shocks, as well as increased
outlays in support of the public health care system, have eroded federal fiscal surpluses. With
the economy weakening, the Canadian dollar appreciating sharply, and inflation falling back
to well within the 1-3 percent target range, the Bank of Canada has recently reversed course
and lowered interest rates.
3.
Although the outlook is broadly favorable, challenges remain. While leading
indicators suggest growth will regain momentum, considerable uncertainty remains regarding
the extent to which the sharp appreciation of the Canadian dollar will weigh on net exports
and the economy’s return to full employment. Broader questions exist, too, regarding the
extent to which Canada’s favorable growth performance in the face of the global IT and
stock market bust of recent years reflected a durable increase in productivity growth or more
transient factors such as an undervalued exchange rate, the strength of U.S. household
demand, and Canada’s relatively modest IT and investment boom.
4.
Against this background, the discussions focused on the policies needed to foster
the recovery while supporting fiscal sustainability and productivity growth. In the near
term, with inflation low and limited scope for countercyclical fiscal policies given the
commitment to balanced budgets, monetary policy will need to remain accommodative. The
priority for fiscal policy remains to sustain debt reduction and prepare for impending
demographic pressures on retirement and health care systems. At the same time, continued
financial sector, labor, trade, and other structural policy reforms are needed to strengthen
Canada’s growth potential and to take full advantage of the increased integration of North
American markets.
II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
5.
After slowing only modestly during the global downturn, Canada’s macroeconomic
situation weakened during the past year. During 2000-2002, Canada’s real GDP growth
averaged 3½ percent—almost twice the G-7 average—reflecting the effects of a depreciated
exchange rate and low interest rates on net external and domestic demand (Tables 1 and 2).
However, the economy’s momentum began to slacken late in 2002. Activity contracted by
¾ percent (annual rate) in the second quarter of 2003, and only achieved 1 percent growth

-4-

in the third quarter. Labor market conditions
also deteriorated, with significant job losses
registered in the manufacturing sector, labor
incomes slowing in real terms, and the
unemployment rate moving up to 8 percent,
before dropping to 7½ percent by end-2003.
6.
Several factors have weighed on
activity. The SARS outbreak dampened
domestic demand and tourism receipts in
2003Q2, the discovery of one case of BSE
in Alberta resulted in restrictions on beef
exports, and electrical power blackouts
caused a significant drop in production in
August. Moreover, the inventory/sales ratio
rose above trend, triggering significant destocking, especially in the automotive
sector, lowering growth by 3 percentage
points (annual rate) on average in Q2 and
Q3. Finally, the Canadian dollar appreciated
sharply against the U.S. dollar during 2003,
rising over 10 percent in real effective terms,
reflecting both the broader weakness of the
U.S. dollar as well as increases in world
commodity prices and widening CanadaU.S. interest differentials.
7.
As a result, net exports have
contracted sharply while final domestic
demand remained robust:

of consumer goods. Nonetheless, the
current account surplus has remained over 2 percent of GDP, owing to the positive
effect of higher world commodity prices on the terms of trade (Tables 2 and 3).
Household demand remained strong. Personal consumption rose by 4¼ percent in
2003Q3 from the same period in 2002, taking the personal saving rate down to an
extraordinarily low 1¼ percent. Low interest rates and pent up demand helped
spurred exceptional levels of residential investment. While most household balance

sheet indicators—including the
debt service/income ratio—remain
comfortable, the debt/income ratio
has reached around 115 percent.
Business fixed investment has
begun to recover. Purchases of
machinery and equipment began to
pick up in early 2003 and grew by
about 5¾ percent during the four
quarters ending in 2003Q3,
supported by an improvement in
corporate profits and low interest
rates (Table 4). Nonresidential
structures investment also bottomed
out at the end of 2002.

8.
The supply side of the economy
has disappointed. Since mid-2002,
productivity has been stagnant, causing
unit labor costs to accelerate even while
labor income growth has slowed. Although
labor productivity growth had accelerated
to 2 percent during 1996–2002, this was
well below the U.S. rate and the per capita
income gap remains wide.
9.
Nonetheless, financial markets
have generally strengthened in 2003.
Stock prices have risen nearly 20 percent
since late 2002, broadly in line with global
equity markets but still roughly 30 percent
below their 2000 peak. With interest rate
differentials favoring Canadian
instruments, net portfolio inflows increased
in the first half of 2003, but eased sharply
in the third quarter as the dollar’s
appreciation reduced investor appetite.

Economic slack has helped return inflation to the Bank of Canada’s 1-3 percent
target range. Staff estimates suggest that the economy was operating close to potential
around the end of 2002, but that an output gap of around 1½ percent had emerged by
2003Q3. The core CPI inflation rate had surged to just over 3 percent (12-month
rate) in late 2002/early 2003, partly reflecting the effects of large increases in

-6-

insurance premiums.1 However, core inflation
has since fallen to 1¾ percent as these special
factors dissipated and excess capacity emerged.
11.
A weaker economy and declining
inflation led the Bank of Canada to reverse
course and ease its policy stance. In early
2002, with the economy operating close to
potential and demand pressures threatening to
push inflation above the target range, the Bank
raised overnight interest rates by a cumulative
75 basis points to 2¾ percent. Although
inflation breached the target range by late
2002, the Bank held off further rate increases
as geopolitical risks weighed on the global
outlook. As these risks moderated, the Bank
tightened further in March and April 2003,
taking rates to 3¼ percent. However, with
demand slowing, the exchange rate tightening
overall monetary conditions, and inflation
falling, the Bank moved in July and September
to return overnight rates to 2¾ percent.

narrowed appreciably in the last year. Given
the weaker economic outlook, additional transfers to the provinces, and scheduled tax cuts,
the federal surplus is likely to be virtually erased in 2003/04 (Table 5).2 At the provincial
level, notwithstanding balanced budget commitments in many provinces and increased
federal transfers, a sizable deficit is projected for this year, reflecting pressures on the public
health care system as well as costs related to the SARS/BSE outbreaks. Partly driven by
balanced budget legislation, provinces have responded by delaying previously scheduled tax
cuts and announcing spending cuts.

1

Bank of Canada estimates suggest that these special factors added 1¼ percentage points to the 12-month core
inflation rate in early 2003.

2

The shift to full accrual accounting raised measured federal surpluses by $3 billion in 2002/03, leaving room
for additional spending while maintaining the commitment to balanced budgets.

-7-

III. THE SHORT-TERM OUTLOOK
13.
Staff projections are for the economy to recover, albeit at a more modest pace. GDP
growth is projected to pick up from around 1½ percent in 2003 to 2¾ percent in 2004,
initially supported by a turnaround in inventory investment. The drag from the external sector
would also wane into 2004, as a strengthening U.S. economy helps offset the lagged effect of
the appreciation of the Canadian dollar. Household consumption and residential investment
would continue to be supported by low interest rates and recent tax cuts, but slow to a more
sustainable pace and allow a modest upward adjustment to the saving rate. Business fixed
investment would benefit from low interest rates and the recovery. With the output gap
starting to close in 2004, the Bank of Canada would begin withdrawing stimulus by end-year,
keeping inflation close to 2 percent.
14.
The discussions focused on the risks to the short-term outlook. Although the Bank
of Canada’s October Monetary Policy Report had envisaged growth accelerating from
2 percent in 2003 to 3¼ percent in 2004, officials acknowledged that the risks seemed
skewed to the downside. The principal uncertainty was with regard to the impact of the
Canadian dollar’s appreciation on net exports, which both official and consensus forecasts
envisaged as being more modest than would be implied by conventional elasticities. This
more optimistic view was consistent with the fact that the appreciation partly reflected the
effect of higher world commodity prices; the apparent weakening of pass-through of
exchange rate to import prices
during the past decade; and

Choudhri, et al. (“Explaining the Exchange Rate Pass Through in Different Prices,” IMF Working Paper

Oxford Economic Forecast model suggest that a 10 percent exchange rate shock lowers GDP by 1½ percent
relative to baseline and the current account balance by 3 percent of GDP.

-8-

15.
Officials were more sanguine regarding domestic risks. The mission questioned
whether household demand could stumble, given the unusually low household saving rate,
the waning stimulus from low interest rates and recent tax cuts, the weakening of labor
market conditions, and a possible slowing of residential house prices (Box 1). Officials
responded that household balance sheets appeared sound and that housing prices, having only
just recovered from a decade-long slump, did not appear significantly out of line with
demographic trends and other fundamentals. Healthy corporate balance sheets, the lower cost
of capital imports, and considerable pent-up demand favored a strong rebound of investment,
notwithstanding the possible effects of the dollar’s appreciation and sluggish productivity on
profits and investment.
16.
Officials recognized the difficulty in gauging the degree of economic slack. The
Bank of Canada’s conventional measures placed the output gap at around ½ percent of GDP,
but capacity utilization and unemployment rates, as well as the drop in inflation, suggested a
larger degree of slack.4 Officials viewed the sharp increase in the participation rate in recent
years as reflecting structural rather than cyclical factors—especially the increase in lifetime
participation of women—but the impact on potential output and measures of the output gap
remained to be seen.
IV. MONETARY POLICY AND THE EXCHANGE RATE
17.
Bank of Canada officials and the team agreed that the inflation targeting
framework had successfully guided monetary policy and achieved low inflation, while
promoting transparency and accountability. Officials acknowledged, however, that the
uncertain macroeconomic environment had significantly complicated policymaking during
the past year. In addition to the questions surrounding standard measures of the output gap,
shocks to administered prices had blurred the signals provided by the core inflation index,
and it was also unclear how the increased credibility of the inflation-targeting framework had
affected inflation dynamics and the

Box 1. The Decline in the Canadian Personal Saving Rate1
The Canadian personal saving rate has fallen sharply in recent years, raising questions about the extent
to which household consumption can continue to support activity. The saving rate, which averaged
5 percent of disposable income in the first half of 2002, fell to around 1¼ percent in the third quarter of
2003—an historic low and significantly lower than even the U.S. saving rate.
The drop in the saving rate has to be seen against a secular decline that began in the mid-1980s. The
saving rate had reached 20 percent of GDP in 1982, but fell steadily thereafter, which Bank of Canada
estimates suggest was due to four factors:2
•
•
•
•

Lower real interest rates sharply reduced the return on household wealth;
Lower expected inflation decreased uncertainty and the need for precautionary saving;
The improvement in the fiscal position lowered the need to save for future tax liabilities;
The boom in asset prices during the 1990s increased household net wealth to well over
500 percent of disposable income, reducing the need for further asset accumulation.

Considering the large capital gains in
recent years, however, the national

be misleading. A broader measure of the

This broader measure followed the same
trend as the national accounts saving rate

remained broadly stable, while the

decline. This divergence reflects the

Nonetheless, the national accounts measure of the saving rate appears below its “equilibrium.” Staff
estimates suggest a long-run relationship exists between the saving rate and the wealth/income ratio,
expected inflation, the real interest rate, and the general government deficit/GDP ratio. These latter
variables would suggest a saving rate that is in the range of 4-5 percent, well above recent levels.
Questions remain regarding the extent to which households are adequately provisioned for retirement.
A 2001 study by Statistics Canada suggested that roughly one-third of households were not saving enough
to replace two-thirds of their pre-retirement income, even taking into account benefits from the Canada
Pension Plan. Although many of these households were at the upper end of the income distribution,
shortfalls were also significant at the low end.3 Contrasting results have been reported by the Department
of Finance, whose analysis of individual household consumption data suggest that retirees have by and
large been able to maintain pre-retirement living standards, and that current saving rates among younger
households have remained consistent with historical life-cycle patterns.

The authorities agreed that there was room for further easing of interest rates if
needed. Against the background of low inflation, significant economic slack, and a large
current account surplus, an accommodative policy stance could be maintained for a
considerable period, and would also be consistent with a desirable rebalancing of the
economy toward domestic demand. However, officials were cognizant that exchange rate
movements during 2003 had caused a significant tightening of monetary conditions and that
a further appreciation would heighten downside risks to the short-term outlook.5 Therefore,
the Bank would not hesitate to lower interest rates if signs emerged that the exchange rate
was being driven by extrapolative expectations rather than fundamentals, if external demand
appeared to weaken significantly, or if domestic investment showed signs of slackening.
19.
Subsequent to the discussion, the Bank opted to keep its target for the overnight
rate unchanged at 2¾ percent while continuing to stress the uncertainties. The December 2
policy announcement stated that while third quarter growth had been disappointing and
inflation was expected to ease further in the short run, domestic demand appeared buoyant,
partner countries seemed to be strengthening, and Canada's economic growth was likely to
rebound strongly in the fourth quarter from the effects of the August power outage and the
inventory correction. However, the Bank also underscored the continued uncertainty about
the likely impact of the appreciation of the Canadian dollar and whether existing monetary
stimulus would be sufficient to close the output gap by early 2005.
20.
The mission commended the transparency of the authorities’ inflation targeting
framework. However, the team noted that the more uncertain economic environment and
recent shift in the Bank’s policy stance suggested possible benefits in providing even greater
detail regarding the Bank’s macroeconomic forecast and its sensitivity to shocks. The
authorities responded that they had already included a quarterly inflation forecast and
additional details of other key macroeconomic aggregates in the Bank’s semi-annual
Monetary Policy Report and interim Update. In their view, a more quantitative presentation
would not be useful and could even mislead market participants regarding the precision of
the Bank’s projections.
21.
Bank of Canada officials viewed the Canadian dollar’s recent strength as broadly
consistent with underlying fundamentals. For example, versions of the Bank’s exchange
rate forecasting equation that included interest rate and inflation rate differentials, non-energy
commodity prices, and the Canada/U.S. government debt differential suggested a C$/US$
rate that was not much weaker than current levels, following an extended period of
“undervaluation.” At the same time, however, the rapidity of the appreciation suggested that
the broader weakness of the U.S. dollar, as well as Canada-specific factors, had played an
important role.
5

Note that conventional monetary conditions indices will overstate the degree of tightening from an exchange
rate appreciation to the extent that the exchange rate movement reflects a favorable supply shock—e.g., stronger
world commodity prices.

- 11 -

22.
The authorities agreed that Canada’s flexible exchange rate policy had served it
well, but expressed concern regarding spillovers from global current account imbalances.6
They stressed, in particular, that the multilateral exchange rate adjustments that would
eventually be required to correct these imbalances could be significant and place an
inordinate burden on those countries that were freely floating. Nonetheless, Canada remained
committed to allowing its currency to respond to market forces, and intervention would only
be considered if there were clear signs of a breakdown of market liquidity.
V. SUSTAINABLE FISCAL POLICY
23.
Canada’s fiscal framework has yielded considerable success. The framework—
which was adopted in the early 1990s when the federal deficit had reached nearly 8 percent
of GDP—targets balanced budgets over a rolling two-year horizon, based on conservative
fiscal assumptions and contingency reserves for unexpected macroeconomic or spending
shocks.7 This approach—which has been consistently endorsed in past Article IV reports as
an appropriate strategy for preparing for the longer-term pressures of population aging—has
delivered surpluses averaging 1-2 percent of GDP in recent years and lowered the net federal
debt-to-GDP ratio from a peak of around 70 percent in the mid-1990s to 44 percent
in 2002/03 (fiscal year begins in April).

The 2003 Budget maintained the commitment to keeping the debt-to-GDP ratio on
a permanent downward path. The budget included substantial increases in transfers in
support of provincial health care systems as well as higher outlays for low-income housing,
infrastructure, and education. Tax changes included an increase in child tax benefits, higher
contribution limits for tax-preferred saving plans, an increase in small business deductions,

a significant proportion of the longer-run movement in the C$/US$ exchange rate. The forthcoming Selected
Issues paper contains an analysis of the factors underlying longer-term term trends in the exchange rate.

and the phased elimination of the capital tax. Given the reserves built into the budget,
surpluses of ¼–½ percent of GDP were targeted in 2003/04 and 2004/05.

26.
While agreeing that the fiscal system was well placed to cope with expected
pressures from population aging compared with many other G-7 countries, the mission
stressed the importance of sustained debt reduction and health care reform. Canada’s
demographic profile is relatively favorable, especially given high immigration rates, while
recent reforms to the Canada Pension Plan—including increases in contributions rates—have
rendered this portion of the public pension system actuarially sound.8 As a result, staff
estimates suggest that federal and general government debt ratios would remain manageable
over the next 50 years provided that budget discipline is maintained (Box 2).9 Nonetheless,
demands on the public health care system are set to rise rapidly—with spending projected to
rise by nearly 7 percent of GDP by 2050—and fiscal sustainability would be jeopardized
unless significant debt reduction is achieved ahead of the retirement of the baby boom
generation and health care spending is contained.
27.
The authorities stressed their continued commitment to maintaining the debt ratio
on a downward track. They acknowledged that the smaller surpluses now expected in
coming years left this objective vulnerable to economic and other shocks. The authorities
agreed, therefore, that it would be important to rebuild the normal level of budgetary reserves
at the earliest opportunity.

8

A 1998 reform of the Canada Pension Plan increased the contribution rate to 9.9 percent and allowed
investment of surpluses in private equities and real estate.

Debt sustainability analysis using the IMF’s standard template does not reveal significant risks over the
medium term. See Appendix III of IMF Country Report No. 03/33 for details.

Box 2. Public Debt Sustainability
The impending retirement of the baby-boom generation is expected to result in significant fiscal pressures in
Canada and most other industrial countries. Although demographic trends in Canada are relatively less severe,
the old-age dependency ratio is still projected to rise to over 40 percent by 2035, roughly double its current
level. As a result, some analysts have suggested that Canada’s long-term fiscal position is extremely weak.1
Staff has analyzed Canada’s long-term fiscal position in the context of a generational accounting model.
This approach utilizes estimates of the age-distribution of federal and provincial taxes and transfer programs,
and constructs long-term projections of the fiscal position using demographic projections and assumptions
regarding productivity growth.2
These estimates suggest that the federal fiscal position is sustainable provided that budgetary policies remain
prudent. In the baseline scenario, health-care transfers to the provinces are assumed to increase sharply,
reflecting the change in the age distribution of the population and the assumption that per capita spending rises
at a rate ¼ percentage point above productivity growth (in turn reflecting continued shifts in demand and
relative prices). Nonetheless, present policies appear broadly consistent with annual federal government
surpluses averaging around ¾ percent of GDP over the next three decades, and the net federal debt-to-GDP
ratio falling to around 5 percent by 2030. Although pressures on public pension and health care systems from
population aging would result in fiscal deficits thereafter, the subsequent rise in the debt ratio would remain
manageable (see figures below).
However, the projections also illustrate the importance of sustaining fiscal discipline and containing growth
in health care spending over the coming decades. Two alternative scenarios were considered in which:
(i) permanent federal spending increases (or tax cuts) are enacted immediately that erase the surplus during the
next 10 years; and (ii) major transfers to the provinces for health care grow 2 percentage points faster than in the
baseline during 2003–2050. In these cases, while the debt ratio would continue to decline over the next
20 years, the improvement would not be sufficient to avoid a sharp increase in the debt ratio thereafter.
Similar results have been obtained for the general government—i.e., including provincial governments,
which are chiefly responsible for administering the public health care system. General government debt
remains manageable if consolidated surpluses averaged around ¾ percent of GDP through to 2025. (Note that
the calculations do not include the Canada Pension Plan, and its Quebec counterpart, since recent reforms to
these programs have left these on a sustainable basis.) However, if outlays on health care were to continue to
grow at the rates projected in the 2003 budget, or if other outlays were ratcheted up (or taxes cut) in a manner
that eliminated the budget surplus over the next 10 years, fiscal sustainability would be jeopardized.

28.
For this reason, the authorities indicated that a priority would be placed on
expenditure reform. They acknowledged that direct program spending had grown rapidly
last year, but noted that this partly reflected one-off measures, including the effects of
shifting to accrual accounting, and that these outlays remained low at 5½ percent of GDP.
Nonetheless, a major review of existing programs—similar to that in the early 1990s—was
planned to enable a reallocation of resources to high priority areas, such as education,
innovation, and infrastructure.10
29.
The authorities agreed that there was little immediate scope for significant further
reductions in tax rates. On the corporate tax side, recent rate reductions and the phased
elimination of the federal capital tax meant that the system remained competitive with that in
the United States, but officials suggested that consideration was being given to increasing
depreciation allowances to align them more closely with the useful economic lives of capital
assets. Officials acknowledged that Canadian marginal personal tax rates remained high at
both lower and upper income levels, especially against the background of recent U.S. rate
reductions (Box 3). However, there was not enough budget room presently to lower rates.
Instead the focus was on more modest initiatives, such as expanding the range of taxpreferred saving vehicles.
30.
The mission welcomed signs that consideration was being given to complementing
the existing fiscal framework with a longer-run debt objective. The new Prime Minister
had, in September, called for eventually taking the government debt/GDP ratio down to
around 25 percent, a goal that seemed attainable within a decade under current policies and
could provide a useful anchor for annual budget decisions. The team suggested that a debt
objective could be operationalized by targeting a specific fiscal balance over the cycle,
enabling a more transparent and flexible response to cyclical and other shocks. Officials
responded how the debt objective would be applied in practice remained to be determined,
but stressed the importance of maintaining the existing two-year budget framework. The
present system had proven its ability to respond flexibly to changing circumstances while
delivering surpluses and sustaining social consensus for debt reduction.
31.
Officials noted that fiscal surpluses posed challenges for debt management,
especially with regard to maintaining adequate liquidity for longer-dated securities. For
example, the government’s real return bonds (RRBs) had yielded savings in recent years as
inflation had fallen, but the RRB’s role and cost effectiveness in an environment of a
declining debt stock was unclear.11 This concern was exacerbated by ongoing efforts to
reduce the fixed-rate percentage of the debt stock, which stochastic simulations suggested
would lower debt servicing costs.

10

This review, as well as an immediate freeze on major capital projects and the size of the civil service, was
announced in December.

Box 3. Labor and Capital Taxes in Canada
With the emergence of fiscal surpluses, significant tax reduction has taken place in Canada. The federal
government launched a five-year tax reduction plan in 2000, which significantly lowered statutory tax rates on
personal and corporate income, and steps have also been taken to increase contribution limits for tax-deferred
retirement savings plans and to cut capital taxes. Some provinces, too, have lowered marginal income tax rates
for both households and businesses.
Nonetheless, the average effective tax rate on
labor in Canada remains high, especially
compared to the United States.1 The Canada-U.S.
gap stems mainly from the higher marginal rates
that apply to personal income―Canadian rates are
estimated to be 6-10 percentage points higher—
which more than offsets the lower rate paid for
social security. Indeed, taking into account the
higher tax rate on consumption, the total tax wedge
on labor in Canada is closer to the European
average than to the United States.2 Moreover,
Canada’s relatively progressive personal income
tax system interacts with high clawback rates on
transfers and tax credits, causing high marginal tax
rates on low and middle income families. For
example, at certain levels of income, a singleearner with two children in Ontario faces a
combined federal and provincial effective marginal
tax rate slightly above 60 percent, mainly as a
result of the clawback rate on child tax benefits

32.
The mission questioned whether the February 2003 federal-provincial Health
Accord would be sufficient to ensure the sustainability of the public health-care system.
The Accord substantially increased federal transfers to the provinces (by an average of
½ percent of GDP annually) in exchange for commitments by the provinces to expand
coverage on primary care, home care, and prescription drugs, and to strengthen
accountability of provincial plans. However, the mission noted the already high level of
spending on health care and wondered whether other reforms—such as increasing the role of
the private sector in the provision of services or introducing price-based incentives, including
co-payments and deductibles—were needed to increase efficiency and contain demand.12
33.
Federal officials viewed the Accord as a significant step toward reforming the
system. They stressed that shifting the emphasis from delivering services from hospitals to
primary- and home-based care, enhancing access to pharmaceuticals, and establishing
mechanisms for gauging the quality of health care delivery by the provinces would
significantly improve the system’s efficiency. Indeed, the constitutional responsibility for the
administration of the system lay with the provinces, and there were no prohibitions on
provinces engaging with the private sector to deliver services. Nonetheless, officials noted
that the Canada Health Act prohibited deductibles and co-payments for “medicallynecessary” services, consistent with the social consensus in Canada for equal access to such
services. In their view, price-based incentives would not significantly affect demand, and
greater savings would be reaped from reallocating resources as envisaged in the Accord.
34.
The mission suggested that the ongoing review of equalization payments to the
provinces provided an opportunity to reduce the system’s complexity and avoid undue
volatility of annual transfers. Officials responded that amendments to the system—that
compensate lower-income provinces for their weaker tax bases—were being negotiated with
the provinces and, hopefully, would include changes that would lead to a smoother flow of
disbursements.
35.
The team welcomed the application of full accrual accounting to the federal
budget. The officials agreed that this step enhanced the transparency of the fiscal accounts,
and that reporting the amortization of physical assets as an annual expenditure would
encourage a more careful management of these assets, as well as more judicious decisions on
new investments. Similarly, the more complete and timely recording will encourage a riskbased approach to managing the government’s financial liabilities.

VI. FINANCIAL SECTOR POLICIES IN SUPPORT OF GLOBALIZED CAPITAL MARKETS
36.
The authorities noted that balance sheets in the Canadian corporate and financial
sectors had fared well during the recent downturn. Although the financial position of some
industries—e.g., steel, automotive, and airlines—was still relatively fragile, the overall
position of businesses was healthy, with

The mission welcomed recent
efforts to strengthen corporate governance and accounting standards. New rules governing
financial reporting and disclosure would be issued in early 2004, a Canadian Public
Accountability Board had been established to review the operations of accounting firms, and
the provinces—which are responsible for securities regulation in their jurisdictions—had
stiffened penalties for fraud. Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) officials explained that
the OSC had begun to take on a greater role, relative to the Toronto Stock Exchange, in
defining and enforcing compliance, reflecting the OSC’s advantage in applying legal
sanctions and its coverage of unlisted firms.
38.
The team suggested that there was scope for further consolidating securities
regulation, which presently appeared fragmented along provincial lines. The absence of a
single national regulator seemed to result in an additional administrative burden and created
room for regulatory arbitrage, while the need to achieve consensus among provincial
regulators could make more difficult the response to new challenges. Many of these issues
did not seem to be wholly addressed by the provinces’ proposal to adopt a “passport system.”
The federal authorities generally agreed, but noted that the provinces were highly averse to
giving up their responsibilities in this area.13
39.
The mission observed that the criteria for approving bank mergers still seemed
unclear. Legislation in 2001 had established a process for reviewing the potential impact of
merger proposals on competition and the safety and soundness of the system, but proposals
were still subject to ministerial review against an undefined public interest criterion. Officials
responded that concerns on this front had led the authorities to publish a set of

for the creation of a single regulator built on a joint federal-provincial model.

- 18 -

specific public interest criteria for large bank mergers in June 2003. Further, a revised set of
merger review guidelines are expected to be finalized by June 2004. However, given that that
the banking system was already highly concentrated, it would be important to gauge whether
potential economies of scale resulting from mergers outweighed any impairment of access to
financial services by both depositors and small- and medium-sized borrowers.
40.
Sign of weakness have emerged among many defined benefits (DB) corporate
pension plans. As of end-2002, close to half of almost 400 DB plans supervised by the
Office of the Superintendent for Financial Institutions (OSFI) reported solvency ratios below
one and the number of pension plans on OSFI’s watch list had grown significantly. With
similar problems among provincially-supervised pension plans, the mission wondered
whether the lack of a single national supervisor and pension guarantee fund was a concern.
41.
The authorities responded that problems among DB plans did not represent a
systemic risk. Nevertheless, supervision by the federal authorities had been stiffened, with
increased stress testing on pension plans and the scope for contribution holidays having been
reduced. Moreover, solvency margins would also likely benefit from the recent strengthening
of stock markets. The officials did not favor consolidating provincial and federal supervision,
since such steps would not materially improve the safety or soundness of the system. They
also cautioned that the establishment of a national guarantee fund could raise costs to
employers and discourage them from providing pension plans for employees.
VII. POLICIES TO SUPPORT PRODUCTIVITY AND INCOME GROWTH
42.
Officials agreed that boosting long-term productivity growth—a long-standing
topic of past discussions—was a key policy challenge. Although labor productivity growth
accelerated during the latter half of the 1990s, its rate was still about ½ percentage point
lower than in the United States, and has

reducing the relative price of imports of machinery and equipment, but officials agreed with
the team that addressing policy impediments to growth remained a key policy priority.
Labor and regulatory policies
43.
The team asked whether the Canada/U.S. productivity gap and slower pace of IT
investment reflected barriers to foreign direct investment (FDI) or lower levels of research
and development (R&D). Officials agreed that the low level of R&D was a concern, but
noted that this seemed to reflect mainly the smaller size of Canadian companies rather than
policy impediments.15 They did not view the more generous tax treatment accorded to small
businesses, or limits on FDI in sectors such as telecommunication, banking, and
transportation, as significant impediments to R&D or growth.
44.
The mission suggested that the interaction between tax and social programs could
weigh on labor utilization and efficiency. For example, means-tested federal tax credits and
provincial social assistance programs reduced incentives for labor market participation
among lower-skilled workers, while the structure of benefits for the Canada Pension Plan
(CPP) system encouraged early retirement. The team noted that gradually raising the normal
retirement age from 65 presently, in line with projected increases in longevity, could provide
a basis for lowering the premium rate. Officials responded that while the incentives for early
retirement were a concern—and consideration was being given to recasting the benefit
structure for the Canada Pension Plan—they did not view them as having a significant impact
on labor supply. They also noted that at the time of the 1998 reform there had been no social
consensus for raising the retirement age in order to lower contribution rates.
45.
The team suggested that the ongoing review of Employment Insurance (EI)
premiums provided scope for meaningful reforms. In this regard, the mission reiterated the
staff’s longstanding concern that the EI system discouraged labor mobility and exacerbated
regional disparities. The lack of experience-rated premiums and the use of the system’s
payroll tax to fund broader social policy objectives—such as parental leave benefits—caused
substantial deadweight losses.16 Officials noted that the focus of the current review was
simply to establish a mechanism for ensuring that EI rates remained relatively stable over the
cycle at a level that was sufficient to fund the system, and broader reforms were not being
contemplated.

Empirical analyses have not identified large differences in regulatory burdens between Canada and the
United States. See, for example, C. Gust and J. Marquez, “International Comparisons of Productivity Growth:
The Role of Information Technology and Regulatory Practices,” Federal Reserve Board Discussion Paper
No. 727 (2002).

- 20 -

46.
The team questioned whether restrictions on inter-provincial trade and other
regulatory policies were a concern. Officials responded that the 1994 Agreement on Internal
Trade (AIT) had addressed most constraints, but there remained a number of areas where
further progress seemed warranted. For example, the AIT’s dispute settlement system needed
to be developed further, and restrictions on government procurement, labor certification, and
the movement of energy across provincial lines remained irritants. Officials noted that
provincial efforts to deregulate electricity systems had faced significant problems, with
Ontario having to re-regulate consumer prices at a substantial fiscal cost. This experience
pointed to the difficulty of designing incentives to ensure a reliable distribution system and
adequate generation capacity, especially in the presence of low marginal cost hydro and
nuclear power plants.
Trade, environmental, and other policy issues
47.
While acknowledging the openness of Canada’s trade regime, the mission
encouraged further liberalization. In the agricultural sector, for example, while farm support
amounted to only ¾ percent of GDP (half the OECD average), it still represents around
17 percent of gross farm receipts. Moreover, out-of-quota tariffs are high and Canada’s dairy
export practices have been challenged at the WTO.17
48.
The authorities suggested that a multilateral approach was needed for significant
progress in these areas. Although the recent Cancún ministerial meeting had been a
significant disappointment, the Doha Round remained the best forum for addressing
agricultural issues, expanding market access, and strengthening the rules governing antidumping and countervailing measures. The authorities saw little scope for a unilateral
dismantling of Canada’s supply-management system.
49.
The authorities saw the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) as
another cornerstone of their trade policy framework (Box 4). They acknowledged that some
observers had called for a further deepening of economic linkages with the United States,
possibly involving a customs union or a common market. Although these more ambitious
proposals seemed premature, efforts were continuing to lower the cost of cross-border
transactions, which was especially challenging given heightened concern regarding border
security. The NAFTA partners had recently agreed to extending cooperation on several
fronts, including with regard to rules governing investment, studying possible harmonization
of MFN tariffs and rules of origin, and steel policy issues.

17

In 2003, least developed countries were provided tariff and duty free access for all goods, except over-quota
supply-managed agricultural commodities.

- 21 Box 4. Canada-U.S. Trade Integration1
Canada and the Unites States have taken important steps to promote economic linkages during the past four decades.
The 1965 Canada-U.S. auto pact freed cross-border trade in the sector and led to a significant growth in the Canadian
auto industry. In 1989, the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement (CUSFTA) expanded the coverage of tariff-free trade to
almost all sectors, and in 1994 the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) broadened the scope of the
CUSFTA by including Mexico. The CUSFTA and NAFTA were groundbreaking insofar as they covered a broad range
of sectors, including services and investment, and introduced a unique dispute settlement mechanism.
The CUSFTA and NAFTA have yielded substantial increases
in trade and financial flows between the two countries.
Canada’s exports to the United States grew at an annual
average rate of roughly 8 percent while the share of Canadian
exports to the U.S. rose more than 12 percentage points
between 1989 and 2002 (panel a). Gross FDI flows between
the two countries rose more than fivefold during this period.
Increased trade and financial linkages led to significant
changes in the dynamics of business cycles and growth in
Canada. Canada-U.S. business cycles became more
synchronized and the rapid growth of intra-industry trade also
contributed to greater cross-country correlations of investment
and imports (panel b). Moreover, exports to the United States
played a much larger role in driving Canadian growth after the
advent of CUSFTA (panel c).
Some observers have called for deeper integration with the
United States in order to eliminate remaining barriers to
trade.2 Barriers remain notwithstanding NAFTA. One study
suggests, for example, that the costs to NAFTA countries of
the rules of origin system are as much as 2–3 percent of
NAFTA GDP. The most ambitious proposals include calls for
a “grand bargain,” which would couple security and defenserelated policies with deeper trade integration, possibly in the
context of a customs union or common market. Some of these
proposals have even included calls for a monetary union. More
modest proposals have suggested greater efforts toward
harmonizing rules, standards, and regulations, in order to
reduce the extent to which these arrangements impede trade
and efficiency.
What is the next step for further integration? Recognizing the
importance of secure and continuous access to each other’s
markets, Canada and the United States have placed an
immediate emphasis on border security. For example, a Smart
Border Action Plan has been implemented, which includes a
Free and Secure Trade (FAST) program to harmonize
procedures for clearing cross-border shipments. NAFTA
partners have also recently decided to establish study groups to
analyze avenues for harmonization of MFN tariffs and rules of
origin requirements, and to improve rules governing
investment flows. Looking further ahead, however, steps
toward further integration would also need to grapple with
more difficult issues, including the perennial problems
regarding agricultural and natural resource policies, and different
approaches to labor and environment policies.

50.
The authorities expressed concern about the ongoing negotiations for a Free Trade
Area of the Americas (FTAA). They questioned, in particular, whether proposals by some
participants at the November 2003 ministerial to shift the negotiations away from a broadbased regional agreement to one that was more narrowly focused could encourage countries
to place a greater emphasis on bilateral agreements. Although Canada was active on the
bilateral front too, officials noted that Canada could be at a disadvantage relative to the
United States in using such agreements to gain market access, including in the area of
financial services.18
51.
Progress has been made toward implementing Canada’s commitments under the
Kyoto Protocol. Work has begun on a tradable permit system for green house gas (GHG)
emissions, and various fiscal incentives in support of new technologies and conservation
have been introduced. The team observed, however, that measures thus far did not seem
sufficient to achieve the targeted 29 percent reduction in GHG emissions by 2010, and that it
would be difficult to achieve this objective without significant fiscal costs or a larger output
loss than the 0.4 percent drop in GDP relative to baseline in 2010 estimated by the
authorities. The mission suggested, therefore, that other, possibly more efficient,
instruments—such as energy-related consumption taxes—should be considered. The officials
noted that such alternatives had been ruled out by the previous administration partly because
of concern that their burden would fall too heavily on certain regions. However, they viewed
the economic risks as manageable, especially since the U.S. decision not to ratify the
Protocol would reduce pressure on the price of emissions permits in international markets
and that the approach builds in contingences to ensure that Canada remains competitive and
can take advantage of future technologies and technological opportunities.
52.
The authorities have taken welcome steps to boost official development assistance
(ODA). Canada’s ODA rose to 0.28 percent of GNP in 2002, and the authorities are
committed to doubling spending in dollar terms by the end of the decade. Concomitantly,
spending was also being targeted at countries and projects where its effectiveness was most
likely to be maximized.
53.
The mission acknowledged the high quality of Canadian statistical systems, but
noted that user charges could constrain analysis.19 Officials responded that the fees charged
by Statistics Canada (including to other government agencies) were consistent with broader
government policy, which required cost recovery by all government departments. However,
the officials noted that these fees were waived for educational institutions.

18

The outcome of the ministerial meeting was a renewed commitment to conclude the FTAA by January 2005,
but differences on sensitive issues such as agriculture and investment would allow “different levels of
commitments” between countries. Canada has free trade agreements with Israel, Costa Rica, and Chile and is
working toward agreements with the Central American Four (El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and
Nicaragua), and Singapore, and has held preliminary discussions with the Dominican Republic, CARICOM,
and Andean Pact countries.

VIII. STAFF APPRAISAL
54.
The authorities’ strong monetary and fiscal policy framework, as well as the
structural reforms introduced since the early 1990s, have enabled the Canadian economy
to respond flexibly to recent shocks and laid a solid foundation for recovery. Downside
risks remain a concern, especially given the possibility that the dollar’s strength will weigh
more heavily on net exports and domestic profitability. However, near-term prospects appear
broadly favorable, with growth likely to rebound next year underpinned by household
spending and a pick up in business investment.
55.
Macroeconomic policies should remain supportive, with fiscal policy continuing to
focus on sustained debt reduction and structural reforms geared toward boosting
productivity.
•

The principal responsibility for fostering a cyclical recovery remains with the
monetary authorities, especially given the limited room for fiscal maneuver under the
existing medium-term budgetary framework.

•

With the erosion of budget surpluses, federal and provincial fiscal authorities need to
remain focused on sustaining debt reduction and ensuring that retirement and health
care systems are prepared for impending demographic pressures.

•

Productivity gains will be essential for Canada to remain competitive and to generate
the income and saving necessary to cope with population aging. Therefore, an
emphasis is needed on financial sector, labor, trade, and other structural policy
reforms to help strengthen Canada’s longer-term growth potential and allow the
economy to take full advantage of the increased integration of global markets.

56.
With the recent opening of an output gap, the appreciation of the dollar weighing
on activity, and core inflation expected to remain low, monetary policy can remain
accommodative for some time. To be sure, the signals offered by inflation data have been
clouded by special factors during the recent year, and considerable uncertainty attaches to
estimates of the output gap. However, given the credibility won by the Bank over the past
decade, and with some indicators suggesting that economic slack may be larger than
conventional estimates, there is room to respond if the risks to the recovery intensify and
further support to domestic demand is needed.
57.
Canada’s commitment to exchange rate flexibility has been helpful in facilitating
the adjustment of global macroeconomic imbalances. Although the speed of appreciation of
the Canadian dollar has raised concern, its strength has partly reflected the broader weakness
of the U.S. dollar and does not appear to be out of line with underlying fundamentals,
especially considering Canada’s current account surplus and improved net foreign liability
position, and world commodity price developments.
58.
The authorities’ fiscal framework has left Canada relatively well-positioned to cope
with the impending fiscal pressures stemming from population aging, but the short-term
fiscal outlook has become more challenging. With pressures on pension and health care

- 24 -

systems likely to grow in coming decades, sustained surpluses and debt reduction will be
essential in order to ensure fiscal sustainability. However, the economic slowdown and the
spending initiatives introduced with the 2003 Budget, particularly on health-care related
transfers to the provinces, have used up much of the planning surpluses that were projected
last year. Therefore, it will be important to ensure that the forthcoming budget demonstrates a
firm commitment to achieving the planned contingency reserve set out in the recent Fiscal
Update and to rebuilding the economic prudence factor at the earliest opportunity.
59.
Difficult issues at both the federal and provincial levels still need to be tackled to
keep the public debt ratio on a downward track. The recent federal-provincial Health
Accord has been helpful in providing greater certainty regarding the funding for provincial
health and social programs, but there would seem to be scope for strengthening incentives to
contain costs and usage, including by expanding the role of private providers and introducing
some degree of cost recovery from patients. It will be important to ensure that amendments to
the system of federal-provincial equalization payments reduce its complexity, avoid
excessive year-to-year swings in payments, and contain the burden on the federal budget.
60.
The present environment suggests a policy focus on expenditure control rather
than broad-based tax cuts. Especially given the recent growth of departmental outlays, the
authorities’ emphasis on a comprehensive review of existing programs is welcome. Although
tax rates still remain high in Canada, the more difficult budgetary situation means that any
new measures in the near term would need to be relatively modest and accompanied by an
offsetting broadening of the tax base or expenditure cuts.
61.
The public pension system and other age-related programs appear sound but
further reforms may still be warranted. For example, improving the actuarial fairness of the
adjustment to CPP benefits for those who retire before or after the statutory retirement age, or
gradual increases in the retirement age to take into account increases in longevity, could help
encourage labor market attachment and possibly enable an eventual reduction in the CPP
premium rate. Increases in the retirement age could also help reduce the burden on the oldage security system, while encouraging greater accumulation of private retirement savings.
62.
The government’s fiscal framework could usefully be complemented by a clearer
longer-term anchor. For example, a more explicit longer-term debt objective could provide a
more transparent basis for weighing the longer-term implications of policy options, or
provide a basis for supplementing the existing two-year planning framework with a
commitment to achieving a specific fiscal surplus over the economic cycle.
63.
The Canadian financial system has remained resilient. This has reflected both the
underlying strength of financial regulation and an effective response to increased global
concerns regarding corporate accounting and governance standards. At the same time,
however, in order to ensure that the financial system remains well placed to compete
effectively in the face of the increasing integration of global capital markets, transparent
guidelines will be needed to allow bank mergers to go forward in the absence of compelling
public-interest concern. Harmonization of securities market regulation and legislation—and

- 25 -

the eventual creation of a single regulator—would also support the financial sector’s ability
to remain globally competitive. In addition, recent weaknesses among defined-benefit
pension plans has highlighted the importance of strengthening disclosure requirements and
rules governing contribution holidays, and further harmonizing federal-provincial regulation
and supervision.
64.
Ensuring that regulatory and other policies support productivity growth remains a
key long-term challenge. In addition to ensuring that the tax and retirement systems provide
appropriate incentives to save and invest, and that the financial system is well placed to
intermediate capital both domestically and internationally, key priorities include:
•

Regulatory policies: Deregulation in the electricity sector has proven more difficult
and costly than expected, and it will be important to ensure that consumers are not
inappropriately shielded from underlying costs. Similarly, achievement of the
authorities’ environmental objectives may require consideration of instruments such
as consumption-related taxes to help minimize adverse fiscal and supply-side
consequences. In addition, continued efforts are needed to remove interprovincial
barriers to trade.

•

Social policies: The use of the EI system to fund broader social policy objectives—
including extended benefits in high unemployment regions—has resulted in
significant cross-subsidization across industries and regions. The pending review of
the system provides a useful opportunity to consider introducing experience-rated
premiums and alternative funding options for the social objectives presently being
supported by the system.

•

Trade and agricultural policies: Canada’s trade system remains open and
transparent. However, easing import barriers further—especially in the area of
agriculture—and exerting further discipline over the use of anti-dumping and
countervailing duties would encourage greater competitive efficiencies and
complement Canada’s official development objectives. Canada can also play an
important leadership role in efforts to bridge differences among the participants of the
Doha Round.

65.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place within the standard
12-month cycle.

Canada - Financial System Stability Assessment Volume II: Report on Observance of Standards
in the Financial System

FO/Dis/00/2, Sup. 1,
04/01/00

Summary: The FSSA report concluded that Canada has a stable and highly advanced
financial system, which is among the soundest in the world. Moreover, it is supported
by a well-developed regulatory system that shows a high degree of compliance with
major international standards. Nevertheless, the FSSA report made a few
recommendations to further strengthening the regulatory framework and financial
system’s resilience, most of which have already been addressed, including:
•

Introducing capital requirements for the guarantees in life insurance segregated
fund (completed by end-2001);

•

Tabling legislation granting OSFI powers to remove a financial institution’s
director or senior officer if the person is deemed not suitable to hold that office
based on a number of criteria. The latter legislation brought Canada into full
compliance with the Basel Core Principles;

•

Making significant progress in harmonizing securities regulation and improving
coordination among provincial securities regulators, including through the
Canadian Securities Administrators. Although there remain multiple regulators at
the provincial level, a Senate commission was created to develop specific
recommendations on further harmonization and streamlining of securities
regulation.

Canada: Report on the Observance of Standards
and Codes—Fiscal Transparency Module

IMF Country Report
No. 02/51, 03/12/02

Summary: The report found that fiscal management in Canada meets the
requirements of the fiscal transparency code, and in a number of instances represents
best practice. In particular, it highlighted the use of private sector economic forecasts,
prudence factors, and a contingency reserve for fiscal forecasting in Canada. Fiscal
management was also commended for its statistical integrity, impartial tax
administration, open procurement, and a transparent regulatory process.
The report found several areas where further improvements would be desirable,
including: (i) the preparation of timely, current year estimates of federal and
provincial budgets on a comparable basis, (ii) a comprehensive account of the
procedures for the budget cycle and expenditure management system, (iii) systematic
reporting of the use of reserves for non-economic contingencies, (iv) resume
publication of reconciled national and public accounts forecasts of major aggregates
over the forecast horizon, and (v) publication by all governments of quasi-fiscal
activities.

- 33 -

APPENDIX I

Many of these issues have been addressed, including: (i) the release by Statistics
Canada of consolidated data for federal and provincial budgets for 2001-02 (on a
Financial Management System basis), and (ii) the publication of comprehensive
descriptions of budget and expenditure management procedures, including: a joint
document entitled “Budgeting in Canada” by the Government and the OECD;
detailed accounts of policies and procedures on expenditure management at the
website of the Treasury Board Secretariat; and the explanation of the budget cycle
and process in Budget and Update documents.
IMF Country Report
Canada: Report on the Observance of Standards
No. 03/328, 10/23/03
and Codes—Data Module
Summary: Canada’s macroeconomic statistics are comprehensive, timely, and
accurate and thus adequate to conduct effective surveillance of economic and
financial policies. Official institutions responsible for the compilation and
dissemination of the macroeconomic datasets are supported by adequate legal and
institutional frameworks. These frameworks protect confidentiality and ensure that
statistical work is conducted within a quality assurance program and with sufficient
resources. Integrity is ensured by the professionalism of the staff, transparency in
statistical policies and practices, and the provision of ethical guidelines for staff.
Compilers generally follow internationally accepted guidelines in the production of
the macroeconomic statistics, which is well-supported by excellent efforts to develop
source data that facilitate a high degree of accuracy and reliability. Statistics are
generally relevant, well documented, available with good frequency on a timely basis,
and readily accessible to users, who trust them as objective.
While recognizing the high quality of the macroeconomic data, the report makes
recommendations to further strengthen the statistical system, most of which are
already being addressed, including these priorities:
•

Articulate the roles of Statistics Canada and the Bank of Canada in producing
financial sector statistics and explore possibilities for more data sharing of
monetary and financial statistics;

•

Estimate consumption of fixed capital at replacement cost rather than historic
costs now used for the corporate sector in the Canadian System of National
Accounts (CSNA);

•

Disseminate information on the sources and methods used in compiling quarterly
public sector statistics for the quarterly CSNA; and

•

Reclassify certain transactions that are not recorded in line with the 5th edition of
the Balance of Payments Manual (BPM5).

APPENDIX II

Canada—Statistical Issues
The quality, coverage, periodicity, and timeliness of Canada’s economic data are considered
to be excellent both in the context of the Article IV consultation and for purposes of ongoing
surveillance. Canada has subscribed to the Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard
(SDDS), and its metadata are posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standard Bulletin Board
(DSBB).
Real Sector. Statistical Authorities of Canada (Statistics Canada) provide timely and
adequate data in monthly, quarterly, and annual frequency thereby facilitating the analysis of
economic developments and assessment of policy proposals within a quantitative
macroeconomic framework. In May 2001, Statistics Canada effected a smooth transition
from Laspeyres methodology for estimating real expenditure-based GDP to Fisher index
formulae, which enabled more accurate comparison between Canada and other G-7
countries.
Fiscal Sector. The Department of Finance of Canada (Finance Canada) provides monthly
and annual data on the federal government’s budget, tax policies, rules and regulations for
Canada’s banks and other financial institutions. The provided data enable adequate
assessment of the impact of fiscal policy measures on Canada’s economic performance.
Monetary Sector. The Bank of Canada provides timely and adequate coverage of daily,
weekly, monthly and quarterly data related to the monetary sector.
External Sector. Statistics Canada provides timely information of on monthly, quarterly, and
annual frequency of Balance of Payments and international position. Detailed coverage of
data as well as frequency thereof is reported in the appendix Core Statistical Indicators.
Finance Canada provides monthly data on Official International Reserves in a format
comparable to the IMF’s reserve data template, thus enabling adequate surveillance. Data are
published at http://www.fin.gc.ca/finsearch/finresults_e.asp?Who=News.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on Canada
February 18, 2004
1.
This note reports on recent macroeconomic and policy developments since the staff
report was issued. These developments do not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
Recent economic and financial market developments
2.
Recent indicators point to a slower-than-expected pick up in activity in the fourth
quarter of 2003. GDP was essentially flat in November, following only 0.1 percent growth in
October. The November trade surplus also fell, owing to continued declines in exports of
autos and capital goods, while imports grew strongly.
3.
Nonetheless, household and labor market indicators remain generally favorable.
Although retail sales fell ½ percent in November, sales excluding autos rose by 3/4 percent,
and housing activity remained strong with the construction sector posting robust gains.
Employment has continued to rise in recent months, accumulating gains of 50,000 new jobs
in both December 2003 and January 2004. The majority of job gains were in full-time work,
with private sector employment accounting for most of the increase. The unemployment rate
edged down to 7.4 percent, as the labor force participation rate reached new record highs in
December.
4.
Inflation remains subdued. The headline CPI edged up 0.1 percent in December, and
the Bank of Canada’s core measure was up 0.2 percent. However, the base effects of
December 2002 electricity price rebates in Ontario caused the year-over-year headline and
core inflation rates to rise to 2.0 percent and 2.2 percent, respectively.
Monetary policy
5.
On January 20, the Bank of Canada lowered its target for the overnight rate by
25 basis points to 2½ percent. In the accompanying Monetary Policy Report update, the
Bank noted that the strength of the Canadian dollar and signs of larger-than-earlier
anticipated economic slack meant that additional monetary stimulus was required to support
demand and return inflation to its target. In the update, the Bank scaled back its growth
projection to 2¾ percent in 2004 and 3¾ percent in 2005, with the output gap expected to
close only by the third quarter of 2005, and core inflation to fall below 1½ percent in early
2004, before returning to the 2 percent target by end 2005.
6.
Financial markets appear to be pricing in a further cut in the overnight rate.
Three-month treasury bill yields have remained about 25 bps below the Bank of Canada’s
overnight rate since the January 20 interest rate announcement in the context of the broader
strengthening of the U.S. dollar in recent weeks—the Canadian dollar has fallen by about
4 percent against the U.S. dollar since mid-January.

-2-

Fiscal and other policy developments
7.
The January Throne speech outlined the principal policy priorities of Prime
Minister Paul Martin’s government, which included the following commitments:
•

To assist local governments in funding infrastructure investment, with the
government providing municipalities a rebate of their payments of Goods and
Services Tax, at a cost to the federal government roughly of ½ percent of GDP
annually.

•

To preserve the sustainability of the health care system and work with the provinces
on “the necessary reforms and long term sustainability of the health care system.”

•

To achieve the Kyoto Accord goals for greenhouse-gas emissions and increase
funding for other environmental initiatives, including a ten-year, $3.5-billion plan to
clean up contaminated sites (which has already been included in earlier budget
projections.)

•

To promote job training and higher education, including by calling for an overhaul of
the Canada Student Loans program, creating new grants for postsecondary education,
and expanding the benefits of education savings plans, especially for lower-income
families.

8.
In the period leading up to the 2005 Budget, the government has re-affirmed its
commitment to preserving fiscal surpluses. In late December 2003, the new Finance
Minister announced a freeze on large capital projects and limits on public sector employee
pay rises, and introduced a Cabinet-led review of government program spending. In recent
speeches, the Minister cautioned that the fiscal position will be under pressure both because
of the impact of the economic situation on revenues and the need to fund new priorities, but
he has stressed the government’s continued commitment to fiscal surpluses and debt
reduction.

March 10, 2004

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Concludes 2004 Article IV Consultation with Canada
On February 18, 2004, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Canada.1
Background
Canada successfully weathered the earlier global downturn, growing substantially faster than
other G7 countries, but the economy softened beginning in late 2002 and growth slowed to only
1 percent during the four quarters to 2003Q3. Industrial production has been especially
sluggish, with manufacturing output in November 2003 below its level a year ago. Low
productivity growth, in part related to the cyclical downturn, caused unit labor costs to accelerate
even in the face of modest wage increases.
Several adverse factors contributed to the slowdown: the SARS outbreak dampened domestic
demand and tourism receipts in the second quarter, the discovery of one case of BSE in Alberta
resulted in restrictions on beef exports, and electrical power blackouts caused a significant drop
in production in August. Moreover, as the inventory/sales ratio rose above trend, significant destocking was triggered in 2003, especially in the automotive sector, which subtracted about
3 percentage points on average from annual growth in the second and third quarters.
In addition, the sharp and rapid appreciation of the Canadian dollar also weighed on demand.
From late 2002 to end 2003, the domestic currency appreciated by over 20 percent against the
U.S. dollar, and by close to 15 percent in real effective terms. This helped cause net exports to
contract sharply, subtracting about 2½ percentage points from annual GDP growth during the
four quarters to 2003Q3.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

-2Nonetheless, domestic demand was supported by low interest rates and remained robust over
2003. Personal consumption rose by 4¼ percent in 2003Q3 from the same period in 2002,
underpinned by a resilient labor market. Job creation was robust, especially in the service
sector, and the unemployment rate edged down to 7.4 percent by end-2003, despite record high
levels of labor participation. While strong consumption took the personal saving rate down to an
unusual low of 1¼ percent, most household balance sheet indicators remain comfortable.
Low interest rates and pent-up demand also helped spur high levels of residential investment. In
addition, following two years of decline, business fixed investment began to recover and
purchases of machinery and equipment rose by over 5½ percent in real terms during the four
quarters ending in 2003Q3, in response to the strength of corporate profits, low interest rates,
and rising equity prices.
The opening of an output gap helped return inflation to the Bank of Canada’s 1–3 percent target
range. Staff estimates suggest that the economy moved from a position close to potential
around the end of 2002 to roughly 1½ percent below potential by 2003Q3. The core CPI
inflation rate had surged to just over 3 percent (12-month rate) in late 2002/early 2003, partly
reflecting special factors including a spike in insurance premiums. However, as these special
factors dissipated and excess capacity emerged, core inflation fell rapidly to 1½ percent in
August, before edging up toward 2¼ percent by end 2003.
The weaker economy and lower inflation have led to a shift in the stance of monetary policy.
During 2002, the Bank of Canada had begun withdrawing stimulus, reflecting concern that
capacity constraints and demand pressures would push inflation above the target range.
While geopolitical risks helped persuade the Bank to hold off from further interest rate hikes
during late 2002 and early 2003, as these risks moderated, the Bank tightened further in March
and April 2003, taking overnight rates to 3¼ percent. More recently, however, the Bank has
responded to the slowdown in demand, the sharp appreciation of the exchange rate, and the
drop in inflation, easing in July and September 2003, and then again in January 2004, to return
overnight rates to 2½ percent.
The room for fiscal maneuver has narrowed over the last year. At the federal level, after
achieving a federal surplus of C$7 billion (½ percent of GDP) in 2002/03, the economic
slowdown and last year’s budget initiatives—including a commitment to transfer additional funds
to the provinces and territories for health care—appear likely to cause the surplus to decline
appreciably in 2003/04. Nonetheless, the public debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to fall further and
the federal authorities have indicated their continued commitment to rebuilding normal
budgetary reserves and maintaining the debt ratio on a steady downward track. In support of
this long-standing commitment, and to be able to advance on the initiatives announced in the
recent Speech from the Throne, the government launched a major review of all expenditure
programs, with the results of this exercise to be announced in the fall of 2004.
At the provincial level, despite the balanced budget commitments in many provinces, a sizable
deficit has emerged for this year, reflecting pressures on the public health care system as well
as costs related to the SARS/BSE outbreaks. Partly driven by balanced budget legislations,
provinces have responded by delaying previously scheduled tax cuts and announcing spending
cuts.

-3Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors agreed with the thrust of the staff appraisal. In particular, they commended
Canada’s strong monetary and fiscal policy framework which, together with the structural
reforms introduced since the early 1990s, has enabled the Canadian economy to respond
flexibly to negative shocks in 2003 and provided a solid foundation for recovery.
Directors agreed that the near-term macroeconomic outlook appeared broadly favorable, with
growth likely to rebound next year, underpinned by household spending and a quick pick up in
business investment. Nonetheless, the recent softening of the economy underlined the
downside risks, especially given the Canadian dollar’s strength and the possibility that this could
weigh heavily on net exports and domestic profitability.
Against this background, Directors agreed that macroeconomic policies should remain
supportive. Given the limited room for fiscal maneuver under the existing medium-term
budgetary framework, Directors observed that the principal responsibility for fostering a cyclical
recovery lay with monetary policy.
In this regard, Directors welcomed the Bank of Canada’s recent decision to lower interest rates.
They acknowledged that special factors had clouded the signals provided by inflation data, and
that considerable uncertainty was associated with estimates of the output gap. Nonetheless,
with the apparent widening of the output gap, the appreciation of the Canadian dollar weighing
on activity, and core inflation expected to remain low, Directors noted that there was room to cut
interest rates further, if needed to support the ongoing recovery, especially in view of the
credibility of the authorities’ inflation target. They commended the transparency of the
authorities’ inflation targeting framework, while a few Directors saw merit in providing more
detail regarding the Bank of Canada’s macroeconomic forecasts.
Directors welcomed Canada’s commitment to exchange rate flexibility, which had been helpful
in facilitating the adjustment to global macroeconomic imbalances. Although the speed and
extent of the appreciation of the Canadian dollar had raised concern, they did not view the
exchange rate as significantly out of line with underlying fundamentals, especially considering
Canada’s current account surplus and improved net foreign liability position, and supportive
world commodity prices.
Directors commended the authorities’ overall fiscal framework, which had been remarkably
successful in achieving substantial debt reduction over the past decade and has left Canada
relatively well-positioned to cope with the fiscal burdens stemming from population aging.
However, with pressures on pension and health care systems likely to grow in coming decades,
they agreed that federal and provincial fiscal authorities would need to sustain debt reduction.
Several Directors believed that the existing two-year budgetary planning framework could
usefully be complemented by a clearer longer-term anchor, and expanded to allow for more
flexibility over the cycle, though others thought the existing framework was adequate to sustain
Canada’s strong fiscal performance.
Directors noted that challenges had emerged in the context of the short-term fiscal outlook,
especially in light of the economic slowdown and the spending initiatives introduced with the
2003 Budget, particularly on health-care related transfers to the provinces. They suggested,

-4therefore, that the forthcoming budget demonstrate a firm commitment to rebuilding normal
budgetary reserves. Directors also welcomed the authorities’ recent commitment to introducing
a comprehensive expenditure review and shifting fiscal priorities toward expenditure control.
Although they did not see a need for broad-based tax cuts, they observed that there was still
scope to improve incentives in the tax system to facilitate labor and capital market efficiency
and maintain competitiveness vis-à-vis the United States. They also encouraged efforts to
ensure that the withdrawal of social benefits at the low end of the income scale did not result in
excessive marginal effective tax rates.
Directors cautioned that difficult spending issues at both the federal and provincial levels still
need to be tackled. They supported the recent federal-provincial Health Accord as a means to
provide greater certainty regarding the funding for provincial health programs, but saw scope for
strengthening incentives to contain health care costs and usage. Directors highlighted the
importance of ensuring that amendments to the system of federal-provincial equalization
payments reduce its complexity, and contain the burden on the federal budget.
Although the public pension system and other age-related programs appear sound, Directors
agreed that further reforms may still be warranted. For example, they considered that improving
the actuarial fairness of the adjustment to Canada Pension Plan (CPP) benefits for those who
retire before or after the statutory retirement age, or gradually rising the retirement age to take
into account increases in longevity, could help encourage labor market participation and
possibly enable an eventual reduction in the CPP premium rate.
Directors noted the resilience of the Canadian financial system in the face of recent shocks, and
commended the authorities’ sound regulatory framework and proactive efforts to strengthen
corporate accounting and governance standards. In their view, the need to ensure the
soundness, efficiency, and global competitiveness of the Canadian financial sector argued in
favor of harmonizing securities market regulation and legislation—including in the context of the
establishment of a single regulator. Similarly, the recent weaknesses of some defined-benefit
pension plans illustrated the potential benefits of strengthening disclosure requirements and
rules governing contribution holidays, and of further harmonizing federal-provincial regulation
and supervision. With respect to bank merger proposals, Directors also welcomed efforts to
increase the transparency of the process and criteria governing them in order to facilitate the
Canadian financial system’s response to increasing global competition.
Directors observed that the use of the employment insurance system to fund broader social
policy objectives has resulted in cross-subsidization across industries and regions. They
suggested, therefore, that the pending review of the system be used as an opportunity to
consider experience-rated premiums and alternative funding options.
Some Directors observed that the gap in productivity between the United States and Canada
has widened slightly in recent years, and they encouraged continued efforts toward reforms that
would enhance the efficiency of the Canadian economy, including with regard to barriers to
foreign direct investment and inter-provincial trade.
Directors remarked favorably on the openness and transparency of Canada’s external trade
system, and noted that easing import barriers further—especially in the area of agriculture—
would encourage greater competitive efficiencies and complement Canada’s overseas

-5development objectives. They encouraged the authorities to play a leadership role in efforts to
bridge differences among the participants of the Doha Round. They also welcomed Canada’s
commitment to achieve its goal of increasing overseas development assistance.

Public Information Notices (PINs) are issued, (i) at the request of a member country, following the
conclusion of the Article IV consultation for countries seeking to make known the views of the IMF to the
public. This action is intended to strengthen IMF surveillance over the economic policies of member
countries by increasing the transparency of the IMF's assessment of these policies; and (ii) following
policy discussions in the Executive Board at the decision of the Board. The Staff Report for the 2004
Article IV Consultation with Canada is also available.
