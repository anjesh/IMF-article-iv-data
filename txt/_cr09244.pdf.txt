INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
GREECE
Staff Report for the 2009 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the European Department
(In consultation with other departments)
Approved by Ajai Chopra and Martin Mühleisen
June 30, 2009
Executive Summary
Background: Economic activity has held up better than in partner countries, but a recession seems
unavoidable. Inflation is receding but remains above the euro-area average. Banks have weathered
well the downturn so far, including with confidence-boosting government assistance and enhanced
supervision. The increasing fiscal deficit reflects cyclical effects partly offset by cuts in the high
structural deficit.
Challenges: Fiscal and external imbalances are high and competitiveness has weakened. Fiscal
consolidation cannot be postponed. Reforms to bolster competitiveness and growth are essential to
avoid slipping into stagnation.
Staff views: Greece needs a coherent fiscal adjustment path, based on durable measures, aimed at
returning the debt ratio to a downward trajectory. Revenue enhancements are needed, but the main
tasks are to address the wage bill and structurally worsening entitlement programs. The operating
environment for banks remains challenging, and close domestic and cross-border supervision and
cooperation is appropriate. The authorities need to work with social partners to forge a tri-partite
approach, based on dialogue and transparency of tasks and burdens, to address serious
competitiveness concerns.
Authorities’ views: The authorities aim to cut the fiscal deficit as agreed with EU partners to limit
debt accumulation, predicated on a more favorable economic outlook than staff’s. They agree that
competitiveness needs to be strengthened, and point to progress in privatizing state enterprises, tight
public sector incomes policy, active labor market policies, and implementing the EU Services
Directive by end-2009 as steps in this direction.
The mission team: B. Traa (Head), M. Moreno Badia, F. Jaumotte, D. Velculescu (all EUR).
Country interlocutors: the Minister of Economy and Finance, the Minister of Employment and
Social Protection, the Governor of the Bank of Greece, Officials at the Prime Minister’s office, and
staff in these and other government ministries and agencies.
Outreach: included meetings with banks, trade unions, industrialists, and private analysts.

2.
Imbalances persisted. Continued high fiscal deficits prevented the public debt from
falling below 95 percent of GDP. Inflation and labor-cost growth exceeded that of trading
partners and eroded competitiveness. The current account deficit was 14½ percent of GDP in
2008. The international investment position (IIP) was -75 percent of GDP at end-2008.
3.
The global financial crisis weakened sentiment and sent spreads soaring, causing
a financing scare. Business and consumer confidence dropped, as elsewhere. Borrowing
spreads on 10-year Bunds jumped to 300 bp (the highest in the euro area) before receding to
185 bp recently, and S&P downgraded Greece to two notches from minimum ECB collateral
standards. Borrowing costs in absolute terms were kept in check with Bund yields falling and
by issuing at shorter terms, but effective real rates increased. Greece’s sensitivity to the
financial crisis is linked to its precarious fiscal position and lack of structural progress, with
higher spreads foreshadowing higher fiscal costs over the medium term.

4.
A lack of political consensus hampers policy making. The center-right New
Democracy party won re-election in September 2007 with a thin majority. The opposition
socialist party has won the European Parliament ballot of June 7 and is asking for early
elections, which could be triggered by Presidential elections in March 2010. Political
cooperation is low, and demonstrations and strikes are common.

II. CYCLICAL DEVELOPMENTS
5.
Growth slowed to 2.9 percent in 2008 (Table 1). Domestic demand eased, led by
investment, and employment fell at year-end (Figure 2). Greece’s relative resilience was
partly explained by consumption, facilitated by high wage growth and moderate household
and corporate indebtedness (the high debt is in the public sector). Import volumes contracted
sharply, but the current account deficit still worsened with lower terms of trade and a near
doubling of net factor payments since 2005.
Households debt is below the euro average...

…as is debt of non-financial corporations.

6.
National accounts data for Q1 2009 and high-frequency indicators suggest
growth is slowing quickly. First quarter output declined by 4.8 percent qoq, saar. Industrial
production, orders, and retail sales have dropped sharply, as elsewhere (Figure 3). The Baltic
Dry Index, reflecting demand for the key shipping industry in Greece, declined significantly
from its peak in 2008. Tourism arrivals are down.
7.
Nevertheless, wage growth has remained high. Wage agreements for 2008–2009
incorporated high inflation expectations, resulting in 12 percent nominal wage hikes over this
period (Figure 4). With inflation declining at end-2008, real wage growth turned up, assisting
household incomes. With wage growth outstripping the euro average, competitiveness further
suffered and firms are now reducing overtime or cutting informal deals to lower costs. The
authorities see the informal market as a buffer in Greece.
8.
A weakening operating environment has reduced bank profits. So far, the global
financial turmoil has had limited direct impact on banks because they have no legacy toxic
assets or SIVs and are retail oriented. However, profitability is falling with higher funding
costs, slowing activity, and asset quality erosion in Greece and Southeastern Europe (SEE).
Credit growth has slowed (Figure 5). S&P and Moody’s have downgraded several Greek
banks. Bank equities are down sharply year-on-year (Figure 6).

Revenue shortfalls and rising
expenditure are widening the fiscal
deficit. The deficit exceeded the
Maastricht limit in 2007, after exiting

III. OUTLOOK: UNCERTAIN, BUT DOWNSIDE RISKS REMAIN
11.
Staff projects negative growth in 2009 and 2010. Greece is feeling the downturn
with some delay. Moreover, even with the staff’s weaker outlook relative to the authorities,
Greece’s growth decline from peak to trough would still be milder than for the euro-area as a
whole. Further decoupling from the euro area, which is experiencing a sharp recession, is
unlikely. The main forces in 2009 are lower investments and exports, destocking, and a
decline in private consumption as confidence and employment have dropped. Net exports are
expected to contribute to growth. Staff projects some recovery in late 2010, as partner
countries emerge from the recession. Inflation is projected to remain above the euro average,
with unemployment reaching over 10 percent in 2010. The medium-term recovery will likely
be hindered by impaired competitiveness, still large external imbalances, and the need to cut
the fiscal deficit to limit risks.

The current account deficit is expected to narrow. Shipping receipts (a third of
exports) have dropped with lower world trade and will take time to recover. Tourism receipts
(over a third of exports) are also expected to fall, with lower demand from high-income
countries and increased competition from neighbors whose exchange rates are weakening.
Nevertheless, with lower absorption in the short run, imports are projected to contract
sharply, leading to lower trade deficits. Over the medium term, the trade deficit is expected to
improve with lower outlays for ships and recovering world demand. However, the net
income deficit has become structural, reflecting the large negative IIP (Figure 7, Table 2, and
Annex I on External Debt Sustainability). The authorities broadly share these views.
13.
Staff sees the balance of risks on the downside, and that sustained firmer policies
are needed to address risks. Staff sees risks that domestic demand may drop further in 2010
if real wages are reset downward in the next bargaining round, or if employment were to
drop faster than currently foreseen. 2 Deteriorating competitiveness and high crowding-out
public debt increase risks of prolonged slow growth. The large imbalances, and lack of
reform consensus, could result in a change in market sentiment for Greece. Thus, the key
implication of the different outlooks between staff and the authorities is that staff sees more
urgency for stronger policies, which are needed to shore up confidence and to avoid a replay
of the spike in spreads in an already weakened real/financial environment. If external
financing weakens again, the current account deficit could unwind rapidly and growth could
falter badly (Box 1).
14.
The authorities’ outlook is more benign. They note that staff has underestimated
growth in Greece in recent years and expect activity to be slightly positive, in part supported
by infrastructure spending with EU funds and mobilizing PPPs and more buoyant tourism
activity compared to staff. Moreover, they see smaller spillover effects from the global
downturn because of Greece’s reliance on small and medium-size enterprises and relatively
low dependence on exports. While the authorities acknowledged that some downward
adjustment of their projections could not be excluded as further information on developments
came in, they felt that the outlook would remain less risky than considered by staff.
2

Staff’s outlook for 2010 is weaker than consensus in part because of the delay in the Greek downturn by about
one quarter, which causes a slightly larger negative carryover next year in the average growth number.

13

Box 1. Linkages and Spillovers
Greece’s open economy is linked to the rest of the world through trade and financial channels.
Inward spillovers: Greek exports are particularly vulnerable to shocks in SEE and the euro
area. Exporters have expanded their activities into SEE countries, which absorbed almost a quarter of
total Greek nonfuel exports at end-2008. In the global crisis, Greek exports to the region would
commensurately weaken. Moreover, transportation services are subject to downside risks from
sharply declining global trade. Finally, tourism receipts are vulnerable to worse-than-expected
recessions in advanced economies (Germany, U.K., Italy, U.S. bring half of tourism earnings) and to
increased competition from neighboring countries (e.g., Turkey and Croatia). Banks’ credit quality is
likely to erode as external weakness feeds into the domestic economy, as well from direct lending to
tourism and shipping.
The Greek banking sector is directly exposed to SEE. In a search for high profit margins, Greek
banks have become major players in the previously fast-growing SEE countries. However, these
exposures are turning into sources of pressure on banks’ balance sheets and income as local
economies deteriorate and foreign exchange volatility dents the repayment ability of unhedged
borrowers.
Outward spillovers: Euro-area countries hold a large part of Greece’s external debt and could
be affected should problems arise in Greece. Greece’s external debt is some 147 percent of GDP,
of which around 2/3rds is public sector debt. External debt is poised to grow as external imbalances
remain large. Euro-area countries already hold over €200 billion of this debt.
Abrupt financial adjustment in Greece could lead to banking problems in SEE. Subsidiaries of
Greek banks in SEE have high loan-to-deposit ratios (far higher than in Greece itself), hitherto relying
heavily on parents’ funding. Therefore, SEE could face difficulties should the Greek (and other)
banks constrain parental support in the face of liquidity or capital needs. The authorities agree that
financial protectionism should be avoided, as this would also be highly damaging for Greece itself,
given it’s own very large external financing need. Greek banks are participating with others in the
bank coordination initiative (Vienna) to seek an orderly transition toward lower external funding
dependence in SEE.

IV. POLICY DISCUSSIONS: BOLSTERING CONFIDENCE AND SUSTAINABILITY
15.
Given high vulnerabilities in growth, public finances, and the financial sector,
policies need to restore confidence and bolster sustainability. Pressures in banking and
the public finances could dampen sentiment, with detrimental effects on growth. Financial
supervision should remain tight and the authorities should be ready to act were systemic
pressures to arise. Greece cannot postpone fiscal consolidation. Given weak political support,
adjustment will need to be realistic, yet show strong commitment to improving the fiscal
balance step-by-step. Structural reforms are imperative to improve competitiveness for
renewed growth.

The financial system appears resilient to the slowdown but the authorities should closely
monitor banks and be prepared to act if needed.

increased provisioning and
margin compression. Bank capital is adequate but declining (Tables 3–5)
17.

Staff welcomed the authorities’ proactive response to the financial crisis:

•

Bank support package. Greece was early to implement bank assistance via public
capital injections, liquidity assistance, and funding guarantees, which bolstered
confidence (Box 2). Staff stressed that to ensure sound lending and avoid market
distortions, government’s bank involvement should remain at arm’s length. The
package has not been fully used, but is best kept in place preemptively.

•

Supervision. The Bank of Greece (BoG) has intensified monitoring and contacts with
banks’ managements so that additional steps (including increased provisioning and
capital strengthening) are implemented to minimize risks, as appropriate.

•

Cross-border cooperation. BoG has stepped up the exchange of information with
counterparts in SEE and urged banks to bring credit expansion abroad more in line
with local deposit growth and funding. Staff agreed that Greek bank loan/deposit
ratios in some SEE countries are too high, but noted that the correction needs to be
gradual and should avoid triggering financial nationalism, while encouraging the
authorities to continue developing their strong relationships with supervisors in SEE.
The authorities should also conduct crisis-management exercises with SEE partners.

•

Crisis management. A new committee at BoG monitors financial stability and is
implementing internal procedures for identifying signs of deterioration and providing
timely information for the management of crisis. 3

•

Financial Stability Report (FSR). The authorities have started publishing a FSR to
inform the public about the health of the financial system. Staff recommended the
issuance of a simultaneous version in English and update of the report at midyear.
Box 2. Bank Support Measures Through end-May 2009
The banking package is in line with the common framework agreed by euro-area countries:
•

The limit on deposit insurance was raised from €20,000 to €100,000 per person per
bank.

•

Capital injections are available up to €5 billion in preferred shares, including a buyback
option after five years, dividend of 10 percent, and state representation on the board of
directors with rights to veto top executives’ pay. Ordinary dividends have been
restricted up to 35 percent of profits in the form of shares. So far, €4.1 billion has been
subscribed, increasing system high-quality Tier-1 capital from 7.9 to 10.1 percent.

•

Liquidity assistance is providing up to €8 billion in special-issue zero-coupon
government bonds eligible for ECB discounts against collateral. About €4.4 billion has
been approved until now.

•

Funding guarantees up to €15 billion (for a fee and a duration up to three years) can be
issued until end-2009. So far, €3 billion have been used as borrowing costs have
increased with the rise in sovereign spreads.

18.
Stress tests (conducted jointly by BoG and staff) suggest that the banking system
has enough buffers to weather the expected downturn. The tests ascertained four banking
system risks:
•

Credit risk. Nonperforming loans (NPL) have been persistently high during the upswing.
Moreover, exposures to cyclically sensitive sectors—shipping, tourism, and
construction—are large for some banks. Credit quality could therefore worsen in the
downturn.

•

Cross-border risks. Total exposure in
SEE at €53 billion (203 percent of
equity) is relatively large (Figure 8).
Bank portfolios could experience
pressure as local economies slow and
foreign exchange volatility impairs
borrowers.

•

Market risk. Although trading books are
relatively small, high volatility on
equity, bond, and foreign exchange
markets could generate losses.

•

Liquidity risk. Banks are increasingly vulnerable to reduced wholesale funding as the
bunching of maturities creates rollover risk (Figure 9). Reliance on short-term ECB
repos has increased to some €45 billion.

The stress tests suggest that profits, capital cushions (including with the government’s
assistance), and stepped-up provisioning should provide enough resources to absorb foreseen
losses. Assuming simultaneous shocks, some institutions may require up to a total of
€2.9 billion in new capital (1.2 percent of GDP)—a relatively moderate amount. Banks
appear to have enough liquid funds, but need to prepare gradual exit strategies to reduce
dependence on ECB facilities.

19.
Nevertheless, the authorities agreed that the near-term banking outlook remains
challenging, and continued vigilance is needed. The operating environment is expected to
remain difficult as the world goes through the recession. Moreover, should the downturn be
more prolonged and deeper than currently projected, and financial tightening return,
domestic credit quality may deteriorate further than envisaged, and portfolios in SEE could
face additional pressures. These risks need to be managed cautiously and the authorities
should remain prepared to act if systemic pressures arise. In such case, the authorities agreed
that market solutions should be sought first (e.g., merging banks). Staff stressed that if public
support for individual banks were required, this should be designed to minimize government
involvement with clear exit strategies.

20.
The authorities stressed that the bank support package is not aimed at
influencing credit allocation, either domestically or cross-border. Furthermore, they
noted that Greek banks had slowed credit growth in SEE for sensible internal prudential
reasons, and banks themselves indicated that they were committed to keeping their exposures
in SEE, as they see further potential growth in these countries. Finally, BoG explained that it
has boosted banks’ liquidity requirements. The authorities noted that conditions were
improving with debt and interbank markets slowly opening up, which would, over time,
allow banks to reduce reliance on ECB support.
21.
Weaknesses in the insurance sector are being addressed. Insurance is
underdeveloped in Greece (accounting for only 2 percent of GDP). After becoming
operational in 2008, the Private Insurance Supervisory Committee intensified supervision,
uncovering some instances of relatively small capital need. Corrective measures are being
taken and staff urged prompt resolution of remaining issues.
22.
Finally, the discussions touched upon monetary conditions, which were seen as
having been broadly supportive. With the ECB setting interest rates for the average of the
euro area, and Greece having run persistently higher-than-average inflation, real interest rates
have been accommodative in recent years, Generally, this continued to be the case with
policy rates falling and Greek inflation remaining above the average, but somewhat tighter
lending standards and the increase in the sovereign benchmark spreads and downgrades were
erasing some of these benefits and possibly already crowding out some private sector
activity. Nevertheless, already issued Greek mortgages tend to be linked to the short-term
euribor, which had fallen to record lows, imparting a cash-flow benefit on many households.
Also, as noted, the liquidity assistance by the ECB (repos) had been, and will continue to be
for the near term, of major assistance to Greek banks and, indirectly, to funding the
sovereign. Interlocutors agreed that without these monetary accommodations, Greek
financing pressures would have been considerably higher.
B. Strengthening the Fiscal Position
Operating control needs to improve, and policies should emphasize structural over one-off
measures. Budgets need to aim at long-run sustainability.
Short run
23.
Greece is entering the downturn with an already weak fiscal position. Failures to
stick to budget plans, deficit-increasing one-off measures, expenditure slippages, and ad-hoc
revenue efforts have coincided with persistent deficits above 3 percent since 2000
(Figure 10). Indeed, as monetary conditions had been accommodative, fiscal policy had not
been nearly tight enough during the boom years. Social transfers have increased by over
3 percentage points of GDP, outpacing social contributions. The wage bill has also been
rising. In this context, the European Commission has reinvoked the EDP for Greece, asking
to reduce the deficit below 3 percent by 2010. Staff is concerned that large and growing data
discrepancies (including “stock-flow adjustments”) between cash accounts and those of the
SGP could harbor a worse underlying deficit than currently reported. These data
shortcomings are a recurring problem in Greece, with interlocutors noting that the debt

21
consistently rises faster than indicated by the SGP deficits reported to Eurostat. Restoring
confidence requires durable consolidation and improved accounting systems that allow the
authorities to respond in a timely way to slippages and the publication of more stable fiscal
indicators.
24.
Staff projects the headline deficit to widen and public debt to increase sharply in
2009 and 2010. With staff’s projection of economic contraction and if no further measures
are taken, the general government deficit is expected to reach 6.2 percent of GDP in 2009
and 7.5 percent in 2010 (Table 6). Including the banking assistance package, public debt
could rise to 109 percent of GDP in 2009 and 115 percent of GDP by 2010. 4 In view of
unfavorable fiscal outturn in the first quarter, staff sees the balance of risks on the downside.
These projections factor in the fiscal consolidation measures implemented by the authorities
through May 2009.
25.
The authorities concurred that there is no room for a fiscal stimulus. Stimulus
measures have been moderate, rightly focusing on assisting vulnerable groups such as the
unemployed and poor. At the same time, staff advised against subsidies to high-income
groups, including for car sales, new mortgage guarantees, and cash grants to self-employed
professionals, which do little for growth but further increase the debt. The authorities said
that these were targeted to high-employment
sectors and were temporary.

Consolidation measures taken so
far could help to improve the structural
primary balance by nearly 1 percent of
GDP in 2009. These efforts are welcome,
especially the components that are durable,
such as moderating public wages (extended
to pensions), cuts in discretionary spending,
higher excises, and the new property tax
(delayed from 2008). At the same time, staff
advised against further use of one-off
measures such as the tax amnesty and the
one-time PIT surcharge for high-income
taxpayers, noting that these could even lead
to lower future tax receipts if they induce
more tax avoidance. The authorities have
also announced a reduction in the wage bill

through attrition—replacing every two job leavers with one hire. However, there is concern
that this objective could be complicated by the authorities’ plan to substitute up to 60,000
persons from unemployed to the (local) public sector. The net cost may not be high, as
unemployment benefits will be transformed into employment benefits, but there are risks that
some could become permanent, thus burdening the wage bill in the future. Strict
implementation of this measure will be key.
27.
The authorities have agreed under the EDP to reduce the deficit to 3.7 percent of
GDP in 2009 and below 3 percent in 2010. They acknowledge that these objectives are
difficult, especially since the starting deficit in 2008 has been increased to 5.0 percent, and
because growth is likely lower than initially foreseen. Indeed, the fiscal outturn in the first
quarter of 2009 was very unfavorable, which the authorities ascribe to frontloading of
expenditures to cushion the downturn. The government intends to take stock in June (after
the EU elections) and then formulate new measures; nevertheless, they expect more revenues
than staff, given their more optimistic outlook. Under the EDP, they will present a detailed
plan to the EU Commission in October 2009. Staff noted that if growth falters, trying to
reach the 3.7 percent target at all costs may not be helpful if this leads to plugging holes with
poor quality measures that weaken confidence. An ambitious but doable high-quality plan is
better than attempting a series of ad-hoc efforts.
28.
Greece needs a coherent sustained fiscal adjustment plan based on permanent
measures that can be monitored closely to cement credibility. Given Greece’s high level
of debt and attendant vulnerabilities, such a plan should aim at boosting confidence, which
could even support growth (an expansionary fiscal contraction). Staff recommended annual
adjustment of about 1½ percent of GDP in permanent measures beginning in 2010 to place
public debt on a declining path. Since, on baseline, the underlying structural balance is
deteriorating every year (including because of aging pressures on social transfers), this effort
would still take until 2013 before Greece is well below the 3-percent Maastricht limit. Such a
strategy, permitting automatic stabilizers to function around the adjustment path, would
lower the debt ratio from 2012.

29.
The authorities concurred that fiscal consolidation measures should be
high-quality, durable, and forward-looking. On the revenue side, efforts should focus on
income that escapes taxation in order to spread the tax burden more fairly. This can be done
by broadening tax bases by phasing out exemptions and deductions; taxing the self-employed
and the informal sector; and increasing further selected excise taxes to the euro-area average.
On the spending side, wage moderation (extended to pensions) and restrictive hiring policies
should be continued to curb the fast growing wage bill (text table). In this respect, the
government explained that from 2010, it will implement a different wage-policy system for
new employees, which should reinforce expenditure restraint. Longer-run action also needs
to be taken to address the spending pressures arising from growing social transfers.
30.
The authorities differed with staff’s proposal to postpone planned tax cuts.
Given low revenues, staff recommended that corporate and personal income tax rate cuts of
1 percent a year through 2014 be suspended until the deficit is confirmed to be below
3 percent of GDP. The authorities argued that this would be politically difficult, as these are
commitments already passed in parliament. They also thought that revenue losses may be
small due to the relatively small base of these taxes and Laffer-curve effects.
31.
Efforts are underway to improve expenditure control and introduce program
budgeting. In health care, steps are underway to lower procurement costs; hospitals are
developing financial statements according to international accounting standards; and
legislative action is being designed to curb pharmaceutical costs. Pilot initiatives are being
expanded toward integrating full performance budgeting by 2012 and implementing
top-down multiannual budget ceilings for each ministry by 2011. To this end, accounting is
being improved toward a modified cash basis with help of new management information
systems that should start operating in 2010. Staff welcomed these efforts.

25
32.
Public enterprise performance should be strengthened. Recurring operating
deficits give rise to debts that periodically get taken over by the Treasury. The authorities
emphasized the progress made by privatizing Olympic Airlines and starting to restructure the
railway company. Staff recommended setting a 5-year deadline to eliminate enterprise
operating deficits, including by increasing tariffs to cover costs and incentives for good
service and speeding up privatization.

Long-run
33.
Greece has the highest long-run aging costs
in the euro area; policies need to be strengthened
significantly to deal with this over time. Greek
population growth is forecast to turn negative in 2017,
with growing dependency ratios and reduced labor
input, resulting in declining potential growth over time
(Figure 11). Calculations by the EU Aging Working
Group show incremental aging costs of 15.9 percent of
GDP through 2060—mostly a rise in pensions.
Combining a long-run projection of future fiscal
primary deficits on current policies that include these
aging costs (in NPV terms) with other assets and
liabilities already on the Greek public sector balance
sheet results in a deeply negative public sector net
worth of -395 percent of GDP at end-2008—
underscoring grave fiscal vulnerabilities (Figure 12 and
Table 7). 5

34.
Greece urgently needs further pension reform. The 2008 reform that combined
133 pension funds into 13 funds is a good step toward harmonizing pension regimes and
implementing further reforms. This reform could generate needed savings if administrative
improvements are implemented tightly, such as issuing and requiring social security numbers
for all citizens and services; cross-checking data for revenue enhancement; and accelerating
the implementation of new IT and accounting systems. However, early retirement incentives
remain strong and statutory replacement rates very high, and staff noted that parametric
reforms remain essential to ensure that pensions of next generations can be paid and should
not be postponed. Because an informed domestic debate is crucial to foster consensus around
ambitious reforms, staff suggested that the Actuarial Authority be provided the resources and
data to prepare and publish annual actuarial reports for all funds as an input for drafting each
year’s budget.

C. Enhancing Competitiveness
Competitiveness is slipping, and Greece needs deeper reforms to boost its potential.
35.
Indicators suggest a significant competitiveness gap. Measures based on relative
consumer prices and unit labor costs show a REER appreciation of 20–37 percent since
Greece’s entry into the euro area in 2001 (Figure 13). Although restructuring has taken place
over the last decade, as suggested by technological upgrading of exports, increasing
specialization in high-growth services, and orientation toward fast-growing Balkan markets,
Greece has lost market share (at least in volume terms) and competitiveness relative to
peers. 6 Strong wage growth and the appreciating euro are further eroding competitiveness.
Staff estimates based on CGER methodologies indicate a comparable gap of 20–30 percent,
broadly similar to last year's assessment. The authorities agreed that competitiveness has
weakened, but pointed out that CGER estimates need to be interpreted carefully (especially
in catching up countries)—they believe that the gap is smaller than estimated by staff. 7

Comprehensive structural
reforms can boost competitiveness
and growth. Greece’s price
competitiveness gap reflects high
administrative costs and inefficiencies,
high margins in several sectors, and
rising labor costs. Addressing these
impediments requires reforms in three
areas:

30
political appointees to reduce costs and increase efficiency; accelerate privatization of
public enterprises; and publish more information, including financial statements of state
enterprises and hospitals, to increase public acceptance of reforms.
•

Product and service markets need to be further liberalized. Greece is lagging peers
on various indicators (Figure 14). Steps have been taken to improve the business
environment, boost competition in the telecommunications industry, and modernize the
electricity wholesale market, but more can be done to rationalize legislation and cut
administrative burdens, liberalize network industries and unbundle the gas and electricity
markets, implement an ambitious EU Services Directive to liberalize professional
services, retail trade, and other activities, and enhance the resources of the Competition
Authority to increase its effectiveness.

•

Labor market reforms are key to
achieving lower unit labor costs. More
government spending cannot be used as a
substitute for labor reforms to solve
unemployment. Promoting a tri-partite social
contract between employers, unions, and the
public sector, should aim at cooperative
bargaining to favor employment growth over
income growth at this time, requiring
understandings on wage moderation in return
for investment and employment promotion.
Greece can also facilitate more part-time
work to boost participation of youths and
women in the labor force, and ease
employment protection legislation.

The authorities agreed with the thrust of these suggestions, albeit favoring a
gradual implementation. Drawing on cross-country experience, staff pointed out that the
current crisis could be used to spur ambitious and faster reforms than achieved in Greece so
far. 8 The authorities noted that they are committed to a comprehensive Lisbon reform
agenda, as outlined in the National Reform Programme for 2008–2010. They planned on
setting clear priorities and tackling reforms one at a time to manage opposition and steadily
move the agenda forward.

V. STATISTICS
38.
Some data weaknesses hamper analysis (Appendix II). Statistics on growth and the
fiscal position tend to be revised significantly, complicating projections and policy making.
Delays in fiscal data make it difficult for the authorities to respond in a timely manner. The
mapping of fiscal and balance of payments data to the national accounts is not
straightforward, and their differences tend to be unstable over time. Cash fiscal data show
consistently weaker results than accrual SGP data, which is inadequately explained. The
authorities said that several projects are underway to improve monitoring, accounting
systems, and reporting, and they are working with Eurostat to revise and improve the national
accounts in 2010. Staff welcomed these steps, which need firmer political support from the
highest levels.
VI. STAFF APPRAISAL
39.
The Greek economy has shown resilience but the staff nevertheless projects a
recession. Fiscal and external imbalances have grown and Greece needs a coherent and
sustained plan to correct them and bolster confidence. Such a program should include
maintaining a sound banking system, reducing public debt and deficits, and lowering costs in
bureaucracy, product, service, and labor markets.
40.
Near-term prospects are sobering. Greece has felt the downturn with some delay.
Given that the economy is highly integrated with the euro area, which is experiencing a sharp
recession, decoupling is unlikely. Moreover, underlying vulnerabilities need to be addressed
with strong upfront policies. Greece can ill-afford a new spike in spreads in a weaker financialreal sector environment. Compounding these risks, high wage growth has further eroded

34
competitiveness as inflation persists above trading partners’ average, and structural rigidities
imply costs that have contributed to the large current account deficit. These factors increase
the likelihood of a prolonged period of slow growth. Staff therefore views the balance of
risks still on the downside.
41.
Greek banks have weathered the global crisis relatively well, but also felt the
crisis. Funding costs have increased while loan activity has dropped with deleveraging. The
authorities’ response has been appropriate and consistent with the EU framework—the bank
assistance package has boosted confidence and proven highly valuable. Moreover,
supervisors have intensified monitoring and expanded contacts with banks’ managements to
minimize risks.
42.
Stress tests suggest that the banking system has enough buffers to weather the
expected slowdown. Systemic risks appear contained as profits, capital cushions, and
provisioning should provide enough resources to absorb impaired loans in Greece and SEE.
Liquidity policies of the ECB are also helping, debt and interbank markets are slowly
opening up, and there remains room under the banking package.
43.
Nevertheless, near-term operating conditions for banks remain challenging, and
vigilance is needed. Domestic credit quality may deteriorate further than envisaged, and
portfolios in SEE could face further pressures. These risks need to be managed cautiously
with a well-targeted set of policies. Direct involvement in banks should remain limited and
focused on maintaining sound lending. Unused portions of the banking package should be
kept in place preemptively. Banks need to prepare to unwind positions with the ECB.
44.
Greek banks’ commitment to stay involved in SEE is welcome. Moreover, the
authorities continue to strengthen their relationships with Central Banks and supervisory
colleagues in SEE countries, which could be further expanded by conducting joint
crisis-management exercises.
45.
The authorities should remain prepared to act if systemic pressures were still to
arise. They are correct to seek market solutions first (e.g., merging banks), and if public
support for individual banks is required, this should include exit strategies. The new
Financial Stability Report is welcome and should become a regular feature.
46.
Fiscal consolidation cannot be postponed. On unchanged policies, the headline
deficit is expected to widen and public debt to increase sharply for several years. This
outlook has been reflected in spiking spreads on government bonds as liquidity in financial
markets tightened. Spreads are now easing, but a return to the low levels prior to the crisis is
unlikely and risks of new spikes remain if policies are not strengthened. Given weaknesses in
fiscal operating controls, downside surprises cannot be ruled out and should be countered as
they occur.
47.
The deficit-reducing measures of 2009 are welcome and further steps are
needed. There is no room for stimulus. The government’s response to the crisis has rightly
included protecting the poor. Further measures must be consistent, durable, of high quality,
and forward looking, to lower underlying deficits and debt. This plan should be clearly

35
communicated to the public and offer monitorable high-frequency milestones to establish a
confidence anchor. With strong confidence, fiscal adjustment can be expansionary.
48.
Annual adjustment of about 1½ percent of GDP in permanent measures
beginning in 2010 would place the debt ratio on a downward path by 2012. Automatic
stabilizers can be allowed to operate around this path. Pressure from special interest groups
and sectors is likely to grow as economic weakness unfolds, but should be resisted.
49.
The measures should be of high quality. There is a need to improve revenue from
income that presently escapes taxation. The authorities’ planned income policies are valuable
if fully implemented as they would contribute to moderating the public wage bill and pension
costs. Given very high projected aging costs, deeper social security reform should not be
postponed; achieving a consensus with the public will require time and dialogue.
50.
Restoring competitiveness requires comprehensive structural reforms. The
government and social partners need to forge buy-in and stronger ownership of the agenda.
This should involve streamlining the costly public sector, reducing administrative burdens,
completing network industry reforms, and ambitiously implementing the EU Services
Directive. Labor reforms should aim at lower unit labor costs and higher employment,
supported in tripartite agreements between employers, unions, and the public sector. Greece
also has room for more part-time work opportunities to assist youths and women. The
authorities need to implement their efforts forcefully and without delay.
51.
Improving economic statistics deserves high priority. Frequent data revisions and
difficulties in reconciling aspects of the fiscal, external, and national accounts complicate
monitoring, analysis, and policy making. Welcome improvements are underway, but
publishing higher-quality economic statistics deserves firmer support from the highest levels.
52.

It is recommended that Greece remain on the 12-month consultation cycle.

ANNEX I

1/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; ρ = change in domestic GDP deflator in euro terms, g = real GDP growth
rate, ε = nominal appreciation (increase in euro value of domestic currency), and α = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock. ρ increases with an appreciating domestic currency (ε > 0) and rising inflation
(based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels
of the last projection year.

GREECE—STATISTICAL ISSUES APPENDIX
As of June 5, 2009
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Greek economic data have some weaknesses for surveillance. Most affected areas
are: national accounts, government finance, balance of payments, and their
inter-relationships.
National Accounts: National accounts are broadly in line with the European System of
Accounts (ESA95). However, introduction of a production method approach for the quarterly
national accounts has resulted in volatility and large statistical discrepancies which render the
data less useful for assessing conjunctural economic developments and projections. In line
with other EU countries, Greece intends to change the GDP base in 2010.
The interpretation of labor market developments continues to be hampered by difficulties in
covering immigrants, which constitute, compared with other EU countries, a relatively large
fraction of the Greek labor market, and by the large size of the unrecorded economy, which
the recent national accounts revisions may not have fully captured.
Government finance statistics: The National Statistical Service of Greece compiles data on
general government revenue, expenditure, and deficit on an accrual basis in the context of
the 1995 ESA Transmission Program and the Excessive Deficit Procedure. The absence of
financing data impedes checks on data consistency, including reconciliation between the
government deficit and debt, and between government finance statistics and other
macroeconomic datasets. Fiscal data are difficult to match with public consumption and
capital formation in the national accounts. Moreover, the differences are not stable over time.
The mapping of fiscal cash accounts to the accrual SGP data is also unstable over time and
tends to be in favor of the SGP accounts—i.e. indicating a lower deficit in the SGP. Over
time, this difference tends to be at least partially reconciled and narrowed—leading to an
ex-post increase in the SGP deficit. Fiscal data, even on cash revenue, are published with
large delays. Social security data are weak and incomplete.
External sector Statistics: Balance of payments data present some departures from the fifth
edition of the Balance of Payments Manual (BPM5). Significant differences remain in
comparison to national-accounts-based current account data. The discrepancies in exports
and imports between the BOP and NA data also are unstable over time. Efforts are underway
to address these problems.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
GREECE
Staff Report for the 2009 Article IV Consultation
Supplementary Information
Prepared by the European Department
Approved by Ajai Chopra and Martin Mühleisen
July 20, 2009
The following information has become available since issuing the staff report. This
information does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal. Also attached is a draft background
section of the Public Information Notice (PIN).
The government has revised its outlook and announced new deficit-reducing measures:
•

The authorities have revised down their growth forecast for 2009 from 1.1 percent to
zero percent. They expect a recovery to begin at end-2009.

•

The authorities continue to target a fiscal deficit of 3.7 percent of GDP in 2009. To
help offset revenue shortfalls (mainly VAT) and some new expenditure increases,
they introduced a package of fiscal measures expected to yield, in gross terms,
0.8 percent of GDP (the largest is a one-off revenue measure, see text table below). In
addition, the authorities are stepping up their efforts at reducing tax evasion. They
envision announcing further measures of a structural nature in October, to assist
consolidation in the 2010 budget.

The staff has reduced its deficit projections from 2009 onward, reflecting this new
information:
•

Given the weaker macroeconomic outlook and more cautious fiscal estimates, the
staff deficit projections remain wider than those of the authorities. Taking into
account the revenue shortfalls, expenditure concessions, and the new measures, the
staff headline deficit is reduced in net terms by 0.3 percentage point to 5.9 percent of
GDP in 2009 and by 0.8 percentage point to 6.7 percent in 2010.

•

These staff estimates do not yet include €500 million sale/lease-back operations of
government properties planned for 2009 and 2010 each, which could reduce the
headline deficit further. This would only have a temporary effect on the deficit.

2
•

Taking into account the permanent components in measures and the effects of some
expenditure increases, the structural balance is estimated to improve by a net
0.4 percentage point of GDP (full-year effects) in the medium term.

•

The staff welcomes the additional policy steps taken under difficult circumstances.
Nonetheless, significant durable fiscal consolidation from 2010 onward remains
essential, including containing expenditures.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2009 Article IV Consultation with
Greece
On July 24, 2009, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV Consultation with Greece. 1
Background
After a decade of strong growth led by a domestic demand boom, Greece has started to feel
the effects of the global downturn, although with some delay. Despite initial resilience partly
explained by high wage growth and accelerated government spending, growth slowed
substantially in early-2009. The main driving forces were lower investment and exports,
destocking, and a decline in private consumption, as confidence and employment softened.
With slower domestic demand and contracting imports, the external current account deficit
started to narrow from a deficit of 14.4 percent in 2008.
The general government balance remains under pressure with revenue shortfalls and some
additional expenditure, which the government is attempting to offset in part with consolidation
measures and tax administration efforts. Despite spreads soaring in early 2009, the
government quickly completed funding for the year and spreads are now easing again.
However, the debt ratio is increasing quickly from already high levels.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
Banks, which have retail-oriented business models and a large deposit base, have weathered
well the first impact of the global crisis. The authorities were early to implement a valuable
bank assistance package with capital injections, liquidity assistance, and funding guarantees,
which bolstered confidence. However, banks’ operating environment remains difficult.
Profitability is falling with higher funding costs, slower activity, and asset quality erosion in
Greece and in Southeastern Europe. Bank capital is declining but has remained adequate.
Reflecting higher risks and the difficult economic environment, rating agencies have
downgraded several Greek banks.
High wage growth through 2009 reflects the implementation of previous wage agreements.
With wage growth and inflation outpacing the euro average, competitiveness is further
suffering and firms have turned to reducing overtime or cutting informal deals to lower costs.
External competitiveness is also hindered by insufficient domestic competition in several
sectors, high administrative costs, and inefficiencies.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the extended period of strong growth through 2008, which had
significantly narrowed the gap in real per-capita income with the EU-15. At the same time, they
noted that Greece’s large fiscal and external imbalances have made the economy vulnerable
during the global downturn. They underscored the need to address the loss in
competitiveness, which could lead the economy to face extended slow growth, especially if the
external environment and global financial conditions were to remain weak. Directors
emphasized the need to implement a comprehensive plan for fiscal consolidation and
structural reform.
Directors observed that the banking system has weathered the global crisis well, even as it
has felt the effects through higher funding costs, deleveraging, and asset-quality erosion. They
welcomed the authorities’ timely bank assistance package and their intensified domestic and
cross-border monitoring. They commended the recent stress tests, which suggest that the
banking system has enough buffers to weather the expected slowdown. Nonetheless, as
near-term operating conditions for banks remain challenging, Directors advised continued
vigilance. The authorities should continue to strengthen their relationship with central banks
and supervisory colleagues in Southeastern Europe countries, including by conducting joint
crisis-management exercises. Directors supported the authorities’ intention, in case of
systemic pressures, to seek market solutions first, and include clear exit strategies should
public support for individual banks be required. Directors emphasized the need for banks to
prepare for the unwinding of liquidity assistance from the ECB.
Directors emphasized that fiscal consolidation can no longer be postponed. The deficitreducing measures of 2009 were in the right direction, and Directors called for further durable
efforts to place the public debt on a sustainable downward path. They welcomed the measures
to protect vulnerable groups, while encouraging the authorities to continue their income
policies to help slow public wage and pension costs. Directors called for renewed efforts in
social security reform, in light of the very high projected aging costs. They encouraged the
authorities to discuss a clear fiscal strategy with the public and provide monitorable objectives
to anchor confidence.

3
Directors noted the staff’s finding that the real exchange rate has appreciated, resulting in
significantly reduced competitiveness. While observing that the estimate should be interpreted
carefully, Directors underscored the urgency of structural reform, in particular in public
administration, public enterprises, and product and labor markets. They called for streamlining
the public sector, further reducing administrative burdens, liberalizing network industries, and
implementing the EU Services Directive. Labor reforms aimed at lowering unit labor costs and
increasing employment—supported by agreements among employers, unions, and the public
sector—will also be critical. Directors encouraged the authorities to strengthen their
relationship with social partners to forge buy-in and stronger ownership of the structural
agenda. They encouraged the authorities to strengthen official statistics and to publish more
high-quality data to facilitate monitoring, analysis, and policy making.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The staff report (use the free Adobe Acrobat
Reader to view this pdf file) for the 2009 Article IV Consultation with Greece is also available.

Statement by Ms. Miranda Xafa on Greece
Executive Board Meeting
July 26, 2009
I would like to express my authorities’ appreciation to Mr. Traa and his team for the fruitful
discussions they held during the 2009 Article IV consultation. The authorities consider that
the report prepared by the staff accurately identifies the main economic issues and policy
priorities. They agree with the staff’s view that restoring fiscal balance and strengthening
competitiveness are the key challenges ahead. However, they wish to highlight some points
that might have deserved more attention in the staff report, including the government’s
strategy for dealing with the crisis.
Impact of the Crisis
The deepening global downturn has affected the Greek economy substantially. After years of
strong growth averaging 4 percent, real GDP is now expected to be flat this year and to
recover only modestly in 2010, with the risks tilted to the downside. This performance
largely reflects the sharp deterioration in global economic and financial conditions that led to
a decline in Greece’s exports and a worsening in external financing conditions. However, the
global crisis also brought to the surface the structural weaknesses of the Greek economy.
During the upswing, rapid growth helped achieve near-convergence of per capita incomes
with the EU–27 average. Externally-funded credit growth raised outstanding credit to the
private sector relative to GDP closer to the level prevailing in the Euro-area. But the benign
global environment, characterized by strong external demand and low interest rates, masked
a deterioration in competitiveness and an increase in both public and external debt.
The global financial crisis adversely affected market sentiment and caused credit spreads to
widen sharply. Adverse debt dynamics leave no room for countercyclical policies to soften
the growth adjustment. Instead, they call for corrective action to reverse the rise in debt and
the erosion of competitiveness in order to lay the foundations for sustainable growth. The
crisis has thus made it more urgent to address outstanding structural issues—fiscal
consolidation and competitiveness. As discussed below, significant adjustment in fiscal
trends and labor costs is already underway. The balance sheets of banks, corporations, and
households are generally in good shape, and asset bubbles have been avoided. The
underlying health of the financial system is a positive factor supporting a gradual recovery in
domestic demand.
My authorities do not share the staff’s assessment of tail risks. Fiscal consolidation is
underway, and borrowing spreads have been easing, only partly reflecting global factors, to
less than half of their peak level in early 2009. The government has completed its funding for
the year, has raised an additional €8 billion to serve as a cushion, and faces a refinancing
need next year that is just over half of that in 2009.

2

Signs of a reduction in external imbalances are already apparent. Despite a sharp drop in
exports, the current account deficit narrowed to an annualized rate of 12 percent of GDP in
January–May 2009 from 16 percent in the same period of 2008 as imports of goods and
services fell by 26 percent. There are also signs that external competitiveness is improving in
response to the wage freeze in the central government and restrained wage behavior in the
private sector. This process is likely to accelerate, given favorable developments in relative
labor costs. Eurostat data indicate a decline in nominal hourly costs of 3.3 percent in
2009:Q1 from the same quarter of the previous year, compared to an increase of 3.7 percent
in the Euro area. Despite high wage growth under the 2008–09 collective agreement,
companies have been lowering labor costs informally and rapidly through reduced overtime
and unpaid days off. Going forward, wage restraint in the public sector is expected to be
emulated by the private sector, supporting the efforts to strengthen the competitiveness of the
Greek economy.
Fiscal Policy
Greece entered the downturn with a deficit of 5 percent of GDP in 2008 and a public debt
ratio approaching 100 of GDP. The 2009 target of a general government deficit of
3.7 percent of GDP therefore implied a substantial consolidation in structural terms. With
economic activity slowing more than anticipated in 2009, the general government deficit
target would have been missed in the absence of fiscal consolidation measures, which needed
to be tuned to political and economic realities. The authorities have formulated the following
strategy for confronting these challenges: In the short run, the strategy aims to contain the
mounting fiscal pressures while protecting the most vulnerable social groups and avoiding a
more pronounced slowdown. Beyond 2009, the strategy aims to pursue further fiscal
consolidation and structural fiscal reforms that will place the debt-to-GDP ratio firmly on a
downward path and correct the external imbalance.
To help curb the deficit, the government announced in March a freeze on government wages
and pensions in 2009 (with lower-paid workers and pensioners receiving a one-off payment
of up to €500) and a one-off levy on high-income earners. Additional measures expected to
yield 1 percent of GDP in the remainder of the year (1.4 percent of GDP on an annualized
basis) were announced on June 25, following the European parliamentary elections. These
measures, which largely offset the operation of automatic stabilizers, were difficult to take in
the context of a deteriorating economy and a tense political environment. Even so, there is a
risk that the general government deficit in 2009 could exceed the 3.7 percent of GDP target,
which was based on a better economic outlook than is now envisaged.
As detailed in the staff supplement, the June package consists largely of one-off revenue
measures that will have an immediate impact on the deficit. My authorities acknowledge that
one-off measures cannot substitute for fundamental reform needed to address the sources of

the excessive deficit. To this end, they are preparing a package of measures of a longer-term
structural nature, to be announced this fall in the context of the 2010 budget. These would
consist of high-quality consolidation measures focusing on the main sources of fiscal
pressures: the public sector wage bill, and the deficits of the social security funds, public
enterprises, and hospitals. The authorities have already begun to exercise more effective
control over the finances of local governments, hospitals, and state entities, facilitated by the
ongoing move to double-entry book-keeping and online mechanisms for cross-checking and
auditing. The administrative reform of the social security funds concluded in 2008 could also
result in considerable savings when fully implemented.
Financial Sector
Greek banks were not exposed to toxic structured products and their reliance on wholesale
funding was manageable, given their large deposit base and access to ECB funding.
Although banks were well capitalized and liquid, credit risk increased and asset quality
deteriorated in the context of a weaker economic environment, with fragilities also stemming
from exposure to Southeastern Europe. The authorities acted preemptively and implemented
a bank support package amounting to €28 billion (11 percent of GDP) in late 2008 consisting
of capital injections, liquidity support and funding guarantees. Stress tests conducted jointly
by the Bank of Greece and Fund staff have concluded that the banking system as a whole has
sufficient capital buffers to weather the recession, although some institutions were found to
need additional capital under some stress scenarios. The Bank of Greece thus took preventive
steps to ensure that banks’ capital positions are robust and provisioning remains adequate.
Greek banks received a €4 billion capital injection through the bank support package and
raised an additional €2 billion from the market so far this year. Several banks also have been
able to issue unsecured loans at spreads significantly lower than in the recent past.
In the inaugural issue of its Financial Stability Report in late June, the Bank of Greece notes
that the impact of the global crisis on the Greek banking sector, though significant, was
milder than elsewhere in the Euro area. The exposure of Greek banks to credit and liquidity
risk increased and capital adequacy declined but stayed above statutory limits as the crisis
deepened in late 2008. In line with supervisory expectations, these negative trends continued
into the first quarter of 2009, with NPLs rising to 6 percent, causing the provisions-to-NPL
ratio to fall to 44 percent. Although this ratio does not take into account the sizeable
guarantees and collateral held by Greek banks, its steady decline across all categories of
loans points to the need for continued vigilance. Overall, however, the capital and liquidity
buffers of the Greek banking sector remain fundamentally sound and continue to provide a
satisfactory margin of safety to cover risks and ensure financial stability.
