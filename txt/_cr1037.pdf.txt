December 28, 2009

Consultation and Team. The 2009 Article IV consultation discussions with Mauritius
were held in Port Louis October 19–31, 2009. The staff team comprised Mr. Ghosh
(Head, RES), Mr. Köhler, Mr. Samake (both AFR), Mr. Tsangarides (RES), and
Mr. Bastos (World Bank). The team met with Prime Minister, the Hon. Navinchandra
Ramgoolam; the Minister of Finance and Economic Empowerment, Hon. Rama
Sithanen; Central Bank Governor Rundheersing Bheenick; other senior government
officials; representatives of the private sector; and the leader of the opposition.
2008 Article IV Consultation. Directors welcomed the revival of the Mauritian
economy, spurred by the tax and business environment reforms adopted since 2006 that
have helped reduce fiscal deficits and attract foreign direct investment. They
encouraged the authorities to take steps to enhance labor market flexibility and improve
the coverage and reliability of national statistics.
Policies. Mauritius has suffered from the fallout of the global financial crisis. The
authorities’ response was commendably prompt and comprehensive, including a
temporary stimulus package of some 5 percent of GDP over the period July 2009–
December 2010. Monetary policy was also loosened; the key repo rate was cut by
250 b.p. and reserve requirements were reduced. A set of temporary and targeted
measures were directed at job preservation. The banking system remains robust and has
proved resilient. Structural reforms since 2006 have progressed well, but challenges
remain.
Exchange rate system. Mauritius has accepted the obligations of Article VIII,
Sections 2, 3, and 4. It maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on the making
of payments and transfers for current international transactions.
Two working papers, on monetary policy transmission mechanism and balance sheet
analysis for Mauritius, will be issued as companion papers to this report.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Economic growth has slowed sharply in the wake of the global financial crisis, but is
expected to rebound next year. Output growth slowed from 4.2 per year percent in 2008 to
less than 2 percent in 2009 as key drivers of growth (tourism, textiles, and construction)
contracted. Mauritius’ growth prospects depend heavily on the global economy, especially
the EU. Inflation has fallen to the low single digits as a result of lower global food and
commodity prices and the slowdown of the domestic economy. The current account deficit
has narrowed as lower imports have more than offset the contraction of external demand.
The authorities’ policy response was commendably prompt and comprehensive,
including a fiscal stimulus package of some 5 percent of GDP over the period July 2009–
December 2010. The package is well-targeted and temporary, intended to cushion the
economy against the impact of the crisis. The government was prescient in having saved some
3 percent of GDP in special funds for such a rainy day. For its post-crisis strategy, the key
challenge will be to resume fiscal consolidation without jeopardizing the recovery. Given the
uncertain outlook, the government has rightly decided to keep some stimulus measures
contingent; the 2010 deficit is now expected to be 4½ percent of GDP.
Further fiscal consolidation is important to reduce risks inherent to a relatively high
level of public debt. DSAs show that public and external debt should remain sustainable
over the medium term. The 2008 Public Debt Management Act will serve to instill fiscal
discipline and help ensure debt remains sustainable.
With inflationary pressures subdued, and the economic outlook uncertain, the
monetary policy stance appears appropriate. In the wake of the crisis, the Monetary
Policy Committee of the Bank of Mauritius (BoM) reduced the key Repo rate to 5.75 percent
per year in successive steps and has kept it unchanged over the past few months pending
further indication of the state of the economy. The BoM has refrained from intervention since
December 2008, and the floating exchange rate has remained stable against the U.S. dollar.
The Mauritian banking system has withstood the impact of the global financial turmoil.
Banks’ conservative business practices, their strong initial balance sheets, and the “Mauritius
Approach”—providing temporary financial relief to firms hit by the crises—have kept the
financial system sound. Capital adequacy, liquidity, and profitability of the banking system
remain sound, and the system appears resilient.
Measures to enhance efficiency in the public sector and to meet SDDS subscription
requirements are well under way. Labor market reforms have been enacted, and service
delivery and efficiency of the public sector is improving, especially in regard to social
protection. The authorities are on track to improve the coverage of external statistics and to
apply for SDDS subscription by mid-2010.
The authorities broadly agreed with the staff’s assessment and recommendations.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Mauritius has achieved remarkable success since its independence in 1968, with
one of the highest per capita incomes in Africa. Underpinning this performance have been
macroeconomic and political stability, robust institutions, an efficient administration, a
favorable regulatory environment, and a well-developed financial system. 1 In 2005, facing
major external shocks (the phasing out of the Multi-Fiber Agreement and sharp reductions in
EU sugar protocol prices), the government embarked on wide-ranging reforms that earned
Mauritius the title of “best place to do business in Africa” from the World Bank in 2008 and
2009. Structural measures (Box 1) were accompanied by efforts to strengthen monetary and
fiscal policy. 2

Like other emerging market economies (EMEs), Mauritius is now contending
with the fallout of the global financial crisis—notably, the decline in demand for tourism
and textile exports. The authorities have responded with a comprehensive policy package that
includes fiscal stimulus, monetary easing, ensuring foreign exchange (FX) liquidity,

Including a 15 percent flat tax rate, establishment of a central revenue authority, adoption of a fiscal
consolidation strategy anchored in budgetary reforms (supported by Fund technical assistance), and a public
debt law that stipulates reducing public debt to 50 percent of GDP by 2013 from its peak of 80 percent in 2003.

II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
4.
Output growth has slowed sharply in the wake of the global financial crisis, but
is expected to remain positive at about 2 percent in 2009. Growth slowed from 6.6 percent
in 2008H1 to 1.5 percent in 2009H1 as tourism, textiles, and construction contracted—
though financial services remain resilient. Contraction of these labor-intensive sectors has
increased the unemployment rate by about 1 percentage point, to almost 8 percent in 2009Q2,
with women (mainly in the textiles sector) particularly affected.

3

These steps are very much in line with staff policy advice to EMEs; see Coping with the Crisis: Policy
Options for Emerging Market Economies (SPN/09/08).

Inflation has subsided to
the low single digits (Figure 2).
Since reversal of last year’s global

and the slowdown of the domestic
economy and portfolio inflows,

by reduced imports. Export
volumes in the first half of 2009 contracted by 3.6 percent compared to the same period in
2008 and are forecast to fall by 11.6 percent in 2009, and import volumes are expected to fall
by 12.8 percent. The current account deficit is therefore expected to narrow by 2.3 percent of
GDP. While FDI continues to finance a substantial portion of the current account deficit, it
has declined by about 9½ percent in the first half of 2009 compared to the same period in
2008, and net private capital flows are expected to fall from 9 percent of GDP in 2008 to
about 7 percent in 2009.
7.
The exchange rate has depreciated modestly and reserves coverage remains
comfortable. Within the floating regime, the Bank of Mauritius (BoM) accumulated reserves
opportunistically through mid-2008 then allowed them to decline as capital inflows eased late
last summer (Figure 3). This trend continued when, in step with international developments,
monetary policy was eased in November and again in early December. The BoM has since
refrained from interventions, and the floating exchange has depreciated in nominal effective
terms by about 4 percent since January 2009, while remaining relatively stable against the
U.S. dollar. 5

4

Econometric decomposition of the change in inflation during the first two quarters of 2009 suggests that about
25 percent of the change is attributable to external factors (oil prices, global demand); 34 percent to monetary
conditions (changes in the repo rate and money demand); and 14 percent due to domestic factors (GDP growth
slowdown).

5

Mauritius’ exchange rate regime has been reclassified from a managed float to a free float in the Fund’s
AREAR.

Response to the Global Financial Crisis
8.
A fiscal stimulus package of about 5 percent of GDP (spread over 2009-10) was a
key element of the policy response. Rough calculations suggest that, inclusive of this
package, the fiscal impulse in FY2009/10 will be about 1.5 percent of GDP, commensurate
with an estimated output gap of about 1 percent of GDP (Text Table 1). 6 The targeted and
temporary stimulus measures focus on advancing planned infrastructure spending, providing
financial relief to the firms hit hardest by the global crisis, and protecting people either
through job preservation interventions or direct assistance to the most vulnerable. At the
same time, to ensure fiscal discipline and anchor expectations, the government also
introduced partially offsetting measures that are expected to bring the primary budget into
surplus by the end of 2011. The government has also been using special “rainy day” funds it
had prudently put aside in previous financial years (to the tune of 3 percent of GDP),
reducing current debt financing needs. In addition, a public debt management act was passed
limiting public sector debt to 60 percent of GDP, with a goal of reducing it to 50 percent by
2013.

Cross-country evidence suggests fiscal multipliers of about 0.5 for small, open economies; see Fiscal
Multipliers, SPN/09/11.

Monetary policy was
loosened in tandem. With the
economic slowdown and sharp
decline in the growth of private
sector credit, the BoM reduced its
policy rate by 250 basis points to
5.75 percent a year and lowered
reserve requirements (Figure 4). To
ensure FX liquidity while conserving
reserves, the BoM made FX credit
available to banks facing rollover
problems on FX liabilities, though in
the event, only one needed to avail
itself of this facility, and in a small
amount.

To facilitate debt restructuring and avoid inefficient insolvencies, the
government instituted the “Mauritius approach.” 7 This provides temporary financial
relief to firms facing liquidity problems due to the crisis, conditional on credible restructuring
plans, with costs shared by the banks, the government, and the firm’s shareholders. Other
initiatives to save jobs were a work-cum-training scheme that gave manufacturing and
tourism firms an alternative to laying off workers by partially reimbursing wages while
workers receive training. A few tax relief and deferrals were also provided to labor-intensive
and vulnerable sectors. These timely and temporary measures (most sunset in December
2010) are judged to have had a significant impact in containing unemployment.
III. OUTLOOK AND RISKS
11.
The short-term risks and external vulnerabilities of Mauritius appear
manageable. The exchange rate is estimated to be broadly in line with fundamentals, and
external debt appears sustainable, 8 including in the face of the DSA templates’ standard
shocks. Nevertheless, the current account deficit remains large—although the deficit is likely
overestimated (see DSA appendix), and about one-half is financed by FDI (which has
remained largely resilient even in the current crisis)—and accordingly poses some inherent
financing risk. As of October 2009, official reserves stood at about 6 months of merchandise
imports, 22 percent of GDP (twice the size of reported external debt), and about 10 percent of
broad money—comfortable coverage for a country with a flexible exchange rate. 9

7

This “Mauritius Approach”—also known as the Mauritian Transitional Support to the Private Sector
(MTSP)—is based on burden sharing amongst shareholders, management, creditors, and government. To date,
11 companies have received assistance under the MTSP, to which the government has contributed Rs140
million (36 percent of the total MTSP support for these companies; the rest has been provided by banks and
share holder equity) in the form of debentures at 5 percent interest. During the MTSP support, the companies’
management may be subject to cuts in salary and benefits and no dividends are paid until the government has
redeemed its investment. In regard to the fiscal cost of the program, the authorities estimate that the net present
value (NPV) should be zero, and only if some assisted companies fail would the NPV may be negative. All
firms assisted so far are doing well, with tight monitoring by the banks and authorities reducing risks to the
government budget.

8

The three CGER-type methodologies yield estimated overvaluations of 1.9 percent for the macroeconomic
balance approach (MB), 5.5 for the equilibrium real exchange rate (ERER) approach, and 5.7 for the external
sustainability approach (ES)—insignificantly different from zero, given the standard errors of the analysis. For
the MB approach, at end-2009 the CA norm is estimated—using CGER coefficients—at 4.7 percent. Using a
variety of estimates, the underlying CA is below the CA norm by 1.0—3.4 percent of GDP (1.5 percent for the
“baseline” underlying CA). Given the estimated elasticity of the current account response to the exchange rate,
these estimates suggest a small exchange rate overvaluation of 1.2—4.0 percent (1.9 percent for the “baseline”
underlying CA).
9

Including the general and special SDR allocations (SDR 75.3m, and SDR 5.7m) that the authorities intend to
hold as reserves (Table 3).

11
12.
Though exposed to the slowdown, banks remain well-capitalized and seem
resilient to further shocks. They were not holding toxic assets and, especially the large
banks that account for more than 70 percent of deposits, remain liquid and well-capitalized
despite some increase in nonperforming loans. Because banks hold long FX positions, they
would not be adversely affected by a further depreciation of the exchange rate (Box 2).
13.
Over the longer term, Mauritius’ growth prospects depend heavily on the global
economy. The medium-term growth forecast remains benign, but there is significant
uncertainty. Economic growth is projected to increase to 5 percent per year by 2011,
reflecting a reversal of the growth contraction in the EU, Mauritius’ main market for exports
and tourism. But further deterioration of the external accounts cannot be ruled out if global
demand remains sluggish and capital inflows dry up. And if world demand does begin to pick
up too rapidly, there is a risk that a surge in oil prices could more than offset a rebound in
demand for Mauritian exports, causing a deterioration of the trade deficit, larger financing
requirements, and inflationary pressures.
14.
To support the country’s transition from a low-skill sugar and apparel exporter
to an innovative and skill-based services economy, the government needs to continue its
ambitious reform agenda. In recent years, the government has revamped regulation,
especially with regard to labor, solvency, public debt management, and procurement
legislation (see Box 1). But although labor productivity has increased, transferring resources
from low- to high-productivity sectors faster is necessary to speed enhancement of overall
productivity. The human capital constraint needs to be addressed through a mix of long-run
initiatives to improve educational performance and short-term measures to mitigate labor
shortages in specific sectors and occupations.
15.
New labor market legislation should facilitate the economic transformation
underway. A new Employment Rights Bill that went into effect in 2009 contains workfare
provisions and introduces a “flexi-security” scheme as part of the broader reform of the
Industrial Relations Framework, which dated from 1973. The objective of flexi-security is to
shift protection from jobs to workers by providing transitional support to those that lose their
jobs. 10 This should lower resistance to structural change and stabilize incomes for
households, allowing for greater labor market efficiency and productivity-enhancing labor
reallocation.

10

The scheme provides for up to 12 months of transitional assistance to workers who opt to join the program.
Workers receive a stipend of 90 percent of the basic wage for the first three months, 60 percent for the second
three, and 30 percent for the six after that. In return workers must choose one of three programs offered by the
government: (i) job placement; (ii) training and retooling; or (iii) assistance in starting a small business.

12
Box 2. Financial Sector Stability
Despite the slowdown, the Mauritian banking system has thus far withstood the impact of the global financial
turmoil, for a number of reasons:
•

Banks were not holding toxic assets and fund operations mainly through domestic deposits (two-thirds
of total liabilities) rather than large-scale interbank foreign borrowing.

•

A sizable share (one-third) of total deposits is held in liquid or near-liquid assets.

•

Banks have limited exposure to equities, either by way of their own investments or as loan collateral.

•

The “Mauritius Approach” has helped avoid costly insolvencies.

•

Their positive net foreign exchange FX position contains banks direct exchange rate risk, and limiting
FX-denominated lending mainly to export-oriented enterprises contains credit risk.

The capital adequacy, liquidity, and profitability of the system are sound. Moreover, in line with the revised
Guideline on Credit Concentration Risk, the ratio of large exposures to capital had declined from 394 at the end
of 2008 to 215 by June 2009. Furthermore, bank assets have continued to improve since 2007, although
nonperforming loans (NPLs) inched up from 2 percent in 2008 to 2.6 percent at the end of June 2009.
Stress tests show that banks would be generally resilient to a range of adverse shocks but are vulnerable to
credit quality. On sensitivity to sector-specific credit shocks, a credit shock to sugar and textiles (with an
immediate loss of 20 percent each) leads to a deterioration of the Capital Asset Ratio (CAR) from 16.2 percent
to 12.3 percent and the NPLs (to total gross loans) from 2.3 percent to 5.8 percent. As in the 2007 Financial
Sector Assessment Program (FSAP), the impact of a 50 percent loss on each bank’s third largest exposure was
simulated; this leads to a deterioration of CAR from 16.3 percent to 14.7 percent and of NPLs from 2.3 percent
to 6.2 percent.
Much progress has been made since the 2007 FSAP update, among them work on the recommendations of the
2007 Basel Core Principles (BCP) assessment, which has already triggered significant reinforcement of banking
supervision. For instance, the position of head of the Supervision Division (SD), vacant for the past nine years,
has been filled, and the SD has been reorganized to improve its efficiency (it now includes the following
divisions: Off-site, On-site and Regulation, and Policy and Licensing). Remaining recommendations of the
2007 FSAP and the 2007 BCP assessment, which are mostly on completion or testing phases, are expected by
early 2010; more specifically: (i) a model for risk based supervision has been developed and is being applied
on a pilot basis to some banks; (ii) a draft Guideline on BOM intervention is in place; (iii) the final revision of
Guideline on liquidity has been issued; (iv) the Guideline on Corporate Governance is being issued; (v) Draft
Guideline on country risk has been issued. In addition, substantial progress has been made on the revision of
Guidelines on Related Party Transactions and credit concentration and the revision of the guideline on
Operational Risk. However, further steps are needed on the completion of the Supervision Manual.

IV. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
Discussions centered on the fiscal stance and ensuring sustainability of the public finances;
monetary policy, and the monetary and exchange rate policy regime; maintaining the
momentum of structural reforms; and improving the coverage of external statistics.
A. Fiscal Policy and Public Debt Sustainability
16.
While agreeing with the accommodative fiscal stance, the mission recommended
that some stimulus measures be held contingently in reserve and deployed only if the
recovery seems to be faltering—given the uncertain outlook and the challenge of resuming
fiscal consolidation without jeopardizing the recovery. Over short term, the government
intends to continue its expansionary fiscal policy through the next full fiscal year (JanuaryDecember 2010; Box 3). The authorities agreed, however, that if the recovery is stronger
than expected, the need for further stimulus would be correspondingly lower. Indeed, with
some early positive signs of recovery, the 2010 deficit is expected to be 4½ percent of GDP
rather than of the originally slated 5 percent. 11 The authorities explained that several of the
stimulus measures (especially support to enterprises and work-cum-training schemes) are in
the nature of automatic stabilizers. Moreover, a substantial part of the stimulus package
consists of bringing forward public infrastructure investment projects; these can be delayed if
the economy seems to be overheating and, in any case, the full program is unlikely to be
implemented. The deficit is expected to fall to below 4 percent in 2011 and about 3 percent
of GDP in 2012.
17.
The mission welcomed the new public debt law, which should strengthen fiscal
discipline and help ensure medium-term sustainability.12 Although immediate financing
risks appear limited, reducing public debt will create fiscal space against contingencies 13 and
the eventual costs of an aging population. The mission and the authorities agreed, however,
that the debt law as currently formulated may overly constrain the phasing of external
financing that the government may obtain and also infrastructure investment undertaken by
11

The borrowing requirement will be limited to 4 percent of GDP including through the sale of Mauritius
Telecom shares. On taxes, the government will not increase the VAT and will maintain various tax suspensions
in the tourism, construction, and real estate sectors until the end of 2010.
12

Although Mauritius’s public debt is high relative to most emerging market countries (close to 60 percent of
GDP compared to an average of 50 percent of GDP for non-fuel exporting EMEs), its vulnerability is limited in
part because it is nearly all held domestically by the National Pension Fund and commercial banks. Moreover,
appetite for treasury bills remains strong; indeed, one concern of banks is that the government will reduce the
domestic financing of its budget. Nonetheless, reducing public debt is important, for which grant support from
development partners (including, e.g., continued support from the EC V-FLEX) would be particularly useful.
13

Sensitivity analysis suggests that fiscal risk factors (e.g., lower revenues) are in the order of 0.5 to 0.6 percent
of GDP.

14
public enterprises, which is critically needed to enhance productivity. Specifically, the law
makes no provision for netting uncommitted and freely usable government deposits in the
banking system. In addition, nonguaranteed debt of public enterprises that are run on a
commercial basis and are not likely to rely on the government budget could be excluded from
public debt for the purposes of applying the debt limit. The guaranteed debt of such
enterprises could also be discounted, though this is more complicated because it requires an
explicit assessment of the likelihood that the guarantee could be called. The authorities
further agreed that any modification of the debt law should be done in line with best
practices, and not to undermine its critical value in maintaining fiscal discipline and
achieving the necessary medium-term consolidation. 14
18.
The mission welcomed the government’s efforts to secure external financing,
while underscoring that this financing should not widen the deficit, and that there are
limits to the substitutability between domestic and external financing. In the uncertain
external environment the government has prudently secured significant external financing of
about 7 percent of GDP from such sources as the African Development Bank and the World
Bank. The authorities recognize that the macroeconomic impact (either a significant increase
in base money or a sharp appreciation of the exchange rate) limits the substitutability
between domestic and external financing of the budget. 15 They intend to adopt a pragmatic
combination of using external financing to the extent it corresponds to capital imports for
public investment, limiting the substitution of domestic borrowing to what the market can
absorb, and treating part of the funds as precautionary—in effect, trying to reproduce a
contingent credit line (which might have better served their purposes). The authorities are
also considering creating a mini-sovereign wealth fund to park funds externally until they
might be needed.

While the BoM could issue securities to mop up the increase in liquidity, this would be equivalent to
domestic financing of the consolidated public sector in the first place—and would include a carry cost on the
interest differential.

15
Box 3. Mauritius: Fiscal Stimulus Measures for 2010
In the first half of 2009, the authorities began to implement the targeted and temporary stimulus
package announced in December 2008. The package accounts for about 5 percent of GDP, of which
3 to 3.5 percent of GDP will be carried out through dedicated funds that were set up at the end of the
2007/08 fiscal year as a contingency to deal with the crisis and were stocked up further in
FY2008/09. The Minister of Finance and Economic Empowerment announced in his budget speech
on November 18, 2009, that the following measures will be continued until December 2010:

•

Continue with direct support to SMEs and large enterprises facing temporary
difficulties due to the crisis, so as to protect jobs and enterprises.

•

Continue with the work-cum-training program for retrenched workers and the
unemployed.

•

Maintain the government’s commitment to upgrade public infrastructure in education,
health, the environment, and sports and to frontload public infrastructure projects to
boost construction and create jobs.

•

Accelerate private sector investment and improve competitiveness by modernizing
machinery and equipment and upgrading skills.

•

Continue various tax suspensions to the tourism, construction and real estate sectors
to stimulate growth and protect jobs.

•

On supporting development of Rodrigues island, (i) maintain additional infrastructure
development, (ii) suspend the travel tax to Rodrigues, and (iii) maintain the incentive
package for increasing tourism to Rodrigues.

•

Sustain a fiscal and monetary policy mix that is supportive of investment, growth, and
job creation.

•

Step up efforts to protect to the population and strengthen the Eradication of Absolute
Poverty Program.
B. Monetary Policy and Framework

19.
With inflationary pressures subdued and the economic outlook still uncertain,
the monetary policy stance appears appropriate. At its last two meetings of the Monetary
Policy Committee (MPC), against some initial positive signs from the textile and tourism
sectors, the MPC decided to leave the key Repo rate unchanged at 5.75 percent per year. The
mission considered that, in the current environment, with banks flush with liquidity, it is
unlikely that a further reduction in interest rates would significantly spur private lending and
activity; but the mission also stressed that the MPC needs to be vigilant against any
inflationary pressures. A more “data-driven” approach is therefore appropriate, with the MPC
holding the repo rate at its current level pending clearer indications of the state of the
economy.

16
20.
The monetary and exchange rate framework, which may be described as hybrid
inflation targeting, seems well-suited to the needs of the Mauritian economy. As a small
and highly open economy, the scope for monetary policy to be truly independent of external
factors is necessarily limited. In practice, policy interest rate decisions appear to place
significant weight on the interest rate differential relative to major currencies (e.g., the US
federal funds rate) while reacting to domestic inflation when it is above the tolerance level;
FX intervention is limited to smoothing operations, and no intervention has been undertaken
since November 2008 (Box 4). This allows the Mauritian monetary and exchange rate regime
to combine the flexibility of a floating exchange rate with some of the discipline of a less
flexible regime. The authorities agreed with this characterization of their monetary and
exchange rate regime and noted that they do not envisage moving soon to a pure IT
framework. The mission provided some background on common and best practices for the
functioning of MPCs and central bank governance structures.
Box 4: Monetary Policy Reaction Function
The BoM’s real policy interest rate reaction function can be described by:

Rt = β 0 + 0.03 ygap + 1.1 * * * D(π e − π ) + 0.4 * USFed t ; where R is the real policy (repo) rate,
USFed is the US federal funds rate, D is a dummy variable equal to unity when expected inflation
exceeds the threshold level, and the threshold (tolerance) level of inflation is estimated using maximum
likelihood methods to be 4.7 percent a year. From the uncovered interest rate parity condition, a high
coefficient on the Fed funds rate approximately sets the expected change of the exchange rate to zero
(as in a pegged exchange rate regime), but unexpected shocks can be absorbed by exchange rate
movements (as in a floating regime). Moreover, the high coefficient on expected inflation (when it
exceeds the tolerance level) implies that the policy reaction function obeys the Taylor principle.

21.
The currently low inflation rate may provide an opportunity for Mauritius to
adopt a more ambitious tolerance level for inflation. The MPC has been operating with an
implicit target (more precisely, tolerance level) for inflation of about 5 percent. Since
inflation is now considerably lower, a more ambitious tolerance level (perhaps 3 percent)

17
could be considered, with a view to anchoring inflationary expectations at this lower level. 16
The authorities agreed that this may be an opportune time to anchor low inflationary
expectations but also noted the need for further high-frequency indicators as well as
econometric modeling to better understand inflation dynamics. They stated that they very
much appreciate Fund technical assistance (TA), and the work of the mission, on
incorporating available high-frequency data and developing econometric models, and
requested that this assistance continue.
C. Financial Sector, Structural Reforms, and Data Coverage
22.
The mission welcomed the move towards greater risk-based financial sector
supervision and encouraged the speedy implementation of the remaining
recommendations of the 2007 FSAP. The authorities have made significant progress in
implementing the 2007 FSAP recommendations, including periodic compliance-based
analysis and steps to move toward more risk-based supervision; they agreed that remaining
aspects (risk-based supervision, supervision manual, guide on BoM intervention, and off-site
work) warrant speedy implementation. The government has requested Fund TA to help
design a deposit insurance scheme, as mandated by the BoM 2004 Act and the Banking Act.
This would give small, resident retail depositors more explicit assurance while clarifying that
the government would not be responsible for large, offshore/non-resident deposits.
23.
The mission welcomed efforts to improve service delivery and efficiency in the
public sector, particularly with regard to the social protection system. To achieve a
coherent approach in social policy, different agencies under the aegis of the Ministry of
Finance and Economic Empowerment (MOFEE) were integrated into a single organization,
the National Empowerment Foundation (NEF), set up in July 2008. 17 The range of
interventions includes training, placement, support for small and medium enterprises, direct
financial assistance to most vulnerable groups, and housing. Despite the consolidation, social
assistance in Mauritius needs further rationalization to target those that cannot escape poverty
and to empower people to exploit new labor market opportunities. This is crucial for assuring
that the 4.4 percent of GDP (2008/09 budget) spent on social assistance is used efficiently.
Other initiatives to improve service delivery and efficiency in the public sector (such as PMS
and parastatal reforms) are underway, including drawing on Fund and Bank TA.

16

Such a move is also facilitated by the change from centralized wage determination to collective bargaining at
the national level via the National Pay Council supplemented by flexibility in implementing recommendations
at the firm level. The NPC formula of half inflation plus productivity to guide wage setting should favor a low
inflation environment.
17

The NEF provides an overall coordinating framework for the Empowerment Program, the Trust Fund for the
Social Integration of Vulnerable Groups, the Eradication of Absolute Poverty Program, the Decentralized
Cooperation Program, the Program for Rodrigues and the Corporate Social Responsibility Program.

18
24.
The mission emphasized the need to resolve discrepancies in the balance of
payments (BOP) and to improve external statistics to meet SDDS requirements. A joint
committee comprising the BoM, Financial Services Commission (FSC) and MoFEE has been
established to conduct a BOP survey of resident GBCs managed by 12 major management
companies (MCs). 18 The objective of the survey is to enhance coverage of the BOP statistics
and the international investment position (IIP)—a critical requirement for subscription to the
SDDS. The mission also urged the BoM to reissue the Foreign Assets and Liabilities Survey
(FALS), which was first launched as an exploratory survey in November 2007 to collect data
from resident companies on their cross-border financial flows and stocks. The authorities
stated that they recognized the importance of improving the coverage of external statistics,
including understanding the large positive errors and omissions in the BOP statistics, and are
committed to doing so as soon as practicable; they expect to be ready to apply for
subscription to the SDDS by mid-2010.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
25.
The authorities’ prompt and comprehensive policy response has been
instrumental in cushioning the economy from the fallout of the global financial crisis.
Staff considers that the magnitude of the fiscal stimulus and extent of monetary easing to
have been appropriate to the external shock from the global financial crisis. Together with
more micro measures to restructure debts of illiquid enterprises and save private sector jobs,
the policy response has been instrumental in cushioning the economy from the crisis impact.
26.
The challenge now is how to begin withdrawing the stimulus and working
toward further fiscal consolidation without jeopardizing the recovery. Despite shocks
and the current crisis, public debt over the period 2006-2010 will be lower than in the
previous five years, and stochastic simulations suggest a strong likelihood of further declines
over the following five years. Nevertheless, public debt remains high and fiscal consolidation
will be important to reduce the inherent risks. In addition, fiscal consolidation will also help
reduce the large external current account deficit, which carries financing risks. Given
uncertain conditions, the authorities have rightly decided on some contingent stimulus
measures that will be deployed only if the recovery falters. Careful management of the mix
of external and domestic financing of public debt is also required. In the longer term, the
challenge will be to sustain reform efforts, enhance productivity, and improve the costeffectiveness of public sector service delivery.
27.
Mauritius remains vulnerable to global developments—but the private sector is
dynamic, economic fundamentals are strong, institutions are robust, and the authorities have

18

The first-round survey of GBCs is on track; the FSC sent the survey to the 12 MCs on September 25 with a
submission deadline of March 31, 2010.

19
not only implemented far-reaching reforms in an environment of continued macroeconomic
stability, they have also established a track record of strong policy responses to unexpected
shocks. Some further reduction in public debt levels, monetary policy refinements, financial
sector and structural reforms, and data improvements will both improve the economy’s
resilience and better position Mauritius to compete with other EMEs, including as a financial
center.
28.
Staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12month cycle.

APPENDIX. DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Assumptions
The macroeconomic projection assumes that the government will resume fiscal consolidation as
part of its post-crisis strategy and that growth will be higher, driven by rising foreign and domestic
investment, and supported by ongoing structural reforms to improve competitiveness. Assuming
no major negative shocks, GDP growth is expected to trend at 5 percent. The fiscal deficit will
continue to decline as fiscal consolidation is resumed and financial discipline on public enterprises
is better enforced. The primary balance, which was positive in 2007/08 and 2008/09, is projected
to be negative in 2009 and 2010 but turn positive again in the medium term. Public investment is
projected to rise to support higher growth.
Public Debt
In Mauritius the public finances are fundamentally sound and public debt is sustainable over the
medium-term; the new Public Debt Management Act provides additional safeguards. With the
launching of a wide-ranging reform strategy in 2005, the government has successfully
implemented program-based budgeting within a medium-term expenditure framework, and the
new debt law stipulates a reduction in public debt to 50 percent of GDP by 2013. Since fiscal
consolidation began in 2005, public debt has been reduced from a peak of over 80 percent of GDP
in 2003 to 54 percent in 2008. The forward-looking debt sustainability analysis (DSA) suggests
that public debt will remain sustainable over the medium term (Table 1). It incorporates the fiscal
stimulus measures, which are projected to push the deficit up to 4 percent of GDP in calendar 2009
and 4.5 percent in 2010 from about 3 percent in 2007 and 2008. Based on this scenario, public debt
peaks at slightly below 60 percent of GDP in 2009 before falling to 52 percent in 2014, the end of
the projection period. This adjustment is consistent with commitments under the Public Debt
Management Act, which limits public sector debt to 60 percent of GDP and targets a medium-term
reduction to 50 percent under “normal” circumstances. The results of standardized tests do not
alter the general assessment because no scenario raises the debt ratio above levels observed as
recently as 2004. Indeed, the only scenario in which debt exceeds the authorities’ own limit of 60
percent of GDP is when the primary deficit remains at its 2009 level over the full projection
horizon (2009-14; Table 1); however, the authorities do not intend to maintain the deficit at its
2009 level, which was relatively large due to the economic downturn and stimulus. The mediumterm scenario is also quite resilient to macroeconomic shocks: if growth were about 1 percent
lower than projected, the debt-to-GDP ratio would increase to 56 percent of GDP (Figure 1).

Stochastic simulation of public debt dynamics in Mauritius suggests that, on the baseline
projection for the primary balance (which incorporates the stimulus package), there is a strong

27
likelihood that the public debt ratio will at least stabilize, and may fall marginally, over the next
five years (Box 1).
External Debt
External debt is sustainable. Excluding short-term private sector liabilities, it stood at
13.4 percent of GDP at the end of 2009, down from 19.6 percent in 2002. Official estimates of
short-term private sector debt are only about 1 percent of GDP—almost surely it is underreported. A preliminary survey suggests that total short-term external liabilities of the nonfinancial
private sector are unlikely to be higher than 10 percent of GDP; an updated survey is planned for
the end of 2009. Gross bank external liabilities were about 100 percent of GDP at the end of July
2009 and are not included in external debt as bank foreign assets are almost twice as large, 1 and as
in many international financial centers, it would be misleading to include gross bank liabilities in
the external debt measure. 2 Including banks’ position on a net basis in external debt shows that the
net external debt position for the economy as a whole is generally balanced (Box 2). Projections
suggest that external debt will rise over the next few years before stabilizing at about 19 percent of
GDP, and debt dynamics remain stable in the face of DSA template shocks. 3

Bank investments of the GBC float—that is, money from foreign investors meant to be transferred to third countries
but held for a short period by GBCs in bank deposits—are included. Excluding these GBC counterpart investments
would still result in a positive bank net foreign asset position.

Historically, there are large positive errors and omissions in the balance of payments. These likely reflect, inter alia,
management fees earned by GBCs (which are not captured in the BOP statistics, which treat GBCs as nonresidents), as
well as, possibly, capital inflows. For the purposes of DSA projections, the authorities’ estimate of likely management
fees is included in the service receipts of the current account. Nevertheless, the projections likely overestimate the
increase in external debt, as the unaccounted errors and omissions are unlikely to be all debt-creating.

28
Box 1. Stochastic Debt Sustainability Analysis
Monte Carlo simulations of public debt dynamics around the baseline projection (using shocks based on the
estimated variance-covariance matrix of the primary balance, real GDP growth, and the real interest rate) yield a
declining debt ratio after 2010, with the mean of the distribution at about 50 percent of GDP by 2014
(marginally lower than the baseline projection of 52 percent with the 90 percent confidence interval of [41, 61];
see Figure). Endogenizing the primary balance to allow it to react to the level of public debt yields a statistically
significant regression coefficient of 0.1, implying that for each 10 percent of GDP that public debt increases, the
primary balance in Mauritius has, historically, improved by 1 percent of GDP. This compares favorably to
advanced economies (where the average coefficient is 0.02) and to other EMEs (where the average coefficient
is 0.04).1 Incorporating this primary balance reaction function yields a somewhat lower mean debt ratio of 48
percent of GDP by 2014 with the 90 percent confidence interval of [41, 56], which suggests that the primary
balance in the baseline projection is not implausible given Mauritius’ historical performance and its ongoing
fiscal reform efforts.

Box 2. Aggregate Balance Sheet of Mauritius Banks
As noted in the text, the DSA excludes bank foreign assets and foreign liabilities (following DSA policies for
financial centers), but does such an “outsized” banking system nevertheless pose risks?
Structure of the banking system. The Mauritius banking system is dominated by two long-established domestic
(MCB and SBM) and two international banking groups (Barclays and HSBC). Of the 18 commercial banks,
four large banks serve both the domestic and foreign market, three large foreign banks serve almost exclusively
nonresidents, five small and medium banks are focused on nonresidents, but pay increasing attention to the
domestic market; the remainder largely serve the domestic market.
Foreign exchange (FX) versus foreign assets and liabilities. FX liabilities are about 121 percent of GDP and
FX assets are 172 percent. Of the latter, 153 percent of GDP represent claims on nonresidents (of which
58 percent of GDP—equivalent to almost one-half of FX liabilities—are simply held as balances in banks
abroad). FX lending to residents is only 19 percent of GDP (of which 6 percent of GDP is to the GBCs), and
many residents have foreign currency earnings (e.g., the tourist sector). Foreign liabilities are much smaller than
FX liabilities because the GBCs are considered residents in the monetary statistics. Liabilities to (the deposits
of) the GBCs are funds that originate from foreign investors (who wish to invest, e.g., in India) and are
temporarily parked in Mauritian banks before transfer abroad. These deposit floats, though flowing through
Mauritian banks, are quite stable in aggregate, amounting to some 72 percent of GDP, virtually all in FX, and
providing useful short-term FX liquidity to the banking system. FX liabilities to other residents (34 percent of
GDP) likely reflect retail deposits of foreign currency earners (e.g., the tourist trade), and nonresident liabilities
likely include regional depositors seeking to benefit from the country’s financial and political stability.
Risks. The large net foreign asset position (equal to 109 percent of GDP, or 44 percent of GDP if the GBCs are
considered non-residents), the long FX position, the large proportion of FX assets held as highly liquid bank
deposits abroad, and the limited FX lending to residents all give comfort that the risks should be manageable.
Nevertheless, given the sheer magnitudes, close vigilance is warranted.1/

1/ Indicate coverage of public sector, e.g., general government or nonfinancial public sector. Also whether net or gross debt is used.
2/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + αε(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; α = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and ε = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as αε(1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

ε = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and α = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock.
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels
of the last projection year.

X. Exchange Rate Arrangement
At the time of the 2008 Article IV consultations, Mauritius was classified as a managed float
exchange rate regime with interventions aimed at smoothening volatility rather than altering
the trend. Reflecting the lack of intervention since December 2008, Mauritius’ exchange rate
regime was reclassified from a managed float to a free float in the Fund’s 2009 Annual Report
on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions. The exchange arrangement is free of
multiple currency practices and restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for
current international transactions. Mauritius accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Section
2(a), 3, and 4 on September 29, 1993. Mauritius also maintains a liberal capital account. On
December 15, 2009, the US$1 was equivalent to MUR 28.84.
XI. Article IV Consultation
Mauritius is on the standard 12-month cycle. The last Article IV consultation staff report
(Country Report No. 08/238, June 2008) was considered by the Executive Board on July 2,
2008. A Financial System Stability Assessment update was completed by a joint IMF–World
Bank team on April 20, 2007.

to deal with (i) short-term trade shocks and (ii) the
transition to a more competitive and diversified
economy, while minimizing negative social impacts
along the transition. Because the Country Partnership
Strategy sets out a broad program, specific activities
are determined every year through the Annual
Business Plan meeting held jointly with the
Government and Development Partners.

Appendix III. Relations with the African Development Bank Group
(As of December 1, 2009)
Assistance from the African Development Bank (ADB) to Mauritius combines lending and
non-lending activities. Lending has focused on infrastructure development in agriculture and
transportation and non-lending on economic and sector work (ESW) in health, poverty
reduction, and debt management. Under the NEPAD Program, ADB has collaborated with
the UNDP, AU, and ECA on the African Peer Review Mechanism (APRM), for which
Mauritius is one of the four pilot cases. An ADB study on poverty, gender, and social
exclusion is also under preparation and is being coordinated with the EU and the UNDP,
while there are studies by the ADB concerning health and sanitation. Past collaboration with
the World Bank (and other partners) includes water, sewerage, and sanitation (the Plaines
Wilhems Sewerage Project) and transport (Southeastern Highway). A close working
relationship has developed between the two institutions during the preparation and appraisal
of the first and second Development Policy Loans.

Appendix IV. Statistical Issues

MAURITIUS—STATISTICAL I SSUES APPENDIX
As of December 15, 2009
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is adequate for surveillance. However, balance of payments (BOP)
and international investment position (IIP) statistics could be improved to meet SDDS
requirements. The authorities are aware of this situation and are continuing work in this regard.
Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Statistics: Coverage and
accuracy of BOP and IIP statistics has diminished as a consequence of the liberalization and
the growth of global business license holders. Notably, there has been an increase in net errors
and omissions in the BOP; while the IIP statistics tend to undercount international liabilities as
transactions of offshore financial institutions with the rest of the world are only partially
covered. Both factors combine to increase the uncertainty associated with economic analysis of
the external sector.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Participant in the GDDS since September
2002. The authorities have a time-bound
action plan to improve coverage of BOP and
IIP statistics that, when completed, should
help them be in a position to subscribe to the
SDDS by about mid-2010.

A data ROSC report was published in August
2008.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
January 26, 2010

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Concludes 2009 Article IV Consultation with Mauritius
On January 13, 2010, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Mauritius. 1
Background
Economic growth has slowed sharply in the wake of the global financial crisis, but is
expected to rebound next year. Output growth slowed from 4.2 per year percent in 2008 to
less than 2 percent in 2009 as key drivers of growth (tourism, textiles, and construction)
contracted. Inflation has fallen to the low single digits as a result of lower global food and
commodity prices and the slowdown of the domestic economy. The current account deficit
has narrowed as lower imports have more than offset the contraction of external demand.
The authorities’ policy response was commendably prompt and comprehensive, including a
fiscal stimulus package of some 5 percent of GDP over the period July 2009-December
2010. The package is well-targeted and temporary, intended to cushion the economy
against the impact of the crisis. The government was prescient in having saved some
3 percent of GDP in special funds against such a rainy day. For its post-crisis strategy, the
key challenge will be to resume fiscal consolidation without jeopardizing the recovery. Given
the uncertain outlook, the government has rightly decided to keep some stimulus measures
contingent; the 2010 deficit is now expected to be 4½ percent of GDP. Further fiscal
consolidation of public debt is important to reduce risks inherent to a relatively high level of

1 Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return
to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive
Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board,
summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's
authorities. This PIN summarizes the views of the Executive Board as expressed during the
May 2008 Executive Board discussion based on the staff report.

2
public debt. Forward-looking debt sustainability analyses show that public and external debt
should remain sustainable over the medium term. The 2008 Public Debt Management Act
will serve to instill fiscal discipline and help ensure debt remains sustainable.
With inflationary pressures subdued, and the economic outlook uncertain, the monetary
policy stance appears appropriate. In the wake of the crisis, the Monetary Policy Committee
of the Bank of Mauritius (BoM) reduced the key Repo rate to 5.75 percent per year in
successive steps and has kept it unchanged over the past few months pending further
indication of the state of the economy. The BoM has refrained from intervention since
December 2008, and the floating exchange rate has remained stable against the U.S. dollar.
The Mauritian banking system has withstood the impact of the global financial turmoil.
Banks’ conservative business practices, their strong initial balance sheets, and the
“Mauritius Approach”—providing temporary financial relief to firms hit by the crises—have
kept the financial system sound. Capital adequacy, liquidity, and profitability of the banking
system remain sound, and the system appears resilient.
Measures to enhance efficiency in the public sector and to meet SDDS subscription
requirements are well under way. Labor market reforms have been enacted, and service
delivery and efficiency of the public sector is improving, especially in regard to social
protection. The authorities are on track to improve the coverage of external statistics and to
apply for SDDS subscription by mid-2010.
The medium-term growth forecast remains benign, but there is significant uncertainty
because Mauritius’ growth prospects depend heavily on the global economy. Economic
growth is projected to increase to 5 percent per year by 2011, reflecting a reversal of the
growth contraction in the EU, Mauritius’ main market for exports and tourism. But further
deterioration of the external accounts cannot be ruled out if global demand remains sluggish
and capital inflows dry up. And if world demand does begin to pick up too rapidly, there is a
risk that a surge in oil prices could more than offset a rebound in demand for Mauritian
exports, causing a deterioration of the trade deficit, larger financing requirements, and
inflationary pressures.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the Mauritian authorities for their prompt and
comprehensive policy response, which has been instrumental in cushioning the economy
from the fallout of the global financial crisis. The size of the targeted and temporary fiscal
stimulus package, and the extent of the monetary easing, were well-calibrated to the
magnitude of the external shock. Directors commended the authorities’ implementation of
far-reaching reforms in recent years and their track record of strong policy responses to
unexpected shocks.
Given the uncertain outlook, and the challenge of resuming fiscal consolidation without
jeopardizing the recovery, Directors supported the authorities’ decision to keep some
stimulus measures in reserve, to be deployed only if the economy falters. While agreeing on
the accommodative fiscal stance, Directors underscored that fiscal consolidation remains
important for reducing the vulnerabilities inherent in a still-relatively high level of public debt,
as well as for narrowing the current account deficit. Although immediate financing risks

3
appear limited, reducing public debt further will help create fiscal space for meeting
contingencies and the eventual costs of an aging population. In this context, Directors noted
that the recent public debt management law will strengthen fiscal discipline and help ensure
medium-term sustainability.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ efforts to secure external financing while underscoring
that this financing should not widen the deficit. They supported the authorities’ intention to
adopt a pragmatic combination of using external financing to the extent it corresponds to
capital imports for public investment, limiting the substitution of domestic borrowing to what
the market can absorb, and treating part of the external funds as precautionary.
Directors viewed the monetary and exchange rate framework as well-suited to the needs of
the Mauritian economy. They encouraged the authorities to take advantage of the currently
low inflationary pressures to help anchor inflationary expectations at a lower rate than
previously. In this vein, Directors supported the authorities’ intention to compile additional
high-frequency indicators as well as to further develop analytical tools to better understand
inflation dynamics and monetary policy transmission.
Directors noted that, despite the slowdown, the Mauritian banking system remains wellcapitalized and appears resilient. They welcomed the move towards greater risk-based
financial sector supervision and looked forward to the early implementation of the remaining
recommendations of the 2007 FSAP.
Directors supported the recent improvements in service delivery and efficiency in the public
sector, particularly with regard to the social protection system. They called for further efforts
to rationalize social assistance to target the poor and to empower people to seize new labor
market opportunities.
Directors considered that the key objectives for the medium term are to reduce further the
level of public debt, refine the monetary policy framework, and sustain financial sector and
structural reforms. Achieving these objectives would raise productivity, further improve the
economy’s resilience, and better position Mauritius to compete with other emerging market
economies, including as a financial center. Directors also supported the authorities’ efforts in
pressing forward with data improvements, including to the balance of payments, so as to
meet the SDDS requirements by mid-2010.
Directors welcomed the establishment of the new Fund regional technical assistance center,
AFRITAC South, in Mauritius.

Public Information Notices (PINs) are issued, (i) at the request of a member country, following the
conclusion of the Article IV consultation for countries seeking to make known the views of the IMF to the
public. This action is intended to strengthen IMF surveillance over the economic policies of member
countries by increasing the transparency of the IMF's assessment of these policies; and (ii) following
policy discussions in the Executive Board at the decision of the Board.

Statement by Laurean W. Rutayisire, Executive Director for Mauritius
January 13, 2010
I – Introduction
On behalf of my Mauritian authorities, I would like to express our appreciation to staff for
the constructive discussions on the Mauritian economy held during the last Article IV
consultation. My authorities are in broad agreement with staff analysis and policy
recommendations regarding the challenges facing the economy. They also thank staff for the
two working papers issued along side with the 2009 Article IV consultation report. In the
context of timely Fund’s technical assistance to Mauritius, my authorities value the
background provided by staff on common and best practices for the functioning of Monetary
Policy Committees and Central Banks’ governance structures.
In addition, my Mauritian authorities would like to express their deep appreciation to Fund
Management for its decision to locate AFRITAC South in Mauritius. They welcome this
decision, which honors Mauritius, and helps translate the IMF’s commitment to further
contribute to regional member countries’ efforts to improve their institutional and human
capacity.
My Mauritian authorities are grateful to Staff, Management and the Board for the continued
support to their efforts to implement far-reaching reforms initiated in 2006, with a view to
restructure the economy and find new drivers for a strong and sustained economic growth.
This support, together with the assistance from other partners, has helped Mauritius to earn
from the World Bank in 2008 and 2009 the title of the “best place to do business in Africa”.
II – Recent Macroeconomic Developments
The Mauritian economy has not been spared by the global economic slowdown over the past
two years in the wake of the financial crisis that erupted in 2007. The economic growth
slowed from 4.2 percent in 2008 to 1.5 percent in 2009, due to the contraction in the sectors
of tourism, textile and construction. The activity’s contraction in these sectors has led the
unemployment rate to reach 8 percent. Export and import volumes are expected to fall
respectively by 11.6 percent and 12.8 percent in 2009, mostly because of the economic
slowdown in the European Union, which is Mauritius’s main trading partner. The current
account deficit is expected to narrow by 2.3 percent, given the fact that external demand has
been more than offset by reduced imports. However, in sharp decline, FDI has substantially
financed the current account deficit. Inflation has fallen to low single digit in 2009, as a result
of the contraction of domestic activity and the decline in global food and commodities prices.
In order to overcome the adverse effects of the global crisis on the Mauritian economy, my
authorities have designed and implemented prompt and comprehensive policy measures
consisting largely of fiscal stimulus, monetary easing, providing foreign exchange liquidity,
strengthening the social safety net as well as measures to preserve jobs. The well-targeted
fiscal stimulus of about 5 percent of GDP and covering 2009-2010 has been instrumental in
helping the economy to weather the global crisis. In the context of the fiscal stimulus, my

2
authorities introduced measures to ensure fiscal discipline, with a view to bring the primary
budget into surplus by the end of 2011. In their efforts to reduce the current debt financing
needs, they have drawn funds from the special rainy day account established in previous
financial years. Moreover, they have passed a public debt management act limiting the public
sector debt to 60 percent of GDP with a goal of reaching 50 percent by 2013.
My Mauritian authorities are mindful of the uncertainties attached to the economic outlook,
given the heavy dependence of growth prospects on the recovery of the global economy.
They are also of the view that the key challenge under the post-crisis strategy is to resume
efforts towards fiscal consolidation together with economic recovery. Against this
background, they have decided to maintain some stimulus measures up to end of 2010. The
2008 Public debt management Act will facilitate resuming fiscal discipline and ensuring debt
sustainability. My authorities remain strongly committed to pursue their reform agenda, with
a view to transform the Mauritian economy into an innovative and skill-based services
economy.
III – Macroeconomic Policies and Reforms
Fiscal Policy
The authorities intend to pursue over the short-term accommodative fiscal stance, which
would be phased out as the economy recovers. In this regard, the fiscal stimulus put in place
will continue through 2010. The fiscal deficit is projected to be 4.5 percent in 2010 and
decline to 4 percent in 2011 and 3 percent in 2013. The framework created by the new
public debt law will help strengthen fiscal discipline and ensure medium-term sustainability.
Given the uncertainties related to the external environment and the need to pursue
infrastructure investment that is critical to further enhancing productivity, the authorities
have secured significant financing from donors, including the World Bank and the African
Development Bank equivalent to 7 percent of GDP. Mindful of the limits to the
substitutability between domestic and external financing of the budget, the authorities intend
to treat part of these funds as precautionary and will adopt a pragmatic approach in the use of
external financing. To this end, external financing will correspond to capital imports for
public investment and the substitution of domestic borrowing will be limited to what the
market could absorb.
Monetary Policy
In response to the economic slowdown due to the crisis, the authorities have implemented
bold and appropriate measures on the monetary front. These measures include the reduction
of the Central Bank’s policy rate by 250 basis points to 5.75 percent and the lowering of the
reserve requirements. Moreover, a foreign exchange credit facility was established to ensure
liquidity, while preserving reserves. Though the inflationary pressures are subdued, the
authorities remain vigilant, given the uncertainties of the global economic outlook and the
need to restore a sustained domestic economic activity. The repo rate will be kept at its
current level until there are clear indications that the external and domestic environments
have improved. With regard to inflation, my authorities concur with staff that the currently
low rate may be an opportunity to anchor low inflationary expectations. In this regard, they

3
request a technical assistance from the Fund to help develop appropriate econometric models.
The flexibility of the floating exchange rate regime has served the economy well. On the
move to a formal inflation targeting, the authorities are of the view that much needs to be
done, in order to meet the required conditions for such a move.
Financial Sector
The Mauritian financial sector has withstood the impact of the global financial turmoil, due
in particular to its strong initial balance sheets and the temporary financial relief measures
provided to firms hit by the crises. Capital adequacy, liquidity and profitability of the
banking system remain sound. Significant progress has been made since the 2007 FSAP
update. In this context, most of the recommendations of the 2007 Basel Core principles
assessment have been implemented. Moreover, the authorities have strengthened the banking
supervision, with a view to move towards greater risk-based financial sector supervision. In
this regard, the banking supervision has been restructured and most of the guidelines have
been revised. The authorities are committed to speed up their efforts to implement the
remaining recommendations of the 2007 FSAP. They have also requested a technical
assistance from the Fund to help design a deposit insurance scheme in compliance with the
Bank of Mauritius 2004 Act and the Banking Act.
Structural Reforms
Mauritius has made significant inroads in implementing the needed structural reforms to take
full opportunity of globalization, bolstering competitiveness, and encouraging the
diversification of the economy following the phasing out of trade preferences for textiles and
sugar. In this context, regulation related in particular to labor, solvency debt management and
procurement legislation has been revamped. A new Employment Rights Bill containing
workforce provisions and introducing a “flexi-security” scheme as part of the broader reform
of the Industrial Relations Framework is being implemented. This scheme aims at lowering
resistance to structural change and will help stabilize incomes for households to allow for
greater labor market efficiency.
While pursuing structural reforms and achieving a coherent approach in social security, the
authorities have made progress in improving the public sector’s efficiency. This approach
includes the establishment in July 2008 of a National Empowerment Foundation. Operating
under the aegis of the Ministry of Finance and Economic Empowerment, this Foundation
covers a wide range of interventions including training, placement, support for small and
medium-sized enterprises, and direct financial assistance to vulnerable groups and housing as
well. Under the Fund and World Bank assistance, the authorities intend to pursue parastatal
reforms to further improve delivery and efficiency in the public sector.
Improvement of External Statistics
The authorities remain strongly committed to improving the external statistics through
intensified efforts to resolve discrepancies in the balance of payments. A joint committee
made up of Bank of Mauritius, Financial Services Commissions and the Ministry of Finance
and Economic Empowerment has been established to conduct a survey of resident of Global

4
Business Companies with a view to enhance the coverage of BoP statistics and the
international investment position. In addition, the Mauritian authorities intend to apply for
subscription to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS), which will help strengthen
the Mauritius’ competitiveness.
IV – Conclusion
Policy measures implemented by the Mauritian authorities over the recent years have helped
to cushion the economy from the impact of the global financial turmoil. In order to maintain
a good track record and respond promptly to unexpected shocks, my authorities are mindful
of the need to pursue their reform agenda designed to further reduce public debt levels,
sustain the diversification of the economy, and improve its competitiveness. In this regard,
my authorities will continue to look for a closer relationship with the Fund to assist them in
their effort to better design and implement the appropriate policies to meet their ongoing
challenges.
