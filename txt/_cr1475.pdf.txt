THE BAHAMAS
STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
January 3, 2014

KEY ISSUES
Context. Economic activity remains tepid, unemployment is high, and inflation is
subdued. The fiscal and external positions have weakened, with reserves declining
toward worrisome levels. Non-performing loans (NPLs) are elevated, but the financial
system is well capitalized and liquid.
Focus of the consultation. Discussions focused on policies to secure fiscal, external, and
financial sector stability, and strengthen medium-term growth.
Policy recommendations and authorities’ views:


Contain rising central government debt through timely fiscal consolidation. The
authorities need to implement comprehensive policies to curb the central
government deficit and reduce debt to comfortable levels.



Enhance external stability and bolster growth potential. To improve the external
position and rebuild eroding reserves, the authorities should rigorously implement
fiscal consolidation and intensify efforts to diversify tourism and exports. Identified
structural impediments to growth should be removed expeditiously, with the
authorities’ comprehensive growth strategy finalized by the announced deadline of
late 2014.



Further strengthen financial supervision. Close monitoring of credit risks is
required in view of persistently elevated non-performing loans (NPLs); and financial
crisis prevention and resolution frameworks should be promptly strengthened.



The authorities broadly concurred with staff’s assessment and
recommendations. They especially recognized the urgent need for budget
consolidation and expressed commitment to timely implementation of underpinning
reforms, as well as to the finalization of a comprehensive economic diversification
and growth strategy.

Past surveillance. In concluding the 2012 Article IV consultation, Executive Directors
emphasized that The Bahamas’ key policy priority is to strengthen public finances,
improve competitiveness, and begin rebuilding the policy buffers eroded in the
aftermath of the 2008 crisis. Directors underscored the importance of measures to
improve the business environment, develop infrastructure, enhance human capital, and
promote economic diversification. They also welcomed the finding of the Financial
Sector Stability Assessment that there are no immediate threats to financial stability.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
Economic activity continues to recover from the global financial crisis, but at a slow pace. The fiscal
situation deteriorated in FY2012/13, mainly due to customs revenue underperformance. Reflecting
weak tourism receipts, the external current account deficit increased further, adding to pressures on
reserve adequacy. While private sector deleveraging continues, the financial sector appears sound.
1.
Growth remains tepid. Real GDP grew by 1.8 percent in 2012, similar to 2011, and well
below pre-global-crisis performance (Table 1 and Figure 1). Investment, led by construction of the
US$3.5 billion Baha Mar tourist resort project, grew by 20.6 percent, but private consumption
(70 percent of GDP) declined for the fifth consecutive year. Tourism receipts—the bulk of exports—
have been weaker than expected, partly reflecting Hurricane Sandy in late 2012 and early 2013, but
also owing to persistent softness in the high value-added stopover segment, a temporary loss in
hotel room inventory1, and increased competition from low-cost regional destinations. In 2013
growth in tourism visitors declined to 2.3 percent for the first nine months, from 8.3 percent in 2012,
and preliminary data indicate that hotel receipts fell 7½ percent in January–September. However,
increased construction at Baha Mar has helped support activity. Inflation has eased from 2 percent
in 2012 to an average of 0.3 percent for January–October 2013, in keeping with anemic activity and
softening fuel prices. Against a background of broadly subdued activity, unemployment rose to
16.2 percent in mid-2013.

2.
The fiscal situation deteriorated further in FY2012/13 (Tables 2–4 and Figure 2).
Revenue underperformed, mainly owing to slower-than-expected economic recovery and lower
customs revenues, while current spending, especially on wages and goods and services, remained
elevated at a time of general elections. Reflecting these developments, the fiscal deficit widened to
5½ percent of GDP. Further, the authorities contracted in late 2012 a US$180 million (2.2 percent of
GDP) external loan to stem the decline of foreign reserves, and central government debt rose to
56 percent of GDP (49 percent in FY2011/12).

3.
The current account deficit increased further in 2012 and 2013, pressuring reserve
adequacy. The deficit reached 17½ percent of GDP in 2012, up from 13½ percent in 2011, largely
driven by an increase of goods and services imports related to Baha Mar (Table 5). From a
saving/investment perspective, an increase in the investment/GDP ratio by 5 percentage points to
33 percent of GDP in 2012 outpaced a small increase in the saving ratio (Figure 4). Data indicate that
the current account imbalance has increased in 2013 owing to weakened tourism and on-going
construction of Baha Mar, with foreign reserves declining to $685 million in October from
$810 million at end-2012.
4.
Credit growth has slowed markedly
in recent years (Table 6). The economic
downturn in the wake of the global financial
crisis led to a near doubling of non-performing
loans (NPLs). Private sector credit has stalled
since 2009 as banks tightened lending
standards and debtors deleveraged. In the face
of declining profit margins, banks have
increased their interest rate spreads, largely
through cutting deposit rates. The financial
sector is otherwise in good overall standing.

Economic activity is expected to pick up more strongly from 2014 onward as the US recovery
accelerates and Baha Mar starts operations. As the fiscal deficit narrows over the medium term,
supported by ongoing consolidation efforts, and tourism activity picks up, the external current account
balance should strengthen as well, reducing pressures on foreign reserves. Despite upside potential in
the medium term, risks to the near-term outlook appear tilted downwards.
5.
Growth is expected to pick up over the medium term, reaching 2¾ percent in 2015–16,
while inflation is expected to remain subdued:


Demand should recover more strongly from 2014 onward as the US economic recovery
accelerates, raising stopover tourist arrivals. Investment is projected to remain strong in the near
term, but then to tail off as the Baha Mar project reaches a conclusion. Private consumption
growth is expected to be close to zero through 2014, as the ongoing fiscal consolidation
(Section A) and private deleveraging (below) take a toll (staff projections assume a current-year
fiscal multiplier of ½ and a second-year multiplier near zero, in line with findings for Caribbean
islands).2 However, consumption should gain strength as the pickup in the tourism sector

The multipliers estimates are based on a panel regression on 14 Caribbean countries including The Bahamas in
Narita, Fiscal Multipliers in the Caribbean, in International Monetary Fund, and Amo-Yartey and Turner-Jones (Eds),

bolsters employment and incomes, and this should help offset the impact of declining
investment, as the Baha Mar project reaches its conclusion.


A key factor underlying medium-term projections is the expected expansion in supply. The full
operation of Baha Mar could allow for an increase of almost 10 percent in total arrivals; and two
smaller hotel projects planned on Grand Bahama and Bimini islands could add another
2¼ percent in arrivals. Growth performance will also depend on success in addressing a number
of parallel supply challenges going forward, including expanding incoming airlift capacity;
addressing infrastructure bottlenecks; strengthening the linkages between tourism and other
sectors; and developing a more diversified tourism experience, including ongoing plans to boost
sports and health care-based tourism.



Inflation is expected to remain low, but planned VAT implementation in 2014 would add an
annualized 3½ percentage-points to the CPI (as reflected in staff’s baseline projections).

6.
In the financial sector, the medium-term outlook is for modest growth in bank lending
as the private sector adjusts its balance sheet, and banks deal with continuing problem loans.
Mortgage lending growth is likely to be limited: residential investment fell by one third in nominal
value during 2008–12 and ongoing deleveraging is expected to continue. Accordingly, private sector
demand for bank credit would remain subdued. And with tighter bank lending standards, the recent
fall in nominal private credit may be only slowly reversed. The stock of NPLs appears to have peaked
and is expected to slowly decline as well, with banks more willing to write off some NPL categories
(e.g., unsecured consumer debt), while continuing to find other flexible arrangements to deal with
nonperforming mortgages (which comprised 58 percent of the NPL portfolio at end-June 2013) in
light of continuing softness in the real estate market. Overall, however, banks’ balance sheets remain
robust and near term stability risks are limited (Table 6–7 and Figure 5).
7.
The external account balance should strengthen over the medium term, replenishing
official reserves. The Bahamas’ exchange rate appears to be broadly in line with macroeconomic
fundamentals, although the declining reserve position does raise some external stability concern
(Section B below). Nonetheless, the completion of Baha Mar would reduce construction imports and
boost tourism services exports. Overall, a decline in the investment/GDP ratio is projected against a
recovery in the saving rate––mostly the result of higher fiscal saving. With the current account deficit
thus projected to revert to lower, pre-global crisis and pre-Baha Mar levels, net external financing
needs would be contained, strengthening foreign reserves and external stability.
8.
Supported by the authorities’ budget consolidation efforts, the fiscal position is
projected to steadily improve in the period ahead. Last July, the authorities instituted new and/or
increased various business license fee rates applicable to on- and off-shore financial institutions, and
to state-owned enterprises; and introduced a new environmental levy and customs processing fees.
These are expected to be complemented by a VAT in July 2014. With regard to spending, the
authorities are implementing stronger controls, including on wages and goods and services outlays
in view of the excesses in the run up to the last general elections.

9.
With the primary budget projected to be balanced by FY2014/15 (from a projected
deficit of 1.9 percent of GDP for FY2013/14) and to move into surplus beyond, central
government debt would be contained and set on a declining path over the medium term.
There are however downside risks. Central government debt is projected to peak at nearly
60 percent of GDP in fiscal year 2014/15, but to decline to 55 percent of GDP by fiscal year 2017/18.
However, the forecast track record shows a tendency toward optimism in staff forecasts of real GDP
growth and the primary balance, pointing to downside risks to the baseline scenario. This
underscores the need for rigorous adherence to the ongoing fiscal consolidation program (DSA,
Annex I).
10.
Despite upside potential in the medium term, risks to the outlook appear tilted
downwards (Risk Assessment Matrix, page 20). The Bahamas faces a number of internal and
external risks, but the following risks could be especially disruptive, highlighting the need for timely
implementation of plans for fiscal consolidation and economic diversification:


Disappointing Baha Mar performance. Baha Mar’s success critically hinges on effective
implementation of the project’s strategic positioning (e.g., more focus on high-end products,
more diversification to Europe, South America and East Asia) in the region’s fiercely competitive
tourism market. While staff’s baseline is conservative about Baha Mar’s growth impact, and the
project was based on a thorough feasibility study, significantly lower-than-assumed net tourist
arrivals or expenditure relating to the project would limit the upside boost to domestic
economic activity. In a tail risk scenario where the project completely fails to raise overall
tourism exports, the uptick in growth currently projected for 2015 onward would not materialize,
with adverse implications for fiscal revenues and the public debt outlook (the project entails no
direct fiscal risks as it is entirely financed by foreign private sources). If the project did fail to
deliver, there could also be significant pressure on reserves, and maintaining external and
internal stability would then require a more aggressive approach to structural fiscal
consolidation.



Delay in fiscal consolidation. Delays in implementing fiscal consolidation, especially tax
revenue reforms, could pose risks to long-term debt sustainability and the country’s investment
grade credit rating. In affirming its rating of The Bahamas (BBB/A-2, with a negative outlook) in
November 2013, Standard and Poor’s warned that the agency could lower the rating by one or
two notches if the authorities do not take additional action to reduce the fiscal deficit and arrest
the increase in debt to GDP over the next several years. If revenue reforms do not deliver, the
authorities would need to implement deeper spending cuts to help hold debt down.



Lower than anticipated emerging market (EM) growth potential. With the tourism strategy
aimed at exploiting arrivals in part from EM countries, a further slowdown of EM growth would
undercut the growth outlook. That said, the negative impact could be tempered by an
accompanying decline in fuel prices. If tourism demand from new markets proves stagnant, the
authorities may need to pursue ambitious structural reforms to help reduce the internal price
level and draw in more demand from existing markets.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
Discussions focused on key policies to secure fiscal and public debt sustainability, external stability, and
robust economic growth. Achieving these objectives requires putting the budget on a sustainable path;
containing the external current account deficit and building up foreign reserves; promoting growth
through improved competitiveness and economic diversification; and continued reforms to advance
financial stability.

A. Ensuring Long-Run Fiscal Sustainability
11.
The authorities recognized that comprehensive policies are urgently needed to place
the government debt-to-GDP ratio on a declining path and support external stability. Central
government debt currently exceeds 50 percent of GDP, which makes The Bahamas a “High Scrutiny”

recent years. The authorities agreed that fiscal
performance needs immediate strengthening to reduce central government net financing
requirements, reverse the increasing debt trajectory, and begin rebuilding depleted policy buffers;
all of which would help contain borrowing costs in the economy in the medium term. They also
concurred that fiscal consolidation would create space for a healthy expansion of physical and social
infrastructure spending, and for higher outlays on human capital.
12.
Staff discussed with the authorities a medium-term fiscal framework aimed at
achieving a balanced budget and a fall in the debt ratio to some 55 percent of GDP by
FY2017/18 from a projected peak of 59 ½ percent in FY2014/15 (Tables 2 and 3). Under the
scenario, tax revenue would increase by an annual average of about 0.8 percentage-points of GDP
over the next five years, the bulk of which from planned introduction of the VAT; and only moderate

savings would be achieved on government expenditures in view of limited spending flexibility. In
this regard, the authorities especially stressed the elevated budgetary cost of basic infrastructure
and public utilities in an archipelago of sparsely populated and dispersed islands.

Revenue would rise to about 21 percent of GDP by FY2017/18 from 17 percent of GDP
in 2013/14. The revenue effort is underpinned by several critical measures and reforms, especially
(i) the upward revision of various business license fees in July 2013; (ii) introduction of a value added
tax (VAT) in July 2014; (iii) establishment of a Central Revenue Agency in the first quarter of 2014;
(iv) adoption of Tax Identification Numbers; (v) overhaul of customs administration in the context of
a $16.5 million IDB-funded reform project; and (vi) modernization of the real property tax (RPT)
system. The Bahamian Customs and RPT departments rely heavily on manual procedures and
outdated information systems; as a result, revenue collection is currently estimated at below
50 percent of the potential. Envisaged reforms aim to bring management of the two revenue
agencies up to international standards, involving extensive computerization of revenue assessment
and collection functions, and introduction of risk-based monitoring of operations. Staff concurred
with the authorities that reform of the two revenue departments could yield significant revenue
gains. However, given pervasive capacity limitations and the record of low tax compliance, staff
urged caution in factoring the anticipated revenue improvements into the medium-term fiscal
framework (Tables 3.1 and 3.2).
14.
The implementation of the VAT is the cornerstone of the authorities’ fiscal
consolidation agenda. The reform will provide a more efficient means to broaden the tax base,
increase revenues, and improve the effectiveness of tax administration more generally. The potential
revenue yield from a 15-percent VAT is generally estimated at slightly over 7 percentage points of
GDP.5 In The Bahamas, the reform’s net revenue gain is assessed at 2.2 percent of GDP in view of

Data on VAT productivity suggest that, on average, 1 percentage point of VAT collects revenue equivalent to about
½ percent of GDP.

VAT exemptions and other tax reductions expected to be adopted along with the new tax (the hotel
VAT rate will be at the regional Caribbean average of 10 percent) and of capacity limitations in
revenue management. Other limiting factors in the initial year of the reform include delays in rolling
out the public campaign and securing passage of relevant legislation in Parliament, which could
complicate the timely acquisition and testing of IT systems needed in both the public and private
sectors. The absence of a consumption tax and the lack of local experience in its management would
contain the initial revenue gains from the VAT as well. Because of these constraints, staff projects the
net revenue gain from the VAT at 1.3 percent of GDP for the initial FY2014/15.

An illustrative “no VAT” scenario shows the fiscal consolidation program veering considerably off
track, with the debt-to-GDP ratio already above 60 percent of GDP in FY2014/15 (figure below). Staff
underscored setting the VAT base as broadly as possible; and encouraged the authorities to insure
that adequate efforts and resources are deployed to secure the timely implementation of the
reform.

15.
The authorities’ fiscal consolidation program also calls for enhanced spending
discipline, especially as regards wages, goods and services, and subsidy outlays (Tables 2 and
3). Against a backdrop of more favorable employment prospects for the tourism sector, especially
after the opening of Baha Mar, pressure on central government hiring should be manageable
beyond 2014, permitting limitation of wage outlays to the last three years’ average of 7.4 percent of
GDP. Also, in view of unusually sharp increases in recent years, the growth of spending on goods
and services will be strictly limited. In the same vein, the authorities’ medium-term fiscal program
assumes some downsizing of the public investment budget given the completion last year of several
high-cost road and airport rehabilitation projects. Staff underscored keeping budget transfers and
subsidies in check as well; and, to that effect, urged the expeditious implementation of planned
reforms of public corporations, including adoption of cost-based pricing for public utilities to reduce
these entities’ net financing requirements (Box 1). Reflecting the ongoing and envisaged
expenditure-streamlining efforts, total spending is expected to be reduced by 0.8 percent of GDP
between FY2013/14 and FY2017/18, to 20.8 percent of GDP.
Box 1. Planned Reforms of Selected Public Corporations

The Bahamian public corporations (PCs) continue to face significant financial challenges, notably
stemming from inefficiencies in operations (e.g., excessive staffing, aged facilities), but also
reflecting these entities’ tacit social duty to provide affordable services to all residents including
in remote Family Islands. The PCs’ aggregate debt reached 16 percent of GDP at end-June 2013
(10 ½ percent in December 2008). Envisaged reforms aim to begin alleviating the companies’
financial distress.
Water and Sewage Corporation (WSC). In recent years, budget support to WSC has averaged
B$30-40 million annually (0.4 percent of 2013 GDP). To improve the entity’s operational efficiency

Bahamas Electricity Corporation (BEC). Envisaged reforms seek to achieve more competition in
the generation and higher efficiency in the distribution of power. Expected to be completed in
2014, they would break the BEC into two new entities.


A new generation service company would operate, maintain, repair, and manage BEC’s
electricity generation facilities as well as develop new power plants. Planned private sector
equity participation would permit involvement of energy sector partners of international
repute, as well as adequate resources for capacity building and modernization.



A new transmission and distribution company would operate, maintain, and expand BEC’s
current electricity transmission and distribution systems. The new entity would be
100 percent government owned, but operated by the private sector under a management
contract.

Staff commended the authorities for their commitment to fiscal consolidation and
welcomed their intention to introduce a rule-based fiscal framework. Although they have yet to
settle on the specifics of such a framework, the authorities saw the adoption of a fiscal rule as
essential to guarding against government fiscal shortsightedness (e.g., policy changes depending on
political cycle) and making achievement of medium-term fiscal targets more predictable, taking
account of The Bahamas’ country-specific conditions (e.g., small island state, vulnerability to natural
disasters). Resorting to a fiscal rule appears appropriate considering the rapid widening of the fiscal
deficit and increase in central government debt in the last years. However, a rule-based fiscal
framework has considerable transparency demands and requires a comprehensive coverage of fiscal
operations; it also needs to strike a reasonable balance between sustainability and flexibility goals,
and should make provisions for policy responses to unforeseen economic shocks (for instance,
natural disasters). Staff signaled Fund readiness to provide technical assistance.

B. Enhancing External Stability
17.
The Bahamas’ exchange rate appears to be broadly in line with macroeconomic
fundamentals. The peg to the U.S. dollar and low inflation have underpinned broad nominal (NEER)
and real effective exchange rates (REER) stability in the last years (Figure 3); and a quantitative
evaluation based on standard Consultative Group on Exchange Rate (CGER) methodologies reveals
no significant misalignment.7 This result is nevertheless contingent on execution of planned fiscal
adjustment and the successful implementation of ongoing efforts to expand tourism capacity,
further diversify the economy, and achieve stronger growth (see below and Figure 3).

7

The assessment based on the equilibrium real exchange rate approach (ERER) suggests that the real effective
exchange rate is overvalued by about 4 percent, while the macroeconomic balance (MB) approach suggests that the
rate is undervalued by 3 percent. An assessment based on the external sustainability (ES) approach was not
undertaken owing to lack of official data on the country’s international investment position (IIP). In addition, the lack
of official IIP data precludes estimates of imputed, but re-invested earnings on inward and outward foreign direct
investment positions, with offsetting imputed financial account flows. While this does not affect the overall balance
and therefore reserves, it likely results in underestimates of the current account deficit, and suggests that the
undervaluation from the MB approach is biased downward.

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

THE BAHAMAS

18.
The risks from the widened current account deficit and continuing pressures on
foreign reserves are considerable (Box 2). The financing requirements for the sizable Baha Mar
tourism project are broadly met through FDI and already-secured debt flows. However, a recent
weakening of tourism receipts, a diminution of previously available “one-off” capital inflows (from
privatization, bank capital increases, etc.), and an increase in commercial banks’ profit remittances in
light of extremely comfortable capital positions and a declining loan portfolio (about US$105 million
during January-October 2013) have resulted in a steady decline in reserves. This has led the
government, at Central Bank’s request, to shift the bulk of its budget deficit financing to external
loans, the proceeds of which (totaling $400 million for FY2013/14) have helped to bolster reserves.
The authorities recognized that the higher foreign debt increases the economy’s vulnerability to
external shocks, but saw the undertaking as temporary—pending materialization of anticipated
improvements in the external position in the medium term.
19.
Strong policy efforts are needed to stem a recent deterioration of the external
position and replenish reserves. A larger reserve cushion would help mitigate the impact of
negative shocks, provide more room for needed counter-cyclical policy responses, and enhance the
credibility of the peg. The Bahamas’ growth and external sector performance is heavily dominated
by developments in the US-dependent tourism sector. Although the country’s tourism market share
in the region has shown resilience in recent years,8 the high dependence on one sector makes the
economy highly vulnerable to external shocks. The authorities saw the recent and anticipated
expansion of the tourism base as key to reducing their country’s traditional reliance on North
American stopover tourists. They emphasized that progress on that front, together with
improvements in non-price competitiveness through removal of structural impediments to growth
(Figure 6), would strengthen the external position and enhance external sustainability going forward.

including gambling venues (e.g., Las Vegas and Atlantic City, as well as, with the opening of Baha Mar, Asian
alternatives), and family tourism (e.g., Disneyland and other Orlando sites), which complicates estimates of the
relevant markets.

Box 2. Assessment of Reserve Adequacy
The Bahamas’ international reserves declined by $75 million to $810 million in 2012. With external
current account imbalances persisting in the first half of 2013 and higher foreign-owned banks’ profit
remittances, reserves fell further to $685 million (1.6 months of imports or 2.8 months of non-FDI imports) at
end-October 2013 despite a foreign loan ($100 million) contracted by the government, which added
0.4 months of non-FDI import cover.
The country’s reserve adequacy profile is mixed.
Reserves are projected to comfortably cover all

reserve holdings are projected to remain substantially below the broad money norm of 20 percent, but related
risks would be relatively limited given the central bank’s strong restrictions on capital flows—all outward
capital transfers require exchange control approval, and outflows of resident-owned capital are restricted.
Finally, while reserves are expected to undershoot the broad money standard, they would be more than
adequate to cover the central bank’s demand liabilities (base money plus government deposits), which the
authorities use as an additional benchmark.
The country’s reserves holdings are broadly adequate

C. Maintaining Monetary and Financial Sector Stability
20.
Staff agreed with the authorities’ view that the Bahamas’ monetary framework
continues to serve the country well. The exchange rate peg to the dollar has been in place since
prior to independence 40 years ago. This stability has reflected the strong tourism and offshore
financial linkages with the United States, supported by a tradition of prudent fiscal policies
(notwithstanding recent developments, Bahamas still has relatively low levels of government debt).
The peg has delivered inflation performance in line with that for the country’s main trading partners.
The monetary framework has also helped deliver financial stability. The authorities remarked that
their capital controls were quite effective in shielding domestic monetary conditions from relevant
developments abroad. In their view, the eventual tapering of U.S. quantitative easing, with resulting
higher foreign interest rates, would likely not exert undue pressures on external reserves.
21.
The staff and authorities concurred that the current low policy rate remains
appropriate in light of weak credit demand and subdued domestic activity. The official discount
rate was reduced by 75 basis points in late 2011, to 4½ percent. Given sizable excess liquidity
already held by banks, the authorities were skeptical that a further cut would increase lending
activity. In this regard, while banks and the authorities welcomed improved transparency as part of
the soon-to-be introduced credit bureau (and argued for its wide usage—including by retailers),
they worried that knowledge of the true scope of domestic indebtedness may weaken incentives to
make credit more readily available and frustrate its growth. The reform was nonetheless seen as
essential to ensuring that future lending decisions are adequately informed.
22.
In view of persistently high NPL rates, the staff encouraged the authorities to continue
closely monitoring commercial banks’ credit risks and collateral values. NPLs remain elevated
(14 percent of total bank lending), although they appear to have peaked and are provisioned at over
50 percent. While banks have aggressively written off nonperforming consumer borrowing, in light
of weak real estate and labor markets, many saw little benefit from aggressively addressing nonperforming mortgages—which now account for the bulk of NPLs. Most viewed their case-by-case
approach to handling restructuring as sufficient, acknowledging that this would lengthen the
process, but seeing benefit in not flooding the market with foreclosures. The authorities viewed the
legal framework for a case-by-case approach (including the incentives) as adequate, and thus
supported the case-by-case handling of the litigious mortgages. However, they agreed with staff
that it would be desirable to develop more reliable house price indices to promote a more liquid
and transparent real estate market and thus help refine collateral assessments and provisioning.
23.
The authorities continue to make progress in implementing recommendations of the
2012 FSAP. The authorities have established a Systemic Risk Surveillance Committee to monitor the
stability of domestic banks; and, with IMF technical assistance, they are finalizing a financial crisis
management and resolution plan and legal framework as they endeavor to rationalize and further
strengthen the supervisory and regulatory frameworks. The insurance and securities sectors have
recently adopted new legal and institutional frameworks, and oversight is improving. Supervisors are
implementing other key recommendations from the 2012 FSAP (Box 3). The staff confirmed the
authorities’ commitment to undergo an AML/CFT assessment of compliance, although the standard
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 15

THE BAHAMAS

18-month deadline following completion of the July 2012 FSAP was likely to slip, with the
assessment expected in second half of 2014 under the aegis of the Caribbean Financial Action Task
Force (CFATF).
Box 3. Key Findings and Progress in Implementing Recommendations
of the July 2012 FSAP Mission
The FSAP mission found no short-term threats to financial stability. It noted that the country’s
financial system had weathered the global crisis reasonably well. Tight capital and exchange controls
supported The Bahamas’ U.S. dollar peg, helping to insulate the financial system from global stability
threats, while providing some scope for policy independence. In addition, while the offshore financial
sector is disproportionately large (with total assets about 75 times GDP), it contributes less than
3 percent to GDP as capital and exchange controls and limited exposure to the domestic real estate
market provide a credible and effective firewall that separates the offshore and onshore financial
systems. The mission also found that the onshore financial sector is resilient, and could withstand
substantial economic, solvency, and liquidity shocks. Other financial institutions (credit unions, the
insurance sector, and securities markets) have limited systemic impact.1
The mission concluded that the oversight of the financial system is independent and strong,
particularly with respect to banking supervision, and the authorities are addressing many of its
recommendations. Revisions to the Central Bank Act are in progress, while a committee for
implementing Basel III is now constituted. Actions are underway on creating a credit bureau and
enhancing the deposit insurance system; and a credit union act has been released for consultation with
relevant stakeholders. The FSAP team encouraged the authorities to persevere with efforts to
rationalize and further strengthen the supervisory and regulatory frameworks. In November 2013, a
Fund technical assistance mission recommended detailed legislative reforms to strengthen the bank
crisis resolution framework, including increasing deposit insurance funds, establishing recovery and
resolution plans, and further strengthening the provisions on emergency liquidity assistance.

While offshore centers in general may face pressures in future years from shifts in the global regulatory environment, concerns
of heightened financial sector risks in some advanced economies could increase the attractiveness of The Bahamas as a global
hub for international financial services.

D. Boosting Growth Potential
24.
The Bahamas faces many challenges in boosting its growth potential. First and
foremost, the country must attract sufficient tourist demand to fill the large impending increase in
supply. Second, labor market rigidities constrain the potential supply of labor in the medium-term.
Persistently high unemployment rates suggest the presence of wage rigidities, while business
surveys cite a lack of skilled labor as an important constraint to growth. Third, significant
impediments to the growth of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) include (i) limited access to
bank loans, training and business development services; (ii) a complex system of land administration
that raises business transaction costs; and (iii) weak trade-logistics mechanisms and customs
procedures that constrain SME access to external markets. As a result, SMEs are concentrated in low-

productivity services in less technology and knowledge-intensive areas.9 Fourth, there are more
general constraints to investment. The Bahamas slipped 7 places to 84th place in the 2014 World
Bank doing Business Indicators, mostly because other countries made improvements while the
Bahamas stood still or worsened slightly. The Bahamas has particularly low rankings in starting a
business, getting credit, protecting investors, enforcing contracts, and registering property.10
25.
There was general agreement between the authorities and staff that achieving
stronger growth requires diversifying tourism and the economy more generally.


Plans to diversify tourist source markets beyond the eastern seaboard of the US and to promote
non-traditional segments such as health care, sports, heritage and religious tourism are being
developed. In this regard, the authorities have allocated B$10 million in FY2013/14 to conduct
marketing for the Baha Mar resort.



Initiatives to strengthen human capital have included the opening of the National Training
Agency to provide vocational and technical job training to (school-drop out) young adults,
which the authorities showcased as a strong step toward addressing private-sector indentified
skills shortages in the workforce, particularly ahead of the opening of Baha Mar and other
investment projects in the Family Islands. In addition, the authorities have allocated B$30 million
for special education and the transition of the College of The Bahamas to University status. Also,
an agriculture college in progress would provide a foundation for the development of the
sector.



A new policy framework under consideration would enhance the creation and expansion of
small and medium sized enterprises and long-term employment opportunities.



On the business environment, the authorities intend to make key government agencies more
customer-friendly and their services easier to access (e.g., through expanding the e-Government
platform). The initial focus would be on improving services in business licensing, real property
tax administration, and customs.



Stronger economic diversification is being sought through the further development of financial
services, agriculture, and port services; and provision of appropriate physical (notably
competitive and reliable power) and social infrastructure, including through public-private
partnerships (PPPs)—while limiting the associated risks. Pending development of a formal PPPs
regulatory framework, they pointed to successful PPP arrangements achieved in recent years,
most notably in the case of a $400 million Nassau Airport refurbishing project.

As pointed out in an independent evaluation of the Doing Business survey, care should be exercised when
interpreting these indicators given subjective interpretation, limited coverage of business constraints, and a small
number of reporters, which tend to overstate the indicators' coverage and explanatory power (see
www.worldbank.org/ieg/doingbusiness).

26.
Staff welcomed the authorities’ plans to develop a comprehensive national
development plan (NDP) with technical assistance from the Inter-American Development
Bank. The NDP, to be prepared during the first nine months of 2014, would assess the country’s
macroeconomic performance, institutions and governance, and propose strategies to accelerate
economic, institutional, and social development over the medium term and long run. Within a
comprehensive framework, it would craft specific development strategies for (i) sectors with a
promising outlook, including tourism, agriculture, port services, and financial services, (ii) individual
islands, (iii) human capital, (iv) infrastructure, and (v) effective government.

E. Others
27.
The staff discussed recent developments in The Bahamas’ exchange system and the
legal framework for monetary policy with the authorities. The authorities confirmed that The
Bahamas has not introduced any new exchange measures on the making of payments and transfers
for current international transactions or measures that would give rise to multiple currency practices
since the last Article IV consultation. Revisions to the central bank act, mainly to further enhance
independence and policy flexibility in open market operations, are in progress and should be
completed by mid-2014.

STAFF APPRAISAL
Both the fiscal and external imbalances have widened in recent years, while reserves coverage is
slipping. In this light, close adherence to planned fiscal consolidation and accelerated implementation
of policies to bolster growth and competitiveness will be essential.
28.
The Bahamian economy is recovering from the global financial crisis, but at a painfully
slow pace. Economic activity should recover more strongly from 2014 onward with stronger growth
in the US and the opening of Baha Mar, helping to reduce high unemployment. However, growth
performance over the medium term will also depend on success in addressing a number of
challenges going forward, including diversifying tourist source markets and the tourism experience
and expanding incoming airlift capacity; advancing efforts to close infrastructure bottlenecks and
workforce skills shortages; and strengthening non-tourism sectors. Steadfast and timely execution of
needed reforms will be crucial.
29.
Rigorous implementation of the authorities’ fiscal consolidation plan is essential to
recapturing medium-term budget and debt sustainability. The VAT is the cornerstone of the
fiscal adjustment program; staff encourages the authorities to insure its timely and successful
launch. On the spending side, the efforts to reinforce expenditure controls and monitoring should
be accelerated, especially as regards goods and services and transfers; and reforms to improve the
weak financial position of key public corporations and rein in transfers and subsidies should be
given high priority.

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

THE BAHAMAS

30.
The introduction of a fiscal rule would enhance the predictability and credibility of
budget policies. This would notably help ensure that the authorities’ public finance reforms are
implemented within a well articulated and durable medium-term fiscal framework; staff encourages
the authorities to flesh out the reform’s details and implementation timeframe. The Fund stands
ready to provide technical assistance.
31.
The exchange rate peg has served The Bahamas well, and should be further supported
by efforts to restore budget and external viability and rebuild depleting policy buffers. Staff
encourages the authorities to closely adhere to prudent fiscal policies and structural reforms aimed
at preserving strong economic fundamentals.
32.
The steady implementation of key FSAP recommendations and enhanced monitoring
of developments in the financial system are commendable. The establishment of a Systemic Risk
Surveillance Committee, creation of a credit bureau, and strengthening of the deposit insurance
system should further strengthen the resilience of the financial system and improve its already
generally favorable standing. A financial crisis management and resolution plan is also under
preparation with Fund technical assistance. The high level of non-performing loans, however, calls
for intensifying the monitoring of financial institutions.
33.
The authorities’ efforts to craft a comprehensive national development plan (NDP) in
2014 to guide development efforts over the long run and insulate policies from the political
cycle are welcome. It would be important to ensure that the plan is completed in a timely fashion
and backed by a broad cross section of society to maximize its probability of success. Sustained
efforts will be needed to enhance structural competitiveness by strengthening the business
environment, improving educational standards to foster human capital development, and identifying
clear strategies for the development of islands and key sectors such as tourism, agriculture, financial
services, and port activities. Government initiatives in these areas should be informed by the NDP’s
pertinent guidance and recommendations.
34.
Staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation with The Bahamas be
conducted on the standard 12-month cycle.

1/ The equilibrium value is computed using the equilibrium real exchange rate approach as in Vitek
(2010).
2/ The current account (CA) norm is computed using the estimated parameters from the panel
regression in Vitek (2010), and staff medium-term projections for the conditioning variables. In
particular, the CA norm depends positively on the country's oil trade balance, the level of net foreign
assets, relative fiscal balance, and negatively with respect to relative income growth.

THE BAHAMAS

Annex I: Debt Sustainability Analysis
The Bahamas’ public debt1 is expected to be sustainable in the medium term given the authorities’
ongoing fiscal consolidation efforts and projected recovery of the economy. Under the baseline, public
debt is projected to peak at almost 60 percent of GDP in fiscal year 2014/15, but to fall to about
55 percent of GDP by fiscal year 2017/18 and remain on a declining trajectory thereafter, with the
government’s gross financing needs also declining gradually from 7.8 percent to about 2.2 percent of
GDP over the period. However, with the forecast track record showing a tendency toward optimism in
forecasts of real GDP growth and the primary balance, the baseline scenario faces downside risks.
While the recent increase in external borrowings to boost foreign reserves is an additional source of
vulnerability, the authorities’ explicit commitment to contain such borrowing is likely to be an
important mitigating factor.
The Bahamas’ public debt has steadily risen in recent years. From 33.5 percent of GDP in 2008, it is
expected to increase to almost 60 percent of GDP in fiscal year 2014/15. However, driven by
ongoing budget consolidation, the rising public debt trajectory is projected to be reversed gradually
(Figure 4 below). The DSA shows that public debt dynamics are mainly driven by the near-term
primary deficit, which is expected to be eliminated over the medium term as fiscal consolidation
already in train accelerates notably following the introduction of the value-added tax in fiscal year
2014/15. The anticipated strengthening of real GDP growth over the medium term, initially
underpinned by the nearly completed $3.5 billion Baha Mar tourist project, would also help curb the
rise in the public debt ratio.
Risks arising from the maturity or currency composition of public debt are moderate, as short term
debt and foreign currency denominated debt constitute relatively small fractions of total debt.
Importantly, fiscal consolidation will be key to mitigating the risks to the baseline scenario—medium
term projections using historical averages for the macroeconomic and fiscal paths or a constant
primary balance indicate a sharp further rise of public debt, exceeding 70 percent of GDP over the
medium term, with elevated gross financing needs as well.
The forecast track record shows a waning of optimism tendencies in forecasts of real GDP growth in
recent years; and the unfavorable debt dynamics under assumption of historical performance for the
primary balance underscores the need for stronger efforts in addressing the implementation risks
and ensuring rigorous adherence to the ongoing fiscal consolidation program. While the projected
fiscal adjustment is relatively large compared to relevant cross-country experiences, staff expects the
undertaking to be generally manageable, given the authorities’ commitment to and preparation of
envisaged reforms and a moderate fiscal multiplier. Boom-bust risk is limited in light of relatively
slow pace of economic recovery and very weak credit growth in recent years.

The analysis is limited to central government debt as the operations of public corporations are not compiled into a
consolidated set of public sector accounts.

THE BAHAMAS

The DSA’s macro-fiscal stress tests indicate a moderate sensitivity of public debt to a variety of
shocks, with the greatest sensitivity being to real GDP growth shocks and sensitivity to exchange
rate shocks the lowest of the various shocks considered, including those to the real interest rate and
the primary balance. The combined macro-fiscal shock scenario yields a public debt ratio exceeding
70 percent of GDP and gross financing needs of 7 percent of GDP in fiscal year 2017/18.
The heat map of public debt risks confirms the moderate sensitivity of the debt level to macro
shocks, and reveals a low sensitivity of gross financing needs to the same set of shocks. While the
recent uptick in short-term public debt may raise concerns about the debt profile, short-term
liabilities remain a relatively small portion of total public debt (some 12 percent in 2012), have on
average been stable during 2001–12, and are mostly held domestically. Recent increases in external
borrowing warrant greater scrutiny. To bolster foreign reserves, the government contracted a
US$180 million external loan in fiscal year 2012/13; the authorities also shifted the bulk of their
deficit financing in fiscal year 2013/14 to external borrowings (contracting a US$100 million foreign
loan in October 2013 and contemplating an additional US$300 million for the remainder of fiscal
year 2013/14). The authorities concur that external borrowing to accumulate foreign reserves should
be used only as a temporary measure as the policy increases the country’s external debt service
burden and makes the government’s balance sheet more vulnerable to external shocks. They are
committed to insuring that such borrowing is rigorously contained.
Absent comprehensive data on private external debt, the external DSA was limited to that for
external public debt. The Bahamas’ external public debt is relatively low, but moderately sensitive to
shocks to the non-interest current account and the exchange rate.

1/ Public sector is defined as central government.
2/ Bond Spread over U.S. Bonds.
3/ Defined as interest payments divided by debt stock at the end of previous year.
4/ Derived as [(r - p(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; p = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;
a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
5/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 4 as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
6/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as ae(1+r).
7/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes during the projection period.
8/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation with The Bahamas
On January 17, 2014, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with The Bahamas on a lapse-of-time basis, and
considered and endorsed the staff appraisal without a meeting.1,2
Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 1.8 percent in 2012, similar to 2011, but well
below pre-global crisis performance; it is projected at nearly 2 percent for 2013.
Unemployment rose to 16.2 percent in mid-2013. While tourist arrivals and expenditures
have been subdued, brisk investment and construction for the Baha Mar resort project have
helped support economic activity. In keeping with weak domestic demand and softening fuel
prices, inflation is generally under control. The fiscal deficit widened to 5½ percent of GDP
in FY 2012/13, mainly due to customs revenue underperformance; and the current account
deficit reached 17½ percent of GDP in 2012, up from 13½ percent in 2011, largely driven by
sustained goods and services imports related to Baha Mar. Foreign reserves were the
equivalent of 1.6 months of imports (2.8 months of non-FDI imports) at end-October 2013.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every
year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the
country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms
the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

2

The lapse of time procedure is proposed for article IV consultations where the following conditions apply: (i) there
are no acute or significant risks, or general policy issues requiring Board discussion; (ii) policies or circumstances are
unlikely to have significant regional or global impact; (iii) in the event a parallel program review is being completed, it
is also being completed on a lapse-of-time basis; and (iv) the use of Fund resources is not under discussion or
anticipated.

46

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

THE BAHAMAS

Economic expansion should strengthen from 2014 onward with higher growth in the U.S.
and the opening of Baha Mar, helping to reduce the high unemployment rate. Supported by
the authorities’ budget consolidation efforts, the fiscal position should steadily improve in the
period ahead. Central government debt is projected to peak at nearly 60 percent of GDP in
fiscal year 2014/15, but to begin declining by fiscal year 2017/18. The risks from the
widened current account deficit and continuing pressures on foreign reserves are still
considerable. However, the completion of Baha Mar could reduce construction imports and
boost tourism services exports, strengthening foreign reserves and external stability. Private
sector demand for bank credit will likely remain subdued over the near term. While elevated
NPL levels have stabilized, they will likely recede slowly as growth and employment pick up,
and the debt overhang is reduced. Nevertheless, the banking system has ample capital and
liquidity buffers. Despite upside potential in the medium term, risks to the outlook appear
tilted downwards. Especially disruptive would be a disappointing Baha Mar performance,
delay in fiscal consolidation, and lower than anticipated emerging market growth potential.
The risks highlight the need for timely implementation of plans for fiscal consolidation and
economic diversification.

Exchange Rate Arrangement:
The Bahamas has a conventional fixed peg arrangement, with the Bahamian dollar pegged to the
U.S. dollar at B$1 per US$1. The Bahamas has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3,
and 4 of the Articles of Agreement and maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on
the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions. There have been no
changes in exchange restrictions since the last Article IV consultation.

Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance:
Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance. In particular, all critical macroeconomic data,
including comprehensive central government finance statistics, are regularly published in the Central
Bank of the Bahamas’ “Monthly Economic and Financial Developments” and “Quarterly Statistical
Digest”. However, the authorities have yet to develop the institutional capacity for the compilation of
international investment position (IIP) statistics and general government accounts data. Also, The
Bahamas has still not started compiling balance of payments statistics consistent with the Balance of
Payments Manual 6. The authorities have expressed interest in technical assistance in the latter two
areas, and Fund is ready to provide assistance upon their formal request.
Last Article IV Consultation:
The Bahamas is on a 12-month consultation cycle. The last Article IV consultation was concluded by
the Executive Board on February 4, 2013 (IMF Country Report No. 13/100).

FINANCIAL RELATIONS WITH THE INTER-AMERICAN
DEVELOPMENT BANK
Recent Country Strategy
The current Country Strategy (CS) for 2010–2014 supports the efforts of the government of
The Bahamas (GoBH) to increase productivity and growth by improving infrastructure and
enhancing competitiveness of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). The CS priority areas are:
energy, water and sanitation, transport, and SME development. As of October 2013, the InterAmerican Development Bank’s (IADB) sovereign-guaranteed portfolio had an average age of
1.9 years and had grown from two loans totaling US$113 million in 2010 to eight loans totaling
US$333 million. The envelope of US$195 million was exceeded primarily due to the need to provide
countercyclical support to the government’s efforts to counteract the economic downturn that was
triggered by the global financial crisis. Private sector support has been provided primarily via four
multilateral investment fund operations, totaling US$852,764.
The technical cooperation portfolio is extensive, with total approvals of US$6.8 million. Most of the
portfolio is in infrastructure (89 percent) that is critical to the tourism industry. Trade accounts for
5 percent of the portfolio, while education and social protection amount to 4 percent and 2 percent,
respectively. Performance indicators have improved over the past three years, mainly due to better
project execution in the road transport subsector.
The proposed Country Strategy 2013–2017, which was presented to IDB’s Board of Directors in
November 2013, would support transformative initiatives of GoBH to ensure macroeconomic
sustainability; ensure social stability and employment; and increase resilience to the negative
impacts of climate change. CS priority areas include: (1) Public Finances and Management; (2) Citizen
Security and Justice; (3) Energy; (4) Private Sector Development; and (5) Coastal Risk Management
and Climate Change Adaptation.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Statistical data are broadly adequate for surveillance purposes, but some weaknesses remain.
The central bank produces annual, quarterly, and monthly reports on macroeconomic developments,
and monetary and fiscal data, and is the main source of economic information. The operations of
public corporations are not compiled into a consolidated set of public sector accounts, although
their debt is included in the public debt data. Thus, a presentation of the general government
accounts, including revenue, expenditure, and overall balance is not available.
During 2009 and 2010, the main focus of the Department of Statistics (DoS) was the preparation and
execution of the 2010 census (carried out every 10 years). The DoS also embarked on a series of
initiatives to improve the national accounts, including rebasing the GDP.
The DoS updated the CPI methodology with technical assistance from CARTAC. The base year was
moved to 2010 from 1995, and additional categories were introduced, with higher weights for some
items, including for transport and communications. At the same time, the coverage was expanded to
include the island of Abaco, in addition to the two islands already covered by the CPI (New
Providence and Grand Bahama).
New export-import price indices (XMPI) for goods and major services were developed with technical
assistance from CARTAC. Procedures for systematic re-sampling and re-weighting were modified in
order to keep the market basket representative of what is being measured.
The Bahamas does not prepare data covering the economy-wide external debt position, nor an
international investment position (IIP), although they have stated their intention to do so, and to
adopt Balance of Payments Manual 6 (BMP6).
The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), with the technical support of the United States Census
Bureau (USCB), has promoted the development of a methodology called “Tool for Assessing
Statistical Capacity” (TASC). This is a self-assessment instrument the general purpose of which is
measuring and evaluating the statistical capacity of a country’s National Statistical System (NSS),
and more specifically, the operational capacity of its National Statistical Office (NSO), to produce
and disseminate basic statistics drawn from censuses, surveys and administrative records. There was
a mission in The Bahamas to meet with the Department of Statistics in late November, 2013.
Looking ahead, the main activities of the DoS in the coming years will include producing and
disseminating comprehensive census data and implementing bi-annual labor force surveys.
The Bahamas began participating in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) in 2003. Its
metadata were posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board on February 14, 2003.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation with The Bahamas
On January 17, 2014, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with The Bahamas on a lapse-of-time basis, and
endorsed the staff appraisal without a meeting.1,2
Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is projected to grow at nearly 2 percent for 2013,
similar to 2012, but well below pre-global crisis performance. Unemployment rose to
16.2 percent in mid-2013. While tourist arrivals and expenditures have been subdued, brisk
investment and construction for the Baha Mar resort project have helped support economic
activity. As domestic demand remains weak and fuel prices are softening, inflation is
generally under control. The fiscal deficit widened to 5½ percent of GDP in the Fiscal Year
2012/13 (July 1-June 30), mainly due to customs revenue underperformance; and the
current account deficit reached 17½ percent of GDP in 2012, up from 13½ percent in 2011,
largely driven by sustained goods and services imports related to Baha Mar. Foreign
reserves were the equivalent of 1.6 months of imports (2.8 months of non-FDI imports) at
end-October 2013.
Economic expansion should strengthen from 2014 onward, with higher growth in the U.S.
and the opening of Baha Mar helping to reduce the high unemployment rate. The
authorities’ budget consolidation efforts should help improve the fiscal position. Central
government debt is projected to peak at nearly 60 percent of GDP in fiscal year 2014/15,
and to decline to 55 percent of GDP in fiscal year 2017/18. The completion of Baha Mar
should reduce construction imports and boost tourism services exports, strengthening
external stability. The banking system has ample capital and liquidity buffers. Elevated non1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every
year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the
country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms
the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

2

The lapse of time procedure is proposed for article IV consultations where the following conditions apply: (i) there
are no acute or significant risks, or general policy issues requiring Board discussion; (ii) policies or circumstances are
unlikely to have significant regional or global impact; (iii) in the event a parallel program review is being completed, it
is also being completed on a lapse-of-time basis; and (iv) the use of Fund resources is not under discussion or
anticipated.

2
performing loans levels have stabilized, and will likely recede slowly as growth and
employment pick up, and the debt overhang is reduced. Nevertheless, private sector
demand for bank credit will likely remain subdued over the near term. There remain risks to
the outlook, including shortfalls in Baha Mar performance, a delay in fiscal consolidation,
and lower than anticipated tourist arrivals in the event that global growth weakens. The risks
highlight the need for timely implementation of plans for fiscal consolidation and economic
diversification.
Executive Board Assessment
In concluding the 2013 Article IV consultation with The Bahamas, Executive Directors
endorsed the staff appraisal, as follows:
The Bahamian economy is recovering from the global financial crisis, but at a painfully slow
pace. Economic activity should recover more strongly from 2014 onward with firmer growth
in the U.S. and the opening of Baha Mar, helping to reduce high unemployment. However,
growth performance over the medium term will also depend on success in addressing a
number of challenges going forward, including diversifying tourist source markets and the
tourism experience and expanding incoming airlift capacity; advancing efforts to close
infrastructure bottlenecks and workforce skills shortages; and strengthening non-tourism
sectors. Steadfast and timely execution of needed reforms will be crucial.
Rigorous implementation of the authorities’ fiscal consolidation plan is essential to
recapturing medium-term budget and debt sustainability. The VAT is the cornerstone of the
fiscal adjustment program; the authorities should ensure its timely and successful launch.
On the spending side, the efforts to reinforce expenditure controls and monitoring should be
accelerated, especially as regards goods and services spending and transfers; and reforms
to improve the weak financial position of key public corporations and rein in transfers and
subsidies should be given high priority.
The introduction of a fiscal rule would enhance the predictability and credibility of budget
policies. This would notably help ensure that the authorities’ public finance reforms are
implemented within a well articulated and durable medium-term fiscal framework. The
reform’s details and implementation timeframe authorities should be fleshed out; and the
Fund stands ready to provide technical assistance.
The exchange rate peg has served The Bahamas well, and should be further supported by
efforts to restore budget and external viability and rebuild depleting policy buffers. The
authorities are encouraged to closely adhere to prudent fiscal policies and structural reforms
aimed at preserving strong economic fundamentals.
The steady implementation of key Financial Sector Assessment Program recommendations
and enhanced monitoring of developments in the financial system are commendable. The

3
establishment of a Systemic Risk Surveillance Committee, creation of a credit bureau, and
strengthening of the deposit insurance system should further strengthen the resilience of
the financial system and improve its already generally favorable standing. A financial crisis
management and resolution plan is also under preparation with Fund technical assistance.
The high level of non-performing loans, however, calls for intensifying the monitoring of
financial institutions.
The authorities’ efforts to craft a comprehensive national development plan (NDP) in 2014
to guide development efforts over the long run and insulate policies from the political cycle
are welcome. It would be important to ensure that the plan is completed in a timely fashion
and backed by a broad cross section of society to maximize its probability of success.
Sustained efforts will be needed to enhance structural competitiveness by strengthening the
business environment, improving educational standards to foster human capital
development, and identifying clear strategies for the development of islands and key sectors
such as tourism, agriculture, financial services, and port activities. Government initiatives in
these areas should be informed by the NDP’s pertinent guidance and recommendations.
