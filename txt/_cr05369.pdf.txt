EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background
Economic performance has been impressive, due in significant measure to sound policies.
In line with the global cycle, growth picked up strongly in 2004. Rapid employment growth
was supported by immigration, so the unemployment rate was roughly unchanged and wage
growth remained moderate. House price appreciation has slowed, but house prices are high
on various measures. Real effective exchange rate appreciation over the past few years has
raised Ireland’s cost levels above those of its main trading partners.
Key policy issues
Outlook: The authorities and staff agreed that economic growth is likely to be very strong
in the short term. The housing market was regarded as headed for a soft landing, though the
risk of a sharp decline was acknowledged. The authorities and staff agreed that a further
erosion of external competitiveness would be a concern. The shared view was that the
economy is at about full employment, so rapid growth could give rise to overheating,
though there are uncertainties about supply potential. The risks to the forecast are balanced.
Fiscal policy: While public finances are strong, the 2005 budget implies sizable fiscal
stimulus, which is ill-advised for an economy close to full employment. There was
agreement that fiscal tightening would be desirable to dampen aggregate demand in the
short term and to build a cushion in the event that downside risks materialize in the medium
term. The shared view was that further efforts are needed to improve value for money in the
delivery of public services. Views diverged on the extent of institutional innovation needed
to enhance the focus on strategic issues in the public debate of fiscal policy.
Labor market and wage policy: Labor market flexibility in Ireland is good. However, as
labor costs are high, the authorities and staff agreed that wage moderation is needed in both
the upcoming national wage agreement and the next public sector benchmarking exercise.
Moreover, the methodology and transparency of benchmarking could be improved.
Financial stability: While banking system profitability and capitalization are strong,
vulnerabilities exist, so there was agreement that continued efforts are needed to maintain
financial stability. The priorities are to further strengthen stress-testing and credit standards,
and to prepare an update to the Financial Stability Report.
Structural issues: Important progress has been made in preparing for population aging, but
there are concerns that households are not saving enough for retirement. The authorities and
staff discussed options to raise household saving. While product market reform is welladvanced, there was agreement that better regulation is needed to stimulate competition in
some sectors, including banking and insurance, professional services, and retail.

I. BACKGROUND
1.
Economic performance in Ireland was extraordinary during the 1990s and has
remained impressive in recent years. Real GNP grew by 6½ percent per year on average
between 1990–99 and by 4¾ percent per year during the 2000–04 cycle.1 The
unemployment rate fell sharply to one of the lowest rates among industrial countries. HICP
inflation is now

close to the euro area average. This remarkable performance reflected both good policies
and fortunate circumstances. Prudent government spending created the scope for reductions
in both public debt and taxes. Social partnership agreements and income tax cuts supported
wage moderation, which—along with low corporate tax rates, EU membership, and the
global ICT boom—encouraged investment. The EU provided funds for infrastructure
investment, and participation in EMU lowered interest rates. Favorable demographics
increased the share of the working-age population.
2.
Following a downturn in 2001–02, real GNP growth picked up in 2003–04
(Table 1). Notwithstanding the appreciation of the euro, export growth rebounded in line
with the global upturn, and net exports made an increased contribution to growth.
Investment accelerated strongly, supported by improving business confidence and low ECB
interest rates. Consumption growth was somewhat less buoyant, reflecting contractionary
fiscal policy and a slow recovery of consumer confidence from its post-ICT boom decline.
All in all, real GNP expanded by 5½ percent in 2004.

The substantial contribution of multinationals to Irish output and the associated profit
repatriation create a large difference between GDP and GNP. GNP excludes payments to
foreign factors of production and is a better measure of national income.

In line with the economic upturn, labor demand strengthened in 2004.
Employment grew by 3 percent, boosted by immigration, especially from new EU member
states. As a result, the unemployment rate was roughly unchanged at 4½ percent, and wage
growth in the private sector remained moderate. However, with the appreciation of the
euro, compensation per employee is now higher in Ireland than in the EU-15 or the U.K.
The dampening impact of euro appreciation on consumer prices more than offset upward
pressure from higher oil prices, so average HICP inflation fell to 2¼ percent.

House price appreciation has slowed, but house prices remain relatively high.
The pace of house price increases has slowed gradually since mid-2003 to 3–5 percent
(annual rate) in recent months (Figure 1). In line with easing house price appreciation, the
rise in house completions has slowed. However, staff analysis suggests that not all of the
increase in house prices over the past several years can be attributed to fundamentals and
that the estimated house price overvaluation in Ireland is relatively large compared to other

countries (though—given the inherent uncertainties in these types of calculations—it is
difficult to be precise about the degree of overvaluation).2 The size of the construction
sector is correspondingly large, with the ratio of gross value added in construction to GNP
surpassed only by Spain in Europe. Despite slowing house price appreciation, mortgage
credit growth remains high, and household debt as a share of disposable income continues
to rise sharply.
5.
A center coalition government has been in power since June 1997 and was reelected in May 2002. Fianna Fail, the senior coalition partner, lost ground at the local and
European elections in June 2004. In the subsequent cabinet reshuffle, a new minister for
finance was appointed. General elections must take place by mid-2007.
II. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
6.
Ireland’s continuing economic success reinforces the view that good policies
have powerful effects. Indeed, the economy is enviably well positioned to sustain strong
growth over the medium term. Nonetheless, the authorities and staff acknowledged that
even good policies can be improved, that turbulence from various disturbances—both
domestic and external—is always a risk, and that population aging presents challenges. As
in recent years (Box 1), the discussions focused on attuning policies to the key challenges
to maintaining strong economic performance:

2

•

Given rapid real GNP growth recently, could the continuation of very strong growth
give rise to pressures on capacity constraints?

•

How can fiscal policy help to relieve potential overheating and build a cushion in
the event that downside risks, notably in the housing market, materialize?

•

Is competitiveness at risk, and how can the forthcoming national wage agreement
and public sector benchmarking exercise help to safeguard it?

•

With credit growth—especially to the property sector—remaining high, what
further efforts are needed to maintain financial stability?

•

From a longer-term perspective, how can households be encouraged to save for
retirement, given Ireland’s relatively frugal state pension system?

Box 1. Fund Policy Recommendations and Implementation
Ireland’s impressive economic performance since the early 1990s reflects in significant
measure the implementation of sound policies consistent with Fund advice. In recent years,
the authorities have generally responded appropriately to policy challenges identified in
previous consultations (the 2004 PIN is available at
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pn/2004/pn04122.htm):
Fiscal policy: The authorities are committed to the SGP, including the medium-term fiscal
objective of close to balance or surplus, which the Fund fully supports. However, the fiscal
stance has tended to be procyclical, contrary to Fund recommendations. To limit the
potential for procyclical stimulus while increasing the predictability, transparency, and
efficiency of spending, the Fund has called for a medium-term expenditure framework.
Spending envelopes have been introduced for capital spending but not for current spending.
Wage policies: The present three-year national wage agreement contained a considerable
degree of wage moderation relative to the past and offered no fiscal concessions, consistent
with Fund recommendations. However, progress in limiting public sector wages has been
more limited.
Housing market: The authorities’ public communication strategy to tame expectations and
help induce a soft landing in the housing market, as well as the absence of new fiscal
measures to attempt to fine tune the housing market, have been in line with Fund advice.
Financial sector: Financial supervision has been and continues to be strengthened along
the lines recommended in the 2000 FSAP and subsequent consultations. An FSAP Update
is planned for 2006.
Competition: The pace of regulatory reform has been slower than recommended by the
Fund.
A. Outlook: Strong Growth Creates Potential for Wage Pressures
7.
The authorities and the staff agreed that economic growth is likely to be very
strong in the short term (Table 2). Staff project real GNP growth in 2005–06 of about
5 percent, driven by an acceleration in private consumption, in turn supported by strong
employment and income growth, fiscal stimulus in 2005, and withdrawals from the Special

Savings Incentive Accounts (SSIAs) that will begin in mid-2006.3 Business investment is
expected to remain robust, reflecting low interest rates and the continued strength of the
global economy. With the gradual cooling of the housing market, residential investment is
projected to decline modestly starting next year. Net exports are expected to continue to
make significant contribution to growth, but at a declining rate, as domestic demand in
Ireland is stronger than that in its main trading partners. Officials at the central bank and the
Department of Finance gave broadly similar characterizations of the outlook.
8.
The shared view was that the economy is at about full employment, so
continued rapid growth could give rise to overheating. The unemployment rate in the
first quarter was 4¼ percent, not far from its historical low and in the vicinity of most
estimates of the NAIRU. While there are uncertainties about the economy’s supply
potential, including with regard to the role of immigration in relieving incipient labor
shortages, there was agreement that projected growth in 2005–06 is somewhat above
potential growth, which could give rise to upward pressures on wages and prices. Staff’s
baseline projection is for a slight increase in HICP inflation to 2½ percent next year.

3

Individuals receive a 25 percent tax credit on contributions to SSIAs (up to a ceiling).
SSIAs were introduced in 2001–02 and must be held for five years to avoid an exit tax.

The authorities and staff agreed that a further erosion of external
competitiveness would be a concern. The economy-wide ULC- and CPI-based real
effective exchange rates have appreciated substantially since 2002, though the pace of
appreciation slowed in 2004.4 Real effective exchange rate appreciation has reflected a
combination of nominal effective exchange rate appreciation and relatively high growth of
prices and wages.

With the strengthening of the euro against the U.S. dollar and—to a lesser extent—sterling,
the nominal effective exchange rate has increased by about 14 percent since 2002. At the
same time, consumer price and economy-wide ULC inflation rates in excess of partner
country rates have raised Ireland’s cost levels above those of its main trading partners.
Notwithstanding the real effective exchange rate appreciation, the authorities noted that the

pipeline of inward foreign direct investment remains healthy and prospects for export
growth continue to be strong (Table 3). Staff did not see the current level of
competitiveness as an immediate, major concern, observing that Ireland’s share of
industrial country exports of goods and services—after rising during the late 1990s—now
appears to have stabilized.
10.
The housing market is widely regarded as headed for a soft landing, though
the authorities and staff acknowledged the risk of a sharp decline. Survey evidence
suggests that expectations of house price appreciation have declined in line with the easing
of actual house price appreciation. The authorities argued that the underlying demand for
housing is relatively strong, noting that the number of dwellings per capita in Ireland is still
low compared to other advanced economies in Europe. Nonetheless, the authorities and
staff agreed that house prices are relatively high on a variety of measures, including the
price-earnings ratio in the housing market, which is still about double its historical average
and one-and-a-half times its 2002 level. Although the authorities cited estimates that only
about one sixth of the houses built between 2000–04 are second homes or buy-to-let
properties, market analysts indicate that a much higher percentage of recent construction
falls into these two categories.

The authorities and staff saw the risks
to the forecast as being broadly balanced.
Upside risks include stronger-than-expected
effects of fiscal stimulus and recovering
confidence on domestic demand, especially
private consumption and residential investment.
On the downside, the key domestic risk is that the
housing market could slow more quickly than
currently envisaged, with adverse consequences
for employment and wealth. However, the house
price boom does not appear to have depressed
household saving, so price declines would not

necessarily weaken consumption directly. The main external risks are oil prices and the
possibility of a disorderly resolution of global imbalances, which could sharply dampen
external demand and inward foreign direct investment.
B. Fiscal Policy: Avoiding Procyclicality and Building a Cushion
12.
Ireland’s public finances are currently strong, but staff noted that fiscal policy
has been procyclical in recent years (Table 4). Gross public debt is about 30 percent of
GDP, among the lowest in the EU; taxes on labor and business income are relatively low;
and the general government fiscal position has been either close to balance or in surplus
since 1996. However, fiscal policy was expansionary during 2001–02, when economic
activity was somewhat higher than potential, and contractionary during 2003–04, when the
output gap was negative. In addition, staff analysis finds that between 1991–2003 revenue
windfalls, reflecting higher-than-projected economic growth, were usually associated with
increased spending (Box 2). The improvement in the general government balance in 2004
(of 1.1 percent of GDP to a surplus of 1.3 percent of GDP) was much stronger than
expected, reflecting higher-than-projected growth and one-off factors (receipts from
revenue investigations and underspending of the capital budget).
Box 2. Favorable Fiscal Surprises: Luck or Prudence?
Public debt has fallen sharply, reflecting in part favorable fiscal surprises, i.e., outcomes that
exceeded budget projections. Staff analysis finds that favorable surprises between 1995–2003
reflected primarily fortunate circumstances (stronger-than-expected economic growth and buoyant
asset prices) but prudence also played a role (under-projection of revenue elasticity).1 Interestingly,
revenue overperformance tended to be associated with higher-than-projected expenditure, i.e., some
of the good luck was spent (more so than in other industrial countries, see left panel). As a result,
the favorable surprises on the overall fiscal balance were not much greater than the average for other
industrial countries (see right panel).

The authorities acknowledged that the budget for 2005 implies a fiscal
deterioration (Table 5). The budget envisages a swing in the overall balance of 1.7 percent
of GDP, reflecting mainly higher social welfare payments (0.6 percent of GDP; for old age
pensions, child benefit, and unemployment assistance), increased income tax credits and
rate bands (0.4 percent of GDP; to ensure that workers on the minimum wage are fully
outside the tax net and to partially compensate for the lack of indexation of the bands), and
higher public sector pay (0.3 percent of GDP; consistent with previously announced wage
increases). Since the budget was released in December, revenues in 2004 and the first few
months of 2005 have been stronger than expected. At the same time, the Supreme Court has
ruled that the government must reimburse certain nursing home charges received over the
past 30 years. Altogether, staff now project that the cyclically adjusted general government
balance excluding one-off factors will decline by more than 1 percent of GDP to a deficit of
about ½ percent of GDP. Staff observed that the size and timing of the fiscal stimulus are
ill-advised for an economy that is close to full employment. While not disputing this point,
the authorities noted that the fiscal expansion in 2005 followed two years of contractionary
budgets, while also reflecting certain social priorities.

Staff suggested that, given Ireland’s cyclically advanced position and
accommodative euro area monetary policy, fiscal tightening would be desirable. The
authorities agreed that, during the remainder of 2005, budget execution should remain
prudent and any revenue windfalls should be saved, as they had been in 2004. Staff
recommended an improvement in the cyclically adjusted fiscal balance of ½ percent of
GDP in 2006. While noting strong pressures for higher spending, the authorities said that
next year’s fiscal position would be in line with their medium-term objective of close to
balance or surplus, though preparatory work for the 2006 budget is not yet underway. Staff
noted that a balanced budget target in 2006 would be consistent with its call for fiscal
tightening. The authorities shared the view that, if aggregate demand were to weaken
unexpectedly and abruptly, possibly due to a sharper-than-currently envisaged slowdown in
the housing market, automatic stabilizers should be allowed to operate fully.

- 14 -

16.
Regarding the composition of adjustment, staff suggested that the growth of
current spending should be restrained and that the tax base should be broadened.
Given Ireland’s relatively low level of public capital, the authorities argued—and staff
agreed—that a continued high level of government investment is appropriate. However,

The authorities concurred that fiscal restraint is needed from medium- and
long-term perspectives. They noted that a small open economy like Ireland is subject to
global shocks, such as the equity market bust in 2001, which led to a 3½ percent of GDP
deterioration in the fiscal balance. They also

welcomed the pre-funding, but noted that it is
expected to cover only about one third of the
increase in pension spending. The authorities
observed that a decline in government spending on infrastructure over the long term would
provide room for higher age-related spending. Staff accepted this point, but noted that the
scope for reducing infrastructure spending might not be that great (between 2002–04,
Ireland spent 4¾ percent of GNP while the industrial country average was 3 percent of
GDP). Staff argued that, besides the pre-funding under the NPRF (which currently amounts
to about 10 percent of GNP), a further gradual reduction in gross public debt would help
prepare for higher age-related spending. In addition, staff suggested that the NPRF avoid
potential conflicts of interests in its investment strategy, which could arise in recently
authorized (but not yet undertaken) investments in domestic private public partnerships.

- 15 -

staff noted that non-interest current spending had risen by more than 3 percent of GDP
between 2000–04, reflecting across-the-board increases. On the revenue side, there was
agreement that Ireland’s relatively low levels of business and labor taxes are appropriate,
and that the tax net should be broadened. The authorities noted that a review of propertyrelated tax reliefs is currently underway, and staff observed that a useful way to curtail
these reliefs would be to establish across-the-board limits on allowances. Staff also
suggested preserving the nominal ceiling on mortgage interest tax relief (MITR) and
introducing a property tax. The authorities noted that there are no plans at present to raise
the MITR ceiling, but that the appetite for a property tax is limited, recalling the short-lived
experience with a property tax on high-value homes between 1983 and 1996.
17.
The authorities agreed that further efforts are needed to improve value for
money in the delivery of public services. They noted the introduction of five-year capital
envelopes and the recent publication of guidelines for the appraisal and management of
capital expenditure proposals. While they acknowledged that multi-year envelopes for
current spending would improve predictability and reduce the risk of procyclicality, they
felt that the experience with capital envelopes should be assessed first. Staff also suggested
extending the fiscal projections (currently only three years) to at least five years. Regarding
construction projects, the authorities noted that they intended to increase competition at the
tendering stage and improve contracting arrangements. In health services, they pointed to
progress in the implementation of the government’s reform plan launched in mid-2003,
including the establishment of a single national entity to manage health services, the
modernization of management planning, and the introduction of a plan indicating services
to be delivered and the links between services and staffing.
18.
The authorities disagreed with the staff’s suggestion to automatically index
tax credits and bands and social welfare payments to prices. Staff argued that, because
income tax credits and bands and their interaction with social welfare payments have
important effects on work incentives, changes in their real burdens should be explicit policy
decisions rather than an untransparent side effect of price inflation. Staff also observed that
the current system gives rise to periodic, and thus lumpy, adjustments, which partly
underlies the fiscal stimulus in 2005. The authorities responded that the lack of indexation
provides important room for maneuver, which can be used for consolidation if necessary.
They added that—for consistency—excise rates would also need to be automatically
indexed. Staff recognized that the benefits of fiscal neutrality and reduced risk of
procyclicality need to be weighed against the loss of fiscal discretion, but observed that
most major industrial countries, including Canada, France, the U.K., and the U.S., have
adopted automatic indexation to prices.
19.
Given pressures to raise spending and the softening of the SGP, staff saw a
role for broader third-party assessment of fiscal policy, but the authorities were not
convinced of the merits. The authorities and staff agreed on the need to deepen public
understanding of a number of fiscal issues, including the need to avoid fiscal procyclicality
because it tends to exacerbate pressures on capacity when times are good and to deepen
economic downturns; the desirability of building a fiscal cushion to prepare for risks over

- 16 -

the medium term; and the need to maintain a strong underlying fiscal position so as to help
Ireland face rising age-related spending over the long term. In staff’s view, broader thirdparty assessments would enhance the public debate. This could be done by building on
existing institutions, such as the National Economic and Social Council (which consists of
the social partners and provides the background analysis for the national wage agreements),
or by establishing a new body such as a fiscal council. The authorities agreed on the need to
improve the focus of the public debate, noting the commitment in the 2005 Budget to
expand parliamentary examination of existing budgetary material produced by the
government. In their view, however, the key issue is not the lack of third-party assessment,
observing that several academics and private analysts make their views known, but rather
that the public debate tends to focus on specific budget measures instead of strategic issues.
More generally, they doubted whether Ireland’s budgetary performance points to the need
for major institutional innovations, wondered whether fiscal councils in other countries
have always been effective, and were concerned whether, at least in Ireland, a fiscal council
would not end up providing a venue for special interests.
C. Labor Market and Wage Policy: Need for Wage Moderation
20.
Labor market flexibility in Ireland is relatively good. Rapid employment
growth since the early 1990s has been driven by rising labor force participation, including

by women, and immigration. The decline in the unemployment rate has reflected the rapid
growth of aggregate demand and reforms of the tax and benefit systems (Box 3). The tax
wedge is now one of the lowest among industrial countries. The authorities observed that
Ireland has allowed immigrants from the new EU member states full access to the labor
market, and that immigrants have played a key role in relieving labor shortages.

have been reduced to the lowest level in the OECD and the tax burden on the second
earner in married couples has fallen, improving the incentives for work. In addition, the
introduction of strict enforcement of eligibility for benefits, the reduction in effective
net benefit replacement ratios, the adoption of a system of coordinated wage
negotiations, and various active labor market policies have also contributed to the
activation of the unemployed.

21.
However, with labor costs already high relative to euro area partners, the
authorities and staff agreed that wage moderation is needed to preserve
competitiveness going forward. National wage agreements and public sector benchmarking exercises play important roles in the wage setting process. Regarding the national
wage agreements, social partners (labor unions, employers, and the government) broadly
concurred that the agreements have provided a useful vehicle for developing a common
view of economic prospects, established sensible guidelines for wage increases while
allowing considerable flexibility at the firm level, and preserved peaceful labor relations.

- 18 -

Going forward, the authorities observed that the next wage agreement (to cover 2006–08)
would need to take account of lower expected inflation and lower projected productivity
growth.
22.
The authorities were satisfied with the first public sector benchmarking
exercise, but acknowledged that improvements are needed in the next one. They noted
that the first exercise succeeded in reducing the rigidity of pay relativities across the public
sector and enhancing the delivery of public

argued that efforts to increase awareness of risks—including the central bank’s public
warnings about the eventual rise in interest rates and the more recent roundtable discussions
with heads of financial institutions organized by the central bank and financial regulator—
have helped to cool the housing market. They said that a drop in house prices remains a
possibility, but the banking system could withstand a considerable fall, as shown by the
scenario analysis in the September 2004 Financial Stability Report. They added that only
one tenth of households have debt service burdens greater than 23 percent of disposable
income. The authorities observed that the international diversification of banks’ assets is

increasing, but staff noted that much of this lending is also property-related. The central
bank and financial regulator have established a financial stability committee, which
recently conducted a crisis simulation exercise. The authorities noted that asset-covered
securities provide relatively inexpensive funding for mortgage lenders.
24.
Looking ahead, the authorities noted that the supervisory priorities are to
implement Basel II and further strengthen stress-testing and credit standards. Basel II
requires establishing more risk-based capital requirements. The authorities were satisfied
with the latest stress-testing exercise, but are considering further methodological
improvements, such as incorporating second-round effects, increasing the variety of shocks,
and enhancing the treatment of the realizability of collateral. A recent review of credit
standards at major mortgage lenders found that—while standards are generally good—there
is a need to tighten lending criteria and establish stricter guidelines for credit officers. In the
insurance sector, the authorities are planning to introduce a supervisory regime for
reinsurance companies in late 2005 or early 2006, in line with the EU Reinsurance
Directive.
25.
The authorities agreed that there is room to further strengthen competition in
the financial sector. A recent report commissioned by the Competition Authority found
obstacles to competition in personal current accounts and lending to small- and mediumsized enterprises. The authorities observed that the double stamp duty charge on switching
financial cards has already been removed and that banks have recently agreed to a
voluntary code of behavior on switching current accounts. This voluntary code is now
being reviewed, as are other measures to increase competition. The authorities are reluctant
to eliminate the legal requirement to notify fees on current accounts before they are
satisfied that competition has been improved. In the non-life insurance sector, the
authorities agreed that greater disclosure of information on claims histories by insurers
would facilitate entry and said that they are now addressing practical issues, like the
appropriate level of detail and the precise mechanism for disclosure.

E. Population Aging: How to Encourage Saving for Retirement?
26.
Ireland has already made important progress in preparing for population
aging. The elderly dependency ratio will rise considerably over the coming half century,
but the increase is back-loaded compared to the rest of the euro area. Incentives to keep
older people in the workforce are relatively strong, so that the effective retirement age is
one of the highest among advanced economies. The authorities noted that the pensionable
age in the civil service has recently been increased and that provision of an old-age pension
bonus for those who work beyond 65 is being considered. Staff suggested phasing out the
Retirement Pension, which requires people to effectively stop working in order to be
eligible.

The authorities expressed concern that households are on the whole not saving
enough for retirement. The state-funded old-age pension is relatively frugal compared to
other industrial countries and provides a
flat share of average earnings, which

for the majority of workers. Private

work and many—especially defined40

replacement rates. Despite media

and action, the authorities said that the
take-up of Personal Retirement Saving
S o urc e : OEC D (2003)
Accounts (a tax-favored, flexible vehicle
launched in 2002) has been disappointing. Overall, the Pensions Board cited estimates that,
based on a desired average replacement rate of 65 percent and a number of other
assumptions, the annual saving shortfall is about 5 percent of GNP. The saving shortfall is
especially acute in the middle three quintiles of the income distribution. Staff observed that
households at the peak of their life-cycle earnings have relatively low saving (Box 4).

- 21 -

Box 4. Who Saves in Ireland?
Given the relatively frugal state pension system in Ireland, an important question is whether
households are saving enough for retirement. Using previously untapped microeconomic
data from the Household Budget Surveys, staff analysis shows that households at the peak
of their life-cycle earnings (aged 45–60) have surprisingly low saving rates compared to
other cohorts, though staff find no evidence of a generational saving gap.1 Moreover, young
and poor households appear to save very little. The good news is that booming house prices
do not seem to have reduced saving.

28.
Against this background, a National Pensions Review—due to be completed
later this year—is examining policy options to raise household saving. The authorities
observed that there is no magic bullet: raising the state-funded old-age pension would
involve considerable additional government spending and, hence, higher taxes; making
additional (second pillar) saving mandatory could increase labor costs, imply a government
guarantee, and lead to a race to the bottom in occupational pensions; and encouraging
voluntary saving through greater tax incentives could be costly in terms of foregone
revenue. Indeed, the favorable tax treatment of SSIAs has boosted saving in the form of
SSIAs, but the effect on overall saving is not clear. Staff noted that automatic enrolment
(with an opt-out clause) can be effective in raising voluntary saving, that the fiscal cost of
tax incentives can be reduced by targeting them at lower- and middle-income workers, and
that more effort could be devoted to improving financial education.

- 22 -

While product market reform is well advanced, the authorities said that
better regulation is needed in some sectors to stimulate competition. Ireland compares

Statistics are being improved. National accounts using chain-linked deflators and
including financial intermediation services, a quarterly general government balance, and
annual sectoral financial accounts will be published later this year. The next steps are to
overhaul the earnings data and calculate a production-side estimate of GDP.
III. STAFF APPRAISAL
31.
Economic performance in Ireland has been and continues to be impressive.
Notwithstanding the catch-up in income per capita that has occurred, real GNP growth over
the coming five years is projected to remain the highest among industrial countries. The
unemployment rate is one of the lowest among industrial countries. Inflation is about
2 percent. This impressive performance is due in significant measure to sound economic
policies, including prudent fiscal policy, low taxes on labor and business income, and social
pacts that contribute to wage moderation.
32.
With the economy now in the neighborhood of full employment, continued
rapid growth could give rise to wage pressures and further erode competitiveness. The
unemployment rate is not far from its historical low. Economic growth is likely to be very
strong in the short term, driven by an acceleration in consumption and continued robust
business investment, though—with the cooling of the housing market—residential
investment is expected to decline modestly starting next year. While there are uncertainties

- 23 -

about the economy’s supply potential, the rapid growth of aggregate demand could give
rise to upward pressures on wages, which would undermine external competitiveness. The
housing market is likely headed for a soft landing, but there is a risk of a sharp decline.
33.
The key priorities for fiscal policy are to help relieve potential overheating
and to build a cushion in the event that downside risks materialize. Public debt is low
and fiscal positions have been generally prudent, but the 2005 budget is imparting
considerable fiscal stimulus, which is adding to pressures on capacity constraints. Given
that interest rates are set for the euro area as a whole and Ireland is relatively cyclically
advanced, fiscal policy should help to forestall wage pressures. In the remainder of 2005,
budget execution needs to remain prudent and any revenue windfalls should be fully saved;
in 2006, underlying fiscal adjustment of ½ percent of GDP would be desirable. Fiscal
restraint is also necessary from medium- and long-term perspectives. It is important to build
a fiscal cushion when times are good, such as now, to be prepared in the event that
downside risks materialize. If aggregate demand weakens unexpectedly and abruptly,
automatic stabilizers should be allowed to operate fully and specific measures to prop up
the housing market should be avoided.
34.
Regarding the composition of adjustment, the growth of current spending
should be restrained and the tax base should be broadened. There is a strong case for
moderating the steep escalation in current spending, so as to limit the risk of inefficiencies.
The tax base could usefully be broadened by limiting property-related capital allowances,
preserving the nominal ceiling on mortgage interest tax relief, and introducing a property
tax.
35.
Against the backdrop of spending restraint, further efforts are needed to
improve value for money in the delivery of public services. Five-year envelopes could
be introduced for current spending and fiscal projections could be extended to five years.
Government procurement practices could be improved further, and a focus on quantified
performance targets in all areas of public services could help motivate efficiency gains.
Separately, to improve fiscal neutrality and reduce the risk of procyclicality, it could be
desirable to introduce automatic indexation of tax credits, bands and excise duties, and
social welfare payments to developments in consumer prices.
36.
Development of mechanisms that build public awareness and understanding
of the fiscal issues facing Ireland would be useful. While the conduct of the fiscal policy
in Ireland has been laudable over the years, pressures to raise spending are longstanding
and could increase, and an enhanced public debate could help clarify both short- and longer
term constraints and requirements.
37.
With labor costs already high, keeping wage growth in line with productivity
growth is essential to maintaining competitiveness. Given the slowdown in productivity
growth and the entrenchment of low and stable inflation, there is a strong case for
moderating overall wage increases under both the forthcoming national wage agreement
and the next public sector benchmarking exercise. In addition, the wage agreement needs to
preserve flexibility, given differential productivity developments across firms. The next

- 24 -

benchmarking exercise should avoid putting upward pressure on wages elsewhere in the
economy, continue to promote verifiable modernization in the public sector, and be as
transparent as possible.
38.
In the financial sector, continued efforts are needed to maintain financial
stability. While banking system profitability and capitalization are strong, vulnerabilities
exist, and the authorities’ efforts to increase awareness of risks are thus welcome. Looking
ahead, continued supervisory efforts are essential to limit excessive risk-taking by lenders
and borrowers: stress-testing could be enhanced and conducted more frequently, credit
standards could be strengthened, and it is understood that an interim update on financial
stability issues to complement the Financial Stability Report is currently being planned.
39.
Given concerns that households are on the whole not saving enough for
retirement, the authorities’ further consideration of policy responses is welcome.
Beyond encouraging longer active participation in the labor force, the appropriate role of
government in addressing inadequate household saving depends crucially on the tradeoff
between the risk of forcing some people to save more than they wish and the risk of some
people not saving enough and falling back on the government in the future. In general
terms, the solution should be clearly sustainable over the long run and provide the right
incentives to work and save.
40.
Strengthening competition in the domestic economy is crucial to maintaining
strong productivity growth and external competitiveness. In the banking system, codes
of conduct to promote competition could usefully be extended, with the eventual objective
of removing the regulation of certain fees. In the non-life insurance sector, greater
disclosure of aggregate information on claims histories would be desirable. Better
regulation is also needed in retail and professional services to stimulate competition and
reduce prices.
41.
Timely and reliable statistics are essential to sound economic policymaking.
Work programs to improve earnings data and introduce a production-side estimate of GDP
should be expedited.
42.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12month cycle.

1/ Based on current policies. The staff estimates assume that tax revenues will perform according to the latest SP projections
in 2006–07, but are adjusted for the difference between the government's and staff's growth assumptions. From 2008 onwards,
tax revenues (excluding indirect taxes) are projected using the OECD's estimates of tax elasticities. Expenditure
estimates for 2004 are based on the latest available official information, whereas projections for 2005–07 assume
expenditure to increase at the pace envisaged in the SP (except for interest rate expenditure). Due to different
accounting conventions, the staff's estimates of total revenue and expenditure ratios differ from the Stability Program.

Exchange Arrangement

As of January 1, 1999, the euro became the currency of Ireland and the irrevocably fixed
conversion rate between the euro and the Irish pound is 0.787564. Ireland maintains an
exchange system free of restrictions, other than those in accordance with UN Security
Council resolutions and EU regulations. Those restrictions have been notified to the Fund
under Decision 144—(52/51).
VIII. Article IV Consultations
The discussions for the last Article IV consultation were conducted in Dublin during
July 8–20, 2004. The staff report (Country Report No. 04/348) was considered by the
Executive Board on October 29, 2004 (EBM/04/102). Article IV consultations with
Ireland are currently on the standard 12–month cycle.

APPENDIX II

Ireland: Statistical Issues
Data provision is adequate for surveillance. Ireland is subject to the statistical requirements and
timeliness and reporting standards of Eurostat and the European Central Bank. It has also subscribed
to the Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS).
1.
The consumer price index is published monthly. The weights of the current index, December
2001=100, are based on the 1999–2000 Household Budget Survey and prices updated to December
2001. The weights are updated every 5 years. National accounts are based on constant 1995 prices,
though there are plans to introduce chain-linking in 2005. Quarterly national accounts are currently
published within 3 months of the reference period. Data on employment, earnings, unit wage costs,
and national income and expenditure are available with a 3–7 month lag, but some non-SDDS
series—such as household disposable income—are published with longer lags. There are plans to
introduce sectoral balance sheet data in 2005. Ireland does not have an overall earnings index, but
there are plans to extend the scope and consistency of earnings data.
2.

There are plans to start publishing a quarterly general government balance in 2005.

3.
Quarterly balance of payments data are in line with the Balance of Payments Manual,
5th edition (BPM5), although the historical data start only in 1998. Some discrepancies exist between
exports and imports data from the national accounts and the balance of payments. Data are compiled
by the Central Statistics Office and are based on statistical surveys combined with administrative
data. These data are closely integrated with the compilation of national accounts. An integrated
computer data processing system was introduced in late 2001. The system provides a powerful
prepublication analytical tool.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
IRELAND
Staff Report for the 2005 Article IV Consultation
Supplementary Information
Prepared by the European Department
Approved by Alessandro Leipold and Michael Hadjimichael
September 30, 2005
1.
This supplement reports on recent developments since the staff report was issued.1
These developments support the thrust of the staff appraisal. In particular, with the economy
now in the neighborhood of full employment, continued rapid growth of domestic demand
could give rise to wage pressures and further erode competitiveness. Against this
background, the key policy priorities remain fiscal restraint, to help relieve potential
overheating and to build a cushion in the event that downside risks materialize; wage
moderation, to keep wage growth in line with productivity growth; and continued efforts to
maintain financial stability.
2.
Revisions to national accounts data for 1995–2004 do not alter the general
pattern of economic growth in recent years. The new data incorporate two methodological
improvements: chain-linked deflators and a better measure of financial intermediation
services. Average annual real GDP and real GNP growth rates over the period as a whole are
virtually unchanged, though growth was slightly weaker during the late 1990s boom and
slightly stronger during the downturn of 2001–03. Real GDP growth in 2004 was revised
down to 4½ percent, reflecting a lower contribution from net exports, and a reduction in net
factor income cut real GNP growth to 4 percent.
3.
Domestic demand growth was very strong in the first half of 2005, as anticipated
in the staff report. Private consumption grew by about 5 percent year-on-year, supported by
rapid employment and income growth, and machinery and equipment investment increased
by over 25 percent, reflecting in part purchases of aircraft. However, net exports subtracted
about 2 percentage points from GDP growth, reflecting in part a slowdown in partnercountry growth. House price increases continued to slow, consistent with a soft landing for
the housing market, though private sector credit growth remained very high. Employment
and the labor force grew by about 5 percent year-on-year in the second quarter, reflecting

increases in the working age population—due in part to large net immigration—and in labor
force participation, and the unemployment rate fell slightly over the year to 4¼ percent.
Despite higher oil prices, HICP inflation was steady at about 2 percent, in line with the euro
area average.
4.
While the short-term growth forecast has been revised down, the economic
outlook remains strong. The real GNP growth projection for 2005 has been marked down
by 0.6 percentage points to 4½ percent, reflecting mainly the soft patch in exports in the first
half. Going forward, higher oil prices are expected to dampen household disposable incomes
and corporate profitability, though the strength of consumption and business investment in
the first half of the year have resulted in an upward revision to domestic demand for the year
as a whole. The staff’s new forecast is somewhat below the Department of Finance’s
projection of 5 percent. In 2006, domestic demand is expected to ease slightly, reflecting in
part higher oil prices, and the contribution from net exports to rise slightly, as export growth
returns to trend.
5.
Recent fiscal developments are consistent with a projected general government
deficit of about 1 percent of GDP in 2005. As expected, revenue has continued to exceed
the budget profile, reflecting in particular VAT and excise receipts, stamp duties, and
collections from revenue investigations. Though expenditure has been slightly lower than
projected, staff assume that it will be in line with the budget for the year as a whole. Staff’s
projection is similar to the Department of Finance’s revised forecast, published in September.

1/ Based on current policies. The staff estimates assume that tax revenues will perform according to the latest SP projections
in 2006–07, but are adjusted for the difference between the government's and staff's growth assumptions. From 2008 onwards,
tax revenues (excluding indirect taxes) are projected using the OECD's estimates of tax elasticities. Expenditure
estimates for 2005 are based on the latest available official information, whereas projections for 2006–07 assume
expenditure to increase at the pace envisaged in the SP (except for interest rate expenditure). Due to different
accounting conventions, the staff's estimates of total revenue and expenditure ratios differ from the Stability Programme.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2005 Article IV Consultation with
Ireland
On October 5, 2005, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Ireland.1 1
Background
Macroeconomic performance in Ireland was extraordinary during the 1990s and has remained
impressive in recent years, due in significant measure to good policies. Real GNP growth
averaged 4½ percent in 2003–04, reflecting strong domestic demand and healthy net exports.
Rapid employment growth was supported by sizable immigration. With the appreciation of the
euro since 2002, HICP inflation has fallen to about 2¼ percent. House price appreciation has
continued to slow gradually, but house prices remain high on various measures.
Ireland’s public finances are strong, but fiscal policy has been procyclical in recent years.
Gross public debt is about 30 percent of GDP, among the lowest in the EU; taxes on labor and
business income are relatively low; and the general government fiscal position has been either
close to balance or in surplus since 1996. However, fiscal policy was expansionary during
2001–02, when economic activity was somewhat higher than potential, and contractionary
during 2003–04, when the output gap was negative. The 2005 budget implies considerable
fiscal stimulus, at a time when the economy is widely regarded as being close to full
employment.
Labor market flexibility is Ireland is good, as reflected in rapid employment growth and low
unemployment. This is largely due to reforms of the tax and benefit systems, which has
produced one of the lowest tax wedges among industrial countries. However, labor costs are
11

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

-2high compared to euro area partners. National wage agreements and public sector
benchmarking exercises play important roles in the wage setting process.
Banking system profitability and capitalization are strong, and nonperforming loans are low.
However, vulnerabilities exist: credit growth—while slowing—remains high, property-related
lending accounts for more than half of the stock of bank lending, and net interest margins have
declined as reliance on more expensive wholesale funding has increased. Household debt has
risen sharply and amounted to 120 percent of disposable income at end-2004.
The elderly dependency ratio in Ireland will rise considerably over the coming half century,
though the increase is back-loaded compared to the rest of the euro area. Incentives to keep
older people in the workforce are relatively strong, so that the effective retirement age is one of
the highest among industrial countries. The state-funded old-age pension provides a flat share
of average earnings, which helps the elderly avoid poverty but provides only a low
replacement rate for the majority of workers.
Executive Board Assessment
The Executive Directors commended Ireland’s continued impressive economic performance,
the result of sound economic policies, including prudent fiscal policy, low taxes on labor and
business income, and wage moderation. Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to keep
these policies in place, allowing Ireland to maintain its competitiveness and sustain its
remarkable performance going forward.
Directors expected economic growth to be strong in the short term, driven by an acceleration
of consumption and continued robust business investment, though—with the gradual cooling
of the housing market—residential investment will likely decline modestly starting next year.
The main risks to the outlook are a further rise in oil prices, an abrupt slowdown in global
growth, and a sharp decline in the housing market. While acknowledging uncertainties about
supply potential, Directors viewed the economy as now being close to full employment. With
inflation projected to rise next year, rapid growth of aggregate demand could give rise to wage
pressures, which would undermine external competitiveness, especially as labor costs are
already high.
Directors welcomed Ireland’s low level of public debt and generally prudent fiscal policy.
However, they noted that the 2005 budget is imparting considerable fiscal stimulus, adding to
cyclical pressures. With euro area monetary policy very accommodative from Ireland’s
perspective, fiscal policy needs to help relieve potential overheating. Directors called for
prudent budget execution and saving any revenue windfalls in the remainder of 2005, and for
underlying fiscal tightening in 2006, in line with the authorities’ medium-term fiscal objective of
close to balance or surplus. In addition, Directors underscored the importance of building a
fiscal cushion in good times, such as now, in the event that downside risks materialize. If
aggregate demand were to weaken abruptly, Directors agreed that automatic stabilizers
should be allowed to operate fully and that specific measures to prop up the housing market
should be avoided.
Regarding the composition of fiscal adjustment, Directors recommended that the growth of
current spending be restrained and that the tax base be broadened. Moderating the steep
escalation in current spending would limit the risk of inefficiencies. The tax base could be

-3broadened by limiting property-related capital allowances, preserving the nominal ceiling on
mortgage interest tax relief, and introducing a property tax.
Directors supported the authorities’ objective of improving value for money in the delivery of
public services. They suggested that five-year envelopes could be introduced for current
spending, that fiscal projections could be extended to five years, that government procurement
practices could be strengthened further, and that a focus on quantified performance targets
could help motivate efficiency gains. Separately, Directors noted that—to improve fiscal
neutrality and reduce the risk of procyclical fiscal policy—it could be desirable to introduce
automatic indexation of tax credits and bands, excise duties, and social welfare payments to
developments in consumer prices.
While the conduct of fiscal policy in Ireland has been laudable over the years, Directors shared
the authorities’ view that it would be useful to deepen public understanding of fiscal issues. As
pressures to raise spending are longstanding and could increase, an enhanced public debate
could help clarify both short- and longer term constraints and requirements. However, many
Directors did not see a case in Ireland’s circumstances for the creation of a fiscal council to
provide third-party assessments.
Directors commended the openness and flexibility of Ireland’s labor market, and the low labor
tax wedge, which have enabled Ireland to benefit from enhanced intra-EU labor mobility and
contributed to faster growth and low unemployment. They underscored that keeping wages in
line with productivity is essential to maintaining competitiveness, noting that wages are high
relative to those in the euro area. With the slowdown in productivity growth and the
entrenchment of low and stable inflation, Directors recommended that wage increases under
the forthcoming national wage agreement and the next public sector benchmarking exercise
be moderate. In addition, Directors noted that the wage agreement needs to preserve
flexibility, given differential productivity developments across firms, and that the next
benchmarking exercise should be as transparent as possible, continue to promote verifiable
modernization in the public sector, and avoid putting upward pressure on wages elsewhere in
the economy.
While recognizing the banking system’s strong profitability and capitalization, Directors noted
that vulnerabilities exist and therefore welcomed the authorities’ efforts to increase awareness
of risks. They highlighted, in particular, the need to monitor carefully trends in the housing
market, given the high exposure of banks to this market. Directors underscored that continued
supervisory efforts are essential to limit excessive risk-taking by lenders and borrowers: stresstesting could be enhanced and conducted more frequently, credit standards could be
strengthened, and interim updates to the Financial Stability Report could be prepared.
Directors welcomed the FSAP update planned for 2006.
Directors considered Ireland well placed to cope with the fiscal impact of population ageing,
given the low debt ratio and the accumulation of reserves in the National Pensions Reserve
Fund. Nevertheless, they shared the concern that households are on the whole not saving
enough for retirement, and welcomed the authorities’ consideration of further policy responses.
Directors noted that Ireland’s effective retirement age is one of the highest among
industrialized countries, and concurred that encouraging longer active participation in the labor
force is important. Beyond that, the appropriate role of government in addressing inadequate
household saving depends crucially on the tradeoff between the risk of forcing some people to

-4save more than they wish and the risk of some people not saving enough and falling back on
the government in the future. In general terms, the solution should be clearly sustainable over
the long run and provide the right incentives to work and save.
Directors agreed that strengthening competition in the domestic economy is crucial to
maintaining strong productivity growth and external competitiveness. In the banking system,
codes of conduct to promote competition could usefully be extended, with the eventual
objective of removing the regulation of certain fees. In the non-life insurance sector, greater
disclosure of aggregate information on claims histories would be desirable. Better regulation is
also needed in retail and professional services to stimulate competition and reduce prices.
Directors encouraged the authorities to continue their efforts to improve the timeliness and
reliability of statistics.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.
