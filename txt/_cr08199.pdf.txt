JAMAICA
Staff Report for the 2008 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2008 Consultation with Jamaica
Approved by Ranjit Teja and Matthew Fisher
April 3, 2008

• Context. Jamaica has been under intensified Fund surveillance since 2004. The new
administration, which in September 2007 replaced the outgoing government of
18 years, intends to continue this arrangement. Intensified surveillance has focused on
helping improve the fiscal and debt profiles. Macroeconomic outcomes have generally
fallen short of the authorities’ objectives in recent years.
• Developments. Economic growth weakened, inflation accelerated and balance of
payments pressures emerged in 2007. The budget deficit target was revised upwards
and reserves declined.
• Key policy recommendations. A weakened global economy and increased financial
volatility add to the ongoing policy challenges presented by high public debt:
¾ Reduce the public debt/GDP ratio to about 100 percent of GDP over five years by
raising the primary surplus gradually by 4–4½ percentage points of GDP over the
same period. Begin the process with a strong adjustment of over 1 percent of GDP
in the fiscal year starting in April 2008.
¾ Tighten monetary policy moderately to stem reserve losses and reduce inflation
but let the Jamaican dollar find its level if pressures persist.
¾ Close fraudulent investment schemes, many of which resemble pyramid or Ponzi
schemes and could have important macroeconomic spillovers. Improve information
on, and supervision over, financial conglomerates, including in a regional context.
• Authorities’ reactions. An ambitious medium-term program of fiscal adjustment and
structural reforms will reduce debt but its implementation requires time. A broadly
unchanged primary surplus in FY 2008/09 is more realistic. Achieving such a target
will help build credibility, which could be hurt by over reaching with excessively
ambitious objectives at the outset of the program. Recent increases in interest rates
have helped reserves recover and the central bank stands ready to take further action,
as warranted.
• Mission. The team visiting Jamaica during March 3–14 comprised Messrs. Panth
(Head), Guerson, and Faircloth (all WHD); and Ms. Li (PDR). Executive Director Fried
and Ms. Morgan (OED) participated in the final discussions.

I. BACKGROUND
1.
Jamaica has long struggled with low economic growth and high public debt.
Annual real GDP growth has averaged only 1 percent since 1991. Public debt increased
substantially after a banking crisis in the mid-1990s and currently stands at 128 percent of
GDP, despite a program adopted in 2004 to reduce it to around 100 percent of GDP by 2009.

Economic growth variability is, however, low
in Jamaica, with deviations driven more by weather
than by external conditions. Since 1993, Jamaica has
not grown faster than 2½ percent. On the other hand, the
economy has not shrunk on a year-to-year basis either,
except during 1997–98 when annual contractions were
limited to 1¼ percent. What variability there is in growth
appears due to natural disasters. Simple growth
correlations with the rest of the Caribbean, Latin America
and the United States for 1991–2006 are statistically
insignificant.

Current Account Deficit

3.
External developments do, nevertheless, have
large financial implications for Jamaica. Jamaica has a
relatively narrow export base, is very dependent on energy
imports and relies heavily on remittances and external
market financing. Both in terms of its current account
deficit and debt, Jamaica is exceptionally exposed to the
vicissitudes of global economic and financial market
conditions and sentiments.

Developments in Jamaica can, in turn, have a
significant influence in the wider Caribbean. Jamaica
has the second-largest economy in the Caribbean
community (CARICOM). Largely the same set of banks,
security dealers and insurance companies operate in these

countries. Moreover, the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) adopted a common market this
year and is committed to creating a single economic space by 2015. The potential for
regional spillovers from Jamaica that already exists can, therefore, be expected to grow
further with regional integration.
5.
A recent political transition provides an opportunity to reinvigorate reforms but
success will require consensus across the political divide. In September, the Jamaica
Labour Party (JLP) formed a new government, following a narrow electoral victory over the
People’s National Party (PNP), which had continuously held office for 18 years. However,
many of the reforms necessary to ensure durable debt reduction are politically difficult and
will require broad national support to implement.
6.
The new administration’s program to tackle Jamaica’s challenges is being cast
in an environment that has notably worsened.
•

Economic growth likely slowed to 1 percent in FY 2007/08 (ending in March),
while inflation has surged to 18 percent in recent months. While food and fuel
prices explain most of the increase, core inflation has also reached double digits
(Box 1).

•

Unregulated investment schemes promising implausibly high returns in excess of
10 percent per month have proliferated. These schemes have the potential to cause
social and macroeconomic instability and hurt the financial sector.

•

Reserves declined sharply in 2007 before recovering more recently. The pressures
on the exchange rate are due to both a widened current account deficit and capital
outflows (see Box 1).

•

Going forward, the deteriorating external environment could have budgetary
costs. Revenues from tourism and bauxite exports may be at risk in the slowed global
economy, while the global credit crunch and repricing of risk could increase debt
service costs (Box 2).

7.
As in other countries with very high debt, Jamaica’s public finances severely
limit the room for policy maneuverability. Jamaica’s situation has many similarities, but
also important differences, with other high debt, middle-income countries, such as Lebanon
(Figure 1). Both countries have maintained macroeconomic stability for an extended period
despite their persistently high public debt levels (134 percent of GDP in Jamaica, 177 percent
of GDP in Lebanon in 2006). An important factor in this regard has been the ability of both
countries to rely on the domestic financial system for much of the government’s financing
needs. The resulting dependence has, however, also created systemic risks, in that shocks to
either the government or the financial sector could quickly transmit to the other and on to the
broader economy. Lebanon has a fixed peg, which is credited with helping to maintain
financial stability. Jamaica has a flexible exchange rate that has helped to adjust to shocks.

5

Box 1. Jamaica: Economic Developments in FY 2007/08
Exogenous developments led to weaker growth, higher inflation and a wider current account deficit. On the
policy front, the original budget deficit target was revised upwards and interest rates were increased following
large reserve losses.
40

•

•

•

Natural disasters mainly explain the fall in real GDP
growth by 1½ percent over FY 2006/07. Hurricane Dean
and floods caused extensive damage to agriculture. Also,
there was a reversal of the one-off increase in tourists
diverted from hurricane-affected Mexican destinations in
2006.
The recent surge in headline annual inflation is due to
supply shocks. Dean added to pressures from rising global
food prices. Inflation also accelerated from higher fuel import
costs, which are fully passed through to consumers. Some
second-round effects of these price changes, as well as a
quickened pace of exchange rate depreciation, led to an
upward drift in core inflation to 11¾ percent by January
2008.
Reserves fell by about a fifth during June–November
2007, due to a combination of external and domestic
factors:
¾ Weak export growth and rising import prices lie
behind the widening of the current account deficit by
3¾ percentage points to 15½ percent of GDP. Food
export growth slowed sharply in tandem with the slowing
of agricultural production, while bauxite exports suffered
from capacity constraints. The net energy import bill,
however, rose to 14 percent of GDP, from 12 percent in
2006.
¾ Global market turbulence contributed to capital
outflows. Global increases in emerging market debt
spreads reduced the local currency yield premium on
Jamaica’s domestic debt (in comparison to its Eurobonds),
encouraging a portfolio shift away from Jamaican-dollar
instruments. While hard data is absent, some of the
outflows could also be related to unregulated investment
schemes (see Box 4).

inherited spending commitments outside of the budget
also contributed to market unease. The new authorities
subsequently presented revised comprehensive estimates to parliament that projected a widening of the
FY 2007/08 budget deficit by 1½ percent of GDP after allowing also for some new spending initiatives
as well as nonprogrammed revenues.
•

The pressures on the exchange rate led the central bank to increase interest rates by 220 basis points
in early 2008, which has helped reserves recover recently. About half of the reserve loss during June–
November has been reversed in recent weeks following increases in six-month interest rates to 14.2 percent
and the external sale of a large private Jamaican enterprise.

Box 2. Jamaica: Impact of External Economic Slowdowns and Credit Crunches
A look at the historical data shows that the impact of U.S. macroeconomic stress is: (1) small on GDP but
(2) larger on the budget, exports, and capital flows.
• U.S. slowdowns have been associated with a worsening
of the primary fiscal balance in Jamaica but have not
had a very significant economic growth impact.
Revenues that are tourism and bauxite-export based would
be adversely affected by a U.S. slowdown as would
customs receipts. The data suggests that this fiscal counter
cyclicality has extended to expenditures. Jamaica’s
growth has, however, not been volatile and the impact of
slowdowns in the United States may have been further
limited by the countercyclical fiscal policies.
• Slowdowns in U.S. GDP growth or credit crunches
have, however, been associated with a persistent
reduction of capital inflows. An econometric model
suggests that a two-standard reduction in U.S. GDP
growth, followed by a return to trend levels, has led to
declines in capital inflows into Jamaica by about
US$170 million, on average, cumulatively over a fiveyear period. If the subsequent rebound in the U.S. is
only to earlier trend rates (rather than levels), the decline
in capital inflows into Jamaica almost doubles to
US$300 million (a sixth of reserves). Lower credit
growth in the United States has had a similar but even
larger impact on capital flows.
• The same model predicts that while export receipts
and remittances can decline sharply, the impact on the
overall current account balance is likely to be small, if
any. This is because much of Jamaica’s imports are for
tourists and would decrease with tourism receipts. Also, a
large share of the remittances pay for imported consumer
goods by otherwise financially-constrained individuals.
Finally, U.S. growth slowdowns have usually led to lower
prices for petroleum, a major import for Jamaica.

global financial integration, financial flows may be affected
even more now—indeed, the transmission of the U.S.
subprime debacle to other financial systems is unprecedented and unpredictable. Third, and most
fundamentally, because they treat policies as endogenous, the models do not allow for policy changes to affect
predicted outcomes.

II. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
8.
Given the vulnerabilities in public finances and the financial system, the
discussions focused on four key questions.
•

How can growth be invigorated?

•

What is the appropriate path, pace and means for debt reduction?

•

How can monetary and exchange rate policy help ensure macroeconomic stability in a
period of weakening external demand and increased financial volatility?

•

How can financial sector risks be contained in Jamaica and in the region?
A. Economic Growth

9.
The authorities are keenly aware that increasing growth has to be part and
parcel of the debt reduction strategy. Recognizing that the causality between growth and
debt runs in both directions, they hope to bring about a virtuous cycle of lower debt and
higher growth by simultaneously tackling both the debt problem and the investment climate.
10.
The persistence of low growth in Jamaica is partly a result of resource
misallocation caused by high debt. Overall, investment rates are high. In particular,
Jamaica has been relatively successful in attracting foreign investment in tourism and
bauxite, which, however, are largely shielded from Jamaica-specific risks and have limited
backward linkages. Therefore, the “debt overhang” appears not so much to have reduced
investment, the usual channel through which debt affects growth, but rather skewed it
towards safer but lower-return activities and industries. Cross-country data show such a

9

negative relationship between total factor productivity and debt (Figure 2). Furthermore,
given the complementarity between public and private investment, countries with very low
public investment, such as Jamaica, appear to grow more slowly, even if private investment
remains high.
11.
The authorities plan to improve the investment climate. They intend to simplify
investment procedures, including those related to land purchases; consolidate and streamline
other regulatory requirements; and increase efficiency through privatization. With a view to
eliminating duplicate functions and institutions, the authorities are also planning to
rationalize Jamaica’s over 100 off-budget public entities. The rationalization plan will
identify entities that can be merged and those that are to be wound up. Furthermore, tax
reform that addresses investors’ concerns features prominently in the authorities’ agenda.
According to the World Bank’s Doing Business survey (2008), Jamaica currently ranks 170
out of 178 countries in the difficulties associated with paying taxes because of the
complexities of the system and the onerous paperwork.
12.
Growth should gradually pick up over the medium term as the reforms yield
fruit. Growth is likely to rebound in 2008 to 2¾ percent (broadly in line with the outturn in
2006), particularly if there is no further hurricane damage. However, permanently ratcheting
it upwards will require time for the structural reforms as well as debt reduction to take hold.
With reforms, growth could eventually reach 3½ percent.
B. Debt Dynamics and Fiscal Policy
13.
The authorities emphasized that they remain firmly committed to honoring
Jamaica’s contractual obligations. They recognize the benefits, in terms of market access
and reduced borrowing costs that Jamaica’s untarnished record of meeting payments brings.
14.
Lowering debt will, therefore, require fiscal adjustment. The authorities have
approached the United Kingdom to lead an international effort to relieve the debt burden of
lower middle-income countries like Jamaica and also asked the World Bank to explore ways
to help with the debt. However, any official relief will require substantial time, given the
absence of clear precedents. Furthermore, as multilateral and bilateral debt accounts for
under 10 percent of the total, the scope for official assistance alone to ease the debt is limited.
Thus, while increasing growth will pay dividends over the longer-term, fiscal consolidation
will have to remain an integral element of the debt reduction agenda over the medium term.
15.
The authorities aim to balance the budget over a three-year period, which could
pave the way to reducing debt to about 100 percent of GDP by 2013. The
authorities’current plans imply improving the primary surplus by 3½ percent of GDP
between now and 2010. With further fiscal consolidation of 1 percent of GDP during 2011–
13, debt could come down to around 100 percent of GDP by FY 2012/13 without any official
debt relief (Tables 1–4). However, the implementation of such an adjustment plan does not,
by itself, guarantee the desired debt outcome. In particular, if past trends (shocks as well as
policy weaknesses) persist, there is only about a 50-percent probability of debt falling below

The risks and uncertainties in reaching the debt target have arisen, in significant
part, from shocks to financial and fiscal variables. For example, weakened investor
confidence in 2003 led to a sharp drop in the exchange rate and a higher debt-to-GDP ratio.
Similarly, fiscal revenues are sensitive to external developments—more so than GDP (see
Box 2). And, frequent natural disasters, for which no contingencies are built in, have led to
expenditure overruns.

To address some of the fiscal management issues, the authorities are considering
adopting fiscal responsibility legislation but other steps are also needed. Codifying good
budget management practice is useful but in the mission’s view, it will be equally important
to retain fiscal flexibility in a shock-prone economy like Jamaica’s. Furthermore, given the

12
frequent deviations from targets and revision of accounts, the capability to monitor and
enforce a fiscal responsibility law needs to be built. It may be helpful to prepare first a fiscal
ROSC to identify specific necessary reforms. Similarly, given the increases in debt due to
off-budget entities, it is important to enhance the capacity to assess fiscal risk from public
enterprises and monitor fiscal policy at the general government level. Strengthened debt
management can also assist the authorities’ debt reduction effort as can limiting use of
PetroCaribe savings by off-budget entities and using them instead to substitute for more
expensive central government debt.
19.
The authorities’ planned revenue and public enterprise reforms will help reduce
debt over the long term. The tax reforms (paragraph 11), while primarily aimed at
simplifying the system, are expected to increase tax collections, as are ongoing efforts
supported by the Fund and CARTAC to strengthen tax administration. With Fund TA, the
authorities are also planning to review tax exemptions. Furthermore, privatizing loss-makers,
in particular Air Jamaica and the Sugar Company, will limit off-budget debt creation, which
has been significant in recent years.
20.
Even with these initiatives, however, expenditure measures will be needed.
Nonwage primary expenditures have increased by 4 percent of GDP in the last two years.
Also, the past practice of seeking temporary wage freezes from unions in return for a
commitment not to retrench has proved
14
unsustainable, with the wage bill rebounding upon

21.
It will be important to make a strong start with the fiscal adjustment. In
particular, raising the primary surplus by around 1–1½ percent of GDP in FY 2008/09 can
help build credibility and smooth the adjustment profile. Furthermore, in the current context
of rising inflation and a widening current account deficit, fiscal consolidation would help the
BOJ maintain stability and safeguard reserves. Rolling back now the increases in spending
associated with the Cricket World Cup in FY 2006/07 and elections the following year has,
in particular, the merit of making the adjustment more durable.
22.
The authorities, however, do not see scope for a significant adjustment until
FY 2009/10. The FY 2008/09 budget is still being formulated but the authorities do not
consider it feasible to undertake significant expenditure reductions currently. The primary
surplus (according to Fund staff definitions) is expected to remain broadly unchanged in
FY 2008/09 (see Table 5). The authorities stress the need for investment and other progrowth spending initiatives in the new budget. Furthermore, they point out that designing and

13
implementing comprehensive reforms will necessarily require time. Noting the repeated
deviations from budget targets in the past, they feel it more important, in terms of gaining
credibility, to aim for a realistic budget target and achieve it than to be more ambitious and
disappoint expectations.
C. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
23.
The key challenge currently is to stem capital outflows and reduce external
vulnerabilities more generally while maintaining internal balance. Reserve losses cannot
be sustained indefinitely. The staff’s balance of payments projections assume that a
significant portion of the government’s external debt service falling due in FY 2008/09 is
refinanced through new borrowing. To the extent that this does not take place, reserve losses
would be even larger —the authorities could usefully develop contingency plans to deal with
any rollover pressures. Also, missing data on private sector obligations argues for caution in
determining the appropriate level of reserves to target and adds urgency to reduce the current
account deficit and stem capital outflows.
24.
Fiscal and financial sector considerations, however, pose constraints on the
policy choice set. Interest rate hikes will weaken financial institutions; in particular, security
dealers holding fixed-rate debt. Monetary tightening also imposes greater debt-service costs
on the budget, especially given the shift in debt management practices in recent years toward
favoring variable rate instruments. On the other hand, currency depreciation can fuel inflation
and increases the debt-to-GDP ratio.
25.
A moderate interest rate increase is advisable, while letting the Jamaican dollar
find its level in the face of pressures. The recent period of stability in the foreign exchange
market appears related, in part, to the inflows associated with the external sale of a major
private enterprise, and so could be temporary. With the recent reduction of interest rates in
the United States, a further moderate tightening in Jamaica may, in the end, suffice to contain
further capital outflows and moderate inflation. At the same time, however, the current value
of the Jamaican dollar is not far from its equilibrium, limiting the likelihood of a sustained
fall in the exchange rate (Box 3). The greater durability of the fiscal deficit to exchange rate
movements than to interest rate changes also argues against an unduly costly defense of the
exchange rate.
26.
The authorities stand ready to increase interest rates further if conditions
warrant. They emphasized that relative to the United States, where short-term interest rates
have been declining, their stance already embodies significant tightening. Furthermore, they
consider the recent interest rate hikes in Jamaica and brief nominal appreciation in December
as signals of their readiness to flexibly use all of their instruments, in both directions, to
achieve their policy objectives. They note, however, the need to keep in mind that sharp
movements in the exchange rate have significant costs in a small open economy. The public,
in particular, remains wary of financial volatility, as reflected in the low level of
monetization in Jamaica.

14

Box 3. Jamaica: Exchange Rate Assessment
Jamaica’s exchange rate regime is a managed float. The current level of the real effective exchange rate
(REER) in Jamaica is broadly in line with fundamentals.
• The current level of the real exchange rate is, within a margin of error, in line with the equilibrium.
Applying to Jamaica the coefficients of a cross-country cross-time study by the Fund’s Consultative Group
on Exchange Rate Issues (CGER), the REER was about 6½ percent above the equilibrium in 2007, within
the standard forecast error of 12 percent. The CGER, however, did not include Jamaica in its sample, or
explicitly account for tourism-related productivity differentials and terms of trade— both of which a model
estimated by Cashin and Pineda (2008) that also includes Jamaica in the sample does. Coefficients from the
latter study suggest Jamaica’s REER is 2 percent above the equilibrium.

1/ Bands are the confidence intervals at the 90
percent level of confidence.

• The current account deficit is expected to fall to its equilibrium level over the medium term. Its level
now reflects the impact of shocks, which the economy is in the process of adjusting to. Again, using the
coefficients from the CGER exercise, Jamaica’s expected 2012/13 current account deficit is in line with the
calculated equilibrium of 7 percent of GDP. Cashin and Pineda confirm this finding in their sample.
• Competitiveness indicators suggest the level of the exchange rate is appropriate. Jamaica’s market
share of Caribbean tourism has been increasing and a manufacturing unit-labor-cost-based measure of the
real exchange rate has been broadly stable, despite the recorded decline in manufacturing exports.

D. Financial Sector
27.
Notwithstanding the generally positive bank soundness indicators, the financial
system is at risk, including from unregulated investment schemes. Households have
reportedly borrowed, in part, from banks to fund investments in these schemes. In this
context, near 30-percent annual increases in bank credit growth are worrisome. The
authorities note, however, that the collateral underlying bank credit to investors should limit
risks to the financial system.

28.
The authorities have requested Fund technical assistance to strengthen the legal
and regulatory framework for unregulated schemes. The Financial Services Commission
(FSC) has issued cease and desist orders to some entities, which has met with a series of
court challenges. The authorities want to adapt international best practice to prevent schemes
that are not in the public interest, while ensuring that legitimate investments can proceed
(Box 4). Consistent with this request, the TA mission has recommended that the authorities
focus on actions to prevent the flow of new money and safeguard already-invested funds in
the schemes; adopt a regulatory framework for private investment clubs; and, strengthen
existing regulations and enforcement powers.
29.
The weaker environment highlights the importance of addressing potential blind
spots in financial sector monitoring and supervision. Analytical information to quantify a
variety of market risks for security dealers is limited—absence of information on external
borrowings is particularly worrisome, given the risks of margin calls. Risks could also
transmit from dealers to banks (or vice versa) in conglomerates that comprise both banks and
dealers. However, the current segmented supervisory structure (between the BOJ and the
FSC); gaps in apportioning responsibilities across supervisory agencies; and, insufficient
technical collaborations risk creating supervisory gaps for the system as a whole.
30.
Strengthening supervision is also a regional priority. Unregulated investment
schemes operating out of Jamaica are reportedly active elsewhere in the Caribbean.
Furthermore, the same set of financial conglomerates dominate the Caribbean (Figure 3)

16

Box 4. Jamaica: Unregulated Investment Schemes and the Macroeconomy
• There are currently over 35 unregulated alternative investment schemes. The Caribbean
Policy Research Institute (CAPRI), an independent think-tank, estimates that total investments in
the schemes amount to 12½–25 percent of GDP.
• The schemes have common characteristics: (i) promised monthly returns of at least 10 percent;
(ii) restrictions on withdrawals; and (iii) referrals of new members by existing clients.
• These attributes, however, are also common to Ponzi schemes, which inevitably collapse.

months of the scheme’s operation are fully rolled over.

• The macroeconomic impact is difficult
to discern but could be significant. On the surface, the schemes do not appear to be causing
banking disintermediation as deposit and credit growth have been robust recently. Furthermore,
following a 9 percent shift from household deposits to enterprises (which the schemes are likely to
be classified as by individual banks) during 2001–05, deposit shares have remained broadly stable.
Security dealers, however, do report losing customers to the schemes (analytical data on dealers is
lacking). Indeed, to shield themselves from a possible freeze of their assets, the schemes could be
exporting funds under their management abroad, which would be consistent with the weakening of
the exchange rate and reserve losses. In the balance of payments, net unidentified private inflows
are estimated to have decreased by US$0.6 billion in FY 2007–08. The counterpart to the loss of
reserves could be security dealers’ liabilities to the public (rather than banks’ liabilities), which are
not included in the monetary survey.
• The schemes could have larger macroeconomic implications in future. The collapse of
pyramid schemes equivalent to about 50 percent of GDP in Albania in the late 1990s led to a sharp
depreciation and increased inflation, as well as a large-scale civil disorder and a 2 percentage point
fall in output. CAPRI considers the risk of social unrest limited in Jamaica because investors are
middle-to-high income and appear aware of the risks. A collapse in personal wealth can,
nevertheless impact on GDP. Assuming, for example, that the wealth effect on consumption is in
the range of 3 to 6 percent and the marginal propensity to consume is 0.7 (broadly similar to the
United States), the full loss of investments could reduce output by about 2¼–4½ percent of GDP.

and with regional integration, are likely to become organized less along purely jurisdictional
lines. Regional supervisors will, therefore, be challenged to ensure that blind zones that can
let shocks spread easily from one Caribbean country to another do not emerge.
III. STAFF APPRAISAL
31.
The new authorities have ambitious plans to address the policy imperatives they
inherited along with a much more difficult environment. Jamaica’s disappointing highdebt and low-growth experience accentuates the hazards it now faces in a world where
growth in the United States, its largest economic partner, has slowed; lending risks have been
repriced; and credit conditions have tightened. The new authorities are keenly aware that
under these circumstances, securing continued economic stability and placing Jamaica on an
improved growth trajectory require steadfast commitment to debt reduction. They also
recognize the importance of taking difficult monetary and exchange rate policy actions when
necessary, and strengthening financial sector resilience.
32.
The broad nature of the authorities’ debt and fiscal agenda is welcome and fiscal
adjustment plans should be fleshed out. A multiplicity of factors has helped perpetuate the
debt problem in the past; ranging from weaknesses in assigning fiscal responsibility to poor
budget design, execution and monitoring; from financially hemorrhaging public enterprises
to faustian wage bargains that neither yielded efficiency nor allowed public workers always
to be paid adequately; from a grossly inefficient tax system to insufficiently transparent fiscal
accounting practices. The new authorities have indicated that they are planning to address
these issues. They have also underscored their intention to pursue a broader structural reform
agenda, strengthen government effectiveness, and eliminate the budget deficit over the
medium-term—to that end, it would be important to identify specific measures to increase
revenues and reduce spending.
33.
The authorities’ commitments to monetary and exchange rate flexibility and to
addressing unregulated investment schemes are encouraging. The use of all of its tools
can help the central bank navigate through the current external turbulence and rising
domestic price pressures. As regards the financial sector, ensuring that the core remains
sound and limiting fraudulent activities, which could have important macroeconomic
spillovers, are always important, but they could be critical now in the changed environment.
34.
The priority now is for the government to give concrete shape to all its
initiatives. The broad and ambitious character of the government’s plans are appropriate,
given the nature and scale of Jamaica’s economic challenges. This same large scope of the
plans, however, means that they have not all been fully fleshed out yet. The official
international community can help provide appropriate technical and financial assistance as
the authorities build domestic consensus behind their initiatives. The authorities will,
however, also have to remain mindful that financial markets will be keenly monitoring the
demonstration not only of their policy intentions, but also of the implementation.
35.
Striking the right balance between realism and ambition remains key. A strong
fiscal adjustment effort now, along with publicizing a comprehensive economic legislative
agenda and timetable would be reassuring. They would reinforce the seriousness the

19
authorities attach to their plans. Improving the fiscal primary surplus by 1–1½ percent of
GDP now would also demonstrate Jamaica’s capacity to adjust rapidly to a deteriorating
external environment, so as to ensure continued macroeconomic stability. The authorities are,
however, also right in that realism in setting budget targets is important to dispel the past
record of missed objectives.
36.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard
12-month cycle.

Sources: Jamaican authorities, Fund staff estimates and projections.
1/ Central government debt including debt assumed from public entities, plus public guaranteed debt, plus PetroCaribe debt.
Cash-flow savings from the PetroCaribe agreement with Venezuela are managed by an extrabudgetary fund that lends to both budgetary
and off-budget entities.
2/ In 2008/09 includes a projected debt takeover from the Sugar Company of Jamaica amounting to J$11.7 billion. Starting in 2009/10 includes
annually 0.3 percent of GDP for contingencies and assumed domestic debts.
3/ Total PetroCaribe lending to the central government amounts to 1.2 percent of GDP (including project lending and holdings of government bonds).
A consolidation of Petrocaribe and central government debt would result in a debt-to-GDP ratio estimate as of end of FY 2007/08 of 127.1 percent.
The projections do not incorporate any assumptions about further lending to the central government by the Petrocaribe Fund.

Adjustments to primary balance 2/
Authorities' primary balance presentation

plus consolidated fund
plus PetroCaribe
plus debt takeovers
IMF primary balance presentation
Memorandum item:
GDP, in J$ billion

1/ Interest payments to the BoJ paid with government securities are recorded at the time of the securities' issuance.
Starting in 2008/09, the government pays interest to the BoJ concurrently, as opposed to through debt issuance the following
fiscal year. This results in two interest payments to the BoJ in 2008/09 in the IMF presentation.
2/ In the IMF presentation, expenditures are recorded in the year of execution. The authorities' presentation includes
expenditures executed in earlier fiscal years. For FY 2007/08, such amounts are J$12.5 billion; for FY 2008/09, such
amounts are J$0.8 billion; and in FY 2009/10, such amounts are J$0.4 billion.

Projections
Debt-stabilizing
2007/08 2008/09 2009/10 2010/11 2011/12 2012/13 primary balance 9/

1/ Central government and government guaranteed debt on gross basis. From FY 2002/03, includes debt issued to the BoJ to cover its cash losses and related capitalized interest. FY 2006/07 debt
includes US$350 million in prefinancing. The primary balance includes budgetary primary balance and off-budget expenditure. Dynamics do not drive guaranteed debt. PetroCaribe debt treated as
guaranteed debt in this analysis.
2/ Derived as [(r - p(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; p = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; a = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as ae(1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP. Guaranteed debt added for presentational purposes.
8/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.

Real GDP growth (in percent)
Average nominal interest rate on public debt (in percent) 8/
Average real interest rate (nominal rate minus change in GDP deflator, in percent)
Nominal appreciation (increase in U.S. dollar value of local currency, in percent)

IX. Exchange Rate Arrangements:
The external value of the Jamaican dollar has been determined in an interbank market
operated by commercial banks beginning September 17, 1990. The Jamaican dollar has
depreciated significantly since then, though not in a uniform trend. At January 31, 2008 it
was trading at around J$71½ to the U.S. dollar.

Last Article IV Consultation and Program Relations:

Jamaica is under intensified surveillance whereby staff monitors the implementation of the
economic strategy formulated by the authorities without reaching prior understandings with
the Fund. The last Article IV consultation was completed by the Executive Board on
April 30, 2007 (Country Report No. 07/152). Interim staff reports are prepared for
information of the Executive Board in-between Article IV consultations (Country Report
No. 06/324, Country Report No. 05/61, and Country Report No. 05/219).

Appendix II. Jamaica—Relations with the World Bank
(As of February 29, 2008)
The new Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Jamaica was discussed by the WB Board of
Executive Directors on May 10, 2005. The document proposes financial assistance of up to
US$150 million between 2006 and 2009, as well as technical and advisory services. The
CAS will support the Government’s own Medium Term Socioeconomic Policy Framework
for 2004-2009 with lending, analytical, and technical assistance to accelerate inclusive
economic growth, improve human development and opportunity, and help prevent and
reduce crime. It was prepared in collaboration with the government and was widely consulted
and discussed with other donors, representatives of the private sector, CBOs, Chambers of
Commerce, trade unions, and academic institutions. As part of the assistance program, the
Bank will undertake analytical work including a Poverty Assessment, a Financial Sector
Assessment Program (jointly with the International Monetary Fund), a Country Fiduciary
Assessment (jointly with the Inter-American Development Bank), and a Diagnostic of the
Investment Climate. The Bank Group assistance program will include support from the
International Finance Corporation (IFC), focused on investment in infrastructure, the
financial sector, services and other sectors, and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee
Facility (MIGA), focused on development of the financial sector and key infrastructure.
A. Projects
The Jamaica Reform of Secondary Education Project II was approved in March 2003 for
US$39.8 million. In support of Jamaica's fifteen-year program to reform secondary
education, the Project will improve the quality, and equity of secondary education, and
expand access to upper secondary education, as well as strengthen the capacity of the central
ministry, and regional offices to manage, and monitor the reform. The components of the
Second Reform of Secondary Education Project will: 1) finance grants to selected secondary
schools, on the basis of annual work programs, and budgets for activities designed to
improve student outcomes, as well as direct costs associated with preparing, and
implementing school improvement plans. Technical assistance will support the preparation of
a school improvement plan manual, and training materials, while training assistance in school
development, and management will be provided; 2) finance centrally coordinated activities
that complement the bottom up approach, and support all-age schools not eligible for school
improvement grants (SIGs), to rally national literacy programs, and mathematics, by
providing tools for teachers to diagnose the specific learning problems, enriching libraries
and media centers, and supporting counseling for at-risk youths; 3) provide access to upper
secondary school, by securing excess capacity in independent secondary schools, through
construction of new schools, and extension of existing selected schools; and, 4) support the
Ministry of Education, and regional offices in the implementation of the above components,
as their role shifts from centralized, to one responsive to school-based demands for technical
assistance, and continuous support on monitoring outcomes.

5

The Jamaica HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Project was approved in August 2002 for
US$15 million. The HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Project for Jamaica is part of the
Second Phase Multi-Country HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Adaptable Program Lending
(APL) for the Caribbean Region, which provides loans and/or credits to governments in the
Region to finance their HIV/AIDS programs. Jamaica has met the five eligibility criteria for
country participation. This project aims to support selected activities of Jamaica’s HIV/AIDS
National Strategic Plan (NSP). Using a multi-sectoral approach, it assists the Government of
Jamaica in curbing the spread of the HIV epidemic through 1) the expansion of preventive
programs targeted to high-risk groups as well as the general population; 2) the strengthening
of treatment, care, and support for persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA); and 3) the
strengthening of Jamaica's multisectoral capacity to respond to the epidemic
The Jamaica Social Safety Net Project was approved in February 2002 for US$40 million.
The Social Safety Net Project is supporting the Government's efforts to transform the social
safety net into a fiscally sound, and efficient system of social assistance for the poor, and
vulnerable groups. The components will: 1) finance conditional grants for poor children (up
to age 17), eligible under the program. Direct costs regarding schooling, and health care
delivery will be financed by those grants, conditioned on regular health clinic visits for
children up to the age of six not enrolled in school, and for children on school attendance up
to the age of seventeen; 2) finance conditional grants to poor pregnant/lactating mothers,
elderly poor over the age of sixty-five, and poor disabled, and destitute adults under the age
of sixty-five, eligible under the program. Benefits will be conditional on regular health clinic
visits for adult beneficiaries; and, 3) strengthen the institutional capacity of the Ministry of
Labor and Social Security, and institutions involved in the operation, and streamlining of the
social safety net in Jamaica. Support will be provided for enrollment mechanisms of
temporary employees, hired for data processing, including as well the financing of the
necessary technology information equipment, and software. Technical assistance, will
support implementation of the scoring formula, based on data from the Survey of Living
Conditions, namely at the early stages, when the scoring formula will require periodic
review, and refinement. Also included are training, and promotion assistance, project
management costs, and, monitoring, and evaluation systems.
The Jamaica National Community Development Project was approved in April 2003 for
US$15 million. The National Community Development Project aims at providing basic
services and creating temporary employment opportunities for the poorest groups in Jamaica.
To this end, several subprojects have been identified as priority by these communities for
funding by the Jamaica Social Investment Fund (JSIF). The project components include:
1) financing of demand-driven, and community-implemented socioeconomic infrastructure
works, and activities, through subprojects that include construction, and rehabilitation of
basic infrastructure, and social super-structure facilities. Community assessments will be
implemented, to ensure appropriate skills (or ability to acquire skills), and resources

6
availability to manage the proposed community-contracted works; 2) financing for technical
assistance, training, and strengthening programs to JSIF, and the various entities to be
involved in the project, particularly to support the Community Based Contracting (CBC)
system. Financing will also be provided for additional consultants to support implementation
of community contracting; and, 3) funding for goods required to facilitate subproject
supervision, monitoring, and community training.
The Jamaica Inner City Basic Services for the Poor Project was approved in March 2006
for US$29.3 million. The project development objective is to improve quality of life in 12
Jamaican inner-city areas and poor urban informal settlements through improved access to
basic urban infrastructure, financial services, land tenure regularization, enhanced
community capacity and improvements in public safety. Specifically, the project will:
(a) increase access and improve the quality of water, sanitation, solid waste collection
systems, electricity, roads, drainage and related community infrastructure for over 60,000
residents of poor urban informal settlements through capital investments and innovative
arrangements for operations and maintenance; (b) facilitate access to microfinance for
enterprise development and incremental home improvement for entrepreneurs and residents
in project areas; (c) increase security of tenure for eligible households in project areas; and
(d) enhance public safety through mediation services, community capacity building, skills
training and related social services.
B. Economic and Sector Work
During 2003 and 2004, the Bank prepared a Country Economic Memorandum focused on
issues related to accelerating inclusive economic growth and, during 2004 and 2005, a Public
Expenditure Review examining public expenditure allocation priorities and public sector
reform issues in Jamaica’s tight fiscal environment. In addition, a study on growth and
competitiveness issues in the Caribbean recently completed by the Bank provides the
Government with insights and policy recommendations for improving the competitiveness of
the economy. The dissemination of these reports represented a key instrument for policy
discussion with the Government on the country’s development priorities and the Bank’s
assistance strategy.
A Poverty Assessment currently under preparation will provide an updated assessment of
poverty levels and will focus on poverty and the labor market, and the link between crime
and violence and poverty. Work on a Country Fiduciary Assessment (CFA), in collaboration
with the Inter-American Development Bank, is underway to help strengthen public financial
management and procurement. It will also help to provide a sound basis for the
harmonization and alignment with the country’s procurement and financial management
systems. To help create a positive enabling environment for private sector driven growth, the
Bank is also undertaking a Diagnostic of Investment Climate which will provide policy
recommendations complementary to the recently completed study on growth and
competitiveness issues in the Caribbean.

7
The Bank will continue the informal monitoring of macroeconomic developments given the
vulnerability of the economy. This will be done within the context of the results based
monitoring framework agreed between the Government and the donors. In addition, the Bank
will undertake just-in-time policy notes to follow-up on specific findings and
recommendations of the studies undertaken during the CAS period and other issues jointly
identified with the authorities.
In addition to the country specific analytical work, Jamaica will benefit from ongoing and
planned regional studies. A Caribbean regional study on Crime, Violence and Social
Exclusion would focus on the impact of crime on tourism, investment, poverty, and social
cohesion. This would be a multi-sectoral endeavor aimed at developing recommendations
that would draw on experience from successful interventions in Brazil and elsewhere. The
Bank has completed a Social Protection Strategy Review paper for the Caribbean, including a
focus on Jamaica. The objective of the strategy is to strengthen the Bank’s ability to support
clients on social protection through: (i) better understanding the key socio-economic risks,
existing country-level social protection programs, coverage and implementation gaps, and
outstanding country-level needs; (ii) stronger coordination with country counterparts and
donors; and (iii) more strategic emphasis on the Bank's comparative advantage in the region.
A Caribbean regional study on Migration, Remittances and the Diaspora will examine the
impact of migration and its implications for public policy decisions surrounding the financing
of higher education and skills development; the impact, facilitation, and potential leverage of
remittance flows; and the potential for the growth of niche markets among the diaspora. This
work will be undertaken in close collaboration with other donors, most notably the IDB.
Additional planned regional studies cover issues related to pension reform, health financing,
and the infrastructure and financial sectors

Appendix III. Jamaica—Relations with the Inter-American Development Bank
Jamaica joined the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) in 1969. Since then, the
IDB has approved 96 loans (81 projects) to Jamaica amounting to US$1.8 billion and
195 technical cooperation operations totaling US$63.3 million. IDB financial assistance has
supported a wide range of infrastructural, environmental and social sector projects with a
view to enhancing Jamaica’s human resource and absorptive capacity and strengthening the
foundation for private sector-led growth. In addition, the IDB has supported reforms aimed at
strengthening the institutional and regulatory environment.
The IDB is the leading lender to Jamaica among multilateral development partners. As of
February 2008, Jamaica’s outstanding debt to the IDB stood at US$ 583.2 million, of which
US$581.8 million were public sector loans and US$1.4 million were loans to the private
sector. The total represents twelve percent of public external debt and thirty-five percent of
multilateral debt. Clearly, the IDB’s share of total public external debt—like that of most
other multilateral and bilateral agencies—has declined since 2003.

As of February 2008, the Bank’s portfolio consisted of 10 investment loans1 valued at
US$217 million, and 31 non-reimbursable technical cooperations valued at US$10.3 million.
Fifty-six percent of the IDB project funds and fifty percent of the TC funds have been
disbursed, leaving US$ 86.7 million available for disbursement.

Over time, growing government current expenditures have crowded out capital expenditures
that caused budgetary allocations to IDB-supported projects to fall far short of that needed
for a normal pace of implementation, particularly in the period from 2002/03 to 2004/05. Due
to delayed project execution, many assumptions made in the original design of operations
became outdated and, coupled with weak advocacy as well as poor implementation capacity,
project execution delayed even more and the achievement of development objectives came
under threat.

In recognition of this, the government and IDB have collaborated to rationalize the portfolio
through partial cancellation of loans without affecting the initial development objectives.
From the end of 2004 to end of 2006, the government and IDB agreed to cancel a total
US$59.8 million in loan resources, spread over several operations. In addition to this, the
Bank initiated a focused and sustained campaign to divert fiscal resources to the portfolio
coupled with the reformulation of a number of operations by removing outdated design
elements. These efforts, as well as intensified support to executing agencies, evidently
resulted in an improved pace of project implementation in 2007 (Table 3).
In August 2006, the IDB approved a new country strategy for the 2006-2009 period. In view
of the aforementioned fiscal space issue, the new strategy de-emphasizes public sector
investment lending and instead focuses on policy-based lending, grant modalities, and

11
lending to the private sector. The principal areas of focus are: (i) private sector development;
(ii) value for money; and (iii) reducing vulnerability to natural disasters.
Growing repayments from lending in the late 1990s and the constraints on disbursements on
investment projects have resulted in negative net loan flows since 2005 (Table 4).

Appendix IV. Jamaica—Statistical Issues
Effective surveillance is hampered by data gaps for the financial sector outside of
commercial banks, and for public entities outside of the central government. In early 2003,
Jamaica started participating in the Fund’s General Data Dissemination System (GDDS),
which provides participants with a framework for the development of the statistical system.
Jamaica should now focus its efforts on improving its data and dissemination practices by
moving towards the goal of subscribing to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS)
over the medium term. No data on industrial production, wholesale or producer prices,
import volumes, or export and import prices have been reported for publication in the
International Financial Statistics (IFS) in recent years.
Key websites for statistics on Jamaica:
Bank of Jamaica:
Ministry of Finance and Planning:
Planning Institute of Jamaica:
Statistical Institute of Jamaica:

http://www.boj.org.jm/
http://www.mof.gov.jm/
http://www.pioj.gov.jm/
http://www.statinja.com/

There are significant weaknesses in the national accounts and other real sector data. In regard
to GDP estimates, concerns relate both to level and growth rate. Addressing these
shortcomings has been hindered, inter alia, by insufficient legal authority granted to the
Statistical Institute of Jamaica (STATIN) to collect source data, as well as by institutional
weaknesses, and a lack of resources. However, efforts are being made to improve the
national accounts, including through updating the base year (currently dating back to 1996)
and implementing the 1993 System of National Accounts (SNA93). Assistance on national
accounts methodology has been provided by Statistics Canada and STA. The first publication
of quarterly national accounts took place in August 2002.
Prices
Jamaica (with assistance from the IMF Caribbean Regional Technical Assistance Center,
CARTAC) revised its consumer price index (CPI) series in 2007. The CPI revision updated
expenditure weights of the CPI that had dated from 1984. The new CPI weights are based on
a household survey conducted in 2004-05.

13
Government finance statistics
Central government operations and debt data are updated on a monthly basis. Some
expenditures, however, are not recorded during the period they actually occur, making it
difficult to asses the fiscal policy stance. Also, data on public entities outside the central
government, although regularly published, are not reported consistently across entities and in
a way that is amenable to assessing and formulating the overall direction of fiscal policy.
There is a paucity of data on the external debt stocks and maturities falling due for the
nonfinancial public sector.
Government finance statistics are available at:
Debt: http://www.mof.gov.jm/dmu/
Budget: http://www.mof.gov.jm/programmes/em/fpmu/default.shtml
However, fiscal data are not currently reported for publication in the IFS. In 2007, the
authorities reported data for 2006, in GFSM 2001 format, for publication in the 2007 GFS
Yearbook.
Monetary and financial statistics
Monetary statistics published by the Bank of Jamaica (BOJ) are sectorized, classified, and
valued in accordance with international standards, and are provided to the Fund in a timely
manner. Currently, information on deposit money banks and monetary authorities is being
reported on a regular basis. The BOJ initiated the submission of monetary and financial
statistics based on standardized report forms in March 2007. Financial sector statistics
outside of the banking system are weak. The absence of adequate data on security dealers is
particularly problematic, as dealers’ liabilities to the public are larger than those of banks.
Consequently, related systemic implications are difficult to assess without timely and
comprehensive statistics.
Balance of payments
The BOJ compiles and disseminates balance of payments statistics on a monthly and annual
basis. Detailed annual balance of payments and international investment position (IIP) data
are reported by the BOJ for publication in the Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook
(BOPSY) and the IFS. In September 2007, Jamaica reported for the first time IIP data to
STA; annual IIP data since 2005 are now available in BOPSY and IFS.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
JAMAICA
Staff Report for the 2008 Article IV Consultation
Supplementary Information
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2008 Consultation with Jamaica
Approved by Ranjit Teja and Matthew Fisher
April 16, 2008
1.
This supplement provides an update on recent developments, including the
authorities’ budget proposal to parliament for FY 2008/09.
2.
Inflationary pressures remain unabated although the Jamaican dollar has
appreciated moderately and international reserves have continued to recover. Annual
headline inflation rose to 19.9 percent in March, from 18.2 percent in January, mostly on
account of food, fuel, and transportation. About two-thirds of the reserve losses that occurred
during June–November 2007 have now been recovered and international reserves stood at
$2.1 billion at end-March.
3.
A large unregulated investment scheme has been declared unable to make
payments by a court-appointed receiver. Preliminary indications are that liabilities far
exceed assets. The principal behind the scheme has been arrested while investigations
continue, including into the nature of the entity’s affiliates in several countries.
4.
The budget deficit for FY 2007/08, which ended March 31, is likely to have been
lower than recently anticipated, due to underexecution of investment spending. The
latest estimates show some capital projects behind schedule. The primary surplus is,
therefore, likely to have amounted to 9 percent of GDP, compared to the 8¼ percent of GDP
indicated in the staff report (4/3/08), but still below the 10¼ percent of GDP target in the
original budget (Tables 1 and 2).
5.
The draft budget for FY 2008/09 envisages non-interest spending to be
1.8 percent of GDP higher than anticipated in the staff report (4/3/08). Parliamentary
debate on the FY 2008/09 budget commenced on April 10. The draft budget envisages
capital spending to be 0.8 percent of GDP higher than anticipated in the staff report (4/3/08),
making up for the shortfall in FY 2007/08. The remainder of the spending increase in
FY 2008/09, relative to the projections in the staff report (4/3/08), is accounted for by wages.
Negotiations with public sector unions on a new agreement covering FY 2008/09–2009/10

2

have not yet concluded. However, the government’s current proposal to unions, included in
the draft budget, implies a wage bill that is almost 1 percent of GDP higher than anticipated.
6.
Increased revenues will help partially offset the higher spending. The authorities’
currently project FY 2008/09 revenues and grants 1.1 percent of GDP higher than envisaged
in the staff report (4/3/08) and also anticipate some privatization receipts. The draft budget
proposes tax policy measures affecting cigarettes and motor vehicles to raise 0.2 percent of
GDP. The higher wage bill will also lead to increased collection of payroll taxes (0.2 percent
of GDP). The remainder of the revenue increase is expected to accrue from administrative
measures.
7.
Raising sufficient revenues from administrative measures will not be easy. The
authorities have had recent success with administrative measures—revenues increased by
over 1 percent of GDP in FY 2007/08 from strengthening tax administration and arrears
collection. The authorities hope to expand on this success this year. Inter alia, they have
announced an amnesty program under which interest and penalties will be waived if the
principal arrears are paid in full by June 30, 2008. Tax arrears, excluding interest and
penalties, are currently estimated at over 6 percent of GDP. Nevertheless, it will be
challenging to repeat the tax administration performance of FY 2006/07 and increase
revenues by a further 0.6–0.7 percent of GDP, which the authorities will need to do to
achieve their revenue objectives. Also, the amnesty program risks undermining incentives to
remain current on tax payments in future.
8.
The new information reinforces the thrust of the staff appraisal in the staff
report (4/3/08). The overperformance, relative to earlier expectations, on the primary surplus
in FY 2007/08 has been offset by the lower target in FY 2008/09. However, increased
spending in FY 2008/09 will make it more difficult to balance the budget by FY 2010/11, as
the authorities envisage (see paragraphs 14–17 in the staff report of 4/3/08). The widened
current account deficit, more-than-expected inflation, and vulnerabilities represented by the
weak external environment continue to argue for a strong fiscal adjustment this budget year
to support the monetary and exchange rate policies.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2008 Article IV Consultation with
Jamaica
On April 21, 2008, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Jamaica.1
Background
Jamaica’s economy has weathered a series of adverse shocks over the past year. Hurricane
Dean and heavy rains caused extensive damage to agriculture and disrupted mining activity.
Also, there was a reversal of the one-off increase in tourists diverted from hurricane-affected
Mexican destinations in 2006. As a result of these developments, real economic growth is
estimated to have declined to 1 percent in FY 2007/08 (April-March) from 2½ percent the
previous year. Moreover, the supply side impact of the weather-related shocks exacerbated
already significant price pressures associated with rising global food and oil prices. Headline
inflation more than doubled over the past year to 19.9 percent by March 2008.
The fiscal primary balance improved in FY 2007/08 but by less than anticipated in the original
budget and due in part to delays in implementing investment spending. Improved tax
administration enabled the government to increase revenues by over 1 percent of GDP over
the previous year. However, non-wage current expenditures and capital spending were
increased sharply in a mid-year budget supplement, although capital spending fell behind
schedule. All in all, the primary surplus for FY 2007/08 is estimated at 9 percent of GDP,
compared to 8 percent of GDP the previous year but short of the 10¼ percent of GDP target in
the original budget.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
Bank prudential indicators have remained generally sound notwithstanding a sustained rapid
growth in credit. The growth of unregulated investment schemes promising implausibly high
rates of return has, however, been a worrisome financial development with potentially adverse
macroeconomic consequences.
On the external front, rising global energy prices contributed to a widening of the current
account deficit to 15½ percent of GDP. Moreover, the confluence of economic developments
in Jamaica and ongoing turbulence in global credit markets unsettled the foreign exchange
market in 2007, put pressures on the capital account and led to reserve losses. All in all,
reserves declined by 20 percent during July–November 2007. Reserves have, however,
recovered significantly in recent months following hikes in domestic interest rates by the Bank
of Jamaica.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that Jamaica’s economic challenges have been compounded by a
more difficult environment, with natural disasters, the global economic slowdown, and
increases in global oil and food prices contributing to slower economic growth, rising inflation
and a widening current account deficit. Strains in international financial markets have put
further pressure on an economy reliant on external financing. Directors agreed that the key
imperatives are to address the economy’s vulnerabilities, improve Jamaica’s lack-luster growth
performance, and strengthen its medium-term public debt dynamics.
Against this background, Directors welcomed the authorities’ efforts at setting out an ambitious
medium-term macroeconomic strategy that places high priority on the maintenance of
macroeconomic stability, fiscal consolidation, and structural reforms. They encouraged the
authorities to work expeditiously toward the implementation of their strategy and to build a
broad domestic consensus in support of their reform initiatives.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ medium-term program of fiscal adjustment aimed at
balancing the budget by FY 2010/11 and at establishing a virtuous cycle of lower debt and
higher growth. They noted that the adjustment effort would need to be underpinned by broadranging reforms of the tax system, public services and public enterprises, and they
underscored the Fund’s readiness to provide technical assistance in its areas of competence.
In particular, Directors saw merit in the early preparation of a fiscal Report on the Observance
of Standards and Codes (ROSC) to help strengthen fiscal management and improve
transparency.
In discussing the desirable pace of fiscal adjustment, Directors recognized the need to set
realistic targets and to provide adequate fiscal space for growth-enhancing investment
spending. At the same time, most Directors considered that a stronger fiscal adjustment in the
current budget year would make a good start to the substantial effort needed over the coming
three years to implement the authorities’ program. Against this background, they encouraged
the authorities to examine carefully the scope to reduce non-productive expenditures, noting
that this would help reverse the weakening primary surplus projected for FY 2008–09. Early

3
fiscal adjustment would also support monetary and exchange rate policies, against the
backdrop of the widened current account deficit, higher-than-expected inflation, and the weak
external environment.
Directors commended the authorities’ commitment to monetary and exchange rate flexibility.
They were reassured that the authorities stand ready to take necessary actions as conditions
warrant. Directors were of the view that a further moderate rise in interest rates might be
needed to alleviate inflationary pressures and stem capital outflows. They considered that the
current level of the exchange rate broadly reflects fundamentals, and advised the authorities to
stand ready to let the Jamaican dollar adjust should large balance of payments pressures
persist.
Directors welcomed the positive indicators of banking sector soundness. They stressed that
continued vigilance over the financial sector is warranted, in particular with respect to the risks
posed by the unregulated investment schemes promising implausibly high rates of return.
Directors were encouraged by the authorities’ intention to prevent unregulated investment
schemes that are not in the public interest, while ensuring that legitimate investments can
proceed. They supported the authorities’ request for technical assistance in this regard. Given
the cross-border risks posed by such schemes, Directors also encouraged enhanced regional
cooperation among supervisors. They called on the authorities to broaden the collection of
information on the formal financial system to allow for a more comprehensive assessment of
systemic risks, including from changes in the global and domestic economic environments.
Directors considered the broad nature of the authorities’ structural agenda as appropriate, and
they encouraged an expeditious detailing and sustained implementation of the reforms.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to continue to implement measures to improve
the business environment and to divest non-core public companies, which will be essential to
promote critically-needed private sector led growth and strengthen competitiveness.

Statement by Jonathan Fried, Executive Director for Jamaica
and Murna Morgan, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
April 21, 2008
Our Jamaican authorities wish to express their appreciation to the staff for the cordiality and
frankness that characterized the Article IV consultation. The assessment and
recommendations reflect the constructive contribution the Article IV process makes to
domestic policy discourse on a range of economic policy initiatives.
Despite the first change in government in 18 years, Jamaica enjoys continuity and broad
consensus on the major economic policy fundamentals. The new government, which took
office in September 2007, has set out a new medium-term macroeconomic strategy for
Jamaica. They place very high priority on the maintenance of macroeconomic stability and
fiscal consolidation. They are committed to setting realistic and achievable macroeconomic
targets as the essential foundation for building credibility, engendering confidence, and
ultimately delivering a sustainable higher growth rate.
Accordingly, the authorities’ medium-term policies seek to strengthen the economic
foundation for a vibrant and competitive economy through strong fiscal discipline and debt
reduction, reform of the tax system to increase efficiency and effectiveness, enhancing the
business climate, and further improving the quality of governance through improving public
sector management and reducing bureaucracy. The authorities have taken a consultative
approach to policy making, pursuing broad partnership with key stakeholders from the
private sector, civil society and the diaspora, while recognizing that difficult choices will
have to be made. They are also pursuing more active engagement with the multilateral
institutions.
Recent Economic Developments
Jamaica was confronted with a number of challenges in FY2007/08, which were in large
measure triggered by exogenous shocks related to the deteriorating global economy and to
weather-related events. Economic activity was severely impacted by the dislocation resulting
from Hurricane Dean and sporadic floods, including supply shocks to agricultural prices.
High oil and commodity prices also had a significant impact. These factors, along with the
exchange rate pass-through from the 4.6 percent depreciation of the Jamaica dollar vis-à-vis
the US dollar, undermined the pursuit of price stability and contributed to a significant
increase in inflation from 7.4 percent in FY2006/07 to 19.9 percent in FY2007/08. GDP
growth is estimated at 0.9 percent, compared with 2.5 percent in FY2006/07. Nonetheless,
the fiscal deficit at 3.7 percent of GDP for FY2007/08 was lower than anticipated, reflecting
strong corrective measures taken by the authorities to contain expenditure and an aggressive
revenue compliance program.

2
The Macroeconomic Program
The authorities’ 2008/09 macroeconomic program is aimed at creating conditions to support
sustainable growth over the medium term. The main features are improvement in fiscal and
debt performance, prudent monetary policy to rein-in inflation risks, maintenance of
adequate reserves to support investor confidence, restoration of growth in the agricultural
sector and expansion of capacity in the manufacturing and export sectors. The outlook is for
increased economic activity, driven by capacity expansion and recovery in sectors adversely
affected by weather-related and other exogenous shocks.
The 2008/09 budget presented on April 10, 2008, reflects the new administration’s
determination to provide a framework that will encourage new investments and jobs, and
hence accelerate growth. The budget provides for increased allocations for infrastructure
development, restoration and expansion of the agriculture sector, and for the social sector health and education. In the light of rapid increases in food prices globally, the social safety
net has been widened to further protect the poor and vulnerable.
Fiscal Policy and Debt
Our authorities are keenly aware of the imperative of improving Jamaica’s debt dynamics to
bring about sustained macroeconomic stability and growth, recognizing that the path is not
without risks and uncertainties. Over the years, Jamaica’s challenges have necessitated
delicate and often difficult trade-offs between deficit/debt reduction and stimulating growth.
The staff’s recommendations for addressing the policy challenges presented by the fiscal
deficit and high public debt are consistent with the authorities’ medium-term program. The
differences of view between the positions of the staff and the authorities lie not over the
overall objectives, but rather regarding the pace of implementation.
The staff’s recommendation is for a front-loaded adjustment, with a higher primary surplus
of 10¼ percent in FY2008/09, compared with the authorities’ 8.4 percent. Years of
generating double-digit primary surpluses in Jamaica, while demonstrative of the country’s
commitment to fiscal discipline, have seriously constrained public investment. By the staff’s
own analysis, “...countries with very low public investment, like Jamaica, appear to grow
more slowly, even if private investment remains high”. In the view of the authorities, a
framework that will encourage new investments, job creation and hence, accelerate growth
requires a sound program of fiscal consolidation over the medium term that encompasses a
gradual, moderate reduction of the fiscal deficit over a three-year period to a balanced budget
in 2010/11. Such an approach will achieve a sustainable reduction in the debt over the
medium term while allowing for sufficient fiscal space to pursue measures to stimulate
economic growth and consequently increase revenue. Our authorities are convinced that the
front-loaded approach recommended by the staff would increase the risk of choking off
investment and growth opportunities. The authorities and the staff agree fully that prudent
fiscal management, greater expenditure prioritization and more efficient delivery of public
services remain critical elements of the strategy.

3

Discussions between the government, trade unions and public sector workers towards a third
Memorandum of Understanding (MOU III) for a two-year (2008-2010) wage agreement has
not been without its challenges, given the sharp rise in inflation and its impact on the cost of
living. However, negotiations have reached an advanced stage and ratification of MOU III is
expected shortly. In keeping with their commitment to prudent fiscal management, the
authorities are cognizant of the need to balance adequate wage packages for public sector
workers concomitant with higher levels of productivity, with the need for wage increases to
remain within the bounds of a credible macroeconomic framework that will facilitate growth
and improved living standards.
Tax Reform
A comprehensive tax reform program to simplify the tax system, further increase compliance
and broaden the tax base will be an essential element of the authorities’ fiscal policy. The
last overhaul of Jamaica’s tax system was undertaken in 1986. An extensive review of
proposed tax reform measures is underway, taking into account previous tax reform studies.
Tax policy-related technical assistance is being funded by the IDB, and the authorities have
approached the Fund’s Fiscal Affairs Department for additional assistance in this field.
A number of measures will be implemented to improve tax administration during the current
fiscal year. These include establishing new revenue centers and continued upgrading of
existing ones to improve accessibility and make them more user-friendly; expanding the
menu of options for e-payments; implementing an e-filing facility, and at the Customs
Department, an electronic export system to expedite, simplify and standardize the processing
of exports. Third-party collection agreements will also be introduced to allow for collection
of specific tax types through various agencies such as banks and bill collection agencies.
Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
Monetary policy management was significantly challenged in FY2007/08 by rising inflation
and instability in the foreign exchange market. Intense foreign exchange demand pressures
were experienced during the year, fuelled by the unexpected rate of depreciation, portfolio
switching in the context of narrowing of interest rate spreads - facilitated by high levels of
liquidity and increased payments for higher levels of imports, particularly oil. Investor
confidence was also negatively impacted by pre-election uncertainties. These developments
necessitated policy actions by the Bank of Jamaica (BOJ) to absorb excess liquidity and
restore stability to the foreign exchange market through increases in interest rates, augmented
by increased offerings of open market instruments and the sale of foreign exchange.
Notwithstanding the ease in pressure in recent months, the BOJ continues to monitor market
conditions and is prepared to take actions as may be necessary to ensure stability in the
financial and foreign exchange markets.

4
Financial Sector
Our authorities are fully cognizant of the need to further strengthen the resilience of the
financial sector. They share the staff’s assessment of the main risks to the sector in the
current environment and the need to take actions to reduce the risks posed by unregulated
financial schemes. Stress testing by the BOJ on the resilience of the banking sector in the
event of the collapse of these schemes found that there is an adequate level of capital to
absorb potential losses. This limited exposure is consistent with the upgrade in prudential
standards and the tightening in loan administration that forms part of the ongoing
strengthening of financial sector supervision.
Unregulated investment schemes, by their very nature, elude regulatory oversight, thereby
posing serious challenges for the regulatory authorities in terms of how to prevent the spread
and/or closure of their operations. The authorities have been pro-active within the mandate
of the respective institutions, pursuing these schemes through the legal system and
disseminating public advisories on an ongoing basis. The Financial Services Commission
(FSC), which regulates the securities, insurance and private pension industries, continues to
take actions authorized by governing law to prevent these “clubs” from offering securities in
contravention of the Securities Act. Cease and desist orders have been issued and the FSC is
supported by the Financial Investigation Division of the Ministry of Finance and the Public
Service in cases where prosecution becomes necessary. The authorities are, on an expedited
basis, assessing the need for amended or new legislation, as may be required, to address
oversight of such investment schemes. In addition, the authorities have requested technical
assistance from the Fund to improve the assessment of systemic stability and the systematic
stress-testing of licensed securities dealers, and to develop an appropriate data framework to
enhance the current practices of the FSC, including by improving the financial and prudential
dataflow from licensed non-bank financial institutions.
More generally, to enhance information-sharing across the regulatory agencies and improve
capability to assess financial stability and contagion risks, the Financial Regulatory Council,
comprising the regulators, the deposit insurance corporation and the Ministry of Finance, is
being re-energized.
Enhancing the Business Climate
The new government places great emphasis on private sector development and increased
competitiveness to spur growth. They are fully aware that while investment must be private
sector-driven, an enabling environment is necessary. Accordingly, steps are being taken to
simplify administrative procedures and eliminate unnecessary restrictions and requirements.
A policy-based loan was recently signed with the IDB as part of a program to enhance
competitiveness in Jamaica. In addition, the EU has committed to provide funding under its
budget support program to reduce bureaucratic red tape and enhance the business climate.
Efforts to rebuild the foundation for growth and competitiveness also include a focus on

5
small and medium size enterprises (SMEs). A special financing facility is to be launched
through the Jamaica EX-IM Bank for start up and further expansion of those SMEs with
capacity for speedy implementation and job creation.
In keeping with the authorities’commitment to fiscal containment and more efficient delivery
of public services, they are pursuing a policy of divestment of non-core assets. In February
2008, the government sold 49 percent of its share in the petroleum refining company,
PETROJAM. Negotiations are advanced with the preferred bidder for divestment of the
assets of the Sugar Company of Jamaica, a process which is expected to be completed by
end-2008. The process towards divesting Air Jamaica Limited has begun with the
appointment of the IFC as lead financial advisor and coordinator for the work of specialist
consultants. A Rationalization Plan is being developed for public entities, encompassing
winding-up and removing inactive entities from the Companies Register, merging compatible
entities, and divesting entities where appropriate.
Conclusions
The Jamaican authorities are undertaking an ambitious medium-term macroeconomic
strategy against the backdrop of the difficult global economic environment, and the economic
slowdown in Jamaica’s major trading partner, the USA. They are cognizant of serious
downside risks, despite the apparent weak correlation between Jamaica’s economic
performance and US economic slowdowns. But a clear commitment to growth-enhancing
reforms, accompanied by continuing prudent fiscal and monetary policies, provides the
foundation for tackling fundamental issues. The authorities will partner not only with
domestic stakeholders, but also with the international financial community to address
Jamaica’s vulnerabilities. The authorities look forward to continued excellent dialogue with
the Fund, as they seek to transform the Jamaican economy.
