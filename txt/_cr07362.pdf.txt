TURKEY
Staff Report for the 2007 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2007 Consultation with Turkey
Approved by Susan Schadler and Matthew Fisher
May 4, 2007
Executive Summary
Achievements and challenges: Considerable progress has been made in shaking off the legacy of the
2001 crisis, with the large output gap closed, public debt ratios sharply down, economic institutions
strengthened, and the financial system normalized. This revival stems from disciplined financial
policies, advances in structural reform, political stability, and favorable global economic conditions.
Inflation, however, is still high and new vulnerabilities associated with strong economic performance
(large current account deficit and rapid credit growth) have emerged, exposing Turkey to shifts in
investor sentiment. Political uncertainty from upcoming elections amplifies near-term risks. Turkey
also faces structural challenges (including low employment, widespread informality, and low financial
intermediation) that need to be tackled to raise growth durably and catch up to EU income levels.
Outlook and risks: Economic activity is moderating but becoming less reliant on domestic demand.
Growth is projected at 5 percent this year but should pick up next year as real interest rates decline
and election uncertainties dissipate. The current account deficit should narrow, owing to softer
domestic demand and robust external growth, but will likely stay high in the near term. Risks to this
outlook are balanced. Long-term growth is expected to range between 5−7 percent, depending on the
quality of macroeconomic policies and the pace and breadth of structural reforms.
Discussions: The authorities and staff agreed that the strategy for recovering from the 2001 crisis had
been appropriate and successful. Looking ahead, entrenching stability and rejuvenating structural
reform would be key pillars of economic policy. On the former, discussions focused on when the
primary fiscal surplus target could be eased, how the inflation target could be achieved, and how to
protect the economy from vulnerabilities stemming from large capital inflows. Discussions also
explored goals of a pro-growth reform agenda. There was broad consensus on the requirements. Staff,
however, cautioned against labor market reform proposals that impose upfront fiscal costs without
substantially reducing labor market rigidities. The authorities viewed favorably staff’s proposal to
adopt a fiscal rule to anchor medium-term fiscal objectives, but were not yet ready to commit to it.
Policy priorities: To preserve market confidence and facilitate disinflation, spending should be
contained to achieve the primary surplus target of at least 6½ percent of GNP. Monetary policy
should remain tight until inflation is firmly on a declining path. To enhance the resilience of the
economy to shocks, buffers in public and private balance sheets should be increased and financing
structures improved. In the medium run, fiscal policy needs to balance continued debt reduction with
the need to make room for growth-enhancing tax cuts on labor and financial transactions. This puts a
premium on measures to contain spending, such as social security and civil service reform. Reducing
rigidities in labor and product markets, furthering privatization in electricity and banking, and
strengthening financial market institutions and supervision are other key reform goals.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Having secured a strong recovery from the 2001 crisis, Turkey now faces a new
set of challenges. In recent years, growth has been brisk, inflation has been reduced, and
balance sheets have strengthened. Markets have rewarded this stabilization with lower—
though still substantial—risk premiums and large capital inflows. Recently, however, the pace
of economic activity has moderated, while disinflation has halted. Moreover, a wide current
account deficit, largely reflecting surging inflows, exposes the economy to sudden shifts in
investor sentiment. Risks are amplified by the upcoming elections and geopolitical factors.
2.
The Article IV consultation provides an opportunity to take a fresh look at the
economy from a medium-term perspective.1 Discussions covered measures to preserve
investor confidence in the run-up to the elections and ensure a credible policy framework in
the period following expiration of the current Fund arrangement. With the upcoming postelection period opening a window of opportunity for a new reform agenda, discussions
focused on how to prioritize structural reforms to raise potential growth and increase
resilience to external shocks.
II. ACHIEVEMENTS AND CHALLENGES
3.
Turkey has experienced an economic revival in recent years thanks to sound
macroeconomic policies, a conducive global environment, and political stability.
However, the task of shifting the economy to safe ground is incomplete, and Turkey’s
success is now bringing new vulnerabilities. Moreover, growth is being held back by
continuing structural impediments.
A. Economic Revival
4.
Turkey’s vigorous economic recovery from the 2001 crisis has surpassed
expectations (Figures 1−3). The economy has grown briskly, driven by private consumption

and investment and fueled by declining real interest rates, surging capital inflows, rapid credit
growth, and rising productivity. Inflation, meanwhile, dropped to its lowest level in 34 years,
helping to reverse dollarization. At the same time, financial markets posted significant gains.
5.
In a mutually reinforcing process, strong economic performance has been
accompanied by improved balance sheets. The public debt ratio has come down sharply,
and its composition has improved. Central bank reserves have risen. Bank balance sheets have
strengthened (low NPLs and capital levels above regulatory minima). And while corporates
and households have increased their leverage, this process started from very low levels.

The real economy has modernized, becoming less reliant on traditional sectors
and more open to trade. Moreover, foreign ownership has increased significantly,

Sound economic policies, political stability, and generally favorable external
conditions have underpinned these positive outcomes.
•

Policies. On the macroeconomic side, fiscal discipline (centered on the 6.5 percent of
GNP primary surplus target) and monetary policy restraint by an independent central
bank have set off a virtuous cycle of disinflation, declining interest rates, and high,
private sector-led growth. The floating lira has served as a shock absorber and
improved incentives for managing currency risks. On the structural side, bank
recapitalization and enhanced supervision, tax reforms, and privatization have restarted
private credit, promoted FDI, and spurred competitiveness. The ongoing SBA has
helped anchor these policies, despite encountering delays in structural reforms (Box 1).

•

Politics. After a decade of coalition governments, Turkey has been ruled since
November 2002 by a single party with a dominant parliamentary majority. This has
facilitated policymaking, as the government has embraced financial discipline and
market-friendly policies anchored to Fund arrangements and EU accession.

External environment. Low global interest rates, combined with Turkey’s relatively
high returns and improved investment climate, have produced a surge in capital
inflows, with a significant portion financing private sector activity. FDI has taken off,
covering more than half the current account deficit. Meanwhile, sustained growth
among Turkey’s main trading partners has helped exports.
B. Economic and Financial Challenges

8.
Turkey faces several vulnerabilities that need to be carefully managed to avoid
the boom-bust cycles of the past. Some vulnerabilities (relating to debt levels, inflation, and
dollarization) reflect the remnants of the large imbalances inherited from the 2001 crisis.
Others (large current account deficit, appreciating currency, rapid credit growth) have
emerged as byproducts of strong growth and prospects for EU accession. These are unlikely
to abate in the near-term.

10

9.
Large capital inflows have brought
benefits, but also vulnerability to reversals in
investor sentiment. Surging capital inflows
have appreciated the lira (up over 30 percent
since end-2002 in real terms) and, with higher
oil prices, have widened the current account
deficit. As a result, the downward trend in
external debt has reversed and gross financing
requirements have risen (Appendix I). And,
while the composition of external financing
flows has improved sharply, short-term debt
rollover requirements remain high, and the stock
of nonresidents’ portfolio investment has
reached record levels reflecting strong
international investor appetite for lira assets and
carry trades. These developments, combined with
still-low reserve coverage, expose Turkey more
than most other emerging market countries to
changes in investor sentiment, as seen during last
year’s financial market turmoil (Table 1;
Figures 4–5). Moreover, shocks to emerging
markets have non-negligible spillovers onto lira
assets and vice versa (Box 2).

Evidence on lira misalignment is mixed: some conventional measures suggest
overvaluation, but export performance has so far been good. However, such measures
may be unreliable for economies undergoing structural changes like Turkey. More
heuristically, relative unit labor costs and real wages remain near historical averages, while
exports continue to gain market shares, albeit at a moderating pace (Figure 6). So far, the
effects of the lira appreciation have largely been offset by slack in the labor market, which
has kept real wage growth below surging labor productivity. Still, competitiveness has
weakened in some industries—such as the large textile sector, which also suffers from the
elimination of quotas. This may reflect, however, a normal structural transformation as
Turkey moves up the technology ladder.

Private balance sheets, while
strengthening, remain sensitive to shocks. Bank
balance sheets have generally become more
resilient, as banks have addressed most of the
weaknesses at the root of the 2001 crisis.
However, rapid credit growth (especially in
consumer and housing loans), widening maturity
mismatches (deposit funding is mostly short-term
and adjustable rate lending to households was
until recently prohibited), and still sizable, albeit
declining, sovereign and currency risks pose
challenges to banks.2 The generally encouraging
stress test results (reported in the Financial Sector
Stability Assessment, FSSA) and the limited impact
of last year’s turbulence on bank balance sheets
provide assurance—even if the quick rebound in
asset prices does not make last year’s turbulence a
conclusive test (Figure 7).3 Among corporates, an
assessment of currency risks is impaired by scarcity
of data on hedging, though there are indications that
the open foreign currency position may have
widened sharply. Household indebtedness has also
increased briskly, albeit from a very low base,
outpacing asset or disposable income growth.

Cross-country evidence indicates that a sustained credit boom could raise the probability of banking distress,
especially if combined with large macroeconomic shocks.

Stress tests show that, although there are some vulnerabilities to large interest and credit quality shocks, the
sector as a whole has substantial capital buffers.

Public debt ratios are still relatively high, constraining implementation of
countercyclical policy and bidding up interest rates. Stress tests show that debt could
become unsustainable if fiscal discipline were to be abandoned (Appendix II). Exposure to
interest rate and currency volatility is also non-negligible, as maturities are still short and
around one-fifth of net debt is linked to foreign currency.

Inroads have been made on the structural front, but the reform agenda is far

structural reforms. However, financial intermediation remains low, constraining investment
opportunities, while a declining domestic saving rate heightens the dependence on foreign

inflows. In addition, long-term fiscal spending
pressures (especially on pensions and health) and
weak tax enforcement constrain the room for easing
the heavy tax burden. Potential bottlenecks in
electricity supply also suggest scope for greater
private sector involvement in the energy sector.
Finally, a large informal sector, where productivity
lags, and low employment, especially among
women, point to excessive regulatory and tax
burdens on labor (Box 3). Tackling these structural
challenges could raise economic growth to the rates
seen in Turkey’s most successful emerging market
peers and accelerate convergence to EU incomes.

III. ECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND RISKS
15.
The impetus to growth from the post-crisis stabilization shows signs of ebbing. In
2006, growth moderated to 6 percent from 7½ in 2005, reflecting higher interest rates and
weaker consumer confidence following last year’s financial market turbulence (Table 2). The
composition of growth, however, became more balanced with increased reliance on net
exports. With monetary policy expected to remain tight and election uncertainties weighing
on confidence, growth could further slow to 5 percent this year, widening the output gap
modestly. As election-related uncertainties dissipate and real interest rates decline, current
policies are projected to result in a cyclical upswing in growth to 6 percent in 2008.

The current account deficit may have peaked in 2006 (Tables 3−4). Softer
domestic demand and robust growth in Turkey’s main trading partners should reduce the
current account deficit in 2007. External financing prospects are expected to remain benign,
underpinned by strong FDI, and reserves are projected to rise further. Even so, reserves
would remain below short-term external debt (at remaining maturity).

21
17.
Risks to this outlook are broadly balanced. The main downward risks to growth are
financial market and political turbulence. In this event, lower capital inflows, combined with
higher interest rates and a weaker currency, would dampen growth but reduce the current
account deficit. Conversely, the removal of election-related uncertainties (and, even more,
prospects for a strong, single-party government) could lift investor confidence and attract
large inflows, boosting growth but widening the current account deficit. Current account
developments will also depend significantly on commodity prices.
18.
Medium-term growth will largely depend on the pace and breadth of supply-side
reforms. With disciplined financial polices, but in the absence of renewed reform momentum,
growth is projected to settle at 5 percent from 2009 onward. This is consistent with a slight
increase in the capital-output ratio, a modest reversal of the secular decline in the (very low)
employment rate (as the pace of labor shedding in agriculture moderates), and an easing of
total factor productivity growth from recent record levels (Table 5). Higher long-term growth
would be attainable (in their current five-year economic plan, the authorities target 7 percent)
provided ambitious structural reforms are implemented (Section IV).

Long-term trends in the current account hinge, in turn, on growth prospects. In
the low-growth scenario, the current account deficit is expected to decline gradually,
supported by a modest recovery in domestic saving and a deceleration in investment. This
outcome is predicated on the current benign external outlook, improving overall fiscal
balances (as the interest bill declines), and broadly unchanged competitiveness. Under a
strong-reform scenario, high growth and attractive investment conditions would result in
large inflows and wider current account deficits. The authorities note, however, that in this
scenario stronger export sector productivity would be a mitigating factor. Financing
prospects appear favorable in either scenario provided market confidence is preserved.
IV. POLICIES TO ENTRENCH MACROECONOMIC STABILITY AND SUPPORT GROWTH
20.
Staff and the authorities agreed that the overall strategy for normalizing the
economy since 2001 had been appropriate and successful. The broad policy thrust—the
primary budget surplus as an anchor for fiscal policy, the goal of reducing inflation quickly,
and the substantial strengthening of bank supervision and bank’s balance sheets alongside
important structural reforms—had been strong and effective. However, there had been some

22
shortcomings in implementation: the composition of fiscal adjustment had relied too much on
revenue increases and capital spending restraint and some reforms had lagged initial
schedules (especially, expenditure rationalization, labor market deregulation, capital market
deepening, and privatization of public banks and energy companies). Thus, efforts in these
areas would need to be redoubled in the coming years.
21.
Looking ahead, it was also agreed that some redirection of macroeconomic and
structural policies is required.4 While the economy had responded well to the stabilization
shock and some further confidence gains were undoubtedly in store (particularly as inflation
falls further), other impetuses to growth will become increasingly important. From this
vantage point, entrenching stability and rejuvenating structural reform would be key pillars
of economic policy. On the former, discussions explored how and when the primary fiscal
surplus target could be eased, whether and in what timeframe an inflation target of 4 percent
could be achieved, what mix of macroeconomic policies would minimize upward pressures
on the lira, and how to protect the financial system from overheating under the impact of
large capital inflows. At the same time, it was recognized that Turkey will be entering a new
phase of economic development—one benefiting less from extraordinary cost
competitiveness and relying more on underlying structural factors. To this end, discussions
explored medium-term goals for a structural reform agenda.
22.
As the agenda is large, reforms need to be prioritized. Staff suggested giving
precedence to reforms that safeguard the fiscal (and external) position, such as structural
fiscal reforms and regulatory improvements to labor, financial, and product markets. The
authorities generally concurred, but placed particular priority on easing the heavy tax burden.
A. Fiscal Policy: Adapting to Evolving Needs
23.
Tight fiscal policy has been the
cornerstone of the macroeconomic strategy. High
primary surpluses (averaging 6.7 percent of GNP
since 2002) have supported private sector-led
growth by reducing debt ratios and enabling lower
interest rates and risk premiums.
24.
The fiscal adjustment has, however,
relied excessively on tax increases and
investment cuts, and too little on current
expenditure rationalization. There were
successful efforts to broaden the tax base and reduce
distortions (especially on income taxes). However,
recurrent ad-hoc tax and spending initiatives outside
of the budget cycle often required suboptimal

The discussions revealed at least qualitative agreement between the authorities and staff on most subjects. The
text below, therefore, mentions the respective views only where there were differences (or when the authorities

23
offsetting measures in the form of investment spending cuts or excise tax hikes. Last year,
large one-off revenues were used to accommodate higher spending; thus, the primary surplus
adjusted for exceptional items fell to around 5 percent of GNP—even though the headline
figure was 6.6 percent of GNP (Tables 6−7). This imposed a considerable adjustment in this
year’s budget, which is proving difficult to deliver.
25.
In the short term, keeping to the announced fiscal spending targets will help
confidence, support disinflation, and bolster domestic saving. This year, the authorities
blocked some 0.8 percent of GNP in outlays to (i) offset 2006 spending overruns (as per
program commitments), (ii) compensate for several unbudgeted initiatives, and (iii) close the
gap in the state enterprise balance opened by the failure to effect planned hikes in end-user
energy tariffs (Section IV.H). Implementation of these measures should enable a primary
surplus of some 6.7 percent of GNP. Achieving this target will, however, require resolve,
given the scale of the targeted adjustment in the underlying fiscal position, election-related
pressures, and indications of softening tax revenue.
26.
Looking further ahead, continued progress in debt reduction should allow a
gradual easing of the primary surplus. High real interest rates and the vulnerability of debt
dynamics to large shocks still argue for bringing the debt ratio to safer levels. Staff
recommends preserving the 6.5 percent of GNP primary surplus target in 2008, since some of
the reforms key to entrenching long-run fiscal sustainability, notably pension and civil
service reforms (see Section IV.G), are not yet in place. Such a surplus would also avoid an
unnecessary procyclical stimulus. The authorities are, however, eager to begin using fiscal
resources to reduce the high tax burden and increase investment spending. Staff projections
show that, absent shocks, it should be possible to reduce the primary surplus from 2009
onward while balancing the budget and generating fiscal space. Staff favors using this fiscal

27.
A well-designed fiscal rule could serve as an anchor amidst competing mediumterm fiscal objectives. Either an expenditure rule or a (balanced) budget rule would support
debt reduction. An expenditure rule combined with a debt target would, however, be more
conducive to expenditure restraint and, thus, to creating fiscal space for tax reforms (see
SIP). Stressing that the main problem has been an overly rapid expansion of current primary
spending, the authorities suggest exempting investment spending from such a rule. But staff
believes this might promote opportunistic reclassifications of expenditure. As to timing, the
authorities feel that it is still too early to replace the primary surplus target, which has been a
successful guide to fiscal policy, with an untested alternative.

Meanwhile, budget accountability and fiscal
transparency—key conditions for any successful
fiscal rule—are being improved. The public
financial management and control law adopted in
2003 needs to be implemented in full. This law aims
to enhance budget accountability and transparency,
including by requiring medium-term performancebased budgeting as well as the preparation of annual
accountability reports and a mid-year fiscal outlook.
The authorities are also making efforts to improve
fiscal transparency (Section V).

25
B. Monetary Policy: Disinflation Is the Primary Objective
29.
It was agreed that the 4 percent medium-term inflation target should be
preserved. With hindsight, a legitimate question is whether the inflation targets were too
ambitious given the large inflation overshooting. In particular, the 2005–07 targets may have
relied to a large extent on a continued lira appreciation. Conversely, it can also be argued that
monetary policy was too lose in late 2005−early 2006, as domestic demand was expanding
rapidly. Even so, it is unclear whether slightly higher targets would have altered policies and
outcomes significantly given the many unanticipated supply-side shocks. Going forward, there
was agreement that reducing and stabilizing inflation around the 4 percent target would help
reduce risk premiums and support growth.
30.
The near-term inflation outlook is dominated by upside risks. The central bank

31.
There is, therefore, little alternative to keeping monetary policy tight in the near
term. The level of interest rates is appropriate, as is the central bank’s tightening bias:
positive surprises about the inflation outlook should elicit no policy response, but negative
news should defer rate cuts or even lead to rate hike s. In this regard, the central bank noted
that a sudden reacceleration of credit growth would be a warning sign that the medium-term
target is at risk.
32.
Staff and the authorities concurred that, once inflation is on a firm downward
trend, interest rates could be cautiously reduced. Timing the start of the easing cycle is a
difficult task. The central bank stressed that the central scenario of beginning rate cuts in the
fourth quarter of 2007 is not a commitment, but a conditional statement. In the absence of
suitable leading indicators of inflationary pressures (wage data, for instance, are released
with significant lags) and in view of the predominantly backward-looking inflation
expectations, the central bank will focus on trends in actual inflation. Specifically, a
declining path of services inflation would suggest that inflationary pressures are subsiding
and that a gradual monetary easing could start.
33.
Preserving central bank independence and continuing to enhance the monetary
policy framework are crucial for securing low inflation. Before adopting formal inflation
targeting (IT) in January 2006, the central bank increased the transparency and accountability
of its monetary policy operations by making the timing of interest rate decisions predictable,
assigning responsibility for setting rates to the monetary policy committee, and announcing
issuance of a quarterly Inflation Report with medium-term inflation projections. The new IT
framework, however, quickly faced challenges, as a sharp depreciation of the lira and a series
of supply shocks led to a large breach of the inflation target. So long as inflation remains
above target, the central bank should keep explaining the reasons for the deviations, presenting
a realistic disinflation trajectory, and communicating policy intentions clearly. Regarding
independence, the central bank acknowledges that reserve accumulation has resulted in high
sterilization costs, which are affecting its income position. It stresses, however, that this will
not jeopardize its operational independence.
C. Should Policies Respond to Upward Pressure on the Lira?
34.
Rebalancing of policy mix (monetary easing with fiscal tightening) could, in
principle, alleviate upward pressure on the lira, but this was not seen as pressing with
the current account seemingly stabilizing. Fiscal policy is already quite tight and a further
tightening might not be credible. The central bank would also be wary of easing monetary
policy prematurely while inflation is still well above target. Even so, the strong lira argues
for keeping fiscal policy tight to create room for lowering high real interest rates. Beyond
this, it will be important to move forward with supply-side reforms to improve
competitiveness, and to build cushions in balance sheets to minimize disruptions from a
possible disorderly lira correction.

D. Asset and Liability Management: Reducing Risks in Public Balance Sheets
35.
The authorities are further strengthening public balance sheets to increase
resilience to external shocks. The Treasury’s strategy is to lengthen debt maturities further

The recent rapid growth of the financial system has facilitated economic
recovery but also created new challenges. Supportive economic conditions, reduced

intermediation. The banking system has been the main beneficiary, with increased foreign

The newly adopted mortgage law should foster financial intermediation. Over
time, this law should help (i) reduce banks’ maturity mismatches by introducing adjustablerate mortgages and (ii) increase competition from nonbank lenders by strengthening the
regulatory infrastructure for primary and secondary markets. Importantly, the authorities
overcame pressures to introduce tax deductibility of interest payments—which would have
distorted the allocation of savings and narrowed the tax base. However, the authorities agree
that a growing mortgage market could amplify economic cycles and fuel rapid credit growth
(see SIP). Strict supervision and prudent regulation of mortgage conditions (such as loan-tovalue ratios) are therefore needed.
38.
The authorities intend to remove other obstacles to financial development.

State bank privatization would increase efficiency. After many delays, the IPO for
20−25 percent of the government’s share in Halkbank is underway. Staff urged that the
residual government stake be sold within the next year and the privatization of Ziraat (the
second largest deposit-taking institution) launched at once. The authorities, however, are
reluctant to commit to specific plans, noting that Ziraat serves a social function as the only
financial institution with branches in rural areas.

The authorities plan to fiscalize losses from the banking crisis, which currently
encumber the deposit insurance agency’s (SDIF) balance sheet. The SDIF plans to

figures), enabling the agency to focus exclusively on its role as deposit insurer.

F. Reversing the Downward Trend in Saving
43.
Spurring domestic saving would make economic growth less dependent on
volatile foreign capital. The domestic saving rate has fallen, as higher public saving has
only partly offset a rapid decline in private saving. This trend chiefly reflects successful
macroeconomic stabilization since 2001 (see SIP). Although a certain recovery of saving
rates can be expected as income catch-up proceeds, supportive policies, including continued
fiscal prudence and pension reform, would help raising domestic saving. Steps to deepen
capital markets and develop private retirement saving plans are also promising.

G. Safeguarding Fiscal Solvency and Creating Fiscal Space
44.
Social security reform is critical to securing fiscal sustainability and reducing
labor market rigidities. Turkey’s mandatory pension systems offer the lowest retirement
ages (60 for men and 58 for women) and the second-highest benefits relative to preretirement earnings in the OECD. The average Turkish worker with a full career receives an
untaxed pension exceeding his/her net pre-retirement salary. Consequently, the pension
system spends over one-fourth of central government outlays and runs deficits of 3½ percent
of GNP, despite some of the highest social security contribution rates in the OECD.
Moreover, separate systems for civil servants, private sector employees, and the selfemployed hinder labor mobility across sectors. Comprehensive pension reform to rationalize
benefits, gradually raise retirement ages, and integrate systems is therefore essential to
securing long-run fiscal sustainability, creating fiscal space to ease the heavy labor tax
2
2
burden, and improving labor market flexibility.
Pension System Deficits
45.
The authorities intend to resurrect the
social security reform recently struck down by the
Constitutional Court. The government will publish
soon a white paper discussing alternative approaches
aimed at recapturing most of the 2006 reform’s
savings in constitutionally valid ways. A revised
reform should be adopted by mid-2008.

universal coverage, but this has preceded efficiency
gains, causing substantial health spending overruns in recent years. The authorities thus plan
to strengthen control over public hospital expenditure by setting hospital-by-hospital
quarterly budgetary targets. Simultaneously, they have begun implementing measures, such
as strengthening information technology and promoting the use of more cost-effective
treatments, to enhance the efficiency of health care provision. They also plan to reduce
frivolous demand by adjusting copayments.
47.
Expenditure rationalization and enhancements in tax administration would also
create fiscal space:
•

Civil servant expenses are high (over one-third of central government primary
spending) and could be streamlined through attrition and pay rationalization. The
authorities broadly agree with these goals, but consider that any legislative initiative
in this area would best be taken up by the new parliament.

•

There is substantial scope to improve revenue collection, especially by focusing
resources on the highest-yielding activities. In this regard, the recent establishment of
a Large Taxpayer Unit is welcome, as are commitments to strengthen its audit
capabilities, enhance collections of social security contributions, and deploy risk-

based audit techniques. Beyond this, integrating tax and social security contribution
collection will be critical to yield efficiency and compliance benefits.

The authorities agree on the need to rationalize onerous regulations and reduce
the labor tax burden. They are considering a combination of measures to reduce rigidities,
including easing restrictive hiring requirements for large firms. Staff cautioned against
increasing unemployment benefits and loosening eligibility requirements without adopting
sufficient complementary measures to ease the severance pay burden. Such actions would
pose fiscal risks (in terms of higher unemployment benefit costs) without easing labor market
rigidities.
Investment climate

20

50.
Despite recent progress, the authorities
concurred that the investment climate needs further
improvement. FDI has soared but remains
concentrated in banking, telecommunications, and real
estate. Priorities to buttress the investment climate
include: (i) entrenching economic stability;
(ii) advancing EU accession; (iii) reviving
privatization; and (iv) pursuing microeconomic
reforms, including easing product market regulations.

51.
Of special concern is the electricity sector,
where Turkey might face shortages by 2009−10 (Box 4). The finances of state-owned
energy enterprises have weakened considerably due largely to a freeze on end-user electricity
tariffs since 2002, while energy input costs have doubled. Investment has, therefore, lagged
behind infrastructure needs. Resumption of the privatization program (suspended in early
2007) and a strengthened tariff framework based on full cost recovery are thus essential to
secure adequate investment. The authorities are currently reassessing their energy strategy to
address these and other reform issues.
V. DATA ADEQUACY
52.
Although Turkey's statistical base is broadly adequate for effective surveillance,
national accounts data have shortcomings (Statistical Annex). GDP data understate
economic activity, and the expenditure-side composition is unreliable. The Turkish Statistical
Institute, which has been working on revisions for some time (supported by Fund TA),
intends to release new data later this year. Staff has advised the authorities to prepare the
release carefully with an appropriate communications strategy.7
53.
Fiscal transparency is slowly improving. The public’s capacity to assess fiscal
performance has been hampered by frequent account reclassifications that create breaks in
the historical series. The publication of consistent historical budget outturns under the new
classification system is therefore welcome. Efforts should now focus on ensuring consistency
and accessibility of fiscal reporting.
7

Confusion surrounding a recent revision of the CPI basket weights highlights, more generally, the need for
enhanced communications with the public.

34
VI. STAFF APPRAISAL
54.
Turkey's macroeconomic performance in recent years has been impressive.
Disciplined macroeconomic policies, strengthened economic institutions, and other structural
reforms have set off a virtuous cycle of disinflation, declining public debt, falling interest
rates, and high, private sector-led growth. Favorable external conditions, political stability,
and the government’s commitment to Fund arrangements and EU accession have facilitated
this good performance.
55.
Turkey faces, however, several economic and structural challenges that need to
be addressed to make the economy more resilient to shocks and lift its growth potential.
First, adjustment to the large imbalances inherited from the 2001 crisis should be completed,
including by reducing debt levels, bringing inflation down to low single digits, and
unwinding dollarization. Second, new vulnerabilities have emerged as byproducts of strong
growth, prospects for EU accession, and large capital inflows: wide current account deficits,
appreciating currency, and rapid credit growth. These vulnerabilities are unlikely to abate in
the near-term and need to be managed carefully to avoid the boom-bust cycles of the past.
Third, while inroads have been made on the structural front, the reform agenda is far from
complete: financial intermediation remains low; domestic savings are declining; long-term
fiscal spending pressures persist; the informal sector—where productivity lags—does not
show signs of shrinking; employment remains low; and bottlenecks in electricity supply
loom. The recent easing of growth calls for a decisive policy response to remove these
structural impediments to productivity and employment growth.
56.
External vulnerabilities need to be managed carefully to safeguard and extend
recent economic gains. The floating exchange rate continues to serve Turkey well, by acting
as a flexible shock absorber. Even so, the lira’s current strength—which does not yet appear
to have dented export competitiveness—heightens risks from sudden shifts in market
sentiment. While the economy has become more resilient to such swings (as evidenced by
the limited impact of last year’s financial market turbulence), a protracted and sharp lira selloff could prove disruptive. This puts a premium on continuing to build buffers in public and
private balance sheets and to improve liability structures (by lengthening maturities and
reducing foreign-currency funding).
57.
Now is the time to develop an ambitious reform agenda to place growth on the
high trajectory seen in the most dynamic emerging market economies. The immediate
post-election period will provide an opportunity to launch a new agenda of structural reform.
Priority should be given to measures that secure long-term fiscal savings and bolster
productivity and employment. Successful implementation of structural reforms, combined
with disciplined monetary and fiscal policies, would durably raise potential growth. This
would, in turn, reduce susceptibility to external shocks by improving the economy's ability to
sustain current account deficits and by tilting external financing toward more stable sources,
such as foreign direct investment.
58.
To this end, achieving low single-digit inflation is a fundamental policy priority.
The significant fall in inflation during the past five years has spurred confidence and
enhanced policy credibility. But it has not gone far enough, as residual inflation uncertainty

35
keeps real interest rates very high. The authorities should make a final push to entrench
inflation around the 4 percent target. From this perspective, the current tightening bias is
appropriate. Once inflation is firmly on a declining trend, however, interest rates should be
cautiously reduced. More generally, preserving central bank independence and enhancing
communications with markets will be essential for the success of the new inflation targeting
regime.
59.
Tight fiscal policy will help disinflation and buttress market confidence. The
sizable primary surpluses of recent years have produced enormous benefits, especially in
terms of debt reduction and declining real interest rates. Ensuring that policies are consistent
with a primary surplus outcome of at least 6.5 percent of GNP this year and next will
reinforce these trends, contain the current account deficit, and help shield the economy from
adverse shocks. The authorities are to be commended for taking steps to bring this year’s
fiscal policy back on track, and it will be crucial to keep spending in line with the
programmed path.
60.
Over the medium term, fiscal policy should be anchored around the objectives of
reducing public debt to safer levels and cutting highly distortionary taxes—particularly
on employment and financial transactions.This will require reversing a recent deterioration in
budget quality by keeping spending growth in check. Adopting an explicit fiscal rule (such as
a formal limit on spending growth or on the overall deficit) could help in this regard. To be
effective, any formal rule would need to be supported by improvements in public financial
management and fiscal transparency, as well as reforms to contain nondiscretionary
spending. On this issue, the priorities are to (i) adopt as soon as possible social security
legislation achieving similar savings to those targeted under the 2006 reform struck down by
the Constitutional Court; (ii) increase health spending efficiency; and (iii) rationalize civil
service pay.
61.
Reforms to improve tax collection are also essential to creating fiscal space.
Despite advances in this area in the context of the Fund-supported program, the outstanding
agenda is still large. Efforts should focus on consolidating audit functions under the Revenue
Administration, making the Large Taxpayer Unit fully effective, and improving social
security collections.
62.
Future growth will depend critically on increasing employment and labor
productivity through comprehensive labor market reforms. Easing high levels of labor
regulation and taxation should lower unemployment, increase labor force participation, and
reduce the large informal sector. However, reforms will have to be carefully designed to be
affordable and avoid expanding unemployment insurance without scaling down considerably
the mandatory severance pay regime.
63.
Policies to deepen financial intermediation and preserve the soundness of the
financial system should be pursued in tandem. Foreign penetration into the banking
system and mortgage liberalization are expected to spur competition and deepen
intermediation. The authorities should now concentrate on (i) abolishing financial transaction
taxes; (ii) privatizing state banks; and (iii) adopting insurance and capital market legislation.
However, while financial deepening is welcome from a growth perspective, too rapid credit

36
growth is bound to raise the risk profile of the financial system. It is, therefore, essential to
build additional cushions in balance sheets by further tightening banks’ general provisions,
which are low compared to other countries, and increasing coverage and timeliness of
corporate balance sheet data. Supervisors should also step up oversight, focusing on riskbased supervision and prompt corrective actions when individual banks assume excessive
risks.
64.
Privatization and microeconomic reforms, with a special focus on the energy
sector, will help attract investment and boost productivity. The recent surge in FDI is
very welcome, but it has been concentrated in a few service sectors. Further reforms are
needed to make Turkey more widely attractive to investors, including reviving privatization
and deregulating product markets. The risk of electricity shortfalls gives particular urgency to
attracting new investment and increasing efficiency in the energy sector by privatizing
electricity distribution companies and allowing better cost-recovery pricing.
65.
Opportunities for the Turkish economy are enormous. The goal should be to build
on the economic success of the last five years to firmly entrench high growth, secure low
inflation, and make the economy more flexible and resilient to external shocks. Continued
disciplined fiscal and monetary policies complemented by bold structural reforms are
essential for durable strong growth. The agenda is ambitious and some reforms could face
resistance, but the reward will be sustained improvements in living standards.
66.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held according to the
provisions applying to countries under Fund arrangements.

37
Box 1. The Stand-By Arrangement
Good progress has been made in achieving the ambitious macroeconomic goals in the current three-year
SBA. The program aimed to entrench 5 percent growth, reduce inflation to low single digits, contain the
current account deficit, and cut the public sector net debt ratio by 10 percentage points. The growth and debt
objectives were exceeded by large margins, but performance on inflation and the current account fell short.
The wider current account deficit reflected higher oil prices, above-program growth, and favorable global
financial conditions, which supported strong capital inflows and lira appreciation.
The program’s policy mix was broadly appropriate, although implementation was sometimes uneven:
•

On the fiscal side, the 6.5 percent of GNP primary surplus target was largely observed, but buoyant
revenues were spent despite formal commitments to save revenue overperformance. Budget quality also
weakened with ad hoc initiatives necessitating investment cuts or hikes in already high excise taxes.

•

On the monetary side, the transition to the IT regime helped increase transparency, though the early large
breach of the targets required enhancements in the communications strategy. To this end, the open
inflation letters were seen as effective in explaining the reasons behind the inflation overshooting and the
central bank’s strategy for bringing inflation down to targets.

Progress was made on structural reform, though not without delays and compromises. The program
sought to improve the long-term fiscal position and budget quality (social security reform, broader tax base,
and stronger collection), privatize state banks, strengthen bank supervision, and improve the investment climate.
•

Tax reforms. The cut in the corporate income tax rate (from 30 to 20 percent), combined with a phaseout of investment tax allowances, was successful in broadening the tax base to finance lower tax rates. By
contrast, the expansion in the personal income tax base was limited, as taxing agriculture and pension
income was rejected for political reasons. Cuts in financial transaction taxes were also not undertaken, as
extra revenues were used to increase expenditure. There were advances in tax administration, which is
key in light of widespread informality and low compliance, especially the establishment of an autonomous
Revenue Administration, a large taxpayer unit, and a new tax policy unit at the Finance Ministry. Making
these institutions effective has, however, required more time than envisaged.

•

Pension reform. The parametric pension reform passed in 2006 was to deliver backloaded savings, but
represented a good attempt at restoring the long-run viability of the pension system. It was, however,
annulled by the Constitutional Court.

•

Banking measures. The supervisory framework was modernized through passage of a new banking law
and the reorganization of the bank supervisory body. A new mortgage law was adopted in early 2007,
with the government resisting demands to make mortgage interest tax deductible. State bank reforms took
longer than envisaged, especially privatization plans.

•

Investment climate. Some of the largest and most profitable enterprises were privatized, despite repeated
legal challenges. This, together with other improvements in the investment climate, helped boost FDI to
record levels, alleviating concerns about the quality of external financing. The abrupt cancellation of the
privatization of energy distribution companies earlier this year, however, generated doubts about the
government’s commitment to future privatization.

The program failed to recognize early on the macro-criticality of some microeconomic issues. For
example, the welcome expansion of health care access took place ahead of measures to increase efficiency,
straining the budget. Consequently, new conditionality had to be introduced to curb unnecessary demand and
excessive supply of health services. In the energy sector, SEEs failed to pass onto final users substantial
increases in their energy costs. Together with chronic collection and theft/loss problems, this had negative
fiscal implications and held back investment needed to avoid looming electricity shortages.

Box 3. Turkey’s Informal Sector
Turkey has a large informal sector, with unregistered businesses employing half of Turkey’s workers—
about 75 percent of which are in small firms of 1−4 employees. Many registered firms are only “semiformal,” in that they underreport sales and employment. In all, the informal sector accounts for roughly a third
of Turkey’s economy.
The overall rate of informal employment has been broadly flat, but within the non-agriculture sector,
informality has been rising. This is partly due to successive minimum wage hikes (almost 50 percent in real
terms during 2001−06), but also to steep social insurance contributions, stringent labor and product market
regulations, and weak tax administration.

Box 4. Developments in the Energy Sector
Turkey’s electricity sector is dominated by state economic enterprises (SEEs). Although there is
substantial private sector participation in electricity generation—these companies either produce for their
own consumption or sell electricity to SEEs—the transmission and distribution sectors are essentially
controlled by SEEs.
In recent years, higher energy production costs have not been passed through to final users.
Electricity production in Turkey relies heavily on natural gas, whose price has risen sharply in recent
years. Hydro-based plants have provided some buffer, but below-average rainfall has recently constrained
use of this energy source. Meanwhile, end-user tariffs have not been raised since 2002. Consequently,
household tariffs are now low by international standards. Industry tariffs have also fallen in relative terms
but remain elevated, reflecting substantial cross-subsidization.

SEEs’ financial difficulties have been further compounded by theft and poor collections. Total
system losses are almost three times the OECD average (in certain regions, loss ratios exceed 60 percent).
Collections are also weak, often reflecting political interference (arrears by municipalities are very large)
and poor compliance arising from repeated amnesties.
Urgent steps are needed to address the energy sector’s financial problems. The SEEs’ tight finances
have led to persistent underinvestment in critical infrastructure. Consequently, official estimates suggest
that electricity shortages may emerge as soon as 2009 and substantial capital investment is needed.
A prompt resumption of the aborted privatization program is critical. Successful privatization of
distribution and, subsequently, generation companies will require firm commitments to bring end-user
tariffs back in line with the stated principle of full cost recovery and to avoid interfering with the pricing
mechanism.

(Percent of GNP)

Sources: Turkish authorities; and IMF staff estimates.
1/ Spending is increased by 1 month of transfer of revenue shares to make data comparable with other years.
2/ Social Security Institutions plus budget spending on social security (such as civil servants' health and Green Card).
3/ Consolidated central government and social security spending (corresponds to program monitored spending).
4/ Measured as health spending by the Social Security Institution and budget for Green Card and civil servants. This
is not a comprehensive measure of health spending, and underestimates spending as it excludes some items (such
as Ministry of Health spending on medical personnel salaries).

APPENDIX I: EXTERNAL DSA
In the absence of shocks, the external debt ratio is projected to stay broadly flat over the
medium term.
1.
The gross external debt ratio is projected to stay at 50 to 55 percent of GNP in
the medium term (Table I.1).1 This reflects a number of offsetting influences, as a gradually
narrowing current account deficit helps to reduce the debt-to-GNP ratio, while some fall-off
in FDI (nondebt financing) after the 2006−07 surge and somewhat slower growth of real
output after 2008 work to increase it. This baseline also assumes that the central bank will
continue to increase its gross international reserves (financed in part by external debt) in
order to strengthen its coverage of short-term liabilities and reduce vulnerabilities.
2.
External debt remains vulnerable to standardized shocks (Figure I.1). Turkey’s
history of macroeconomic volatility implies that the standardized debt sustainability tests are
particularly demanding. A permanent ½ standard deviation growth shock would put the debt
ratio on an upward trajectory over 2008–12 and lead to an increase of 8 percentage points in
the gross external debt ratio by 2012. A permanent current account shock of ½ standard
deviation would have a somewhat larger effect (11 percentage points), as would a ¼ standard
deviation joint shock to growth, the current account, and interest rates (10 percentage points).
A real depreciation shock of 30 percent in 2008 would cause the gross external debt ratio to
jump almost 25 percentage points to 77 percent, before declining gradually over the medium
term. While the sensitivity of the external debt ratio to exchange rate shocks is large, the
depreciation of the exchange rate would likely lead to a significant reversal of the current
account deficit and improved medium-term debt ratios—a dynamic not captured in this debt
sustainability exercise.

External debt refers to current, non-contingent claims by nonresidents on residents in the form of loans, bonds,
leases, etc. It is assumed that: (i) securities issued abroad, e.g., Eurobonds, are held by nonresidents;
(ii) domestically issued securities denominated in foreign currencies are held by residents.

APPENDIX II: PUBLIC DSA
1.
Debt ratios fell further in 2006 and are expected to continue declining in the near
term, notwithstanding elevated interest rates. Stress tests show that medium-term debt
sustainability hinges on continued fiscal discipline: sticking to high primary surpluses would
help prevent explosive debt dynamics in the face of large shocks. In contrast, fiscal policy
complacency by itself could set in motion an adverse scenario of higher interest rates and
lower growth that would place public debt on an unsustainable path.

45 percent of GNP,
respectively (Box II.1).
3.
The baseline scenario targets a net debt ratio at 27½ percent of GNP by 2012—
corresponding to a consolidation of over 17 percentage points in 6 years (Table II.1,
panel A). In the absence of shocks, this scenario is consistent with a declining primary
surplus, from 6.5 percent of GNP to 5.5 percent in 2009, and further down to 3 percent by
2012. Real interest rates are conservatively assumed to stay around 10 percent.
4.
Stress tests show that debt dynamics could become unsustainable if fiscal
discipline is abandoned or a combination of very large shocks occurs (Figure II.1 and
Table II.1, panels B and C).
•

Deterioration in global environment (C1). This scenario assumes an unexpected
slowdown in global growth combined with a sharp tightening of global liquidity,
which triggers a rise in risk aversion toward emerging markets. Consequently, the lira
would depreciate by 30 percent in 2007, interest rates would increase by 500 bps in
2007–08, and growth would fall to 2½ percent in both years. From 2009–12, interest
rates would start to ease again (by 100 bps each year), and growth would gradually
return to its baseline. If the primary surplus remains at the baseline, the net debt ratio
would increase to over 47 percent of GNP by 2010 and then decline gradually in the
following years.

Domestic policy complacency (C3). This scenario assumes that, instead of the
gradual easing of the primary surplus in the outer years, the primary surplus is cut to
3 percent of GNP starting in 2007 and structural reforms are no longer pursued,
including an immediate halt of privatization, so that real interest rates increase
permanently. While the initial fiscal stimulus helps to maintain output in the first
year, growth then falls to a lower trend rate in the following period. Taken together,
this sets debt dynamics on an explosive path, raising the debt ratio to over 65 percent
by 2012.

55

Box II.1: Turkey’s Sovereign Risk Profile
Turkey’s sovereign risk has improved considerably in recent years, reflecting strong economic
performance and overall benign financial market conditions. Debt has fallen to 45 percent of GNP
from over 90 percent in 2001 in net terms, and roughly one-quarter is denominated in foreign currency.
As a result, credit spreads have declined.

Despite greater resilience to moderate shocks, Turkey’s sovereign rating could suffer from episodes
of pronounced market turbulence. The contingent claims approach suggests that a shock of the same
order of magnitude as that observed in May−June 2006 (“volatile scenario”)—entailing lira depreciation,
a rise in T-bill rates, and a decline in stock prices by 20 percent—should increase the sovereign’s external
default probability somewhat. However, Turkey would probably maintain its current BB rating, judging
from historical sovereign default probabilities. By contrast, a more extreme bout of market turbulence
(“volatile scenario 2”), as observed in early 2003, would worsen Turkey’s risk profile to the level of a
single B rating. Importantly, these simulations assume continued policy discipline—any departure from
the prudent policy stance that has enabled recent improvements in sovereign risk could seriously
compound the fallout from market volatility.
Further debt reduction would help strengthen Turkey’s risk profile. For instance, a reduction in
external debt induced by fiscal savings of 2 percent of GNP over a five year period could sufficiently
improve Turkey’s debt profile to warrant an upgrade to a BBB rating. Estimates also suggest that if the
same amount of fiscal savings were used to reduce domestic debt, credit spreads would decline by over
100 basis points.

9/ Assumes a 30 percent depreciation in 2007, and a 500 bps increase in real interest rates in 2007−08, which reduces growth to 2.5 percent in these years. From 2009−12 interest rates will gradually ease 100 bps each year, while
growth gradually accelerates to its 5 percent trend.
10/ Assumes a 50 percent depreciation in 2007, interest rates above baseline by 1000 and 500 bps in 2007 and 2008, respectively, and zero growth in 2007. Baseline assumptions for 2008−12.
11/ Assumes that starting in 2007 the primary fiscal balance is permanently reduced to 3 percent, privatizations are cancelled (zero receipts) and real interest rates permanently rise by 4 percentage points. As a result, annual
growth drops permanently to 2.5 percent (beginning in 2008) and the annual lira depreciation is faster than under baseline.

ANNEX I. TURKEY: STATISTICAL INFORMATION
1.
Data provision to the Fund is broadly adequate for surveillance and program
monitoring purposes, despite certain shortcomings. Turkey subscribes to the Special Data
Dissemination Standard (SDDS).
Real sector statistics
2.
Data on producer and consumer prices are published monthly, with a very short lag.
Monthly data on industrial production is published with a lag of five to six weeks, while
quarterly national accounts are published with a 2-3 month lag. The Turkish Statistical
Institute (Turkstat) publishes national accounts in current and constant prices for the
production and expenditure approaches to gross domestic product (GDP) and in current
prices for the income approach. In SDDS metadata, Turkstat indicates that GDP estimated
using the production approach is the principal measure of GDP. The national accounts are
compiled in accordance with the 1968 System of National Accounts (1968 SNA)
methodology.
3.
The national accounts data suffer from an outdated base year (1987), the use of valueadded ratios that have been maintained constant for several industries since the last
benchmark year (1990), annual surveys that are not timely and not used as an input for the
GDP estimates, and the use of single―instead of double―deflation to estimate GDP by
production at constant prices. A project is underway to align compilation of the national
accounts to the 1993 SNA methodology and implement the main recommendations from the
2001 Data Module of the Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (Data ROSC):
(1) introduction of annual industrial survey results to the GDP data; (2) improved estimation
and deflation of output and household consumption; (3) disaggregated deflation of trade in
services and inclusion of shuttle trade in exports of goods; and (4) improvement in the
estimation of selected aggregates.
4.
There is a wide range of data on labor market developments, with the biannual
Household Labor Force Survey (HLFS) replaced with a monthly survey at the beginning of
2000. These new data are published quarterly with a three month lag. Coverage of wage
developments in the private sector has improved significantly through the use of quarterly
surveys of the manufacturing sector.
Government finance statistics
5.
Budgetary data are published monthly, with a lag of some 2−3 weeks. Coverage of
the budget is incomplete, with sizable fiscal operations conducted through extra budgetary
funds, for which data are available only with long lags. Fiscal analysis is further complicated
by the omission of certain transactions from the fiscal accounts; failure to account for sizable
quasi-fiscal operations carried out by state banks and state economic enterprises (SEEs); and
technical problems associated with consolidating the cash-based accounts of governmental
entities with the accrual-based accounting of SEEs. It is difficult to reconcile fiscal data with
monetary and BOP data, especially in the accounting of external debt flows and central

3
government deposits. Under the IBRD-financed Public Financial Management Project
(PFMP), the authorities are to adopt an improved budget coding system, a chart of accounts,
and a new debt management database.
6.
Turkey reports fiscal data for publication in Government Finance Statistics Yearbook.
The latest data available are for 2001 and cover the central government budgetary sector
(including annex budget units). Data are not provided for extrabudgetary and social security
units. No monthly and quarterly data are being reported for publication in International
Financial Statistics.
Monetary and financial statistics
7.
Data on the central bank balance sheet, and provisional data on the main monetary
aggregates and total domestic credit, are published weekly, with a one- and two-week lag,
respectively. Data on the monetary survey and deposit interest rates are published monthly,
with about a two-to-three-month lag. The CBT does not expect to meet the SDDS timeliness
requirement for the analytical accounts of the banking sector in the short term due to delays
in the preparation of year-end bank balance sheets and ongoing restructuring in the banking
system. The CBT reports monthly data to STA with about a three-to-four-month lag.
8.
STA and EUR use different measures of the monetary authorities’ net foreign assets,
reflecting in part UFR treatment of central bank foreign currency-denominated liabilities to
resident banks as foreign liabilities of the central bank. Differences also stem from the use of
program exchange rates in EUR’s presentation, while market exchange rates are used in IFS.
External sector statistics
9.

In line with SDDS prescriptions Turkey disseminates:

•

monthly balance of payments (BOP) statistics with a 2−3 month lag;

•

weekly international reserves with a one-week lag;

•

monthly data on the template on international reserves and foreign currency liquidity
(reserve template) within one month after the reference period;

•

monthly merchandise trade data with one to two months lag;

•

quarterly external debt with one quarter lag; and,

•

annual international investment position (IIP) data with a six months lag.

10.
The central bank reports quarterly BOP data to STA with about four months lag.
Balance of payments and IIP statistics are compiled in broad conformity with the conceptual
framework of the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual (BPM5). The CBT
periodically reviews the bank’s foreign exchange records to redress, to the extent possible,
problems of coverage and misclassification using supplemental data sources and estimation
techniques.

This schedule presents all currently scheduled payments to the IMF, including repayment expectations and
repayment obligations. The IMF Executive Board can extend repayment expectations (within predetermined
limits) upon request by the debtor country if its external payments position is not strong enough to meet the
expectations without undue hardship or risk (see repayment schedules and IMF lending for details).

Safeguard Assessments:
In accordance with the Fund’s safeguards policy, a new assessment of the CBT’s
safeguards framework was conducted under the current SBA. This assessment was
completed on June 29, 2005. While it uncovered no material weaknesses in the
CBT’s safeguard framework, a few recommendations were made to address some
remaining vulnerabilities in the areas of internal audit and controls. Those
recommendations have been implemented.

This schedule is not the currently applicable schedule of payments to the IMF. Rather, the schedule presents all
payments to the IMF under the illustrative assumption that repayment expectations—except for SRF repayment
expectations—would be extended to their respective obligation dates by the IMF Executive Board upon request
of the debtor country (see repayment schedules and IMF lending for details). SRF repayment expectations are
shown on their current expectation dates, unless already converted to an obligation date by the IMF Executive
Board.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2007 Article IV Consultation with Turkey
On May 18, 2007, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Turkey.1
Background
Turkey has experienced an impressive economic revival in recent years. Sound economic
policies anchored to Fund arrangements, as well as political stability and favorable external
conditions, have resulted in average annual growth of 7½ percent since 2002. Private
consumption and investment have been the main drivers, fueled by declining real interest rates,
surging capital inflows, rapid credit expansion, and rising productivity. Meanwhile, inflation has
dropped dramatically over the past five years.
The real economy has undergone significant modernization, becoming less reliant on traditional
sectors and more open to trade and foreign investment. Exports have continued to gain market
shares, as the effects of an appreciating currency have been largely offset by productivity gains.
Slack in the labor market has kept labor costs in check.
Balance sheets have also strengthened. Public debt ratios have come down considerably, and
the composition of debt has improved. Bank balance sheets have also become more robust.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
These positive outcomes have been driven, in large part, by disciplined policies and advances
in structural reforms. On the macroeconomic side, adherence to the 6.5 percent of GNP primary
surplus target combined with monetary policy restraint by an independent central bank have
helped bring down inflation, strengthen confidence, and ease real interest rates. The floating
exchange rate has been an effective shock absorber and has provided good incentives for
managing currency risks. On the structural side, bank recapitalization and enhanced
supervision, tax reforms, and privatization have restarted private credit growth, promoted FDI,
and spurred competitiveness.
Still, the Turkish economy faces a number of macroeconomic challenges. In particular, the
economy’s dependence on large capital inflows exposes Turkey to swings in investor sentiment
(as witnessed during recent periods of market turbulence). Also, inflation well above target (due
to a series of supply shocks, currency depreciation, and inertia in expectations) continues to
require tight monetary policy. And, in order to sustain and build on recent improvements in
growth, a number of structural challenges need to be tackled. These include a low employment
rate, still limited financial intermediation, a large informal sector, and potential bottlenecks in
electricity supply.
Executive Board Assessment
Turkey’s macroeconomic performance in recent years has been impressive, combining
strong growth with a sustained reduction of inflation. This owed much to the authorities’
disciplined macroeconomic policies, strengthened economic institutions, and structural reforms,
in a context of favorable external conditions, political stability, and firm commitment to Fund
arrangements. Directors considered, however, that Turkey needs to manage vulnerabilities
carefully and address structural challenges to increase the economy’s growth potential and
resilience to shocks.
Directors welcomed the significant progress made in addressing the large imbalances
inherited from the 2001 crisis. They called on the authorities to build on this progress by further
reducing public debt and bringing inflation to the low single digits. They observed that new
vulnerabilities have arisen as a byproduct of the recent strong performance. In particular, large
capital inflows fuel lira appreciation and a widening current account deficit, exposing Turkey to
sudden shifts in market sentiment. This calls for maintaining fiscal and monetary discipline and
preserving the floating exchange rate as a useful shock absorber. It also puts a premium on
continuing to build buffers in balance sheets and improve financing structures. In this regard,
Directors supported the authorities’ plan to increase gradually and predictably the level of
international reserves.
Directors agreed that a tight fiscal policy has been key to achieving the primary fiscal
surpluses and the recent economic successes, but considered that too much reliance may have
been placed on revenue increases and investment restraint. Going forward, fiscal discipline—
possibly underpinned by a fiscal rule—will continue to be needed to reduce debt, support
disinflation, and buttress market confidence. Tight control over current spending will facilitate

3
efforts to ease the heavy tax burden, especially on labor and financial transactions. Noting the
spending overruns in early 2007, Directors welcomed the plans to bring the fiscal position back
on track, and encouraged the authorities to adhere closely to them in order to achieve the 2007
primary surplus target of 6.7 percent of GNP.
Directors supported the measures to increase fiscal transparency and the reform of
personal income taxation. They called for further fiscal reforms to contain nondiscretionary
spending. Revised social security legislation that preserves the savings targeted in the 2006
reform law should be adopted as soon as possible. Social services efficiency should be
improved, and civil service pay rationalized. Continued reforms to improve tax collection will be
essential to create fiscal space. In that connection, Directors called for continued efforts to
reduce fragmentation in tax administration and make the large taxpayer unit fully effective.
Directors underscored the importance of achieving a low single-digit inflation rate to
reduce still-high real interest rates. They endorsed the central bank’s tight monetary stance, and
its intention to defer interest rate cuts until inflation is firmly on a path toward the 4 percent
target. Directors emphasized that preserving central bank independence will be essential for the
success of inflation targeting.
Directors stressed the need to deepen financial intermediation while preserving the
soundness of the financial system. They commended the authorities for adopting the mortgage
law and beginning the privatization of Halkbank. To ensure that rapid credit growth does not
compromise bank soundness, they called for stepping up supervisory oversight, tightening
provisioning requirements further, and improving the timeliness of corporate balance sheet data.
Directors considered that removing impediments to employment creation and labor
productivity growth is crucial for enhancing the economy’s growth potential, with an easing of
labor regulation a priority. Reductions in labor taxes are needed, provided that they do not
compromise the debt reduction objective. Directors encouraged the authorities to advance the
privatization program. Restructuring the energy sector, by privatizing electricity distribution
companies and allowing better cost-recovery pricing, will be particularly important.

Statement by Willy Kiekens, Executive Director for Turkey
and Levent Veziroglu, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
May 18, 2007

In the last five years economic management in Turkey has been successful. The policy
anchors provided by the IMF supported programs and by the EU accession negotiations have
been very helpful. The Turkish authorities are grateful for the close collaboration with Fund
staff and for the support shown by Management and the Executive Board.
Fiscal consolidation and reforms to improve economic governance and investment conditions
have transformed the Turkish economy. Public debt has been significantly reduced, as has
been inflation. Confidence increased and risk premia dropped. Investment by residents and
foreigners has been buoyant and GDP growth strong and sustained.
Encouraging as these developments have been, remaining challenges must be addressed.
Turkey’s ambition is to achieve rapid real convergence with income levels in the European
Union. This requires preserving and strengthening macroeconomic stability and further
transforming the economy to effectively use all its resources and boost productivity.
Current Account Deficit
The authorities are closely monitoring developments in the current account. The deficit
which stood at 7.9 percent of GDP in 2006, is projected to narrow from this year on. During
the last four years Turkey’s production sector has started using more imported technological
and intermediate goods. This led to increased imports, but also helped increase exports. Since
last year, export growth in volume terms has exceeded that of imports. Staff projects that
from this year onwards, export growth will outpace import growth in both volume and value
terms.
When assessing the current account position we should of course not neglect how the deficit
has been financed. Developments in this regard have been positive since FDI now covers half
of the deficit. The remainder is increasingly financed by credit to the export industry. Thus,
both the dynamics of the current account and its financing provide reason for confidence.
Nonetheless, the authorities are committed to take any necessary measure if the current
account were to worsen.
Fiscal Policy
Continuing fiscal prudence and maintaining a high primary surplus is the main policy anchor
for the Turkish economy. Fiscal performance during the last four years has been outstanding,

2
with an average public sector primary surplus of 6.5 percent of GNP. The authorities are
determined to preserve their hard-won credibility with respect to fiscal discipline.
In 2006 the primary surplus was 6.6 percent. Although this is exemplary by any standard, it
fell 0.7 percentage point short of the revised program target. Nonetheless, this outcome did
not hamper any program objectives, as is evidenced by the continuous decline in the net
public debt ratio which is now 45 percent of GNP, well ahead of the program projections.
The authorities would therefore like to request a waiver for missing the relevant performance
criterion.
As pointed out, fiscal rigor remains a pillar of the government’s program. For 2007, the
primary surplus is targeted at 6.7 percent. To secure this outcome the authorities have taken
fiscal measures equivalent to 0.83 percent of GNP, to offset both the 2006 expenditure
overrun and the slippages in the first quarter of 2007. The authorities are keen to adhere to
fiscal discipline despite the elections scheduled for July 2007.
Fiscal policy is of course not limited to expenditure measures. Important steps have been
taken to reduce tax rates while broadening the tax base. An autonomous Revenue
Administration was established including a large tax payers’ unit. The problem of staffing
this unit has been addressed by appointing 37 auditors. As a result, revenue collection is
expected to improve.
Social Security
The Constitutional Court has annulled some provisions in the new social security law. In
response, the government has decided in favor of a modified reform which respects the
constitutional ruling while preserving the main elements and the estimated savings of the
original reform. These new proposals will soon be published in a White Paper and the reform
is expected to be implemented by mid 2008.
Monetary Policy
After 30 years of high inflation, Turkey has succeeded in reducing inflation to slightly below
10 percent. Reducing inflation further has been difficult. In April 2007, consumer prices rose
by 1.21 percent, and year-on-year inflation reached 10.72 percent. Price stickiness in the
services sector and prices for energy and unprocessed food largely explain developments in
the overall price level. And although the pass-through of the exchange rate depreciation in
spring 2006 has moderated, some lagged effects still persist. The disinflation process is
expected to continue in the coming months, converging, by the second quarter of 2008, to 4
percent as the mid-point of the targeted range for inflation.

3
The tight monetary policy stance was maintained during the first quarter of 2007 because of
prevailing uncertainties in the global economy, and uncertainties regarding the lagged effects
of monetary tightening. The delayed impact of the tight monetary policy stance on domestic
demand suggests that demand conditions are critical for disinflation.
There are several risks to the disinflation process, such as backward looking price setting and
stronger than expected inflation inertia, including the stickiness of inflation expectations.
Nonetheless, the CBT is confident that inflation expectations will come down gradually as
the headline inflation eases. The CBT signals that it will keep its cautious monetary stance
for an extended period.
The CBT continued its preannounced daily foreign exchange buying auctions in the first
quarter of the year in order to absorb the excess foreign exchange supply. Gross reserves now
exceed 15 percent of GNP.
Financial Sector
The 2005 banking law has brought the supervisory framework up to best international
practices. In the last four years, prudential regulation and supervision have been significantly
upgraded. Supervision is conducted on a consolidated basis. Weak banks have been
restructured, recapitalized, merged or closed. Public banks have been restructured both
financially and operationally. Capital adequacy ratios are now among the highest in emerging
market countries. Open foreign currency positions are well within prudential limits. The level
of non-performing loans is low.
The Turkish authorities found the recent Financial Sector Assessment Program highly useful.
Its recommendations have been considered carefully and some have already been
implemented, including raising required general provisions, strengthening the minimum
capital adequacy ratio, issuing inflation indexed debt and adopting a mortgage credit law.
The entry of foreign financial institutions in Turkey is strengthening competitiveness and
improving management practices. Credit growth is very high, considerable financial
deepening being under way. Obviously, banking supervision will need to keep up with new
developments and constantly update its capacity, in-step with developments in the financial
sector.
A New Mortgage Credit Law
The recently adopted mortgage credit law will contribute to the expansion of housing credit.
It also provides for improved monitoring of financial sector developments. The authorities
did not favor tax incentives for mortgage loans as this could have been both costly for the
budget and a source of distortion in the housing market.

4
Privatizing Halkbank
The public share offering of 25 percent of Halkbank, the second largest state-owned bank,
yielded US$ 1.80 billion. The sale shows confidence in the robustness and prospects for the
Turkish economy in a critical election year. With this sale Turkey complied with a prior
action for the completion of this review. These results will certainly be carefully evaluated
when planning the next steps for privatizing state banks.
Increasing the Role of the Private Sector and Improving the Business Environment
A wide range of measures has been taken to enhance the role of the private sector and
improve the investment climate. This would further improve medium-term growth and
employment prospects. Various legislative changes have been made in key sectors with a
view to increasing market efficiency. To this end, the energy, telecommunications and
tobacco sectors have been deregulated.
Reforms have significantly improved the investment environment. A key achievement has
been limiting bureaucracy. The time required to register a company is now less than one
week. In many cases the formalities can be processed in one day, well below the OECD
average.
The improved FDI regime was reflected in some recent highly successful large
privatizations. In the last three years, Turkey attracted almost US$ 33 billion FDI, of which a
record US$ 20.2 billion in 2006 alone. In the first quarter of 2007, FDI was US$ 9.2 billion.
Turkey’s international direct investment base is growing very fast. More than 15,000
companies with international capital are now operating in the country.
Labor Market Reform and Employment
Although the level of unemployment has remained unchanged for the last couple of years,
the number of employed has been increasing. The economy has been going through a
transformation, with a shift from agriculture to services and industry. While it was the
dominant sector in the past, the number of people working in agriculture is now shrinking
rapidly.
However, Turkey needs to improve labor market flexibility if the recent strong growth
performance is to absorb unemployment. A strategy to achieve this goal will be developed in
consultation with the Fund staff and consistently with the fiscal framework.
