ST. KITTS AND NEVIS
Staff Report for the 2007 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2007 Consultation with
St. Kitts and Nevis
Approved by Markus Rodlauer (WHD) and Matthew Fisher (PDR)

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Political context: St. Kitts and Nevis form a twin-island federation with a unicameral parliament. In the October 2004
elections, the incumbent Labor Party was re-elected with a large majority. The next election is due in 2009 but could take
place earlier. The Nevis Reformation Party returned to power in Nevis in July 2006 after 14 years in opposition.
Background: The economic rebound continued in 2006, but showed signs of weakening in 2007. The public debt-toGDP ratio—at about 185 percent as of end-2006—leaves little room for maneuver in the event of an adverse shock. In
the 2006 budget, the authorities announced a strategy to restore fiscal and debt sustainability, in conjunction with
transition out of sugar production. The fiscal stabilization program has borne fruit, with a primary surplus expected in
2007 for the third consecutive year, although there has been some fiscal loosening relative to 2006.
External competitiveness: Although the real effective exchange rate and medium-term current account deficits are
broadly in line with fundamentals, maintaining competitiveness remains challenging. Fiscal consolidation will be
important for supporting competitiveness, maintaining stability, and underpinning the quasi-currency board arrangement.
Discussions focused on the key challenges facing St. Kitts and Nevis:
• Restoring fiscal and debt sustainability. Further efforts are needed to put debt on a solid downward path and
achieve the government’s goal of a primary surplus of 8 percent of GDP by 2010. The authorities broadly agreed with the
mission’s recommendations, including comprehensive tax reforms, expenditure restraint, enhanced debt management and
oversight of public enterprises, and tapping more concessional financing (e.g., European Union sugar grants).
• Enhancing competitiveness and growth. There was broad consensus on the need to accelerate structural reforms—
especially enhancing the business climate, improving labor market flexibility, and strengthening regional integration—to
promote private sector-led growth. The authorities recognized the urgency of divesting government land/assets for more
productive uses, but have faced resistance to selling off the nation’s “patrimony.”
• Containing risks. The high and rising government exposure of the banking system warrants close monitoring, and
the rapidly-growing nonbank sector needs to be better supervised. The authorities clearly recognized the country’s
vulnerability to a range of exogenous shocks and agreed that a contingency plan should be prepared to allow a rapid
response in the event of an adverse shock.

I. CONTEXT
1.
St. Kitts and Nevis is a small, open, middle-income country that is highly
vulnerable to shocks. The closure in 2005 of the sugar industry—the historical mainstay of
the economy—set the stage for a new economic course. The key challenges now facing the
economy include:
•

Transition out of sugar. The country is grappling with the challenge of putting labor
and land released from the sugar sector to more productive uses. In consultation with
the European Union (EU), the government adopted a National Adaptation Strategy in
2006 that aims to put the economy on a sustainable growth path.

•

Debt burden. Public debt1—the result of a series of exogenous shocks and
accommodative policies—amounted to about 185 percent of GDP by end-2006. In the
2006 budget, the authorities announced the goal of boosting the primary surplus to
8 percent of GDP by 2010 to place public debt on a solid downward trajectory.

•

Vulnerability. The economy is vulnerable to external shocks, particularly natural
disasters and shifts in tourism demand. High public debt leaves little room for
maneuver.

2.
Inter-island relations have improved, but the political atmosphere makes fiscal
consolidation and reform challenging. The new Nevis Island Administration (NIA) has
taken a conciliatory approach toward working with the St. Kitts’ Government. In a departure
from past practice, the two islands have held joint Cabinet meetings, including a joint
concluding meeting with the mission. There is speculation in St. Kitts that early elections
might be called in 2008. The NIA also faces pressure to deliver on campaign promises such
as social programs and road construction.
3.
Social indicators remain
favorable. The country has the secondhighest per capita income in the Eastern
Caribbean Currency Union (ECCU) and
ranks third among Caribbean nations in the
UN’s Human Development Index.
However, the spread of HIV/AIDS and
diabetes is becoming a concern.

II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
4.

The economic rebound continued in 2006, but showed signs of slowing in 2007.
•

Growth. The economy grew by 4 percent in 2006, driven by tourism, construction,
and communications. Growth is projected at 3.3 percent in 2007, with tourism
receipts marginally lower, notwithstanding the Cricket World Cup.
St. Kitts and Nevis: Contribution to Overall Inflation

•

(In percent)

Inflation. Average inflation reached
8.5 percent during 2006, the highest in
the ECCU. This reflected large
adjustments in fuel prices and a new fuel
surcharge for electricity, which led to
higher prices for other items, particularly
transportation and food. Inflation has
since decelerated to under 5 percent.

•

Balance of payments. Reflecting strong
construction-related imports, the current
account deficit increased to 29 percent of
GDP in 2006. This was largely financed
by tourism-related FDI (40 percent of
GDP, twice the level in 2005). The
current account deficit is projected to
widen slightly to 31 percent of GDP in
2007, but will continue to be largely
financed by FDI.

some strengthening of the banking system, its
high public sector exposure has increased further (Figure 1). Profitability and loan-loss
provisioning of locally-incorporated banks have increased. The nonperforming loans (NPLs)
ratio declined to just above the ECCB’s prudential target of 5 percent of total assets,2 in part
reflecting the rebound in credit to the private sector on the back of buoyant economic
activity. However, the banking system’s public sector exposure continued to increase. As of
June 2007, banks held 44 percent of total public debt (an increase of 10 percentage points

The 2004 ECCU FSSA, however, noted that there were some problems with loan classification by locallyincorporated banks in the ECCU, particularly with regard to public sector debt.

The picture for the broader public sector is less clear. There is little financial
information on public enterprises—whose share in public debt reached 38 percent by endJune 2007—hindering an accurate assessment of the public sector fiscal stance and debt
sustainability.
9.
Public debt remains a major source of risk (Figure 3). Although debt declined by
about 10 percent of GDP during 2006, rising debt service costs—reflecting increasing rates
for new borrowing—crowded out social spending. Facing tightened external borrowing
conditions, the government has not accessed new commercial external borrowing since 2005,
relying instead mainly on the expensive overdraft facility, which has tripled in two years to
about 22 percent of GDP by end-June 2007.

The government plans to refinance its more costly debt. In October 2006, the
CDB approved a policy-based guarantee, renewable annually, covering one year of debt
service on a proposed 12-year bond of EC$150 million. Proceeds from the bond, when fully
subscribed, would be used to repay more costly debt. In February 2007, the CDB approved a
policy-based loan (PBL) of US$20 million. The first tranche is pending implementation of
several policy measures (Table 9).
11.
Economic prospects look promising, with a number of high-end foreign
investment tourism projects in the pipeline. If the authorities push ahead with their reform
agenda, real growth is projected at around 4 percent over the medium term. However, the
potential slowdown of the global economy, particularly in the United States, and exogenous
shocks such as hurricanes pose downside risks to the outlook.
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
Discussions centered on restoring fiscal and debt sustainability, enhancing competitiveness
and growth, and containing risks.3 The authorities generally agreed with the staff’s analysis
and recommendations, and reaffirmed their commitment to reducing public debt in an
effective and orderly manner.

the domestic banking system already heavily exposed, financing the deficit would require
land/asset sales, contrary to the government’s strategy to use divestment proceeds to pay
down debt. Besides strengthening central government finances, improving debt dynamics
will require better oversight of public enterprises, more land/asset sales, and improved debt
management capacity, areas where progress has been limited.

The mission recommended a set of measures to restore sustainability and
forestall financing problems. Under an “active scenario” with additional fiscal measures,

Containing expenditures and enhancing efficiency will be crucial. The authorities
plan to introduce performance budgeting in 2008 to allow for greater accountability in the
use of budget resources.
•

Off-budget expenditures. “Below-the-line” accounts, many of which capture revenue
and expenditure items not in the budget, have proliferated in recent years. With
CARTAC’s assistance, the authorities have incorporated these accounts into 2006 and
2007 fiscal estimates. The mission commended the

comprehensive civil service reform aimed at eliminating duplication between agencies
and rationalizing the public sector workforce, while ensuring that compensation is
sufficient to retain highly-qualified civil servants.
•

Goods and services. Tighter control over spending on goods and services is crucial.
The mission supported plans to corporatize the electricity department, which has been
a substantial drain on the budget, and suggested a similar approach for water services.

•

Capital expenditure and net lending. Capital spending needs to be prioritized, based
on rigorous cost-benefit analysis and financing availability. The authorities agreed on
the need to strengthen the PSIP process. The NIA indicated that increased capital
spending was needed to attract FDI and transform the economy toward high-end
tourism. Restraining net lending activities would also be important.4

•

Civil servant pension reform. Commendable progress has been made in establishing
a contributory pension scheme for civil servants. The mission welcomed the
authorities’ plan to cap double pensions for civil servants and increase their
retirement age to match that under the social security scheme.

16.
The mission supported the authorities’ consideration of a transactions-based or
value-added tax (VAT), but only with a unified administration. A VAT would replace the
current consumption tax and allow for some increase in revenues to offset the
implementation of the Common External Tariff (CET) under CARICOM.5
•

Tax/customs administration needs to be revamped to ensure successful introduction
of a VAT. Currently, there are two separate administrations—one for each island—
which do not share revenues. Successful VAT implementation will require a unified
regime administered at the federal level and effective revenue-sharing. Following a
recent FAD/CARTAC mission, both islands agreed to establish a joint management
committee to oversee tax/customs administration. While the St. Kitts Government
believed revenue sharing would be feasible, the NIA, which has viewed revenue
autonomy as crucial to its economic development strategy, reserved a firm decision
pending more details on a proposed revenue-sharing mechanism.

•

Thorough preparation, including developing an action plan for tax administration
reform, is essential for the VAT’s success. Such a plan would include creation of a
project team and steering committee and preparation of a detailed roadmap for VAT

4

Net lending in St. Kitts has been mainly on-lending of foreign official credit to statutory bodies, as creditors
preferred to channel funds through the central government (¶18).

The authorities intend to implement Phase IV of the CET gradually over three years, given concerns about
potential revenue losses.

12
implementation, including TA needs. The authorities intend to assemble a strong VAT
team soon and to keep the public fully informed to address uncertainty and
misperceptions.
17.

Other reforms to enhance the tax system’s equity and efficiency were discussed.
•

Social services levy. Adopting a comprehensive personal income tax (PIT) could
broaden the tax base and enhance progressivity. However, given limited
implementation capacity and the need to focus on introducing a VAT, it was agreed
that reforming the existing social services levy, including broadening the definition of
income, could be preferable to introducing a new PIT at this stage.

•

Property tax. The government has made substantial progress in moving toward a
market-based valuation system, with assessments expected to be completed by end2007 and implementation to start in 2008.

•

Tax concessions. St. Kitts and Nevis has granted costly investment incentives,
including generous tax holidays. While the authorities believe that a unilateral
elimination of incentives could place St. Kitts and Nevis at a disadvantage relative to
other countries in the region, a new Investment Code under preparation will specify a
transparent, nondiscretionary regime that provides investment incentives based on
projected economic impact. The government was considering import duty
concessions on some foods and other basic necessities to mitigate the impact of rising
prices. The mission advised against this approach as it could lead to sizable revenue
losses. Instead, targeted transfers could better compensate low-income households.

•

Corporate income tax. The existing Income Tax Act was enacted some 40 years ago
and has many loopholes. The mission endorsed the plan to introduce a new Corporate
Tax Act, which should also limit the room to grant tax concessions.

18.
Control over the broader public sector needs to be strengthened. The adoption of
a new Finance Administration Act (FAA) is a welcome step. Its strict enforcement will be
key, particularly on borrowing and data provision by public enterprises. The mission advised
that borrowing by public enterprises using land as collateral should be strictly avoided, and
government guarantees should be contingent on full and timely disclosure of financial
information.
19.
Debt management capacity, albeit improved, needs further strengthening. With
assistance from CARTAC, the debt unit has compiled a comprehensive government debt
database. The mission recommended incorporation of nongovernment-guaranteed external
debt in the database and closer monitoring of public debt developments. The government
intends to hire a debt management consultant and seek Fund technical assistance to further
strengthen the debt unit, improve debt management capacity of statutory bodies, and
formulate a strategy to retire more costly debt.

13
B. Enhancing Competitiveness and Growth
20.
Discussions centered on structural reforms to enhance the business climate and
improve labor market flexibility, and on releasing government land/assets for more
productive uses. The authorities reaffirmed their commitment to advancing these reforms
and providing a conducive environment for private sector-led growth.
21.
While the real effective exchange rate (REER) does not appear to be misaligned,
external competitiveness remains a challenge (Box 1 and Figure 4). Staff analysis suggests
that the REER is broadly in line with macroeconomic fundamentals. However, maintaining
competitiveness remains challenging, as

inflation during 2007 and the continued
depreciation of the U.S. dollar has since arrested the upward movement of the REER.7
22.
Improving the business climate is essential to support competitiveness. Reflecting
steps to lower the cost of doing business, St. Kitts and Nevis now ranks 64th out of 178
countries on the World Bank’s 2008 Doing Business Indicators survey (Figure 5). While this
ranking is an improvement over last year’s, the country still has the lowest rank in the ECCU
on some sub-categories, such as procedures to start and close a business. The government has
set up a team to address these areas and is establishing a one-stop Investment Promotion
Agency.
23.
Transfer of government land/assets to the private sector for more productive
uses will be key to enhancing growth potential. The mission welcomed the recent sales of
the government’s shares in Cable and Wireless. The adoption of a National Physical
Development Plan is also a welcome step and should be complemented by accelerated
implementation of the government’s plans to unify land development agencies, define a full6

fledged and transparent land development strategy, and create a professionally-staffed land
sales agency. The authorities agreed, but face strong resistance to selling off the nation’s
“patrimony.” To garner public support, the authorities intend to give priority to nationals and
have announced an initiative to sell 618 acres to first-time land owners.
Box 1. External Competitiveness 1
The widening of the current account deficit in the past few years was largely due to the
closure of the sugar industry and external factors, rather than an erosion of competitiveness.
The cessation of sugar exports, rising imports related to a construction boom, and a sharp increase
in oil prices led to a deterioration in the current account.

2/ In computing the norms, medium-term values of the fiscal balance, oil-balance, output

the prediction.

The current account deficit is broadly in line with equilibrium levels predicted by
fundamentals. Using the macroeconomic balance approach, staff estimates put the equilibrium
current account deficit under the baseline scenario (i.e., the current account “norm”) at around
28 percent of GDP. The projected medium-term deficit of about 27 percent of GDP is within one
standard deviation of the equilibrium level. This implies that despite their apparent high levels,
medium-term deficits, financed largely by FDI, appear sustainable. 2
The real effective exchange rate is also broadly in line with fundamentals. The CPI-based
REER appreciated by 2½ percent during 2006, mainly on account of a rise in inflation following
energy price adjustments. While the results from the equilibrium value approach indicate that the
REER was slightly above its equilibrium as of end-2006, the more recent deceleration of inflation
and the continued depreciation of the U.S. dollar have begun to reverse the earlier appreciation
(see Figure 4), suggesting no consistent evidence of misalignment at present.

approach, but using staff’s own estimation from a different sample). See Pineda and Cashin (2007),
“Assessing Exchange Rate Competitiveness in the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union,” forthcoming ECCU
Selected Issues Paper.

While current account deficits of this magnitude could not be sustained indefinitely, the pipeline of foreign
investment projects suggests that FDI levels should remain very high during the period under consideration.

24.
While the labor market is relatively flexible, labor constraints are emerging as
large-scale investment projects come on stream. The mission supported the authorities’
efforts to address emerging labor/skill shortages, including by strengthening vocational and
technical education, and encouraged them to promote greater regional labor mobility.
C. Containing Risks
25.
Reducing public debt to sustainable levels represents a major challenge. Even
with strong growth, full implementation of the reform agenda, and the absence of exogenous
shocks, public debt will remain very high throughout the medium term (Annex I and
Figures 6 and 7). It is, therefore, important to carefully monitor risks, explore options to
lower debt more quickly, and develop a contingency plan.
26.
Banking sector risks need to be carefully monitored. The system’s government
exposure is rising and very high by international standards. While the government has a
strong payment record, any disruption to the government’s payment capacity—owing, for
example, to a shock like a hurricane—could undermine the stability of the banking system.
The high exposure warrants close monitoring, including enhanced supervision of vulnerable
banks, development of a contingency plan, and a strategy to unwind this large exposure.
Moreover, while the pickup of private sector credit growth is a welcome sign of economic
growth, there is a risk that an economic slowdown could lead to a sharp increase in the NPLs.
Lastly, the high and rising level of dollarization, likely reflecting the suspension of exchange
controls in 2004, highlights the need for careful management of currency mismatches. The
authorities noted that the banks report regularly to the ECCB, which is carefully monitoring
banking sector risks including with enhanced off-site inspections. They also reaffirmed their
plans to use the proceeds from land sales and the proposed 12-year bond to pay down the
bank-held sugar debt and the overdraft.
27.
The nonbank sector has been growing rapidly, requiring careful monitoring. The
mission expressed concern about the deposit-taking activities of insurance companies, which
offer fixed-term deposits with interest rates significantly higher than commercial banks.8
These deposit accounts not only undermine the client base for the commercial banks, but the
much higher interest rates could indicate riskier investment activities (of which depositors
may not be fully aware). The staff encouraged the authorities to determine, in coordination
with the ECCB, whether these companies should be required to obtain banking licenses to
continue these activities. The timely establishment of a single regulatory unit, along with the
adoption of supporting legislation such as the Insurance Act, is also critical for containing
emerging risks in the nonbank sector. On AML/CFT, the authorities are preparing for an
assessment in 2008 by the Caribbean Financial Action Task Force; they are strengthening the
Financial Services Department, are planning to undertake an inspection of credit unions with
CARTAC assistance, and have signed Memoranda of Understanding with several countries
for the exchange of information.
8

Indeed, banks’ real deposit rates were negative during 2005–06.

18
28.
St. Kitts and Nevis is vulnerable to a wide range of exogenous shocks, which
could derail the authorities’ adjustment strategy. While financial markets in the region
have remained relatively insulated, recent financial market turmoil, if it continues, could
have a negative impact on the local real estate market, undermining the government’s land
sales strategy and plans for upscale tourism development, while weakening bank portfolios.
The ongoing repricing of risk could also complicate rolling over public sector external debt,
with about EC$110 million (7 percent of GDP) falling due in 2008.9 Other shocks include
natural disasters, declines in tourism demand, a slowdown in the world economy, and higher
world oil prices. The mission welcomed the authorities’ emphasis on preparedness and more
widespread use of insurance for mitigating and managing natural disasters.
29.
The high debt level and vulnerability of the economy point to the need to explore
options to reduce debt more quickly.
•

Land/asset sales. There was broad agreement that the pace of debt reduction would
depend critically on the pace and scope of land/asset sales (Box 2).

•

Concessional resources. The authorities have made important progress toward
meeting the conditions of the CDB’s PBL, which could also facilitate access to the
EU’s pledged sugar grants (2–3 percent of GDP per annum during 2007–13). The
mission encouraged the authorities to use concessional financing under PetroCaribe,
when available, to improve the debt profile.10

30.
Reforming the social security system is necessary to ensure the long-term
viability of public finances. The system’s operating surpluses of 5–6 percent of GDP a year,
which have directly and indirectly financed the budget, will not continue as the population
ages. On current trends, deficits would emerge around 2020 and assets be depleted by midcentury. The authorities have established a committee to explore parametric reforms. The
mission also encouraged the authorities to explore options to gradually diversify portfolio
allocations,11 along with a reduction in government financing needs.
31.
A contingency plan is needed in light of the country’s high vulnerability to
shocks. The mission suggested that a key component of such a plan should be emergency
fiscal measures that can be quickly implemented in the event of shocks. The authorities noted
their intention to identify such a set of measures.

Box 2. St. Kitts: Land Development and Sales
About 80 percent of the island’s land is owned by the St. Kitts Government. The existing land
ownership pattern is a direct result of the compulsory acquisition of sugar estates in 1975 by the
government. Until the demise of the sugar industry, land use policy was primarily designed to
support the sugar sector. Since the sugar industry’s closure in 2005, the sugar lands have largely
been idle.

Two corporations, Frigate Bay and Whitegate, were established to develop and sell lands in
the southeastern and northwestern parts, respectively, of the island. The southeast is currently
the heart of the tourism industry, with high-end projects including the Marriott Resort—the largest
hotel in the country—and ongoing construction of other resorts. In the northwest, a wide range of
projects are either underway or being planned, including golf courses, a horse racing track, and
upscale villas.
In August 2007, the government announced its intention to sell 618 acres of land (about
2 percent of government-owned land) to first-time homeowners under the Special Land
Distribution Initiative (SLDI). Land will be sold using a two-tier pricing system—EC$4.95 per
sq.ft. for the first 4,000 square feet and EC$6.50 thereafter.
Preliminary estimates suggest that proceeds from land sales, based on a conservative
assumption on market prices, could be on the order of 45–50 percent of 2006 GDP. About
10-13 percent of GDP could be generated by the SLDI. Selling another 1,200 acres of land, in line
with the CDB policy-based-loan conditions and using a lower bound for market prices, could yield
additional proceeds of about 36 percent of GDP.

IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
32.
Macroeconomic outcomes have strengthened in recent years. Growth has
rebounded, and fiscal balances have improved markedly. This is testament to the authorities’
commitment to reinvigorate the economy and restore sustainability, including by closing the
sugar industry and launching a reform strategy to boost growth and reduce debt.
33.
The economy, however, remains very vulnerable. Public debt is very high,
constraining the room for maneuver in the event of shocks. Recent fiscal trends have
increased the risk that earlier consolidation gains could be reversed and public debt return to
an upward path. With access to external credit markets limited, the domestic banking system
already heavily exposed to the government, and a less benign global environment, strong
efforts are needed to mitigate risks and place public debt on a solid downward trajectory.
34.
The authorities’ medium-term fiscal goals are appropriate but need to be
underpinned by:
•

Expenditure restraint. It is critical to move quickly with the corporatization of the
electricity department; contain and prioritize capital expenditures; refrain from net
lending; implement comprehensive civil service reform; and reform civil servant
pensions.

•

Tax reforms, focused on broadening the tax base and revamping tax administration
(in particular, a unified VAT regime).

35.
Improving the oversight of public enterprises will also be key. The recent
adoption of the new FAA is a major step in the right direction, but its strict enforcement will
be crucial for its success. Ongoing efforts to strengthen debt management capacity are well
placed.
36.
Although the real effective exchange rate and medium-term current account
deficits are broadly in line with fundamentals, maintaining external competitiveness
remains challenging. Other indicators—including inflation, tourism developments,
deteriorating terms of trade, and high wages—point to challenges for competitiveness. Fiscal
consolidation is not only fundamental to supporting competitiveness, but also necessary to
avoid instability and underpin the quasi-currency board arrangement.
37.
Planned structural reforms will enhance competitiveness and growth. The
authorities have initiated a number of reforms, but the pace of implementation could be
accelerated to build on the current growth momentum. Priority should be given to
strengthening the business climate and labor market flexibility.
38.
Transfers of government land/assets to the private sector should help promote
growth and reduce public debt. The adoption of a National Physical Development Plan, the

21
recent sale of the government’s shares in Cable and Wireless, and the government’s
commitment to use divestment proceeds to lower debt are positive developments. The staff
also welcomes the government’s plans to consolidate land development agencies, define a
land development strategy, and establish a land sales agency.
39.
Financial sector risks warrant careful monitoring. The high government exposure
of the banking system is a systemic concern. Implementing measures to mitigate risks should
be given a top priority, including enhanced supervision of vulnerable banks and reducing the
large government exposure. Establishing a single regulatory unit is also essential for more
comprehensive supervision of the nonbank sector.
40.
Risk management and contingency planning should be a priority. Even with
determined efforts and a benign external environment, public debt will remain high well into
the next decade. Given the country’s vulnerability to shocks, a full-fledged contingency plan,
including a set of emergency fiscal measures, should be at hand. The authorities should also
continue their efforts to tap more concessional resources, particularly the EU sugar grants, to
lower the debt level more quickly.
41.
Better statistics will support effective economic management. Commendable
progress has been made in improving the quality and coverage of central government fiscal
data, which will strengthen fiscal policy analysis and implementation. Further improvements
are needed in the areas of national accounts, labor markets, tourism, debt, and public
enterprises.
42.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be conducted on the standard
12-month cycle.

ANNEX I. MEDIUM-TERM FISCAL SCENARIOS AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Two scenarios, baseline and active, are considered. Under the baseline, major reforms are
delayed and expenditures continue to increase, resulting in large financing gaps and a rise in
the public debt ratio. In contrast, the active scenario, under which the authorities deepen and
sustain fiscal adjustment and structural reforms, suggests a solid downward trajectory for
public debt over the medium term.
•

Baseline scenario. Real growth in 2008 is projected to be slightly stronger than in
2007, as the tourism sector recovers somewhat owing to improved airlift from the
United States. However, growth will gradually decline to 2 percent in the medium
term, reflecting delayed structural reforms, including land/asset sales. On revenue, a
market-based property tax and VAT will be introduced in 2008 and mid-2010,
respectively. Tax concessions continue to be granted. On expenditure, the electricity
department will be corporatized only in mid-2009, the wage bill as a share of GDP
will start to increase

their debt is projected to
decline from 72 percent of GDP at end-2006 to 63 percent by 2012, reflecting the
assumption that the Finance Administration Act is passed but its enforcement and
control are lax. Total public debt is projected to increase to almost 200 percent of
GDP by 2012.

•

Active scenario. With accelerated structural reforms, including land/asset sales of
3 percent of GDP per year, and a shift toward more productive private investment,
real growth remains at 4 percent per year throughout the medium term, compared to
declining growth under the baseline scenario. On revenue, a market-based property
tax and VAT will be introduced in 2008 and early 2010, respectively. Tax
concessions are contained and efforts to collect tax arrears are strengthened. On
expenditure, the electricity department will be corporatized in mid-2008, the wage

23
bill will grow in line with inflation, there is no net lending, and capital expenditures
will be reduced, largely reflecting a postponement of planned new road construction
in Nevis. Under this scenario, the central government primary balance will reach
8 percent of GDP by 2010. Strict enforcement of the Finance Administration Act
combined with stronger control of borrowing by public enterprises will lead to the
projected decline of public enterprise indebtedness, from 72 percent of GDP at end2006 to 53 percent by 2012. The overall public debt is projected to decline steadily to
126 percent of GDP by 2012.
The active scenario is modified as follows:
•

Disaster in 2008 and 2012. Reflecting the vulnerability to hurricanes, this assumes
that real growth is reduced by 5 percent in 2008 and 2012, respectively, and
expenditure is increased by 2–3 percent of annual GDP during 2008–12.

•

Lower growth. This has the same fiscal path as the active scenario but GDP growth
declines as in the baseline scenario.

•

Higher interest rates. The interest rate increases gradually by 5 percentage points
relative to the base case, in which the marginal interest rate increases broadly in line
with the WEO projections for the U.S. deposit rate.

•

With EU financing. Reflecting EU commitments on sugar assistance, this assumes
an increase in grants of 2–3 percent of annual GDP during 2008–12.

ANNEX II. SUMMARY OF APPENDICES
The full appendices to this report are issued as a supplement.
Fund relations. St. Kitts and Nevis has no outstanding Fund resources. It is a member of the
Eastern Caribbean Currency Union (ECCU), which has a common central bank, the Eastern
Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB). The common currency, the EC dollar, has been pegged to
the U.S. dollar at the rate of EC$2.70 since July 1976. St. Kitts and Nevis has accepted the
obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Articles of Agreement. The exchange
system is free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current
international transactions.
Relations with the World Bank Group. The country assistance strategy (CAS) for
FY 2006−09 supports the region’s development through: (1) stimulating growth and
improving competitiveness; and (2) reducing vulnerability. The current CAS does not include
any lending to St. Kitts and Nevis under the base case scenario. There are three active
projects in St. Kitts and Nevis with a commitment of US$9.6 million of which
US$3.7 million has been disbursed: (i) Telecommunications and ICT Development Project,
approved on May 12, 2005, to improve the access, quality, and use of telecommunications
and ICT services; (ii) Education Development Project approved in June 2003, to increase
equitable access to secondary education and improve the quality of the teaching and learning
processes; and (iii) HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Program, approved in January 2003.
Relations with the Caribbean Development Bank. The CDB has approved loans of
US$165.8 million, of which US$119.1 million has been disbursed as of end-September 2007. Major

projects under implementation include: a basic education project; road projects, a child
development project, loans to Nevis Electricity Company (NEVLEC), a natural disaster
management project, a policy-based guarantee, and a policy-based loan.
Statistical issues. St. Kitts and Nevis has participated in the General Data Dissemination
System since October 2000 and its metadata are posted on the Fund’s Dissemination
Standards Bulletin Board. There are significant weaknesses in real, fiscal, and balance of
payments data. Data on GDP by type of expenditure are not available at constant prices,
while the data at current prices are not reliable due to weaknesses in estimating gross capital
formation. A new CPI with weights from the 2000 household survey has been introduced.
There are no data on labor market developments. Fiscal data are not reported for publication
in IFS. The latest data published in the GFS Yearbook are for 2003 (only). No data are
available on the nonfinancial public sector. Data on external trade (especially exports) are not
comprehensive, as they omit important categories of goods. Most components of the
financial account also need improvement. There are no data on private external debt.

1/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.
2/ Gross debt of central government and public enterprises.
3/ Derived as [(r - p(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; p = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; a = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
4/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 3/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
5/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 3/ as ae(1+r).
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
8/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
9/ Real depreciation is defined as nominal depreciation (measured by percentage fall in dollar value of local currency) minus domestic inflation (based on GDP deflator).

B1. Real interest rate is at baseline plus one standard deviations
B2. Real GDP growth is at baseline minus one-half standard deviation
B3. Primary balance is at baseline minus one-half standard deviation
B4. Combination of B1-B3 using one-quarter standard deviation shocks
B5. One time 30 percent real depreciation in 2008 9/
B6. 10 percent of GDP increase in other debt-creating flows in 2008

N/A

St. Kitts and Nevis is a member of the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB), which
manages monetary policy and the exchange system for its eight members. The common
currency, the Eastern Caribbean dollar, has been pegged to the U.S. dollar at the rate of
EC$2.70 per U.S. dollar since July 1976. In practice the ECCB has operated like a quasicurrency board, maintaining foreign exchange backing of its currency and demand liabilities
of close to 100 percent. St. Kitts and Nevis accepted the obligations of Article VIII,
Sections 2, 3, and 4 in December 1984. The exchange system is free of restrictions on the
making of payments and transfers for current international transactions.
X.

Safeguards Assessment:

Under the Fund's safeguards assessment policy, the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB),
of which St. Kitts and Nevis is a participating government, is subject to a full safeguards

40
assessment under a four-year cycle. The most recent assessment was completed in July 2007
and concluded that the ECCB continues to have appropriate control mechanisms in place,
which have strengthened since the first safeguards assessment was completed in 2003. ECCB
management places emphasis on good governance and sound controls, and has enhanced the
bank’s transparency and accountability since the last assessment, including the publications
of financial statements that comply with International Financial Reporting Standards. The
assessment made some recommendations to sustain the ECCB’s safeguards framework going
forward.
XI.

Last Article IV Consultation:

St. Kitts and Nevis is on the standard 12-month consultation cycle. The last Article IV
consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on January 17, 2007. The staff report is
IMF Country Report No. 07/141, and the accompanying statistical appendix is IMF
Country Report No. 07/142.
XII.

FSAP Participation, ROSCs, and OFC Assessment

St. Kitts and Nevis participated in the regional ECCU FSAP conducted in September and
October 2003. The Financial System Stability Assessment is available at
www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2004/cr04293.pdf. A review of St. Kitts and Nevis
AML/CFT Assessment was conducted by a team of assessors representing the Caribbean
Financial Action Taskforce (CFATF) in September 2003.
XIII. Technical Assistance: (2005–Present)
Since 2005, St. Kitts and Nevis has benefited from technical assistance in the areas of tax
policy, tax administration, economic statistics, financial supervision and macroeconomic
management, both from IMF headquarters and the Caribbean Regional Technical Assistance
Centre (CARTAC).
•

Experts from CARTAC and the IMF’s Statistics Department (STA) advised the
Central Statistics Office on improving the national accounts, and developing exportimport price indices.

•

Experts from CARTAC, the IMF’s Monetary and Capital Markets Department
(MCM), and the IMF’s Legal Department (LEG) advised the authorities on
strengthening financial regulation and supervision, including risk-based supervision.
With assistance from the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions in
Canada (OSFI), experts from CARTAC have provided technical assistance to the
ECCB on drafting the OECS Insurance Act. They have also, in conjunction with

41
LEG, provided technical assistance to the ECCB in finalizing the drafting of the
OECS Money Services business Act.
•

Experts from CARTAC and MCM also provided technical assistance on public debt
management framework.

•

Experts from CARTAC, the IMF’s Fiscal Affairs Department (FAD) and LEG
provided assistance to improve cash management and tax administration—including
collection enforcement. Experts from CARTAC have also provided assistance in
Property Tax reform, in preparing to move the property tax base from rental value to
market value, and in improving central government fiscal and debt data.

•

CARTAC and FAD have provided extensive assistance, through frequent expert
visits, to sensitize politicians and technicians from the Ministry of Finance on the
value-added tax (VAT). This provided a general explanation on VAT, a VAT
sensitivity study, and the main steps in its introduction.

•

Experts from LEG provided assistance in tax legislation in the areas of VAT, Social
Service Levy and Corporate Income Tax.

•

As part of the Stabilization and Adjustment Technical Assistance Program
(SATAP), St. Kitts and Nevis have benefited from capacity building in
macroeconomic analysis.

42
Appendix II. St. Kitts and Nevis: Relations with the World Bank Group
(As of November 16, 2007)
The World Bank’s Management presented to its Board the Eastern Caribbean Sub-Region
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), on September 13, 2005. The World Bank Group’s
strategy for the four years covered by this CAS (FY 2006–09) supports the sub-region’s
development agenda through two main pillars: (1) stimulating growth and improving
competitiveness; and (2) reducing vulnerability, by promoting greater social inclusion and
strengthening disaster risk management. Recognizing the Organization of the Eastern
Caribbean States (OECS) countries’ weakened creditworthiness due to high debt ratios, Bank
activities will focus on leveraging available donor grant financing. Following the
recommendations of the 2005 growth and competitiveness study for the OECS, IBRD and
IDA support would focus on providing technical and financial assistance for interventions to
support the two main pillars. The CAS proposes new commitments of US$103.4 million for
six borrowing member states of the OECS, including St. Kitts and Nevis. Planned IBRD
lending to St. Kitts and Nevis amounts to US$10 million under the high-case lending
scenario.
A. Projects
There are three active World Bank projects in St. Kitts and Nevis for commitment of
approximately US$9.6 million of which US$4.3 million has been disbursed.
The St. Kitts and Nevis Telecommunications and ICT Development Project, approved on
May 12, 2005 for US$0.54 million, aims at improving the access, quality, and use of
telecommunications and ICT services to achieve socioeconomic development in the OECS.
The project has the following four components: Component 1) will strengthen the national
and regional regulatory frameworks and promote additional competition in the
telecommunications sector. Emphasis will be given to capacity building of Eastern Caribbean
Telecommunications Authority (ECTEL) and the National Telecommunications Regulatory
Commissions (NTRCs) by providing them with assistance to revise the regional and national
sector legislation, and develop a modem interconnection regime. Component 2) will review
current universal access policy, create related guidelines, and provide financial support to
establish a Universal Service Fund (USF). Component 3) will improve growth and
competitiveness in ICT-enabled services through utilization of broadband infrastructure.
Component 4) will ensure management and administration of the overall project.
The St. Kitts and Nevis Education Development Project was approved in June 2003 for
US$5.0 million. The overall objective of this project is to build human capital which, in turn,
will contribute to the diversification of the economy and more sustainable growth. This
objective will be achieved by: (i) increasing equitable access to secondary education;
(ii) improving the quality of the teaching and learning process, with more direct interventions
at the school level and a focus on student-centered learning, and (iii) strengthening
management of the sector and governance of schools.

43

The HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Program, which was approved in January 2003
for US$4.0 million, is funded under the Multi-Country APL for the Caribbean Region, with
the following objectives: (i) curbing the spread of HIV/AIDS epidemic; (ii) reducing the
morbidity and mortality attributed to HIV/AIDS; (iii) improving the quality of life for
persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWAs); and (iv) developing a sustainable organizational
and institutional framework for managing the HIV/AIDS epidemic over the longer term.
B. Economic and Sector Work
Economic and Sector Work: The Bank has, over the past three years, completed a series of
analytical work relating to public expenditure, fiscal and debt sustainability, growth and
competitiveness, the financial sector, public sector management and social protection. The
ongoing dissemination of these reports represents a key instrument for policy dialogue with
the OECS governments including St. Kitts and Nevis.
In addition, the OECS countries will benefit from ongoing and planned regional studies
including: A Caribbean regional study (recently completed) on crime and violence focuses on
the impact of crime on poverty, social cohesion, tourism, investment and migration; a
planned pension reform study will take an in-depth look at social insurance programs in the
Caribbean, focusing in particular on reforms to address the challenges of limited coverage,
increasing dependency ratios and fiscal sustainability; a study on Air Transport
Rationalization (recently completed) which inter alia, analyzes regional air transport route
and classify their commercial viability, evaluate the current air service arrangements,
examine the feasibility of entering into “open skies” arrangements, and assess the impact of
direct and indirect taxation on competition and service; and a study on access to finance
(recently completed) which examined the issues related to access to finance, particularly for
small and medium enterprises in the OECS. The Bank is also finalizing a Policy Note on
Project Fiduciary Management which is aimed at increasing the efficiency of project
implementation in the OECS.

Appendix III: St. Kitts and Nevis—Relations with the
Caribbean Development Bank
(As of September 30, 2007)
The Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) has approved loans totalling US$165.8 million, of which
US$46.7 million are undisbursed.
A. Major Projects
1.

Basic Education Project—to assist GOSKN in the provision and maintenance of a more
appropriate learning environment for a greater number of students in the system (including
those with learning disabilities) who are pursuing basic education at primary and secondary
schools; and enhancement of the education system in the areas of management, in particular,
planning, data collection and analysis, student assessment, school management, curriculum
development and pedagogy.

2.

West Basseterre By-Pass Road—to construct approximately 3.8 kilometres of road to relieve
traffic congestion in the city of Basseterre. The proposed road runs to the north of Basseterre
and along the boundary fence of the Robert L. Bradshaw International Airport.

3.

Second Power Project—consists of the installation of a generator of approximate size 2.5MW
and ancillary switchgear and the establishment of an operations facility at the Nevis
Electricity Company Limited (NEVLEC). The project will provide additional generating
capacity to satisfy projected electricity demand and to replace existing engines that are past
their useful life.

4.

Student Loan Scheme (Fifth Loan)—to assist the Development Bank of St Kitts and Nevis
(DBSKN) in financing loans to students attending local, regional and extra-regional
institutions for programmes in technical, vocational and academic studies.

5.

Child Development Project—to provide a comprehensive framework for addressing the care
and protection of children and the reform of juvenile offenders. The project will enhance the
life chances of children in St. Kitts and Nevis by improving their connectedness with the
school system and providing rehabilitative care for those at risk and those who have
committed offences.

6.

Natural Disaster Management Project—to contribute to the rehabilitation of economic
infrastructure caused by hurricane Lenny. The project consists of rehabilitating 8.66 metres of
sea defence structures with rock armouring and stone on geo-textile sheeting; reconstruction
of a reinforced concrete ramp; and repairs to other infrastructure and public buildings. The
project promotes the reduction of vulnerability to natural disasters through support for the
development and adoption of mitigation policies, standards and practices.

7.

Policy-based Guarantee—to support a bond issue of up to EC$150 mn by the Government to
refinance high cost debt thereby supporting ongoing macroeconomic reforms and structural

46
reforms in St. Kitts and Nevis. The refinancing would also improve the debt dynamics, thus
lowering the time-path of the debt-to-GDP ratio.
8.

Policy-based Loan—is intended to support policy and institutional reforms while helping the
Federal Government to improve debt dynamics by using the proceeds of the loan to replace
some of its high-cost debt. The policy reforms are designed to improve public finance
management, particularly budget management and revenue systems, and public enterprises
governance systems to achieve fiscal and debt sustainability.

Appendix IV. St. Kitts and Nevis: Statistical Issues
Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance, however significant shortcomings in data
provision and data quality remain. St. Kitts and Nevis has been participating in the General
Data Dissemination System (GDDS) since October 2000 and its metadata are posted on the
Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB).
A. Real Sector
There are a number of deficiencies in the real sector statistics. GDP data by type of
expenditure are not available at constant prices, while the data at current prices are not
reliable due to weaknesses in estimating gross capital formation. Private final consumption
expenditure is estimated as a residual. A new CPI with weights from the 2000 household
survey has now been introduced. Monthly CPI data are reported regularly but with a long lag.
Detailed data on tourism arrivals and expenditure have not been compiled since end-2001.
No data are currently available on labor market developments. Results of the 2001 population
census are still being analyzed.
B. Public Finances
Data on revenue, expenditure, and financing of the consolidated central government are made
available to Fund staff on request. Commendable progress has recently been made in
improving the quality and coverage of central government fiscal data, including on
government debt. However, discrepancies between overall balance and available financing
need to be resolved. It would be important to produce a set of fully integrated accounts for
the central government on a regular basis. Also, it would be beneficial to institute a
mechanism for the regular reporting of financial data on the rest of the public sector. Data for
the budgetary central government published in IFS relate to 2003 and 2004; the most recent
data on the central government published in the GFS Yearbook are for 2003.
C. Balance of Payments and External Debt
Estimates are currently provided on an annual basis by the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank
(ECCB). The latest data published in IFS are for 2005. Incomplete provisional data have
been produced for 2006 by the ECCB; these will be completed and finalized in early 2008.
Data on external trade (especially exports) are not comprehensive, as they omit important
categories of goods. Most components of the financial account also need improvement. It
would be useful to reconcile the data on the public sector investment plan for external loans
with the public external debt database. There are no data on private external debt.

48
D. Monetary and Financial Statistics
The 2003 money and banking statistics mission indicated that enhanced institutional
coverage, classification of financial instruments, and sectorization of economic units would
facilitate identification of credit flows to different sectors of the economy and compilation of
monetary aggregates. It recommended that the institutional coverage for other depository
corporations be expanded to include credit unions, finance companies, and building societies,
which also accept demand and other deposits. Further, the mission recommended broadening
the coverage to include insurance companies, pension funds, development banks, and
offshore institutions and foundations.
In April 2007, a data ROSC mission assessed the monetary statistics with reference to the
GDDS and the Data Quality Assessment Framework (DQAF, July 2003). It indicated that the
quality of the ECCB and Eastern Caribbean Currency Union member countries’ monetary
statistics has improved over recent years, and the monetary statistics are broadly adequate for
macroeconomic analysis and policy design and monitoring. Nevertheless, the mission
identified shortcomings that have the potential for detracting from accurate and timely
analysis of economic and financial developments. In particular, the institutional coverage of
the other depository corporations remains incomplete, as data for mortgage companies,
finance companies, building societies, and credit unions—all of which accept deposits—are
excluded. Also, accrued interest is not incorporated in the value of the interest-bearing assets
and liabilities, and valuation adjustments are included in other liabilities. In addition, source
data for the commercial banks do not provide the disaggregation recommended in the
Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual. The authorities endorsed the mission’s
recommendations and an action plan for enhancing the analytical usefulness of the monetary
statistics.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
February 4, 2008
Since the issuance of the staff report, the authorities revised slightly the 2006 fiscal data,
granted a salary increase for government employees, and presented the 2008 budgets for
St. Kitts and Nevis. The new information does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
1.
The revised 2006 fiscal estimates indicate a primary surplus of 4.7 percent of
GDP, compared to 4.3 percent in the staff report. The adjustment reflects the removal of
some double-counting of capital expenditures.
2.
A 5 percent interim salary increase for government employees, retroactive from
January 2007, was paid in December 2007.1 The cost is estimated at about EC$8 million
(0.6 percent of GDP). Accordingly, staff has revised the 2007 primary surplus projection to
1.9 percent of GDP, down from 2.4 percent in the staff report.
3.
The 2008 budgets imply an overall primary surplus of about 1 percent of GDP,
compared with a small deficit in the staff’s baseline scenario. As before, the revised staff
estimate is based on historical rates for capital expenditure implementation and grants. Key
components of the budgets include:
•

No new taxes in 2008, while efforts to strengthen tax collection will continue. A
decision on the introduction of a VAT will be made in 2008.

•

Savings arising from the PetroCaribe agreement2 are broadly offset by higher wages and
capital expenditures.

•

As part of comprehensive civil service reform, a salary review is to be completed in
2008, with a further retroactive payment if the final increase is higher than the interim.

•

Capital expenditures reflect ongoing and new road projects, Nevis airport expansion,
projects to improve public utilities, and investments in health and education.

•

To mitigate the impact of rising prices, the government plans to limit retail margins on a
basket of basic consumption items, reduce duties and taxes on some imported foods
(already incorporated in the original baseline scenario), and cap the electricity fuel
surcharge. However, the electricity department is envisaged to be corporatized by late
2008.

1

A general salary increase had been built into the original baseline scenario for 2008, but not for 2007.

2

The first shipment of about 7,000 barrels of diesel fuel was received in December 2007.

Public Information Notice (PIN) No. 08/42
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
April 1, 2008

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2007 Article IV Consultation
with St. Kitts and Nevis
On February 4, 2008, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with St. Kitts and Nevis.1
Background
The closure in 2005 of the sugar industry—the historical mainstay of the economy—set the
stage for a new economic course. Indeed, despite the closure, growth remained strong in
2006, with output increasing by 4 percent, driven by tourism, construction, and
communications. Some slowdown is expected for 2007, with growth projected at 3.3 percent.
Medium-term prospects look promising, with a number of high-end foreign investment tourism
projects in the pipeline.
Large adjustments in retail fuel prices and a new fuel surcharge for electricity created a
temporary inflation spike in 2006, but inflation has since decelerated as these one-off effects
dissipated. Reflecting strong construction-related imports, the current account deficit increased
to around 30 percent of GDP in 2006/07, but has been largely financed by tourism-related
foreign direct investment (FDI).
Considerable progress has been made in strengthening the fiscal accounts. The government
achieved a sizable primary surplus in 2006 for the second year in a row. A buoyant economy,
the electricity surcharge, strengthened tax administration, and wage restraint have contributed
1

Under Article IV of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country’s economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country’s authorities.

2
to this improvement. However, expenditure management remains a challenge. The primary
surplus is projected to decline to 2 percent of GDP in 2007 (from around 4½ percent in 2006),
largely because of a sharp increase in net lending in St. Kitts and a near-tripling of capital
expenditure in Nevis, with major road projects underway.
Despite the fiscal improvement, public debt remains high—at about 185 percent of GDP at
end-2006—leaving little room for maneuver in the event of an adverse shock. Facing tightened
external borrowing conditions, the government has relied mainly on domestic sources to meet
its financing needs. There also continues to be insufficient financial information on public
enterprises, whose share in public debt reached 38 percent by end-June 2007.
Monetary and financial developments have been largely favorable, although the high and
rising public sector exposure of the banking system is a concern. Credit to the private sector
rebounded on the back of buoyant economic activity and, partly reflecting this, the
nonperforming loans ratio declined. However, the banking system’s holdings of public debt had
risen to 44 percent as of end-June 2007. The nonbank sector has been growing rapidly, while
progress in establishing an appropriate supervisory and regulatory framework for this sector
has been limited so far.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities of St. Kitts and Nevis for their efforts to
strengthen macroeconomic performance, with growth rebounding and fiscal balances
improving markedly. Directors observed, however, that the country’s high public debt leaves
little room for maneuver in the event of adverse shocks. Sustained fiscal consolidation, backed
up with the development of a contingency plan to respond to economic shocks, would help
mitigate the risks associated with the high debt stock.
Directors welcomed the important steps that have been taken towards strengthening fiscal
performance, including the improvement of tax administration and the adoption of an automatic
pass-through of fuel prices. They encouraged the authorities to continue their efforts to
achieve their medium-term fiscal goals and put debt on a solid downward trajectory.
Expenditure restraint, including comprehensive civil service reform, will be key. Plans to
broaden the tax base, improve the oversight and transparency of public enterprises and
strengthen debt management capacity will also support these goals. Directors noted that
public debt would remain elevated throughout the medium term, and encouraged the
authorities to explore options for a more rapid debt reduction, including by accelerating the
pace of asset sales, which could also promote private sector-led growth.
Directors noted that the real effective exchange rate does appear broadly in line with
fundamentals. Further fiscal consolidation would support external competitiveness and
underpin the regional currency arrangement. Directors also encouraged the authorities to

3
accelerate the implementation of planned structural reforms aimed at improving the business
climate and strengthening the economy’s flexibility and resilience. Directors noted that the
country’s large external current account deficit, mainly financed by foreign direct investment,
although likely to remain high over the medium term, could be expected to decline as
investment in infrastructure and tourism projects taper off.
Directors noted that financial sector risks need to be carefully monitored. They called for
further progress in mitigating risks, including through enhancing supervision of vulnerable
banks and reducing the large government exposure. They welcomed the authorities’ plan to
establish a single regulatory unit for the nonbank financial sector.
Directors also welcomed the progress made in improving the quality and coverage of fiscal
data, and looked forward to similar progress in other areas.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.
