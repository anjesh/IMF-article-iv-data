IMF Executive Board Concludes 2015 Article IV Consultation with Peru
On May 20, 2015, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Peru.1
Peru remains one of the best performing economies in Latin America, with solid
macroeconomic policies and fundamentals and visible gains in poverty reduction. However,
like most of the region, Peru faced a challenging external environment in 2014. Lower metal
prices and weaker demand from trading partners were a major drag on private investment
and exports. On the domestic front, an unexpected drop in subnational public investment
level and temporary supply disruptions in mining, fishing, and agriculture compounded
external shocks. Against this background, real GDP growth slowed to 2.4 percent in 2014,
from 5.8 percent a year earlier. Headline inflation closed the year slightly above the upper
band of the central bank’s target range due to supply shocks, but expectations remained well
anchored. The high external current account deficit declined slightly despite lower
commodity prices and sluggish external demand.
A strong policy framework and solid fundamentals allowed the authorities to loosen the
macroeconomic policy stance. The authorities embarked on a series of fiscal and structural
packages, including tax cuts, increases in fiscal spending, and structural measures to support
investment, consumption, and growth. Monetary conditions were also eased against a
widening negative output gap and stable inflation expectations, helping to lower lending
rates and providing support to credit to the private sector. New de-dollarization measures
were launched at the end of 2014.
Real GDP is projected to expand at about 3.75 percent this year, contingent on the reversal
of last year’s supply shocks and policy stimulus. Growth is expected to rise in 2016−17,
assuming new mines come on stream, large infrastructure projects are implemented, and
terms of trade shocks fade, with the output gap closing by 2018. Inflation is projected to
converge towards the mid-point of the target range by end-2015, and the current account
deficit will narrow gradually over the medium term as mining exports gain ground.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a
report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

Important risks loom on the horizon, but ample buffers place Peru in a comfortable position
to respond to future shocks.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Director commended the authorities for the country’s solid macroeconomic
policies and fundamentals and visible gains in poverty reduction, which have made Peru one
of the best performing economies in Latin America. While noting that risks to the outlook are
tilted to the downside, Directors considered that Peru is in a comfortable position to respond
to shocks, given the ample buffers in place. They concurred that if negative shocks
materialize, exchange rate flexibility should be the main line of defense, and liquidity could
be provided to avoid an undue contraction in credit, while acknowledging that Peru’s
dollarized economy increases the risks from exchange rate volatility. Looking ahead,
Directors encouraged the authorities to continue to implement ambitious structural reforms to
sustain inclusive growth and diversify the economy, including through further dedollarization.
Directors agreed that the 2015 fiscal stimulus was timely, and concurred that the immediate
priority is executing the existing package with a focus on boosting investment, rather than
developing new measures. Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to gradually
withdraw the stimulus from 2016. They encouraged the authorities to implement careful
expenditure management and revenue mobilization to return to the original fiscal path by
2018. Directors emphasized that hikes in non-priority current spending should be avoided,
given the need to finance structural reforms, carry through the civil service reform, increase
allocations for physical and human capital investment, and protect social programs. They
agreed that, over the medium term, targeting a small structural fiscal surplus would be
advisable to preserve buffers. Continued strong political commitment remains essential to
maintain the credibility of the new fiscal framework.
Directors supported the accommodative monetary policy stance that has kept inflation
expectations well anchored. Looking ahead, they concurred that monetary policy should
remain responsive to inflation expectations and external developments, while limited foreign
exchange rate intervention could be necessary to smooth excessive volatility in a still highly
dollarized economy.
Directors welcomed the new de-dollarization measures. They agreed that strengthening
prudential requirements on dollar lending and encouraging the private sector to hedge its
foreign currency exposure could further support the de-dollarization process, along with
deepening financial and capital markets. Directors supported enhancing data collection and

analysis of corporate and household balance sheets to better assess risks from currency
mismatches.
Directors observed that the financial system remains stable, although the recent deterioration
in the quality of the loan portfolio of non-bank financial institutions warrants close
monitoring and supervision. A more effective use of existing programs to support small and
medium-sized enterprises could help mitigate the impact of the growth slowdown.
Directors underscored the importance of steadfast implementation of structural reforms to
boost potential growth and foster social inclusion. They welcomed the authorities’ priority on
streamlining legal requirements and red tape. Directors concurred on the need to pursue
ambitious education reform and inclusion polices within the framework of fiscal discipline.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
May 5, 2015

KEY ISSUES
Context: Peru remains one of the best performing economies in Latin America, with
solid macroeconomic fundamentals, strong policy frameworks, and visible gains in
poverty reduction. Like most of the region, Peru faced a challenging external
environment in 2014. External shocks were compounded by domestic supply disruptions
and a drop in subnational public investment, and growth decelerated sharply. Headline
inflation was slightly above the upper band of the central bank’s (BCRP) target range due
to supply shocks, but expectations remained well anchored. The external current account
deficit declined slightly despite weaker external conditions.
Outlook and risks: Growth is expected to recover in 2015 and over the medium term,
contingent on production at new mines approaching capacity, priority infrastructure
projects advancing, and shocks to terms of trade fading. However, downside risks
dominate. Externally, these include a surge in global financial volatility, further dollar
appreciation, or lower commodity prices and external demand. Domestic downside risks
include weaker investment, uncertainties surrounding 2016 Presidential elections, and
persistent social conflicts. A faster unwinding of supply shocks or a more complete passthrough of lower food and fuel global prices constitute upside risks.
Near-term policy mix: The policy mix is broadly adequate to support the recovery and
maintain macroeconomic stability. The immediate priority is expediting the execution of
public investment in line with government plans, while avoiding increases in non-priority
current spending. Monetary policy should remain responsive to inflation expectations
and external developments. Exchange rate flexibility should be the main line of defense
against any additional external pressures. The timely use of macro-prudential tools and
ongoing de-dollarization efforts should further solidify financial stability.
Medium-term prospects: With the end of the commodity boom, a push to deepen
structural reforms will be necessary to sustain potential growth and diversify the
economy. Revenue losses would need to be offset to finance structural reforms,
investment, and inclusion along a gradual fiscal consolidation path. Streamlining legal
requirements and red tape is rightly a government reform priority and the ambitious
education reform and inclusion polices should stay their course within the framework of
fiscal discipline. Persevering with labor market reform remains important.

CONTEXT
1.
Peru achieved impressive macroeconomic outcomes over the last decade. During
2003−13, growth averaged 6.2 percent, among the highest in Latin America, and inflation was
2.9 percent, the lowest in the region. Over this period, gross public debt fell by more than half to
20 percent of GDP and net debt dropped to 5 percent of GDP. These exceptional outcomes were
achieved through prudent macroeconomic management of the commodity boom, anchored by a
strong policy framework and a far-reaching structural reform agenda. The economy recovered
quickly from the 2008–09 global financial crisis. Accommodative macroeconomic policies played an
instrumental role and were smoothly unwound as growth accelerated.
2.
Poverty reduction and inclusion strategies have had visible results. Poverty in Peru has
persistently declined throughout the last decade, from 59 percent in 2004 to 23 percent in 2014.
Extreme poverty had an even more striking drop and income distribution improved. These results
stand out in the region, where poverty reduction has stagnated more recently given weaker growth.
The government has expanded the social safety net and embarked on multifaceted education and
financial inclusion reforms to improve living standards and alleviate social tensions, with
redistributive policies estimated to account for about half of poverty reduction since the mid-1990s
(Appendix I).
3.
Like most of the region, Peru faced a challenging external environment in 2014 and
growth slowed markedly. A renewed slide in global metal prices and continued moderation in the
growth of China (Peru’s main trading partner) were a major drag on private investment and exports.
External shocks were compounded by an unexpected drop in sub-national public investment due to
implementation problems and temporary supply disruptions in fishing, mining, and agriculture.
Against this background, growth decelerated to 2.4 percent in 2014, from 5.8 percent a year earlier.
The current account deficit narrowed slightly to 4.0 percent of GDP, despite a further deterioration
in the terms of trade, and international reserves fell as capital inflows were insufficient to cover the
current account deficit. With weaker economic activity, labor market conditions softened towards
the end of 2014.
4.
In mid-2014, the authorities announced a
series of packages to stimulate the economy.
Measures included one-off bonuses, streamlined
investment processes, and permanent cuts in income
taxes (Box 1). Part of the package was executed in 2014,
resulting in a fiscal deficit and a fiscal impulse of about ¼
percent of GDP. Strong tax collection and one-off
revenue gains compensated for declining mining
revenues.1 Current expenditure continued to rise, partly

advantage of favorable financing conditions and placed US$500 million in 36-year global bonds in
2014. Moody’s raised Peru’s rating to A3 (at par with Mexico), while S&P and Fitch rated Peru BBB+.
5.
Monetary policy was eased against a widening negative output gap and stable
inflation expectations. Headline inflation hovered above the 3 percent upper limit of the target
band in 2014 and early 2015 due to high food prices and some pass-through from the depreciation
of the nuevo sol. However, inflation excluding food and fuel and expectations remained within the
band. Between November 2013 and January 2015,

In previous Article IV consultations, staff and the authorities broadly agreed on policy
issues. Fund technical assistance and staff analyses were an input for the fiscal framework launched
in the 2015 budget. The authorities are also implementing staff recommendations on public assets
and liabilities management and on capital market reform, with the aim of creating a special offering
regime for small-and medium-sized enterprises and reducing transaction costs in the stock market.
Several FSAP recommendations have been taken on board. There is broad agreement on the
structural reforms that are needed to boost potential growth. Finally, open communication remains
a core component of the policy dialogue with the authorities, who continue to publish the
concluding statement and the Staff Report and actively collaborate with staff on analytical projects.
Staff and the authorities are preparing a joint book on Peru and several outreach seminars ahead of
the 2015 IMF-World Bank Annual Meetings in Lima.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
9.
Growth in 2015 is expected to recover supported by domestic conditions. In staff’s
baseline scenario, real GDP is projected to expand at about 3¾ percent this year, on the assumption
that temporary supply shocks unwind. The recovery also critically hinges on executing the public
investment budget and the stimulus measures, with the 2015 fiscal deficit projected to rise to
2 percent of GDP. Inflation is expected to converge to the middle of the target band of 2 percent by
end-2015 as domestic supply shocks dissipate. The 2015 external current account deficit is projected

to remain elevated, given weak external conditions, but would be broadly financed by long-term

10.
Staff estimates medium-term growth in line with potential. Staff expects growth to rise
in 2016–17, assuming mines approach production capacity, planned public-private partnerships and
“Public Works in Lieu of Taxes” projects are implemented,8 and shocks to terms of trade fade, with
the output gap closing by 2018. For the medium term, staff estimates that potential growth may
have fallen to about 4½ percent (Box 3), given prospects of flat metal prices, moderating growth in
China, and relatively weaker investment.9 The current

Downside risks to the outlook dominate, but Peru is in a strong position to respond to
shocks.


Downside external risks include: a further slowdown in the growth of China; even lower terms of
trade; or a surge in global financial volatility. A surge in volatility triggered for instance by
surprises about the liftoff in U.S. interest rates could lead to a reversal of capital flows and
financial pressures on emerging markets, with knock on effects on commodity prices.
A persistent strengthening of the U.S. dollar is also a risk for Peru given dollarization.

Downside domestic risks include: weaker investment; uncertainty given the 2016 Presidential
elections; continuing social tensions in mining regions;10 and a stronger than expected impact
from El Niño weather phenomenon. Moreover, a slower pace of structural reforms could further

The authorities concurred that the economy would return to a higher growth
trajectory in 2015 and the medium term, but project a somewhat faster recovery than staff.
The authorities were confident that supply disruptions in primary sectors would resolve in 2015
(contributing 1½ percentage points to growth), consumption would remain supportive, and
investment—both private and public—would rebound from last year’s dip. For 2015, the authorities
project growth of around 4 percent. For the medium term, they estimate higher potential growth of
5 percent, primarily based on a more favorable investment outlook than staff’s, especially linked to
infrastructure projects. There was agreement that structural reforms were critical to boost
competitiveness and productivity against less favorable external conditions over the medium term.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Securing the Recovery
13.
Within the constraints of a still weak external environment, staff assessed the policy
mix as broadly adequate to support the recovery and maintain macroeconomic stability. Tax
cuts, higher public spending, and accommodative monetary conditions should provide needed
stimulus to activity. Under the baseline scenario, growth is expected to improve in 2015, but the
negative output gap will close only gradually by 2018. The immediate priority is timely
implementation of the stimulus package (rather than additional fiscal measures), with a focus on
public investment. If negative shocks materialize, exchange rate flexibility should be the main line of
defense, liquidity could be provided to avoid an undue contraction in credit, and monetary
conditions could be eased if downside risks to inflation projections become evident.
14.
In April, the authorities revised the 2015 fiscal deficit target as permitted by the
escape clauses to incorporate the stimulus package. They raised the overall fiscal deficit target to
2 percent of GDP, consistent with stimulus of 1½ percent of GDP and financed mainly through
domestic sources. The revised target exceeds the original indicative structural deficit target of 1
percent of GDP under the fiscal rule given lower taxes. It also incorporates an ambitious yet more
realistic public investment envelope and a re-prioritization of spending on operation and
maintenance. The authorities also outlined the exceptional economic circumstances for deviating
from the fiscal rule and a gradual consolidation plan starting in 2016. They underscored that fiscal
consolidation should commence in 2016 as growth gained speed, but noted that the incoming
administration would need to determine the fiscal path for 2017 and beyond as required by the new
fiscal framework. They also indicated that the Fiscal Council will be established in 2015.
15.
Staff agreed that the sharp slowdown in growth warranted a fiscal stimulus that
should be gradually withdrawn from 2016 onwards. Staff concurred that the adoption of the
revised target along with the adjustment path was an important signal of commitment to fiscal
sustainability and would help maintain the credibility of the fiscal framework. Staff also noted that
the early formulation of high quality measures could further enhance the credibility of the fiscal
adjustment path. For the medium term, staff reiterated its previous recommendation to target a
small structural fiscal surplus of around ½ percent of GDP to preserve buffers in the face of
commodity shocks, contingent liabilities, and natural disaster risks (Appendix III).
16.
The authorities remain committed to stepping up public investment execution, given
its higher effectiveness in stimulating growth in the short and the long run. They initiated
several actions to strengthen investment execution capacity and to capitalize on private sector
expertise through joint infrastructure projects. Staff recommended embedding public-private
partnerships in the medium- and long-term budget planning and debt sustainability analysis to
ensure that commitments remain manageable and contingent liabilities and risks are transparently
reported. On the “Public Works in Lieu of Taxes” projects, staff recognized that they could offer a
pragmatic solution in current circumstances to deliver on infrastructure needs at the sub-national

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PERU

level, but advised that they be monitored closely adhering to high transparency standards.
The authorities agreed that hikes in non-priority current spending should be avoided and explained
that the new fiscal path had taken into consideration the need to close a wide infrastructure gap and
persevere with structural reforms to increase long-term growth.
17.
The authorities recognized that the recent erosion of tax revenues would need to be
offset over the medium term to support investment and inclusion along a consolidation path.
They noted that the cut in corporate income taxes had aligned rates in Peru with the rest of the
region and would support private investment and growth. However, staff emphasized the tax cuts
had amplified the existing tax collection gap, both with respect to peers and to the tax effort
expected for Peru’s level of development, at a time when commodity fiscal revenues were declining.
The authorities agreed that compensatory measures should unwind the revenue losses and aim to
enhance the equity and efficiency of the tax system by widening the tax base, streamlining
exemptions, promoting formalization, boosting the collection of local property taxes, and reviewing
excise taxes to address negative externalities. Staff welcomed the important efforts made by the
revenue administration to transition towards a client-based institution and support revenue goals.
18.
There was broad agreement that monetary policy should remain responsive to
inflation expectations and external developments. Staff acknowledged that monetary policy
continued to respond effectively to changing conditions, while expectations remained well
anchored. Staff highlighted that a widening negative output gap and a more complete pass-through
of low commodity prices could create some space for monetary policy. At the same time, the room
for further easing could be constrained by pressure in the FX market in the context of the
anticipated U.S. monetary policy normalization. The BCRP noted that under the baseline scenario the
rise in U.S. interest rates would proceed gradually, with near-term constraints to monetary policy in
Peru likely to be limited. Liquidity buffers and reserves would allow the authorities to manage a
potential surge in global financial volatility.
19.
Staff emphasized that exchange rate flexibility should be the main line of defense
against downside external risks.12 Exchange rate flexibility would help cushion any additional
pressures from further declines in commodity prices and the expected normalization of U.S.
monetary policy. It would also support the authorities’ de-dollarization agenda by creating
incentives for deepening markets for FX derivatives as the private sector appropriately internalizes
the costs of un-hedged FX exposures. Staff also advised the authorities to consider the case for
regulations on foreign currency exposure of pension funds, as these are large market players.
20.
The authorities reiterated their commitment to exchange rate flexibility, but
underscored the need to contain excessive volatility in a still dollarized economy. They
stressed that financial dollarization posed risks to balance sheets; FX intervention aimed to contain
these risks without targeting any level or path for the exchange rate. The authorities also noted that
12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

PERU

the costs of FX intervention through FX swaps had been negligible, in particular compared to the
gains from valuation changes in NIR due to the depreciation of the nuevo sol.

B. Solidifying Financial Stability
21.
The authorities concurred that the financial system remained stable, with no evidence
of imminent systemic risks (Appendix IV). They noted that financial institutions with worsening
balance sheets such as cajas rurales were a small share of the financial system and held sufficient
loss-absorbing capital of 14¾ percent at end-2014. Moreover, the authorities’ stress tests showed
that the financial system would remain resilient to tail risks of weak economic activity and large
exchange rate depreciation. The authorities also underlined that the legal framework for bank
resolution was in line with best practices and that they continue to strengthen supervisory and
regulatory standards in line with FSAP recommendations and Basel III principles.
22.
Staff welcomed the new de-dollarization measures. Given heightened market volatility
and weak economic activity, staff cautioned that financial market developments would need to be
followed closely and the de-dollarization measures implemented flexibly to ensure a smooth flow of
credit and avoid liquidity-maturity mismatches. Staff also discussed other de-dollarization options,
such as a strengthening of prudential requirements on dollar lending to un-hedged borrowers by
the bank supervisor, which could be effective in addressing FX risk without undue pressure on dollar
deposits and covered dollar loans.13 In this regard, improving data collection and analysis of private
sector balance sheets would allow a better assessment of systemic risks from currency mismatches
and inform any need for additional targeted macro-prudential tools.
23.
Staff also emphasized that deepening financial and capital markets would help
de-dollarization efforts. Despite recent progress, Peru’s capital market remains underdeveloped by
regional standards. For instance, the average turnover ratio for secondary bond markets was
½ percent in 2014, compared to 56 percent in Chile, and the share of transactions in FX derivatives
in the FX market was very low compared to the average for emerging economies (Box 2). Recent IMF
technical assistance suggested that developing a deeper and more liquid money market, easing
restrictions on the use of derivatives by pension funds, and building the capacity of supervisory staff
would help address remaining structural and regulatory constraints.
24.
The authorities broadly agreed with staff’s views on the de-dollarization measures.
They did not see a material risk of capital outflows due to higher reserve requirements on dollar
deposits. They noted that the largest dollar depositors were pension funds, which were subject to a
binding prudential limit on investment abroad. Commercial banks agreed with the authorities’ view
that the risk of capital outflows due to the new measures was limited and welcomed the
coordinating role of the BCRP in moving towards lower credit dollarization. The authorities

Although credit dollarization amounts to 36 percent, estimates by the Superintendence of Banks, Insurance, and
Pension Funds (SBS) show that only 13 percent of total credit (5 percent of GDP) is exposed to FX credit risk.

27.
The authorities’ broad-based structural reform agenda tackles important challenges.
Staff noted that the ambitious education reform and inclusion polices were already showing
noteworthy results and should stay their course within the framework of fiscal discipline. Ongoing
efforts to reform the civil service, streamline permit procedures, strengthen public enterprise
governance, simplify public investment processes, enhance innovation, and diversify exports were
also steps in the right direction. Finally, the OECD Country Program with Peru could provide a useful

new platform for designing reforms and strengthening policies.14 Staff also emphasized the
importance of persevering with labor market reform, focusing on reducing non-wage costs and
streamlining work rules. Strong across-the-board political commitment remained essential for
fostering reform efforts in the short and medium term.

STAFF APPRAISAL
28.
Peru remains one of the best performing economies in Latin America, with solid
macroeconomic policies and visible gains in poverty reduction. Challenging external conditions,
coupled with domestic supply shocks, were an important drag on economic activity in 2014. In the
face of a widening negative output gap, loosening the macroeconomic policy stance was
appropriate. Growth is expected to recover in 2015 and over the medium-term, contingent on
production at new mines approaching capacity, priority infrastructure projects proceeding according
to plan, and external shocks fading.
29.
Important risks loom on the horizon, but strong policy frameworks and fundamentals
place Peru in a comfortable position to respond to future shocks. The external environment is
expected to continue to pose downside risks, from further slowdown in China, lower terms of trade,
or a surge in global financial volatility. Weak investment confidence and uncertainty given upcoming
elections may also entail downside domestic risks. On the other hand, a faster unwinding of last
year’s supply shocks or a more complete pass-through of lower global prices are upside risks. If
negative shocks materialize, exchange rate flexibility should be the main line of defense, liquidity
could be provided to avoid an undue contraction in credit, and monetary conditions could be eased
if downside risks to inflation projections become evident. While fiscal buffers are ample, the
immediate priority is to follow through with the approved investment envelope rather than consider
additional fiscal measures.
30.
The 2015 fiscal stimulus was timely but should be gradually withdrawn. Careful
expenditure management and revenue mobilization will be essential to return to the original fiscal
path by 2018, while attending to social and infrastructure needs. Hikes in non-priority current
spending should be avoided, given the need to finance structural reforms, carry through the civil
service reform, increase allocations for physical and human capital investment, and protect social
programs. Over the medium term, it would be advisable to target a small structural fiscal surplus of
½ percent of GDP to preserve buffers in light of commodity shocks, natural disaster risks, and
contingent liabilities. Continued strong political commitment to the new fiscal framework is essential
to maintain its credibility.
31.
Monetary policy has been adequately accommodative. Inflation excluding food and fuel
has stayed within the band and expectations remain well anchored. Looking ahead, monetary policy
should continue to respond to changes in inflation expectations and external developments.
14

14

Program discussions will take place over the next two years, reviewing best practices in 18 key public policy areas.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PERU

Exchange rate flexibility will be key to cushion any additional external pressures, while limited
foreign exchange intervention may be necessary to smooth excessive volatility that could lead to
disorderly market conditions and undermine macro-financial stability.
32.
The new de-dollarization measures will help address a key structural vulnerability of
the financial system. However, financial market developments will need to be monitored closely
and the de-dollarization measures implemented flexibly to ensure a smooth flow of credit.
Strengthening prudential requirements on dollar lending to un-hedged borrowers and improving
data and analysis of private sector balance sheets could prove helpful in this process. Exchange rate
flexibility would support de-dollarization by appropriately encouraging the private sector to hedge
its foreign currency exposures. Deepening financial and capital markets should also be an important
component of the de-dollarization agenda.
33.
Despite weaker economic conditions, the financial system remains stable. The recent
deterioration in the quality of the loan portfolio of non-bank financial institutions warrants close
monitoring and supervision. While these institutions are small and non-systemic, they serve a large
number of relatively vulnerable clients. More effective use of existing programs to support small and
medium-size enterprises could help mitigate the impact of the growth slowdown and the softening
of labor market conditions. Balance sheet information for medium and small firms and households
should be collected to better assess risks from currency mismatches.
34.
Structural reforms are critical to boost growth potential and advance social inclusion.
The continued slide in metal prices, the moderation of growth in China, and the decline in
investment suggest that potential growth may have fallen from the heights of the last decade.
Boosting potential growth requires steadfast implementation of structural reforms to enhance
productivity, investment, human capital, and formal employment. Streamlining legal requirements
and red tape is rightly a reform priority of the government and the ambitious education reform and
inclusion polices should stay their course within the framework of fiscal discipline. Persevering with
labor market reform remains a challenge.
35.
It is proposed that the next Article IV Consultation with Peru take place on the
standard 12-month cycle.

Box 1. Peru: Fiscal and Structural Measures to Stimulate Growth and Investment1
In mid-2014, the authorities announced a series of stimulus packages with a total net cost of about 2
percent of GDP. About a ¼ percent of GDP was spent in 2014,2 with the rest of the measures planned for
2015. Some structural measures are awaiting approval by congress.
On the revenue side, the authorities estimate the
tax cuts would result in a revenue loss of about
0.7 percent of GDP in 2015. The personal income
tax rate was cut for the lowest income segment
from 15 to 8 percent. The corporate tax rate will
decline gradually from 30 to 26 percent over the
next four years, while the dividend tax will
increase for payments to non-residents. A
gradual elimination of VAT withholding schemes,
which were deemed to negatively affect the
liquidity of small firms, and a gradual reduction
of the drawback mechanism seen as an export
subsidy, were also adopted. Changes were also
introduced to the temporary tax on net assets
and to the General Sales Tax, along with other
amendments to the Tax Code.3

On the regulatory side, speeding up investment is mostly targeted at streamlining requirements for both
public and private investment. For example: (i) the maximum time for registrations, amendments and
registration renewals required for large-scale investment projects will be reduced by 25 percent; (ii) changes
in the approval of archeological certificates is expected to reduce discretion and add predictability to
investments; (iii) a tax benefit and the accelerated depreciation benefit for hydroelectricity generation will be
extended until 2025, targeting investment of US$3 billion; (iv) an increase in the depreciation rate from 5 to
20 percent was introduced to spur housing construction; and (v) the percentage of mining revenues that
may be used for infrastructure maintenance was increased from 20 to 40 percent.
Other measures include:


Expedited land expropriation for infrastructure projects.



Greater funding and subsidies to encourage productivity in the small business sector.



More direct contracting between public sector and suppliers and between the Peruvian and foreign
states in all sectors.



Standardized requirements for public procurement and prevention of price collusion.

Fiscal multipliers of expenditure and revenue measures on growth depend on various factors, including the
economic cycle and structural characteristics. According to BCRP (Inflation Report, 2012), tax cuts have small
multipliers in Peru due to changes in the propensity to consume. The largest bang for the nuevo sol during
downturns comes from increasing capital spending, with a multiplier of ½–1½ in the short and medium
terms, while current spending has a multiplier of ¼–1. IMF Working Paper 14/93 calculates a short-term
multiplier of about ½ for middle income emerging economies like Peru. For 2015, staff estimates the
contribution of the fiscal measures to GDP growth at about ½ percentage point.

Box 2. Peru: Measures to Foster De-Dollarization1
Instability and hyperinflation during the 1970–80s resulted in financial dollarization of about 80 percent of
credits and deposits by the end of the 1990s. The process of de-dollarization began in the early 2000s and is
still ongoing at a steady pace, following policy initiatives that included:
 An inflation targeting framework, which anchored inflation to the level of advanced economies.
 Prudential measures, including differential reserve requirements on local currency versus foreign currency
deposits and additional provisioning, liquidity, and capital requirements for FX loans. Based on the Fund’s
institutional view on the liberalization and management of capital flows, the marginal reserve
requirement on local currency short-term deposits of some non-resident financial entities is assessed as a
capital flow management measure. In December 2014, the reserve requirement ratios were equalized
across all types of local currency deposits.
 Development of capital markets in local currency and the de-dollarization of public debt.
Despite significant progress, 38 percent of credit and 43 percent of deposits were still denominated in U.S.
dollars at end-2014. Similarly, about 40 percent of transactions (estimated by payments and withdrawals
from the banking system) were conducted in U.S. dollars. Financial and transactional dollarization is
particularly high in the corporate sector. About 60 percent of credits to the corporate sector were
denominated in U.S. dollars at end-2014 and a 2013 Survey by the BCRP shows that about 58 percent of the
value of transactions in inputs/supplies among firms was denominated in U.S. dollars.
In December 2014, the BCRP introduced a new set of measures aimed at the de-dollarization of credit:
 New Repos in nuevo soles to support the growth of credit in local currency and to encourage the
substitution of foreign currency loans with local currency loans. In the first case (expansion), financial
institutions can conduct Repos in local currency with the BCRP up to the equivalent of 10 percent of their
required foreign currency reserves, using these reserves as collateral, to expand new credits in local
currency (Figure a). In the second case (substitution), financial institutions can access liquidity in local
currency from the BCRP if they want to convert their foreign currency loans (assets) into local currency
loans (Figure b).

Box 2. Peru: Measures to Foster De-Dollarization (concluded)


Higher reserve requirements on foreign currency deposits. The marginal reserve requirement on
foreign currency deposits was increased by 10 percentage points effective in January and by
another 10 percentage points effective in March, 2015 to 70 percent. In addition, reserve
requirements on foreign currency deposits will be increased for financial institutions that do not
meet certain de-dollarization targets for credits excluding foreign trade and long-term investment
financing. Specifically, financial institutions that do not reduce the balance of their foreign-currency
loans by 5 percent (by June 2015) or by 10 percent (by December 2015), compared to the balance in
September 2013, will face additional reserve requirements on foreign currency deposits. Additional
reserve requirements will apply on dollar deposits if mortgage and vehicle credits in foreign
currency do not fall by more than 10 percent by June and 15 percent by December 2015, compared
to levels in February 2013.

While these measures could reduce dollarization incrementally, experience shows that deepening financial
and capital markets is an effective way to achieve lasting de-dollarization. For instance, Israel’s and Poland’s
success in de-dollarization is associated with an active policy of de-dollarizing public debt, deepening the
local-currency bond market, and promoting the development of markets for FX derivatives along with
increased FX flexibility. Deep and liquid bond markets in local currency provide alternative investment
vehicles to dollar deposits. Also, advanced financial markets with opportunities for hedging instruments and
indexed local bonds can reduce the need for foreign currency to hedge against FX risks.
In Peru, efforts to develop the local capital market have

for emerging economies. Recent initiatives, including
new regulations on repo markets, improving the safety of the securities clearing and settlement systems,
and creating a reference rate (interbank overnight rate) based on effective transactions are welcome steps.

Box 3. Peru: Reassessing Potential Growth After the Investment Boom1
Peru’s productive capacity increased over the last decade. A series of structural reforms and the
implementation of solid macroeconomic and investment frameworks allowed the country to take advantage
of a sizable and prolonged improvement in its terms of trade and historically low global interest rates. The
result was a surge in investment and FDI flows, and a significant improvement in productivity. During
2003−13 growth averaged 6.2 percent—with

a reassessment of potential growth. The two apparent
secular factors that provided a strong tailwind to
growth—positive terms of trade changes and low U.S. interest rates—have started to reverse, and
investment growth has softened. To assess how potential growth will be impacted, staff projected factors of
production and estimated a TFP regression model based on changes in terms of trade and an index of
structural reforms to forecast future TFP movements.

structural improvements—potential growth would only be 3.2 percent. Staff’s baseline scenario estimates
potential growth at 4½ percent, assuming structural reforms proceed at a slightly faster pace in line with the
authorities’ reform plans (with their contribution to TFP partially offset by lower metal prices).

Change in gross public sector debt

Sources: National Authorities; Fund staff estimates.
1/ Public sector is defined as non-financial public sector.
2/ Based on available data.
3/ Bond Spread over U.S. Bonds.
4/ Defined as interest payments divided by debt stock at the end of previous year.
5/ Derived as [(r - p(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; p = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;
a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
6/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 4 as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
7/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as ae(1+r).
8/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes during the projection period.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

Appendix I. Peru: Social and Financial Inclusion1
Over the last decade, Peru has made progress in expanding access to financial and social
services, effectively increasing the number of stakeholders in the economy. To achieve
further gains in inclusion, the authorities are adding to existing successful programs and
implementing a variety of interesting new initiatives.

Mineral extraction also places additional demands
on scarce resources, such as land and water, which are often crucial for the livelihoods of nearby
communities.
3.
Other important challenges include high rural poverty, malnutrition, and youth
unemployment. For example, the poverty rate is over 46 percent in rural areas and only 15 percent
in urban settings, while some 15 percent of children suffer from chronic malnutrition. Moreover,
given that approximately half of past poverty reduction is attributed to growth (with the remaining
portion linked to redistributive policies), stronger efforts will be needed to continue advancing social
inclusion in a lower growth environment.

strategy (Incluir para Crecer), which covers all stages of life. Social spending in 2015 will be
raised by 26 percent to fund an expansion in the coverage of Juntos and Pension 65 programs.



Education reforms. Recent efforts center on improving the quality of infrastructure, instruction,
learning processes, and school administration at primary and secondary levels. Specifically, there
are plans to raise basic compensation based upon annual teacher evaluations and additional
training; increase the number of performance-based teaching grants and bonuses; and make
major investments in new school construction as well as renovate older facilities. The length of
the school day will be expanded in a number of pilot schools, and English language classes will
be gradually introduced nationwide. The goal is to raise education spending—from the current
level of below 3 percent to around 4 and 6 percent by end-2016 and 2020, respectively—
through annual ½ percentage point of GDP increments.

financial education. In 2013, it implemented a training program for teachers on financial issues,
and in late 2014 it unveiled a “financial inclusion opportunities map.” The map is an interactive
tool that provides detailed geographical information on more than 150 indicators regarding the
access and use of financial services throughout the country. In addition, it pushed the creation of
more low cost savings products within the financial system. The banking system is also working
to improve access to financial services with the promotion of an innovative “Peruvian model”
based on electronic e-money legislation passed in 2012 and a new unified mobile payments
platform that links together financial institutions, telephone service providers, and customers.
The goal is to leverage the high penetration of mobile telephone in Peru (over 75 percent) and
create a system of mobile payments based on electronic money that can become an access
point for other financial services. The platform is expected to become operational by mid-2015
with simple utility payments and transfers allowed in the first stage.

Appendix II. Peru: External Assessment1
Peru’s external position is assessed to be broadly consistent with medium-term
fundamentals and desired policy settings. The current account deficit is expected to
narrow gradually over time, broadly financed by long-term capital flows. At the same
time, Peru has adequate international reserves and low external debt.

A.

Current Account

1.
The current account deficit declined slightly in 2014, despite lower terms of trade and
sluggish external demand. The current account deficit has widened since 2012, mostly reflecting
deteriorations in the terms of trade and the volume of exports. In particular, the trade surplus that
Peru had recorded since 2002 swung into deficit in 2014. Also, profit repatriation (i.e., profits realized
by nonresident corporations) continues to be large, explaining over 90 percent of the current
account deficit in 2014. Capital flows fell short of covering the current account deficit in 2014 as FDI
flows slowed and portfolio flows reversed, leading to a decline in international reserves.

2.
Staff assesses that Peru’s external position is consistent with medium-term
fundamentals and desired policies settings. The External Balance Approach (EBA) estimates a
current account norm of -2.6 percent of GDP and a gap of 1 percent of GDP after adjusting for
estimated under-reporting of gold exports. This gap is likely to be corrected in coming years as the
current account deficit is projected to narrow given an expected rebound in the volume of mining
exports. Long-term capital inflows are expected to finance the projected medium-term current
account deficit of about 3 percent of GDP.

B.

Exchange Rate and Competitiveness

3.
The nominal and real effective exchange rates were broadly stable in 2014. The nuevo
sol depreciated by about 6½ percent in nominal terms against the U.S. dollar in 2014. However, the
nominal and real effective exchange rates depreciated only by 1¼ percent and 1½ percent,
1

PERU

respectively, reflecting the faster depreciation of the currencies of major trading partners against the
U.S. dollar.2 Meanwhile, cost-based indicators of competitiveness show that Peru is competitive in
mining (with the average cost of copper per pound of US$0.88 vs. Chile’s US$1.42 in 2012), but its
non-cost competitiveness indicators worsened somewhat as measured by Global Competitiveness
Report rankings (2014).

Capital Flows, FX Intervention, and International Reserves

5.
Capital flows moderated following declines in commodity prices and rising long-term
global interest rates. After averaging about 7½ percent of GDP a year during 2010−13, net capital
inflows slowed to about 3 percent of GDP in 2014. An FDI inflow of about 3¾ percent of GDP was
partially offset by net portfolio outflows. Over two-thirds of the capital inflows during the upswing
were FDI flows, providing relative stability to the financing of the current account deficit.

The authorities employ FX intervention and macro-prudential measures to contain
excessive exchange rate volatility and avoid disorderly market conditions. To mitigate the
potential adverse consequences of a sharp exchange rate appreciation, the BCRP deployed a
number of measures including FX intervention (purchases), raising reserve requirements, and
encouraging outflows during 2012−14.

Peru’s international investment position
(IIP) and its composition has improved over the
last decade. The negative IIP fell significantly since
the early 2000s mostly due to accumulation of
foreign assets while the composition of the foreign
liabilities shifted significantly into non-debt
creating items. Foreign assets almost doubled
between 2000 and 2014, on the back of the BCRP’s
accumulation of international reserves. On the
other hand, while total foreign liabilities fell only by
a few percentage points of GDP, the composition
of non-debt creating liabilities (FDI and equity)
almost doubled to 60½ percent in 2014.

Appendix III. Peru: New Fiscal Rules and Implications for Savings1
The fiscal framework approved in 2013 became operational in the 2015 budget. It
includes a multi-annual macroeconomic framework that sets three-year projections for
the main macroeconomic and fiscal variables. The new structural deficit target implies an
important shift in the government’s fiscal policy stance compared to past years as it will
reduce savings as a share of GDP. More conservative targets would be advisable to
preserve fiscal buffers.
1.

The new fiscal framework includes the following elements:



Numerical fiscal rules include a structural balance indicative target for the NFPS.



The current fiscal stabilization fund for the national government can be used if revenue declines
below the average of the past three years or during exceptional crises.



A fiscal council will provide independent analyses of macro-fiscal projections, the evolution of
public finances, and compliance with fiscal laws and rules.

1/ The limit can rise by up to 0.2 percent of GDP in case of budget under-execution in the previous year. If the expected output gap (positive or negative) is larger
than 2 percent, the expenditure limit must adjust, counter cyclically, by up to ¼ of the output gap. When new tax measures yield a permanent change in revenue
of 0.3 percent of GDP or more, the expenditure limit changes accordingly.
2/ In the first seven months of election years, two additional limits apply: (1) the budget execution of national government’s primary spending cannot exceed
60 percent of the annual budget and (2) no measures can be taken that increase future current spending or reduce the fiscal space for the future administration.

2.
A new methodology was introduced in 2014 to calculate the structural fiscal balance.
Non-commodity related revenues are adjusted by the non-primary GDP output gap. Direct taxes
and royalties levied on the mining and hydrocarbon sectors (i.e., natural resource revenue) are

instead assumed to depend on a Peru-specific export price index that reflects Peru’s commodityrelated export basket. No cyclical adjustment is made on expenditures, capital revenue, or the
balance of state-owned enterprises. To calculate the price gap between current and structural prices
and compute structural resource revenues, the methodology assumes a 30-year price cycle
according to which current market prices would steadily decline over the next 20 years, converging
to pre-2002 levels by 2033. Then, structural prices are derived using an HP filter over the 1980–2033
price series, and the price gap is obtained as a difference.
3.
In the original 2015 medium-term framework, the authorities chose an indicative
structural deficit target for the nonfinancial public sector of 1 percent of GDP for the next
three years. However, the authorities revised the targets in April 2015 due to the exceptional
economic circumstances and to account for the expected effect of the new tax measures. The
expenditure ceilings for the general government remained binding. Gradual fiscal consolidation
would commence in 2016, returning to the 1 percent structural fiscal deficit by 2018.

The targeted level of structural deficit will lead to a reduction of savings as a share of
2
GDP. While, over the period 2014−20, the real growth rate of government spending will average
about 5 percent, structural revenue will decline by more than 1 percentage point. Despite the
projected positive commodity price gap, maintaining this level of structural deficit would require to
use any cyclical revenue windfalls (as calculated under the rule), leading to growing overall deficits
and reducing the stock of government’s savings, as a share of GDP, by about 2 percentage points by
2020.3 The general government debt-to-GDP ratio will increase slightly and then hover at slightly
above 20 percent of GDP.

2

During 2008−2013, Peru saved on average the equivalent of a third of its natural revenue, contributing to a fast
decline in net debt and the accumulation of overall public savings of about 15½ percent of GDP by 2014.
3

Projections assume that any fiscal surplus is saved and any deficit is financed by new debt, with no saving
withdrawals, except in 2015. This assumption reflects the authorities’ preference so far to accumulate fiscal buffers
given the relatively low level of debt and the parsimonious use of the Fiscal Stabilization Fund resources.
Alternatively, part of the fiscal savings could be used to finance fiscal deficits, leaving the stock of debt unchanged.

5.
More conservative targets would be
advisable to preserve fiscal buffers.4 A structural
fiscal balance of around ½ percent of GDP, achieved
through careful expenditure prioritization and revenue
mobilization, would preserve the current level of
savings as a share of GDP and conserve enough
buffers to cover against macroeconomic shocks and
contingent liabilities. To avoid sudden adjustments in
the real rate of growth of government spending, and
protect fiscal space for important structural reforms
(e.g., education, poverty programs, and civil service), a
gradual move to a more conservative target would be
suitable. Over the medium-term, higher tax collection
should be achieved through widening the tax base,
streamlining exemptions, promoting formalization,
boosting the collection of local property taxes, and
reviewing excise taxes to address negative
externalities.

Appendix IV. Peru: Macro-Financial Stability Assessment1
Staff assesses that Peru’s macro-financial system is stable, with no signs of imminent
systemic risk. The financial sector vulnerability risk is medium, due to structurally high
dollarization, but prudential buffers remain ample. Corporate and household balance
sheets remained strong on average, but the recent deterioration of small firms’ balance
sheets calls for close monitoring. There is no evidence of over-pricing of assets.

A.

Macro-financial Stability Map

1.
Peru’s macro-financial system remains stable. A comparison of Peru’s latest macro
financial stability map with 2012, towards the end of the commodity boom, shows that the macrofinancial system remains stable albeit with some signs of increased macroeconomic, inward
spillovers, credit, and market and liquidity risks. However, the levels of these risks are consistent with
corresponding global risks as reported in the April 2015 Global Financial Stability Report (GFSR). In
particular, the increase in market and liquidity risks reflects widening foreign exchange funding
spreads and falling stock market turnovers. Risk appetite has come down since the third quarter of
2013, following U.S. Fed Reserve’s (USFR) announcement of tapering its quantitative easing, but is
still higher than the level before the announcement of QE3 by USFR.

The regulatory requirements against FX credit risk include; (i) a minimum package of management measures to
identify, assess, and mitigate FX credit risk, (ii) additional provisions if in the opinion of the supervisor the
management measures adopted prove insufficient, and (iii) additional capital requirement for operations subject to
FX credit risk. To build buffers against potential over-indebtedness of households and micro-and small enterprises,

The regulation, supervision, and safety net of the banking system were assessed to be
of high quality and well developed by the 2010 FSAP update. According to the FSAP report,
Peru’s legal framework for bank resolution is in line with best practices. Recommendations to
strengthen supervision by better balancing qualitative judgment and rule-based standards, and by
making on-site supervision more inclusive, have been implemented by the SBS since then. However,
legislation is needed to establish a special resolution regime for systemic situations in line with FSAP
recommendations.

C.

Corporate and Household Balance Sheets

5.
The recent increase in corporate debt issuance in the international market could be a
source of vulnerability, but macro-financial risks seem limited. During 2012−14, Peruvian
companies issued about 7½ percent of GDP debt in the international market to take advantage of
low interest rates. This along with domestic FX borrowing has created large FX asset-to-liability gaps
in some sectors, making firms in these sectors vulnerable to large exchange rate depreciations. For
instance, a 10 percent depreciation of the nuevo sol in 2015 could lead to losses in percent of 2014
sales, ranging from 1.3 percent for manufacturing sector firms to 4.3 percent for construction sector
firms (Figure 1). At the aggregate level, however, the corporate sector would gain in net terms from
such a shock as gains by the mining and financial sectors would more than offset losses by the
remaining sectors. Balance sheet and profitability indicators of issuing firms and the overall
corporate sector in general deteriorated recently, reflecting declines in commodity prices and the
slowdown in economic growth. Nevertheless, there are no indications of risk to macro-financial
stability as the corporate sector remains current on its obligations to the financial system and the
ratio of current assets to current liabilities remained comfortable at about 2, suggesting that the

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

51

PERU

corporate sector has sufficient liquidity to meet shortterm obligations. Furthermore, Peru has one of the
lowest corporate debt-at-risk ratios among emerging
economies.
6.
Although comprehensive data is not
available, there are indications that the balance
sheets of small and medium firms are
deteriorating. NPL ratios of small and micro firms,
which held about 14 percent of total assets of
depository institutions as of end-2014, increased
about 2½ percentage points since end-2012 to
7¾ percent at end-2014. Similarly, NPLs of medium
firms, which held about 18 percent of total assets of
depository institutions as of end-2014, increased
about 2 percentage points to 4¾ percent during the
same period. On the other hand, consumer and
mortgage NPL ratios have been relatively low and
stable indicating that household balance sheets
remained relatively healthy.4 Although dollarization of
consumer credit is low (9⅓ percent at end-2014),
high dollarization of mortgage loans at 34 percent at
end-2014 remains the main vulnerability to
household balance sheets.

There are no signs of asset price bubbles. After a significant appreciation during the
commodity price boom, the Lima Stock Exchange price index has moderated recently and is in line
with the trend average (Figure 2). The average price-to-earning (PE) ratio of Peruvian firms was
15 percent and was the lowest among regional peers in 2013, indicating no signs of over pricing.
Housing prices continued to increase, but there is no evidence of misalignment from the trend
average and the housing price-to-rent ratio was 15 percent―one of the lowest in the region.

No. 144-(52/51).
Last Article IV Consultation
The 2013 Article IV consultation was concluded on January 23, 2014 (IMF Country Report No. 14/31).
FSAP and ROSCs
Several joint Fund-Bank missions visited Lima in the period September 2000–January 2001 to
conduct an FSAP for Peru. The corresponding Financial System Stability Assessment (FSSA) report
was discussed by the Executive Board on March 12, 2001. A follow-up FSAP mission was concluded
in February 2005. More recently, the Executive Board, on April 20, 2011, took note of the staff’s
analysis and recommendations in the report on Peru’s FSAP-Update. In October 2002, an FAD
mission conducted a Fiscal ROSC for Peru (IMF Country Report No. 04/109, 4/16/04), while an STA
mission conducted a Data ROSC for Peru in February 2003 (IMF Country Report No. 03/332,

WORLD BANK RELATIONS
(As of April 10, 2015)

A. Bank Group Strategy
The World Bank Group support to Peru is defined in the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS)
approved by the Board on February 1, 2012. The CPS is closely aligned with the Government’s
strategic vision of strong economic growth with greater inclusion and is focused on four strategic
objectives: (i) increased access and quality of social services for the poor; (ii) connecting the poor to
services and markets; (iii) sustainable growth and productivity; and (iv) inclusive governance and
public sector performance. The CPS also addresses cross-cutting issues such as those of governance
and gender. The CPS is a result of extensive consultations with government and civil society.
The indicative lending program is at about US$250 million per annum, reflecting Government’s
interest in policy reform support through Development Policy Lending and in reform
implementation support through an investment lending program. The strategy includes
development policy lending operations in the fiscal, social, and environmental sectors mainly
through deferred drawdown options.
Peru’s current lending portfolio includes 20 active projects with a commitment of US$1.7 billion and
an undisbursed balance of US$1.5 billion. In addition to 14 on-going investment lending operations,
there are two active DPL-DDOs (Development Policy Loans with Deferred Drawdown Option) and
two DPL with a CAT DDO (Catastrophes Deferred Drawdown Options) and two GEFs. The GOP took
the DPL-DDOs during the 2008–09 global financial crisis as part of its overall strategy to ensure
adequate contingency funding. New lending commitments since the start of the CPS period total
US$310 million in seven new projects. Some large investment projects (for example, the Lima
Metro II project) and a new CAT-DDO are expected to increase the commitment amounts
significantly during the second half of the CPS implementation period (FY 15–FY 16).
As Peru is becoming a stronger middle income country, demand for knowledge services is
increasing. This growing demand for knowledge is reflected in the increase in the number of
Reimbursable Advisory Services (RAS) arrangements in Peru with the Bank in Education, Social
Protection, Financial Inclusion, Disaster Risk Management, Water Resource Management, Water
Supply and Sanitation, and Justice sectors. In addition to this new stream of RASs, the Bank has
continued to provide analytical services, hands-on support to improve capacities, South-South and
South-North knowledge exchanges and just-in-time support on a variety of issues as demanded by
the clients.
Finally, the Bank’s TF portfolio (currently over US$21 million considering GEF) complements other
WB support in the current core engagement areas of this CPS by providing valuable Analytic and
Advisory Activities and technical assistance. They support the harmonization and alignment of
funding from various development partners behind core government programs.

B. Bank-Fund Collaboration in Specific Areas
Road to Lima events. Peru will host the 2015 WBG-IMF Annual Meetings in October, 2015. As part
of the preparation activities, which involve joint organization with the Fund, the WBG is conducting a
series of events under the “Road to Lima”. The seminars address development milestones that are
essential for emerging economies in the 21st century: from equitable growth and quality of
education and jobs to efforts to address climate change and citizen security. This process will
provide a platform for knowledge exchange on challenges that middle-income countries face as
they are striving to move to higher income levels by sustaining high growth and expansion of their
economies, as well as by improving opportunities for the poor.
OECD. Peru has formally declared its intention to join the OECD by 2021. In July 2014, Peru’s
Minister of Finance requested support from the WBG for the preparation of the Country Program.
While the Bank is finalizing the framework for this technical assistance, it will coordinate the work
with other development partners, including with the Fund.
Tax Reform and Fiscal Decentralization. While the Fund has been active in providing various
technical assistance missions in the tax area, the Bank has finalized a study on Taxation and Equity,
looking at the challenges of increasing tax collection equitably. Jointly with the World Bank and IDB,
staff has worked on drafting laws and regulations for fiscal decentralization. The World Bank has
also focused on the design and implementation of decentralization of the social sectors and propoor spending policies.
Customs Administration Modernization. A needs assessment mission was undertaken together
with the IMF to develop an action plan for modernizing customs administration. The joint team
presented a technical report to SUNAT.
Public Sector Management. Bank-Fund collaboration has focused in the area of results based
budgeting, the implementation of a Treasury Single Account and modernization of budget
processes, institutions and information systems

RELATIONS WITH THE INTER-AMERICAN
DEVELOPMENT BANK
A. Country Strategy
Peru’s current Country Strategy covers the period 2012–16. The strategy has two pillars for the
Bank’s assistance to the Peruvian authorities by supporting (i) their efforts to close economic and
social gaps that still persist between urban and rural areas; and (ii) productivity gains as the main
basis for inclusive, and sustainable economic growth.
IDB’s strategic engagement with Peru focus on nine areas: (i) social inclusion; (ii) rural development
and agriculture; (iii) housing and urban development; (iv) climate change and disaster risk
management; (v) water, sanitation, water resources, and solid waste; (vi) energy; (vii) transportation;
(viii) public management; and (ix) competitiveness and innovation.
The Country Strategy is under implementation. The Bank has worked with the government on a
multi-sector and multi-annual approach of articulated interventions addressing, in a coordinated
fashion, various development gaps at the same time. Also, the Bank’s intention is to diversify the
instruments of support to the country. Innovation in instruments include service contracts with the
government in priority areas (“fee for services”), larger private sector operations, and extended use
of knowledge sharing and technical cooperation.
The Bank’s financial engagement scenario would entail positive net flows to the country between
2012 and 2016. In the base scenario, the Bank will maintain its share as a creditor in Peru’s total
multilateral debt. The lending framework for the strategy is consistent with the demand assumptions
and the external financing strategy of the government.

B. Lending
As of February 2015, the Bank’s portfolio of active, public sector operations consisted of 21 loans for
a total amount of US$890.9 million, of which US$221 million (25 percent) had been disbursed. The
public sector lending program for 2014 comprised seven operations for a total of US$445 million,
which includes the financing the Lima Metro Subway for US$300 million. The public sector lending
program for 2015 comprises two policy-based loans for US$600 million and three investment loans
for US$100 million.
Regarding private sector operations, the Structured Corporate Finance Department’s (SCF) portfolio
in execution consists of eight operations amounting to US$598.3 million mainly in infrastructure, the
IIC portfolio comprises 19 operations for US$120.1 million, primarily in manufacture and financial
services, and the Opportunities for the Majority (OMJ) department portfolio consists of four
operations amounting US$19.1 million, in housing and education sectors. As of December 2014
disbursements for SCF & OMJ total have been US$113.2 million.

Private sector lending for 2015 includes one SCF project for US$57 million in agriculture sector, one
OMJ operation for US$8 million in financial markets, nine MIF projects for US$7 million, and seven

STATISTICAL ISSUES
General. Macroeconomic statistics are broadly adequate for policy formulation, surveillance and
monitoring. Peru subscribes to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS). A data ROSC was
prepared and published in 2003.
Despite progress in recent years, there is scope for improvement in the following areas:
(i) coordination among the agencies that compile official statistics to avoid duplication of efforts;
(ii) expanding the coverage of the wholesale price index to include mining, oil and gas extraction,
electricity and water, public transportation, and communication; (iii) finalizing the migration to the
standardized report forms for monetary data with the introduction of report forms for the central
bank, other depository corporations, and other financial corporation’s; and (iv) expanding the scope
of data sources for compiling financial flows of individual residents.
National accounts. In 2014, the National Statistics Office (INEI) released a new national account
series implementing the 1993 SNA and using 2007 as the base year.
Price statistics. At the present time, the official measure of inflation for Peru is the CPI for
Metropolitan Lima, compiled and published by INEI. Starting in January 2010, the Metropolitan Lima
CPI has been compiled using updated weights based on the 2008/09 Encuesta Nacional de
Presupuestos Familiares (ENAPREF). Since January 2011, city level indices have been compiled and
disseminated for the 24 departmental capitals and another large urban area using weights from the
2008/09 ENAPREF and a methodology matching that employed for the Metropolitan Lima CPI.
A new law issued in 2009 requires the INEI to compile a new national level CPI that will serve as the
official CPI for Peru in the future. An STA mission on the CPI was conducted in May 2–13, 2011 to
evaluate the methodology of the new national CPI index. The new national level CPI, starting with
the January 2012 index, was disseminated since February 2012 The WPI, statistical techniques used
to compile the index generally follow international standards but the weights for the WPI are
outdated, and were derived from the 1994 input-output table and other reports and publications of
relevant ministries.
Labor market statistics. The authorities monitor labor market developments using four indicators:
open unemployment, underemployment, employment, and remunerations. While monthly
unemployment, employment and income data for metropolitan area of Lima from INEI are timely,
only urban employment indexes are available from the Ministry of Labor for other areas and with
some delays; monthly remuneration data for the government are timely but the monthly
remuneration data for the private sector are no longer available. The nationwide unemployment and
underemployment situation is surveyed quarterly. It would be useful to expand the coverage of
labor statistics to national level and develop competitiveness indicators such as productivity and unit
labor cost indexes.

PERU

Government financial statistics. The Central Bank (BCRP) compiles government finance statistics
(GFS) following the GFSM2001, for the general government and its subsectors. Data for all
subsectors are reported on a cash basis and financial assets and liabilities are reported at face value.
The authorities have not yet sent to the Fund information on the components of expenditures by
function. The coverage of published national budget data is narrower than the fiscal statistics
prepared for the combined public sector. The authorities report data for publication in the
Government Finance Statistics Yearbook (GFSY) using the GFSM 2001. No high frequency data is
reported for publication in International Financial Statistics (IFS).
Monetary statistics. The BCRP compiles and publishes the analytical accounts of the central bank,
depository corporations, and financial corporations broadly in line with the methodology
recommended by the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual. The main divergences are the
exclusion of the deposits of other financial corporations, state and local governments, and public
nonfinancial corporations from the definition of broad money; and valuation of some financial
assets held to maturity at cost rather than at market prices or at the lower of cost or market price for
investment securities. At the request of the authorities, a mission visited the country in January 2007
to assist with the migration to the new standardized report forms (SRFs) for reporting monetary data
to the IMF. The mission finalized the SRF for the central bank, recommending improvements in the
classification and sectorization of some accounts. A follow-up mission took place in September
2008. The mission completed the work on the SRF for the central bank and developed a bridge table
linking the source data reported by banks to the BCRP to the report form 2SR (other depository
corporations). The mission identified shortcomings in the management of the database that
generate the accounts of the other depository corporations sector at the BCRP. Although the two
technical assistant missions finalized the groundwork for the migration to the SRFs, the BCRP has
not yet started reporting monetary data using the SRFs. No set date is foreseen for the migration to
the SRFs.
Financial soundness indicators. Peru started reporting data and metadata for financial soundness
indicators (FSIs) with a quarterly frequency in June 2011.
External sector statistics. The BCRP prepares quarterly data on the balance of payments and
international investment position largely in line with the recommendations of the fifth edition of the
Balance of Payments Manual (BPM5). Data are reported to the Fund for publication in the IFS and
the Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook. Departures from BPM5 include the lack of coverage of
assets held abroad and land acquisition abroad by residents; and not recording on an accrual basis
some external debt transactions.
The BCRP has been reporting since August 2001 weekly data on international reserves in accordance
with the Operational Guidelines for Data Template on International Reserves and Foreign Currency
Liquidity. Since August 2006, the BCRP is including the full amount of the liquidity requirements in
the reserve template both under official reserve assets and as a contingent net drain (as specified in
Section III of the Data Template). Peru disseminates quarterly data on external debt with an eight
week lag on the National Summary Data Page with a hyperlink to the Fund’s website.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on Peru
May 20, 2015

1.
This statement provides additional information that has become available since
the staff report was issued. It does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
Headline economic indicators remain broadly consistent with the baseline scenario in
the staff report.


Advance estimates suggest activity in primary sectors started to pick up in March,
with mining up 8.7 percent (y/y) and fishing up 17.7 percent (y/y). The rebound in
mining follows scheduled production plan increases, while the uptick in fishing
relates to the previously announced start of the fishing season. Leading indicators also
suggest an improvement in April, with production of electricity up 5.8 percent (y/y),
the highest rate in over a year.



On the fiscal front, regional public investment grew 31.5 percent (y/y) in April, the
highest rate since February 2014.



Headline inflation fell slightly to 2.98 percent (y/y) in April, back within the central
bank’s target range. Inflation excluding food and fuel was 2.6 percent (y/y).

3.
The authorities have taken additional steps to stimulate growth broadly in line with
staff’s recommendations.


Import tariffs for a group of key agricultural products were reduced to better align
international and domestic prices. If these reductions are passed onto the consumer,
they could help ease inflationary pressures and support economic activity.



A recently approved law facilitates budget reallocations and transfers to accelerate the
execution of the 2015 budget; and a decree enables the issuance of sovereign bonds
(for about 0.2 percent of GDP) to finance 174 investment projects.



A draft law submitted to congress will extend some existing measures until end-2015,
including: (i) the suspension of pension and social security tax payments on holiday
bonuses; (ii) the flexible use of excess funds in unemployment insurance accounts;
and (iii) monthly updates of oil price stabilization bands.

4.
The central bank approved new measures to increase liquidity in local currency,
promote de-dollarization, and smooth FX excess volatility. To provide liquidity in local
currency at fixed rates and longer maturities, the central bank will implement a new repo
operation with banks’ loan portfolios and auction public sector deposits at the central bank.
The increased liquidity will help reduce the periodic spikes in local currency interbank

2
interest rates. To further encourage de-dollarization, the central bank also instituted an
additional reserve requirement on dollar deposits for institutions that do not meet certain
de-dollarization targets compared to December 2014. Finally, an additional reserve
requirement on FX derivatives aims to moderate excess volatility in the FX market.

Statement by Oscar Hendrick , Alternative Executive Director for Peru
May 20, 2014
Key Points


Peru remains one of the best performing economies in Lain America, maintaining a
sustained period of economic growth, low inflation, and poverty reduction for more than a
decade.



Economic growth averaged 6.2 percent in the 2003-13 period, and after a temporary decline
in 2014, due mainly to exogenous shocks, growth is expected to recover to around 4 percent
in 2015 and to reach growth rates above full potential of about 5.0 percent over the medium
term in order to close output gap. It is worth noting that high frequency indicators in MarchApril 2015 already show a turning point, and suggest that economic activity in primary
sectors started to accelerate.



Inflation expectations remain well anchored, and headline inflation in 2015 and beyond is
expected to fluctuate around the mid-point of the inflation targeting range of 1-3 percent.



The external and fiscal positions are very strong, with net international reserves equivalent to
30 percent of GDP. Fiscal savings, equivalent to 15 percent of GDP, accumulated during the
peak of the economic cycle, provide a substantial buffer for future shocks and
countercyclical policies. Unemployment rate is at historical low level of 5.9 percent by end2014. The financial system remains very liquid, profitable, and well regulated. The net
public debt is one of the lowest among emerging markets and industrialized countries, at
only 5 percent of GDP.



These outstanding achievements reflect the authorities’ sustained commitment, during more
than two decades, to sound macroeconomic policies and structural reforms; accompanied by
social policies to ensure that the benefits of growth reach all segments of the society. The
reduction in poverty rate from near 59 percent in 2004 to 23 percent in 2014, and the decline
in the Gini coefficient to 44 percent by 2014, illustrates the progress in social and financial
inclusion.



The main challenges ahead are how to sustain the economic recovery in the near term, and
how to boost potential growth in the medium-term, given the uncertainty of economic
growth among Peru’s main trading partners (U.S., China, Latam), and the evolution of
commodity prices.



Authorities have designed a policy framework, based on three axis, to boost potential
growth: i) building up human capital and reducing informality; ii) boosting investment to
reduce the infrastructure gap; and, iii) reducing red tape and lowering cost overruns. This
policy framework would be critical to provide better quality of labor force to the growth
momentum, while reinforcing the process of the improvement in the standard of living of the
population. In that sense, it is worth noting that, according to Moody´s, the Peruvian
economy, along with Mexico and Chile, is the only one that shows continued momentum to
adopt “second generation” reforms in order to improve long term growth.

INTRODUCTION

1.
The staff has provided a well-balanced description and analysis of recent
economic developments and policy discussions.1 My authorities are in broad agreement
with the staff’s assessment and policy recommendations. We are also grateful for the in-depth
analysis provided in the companion Selected Issues Paper, focusing on the current important
topics of growth and investment dynamics, challenges in taxation, and the analysis of the
Peruvian sol as a possible commodity currency. We appreciate the focus on the consultation
on how to consolidate economic recovery and financial stability, while unlocking potential
growth over the medium-term.
2.
Peru enjoys a favorable business climate and continues to attract foreign direct
investment (FDI), reinforcing the solid conditions for sustained economic growth. In
percentage of GDP, Peru leads FDI in Latin America, followed by Chile, Brazil, Colombia,
and Mexico. As explained in the staff report and in the Selected Issues chapter on
Investment Dynamics in Peru, key structural reforms beginning in the 90s set the stage for
the investment and growth boom during the last decade. According to the latest Doing
Business report, in 2014, Peru was among the top 35 economies (out of 189) that improved
business climate in the world, above Mexico and Chile. My authorities are mindful that with
the end of the super commodity cycle, additional structural reforms are needed to maintain
the growth momentum and enhance potential growth. The country risk premium continues
well below the Latin American emerging markets, reflecting the strength and resilience of the
Peruvian economy. For instance, Peru improved its credit rating even in periods of strong
volatility in emerging markets (S&P: August 2013; Fitch: October 2013; Moody´s: July
2014). Moody’s rated Peru A3, while S&P and Fitch rated Peru BBB+.

3.
The resilience of the Peruvian economy is not only rooted in its strong economic
fundamentals, but also in the ability of the institutional framework to operate under
conditions of strain. It is worth underscoring that the impressive economic growth of an
annual average of 6.2 percent during the period 2003-13, accompanied by the lowest inflation
in the region of 2.9 percent during the same period, took place during three different
administrations. In each of the Presidential elections there were different degrees of
uncertainty related to the orientation of economic policies and the investment climate. Yet,
uncertainty was short lived and investors maintained their confidence in the business climate
and the institutional framework in place. In this context, we do not see the forthcoming 2016
elections as particularly worrisome in terms of affecting long-term investment decisions. We
believe that any delay in new investment would be only temporary and the strong dynamics
of investment and growth will continue with renovated strength in 2016. Moreover, after
more than 20 years of sustained growth and low inflation, the society has learned to
appreciate the value of economic stability and improvements in the standards of living, and
this would be very difficult to change dramatically by any future administration. This may be
perhaps the best guarantee for continued success in the implementation of sound economic
policies.
4.
Peru continues to make improvements with its socially inclusive growth strategy,
expanding access to financial and social services. The reduction in poverty rate from near
59 percent in 2004 to 23 percent in 2014, and the decline in the Gini coefficient to 44 percent
by 2014, illustrates the progress in social and financial inclusion. Unemployment rate
maintains a historical low level of 5.9 percent by end-2014. The substantial expansion of the
middle class (about one third of the population) had important and positive impact on
domestic demand, which has been very helpful to partially compensate for the lower external
demand. The authorities are working hard to make progress on education reform and
financial inclusion, while enhancing the quantity and quality of the social programs, which
currently cover over 5 million people, more than half focused on children and the elderly.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK

5.
After a temporary setback in 2014, economic growth is expected to recover in
2015 supported by countercyclical policies and the recovery of the primary sectors.
Real GDP grew 2.4 percent in 2014, from 5.8 a year earlier. About half of the decline is
explained by temporary supply shocks in fishing, mining, agriculture; and a more than
expected drop in sub-national public investment that more than offset the strong fiscal
stimulus from the Central Government (national public investment grew 17 percent). The
lower than expected growth in China (Peru’s main trading partner), and the additional
reduction in metal prices also contributed to a deceleration in economic activity. Against a
widening negative output gap and stable inflation expectations, the authorities took timely
fiscal and monetary countercyclical policy measures in 2014 and early 2015 to support
domestic demand. The authorities are confident that these measures and the unwinding of
temporary supply shocks will support economic recovery in 2015. Indeed, high-frequency
indicators in April 2015 already show a turning point, and early indicators suggest that
economic activity in primary sectors started to accelerate in March 2015. For instance, in
March, GDP grew 2.7 percent, the highest record in the last 11 months. Furthermore, in
April, electricity production grew 5.8 percent (y/y), the highest record in 13 months, and,
according to BCRP, updated to 15th April, the credit in domestic currency grew 19.9
percent (y/y), the highest record in 9 months. On the fiscal side, in April 2015, the
regional public investment grew 31.5 percemt, the highest record since February 2014.
6.
Headline inflation was slightly above the 3 percent upper limit of the target band
at some moments in 2014, but inflation is expected to remain within the target band in
2015 and beyond. A recent survey by the Central Bank shows that inflation expectations are
well anchored within the band of 1-3 percent for 2015 and the following years. Core inflation
has remained within the inflation target band. Headline inflation fell in April 2015 to 3.02
percent (y/y), close to the central bank’s target range. The Central Bank has the credibility
and the toolbox to maintain inflation expectations within the target band, while providing the
stimulus that the economy may need during the transition period.
7.
Peru has a very strong external position and the real exchange rate is in line
with fundamentals. Net international reserves grew to US$ 61.5 billion by May 5, 2015,
equivalent to 30 percent of GDP. As explained by the staff in Appendix II, Peru: External
Assessment; net international reserves are adequate by any metric, including the IMF
composite adequacy metric, and Peru’s reserve adequacy is well above its regional peers. Our
authorities feel comfortable with this policy, which proved to be very effective in dealing
with the capital outflows during the peak of the crisis in 2008-09, and it is considered a
source of strength by rating agencies, investment banks, and corporations interested in doing
business in Peru. We agree with the staff’s assessment that the real exchange rate is in line
with fundamentals. The authorities will continue to employ FX interventions and macroprudential measures to contain excessive exchange rate volatility and avoid disorderly market
conditions.

8.
The Fiscal position remained strong in 2014 with an overall public sector deficit
of 0.3 percent, despite the negative impact in tax revenues due to the lower commodity
prices and the expansionary fiscal policy from the Central Government. As shown in
table 2 of the staff report, the NFPS balance has been a surplus of an annual average of 1.7
percent of GDP during the 2011-13. Strong fiscal buffers coupled with a net public debt of
only 5 percent of GDP, the lowest among emerging markets and industrialized countries;
provide the authorities with a lot of room to maneuver in order to implement countercyclical
policies when needed. Yet, the authorities are aware of the challenges ahead in terms of
withdrawing the transitory fiscal stimulus and keeping the level of fiscal buffers, while
increasing revenues as percentage of GDP in line with peer countries. This is clearly
explained in the taxation chapter of the selected issues paper, as well as the government
efforts to continue making improvements in tax administration through widening the tax
base, streamlining exemptions, promoting formalization, boosting collection of local
property taxes, and reviewing excise taxes to address negative externalities; while
increasing the efficiency of public expenditure. In the last two weeks, the Ministry of Finance
has taken additional actions to further stimulate domestic demand in 2015. A bill was
submitted to Congress in April 2015 with several policies aimed at providing additional
disposable income to the population,. Also, the Congress has already approved a law in order
to accelerate the execution of 2015 budget through some budgetary reallocations and
transfers, and a Supreme Decree was approved in order to issue bonds to finance important
public investment projects. It is worth mentioning that the authorities also indicated that the
Fiscal Council will be established in 2015 as a sign of commitment with the new fiscal
framework.
POLICY ISSUES AND OBJECTIVES GOING FORWARD

9.
We share the staff’s assessment that Peru is in a strong position to respond to
shocks, should the downside risks to the outlook dominate. The Peruvian financial
system is very resilient to changes in output growth, exchange rate movements, volatility
induced by the liftoff in the U.S. interest rates, and other factors. Severe stress tests scenarios
suggest that the system as a whole can manage very large shocks. The “acid test” took place
during the 2008-09 global financial crises. The Peruvian economy had positive growth and
had a strong rebound in the following year. We do not see the 2016 Presidential elections as a
relevant domestic risk. Stronger than expected El Niño weather phenomenon and continuing
social tensions in mining regions could be important downside risks. Yet, the authorities are
confident the ongoing infrastructure projects and more in the pipeline to be finance under
private public partnership schemes would create the basis for additional private investment
and increasing growth potential.
10.
The Peruvian authorities value the staff’s policy advice and the helpful
technical assistance in a range of key issues including the design of the new Fiscal Rule.
As explained in Appendix III of the staff report, important changes were introduced to
improve the old fiscal rules. The new methodology based on ex ante structural fiscal balance
provides three years expenditure ceilings for the budget formulation. The authorities are

assessing the staff’s suggestions to use conservative targets to preserve the hard won fiscal
buffers. The temporary deviation from the fiscal rule has been done under escape clauses
considered in the new Fiscal Rule , and a gradual consolidation will take place beginning in
2016.

11.
There is continued gradual progress to further reduce dollarization in Peru,
including a new set of measures introduced by the Central Bank in December 2014 .
Despite a successful inflation targeting framework, and having one of the lowest inflation in
the region and in the world for more than a decade (less than 3 percent annual average), by
end 2014 38 percent of credit and 43 percent of deposits were still denominated in U.S.
dollars; down from about 80 percent of credits and deposits by the end of the 1990s. There
are idiosyncratic factors associated with previous hyperinflation (i.e. 7,650 percent in 1990)
that partially explain this apparent inconsistent behavior by market participants. To help
accelerate the de-dollarization process and reduce the currency mismatch risk to balance
sheets of households or corporate, the central bank has issued new repos in domestic
currency to support the expansion of credit in nuevo soles and to substitute foreign currency
loans with local currency loans. The monetary authority also increased the marginal reserve
requirement on foreign currency deposits by 10 percentage points twice to 70 percent,
effective in January and March 2015. The authorities are aware that deepening financial and
capital markets could also be an effective way to achieve lasting de-dollarization. In fact,
several missions from the Capital and Monetary Market Department have provided technical
assistance in related issues, but this is a gradual process and it will take time to develop.
12.
The authorities agree with the staff’s assessment that Peru’s macro-financial
system is stable, with no signs of imminent systemic risks. As discussed above, high
dollarization of financial assets and liabilities remain a key structural risk, but as recognized
by the staff, risks are contained due to large buffers by the financial system. The regulatory
and supervisory banking authority has built safeguard mechanisms by putting in place
regulatory requirements above international standards. It is worth to underscore that banks’
direct exposure to the commodity sector is relatively low, with only about 10 percent of
banks’ credit going to the agriculture and mining sectors. The 2010 FSAP second update
found that the regulation, supervision, and safety net of the banking system are of high
quality and well developed. Moreover, according to the FSAP report, Peru’s legal
framework for bank resolution is in line with best practices.
13.
Looking ahead, how will Peru keep sustained economic growth and further
reduce poverty in order to transition from an emerging market to a more advanced
economy? We need to continue creating the right conditions for private investments to lead
economic expansion, while strengthening regulatory agencies to protect the public interest
and the general public. Peru has made great progress in many areas including civil service,
infrastructure, education, health, protection to private property, capital market, etc. However,
much remains to be done and new generations of structural reforms are being implemented,
as it is currently done in several areas such as: i) strengthening the human capital and
reducing informality (higher public resources allocated to Education and Health sectors, civil
service reform, Competitiveness Agenda 2014-2018, Productive Diversification Plan, etc.),

ii) boosting the investment to reduce the infrastructure gap through a higher use of PPP
schemes, and iii) reducing “red tape” and lowering cost overruns. My authorities are working
in all fronts, including the planned incorporation to the OECD, which could provide the
motivation and the adequate political economy framework, to make progress with the
authorities’ strategy to consolidate sustained and inclusive growth, low inflation, and the
modernization of the country. This will take additional time, but we need to remind
ourselves that it has taken 25 years of continued implementation of sound economic policies
to reach this point.
