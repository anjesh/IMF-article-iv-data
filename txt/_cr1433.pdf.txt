STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
January 9, 2014

KEY ISSUES
Context. Growth remains strong driven by robust exports, tourism, and construction,
despite the recent floods and some slowdown during the 2013 national election. The
outlook is favorable with renewed reform momentum after the elections but slow
growth in Europe, the U.S. tapering, further extreme weather conditions, and sustained
labor market instability continue to pose downside risks, while rapid credit growth and
renewed pressure on deposits could undermine financial stability. The authorities have
continued to implement past staff recommendations, including mobilizing domestic
revenue, taking steps to strengthen monetary policy effectiveness, and implementing
some of the 2010 Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) recommendations.
Maintaining the momentum of fiscal consolidation. The fiscal position has improved
driven by strong revenue performance. Fiscal consolidation should continue to rebuild
government deposits―the only fiscal buffers―in view of the expected decline in grants,
including by making the planned wage increases in 2014 a part of a broader civil service
reform. Implementing the revenue mobilization strategy, better managing contingent
liabilities, and continuing to reform public financial management are critical to rebuild
and safeguard the fiscal space.
Containing macro financial risks and improving monetary policy effectiveness.
Inflation is expected to remain low, but rapid credit growth, increasing bank flows from
abroad, and the buoyancy of the real estate and construction sectors pose macrofinancial risks. In light of recent deposit withdrawals, strengthening liquidity risk
management is a priority. Containing credit growth including by expanding the base of
the reserve requirements―the only monetary policy tool―once deposits stabilize, and
better monitoring of real estate developments are needed to contain risks. Developing
interbank and foreign exchange markets is necessary to enhance effectiveness of
monetary policy operations, help reduce dollarization and allow for greater exchange
rate flexibility. Further strengthening banking supervision and regulatory framework, and
establishing a crisis management framework are also needed to maintain the stability of
a rapidly changing financial sector.
Promoting economic diversification and inclusive growth. Continued improvement
in human capital, including through education and training, infrastructure, and business
climate, as well as further reductions in poverty and inequality, are essential for
sustainable and inclusive growth.

OUTLOOK AND RISK
1.
Political Context. The Cambodia People’s Party (CPP) won the July election but the
opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) refused to join the National Assembly citing
voting irregularities and has been organizing mass demonstrations. In September, the Assembly has
approved a new five-year term for Prime Minister Hun Sen and his new Cabinet.
2.
Growth. Economic activity remains strong driven by robust exports, with garment exports
helped by preferential access to European Union (EU), and tourism with more diversified
destinations. (Figure 1, Table 1). Real estate and construction also expanded rapidly supported by
fast credit growth. Foreign direct investment (FDI) remained strong partly driven by factories
relocating from China and Vietnam. Despite these indicators, growth is expected to stay at 7 percent
in 2013 due to the sluggish global recovery, recent floods, and a slowdown in activity during the
election period. Growth is projected to pick up to 7¼ percent in 2014 in line with the global
recovery and to 7½ percent in the medium term with improvements in infrastructure,
competitiveness, and investment climate (Table 2).
3.
Inflation and credit. Inflation is projected to stay around 3–4 percent during 2013–14
owing to projected stable commodity prices, once the impact of the recent floods on food prices
subsides. Private sector credit has been growing by about 30 percent (y/y) on average in the last
three years nearly doubling credit-to-GDP ratio to over 40 percent. While part of this is due to new
banks entering the market, which increased bank flows from abroad, heightened competition in the
system also contributed to rapid credit growth. In the process, lending rates and interest rate
spreads have declined.
4.
External stability. Despite robust exports and tourism, the current account deficit including
official transfers is expected to stay flat at around 8½ percent of GDP in 2013 due to strong but
moderating imports, and remains fully financed by FDI and official loan flows (Figure 2). The deficit is
projected to decline to 5½ percent of GDP over the medium term with improved competitiveness
and diversification of exports, and lower imports after the completion of large power projects
(Table 3). Gross official reserves stood at US$3.6 billion in November, about 3½ months of
prospective imports. Although this reserve coverage appears to be adequate considering the longterm nature of Cambodia’s external debt, the high degree of dollarization (foreign currency deposits
are more than 1½ times of gross official reserves) suggests that a higher level of reserves—than that
suggested by the reserve adequacy estimates—may be warranted. Consistent with this stable
external position, the real effective exchange rate has remained broadly flat since 2008 and in line
with fundamentals, suggesting little evidence of a fundamental misalignment.1
1

The exchange rate regime is classified as other managed. The CGER estimates show that the exchange rate is
broadly in line with fundamentals, although being subject to large measurement errors, given weak data, rapid
structural change, and high degree of dollarization. The macroeconomic balance approach shows 3 percent
overvaluation while the equilibrium real exchange rate approach indicates 10 percent overvaluation. However, the
external sustainability approach suggests the exchange rate is broadly in line with the norm. The current account
norm is estimated at around 5 percent of GDP over the medium term, broadly in line with projections. The reserve
adequacy estimates range from 2 to 10 months of imports depending on the cost of holding reserves.

Risks and spillovers. The outlook is subject to downside risks. Slow European growth could
affect garment exports, although the impact is likely to be limited as reallocating factories from the
region, such as China and Vietnam, brought their supply contracts to benefit from Cambodia’s lower
production costs and preferential access to the EU market. Cambodia’s direct exposure to
international capital markets remains limited, but U.S. tapering as well as slower growth in China

Policy response and the authorities’ views. Should downside risks materialize, the policy
space to support growth is limited as fiscal consolidation has been slower than expected since 2010.
In case of adverse shocks, this limited room for additional spending should be allocated to high
impact expenditures on development priorities in education, health, and infrastructure. At the same
time, high dollarization limits effectiveness of monetary policy and the declining reserve coverage in
terms of foreign currency deposits highlights the limitations on the National Bank of Cambodia’s
(NBC) lender of last resort capacity to respond to shocks. This limited policy space underscores the
need for vigilance in containing financial sector risks before they materialize. However, should risks
to the financial sector materialize NBC should use its available lender of last resort capacity, while
expediting the implementation of the crisis management framework, including by enhancing bank
resolution powers. The authorities broadly agreed with staff views on the exchange rate assessment,
outlook, risks and the limited policy space. However, they remained cautiously optimistic that the
floods’ impact would be less than projected and expected GDP growth to exceed 7 percent in 2013.

They also viewed external factors posing less risk to growth than domestic factors, such as
prolonged labor disputes.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Maintaining the Momentum of Fiscal Consolidation
7.
Context. Buoyant domestic demand and revenue collection efforts improved the fiscal
position (Figure 3, Tables 4–5) making the 2013 budget revenue targets reachable. Domesticallyfunded spending is also expected to remain within the budget envelope as the increase in civil
service salaries in September 2013 (the lowest salaries were increased up to the minimum wage of
US$80 per month) had a limited fiscal impact (0.1 percent of GDP). Meanwhile, delays in donors’
reporting of foreign-funded spending continue to hamper the timely monitoring of capital
expenditure. The fiscal deficit, excluding grants, in 2013 is expected to narrow further by about
½ percentage points (ppt) of GDP. Despite this progress, the stock of government deposits in terms
of GDP is projected to decline slightly to around 4¾ percent.
8.
The 2014 Budget. The budget envisages an additional 25 percent increase in wage bill,
particularly for low salary bands, to promote human resource development in public administration
and improve public services in line with the authorities’ priorities in the Rectangular Strategy Phase
Three (RSIII). To finance the increasing wage bill, the targets for tax and nontax revenues are raised
(¾ ppt of GDP higher than the 2013 budget target) and other spending kept broadly constant in
terms of GDP, while creating some savings to replenish government deposits.


Plans to further reduce the wage gap should be part of a broader civil service reform to avoid
jeopardizing fiscal consolidation. The large fiscal cost (½ percent of GDP) would increase
Cambodia’s wage bill to 5½ percent of GDP in 2014, beyond those of the peers as a share of
domestic revenue and current expenditure. Therefore, further salary increases should target
containing the wage bill to around 5 percent of GDP over the medium term by expediting civil
service reforms to improve productivity of the civil service. The authorities acknowledged
these challenges and have established two working groups for wage and civil service reforms
to contain the wage bill while improving the capacity and accountability of the civil servants.



Targeting an increase in government deposits despite spending pressures is well placed, but
there is room to increase the envisaged savings (Riel 80 billion) further. Since government
savings provide the only fiscal buffer against adverse shocks, striving to maintain the stock of
government deposits at least broadly constant in terms of GDP remains appropriate. This
would require additional savings of about Riel 170 billion (less than ¼ ppt of GDP) which
could be achieved by stepping up revenue collection efforts to exceed the target and
improving spending efficiency. The authorities shared the staff’s views and reaffirmed their
commitment to rebuilding fiscal buffers. They concurred there is room for additional revenue,
for example by increasing excise taxes and expanding their base, rationalizing vehicle tax,
collecting more tax debt, expanding the tax net, and strengthening customs administration,
including by combating smuggling.

Revenue Mobilization Strategy (RMS). The government’s commitment to continue raising
domestic revenue by ½ ppt of GDP annually over the medium term would help safeguard fiscal
sustainability. With overall current spending kept broadly constant in terms of GDP, the fiscal deficit
(excluding grants) could be reduced by about 3 ppt of GDP from 2013 to 2018, while providing
resources for currently donor supported development spending, including in health and education,
in light of the expected decline in grants. In the process government deposits can be replenished to
about 5½ percent of GDP by 2018, while limiting public external debt to less than 30 percent of GDP
to strengthen Cambodia’s ability to absorb future shocks.2 In this regard, it is essential to adopt the
RMS in 2014, which is based on a three-pronged approach: (i) improving revenue administration,
(ii) implementing fair and efficient tax policies, and (iii) strengthening governance. The authorities
agreed with staff’s recommendations and indicated their near term priorities to reform excise taxes
and the VAT, expand the base of the formal (nonestimated) tax regime, and rationalize exemptions
and tax holidays. In this context, the plans to set up taxpayer services, modernize IT systems,
strengthen capacity of tax officers, and improve governance could start a virtuous cycle. In the
medium term, the introduction of income tax, expansion of property tax base, and better
administration of nontax revenues would further improve fiscal performance.
10.
Safeguarding fiscal space. Careful management of contingent liabilities related to public
private partnerships (PPP) remains critical to contain fiscal risks. The authorities have made progress
in collecting more information about the PPP projects with technical assistance (TA) from the World
Bank. The latest estimate shows that the size of investment projects was around 25 percent of GDP
in 2012, lower than previously estimated. The work on estimating the related contingent liabilities is
still ongoing. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) has established an investment
department as a central PPP-monitoring unit and a debt management department to manage
contingent liabilities and the associated risks. The authorities concurred that these risks need to be
better managed and indicated their plans to continue strengthening the institutional capacity,
including by seeking further TA. They also noted plans to adopt a ceiling on PPP guarantees and list
all contingent liabilities and guarantees in annual budget laws to help improve fiscal transparency.
11.
Public Finance Management (PFM). The adoption of a new chart of accounts with
improved budget classifications in 2015 should pave the way for the implementation of the Financial
Management Information Systems (FMIS) that is being prepared. In the meantime, expediting the
development of an effective internal audit mechanism remains important for successful
implementation of FMIS, planned roll out of program budgeting and the relocation of decision
making and accountability to ten line ministries. In addition, strengthening donor coordination for
timely reporting of donor support would help improve planning and monitoring of capital spending.
The authorities broadly agreed with these priorities, requested continued TA support for successful
implementation of PFM reforms and noted plans to fully implement program budgeting starting
with the education sector to improve spending efficiency.

Arrears. The authorities noted that they have been pursuing discussions with the Russian
Federation and the U.S. to resolve Cambodia’s debt arrears and would prefer to use most of the
debt forgiveness toward development goals. However, an agreement has not been reached.

B. Improving Monetary Policy Effectiveness and Containing Macro
Financial Risks
13.
Context. The only monetary policy tool is the reserve requirements, which have been raised
in September 2012 by ½ ppt to 12½ percent on foreign currency deposits. However, bank funding
from abroad is not subject to any prudential limits, escapes monetary control, and could stop with
tapering in the U.S., leading to volatile liquidity and credit conditions. Large deposit withdrawals
during the election (10 percent of total deposits), which highlight the fragile confidence in the
banking sector, reduced banks’ excess reserves substantially (Table 6), but these deposits started to
return to the banking system in October. Furthermore, the high degree of dollarization and the
absence of an interbank market, which contribute to high precautionary excess reserves, limit the
NBC’s control over monetary conditions and its lender-of-last resort capacity. Although recent
financial soundness indicators (Table 7) do not reveal any immediate concern, Cambodia’s banking
sector is facing old and new risks from a crowded banking system, rapid credit growth, increasing
foreign bank funding, greater real estate exposure, and stretched supervisory capacity (Figure 4 and
Box 1). Therefore, discussions focused on containing these macro financial risks and developing the
interbank and the foreign exchange markets to improve monetary control. Continuing with the
implementation of the recommendations of the 2010 FSAP (Table 8) and ongoing TAs remains
essential, as well as strengthening the Anti Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of
Terrorism (AML/CFT) regime to safeguard financial stability.
14.
Multi-pronged approach. Although low inflation and below potential growth do not point
to an immediate need to tighten monetary policy—via higher reserve requirements—especially in
light of the continued fiscal consolidation and recent deposit withdrawals, steps on multiple fronts
are needed to contain macro financial risks and safeguard financial stability.


More targeted supervision of liquidity risks would improve the resilience of the system against
potential deposit withdrawals or sudden reversal of foreign funding, especially in the absence
of a formal interbank market. The broad definition of the liquid asset ratio (LAR) overstates
true liquidity conditions, as the recent experience highlighted, and calls for better monitoring
of truly useable liquidity buffers.3 This should be complemented with contingency plans by
banks and the NBC to address potential liquidity pressures, including by expediting the
planned revision of standing facilities4 and improving liquidity forecasting in line with recent

3

The LAR is defined as the ratio of liquid assets to weighted deposits, where the liquid assets include cash and gold,
net deposits with banks and NBC, including required and excess reserves, and net loans within one month of
maturity. Some of these assets are not readily available on call.

4

With TA support from the World Bank, the NBC is planning to re-launch the existing overdraft facility as a standing
facility to meet short term liquidity requirements.

CAMBODIA

Box1. Financial Sector Developments and Risks
Cambodia has witnessed a fast paced financial deepening in recent years. Credit-to-GDP ratio has nearly
doubled in the last three years, surpassing peers and diverging from past trends of sustainable financial
deepening. In addition, intensifying competition for market share has increased banks’ risk appetite, especially for
smaller and mid-sized banks which expanded faster from a relatively small base, potentially deteriorating quality
of loan portfolios. Despite fast credit growth, financial access remains limited to about 12 percent of the
population suggesting more exposure to a relatively small group of creditors, intensifying concentration risks.
Entry of new banks has accelerated credit expansion. Foreign banks that started operations since 2011
contributed to more than one-third of total new lending in 2012, often with funding from abroad, which tripled in
2012 and unlike domestic liabilities is not subject to reserve requirements, the only monetary policy tool.
Rapid credit growth amid a shifting funding structure compounds potential liquidity risks. Domestic deposit
growth has not kept pace with credit growth. As a result, excess reserves as a share of deposits have gradually
declined from their peak of 30 percent (mid-2010) to around 10 percent in recent months, notwithstanding the dip
due to recent deposit withdrawals. In the process, the loan-to-deposit (LTD) ratio trended upwards to over
100 percent, a level considered high even by emerging market standards.
Fast expansion of the real estate sector point to emerging financial stability risks. Although the lack of
reliable housing price data constraints a complete analysis, land prices have increased by over 10 percent (yoy)
and loans to construction and real estate grew by over 44 percent (yoy) in September; imports of construction
materials surged and construction approvals for residential units alone quadrupled in 2012, and loan-to-value
ratios (LTV) are showing an upward drift from 60–70.
Proliferation of real estate financing from the shadow banking system adds to overall risks. Some real estate
developers are reportedly offering real estate loans at competitive interest rates, effectively competing with banks.
However, their funding sources remain largely obscure and beyond regulatory and supervisory oversight.
Although the younger demographics and a rising middle class would support some demand growth, supply lags
and exuberance often lead to the overshooting of construction booms, as experienced by many economies.

MCM TA. In this context, the recent swap agreement with the Bank of International Settlements
would provide more room (US$200 million) to respond to liquidity shocks.


Fully enforcing the reserve requirements to include bank funding from abroad in the reserve
base would help contain credit growth and improve monetary control. This should be
accompanied by close monitoring of maturity mismatches for early signs of increasing rollover risks. Should expansion of required reserve base prove insufficient to contain credit
growth, consideration should be given to introducing LTD ratio limits as well as higher risk
provisioning for new loans, especially for high risk sectors.



Better monitoring of real estate sector developments is needed, including by strengthening
reporting requirements for all construction activity and real estate sales. Should recent price
and activity trends intensify, the NBC could introduce LTV limits, especially in fast growing
segments of the real estate market. The proliferation of shadow banking activities by real
estate developers calls for strengthening their regulation, including for licensing and reporting
of funding sources.

The authorities broadly agreed with staff’s assessment and indicated their plans to revisit the
definition of LAR. They also noted that large excess reserves reflected precautionary motives by
banks and proved useful during the deposit withdrawals. However, they preferred continued
monitoring of foreign bank flows and credit growth before taking further measures, including

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CAMBODIA

enforcing reserve requirements on foreign funding and requested TA in macroprudential measures,
such as LTDs and LTVs. They shared concerns regarding weaknesses in monitoring real estate
developments, which requires coordination among several agencies (e.g. MEF and Ministry of Land)
to support NBC’s efforts to improve real estate data collection.
15.
Interbank and foreign exchange markets. The introduction of negotiable certificates of
deposit (NCDs) by the NBC both in U.S. dollar (USD) and Khmer Riel (KHR) is a first step toward
developing the interbank market and laying the groundwork for market-based monetary policy
operations.5 Subscriptions have been limited so far, partly due to deposit withdrawals and reportedly
unattractive pricing. Further consultations with the banking community would be needed to improve
their attractiveness, including by differentiating their pricing from that of NBC’s deposit facility.
Although exchange rate stability has been a hallmark for sustaining demand for domestic currency,
going forward, the development of money and foreign exchange markets should allow for more
exchange rate flexibility. In this regard, encouraging state-owned enterprises to source their foreign
currency from commercial banks instead of the NBC would also help catalyze market development.
Finally, the NBC is preparing to conduct a dollarization survey to help formulate policies to promote
the use of local currency. The authorities noted that the NCDs would require time to be widely
adopted by the banking sector. They also emphasized the importance of exchange rate stability for
maintaining the demand for domestic currency, and considered establishment of interbank and
foreign exchange markets as a prerequisite to more effectively address dollarization in the medium
term.
16.
Risk-based supervision. The NBC’s on-site supervision is increasingly relying on risk-based
targeted inspections rather than full-scale examinations.6 In view of the limited supervisory
resources, focusing on emerging risks and strengthening internal training would improve
supervisory effectiveness. In this regard, stepping up efforts in monitoring LTV ratios, underwriting
and valuation standards for real estate and construction loans would be important, as well as
concentration, related party and credit risks, to preempt excessive risk taking. Improving the quality
of off-site supervision by enhancing the analytical skills and improving data quality will also be vital
in strengthening banking supervision. The emergence of nonresident loans and deposits also
warrants close monitoring, including for AML/CFT purposes. In March 2013, the authorities adopted
the AML/CFT national strategy, which sets out a 5-year action plan to address the deficiencies
identified by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).
17.
Supervisory capacity. Despite continued improvement through recruitment, training, and
TA, rapid expansion of the banking system, including through three new bank licenses in 2012, and
the transition to risk-based supervision has continued to put additional burden on the already
stretched supervisory capacity. In this context, the 2010 FSAP recommendation of imposing
moratorium on new bank licensing remains appropriate. The authorities indicated that
implementing a formal moratorium may signal a closed-door policy to investors, but they
5

The maturities range from 2 weeks to one year with interest rates equal to those on NBC’s deposit facilities.

6

By October in 2013, the NBC has completed on-site inspection of 13 banks including top five banks; five are rated
as “satisfactory”, and eight are “fair” according to a rating scale of good, satisfactory, fair, unsatisfactory and poor.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

recognized the capacity constraints and reiterated their commitment to maintain a tight stance on
new bank licensing and encourage potential applicants to merge with existing banks.
18.
Crisis prevention and management. Strengthening the financial crisis management
framework is critical in managing systemic risks and minimizing potential fiscal costs. In February,
the NBC, the MEF, and the Securities Exchange Commission of Cambodia (SECC) signed a
Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on establishing a policy level Working Group (WG), which
also led to the formation of a technical Core Team (CT). Going forward a two track and time-bound
approach should target strengthening coordination for crisis prevention and signing of a second
MoU on crisis resolution: while the CT explores the types of risk-appropriate joint vulnerability
exercises and the information sharing needs, the WG should focus on identifying and clarifying the
responsibilities of respective agencies in preventing and resolving crisis. In return, these
deliberations should inform the role of respective agencies in the joint vulnerability exercises,
identify further areas for analysis, and help develop contingency plans. In parallel, the NBC should
expedite improvements to the Prompt Corrective Action framework in line with FSAP
recommendations. The authorities agreed with the urgent need to establish a crisis management
framework and reiterated their commitment to move forward with the process. As a first step, with
TA support from the World Bank, they plan to discuss a draft memorandum on crisis management
among the agencies.

C. Promoting Competitiveness and Inclusive Growth
19.
Context. Cambodia has made good progress in achieving the Millennium Development
Goals (Table 9). Rapid growth in the past decade contributed to a substantial decline in poverty from
about 50 percent in 2007 to around 21 percent in 2011. However, a large segment of the population
continues to live near the poverty line and growth continues to rely on a narrow economic base,
contributing to economic vulnerability. Efforts to increase value-added and diversify the economy
remain constrained by low education levels and skill shortages, as well as infrastructure bottlenecks
and weaknesses in business climate. On the other hand, the relatively open trade and investment
regime and proximity to other ASEAN countries point to a high potential in terms of trade and
inward investment. Early signs of manufacturing diversification are evident in recent FDI trends,
which is likely to be reinforced with the implementation of Asian Economic Community in 2015 and
supported by increased electricity supply and multinational firms’ efforts to diversify their supply
chains. Against this background, the authorities noted that promoting competitiveness and
improving human capital as well as further reducing poverty and inequality remain the top priorities
in their recently adopted RS III to sustain inclusive growth.7
20.
Promoting competitiveness. Cambodia’s competitiveness has improved over time, but it
remains concentrated around low value-added garment and agricultural products due to relatively
7

The RS III, which serves as a framework for the 2014–18 national development plan, emphasizes four priorities:
(1) developing human resources to ensure competitiveness; (2) developing physical infrastructure and improving
trade facilitation; (3) promoting agriculture, including crop, livestock, fisheries, and agro-industry, and
(4) strengthening governance and capacity of public institutions.

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CAMBODIA

low wages and productivity (Box 2). Going forward, this alone would not be sufficient to sustain
growth. In order to accelerate diversification and improve competitiveness, continued improvements
in human capital, including through education and training, infrastructure, and the business climate
are needed. In this regard, the reform agenda by the Ministry of Commerce to reduce the regulatory
burden for businesses while improving governance and accountability of government agencies
(including by strengthening the anti-corruption and AML frameworks) would ease constraints on
doing business. Increasing agricultural productivity and further improving rural infrastructure will
also help increase competitiveness in agriculture.
21.
Improving human capital. Cambodia has made substantial progress in education access,
but there is room to improve education outcomes, which is essential to move up the value-added
chain and make growth more inclusive (Box 3). The increase in education spending in the 2014
budget, partly reflecting higher teacher salaries will help contribute to human capital development.
Nonetheless, Cambodia’s public spending on education is low relative to peers, but the room to
increase spending by relying solely on budgetary resources is limited. Therefore, the near term
priority should be improving efficiency and reallocating spending within the budget envelope. A
new initiative, such as establishing a national training fund, could be considered over the medium
term, but this would require successful implementation of public finance reforms, particularly by
improving tax administration and spending efficiency.
22.
Data statistics. Improving the quality and timeliness of economic and financial data would
facilitate better formulation of macroeconomic policies and informed decisions by the private sector.
In view of the increasing foreign funding of the private sector, including through the banking
system, the authorities should start collecting data on private sector debt to monitor and address
the associated risks.

Box 2. Cambodia’s Export Competitiveness and the Implications of AEC 2015
Cambodia’s export-led growth model presents an opportunity to benefit from the ASEAN Economic
Community (AEC) if exports can be diversified. Exports contributed on average more than 50 percent to
Cambodia’s GDP growth over the past decade and are expected to remain the key driver of growth going
forward. While the United States and the European Union (EU) are the primary destinations for Cambodia’s
main export item, garments, total exports to ASEAN have also grown substantially over the last decade
accounting for 12 percent of the country’s total exports at end-2012. Rubber and woods are the main export
products to ASEAN, and represent ½ and about 3 percent of the region’s total imports of these
commodities, respectively. Although, the elimination of tariffs and nontariff barriers by 2015 could help
enlarge Cambodia’s markets for these products initially, the existing trade structure points to the need to
diversify exports for further trade expansion.
Cambodia’s comparative advantage is concentrated in a few types of products, most of which have
low value-added. Compared to the rest of ASEAN, Cambodia’s exports is the second least diversified, only
after Brunei. Based on revealed comparative advantage indices, Cambodia has strong comparative
advantage in world markets in ready-to-wear garments, wood, and footwear, mainly due to its relatively low
wages. These products constitute only a small share of ASEAN’s imports limiting the benefits from market
expansion, while recently increasing market share in vegetables and rubbers point to better prospects in
regional markets. The product space analysis also indicates that Cambodia’s opportunity to expand its
currently competitive export products into new clusters remains a challenge as garments and vegetables do
not have close connectivity with other higher income-potential products.
However, AEC could become a catalyst in
diversifying Cambodia’s production and moving
toward a higher income potential export base.
Cambodia’s central location within ASEAN could
help attract FDI in more diversified manufacturing to
have tariff-free access to regional markets as well as
to Everything but Arms initiative of the EU, while
benefiting from low wage advantage. The ongoing
diversification of regional supply chains could also
help increase FDI in search for tariff-free access to a
larger ASEAN market. Early signs of this trend have
already emerged with rapid growth of FDI in
nongarment sectors.

Addressing infrastructure bottlenecks and labor skill gaps while improving the business climate are
essential to realize the potential benefits from AEC 2015. While macroeconomic and financial stability
remain essential to reap the benefits from larger regional markets, leveraging Cambodia’s central location
within ASEAN would require improving transportation infrastructure, power supply and trade facilitation.
Although the free movement of skilled labor may in the short term address skill gaps— often cited as an
impediment for industrial diversification— it also poses risks of losing already scarce skilled labor to more
attractive labor markets in the region, highlighting the need for continuous improvements in human capital
through education and training. Improving the business climate, including by reducing impediments for
doing business would also help make Cambodia a more attractive destination for investment to benefit from
market expansion.

Box 3. Cambodia: Fiscal Policies for Human Capital Development
Cambodia has made substantial progress in
improving education, but there is scope to catch
up with peers. Despite increasing school enrollment
and literacy rates and declining pupil teacher ratios in
the last decade, further efforts are needed to improve
education outcomes. Business surveys indicate that
skill shortages and mismatches continue to hamper
industrial upgrading, private investment, and
economic diversification. Cambodia’s public spending
on education, including grants, has been broadly
constant at about 2½ of GDP for the past five years,
lower than in peers.
Raising labor productivity and providing adequate
resources for education within a limited fiscal
space pose challenges. Cambodia has relied on low
skilled manufacturing and services to support its
growth. As the country develops toward an emerging
market economy, it will have to rely on more
sophisticated production processes and high-skilled
labor force to sustain its rapid growth and compete in
global markets. However, the room to increase
education spending by relying solely on budgetary
resources is limited. Over the medium term the
challenge is to balance the need to rebuild fiscal
buffers to maintain fiscal sustainability, while
providing room for more spending on education and
maintaining adequate capital spending as grants
decline.

Given the budgetary constraints, the near-term priority would be reallocating resources within the budget
envelope, improving spending efficiency, and securing more donor support for education. For example, the
World Bank public expenditure review (2011) indicates that improving efficiency in health spending could generate
some savings that can be used for other priority spending. Improving education quality without relying on
additional resources, such as targeted programs to reduce dropout rates, strengthening program budgeting for
education, and providing schools with greater autonomy to manage spending while holding them accountable for
outcomes, would play an important role. Cambodia’s spending efficiency for primary school enrollment is broadly
comparable to its peers, but the scores for secondary school enrollment are lower, suggesting that any efforts to
1
raise spending efficiency in secondary education could improve education outcomes as well.
Over the medium term, new initiatives such as establishing a national training fund (NTF) could be
considered to provide additional resources for training and skill development. NTFs in many countries are
financed by enterprises, such as through taxes earmarked for training, although some may also be financed by
public subsidies or donors. The earmarked-taxes are commonly based on payroll, and may include incentive
schemes such as cost reimbursement, grants, and tax exemption or rebate, if firms provide training. In this context,
the NTF requires sufficient administrative capacity and sound tax administration. In addition, the NTF is not a
substitute for formal education and should not crowd out resources allocated to formal education or generate
disincentives to formal education.
Successful implementation of public finance reform program would play a critical role in supporting
human capital development. This would include enhancing revenue administration to provide more fiscal space,
reallocating spending within budget envelope to human capital development, improving spending efficiency and
effectiveness, and preparing the capacity to establish a training fund over the medium term.

Economic setting. Economic activity remains strong driven by robust exports, tourism, and
construction despite recent floods and some slowdown during the election. Growth is projected to
pick up to 7¼ percent in 2014 and reach 7½ percent over the medium term along with global
recovery, improvements in infrastructure, competitiveness, and investment climate. Inflation is
expected to remain low in 2013–14 due to stable food and fuel prices. The external position is stable
notwithstanding a declining reserve coverage of foreign currency deposits, and the real effective
exchange rate appears to be in line with fundamentals.
24.
Risks and policy response. The U.S. tapering and slow European growth could expose
Cambodia’s favorable outlook to downside risks. On the domestic side, rapid credit growth and
emerging risks in a fast changing financial landscape could undermine financial stability; extreme
weather conditions could affect agriculture and growth, and labor market instability could disrupt
garment production and exports. Should these downside risks materialize, low fiscal buffers would
require any additional expenditure to be allocated to high-impact development spending.
25.
Past recommendations. The progress made by the authorities in implementing past Article
IV recommendations is welcome. They have improved revenue collection, formulated a revenue
mobilization strategy, and strengthened public financial management, including improving the
monitoring of contingent liabilities. They have also introduced NCDs to help develop the interbank
market, improved financial supervisory capacity, and established an initial MoU to establish a financial
crisis management framework. Continuous progress in many of these areas remains necessary and is
reflected in the priorities of this Article IV consultation.
26.
Fiscal policy. The strong fiscal performance has continued, driven by substantial
improvement in revenue collection and prudent spending. Fiscal consolidation should continue to
rebuild government deposits―the only fiscal buffers―in view of the expected decline in grants, to
maintain long-term fiscal and debt sustainability, including by making the planned wage increases in
2014 a part of a broader civil service reform. Successful implementation of revenue mobilization
strategy and careful management of contingent liabilities are needed to rebuild and safeguard the
fiscal space. Continuing with public financial management reforms remains important to improve
fiscal accountability and transparency.
27.
Macro financial policies. Rapid credit growth, increasing foreign bank financing and the
buoyancy of the real estate and construction sectors pose substantial macro financial risks especially
in light of high dollarization, which limits monetary policy effectiveness and lender-of-last resort
capacity. Steps on multiple fronts are required to contain credit growth and safeguard financial
stability. Strengthening liquidity supervision and redefining the LAR to better capture banks’ true
liquidity conditions will improve their resilience to shocks. Fully enforcing the reserve requirements
to include foreign funds in the reserve base would help contain credit growth. Should this fail to
slow credit growth macro prudential measures such as LTVs and LTDs could be considered. Better
monitoring of real estate developments, by collecting more data including on developer financing, is
also needed to contain risks. Finally, the introduction of NCDs is a welcome first step toward market-

based monetary operations. Going forward establishing an interbank and foreign exchange market
would be needed to begin addressing dollarization, including by allowing more exchange rate
flexibility.
28.
Financial supervision. The transition to risk-based supervision and the rapid expansion of
the banking system continued to put additional burden on the supervisory capacity, and in this
context, the 2010 FSAP recommendation of imposing a moratorium on new bank licenses remains
appropriate. In view of the limited resources, focusing on key emerging risks would improve the
supervisory effectiveness. Strengthening the financial crisis management framework is critical in
managing systemic risks and minimizing potential fiscal costs. The signing of an initial MoU between
supervisory agencies is welcome, and should be used to enhance cooperation at the policy and
technical levels, and expedite preparation of a second MoU on crisis resolution.
29.
Diversification and inclusive growth. Cambodia has made good progress in achieving the
Millennium Development Goals and reduced poverty substantially. Continued improvements in
human capital, including through education and training, infrastructure, and business climate are
needed to promote inclusive and sustainable growth and further reduce poverty and income
inequality. Plans to reduce regulatory impediments to doing business are welcome, while improving
education outcomes to catch up with peers would take longer term efforts. Given the budgetary
constraints, the near term priority would be improving efficiency and reallocating spending within
the budget envelope. New initiatives, such as establishing a national training fund, could be
considered over the medium term following the successful implementation of PFM reforms.

Arrears. Good faith efforts to resolve external arrears are welcome and should continue.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS1
Approved By
John Nelmes and Masato Miyazaki (IMF)

Prepared By

International Monetary Fund
International Development Association

This Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) shows that Cambodia’s debt distress rating remains low
with all debt burden indicators projected to remain below the respective thresholds. In line with
last year’s DSA, the results also indicate that debt sustainability continues to be vulnerable to
growth, exports, and fiscal shocks, calling for continued structural reforms to diversify growth,
and to mobilize fiscal revenues.
1.
This DSA incorporates some updates compared to the 2012 DSA. The discount rate
is revised upward to 5 percent from 3 percent, reflecting the recent IMF Board decision to link the
discount rate to the 10-year average level of the U.S. dollar Commercial Interest Reference Rate.
The macroeconomic assumptions underlying the baseline scenario remain broadly similar to
last year’s DSA except that Cambodia is now assumed to issue domestic debt (e.g.,
government bonds) over the long term. The debt-to-GDP ratio at end-2012 was slightly
higher than the previous estimate due to larger disbursement of bilateral debts. Cambodia’s
Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) rating remained unchanged at “medium
performer.”2

1

This DSA has been prepared jointly by IMF and World Bank staffs and in consultation with the Asian Development
Bank (AsDB), using the debt sustainability framework for low-income countries approved by the Boards of both
institutions.
2

Cambodia’s policies and institutions, as measured by the World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment,
continue to be classified as “medium performer.” The relevant indicative thresholds, applicable to public and publicly
guaranteed external debt, for this category are 40 percent for the net present value (NPV) of debt-to-GDP ratio,
150 percent for the NPV of debt-to-exports ratio, 250 percent for the NPV of debt-to-revenue ratio, 20 percent for the
debt service-to-exports ratio, and 20 percent for the debt service-to-revenue ratio.

CAMBODIA’S PUBLIC DEBT
2.
At end-2012, the stock of Cambodia’s external public debt, including arrears, stood at
around US$4.5 billion or 32 percent of GDP (19 percent in NPV terms). The debt-to-GDP ratio has
increased from 27 percent in 2008, partly reflecting greater external fiscal financing during the
economic slowdown in 2009 and larger disbursement of bilateral loans during 2011–12.
3.
With greater disbursement of bilateral debt over the past five years, the share of
multilateral creditor debt has continued to decline. The share of bilateral debt, including arrears, in
total external public debt has increased from 50 percent in 2009 to 63 percent in 2012. China remains
the largest bilateral creditor, contributing to more than 50 percent of the total bilateral debt stock and
about 80 percent of bilateral debt disbursement during the past three years. Cambodia remains in
arrears to the Russian Federation and the U.S. (nearly 20 percent of total debt or 6 percent of GDP),
and the status of negotiations of these arrears has remained unchanged since the last DSA. Cambodia
is not servicing its debt with these two creditors. The Cambodian authorities have been in contact with
the Russian and U.S. authorities at least on an annual basis, but further efforts are needed to conclude
agreements under the Paris Club framework. Since prospects for resolution remain unclear, this DSA
continues to assume no debt restructuring, with arrears continuing to build up over the projection
period.
4.
The negligible level of domestic debt remains unchanged. Cambodia has virtually no
domestic public debt at present. There is a small amount of bonds (US$4 million) issued in the early
2000s and some old claims on the government (half percent of GDP, with no interest) that were carried
over from the 1990s and remain to be recorded in the monetary survey.
5.
The authorities have made progress in monitoring their potential contingent liabilities and
strengthening debt management. Consistent with the Debt Management Strategy adopted in 2012,
progress has been made in monitoring potential contingent liabilities, including those related to power
generation and distribution projects under public private partnerships (PPP) that receive government
guarantees. With the support of World Bank technical assistance, the authorities have collected the
contractual agreements of most projects. The latest estimates show that the total investment of all projects
amounted to around $3.2 billion (about 25 percent of GDP in 2012), lower than the previous estimate of
about 50 percent of GDP in 2011. The work on estimating the amount of the payment obligations and the
size of contingent liability has commenced recently. The authorities have also established two departments
within the Ministry of Economy and Finance: (1) an investment department to review and select any new PPP
projects as well as monitor their implementation, and (2) a debt management department to manage the
risks, including those related to contingent liabilities associated with these projects. These two departments
would serve as a central monitoring unit to evaluate and approve new PPP projects, enhance fiscal
transparency, and strengthen information sharing between agencies. The authorities have also been drafting
new laws and regulations on lending and nonlending as well as government guarantees with a view of
adopting a ceiling on government guarantees and listing all contingent liabilities and government guarantees
in annual budget laws.

competitiveness and
investment climate3. Over the long term, growth is projected to moderate to 7 percent. Inflation
would stay at 3‒4 percent during 2013‒14 due to stable global food and commodity prices. In the
medium term, it is expected to average 3 percent, in line with the authorities’ informal target and
partner countries’ medium-term inflation.



External stability: Despite robust exports and tourism, the current account deficit including
official transfers is expected to stay broadly flat at around 8½ percent of GDP in 2013 due to
strong but moderating imports, and it remains fully financed by FDI and official loans. Over the
medium term, the deficit is projected to decline to 5½ percent of GDP due to robust export
growth, improved competitiveness and diversification, and lower imports after the completion of
large power generation projects. Gross official reserves are projected to remain at around
3½ months of prospective imports. External debt disbursement is projected to average about
US$500 million annually during 2013‒18 (about 2½ percent of GDP on average), and with this, the
debt to GDP ratio is projected to gradually decline to 29 percent by 2018.



Fiscal sustainability: Revenue performance has continued to improve and fiscal consolidation
remains broadly on track, although government deposits, the only fiscal buffers in the absence of a
domestic government debt market, remain limited. Domestic revenue is projected to increase by
½ percent of GDP annually over the medium term in line with the authorities’ goal under the
Public Financial Management Reform Program. The authorities’ strong commitment to implement
the Revenue Mobilization Strategy suggests that this goal is achievable. Medium-term fiscal
consolidation is anchored by a rebuilding of government deposits and maintenance of long-term

fiscal debt sustainability, while striking a careful balance to provide resources for Cambodia’s vast
development needs against an expected gradual decline of concessional external funds. In view of
this, domestically-funded capital spending is projected to increase from 1¾ percent GDP in 2013
to 3 percent in 2018 to cushion the decline in externally-funded capital spending from 6½ to
4 percent of GDP, thereby ensuring that the overall capital spending is maintained at least at
7 percent of GDP. With continued efforts to increase efficiency of public investment program and
by keeping the current spending broadly constant in terms of GDP, the fiscal deficit, excluding
grants, is projected to decline gradually from about 6 percent of GDP in 2013 to 2¾ percent in
2018.


Domestic debt: Different from the last year’s DSA, Cambodia’s domestic debt is no longer
assumed to remain zero over the long term. As Cambodia continues to develop, it would start
issuing domestic government bonds to develop its bond market and provide additional fiscal
financing if needed. By issuing net-debt (issuance minus repayment) starting from ¼ ppt of GDP
annually in 2021 and gradually increasing to about ¾ ppt of GDP in 2033, the total stock of debt
would reach 3½ percent of GDP by 2033. This remains low compared to the average domestic
debt in low income countries (LICs) of about 15 percent of GDP. However, this conservative
estimate is in line with the authorities’ intention of not issuing domestic debt over the medium
term in order to focus more on mobilizing domestic revenue and raising government deposits (i.e.,
savings, not borrowing).

EXTERNAL AND PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
7.
Under the baseline scenario, the external DSA shows that Cambodia’s risk of debt
distress is low (Figure 1, Tables 1a and 1b). The PV of debt-to-GDP, debt-to-exports, and debt-torevenue ratios are below their respective thresholds and are projected to decline over the 20-year
projection period. Moreover, the debt service-to-exports and debt service-to-revenue ratios are also
expected to decline over time and remain well below the thresholds throughout the projection period,
partly due to the concessionality of debts. Even though the standard stress tests do not indicate any
major vulnerability, the external debt, especially debt-to-revenue ratio, appears to be vulnerable to
exchange rate and export shocks.
8.
The public sector DSA closely tracks the external debt sustainability partly because
public domestic debt is small. (Figure 2 and Tables 2a and 2b). In particular, the PV of public debtto-GDP and the public debt service-to-revenue ratios would decline gradually over time, and the debt
service-to-revenue ratio would remain low in most scenarios for the entire projection period. Different
from last year’s DSA with a virtually zero domestic debt, the current DSA assumes that domestic debt
will start to increase after 2020 and reach about 3½ percent of GDP over the long run.
9.
Public debt sustainability continues to be vulnerable to a lack of fiscal consolidation and
a permanent growth shock. If the primary balance remains unchanged at the 2013 level, the PV of
public debt-to-GDP would continue to increase, reaching about 24 percent in the long run. Under a
permanent growth shock, if real GDP growth is one standard deviation lower than the baseline, the
ratios of public debt-to-GDP and revenue would also continue to increase.

CAMBODIA

10.
Despite the low risk of debt distress, the stock of debt could increase substantially if the
potential contingent liabilities materialize. The total investment in power generation and distribution
projects under PPPs is large, and if for any reason problems arose potentially leading to a total loss of
investment costs, substantial liabilities would be added to the debt stock. For example, if only one in ten
projects fails, an average of 2½ percent of GDP (i.e., one tenth of the latest estimate of total investment cost)
could be added to the debt stock. Given network externalities, one failure could trigger additional failures,
further eroding debt sustainability. A more detailed analysis to estimate the size of contingent liabilities with
the support of World Bank technical assistance is still ongoing. One option that is being considered is the
value-at-risk approach, which estimates the maximum probable loss due to the nonpayment of power
purchase or power transmission charges plus the termination sale price of a firm in case of default. Other
potential contingent liabilities include the fiscal cost to support the financial sector during a banking crisis. For
example, the median direct fiscal cost of banking crisis in emerging market economies is estimated at
11.5 percent of GDP.4
11.
The authorities broadly agreed with the overall results of the DSA. The authorities indicated that
the macroeconomic assumptions are broadly consistent with theirs, with medium-and long-term growth
projected at around 7 percent on average. On external debt, the authorities indicated that the actual debt
disbursement over the medium term could be more than US$500 million a year considering prospective new
loans. However, they reiterated their commitment to maintain debt-to-GDP ratio below 30 percent over the
medium term, which is also assumed by this DSA, to ensure debt sustainability over the long run. On
domestic debt, the authorities confirmed that there is no plan for domestic bond issuance until 2018 but
agreed that some domestic debt could be considered over the long term in order to develop the domestic
bond market.

CONCLUSION
12.
Cambodia remains at low risk of debt distress under the baseline scenario. The baseline
projections and the standard stress tests show limited risk to external debt given that none of the
indicators breach their thresholds. The most extreme stress tests indicate that Cambodia’s debt
sustainability remains vulnerable to shocks to the exchange rate, growth, exports, and fiscal position.
This suggests the importance of preserving macroeconomic stability, diversifying the economy and
exports, and implementing revenue mobilization strategy.
13.
Staff welcomes progress made in strengthening debt management. Prudent debt
management, including monitoring and managing the potential contingent liabilities, is critical to
safeguard the fiscal space. Staff welcomes the authorities’ progress in collecting more information of
infrastructure projects developed under PPPs and related government guarantees, and looks forward
to the results of the exercise that was recently initiated to estimate the size of contingent liabilities.
Moving forward, staff encourages the authorities to enhance fiscal transparency by adopting a ceiling
on PPP guarantees, and listing all contingent liabilities and government guarantees in annual budget
laws.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
3/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
4/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
5/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
6/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

Sources: Cambodian authorities; and IMF staff estimates and projections.
1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), noninterest current account in percent of GDP, and nondebt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after
the shock (implicitly assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative
As part of the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI), the IMF Executive Board on January 5, 2006
approved relief on 100 percent of debt incurred by Cambodia to the IMF before January 1, 2005. This
resulted in the forgiving of all of Cambodia’s outstanding debt to the IMF, a total of SDR 56.8 million

2

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CAMBODIA

(about US$82 million). The authorities intend to spend the resources over a number of years, initially on
rural irrigation projects. The National Bank of Cambodia (NBC) transferred the full MDRI proceeds to the
Ministry of Economy and Finance effective March 2006.
Safeguards Assessment
A voluntary safeguards assessment of the NBC was completed in January 2010 at the request of the
authorities, which updated the previous March 2004 voluntary assessment. The update assessment
found that the NBC had taken steps to strengthen aspects of its safeguards framework; however,
important recommendations proposed in 2004 were still outstanding, and some new risks had emerged
in the area of external audit.
Exchange Rate Arrangement and Payments System
Cambodia’s exchange regime is classified as other managed. The de jure regime is a managed float. The
official exchange rate, which is expressed in riels per U.S. dollar, applies to all official external
transactions conducted by the central government and state enterprises, and is used for accounting
purposes by the NBC. It is determined by the foreign exchange market, with the official rate adjusted to
be within 1 percent of the market rate on a daily basis.
Cambodia accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 on January 1, 2002. Cambodia
maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers
for current international transactions.
Article IV Consultation
Cambodia is on the standard 12-month Article IV consultation cycle. The last Article IV consultation
discussions were held in Phnom Penh during September 25-October 5, 2012. The Executive Board
approved the staff report on December 3, 2012.
Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP)
The joint IMF-World Bank FSAP mission took place in March 2010 and the assessment was
completed in October 2010.
Technical Assistance
Technical assistance is currently focused on bank supervision, monetary operations, public financial
management, tax and customs administration, tax policies, macro-fiscal and revenue forecasting,
financial sector supervision, and macro-financial statistics. Delivery is through a resident advisor at
the NBC, peripatetic experts, and short-term visits from headquarters.
Resident Representative
The IMF Resident Representative in Phnom Penh (Mr. Faisal Ahmed) was appointed in July 2011.
From July 2010 to June 2011, the IMF’s Resident Representative for Indonesia (Mr. Milan Zavadjil)
also assumed the responsibilities for the IMF office in Cambodia.

IMF-WORLD BANK COLLABORATION
(October 2013)
The Bank and the IMF country teams for Cambodia, led by Mr. Mathew Verghis (Sector
Manager, EASPR) and Ms. Meral Karasulu (IMF Mission Chief for Cambodia), maintain a close
working relationship and have an active dialogue on a range of macroeconomic and structural
issues.
Recent key areas of cooperation and coordination include:


Macroeconomic policy advice to the authorities. The IMF and the World Bank staffs have
consulted each other on key macroeconomic policy messages to the authorities to avoid
sending conflicting messages. Bank staff share and discuss the review of macroeconomic
developments and country pages. IMF staff share policy notes and analytical background notes
related to Article IV consultation missions.



Financial sector reform and FSAP. The World Bank and the IMF teams have worked closely
together while undertaking the 2010 FSAP. In line with the FSAP recommendations, technical
assistance missions are now ongoing and close coordination between the IMF and the World
Bank continues.



Public financial management and tax and customs administration reform. Both institutions
are working to strengthen coordination of work on public financial management including tax
and customs administration reform. Both teams share as much as possible the work done in this
area. Both teams also worked closely together on customs modernization and reform.



Article IV consultations. IMF Article IV consultations regularly share their macroeconomic data
with the World Bank and hold working sessions to try and reconcile macroeconomic data sets.
The collaboration is closest on the debt sustainability analysis, a joint product, but extends more
broadly into other areas of the consultation as well. World Bank staff are also invited to and do
participate in some of the key meetings. The IMF also participated in some of the WB TA
missions on contingent liabilities. Both institutions are considering using the TA mission findings
to further strengthen the DSA analysis.



Structural reforms. The IMF staff and the World Bank teams have worked together to share
views on a range of other issues, including structural reforms for improving investment climate,
economic diversification, customs modernization, and rural development.

Based on the above partnership, the World Bank and the IMF share a common view about
Cambodia’s macroeconomic and structural reform priorities. These include:


4

Sustaining growth. Economic activity remains strong despite some moderation in recent
months and the outlook remains broadly positive but is subject to some downside risks,

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CAMBODIA

including prolonged political stalemate. Sustaining growth would require appropriate fiscal
consolidation and prudent management of the banking sector risks. Improving the business
climate, reducing infrastructure and skills bottlenecks, promoting private sector development
and economic diversification, improving governance and the delivery of public services and
supporting rural development continue to be essential to promote self-sustaining and inclusive
growth.


Managing public finances and debt. Fiscal policy remains the main instrument for
macroeconomic management given high dollarization. Prudent fiscal management is, therefore,
critical and needs to be underpinned by improved revenue collection, prioritized spending, and
better monitoring of contingent liabilities, including through the budgetary and public debt
management framework and further progress in budgetary transparency.



Safeguarding financial system stability and improving the effectiveness of monetary
policy. Implementing the key recommendations of the 2010 FSAP remains critical to
safeguarding financial stability. These include implementing a moratorium on new bank licenses,
strengthening coordinated supervision, developing the foreign exchange market, and improving
the supervisory capacity. Financial stability risks from the buoyant real estate markets need to be
managed through strengthened supervision and improved data collection. Developing an
interbank market remains a necessary step for a transition to more effective and market based
monetary policy operations.



Improving governance. Both the World Bank and IMF have stressed the critical role of
governance in improving the quality of service delivery and fostering private sector
development, which is the engine of growth.

The teams are committed to continue the close cooperation going forward. The table below
details the specific activities planned by the two country teams over the next 12-month period along
with their expected deliveries.

RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
(October 2013)
From 1992 through September 2013, the Asian Development Bank (AsDB) approved funding of
US$1,827.97 million including 70 loan projects and programs of US$1,572.26 million with low
interest, and 21 Asian Development Fund (ADF) grants of US$255.71 million to Cambodia for
structural reform programs and development projects. To date, 46 loan projects for a total of
US$964.94 million and 10 ADF grants of US$85.51 million have been completed.
The sector composition of the active loan/grant portfolio of US$ 819.92 as of September 2013 is:
(i) agriculture and natural resources, US$245.5 million; (ii) education, US$81.6 million; (iii) energy,
US$65.0 million; (iv) finance, US$15.0; (v) health, nutrition, and social protection, US$10.0 million;
(vi) industry and trade, US$11.0 million; (vii) multi-sector (flood reconstruction), US$55.0 million;
(viii) public sector management, US$78.56 million; (ix) transport and communication,
US$200.26 million; and (x) water supply, sanitation, and waste management, US$28.0 million.
ADB Cambodia Country Partnership Strategy (CPS), 2011–2013, endorsed by the Board on 5 July
2011, supports the Government’s development priorities and is aligned closely with the core
operational areas and drivers of change of ADB’s Strategy 2020. It aims to reduce poverty through
projects and programs to promote inclusive economic growth and social development and equity.
The CPS continues a geographical focus on the Tonle Sap Basin, one of the poorest, most
environmentally sensitive regions of Cambodia, and strengthens integration of Cambodia into the
Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS).
The 2011–2013 CPS focuses on five priority sectors―transport (rural and provincial roads), water
supply, sanitation and urban development, agriculture and natural resources (agriculture
commercialization and irrigation support), education (lower secondary schools and vocational
training), and finance (banking regulation, SME finance, and microfinance), supported by ongoing
activities in public sector management (public financial management, and deconcentration and
decentralization). The program responds to the country challenges of climate change,
decentralization, rural-urban linkages, and regional cooperation. The program also incorporates five
key cross-cutting themes into all activities—private sector development, governance, gender equity,
knowledge solutions, and partnerships.
The 3-year time period for the CPS was determined jointly with the Government to align with
Cambodia’s strategic planning cycle, and has been characterized by Government officials as of great
importance for the evolution of the Cambodian economy. Given this development context and the
relatively short three-year planning horizon, the CPS implements a realistic, focused and aligned
strategy, consistent with emerging government priorities. The CPS supports the Government with
the preparation of the National Strategic Development Plan 2014–2018 through analytical sector
and thematic support. This work will also support the preparation of the CPS 2014–2018, for Board
endorsement in June 2014.

In finance, the AsDB will continue its leading role in the financial sector to: (i) consolidate the
banking sector reforms achieved to date, improve financial infrastructure including the national
clearing system and the credit information center covering both banks and microfinance institutions,
and support the strengthening of supervision capacity of the National Bank of Cambodia including
AML/CFT measures; (ii) expand the insurance business for life insurance; and (iii) facilitate capital
market development for more efficient domestic resource mobilization. The AsDB supports
implementation of the Financial Sector Development Strategy (2011–2020). The CPS also includes
support for government measures to deepen public sector management reform and strengthen
anticorruption measures. For decentralization, the AsDB is supporting policy and capacity
development in the transfer of functions to sub-national administrations, fiscal decentralization
(including public financial management capacity development), and sub-national financing
mechanisms such as the Sub-National Investment Facility. Regarding public financial management,
AsDB has supported budget preparation and execution, financial management, internal control,
procurement, and M&E to improve accountability in public expenditures for selected ministries1 as
well as the public debt management capacity of MEF. AsDB has also supported the external audit
capacity of the National Audit Authority.
In private sector development, the AsDB has assisted the government’s efforts in: (i) promoting
competition in domestic markets through competition policy and law, and regulatory efficiency
through capacity development to institutionalize regulatory impact assessment system in the
government; (ii) supporting trade policy reforms such as through strengthening of institutional and
regulatory framework for effective food safety management systems, and capacity and awareness of
the systems; and (iii) enhancing the environment for public-private partnership and stimulating PPP
opportunities. Assistance has also been provided to help the government improve its
competitiveness at the GMS level through reducing border-related costs and distortions; improving
physical infrastructure; enhancing transport and trade facilitation, including promoting compliance
with SPS standards. Later interventions would be more focused on improving the trade facilitation
and logistical links to the sub-region as systems and procedures become more developed and
integrated.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(November 2013)
Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General. Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance. Extensive technical assistance (TA) has
been provided by the IMF, United Nations Development Programme, Asian Development Bank
(AsDB), and World Bank, as well as by bilateral partners, leading to substantial capacity
improvements. Currently, Cambodia is participating in Statistics Department’s (STA's) project on the
Implementation of the System of National Accounts and International Comparison Program, funded
by the government of Japan. This project will provide TA to build statistical capacity and improve
both national accounts and price statistics. Despite the progress made in improving data statistics,
several shortcomings continue to hamper timely and comprehensive analysis.
National accounts. Despite improvements in recent years, weaknesses remain in the quality and
timeliness of national accounts data. The GDP estimates remain hampered by the lack of
comprehensive and reliable source data, in part due to resource constraints and weak data collection
techniques. Statistics Sweden has been assisting the National Institute of Statistics (NIS) for
improving basic statistics for national accounts compilation. A TA mission that visited Cambodia in
November 2011 assessed the methodologies used to compile national accounts and noted
inconsistencies in GDP estimates in current and constant prices, mainly for the period 2007–2010,
and provided guidance for revising the GDP series. The November 2011 mission also provided
support in developing the quarterly national accounts estimates. A mission to assess the progress in
implementing past TA recommendations is scheduled for February 2014.
Price statistics. The compilation of the consumer price index (CPI) suffers from insufficient coverage.
An updated CPI series was introduced starting in April 2012. Geographic coverage of the series has
been expanded to include Phnom Penh plus five provinces. Statistics Sweden continues to provide
assistance with the household budget survey and the CPI, but the project with Sweden is expected to
end in December 2013. An STA TA mission visited Phnom Penh in April 2012 to assist with improving
the CPI. The authorities indicated a need for assistance with developing a producer price index (PPI),
but no funds have been allocated to support the compilation of PPI.
Government finance statistics (GFS). The Ministry of Finance and Economy began implementing
reforms to the government accounting system and budgetary nomenclature in 2007, based on the
Government Finance Statistics Manual (GFSM) 2001, with the assistance of the IMF. In addition,
several STA missions have assisted with GFS compilation procedures within the GSFM 2001
framework. In 2011, Cambodia agreed to participate in the GFS project funded by the Government
of Japan. As a result, the authorities have benefited from two TA missions in 2012 and 2013 to assist
them in the compilation and implementation of GFS. The later has also worked on establishing a
bridge between the government’s new chart of accounts (COA, approved by the authorities in
February 2013 and the GSFM 2001 classifications so that accounting records can be used as source
data in compiling GFS, with the objective of including the GFS in the new Financial Management
Integration System (FMIS). However, the coverage is limited and focusing on the operations of the
budget only, and is not fully integrating activities related to disbursement of external loans and
grants.

Monetary and financial statistics. The NBC compiles the balance sheet and survey for the central
bank and other depository institutions in accordance with the IMF’s Monetary and Financial Statistics
Manual. Since August 2005, the NBC has reported monthly monetary and financial statistics to STA
using the Standardized Report Forms. The NBC received TA during the FSAP on the compilation of
financial soundness indicators (FSIs). The NBC now compiles monthly core FSIs and shares them with
IMF staff regularly.
External sector statistics. Cambodia is part of the Asian module of the Project on the Improvement
of External Sector Statistics (ESS) in the Asia Pacific Region (funded by the government of Japan
launched in October 2012), which aims to improve the accuracy, availability, comparability, and
timeliness of ESS in the region. The project consists mainly of short-term TA missions in three years.
The first TA mission to Cambodia in April 2013 prepared the foundation to improve and update the
ESS compilation methodology and techniques for implementing the sixth edition of the Balance of
Payments and International Investment Position Manual (BPM6). The NBC has made progress in
improving the compilation system following the 2012 balance of payments TA mission. The most
significant accomplishments include: (i) implementing an updated International Transactions
Reporting System (ITRS) coding list aligned with BPM6 requirements; (ii) reducing the reporting
threshold to US$ 5,000 within the ITRS to improve coverage; and (iii) developing a preliminary
questionnaire for the direct investment (DI) survey. However, further actions are needed in the
following areas: (i) improvement of cooperation and data-sharing between government agencies,
(ii) establishing survey on FDI positions and recording flows, including FDI inflows related to
hydropower projects and off-shore oil exploration; (iii) improvement of compilation techniques of
trade and external debt data; (iii) better data dissemination on NBC’s website. The second TA
mission in November 2013 reviews progress in the implementation of the action plan agreed during
the April 2013 TA mission; and focus on the trial run of the FDI survey, the improvement of data
collection and compilation of goods for processing, travel, transportation and technical assistance,
and further improvement of the ITRS. Additionally, the mission assesses the consistency between ESS
and monetary and financial statistics.
Data Standards and Quality
Cambodia participates in the IMF’s General Data Dissemination System. No data ROSC are available.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation with Cambodia
On January 27, 2014, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the 2013 Article IV consultation1 with Cambodia, and considered and endorsed the staff
appraisal without a meeting.2
Economic activity remained strong in 2013 driven by robust exports, with garment exports
helped by preferential access to European Union, and tourism with more diversified destinations.
Real estate and construction also expanded rapidly supported by fast credit growth. Foreign
direct investment (FDI) remained strong partly driven by factories relocating from China and
Vietnam. Nonetheless, staff estimates real GDP growth to remain at 7 percent in 2013 due to the
sluggish global economic recovery, the recent floods, and the slowdown in economic activity
during the election period.
Private sector credit has been growing by about 30 percent (year-on-year) on average in the last
three years driven mainly by ample liquidity, including bank funding from abroad, and
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually

every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.
2

Article IV consultations are concluded without a Board meeting when the following conditions apply: (i) there are

no acute or significant risks, or general policy issues requiring Board discussion; (ii) policies or circumstances are
unlikely to have significant regional or global impact; (iii) in the event a parallel program review is being completed,
it is also being completed on a lapse-of-time basis; and (iv) the use of Fund resources is not under discussion or
anticipated.

2
heightened competition in the banking system. In the process, the loan-to-deposit (LTD) ratio
trended upwards to over 100 percent and credit-to-GDP ratio nearly doubled to 40 percent
diverging from past trends of sustainable financial deepening. The National Bank of Cambodia
raised the reserve requirements on foreign currency deposits in September 2012 by ½ percentage
points (ppt) to 12½ percent, but bank funding from abroad is not subject to any prudential limits.
Notwithstanding the rapid credit growth, inflationary pressures eased due to moderating
commodity prices. As a result headline inflation is estimated to average around 3 percent in 2013
once the impact of the recent floods on food prices subsides.
The current account deficit including official transfers is expected to stay flat at around
8½ percent of GDP in 2013 owing to strong but moderating imports, and remain fully financed
by FDI and official loans. The deficit is projected to decline to 5½ percent of GDP over the
medium term with improved competitiveness and diversification of exports, and lower imports
after the completion of large power projects. Gross official reserves stood at US$3.6 billion in
November, about 3½ months of prospective imports, and this reserve coverage appears to be
adequate considering the long-term nature of Cambodia’s external debt, although the high degree
of dollarization would suggest that a higher level of reserves may be warranted. Consistent with
this stable external position, the real effective exchange rate has remained stable since the 2008
global financial crisis.
Fiscal consolidation remained broadly on track. Buoyant domestic demand and revenue
collection efforts improved revenue performance, while domestically-funded spending has been
in line with the budget. As a result, the fiscal deficit, excluding grants, is expected to narrow
further by about ½ ppt of GDP in 2013, leaving the stock of government deposits, the only fiscal
buffers, at around 4¾ percent of GDP.
Executive Board Assessment
In concluding the 2013 Article IV consultation with Cambodia, Executive Directors endorsed
staff’s appraisal, as follows:

3
Economic activity remains strong driven by robust exports, tourism, and construction despite
recent floods and some slowdown during the election. Growth is projected to pick up to
7¼ percent in 2014 and reach 7½ percent over the medium term along with global recovery,
improvements in infrastructure, competitiveness, and investment climate. Inflation is expected to
remain low in 2013–14 due to stable food and fuel prices. The external position is stable
notwithstanding a declining reserve coverage of foreign currency deposits, and the real effective
exchange rate appears to be in line with fundamentals.
The U.S. tapering and slow European growth could expose Cambodia’s favorable outlook to
downside risks. On the domestic side, rapid credit growth and emerging risks in a fast changing
financial landscape could undermine financial stability; extreme weather conditions could affect
agriculture and growth, and labor market instability could disrupt garment production and
exports. Should these downside risks materialize, low fiscal buffers would require any additional
expenditure to be allocated to high-impact development spending.
The progress made by the authorities in implementing past Article IV recommendations is
welcome. They have improved revenue collection, formulated a revenue mobilization strategy
(RMS), and strengthened public financial management (PFM), including improving the
monitoring of contingent liabilities. They have also introduced negotiable certificates of deposit
(NCDs) to help develop the interbank market, improved financial supervisory capacity, and
established an initial memorandum of understanding (MoU) to establish a financial crisis
management framework. Continuous progress in many of these areas remains necessary and is
reflected in the priorities of this Article IV consultation.
The strong fiscal performance has continued, driven by substantial improvement in revenue
collection and prudent spending. Fiscal consolidation should continue to rebuild government
deposits―the only fiscal buffers―in view of the expected decline in grants, to maintain longterm fiscal and debt sustainability, including by making the planned wage increases in 2014 a
part of a broader civil service reform. Successful implementation of RMS strategy and careful
management of contingent liabilities are needed to rebuild and safeguard the fiscal space.
Continuing with PFM reforms remains important to improve fiscal accountability and
transparency.

4

Rapid credit growth, increasing foreign bank financing and the buoyancy of the real estate and
construction sectors pose substantial macro financial risks especially in light of high
dollarization, which limits monetary policy effectiveness and lender-of-last-resort capacity. Steps
on multiple fronts are required to contain credit growth and safeguard financial stability.
Strengthening liquidity supervision and redefining the liquid asset ratio (LAR) to better capture
banks’ true liquidity conditions will improve their resilience to shocks. Fully enforcing the
reserve requirements to include foreign funds in the reserve base would help contain credit
growth. Should this fail to slow credit growth macro prudential measures such as loan-to-value
ratios (LTVs) and LTDs could be considered. Better monitoring of real estate developments, by
collecting more data including on developer financing, is also needed to contain risks. Finally,
the introduction of NCDs is a welcome first step toward market-based monetary operations.
Going forward establishing an interbank and foreign exchange market would be needed to begin
addressing dollarization, including by allowing more exchange rate flexibility.
The transition to risk-based supervision and the rapid expansion of the banking system continued
to put additional burden on the supervisory capacity, and in this context, the 2010 FSAP
recommendation of imposing a moratorium on new bank licenses remains appropriate. In view
of the limited resources, focusing on key emerging risks would improve the supervisory
effectiveness. Strengthening the financial crisis management framework is critical in managing
systemic risks and minimizing potential fiscal costs. The signing of an initial MoU between
supervisory agencies is welcome, and should be used to enhance cooperation at the policy and
technical levels, and expedite preparation of a second MoU on crisis resolution.
Cambodia has made good progress in achieving the Millennium Development Goals and reduced
poverty substantially. Continued improvements in human capital, including through education
and training, infrastructure, and business climate are needed to promote inclusive and sustainable
growth and further reduce poverty and income inequality. Plans to reduce regulatory
impediments to doing business are welcome, while improving education outcomes to catch up
with peers would take longer term efforts. Given the budgetary constraints, the near term priority
would be improving efficiency and reallocating spending within the budget envelope. New

5
initiatives, such as establishing a national training fund, could be considered over the medium
term following the successful implementation of PFM reforms.
Good faith efforts to resolve external arrears are welcome and should continue.
