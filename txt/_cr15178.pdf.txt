IMF Executive Board Concludes 2015 Article IV Consultation with France
On July 8, 2015, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation1 with France.
A solid recovery is underway. The economy is expected to expand by 1.2 percent this year,
supported by an accommodative external environment. Sharply lower oil prices, a depreciated
euro, low interest rates on account of quantitative easing (QE), and the recovery in other euro
area countries should underpin household consumption, lift export growth, and eventually foster
a rebound in investment. Combined with a slowdown in fiscal consolidation, this should allow
the output gap to narrow gradually, although unemployment is projected to decline only slowly.
After falling to near zero, inflation is set to accelerate this year as euro depreciation and QE feed
more fully into prices, and the effect of the oil price decline wears off. Short-term risks are
evenly balanced, depending in part on the strength of the euro area recovery.
Structural rigidities continue to weigh on medium-term prospects. Potential output growth is
fundamentally weaker than before the crisis, reflecting lower productivity growth and crisis
legacies. Rising government spending has pushed up public debt and the tax burden. An
extended period of solid wage growth despite declining productivity growth has eroded
competitiveness, shrunk profit margins, and reduced firms’ capacity to invest and innovate.
Labor market rigidities are hampering job creation and feeding high structural unemployment.
Longstanding bottlenecks, including extensive regulation and barriers to competition in services,
are hindering innovation, investment, and productivity growth. These rigidities could come to
undermine medium-term growth, especially if reform implementation falters or external shocks
materialize, such as lower growth in advanced countries or financial market volatility.
To address these medium-term challenges, the authorities have embarked on a range of reforms
to raise economic growth, reduce unemployment, and consolidate the fiscal position. The Pacte
de Responsabilité et de Solidarité and the CICE tax credit have reduced the labor tax wedge

substantially. The Macron and Rebsamen laws are intended to liberalize services and improve
the functioning of the labor market. The fiscal strategy, set out in the current multi-year budget
law and the 2015 Stability Program, aims to bring the headline deficit below 3 percent of GDP
by 2017, with a gradual adjustment based exclusively on spending containment.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors welcomed France’s recovery which, supported by an improved external
environment, appears to be gathering momentum. Directors noted, however, that the need for
further fiscal adjustment calls for a delicate balancing act in the period ahead and entrenched
structural rigidities in the labor and product markets continue to restrain medium-term prospects.
Accordingly, they encouraged the authorities to persevere with their efforts to rein in public
spending, revive job creation, and remove bottlenecks to growth.
Directors commended the authorities for switching the focus of fiscal consolidation to
expenditure measures. They considered that the pace of fiscal adjustment should be ambitious
enough to safely achieve the medium-term fiscal targets, including a firmly declining path for the
debt ratio, without unduly detracting from the recovery. Directors recommended that the
adjustment be underpinned by structural measures, identified through comprehensive
expenditure reviews at all levels of government.
Directors underscored the need for broad-based labor market reforms to return to pre-crisis rates
of job creation. They welcomed progress in narrowing the labor tax wedge, recent measures to
reduce legal uncertainty concerning dismissals, and plans to improve the social dialogue. To
reduce unemployment more rapidly, Directors recommended allowing more flexibility in firm
level agreements on hours and wages, reforming the minimum wage, and strengthening job
search incentives for those receiving unemployment or welfare benefits.
Directors encouraged the authorities to maintain the momentum on product market reform. In
particular, they agreed that further liberalizing regulated professions, dismantling bureaucratic
hurdles to small enterprises, and removing barriers to competition in services will raise
productivity and boost potential growth.
Directors noted that, while France’s banks are reasonably well placed to adapt to the Banking
Union, the low interest rate environment may put pressure on margins for both banks and
insurance companies. They stressed the need for close monitoring of financial risks and
continued strengthening of bank capital and liquidity buffers in line with evolving regulatory

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
June 23, 2015

KEY ISSUES
Context. After several years of near-stagnation, France’s economy is recovering, supported by
an accommodative external environment, in particular lower oil prices, a depreciated euro, and
low interest rates. However, structural rigidities continue to weigh on France’s medium-term
growth potential, estimated to average just 1.2 percent, despite steady labor force growth.
Policies. The fiscal strategy has rightly shifted to expenditure-based consolidation, but nominal
spending containment has not yielded the intended savings in a low growth and inflation
environment. Important progress has recently been made on structural reforms, notably by
reducing the labor tax wedge and advancing on supply-side reforms. Further efforts are needed
to address high unemployment, growth bottlenecks, and record-high public spending.
Spending-based fiscal consolidation. To ensure that medium-term fiscal objectives are met,
general government primary spending should be kept flat in real terms, starting in 2016. This
would deliver structural adjustment of ½ percent of GDP per year, and place public debt on a
downward trajectory by 2017. Spending containment should shift to higher quality structural
measures based on broad-based expenditure reviews at all levels of government—notably
staffing reform, institutional streamlining and tighter budget constraints for local governments,
better targeting of social benefits, and a further increase in the effective retirement age.
Combating unemployment. Building on recent reforms, broad-based efforts are needed to
reduce the high level of structural unemployment and accelerate job creation. Flexibility for
social partners to agree at firm level on hours and wages should be expanded. Annual increases
in the minimum wage should be limited to inflation as long as unemployment remains high. Job
search incentives should be strengthened for recipients of unemployment and welfare benefits.
Education and training resources should be better targeted to the youth and the unemployed.
Removing growth bottlenecks. The recent momentum on product market reforms should be
maintained. Further removing barriers to competition in services would help provide better
incentives for innovation and productivity growth. Disincentives for firms to grow beyond
certain employee thresholds should be reduced and the process for cutting red tape be made
more effective. Further efforts are also needed to alleviate constraints on the supply of
affordable housing.
Financial sector. The financial sector should continue to adapt to a changing macroeconomic
and regulatory environment. The guaranteed interest rates on regulated savings deposits should
be reduced, and tax incentives for savings and insurance products reviewed.

CONTEXT–LATE RECOVERY AND FISCAL SLIPPAGES
1.
Reform efforts. France has struggled to bring its fiscal deficit in line with the targets under
the Stability and Growth Pact and accelerate structural reforms. The government has recently
pushed ahead with a number of supply-side reform initiatives against some resistance in parliament.
In April 2015, it presented a multi-year economic strategy in the Stability Program and National
Reform Program, which centers on gradual fiscal adjustment and broad-based economic reforms.
Notwithstanding political and economic setbacks, the government has vowed to continue its
economic reform course.
2.
Late recovery. While the French economy showed some resilience during the crisis years,
the recovery lagged behind other euro area economies, with only 0.2 percent growth in 2014
(Figures 1 and 2). Investment and net exports both declined in real terms while high levels of
unemployment and inactivity remained a drag on consumer demand. Consumption and export
growth began accelerating in late 2014 and early 2015, but corporate investment remained weak
and residential construction depressed. Unemployment continued to climb, reaching 10.5 percent in
April 2015.

3.
Disinflation. Inflation slowed sharply in 2014 and early 2015 on flagging core inflation
(0.6 percent year-on-year in April), energy deflation, and slower food price growth. Unused
production capacities, high unemployment, and the pass through of lower import prices all
restrained inflationary pressures.
4.
Weak competitiveness and external imbalances. France’s share in world export markets
has declined substantially over the past decade (Figure 3), while robust domestic demand
throughout the crisis has sustained import growth. The current account deficit declined modestly
in 2014, but remained one to three percent of GDP weaker than its cyclically-adjusted norm, and the
real exchange rate was five to ten percent overvalued according to staff estimates (Appendix V).
Competitiveness has been impaired by a prolonged period during which real wage growth remained

solid despite declining productivity growth. This has squeezed profit margins and reduced firms’
capacity to invest and innovate, with regulatory disincentives for SME growth and a rising tax
burden adding to the competitiveness gap. While the recent euro depreciation and fall in oil prices
are expected to narrow the current account deficit (Figure 4), some of the underlying causes of the
external imbalance remain, in particular elevated unit labor costs and a sizeable fiscal deficit.
5.
Fiscal slippages. In early 2012, the authorities set out to bring the structural deficit to
balance by 2016, with adjustment equally divided between revenue and expenditure measures. Tax
increases were frontloaded and expenditure containment began in 2013. The structural deficit was
reduced by about two percentage points of GDP in 2012–13. But the strategy ran into difficulties
in 2014 when nominal spending containment efforts did not yield the envisaged savings in the
context of low growth and inflation. As a result, fiscal consolidation fell short of the authorities’
target, with the headline deficit broadly unchanged at 4 percent of GDP and expenditure and debt
ratios continuing to climb.
6.
Financial sector stable. The banking system’s capital and liquidity ratios have been
strengthened, and the maturity structure of funding has been lengthened, although banks remain
dependent on wholesale funding (Figure 5). The largest four banks have raised Core Equity
Tier 1 (CET1) ratios to above 10 percent (fully loaded Basel III basis) and all meet the 100 percent
Liquidity Coverage Ratio. The NPL ratio has declined to 4 percent. The ECB’s 2014 Comprehensive
Assessment did not result in any banks needing to raise additional capital. In the asset quality
review, valuation adjustments to risk-weighted assets were less than 0.5 percent, the second lowest
among euro area countries, and the stress test reduced the CET1 ratio by around 3 percentage
points, less than for most other countries. However, leverage ratios remain comparatively low in
some banks. Risks to private balance sheets appear limited, with corporate indebtedness
at 66 percent of GDP, adjusted for intercompany loans, and household debt at 55 percent of GDP.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
A. Brighter Short-Term Prospects
7.
Solid short-term recovery ahead. We
project real GDP growth at 1.2 percent in 2015 and
1.5 percent in 2016, supported by improved
consumer confidence and a highly accommodative
external environment. Sharply lower oil prices will
underpin households’ consumption while a
depreciated euro and the euro area recovery
should lift export growth. Very low interest rates on
account of Quantitative Easing (QE) are projected
to filter gradually into higher investment
(Appendix I quantifies these shocks). Credit growth
is expected to pick up alongside rising demand.

Yet headwinds remain. Unemployment is still high and rising, notwithstanding recent cuts in the
labor tax wedge under the CICE and Responsibility Pact.1 Residential construction remains
depressed, and fiscal consolidation, while slower, will continue to dampen near-term growth.
8.
Inflation to pick up this year. Lower energy prices and slowing wage growth (including a
below average increase in the minimum wage) are projected to reduce annual average inflation to
0.1 percent in 2015, and core inflation to 0.5 percent. Inflation is set to accelerate this year, and rise
to 1.0 percent in 2016 as the output gap starts to narrow, the impact of the oil price decline on
headline inflation wanes, and the price effects from euro depreciation and QE are felt more fully.
9.
Output gap to narrow gradually. The more accommodative macroeconomic policy mix on
account of QE, a depreciated euro, and slower fiscal consolidation is projected to support aggregate
demand over the coming years. Together with recent and planned structural reforms,2 this more
favorable environment should improve economic confidence and filter into a solid rebound in
corporate investment, a stabilization and eventual recovery of the housing sector, and further
strengthening of private consumption. Export growth is expected to be more dynamic alongside
rising global demand and the recovery in the euro area. Under baseline assumptions, this should
allow for a gradual narrowing of the output gap and a return of inflation to more normal rates.
10.
Short-term risks evenly balanced. Growth may turn out stronger than projected in the
short term, in particular if QE and improved confidence in the euro area were to filter more quickly
into investment and export gains. However, the recovery could be adversely affected by potential
confidence losses (e.g., in the event of adverse geopolitical or Greece-related developments), a
rebound in energy prices, or a surge in financial volatility.

B. Structural Rigidities Weighing on Medium-Term Prospects
11.
Growth potential fundamentally weaker
than before crisis. Potential output growth has
declined sharply, from an average of 2.2 percent
in 1981–99, to 1.8 percent in 2000−08, to around
1.1 percent now (Box 1). While some of the decline
may reflect lower total factor productivity (TFP)
growth from information technology, crisis legacies
and structural rigidities appear to have left their
mark. Rising government spending has pushed up
public debt. Labor market rigidities are hampering
job creation, with unemployment projected to

The Crédit d’Impôt pour la Compétitivité et l’Emploi (CICE) is a corporate tax credit applying to six percent of the
wage bill of employees earning up to 2½ times minimum wage. The Responsibility Pact (Pacte de Responsabilité et de
Solidarité) reduces employer’s social security contributions for wages up to 3.5 times to the minimum wage.

These reforms are estimated to raise real GDP growth by an average of ½ percent over the next five years (Table 7).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

FRANCE

remain high throughout the forecast period. Heavy regulation, barriers to competition in services,
wage inertia, and a rising tax burden have squeezed profit margins, thereby inhibiting innovation,
weakening competitiveness, and aggravating the impact of the prolonged pause of investment
growth during the crisis. Looking ahead, potential output in 2020 is projected to be eight percent
lower than on pre-crisis trends (chart). In short, France’s traditional growth model—with domestic
demand supported by government spending, robust real wage dynamics, and a steady labor force
growth—appears at risk.
12.
Significant downside risks over the medium term. While accommodative external
conditions and robust domestic demand are projected to underpin growth under baseline
assumptions, there is a risk that the recovery may eventually fizzle out, and that France may face a
protracted period of sluggish growth, low inflation, and persistently high unemployment. Such a
scenario would significantly affect public debt dynamics, which are particularly vulnerable to growth
shocks (Debt Sustainability Analysis, Appendix III). Key risk factors include (Appendix IV):


Less accommodative external environment. A protracted period of stagnation in advanced
countries would have a significant impact on exports and may spill over into investment
dynamics. A sustained increase in commodity prices could further dampen domestic demand.



Insufficient reform progress. If political resolve for structural reform implementation were to
wane, growth could suffer as structural rigidities would constrain both supply and demand.



Financial volatility. A protracted period of financial volatility—e.g., from, reassessment of global
risk, market uncertainty around unconventional monetary policies, or renewed bond market
stress in the euro area—would likely have only limited direct impact on France. However,
France’s banks remain vulnerable to a globally systemic closure in funding markets, given their
reliance on wholesale funding. The low interest rate environment could lead to a gradual buildup of financial sector risks as a result of weakening profitability of banks and insurers or
increased risk-taking in the search-for-yield.

13.
Spillovers. The above risks can in turn create outward spillovers. A protracted period of
economic stagnation in France could have an adverse effect on euro area partners, both directly on
aggregate demand and indirectly via confidence effects. Failure to deliver on fiscal consolidation
and structural reform commitments could be seen as weakening the credibility of EU economic
governance. Given their size and interconnectedness, French banks could create adverse effects if
forced into further retrenchment from corporate lending and investment banking or from retail
operations abroad (e.g., Italy, emerging Europe).
14.
Views of the authorities. The authorities noted that staff’s baseline projections are broadly
in line with theirs. They concurred that the recovery was supported by favorable external
developments, but also noted that recent reforms have likely played a role in building domestic
confidence. They saw the balance of near-term risks as tilted to the upside. The authorities agreed
that potential growth and employment creation are still weaker than before the crisis, but
considered that their reform program will help in this respect.

Box 1. Potential Output in France
1

Estimating potential output is particularly relevant at the current juncture. Potential output plays
an important role in assessing fiscal effort and projecting future growth, inflation, unemployment, and
debt dynamics. Following significant revisions in
recent years, IMF staff has sought to improve the
consistency and robustness of its estimates by
using a multivariate filter approach that
incorporates empirical relationships between
actual and potential GDP, unemployment, and
inflation. This filter has been applied to assess
potential output in the global economy (2015 April
WEO) and to estimate potential output separately
for four large euro area countries (France,
Germany, Italy, Spain).

Potential growth has declined significantly since the early 2000s, driven initially by a sustained
decline in TFP and thereafter by crisis legacies. The drop in TFP growth, mirrored in many other
advanced countries, may be related to lower growth returns from ICT (Fernald 2014a, 2014b; April 2015
WEO), and, to a lesser extent, the switch from manufacturing to services (van Ark and others, 2007;
Dabla-Norris, 2015, Molagoda and Perez, 2011). In France, this decline was initially partly offset by
higher potential employment growth related to dynamic labor force growth. During the crisis years,
potential growth collapsed to less than 1 percent, reflecting a prolonged slowdown in investment and
a rise in structural unemployment.
Looking ahead, France’s potential growth appears much weaker than before the crisis. Under
current policies, including recent and planned
reforms, potential growth should increase over the
medium term, but average only about 1.2 percent
over 2015–20, despite France’s comparatively

Potential output is conventionally defined as the level of output—based on full utilization of available labor, capital and
technological resources—that is consistent with stable inflation (Okun, 1962). The output gap is the difference between actual
and potential GDP. A related concept is the NAIRU, which measures the rate of unemployment consistent with stable inflation.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
15.
With a recovery finally underway, attention is shifting to the structural rigidities that
weigh on medium-term prospects. The present accommodative macroeconomic environment
provides an opportunity to push ahead with the more difficult policies and reforms to address
France’s more fundamental economic problems. Rising government spending, which had supported
aggregate demand before and during the crisis, has pushed up public debt and the tax burden, and
makes fiscal adjustment a difficult balancing act. The persistence of high structural unemployment
risks creating longer-term social problems while also limiting France’s potential growth. A range of
long-standing structural bottlenecks, including overregulation and barriers to competition, are
hampering innovation, investment, and productivity growth.
16.
The authorities have embarked on a range of welcome reforms, though further efforts
are needed to lay the foundations for sustainable growth (Box 2). The 2015 National Reform
Program and Stability Program set out a broad strategy to raise economic growth, reduce
unemployment, and gradually consolidate the fiscal position via spending containment. Following
the substantial cuts in the labor tax wedge under the Responsibility Pact and CICE, the government
is pushing ahead with additional reform initiatives. The Macron law—now at a final stage of
parliamentary approval following use of a special constitutional procedure to overcome political
resistance—contains supply-side reforms to liberalize parts of the economy while also advancing
some labor reforms. The draft Rebsamen law, expected to be adopted by year end, is intended to
improve the social dialogue and ease labor-related regulations that hamper SME growth. While
significant, these efforts are likely not enough to lift potential growth closer to pre-crisis levels and
ensure that fiscal objectives are achieved with adequate margins. To this end, staff focused its
recommendations on the need to underpin fiscal consolidation through deep spending reform,
push ahead with broad-based reforms to foster employment creation, while maintaining the recent
momentum on product market reforms.

A. Fundamental Spending Reform to Underpin Fiscal Sustainability
17.
High and rising government spending has been at the core of France’s fiscal problems
(Selected Issues Chapter I). After more than two decades of steady growth, general government
expenditures reached a record high in 2014, at over 57½ percent of GDP—about 12 percentage
points above the average of the other euro area countries. This growth was driven primarily by
social security and local government spending, which expanded on average one percentage point
per year faster than GDP, while the central government spending has been growing on par with
GDP. As a result of the persistent spending pressures, revenues had to be raised successively, and
France’s tax burden is now about ten percentage points of GDP above the euro area average,
constraining the growth potential of the private sector (Figure 6). Moreover, with a persistent
structural deficit, public debt has ballooned to 95½ percent of GDP in 2014, from 21 percent of GDP
in 1980.

18.
The fiscal strategy has rightly shifted to expenditure-based consolidation, but the
planned pace of adjustment leaves little room for maneuver. Reliance on nominal containment
measures—such as public service wage-scale freezes and temporary under-indexation of pensions
and certain social benefits—did not deliver the adjustment envisaged in last year’s Stability Program,
as growth and inflation came in below projections.3 In light of these slippages, the European Council
granted France two additional years, until 2017, to bring its headline deficit below the EDP
threshold, allowing for a more gradual adjustment path. The fiscal strategy outlined in this year’s
Stability Program, which includes additional spending reductions of 0.2 percent of GDP for
both 2015 and 2016, would bring the headline deficit narrowly below 3 percent of GDP in 2017
under baseline assumptions. While the 2015 deficit objective appears on track to be met, there is a
risk that medium-term targets will be missed in the event that growth or inflation fall short, or
additional spending needs arise.

Staff recommended keeping spending flat in real terms, starting with the 2016
budget. A fiscal anchor that ensures that primary general government expenditure grows in line
with inflation, supported by a burden sharing mechanism, would deliver structural adjustment of
about ½ percent of GDP per year, striking an appropriate balance between anchoring debt
sustainability and smoothing the impact on demand. It would provide a safety margin to ensure that
the headline deficit is reduced to below 3 percent of GDP by 2017 and debt is placed on a firm
downward trajectory. It would also help ensure that structural fiscal balance is achieved within the
next five years, which would create fiscal space for tax alleviation in the order of ½ percent of GDP
per year starting around 2020. To this end, staff recommended clarifying the structural measures
underpinning the already announced spending package and identifying additional savings. In the
short term, this could include further tightening the budget constraint for local governments, steps
3

Nominal spending growth was contained at 1.6 percent in 2014 (almost half of which was due to rising tax credits).
With nominal GDP growth coming in at only 0.8 percent, this resulted in a further rise of the spending-GDP ratio.
Similarly, with a lower-than-projected nominal GDP path in 2015 and beyond, both spending and headline deficits
are projected to exceed the targets set in early 2014 (see text chart).

Fiscal adjustment should rely on deeper reforms that can underpin a lasting reduction
in government spending (Selected Issues Chapter I). Building on recent efforts, regular broadbased expenditure reviews should be employed to assess the efficiency and quality of expenditure
at all levels of government and prepare for deeper structural reforms, including:


Streamlining local government positions and institutions, supported by further cuts in transfers,
tighter caps on local borrowing and taxes, and elimination of the universal competency clause
that allows local governments to spend in all areas;



Reversing the growth in public employment based on reviews of staffing at all levels of
government;



Improving the targeting and efficiency of social benefits, including for unemployment, welfare,
families, and housing allowances; and



Reforming pension benefits, by raising the effective retirement age, streamlining special pension
regimes, and ensuring the financial sustainability of supplementary pensions.

21.
Views of the authorities. The authorities confirmed that fiscal consolidation will be fully
expenditure-based going forward, and emphasized the spending containment efforts since last year.
On the pace of adjustment, they considered that the multi-year strategy outlined in this year’s
Stability Program provides adequate margins to meet medium-term targets, in particular as

macroeconomic assumptions are prudent. They confirmed that any windfall would be used to
reduce debt. The authorities concurred with staff on the need to reduce the expenditure-to-GDP
ratio, ultimately bringing it closer to the euro area average. They agreed on the need for structural
reforms to contain local spending, control the wage bill, and improve the targeting of social security
programs. While horizontal nominal spending measures remain necessary in the near term, the 2016
budget will also include structural measures. The authorities noted that containing spending at the
local level is challenging given the constitutionally guaranteed fiscal autonomy of sub-national
governments, but progressive cuts in transfers from the state combined with the recent creation of
an indicative spending target (ODEDEL) should help.

B. Combating Unemployment
22.
High unemployment is becoming entrenched in a segmented labor market. Sluggish
demand during the crisis years, coupled with labor market and wage rigidities, has pushed
unemployment to 10.5 percent as of April 2015, from 7.5 percent in 2008 (Figure 7). Despite a
relatively robust labor force growth, net job creation has stagnated since 2008. Employment rates
remain relatively low, and inactivity rates of the

Building on recent efforts, broad-based reforms are needed to return to pre-crisis
rates of job creation (Selected Issues Chapter II). With a steadily rising labor force and moderate
medium-term growth prospects, removing barriers to employment growth will be critical to
reversing the rise in structural unemployment. Important steps have been taken in recent years, in
particular through: the reduction of the tax wedge under the Responsibility Pact and CICE tax credit;
the 2013 agreements to enhance social partners’ flexibility at the enterprise level and ease collective
dismissals; the planned reform of the prud’hommes system under the Macron law to reduce judicial
uncertainties on individual dismissals; and the draft Rebsamen law would streamline the mandatory
discussions between social partners in SMEs. However, given remaining labor market rigidities, the
unemployment rate is likely to decline only slowly, and there is a risk that recent labor tax cuts feed

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

FRANCE

into wages as unemployment declines. Achieving a faster and deeper reduction in unemployment
would require a broad-based reform approach that rests on four pillars:4


Enterprise-level agreements. The ability of enterprises to adjust hours and wages to changing
economic circumstances remains very constrained.5 Recent reforms were aimed at introducing
more flexibility for enterprises in economic difficulties through “job preservation agreements”.
These agreements have been rarely used, however, in part because of restrictive conditions. Staff
recommended enhancing the flexibility of social partners to agree on hours and wages in all
enterprises.



Minimum wage. While intended to ensure a basic living wage, France’s minimum wage level is
one of the highest in the euro area, hampering the employability of the young and of the lowskilled. Moreover, annual minimum wage increases, partially indexed to the average real wage in
the economy, set a floor for pay settlements downstream, thus creating a feedback loop that
contributes to wage rigidity. To better balance its social role against unemployment effects, staff
recommended limiting minimum wage increases to inflation for as long as unemployment
remains high.



Benefits. France’s benefits system is comparatively generous. Staff recommended harmonizing
and strengthening job search incentives of unemployment and social welfare benefit recipients,
including through gradual reductions in benefits if reasonable job offers are refused. In addition,
job search incentives could be strengthened for unemployment benefits by lengthening the
period of work that is required for eligibility, and by introducing degressivity of benefits.



Education and training. Each year, 140,000 young people leave the education system without
completing school. Spending on professional training amounts to about 1.4 percent of GDP, but
primarily benefits skilled workers and those in large companies. Staff emphasized the need for
better targeting resources on quality training for the young, the low-skilled, and unemployed.

24.
Views of the authorities. Reducing unemployment remains the government’s central
objective, with structural reform efforts increasingly focusing on the labor market. The authorities
estimate that the Responsibility Pact and CICE will create around half a million jobs. The authorities
noted that the Macron law would also facilitate the use of job preservation agreements, and that
they have set up a working group to recommend further steps for increasing company-level
flexibility. Regarding the minimum wage, they emphasized its social role while noting that recent
reductions in the tax wedge have already lowered the effective cost of labor at lower salary ranges.
4

A number of studies point to the need for a multi-pronged strategy, with varying assessments of the importance of
individual labor market reforms. Staff estimates that each of the four main reform areas discussed here would reduce
the NAIRU by at least ½ percentage point in the long term. A comprehensive package, including further tax wedge
cuts once fiscal space allows, could yield a four percentage point reduction of the long-term NAIRU, and raise
potential output by five percentage points cumulatively by 2030.
5

Firm-level labor agreements must improve upon industry-level agreements and labor code. Extension procedures
achieve a wide coverage of industry agreements, notwithstanding limited union density.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

FRANCE

Regarding benefits, an ongoing review of the unemployment insurance system will inform future
reforms to be negotiated by social partners; the employment agency is exploring ways to enforce
job search requirements; and the draft Rebsamen law would merge the two supplementary income
support programs for the working poor. On professional training, the authorities highlighted that
the recent introduction of portable training will encourage labor mobility. The government is also
exploring options for promoting apprenticeships and better targeting training resources. In early
June, the government announced additional measures to promote employment, particularly in
SMEs, including by increasing the number of allowed renewals for fixed-term contracts, easing
threshold effects for small firms, subsidizing micro enterprises recruiting their first employee, and
extending the trial period of apprenticeships.

C. Removing Growth Bottlenecks
25.
Barriers to competition in services and extensive regulation remain important
obstacles to growth (Selected Issues Chapter III). Productivity growth in services has been slow in
recent years. As in other European countries, this partly reflects crisis legacies, but also barriers to
competition, which limit the development of startups and weaken incentives to innovate and
improve quality (Figure 8). This raises the cost of services and filters into the rest of the economy—
staff has estimated that a 1 percent productivity gain in regulated services could raise GDP by
0.8 percent after two years. Extensive regulatory requirements on businesses, especially above
certain employee thresholds, further limit incentives for investment. Together with a heavy tax
burden and labor market rigidities, these factors are a significant drag on France’s competitiveness
and growth potential.
26.
The recent momentum on product market reform should be maintained.6 The Macron
law contains a number of supply-side reforms, including steps to liberalize opening hours, enhance
competition in regulated legal professions, reduce rents received by toll road operators, and open
up intercity bus transport. It also expands the competencies of the Competition Authority, notably
regarding some barriers to entry affecting retail and regulated legal professions. These reforms
complement the ongoing simplification of administrative burden process, with support from the
Business Simplification Council. Staff welcomed these steps, while underscoring the significant
remaining potential for productivity gains from enhanced competition in services and reduction of
red tape (see some specific recommendations in Box 2).
27.
More could be done to alleviate structural rigidities in the housing market. Residential
construction has fallen by 14 percent, and real house prices by 11 percent, since the peak in 2007.
While this decline is partly cyclical, a succession of laws introducing regulatory and tax changes may
also have contributed. Another long-standing factor affecting the market is the extensive system of
housing subsidies, which include rental cash assistance (received by 44 percent of tenants),
subsidized mortgage rates for households, and fiscal breaks for providers (including of social
6

The OECD has estimated that structural reforms undertaken since 2012 (including labor tax cuts and the Macron
law) would jointly raise GDP growth by 0.3 percent per year. See reference in Selected Issues Chapter III.

FRANCE

housing), together amounting to 1.9 percent of GDP in 2013. While these were aimed at making
housing more affordable, studies have found that rental assistance may contribute to rising rents.
Staff recommended reviewing the functioning of the housing market, with a view to alleviating
constraints on the supply of affordable housing and improving the targeting of benefits.
28.
Views of the authorities. The authorities were confident that ongoing product market
reforms will foster competition and growth. The government recently announced measures to
support employment creation in SMEs, including by alleviating administrative and tax requirements,
and labor constraints. They also highlighted the recent introduction of temporarily more favorable
amortization rules, which should provide a near-term boost to investment. There are plans to reform
qualification requirements that act as barriers to entry into certain professions. The authorities also
reiterated the importance of seed money from the state to foster innovation and steer the economy
toward sectors with growth potential. On housing, they considered that recent measures to increase
supply—such as simplifying regulations and increasing availability of land, including in areas with
especially high demand—are starting to bear fruit. They also noted that certain rental assistance
benefits are under scrutiny as part of efforts to contain expenditure.

D. Adapting the Financial Sector
29.
The low interest rate environment could lead to a gradual build-up of risks in the
financial sector (Selected Issues Chapter IV). While QE is supporting the recovery, a prolonged
period of very low interest rates could create vulnerabilities resulting from a narrowing of financial
sector profit margins, asset price inflation, and private debt accumulation.


Banks. With interest rates at very low levels, banks are facing a squeeze on interest margins,
especially due to a sharp increase in mortgage refinancing. An aggravating factor is that interest
rates on regulated savings deposits are set well above the ECB’s policy rate.7 At the same time,
lending opportunities are increasing as corporate credit demand is picking up, and banks can
use the ECB’s low-interest Targeted Long-term Refinancing Operations funds to expand credit.
Given these offsetting forces, the net impact from QE on banks’ profitability is difficult to predict.



Insurers. The margin squeeze from the low interest environment will likely be exacerbated by
new regulations (Solvency II) requiring significant holdings of safe assets. Low returns may also
increase redemption rates, as consumers may shift to alternative investments. However, insurers
in France have greater room for maneuver than those in some other countries, as the minimum
guaranteed return on life insurances is adjusted every year.



Markets. Low interest rates could feed into asset prices as investors shift into equities, higheryield instruments, and possibly real estate. The main stock market index rose by 12 percent in
the year to mid-June. Real estate prices have been on a declining trend, but remain
about 10−15 percent overvalued by some metrics, and price pressures could reemerge over the

7

Around 60 percent of these deposits are centralized at the Caisse des Dépôts et Consignations and earmarked
mainly for building social housing. Banks are partly remunerated for the centralized deposits, and must pay the full
guaranteed return (currently 1 percent for the main savings schemes) for the portion that is not.

medium term. However, the impact of future price adjustments is mitigated by relatively
stringent lending standards and manageable levels of household debt.

Return on Equity

30.
Banks and supervisors should continue to adapt to a changing regulatory
environment. With banking union taking hold, the SSM has begun supervising France’s banks, and
the remaining directives on resolution and the deposit guarantees are slated for transposition into
French law in the coming months. French banks have strengthened their capital ratios and fared
relatively well in the ECB’s Comprehensive Assessment. However, challenges remain, including
relatively low leverage ratios and risk weights, continued dependence on wholesale funding, and
uncertain profitability prospects. Additional capital raising efforts may be needed over the medium
term as national regulatory discretion is

31.
Views of the authorities. The authorities acknowledged that the current interest rates on
regulated savings deposits, while encouraging a stable pool of savings, may affect the transmission
of ECB monetary policy, and took note of staff’s recommendation to reduce these rates and review
tax advantages for certain savings and insurances products. Regarding insurers, the authorities are
carrying out stress tests to identify and address any risks well in advance. More generally, the
authorities are closely monitoring the possible side-effects of QE, but have observed very little
“search-for-yield” behavior so far. On the housing market, they do not see risks to financial stability
at this point, given prudent lending practices based on repayment ability, the predominance of
fixed-rate mortgages, and the mortgage insurance scheme. Regarding the changing regulatory
landscape, the authorities considered that France’s large banks were reasonably well placed to adapt
to SSM-related harmonization. However, they recognized that the combination of tougher capital
and liquidity requirements and low interest margins could weigh on banks’ profitability and limit
credit expansion over the medium term. The authorities noted that they are monitoring risks related
to “shadow banking”, and that the EU directive on alternative investment fund management has
brought new investment entities into the regulatory net.

This reflects structural factors that constrain retail deposits, including tax benefits on life insurance and regulated
savings (see above footnote).

STAFF APPRAISAL
32.
A solid recovery is underway, with short-term risks broadly balanced. After several years
of near-stagnation, growth is expected to pick up, alongside gradually rising inflation. The recovery
is supported by an accommodative external environment, in particular sharply lower oil prices, a
depreciated euro, and very low interest rates. Growth could turn out stronger in the short term if
QE and improved confidence boost investment. On the downside, external risks include potential
confidence losses, a sustained increase in energy prices, or a pronounced slowdown in advanced
economies. The external position has improved, but remains moderately weaker than that implied
by fundamentals.
33.
The general policy direction is appropriate, but further reform efforts are needed to
address the structural rigidities that continue to weigh heavily on medium-term prospects.
Supported by a more accommodative macroeconomic policy mix, the output gap should narrow
gradually in the coming years. However, potential output growth remains well below pre-crisis rates,
structural unemployment high, and competitiveness weak. In addition, France faces a very difficult
fiscal adjustment task, with public spending having reached record-high levels and the debt ratio
continuing to rise. The authorities are taking significant actions to address these challenges, notably
by containing public spending, reducing the labor tax wedge, and advancing supply-side reforms.
These important measures should be followed up by additional, bold reforms to ensure lasting
results in reining in public spending, reviving job creation, and removing growth bottlenecks.
34.
The switch to expenditure-based fiscal consolidation is welcome. High and rising
government spending is at the heart of France’s fiscal challenges—and a decisive break is needed to
reverse the growth of public debt and make room for eventually alleviating the heavy tax burden on
the economy. While the government’s medium-term fiscal framework would reduce the overall
deficit narrowly below 3 percent of GDP in 2017 under baseline assumptions, there is a clear risk
that medium-term targets may be missed and debt continues to increase in the event that growth
or inflation disappoint or new spending pressures arise.
35.
Fiscal adjustment should be underpinned by structural measures to keep real spending
flat starting in 2016. A fiscal anchor of zero real primary spending growth, with appropriate burden
sharing across levels of government, would deliver structural adjustment of about ½ percent of GDP
per year. While not detracting unduly from demand, it would ensure that medium-term fiscal targets
are safely met and debt is placed on a firm downward trajectory by 2017. Spending containment
should rely on higher quality structural measures based on regular broad-based expenditure reviews
at all levels of government—notably through staffing reform, streamlining of local government
institutions, better targeting of social benefits, and a further increase in the effective retirement age.
36.
Building on recent labor market reforms, additional broad-based efforts are needed to
return to pre-crisis rates of job creation. Following the reduction in the tax wedge for lower salary
ranges under the Responsibility Pact and CICE tax credit, the Macron and Rebsamen laws will help
reduce judicial uncertainty around dismissals and improve the social dialogue.

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

FRANCE

However, unemployment may still decline only very slowly unless broad-based additional efforts are
made. These should include: further expanding the flexibility for social partners to agree at firm level
on hours and wages; limiting increases in the minimum wage to inflation as long as unemployment
remains high; and strengthening job search incentives for those receiving unemployment or welfare
benefits. In addition, education and training resources should be better targeted to the young, the
low skilled, and the unemployed.
37.
Recent momentum on product market reforms should be maintained to remove
growth bottlenecks. The Macron law is an important step forward, and should be followed by
further liberalization of regulated professions. The disincentives for smaller companies to grow
should be reduced, including through steps envisaged under the draft Rebsamen law and efforts to
lighten other regulatory requirements and red tape. Removing barriers to competition in services
would help provide better incentives for innovation and productivity growth. Further efforts are also
needed to alleviate constraints on the supply of affordable housing and improve the targeting of
housing assistance.
38.
The financial sector has further to go to adapt to a changing economic and regulatory
environment. While France’s banks are reasonably well placed to adapt to SSM supervision, the low
interest environment is putting pressure on margins for both banks and insurance companies. Risks
from this environment, and from banks’ reliance on wholesale funding, should remain under close
monitoring as banks continue to strengthen capital and liquidity alongside evolving regulatory
standards under European and global initiatives. To support the proper transmission of ECB
monetary policy, guaranteed interest rates under the regulated savings schemes should be reduced.
Tax incentives on financial savings and insurance products should be reviewed.
39.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard 12month cycle.

Appendix I. Estimating the Impact of External Shocks
Prepared by Esther Perez Ruiz
The combined effect of major external shocks affecting the French economy since the summer
of 2014 is estimated at +0.8 percentage points of additional growth, cumulatively over 2015–16.
Shocks. Like other euro area economies, France has been affected by four external shocks since the
summer (Figure I.1): the slowdown in demand from trading partners, the euro depreciation, the
decline in oil prices, and the interest rate effects of QE. The simulation below quantifies the impact
of these shocks on France’s real GDP growth over 2015–16.

Channels. Simulations focus on the most significant channels that affect real GDP growth and its
components: (i) impact of the energy price windfall on private consumption and business
investment, and imports; (ii) impact of the slowdown in demand from trading partners on exports;
(iii) impact of the euro depreciation on exports; (iv) impact of the QE-induced reduction in the cost
of capital on investment.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

35

FRANCE

Methodology. Simulations are conducted ex ante, relative to a (free-of-shocks) macroeconomic
baseline from the October 2014 WEO. The size of each shock is quantified by comparing the
September 2014 and March 2015 global WEO assumptions. The shocks are then fed into demand
equations (based on error correction model regressions) estimated for France by Lebrun and Pérez
Ruiz (2014). Simulations are conducted one by one, all other things being equal.
Assumptions. Several assumptions underlie the simulations: (i) Lower energy prices are fully passed
onto consumers. (ii) As per WEO assumptions, the ULC-based REER is projected to depreciate by 2.2
percent in 2015 and to remain broadly stable through 2016. (iii) As per WEO assumptions, export
demand addressed to France in 2015 and 2016 is 2.7 and 0.4 percent lower than projected in
September 2014. (iv) The QE-related term premium reduction (difference between 10-year and 2year yields) between September 2014 and March 2015 lowers the real cost of capital via lending
rates and equities.
Results


Oil price decline. The gross impact of lower energy prices on consumption and investment is
+0.4 percent of GDP cumulatively over 2015–16, which is partly offset by feeding into higher
imports (about -0.2 percent of GDP impact). The relatively muted net impact on real GDP growth
is in line with past patterns, where some of windfall gains are, at least initially, saved.



Euro depreciation. The cumulative impact of the euro depreciation over 2015–16 is estimated at
+0.5 percentage points of additional real GDP growth, based on a 2 percent impact on exports,
which are projected to grow by 5.5 and 4.9 percent in real terms in 2015 and 2016 respectively.
The growth impact of the euro depreciation is muted by France’s relatively low export-to-GDP
ratio, its high share of exports to countries in the euro area, and the very limited depreciation in
real ULC terms in the case of France.



Demand from trading partners. The cumulative impact of the slowdown in global demand for
French exports over 2015–16 is estimated at -0.3 percentage points of reduced real GDP growth.



QE-related term premium reduction. The cumulative impact of lower borrowing costs on
investment is estimated at +0.4 percentage points of additional real GDP growth over 2015–16,
offset by higher investment-related imports of about 0.3 percent of GDP. The impact of QE is
subject to high uncertainty. The scenario is based on the historical link between interest rates
and investment, and does not model the expectations channel or the effects of protracted low
growth on investment and credit demand.

Net impact. While the joint impact of positive shocks is estimated at 1.4 percent of GDP over 2015–
16, this is partly offset by the import response and lower partner country demand. Moreover, the
simulations do not capture all developments that feed into staff’s evolving GDP projections such as
near-term forecast errors, base effects from data revisions, changes in the timing of impact of
policies and reforms, and other domestic and external factors affecting near-term growth.

Appendix II. Main Recommendations of
the 2014 Article IV Consultation and Authorities’ Actions
Fund Recommendations

Policy Actions

Back the strategy of steady and moderate fiscal
consolidation by comprehensive upfront measures
in the fall budget.

Wage-scale freezes and under-indexation of certain social benefits did not deliver the
expected savings in the context of low growth and inflation. As a result, the pace of
fiscal consolidation through 2017 is now slower than envisaged in last year’s Stability
Program.

Rely on structural measures to ensure a permanent
slowdown in spending growth.

Targeted expenditure reviews were introduced in specific areas this year and should
lead to durable savings in the 2016 budget law. The multi-year budget law adopted
late 2014 also creates an indicative target for local governments’ spending growth
(ODEDEL) aimed at emulating the ONDAM cap for health spending growth.

Fiscal Policy

Financial Sector Policy
Level the playing field in the taxation of financial
instruments

No reform of tax incentives is planned at this stage.

Structural Reforms
Open protected sectors to greater competition

The Macron law, expected to be adopted soon, liberalizes legal professions, intercity
transport, and retail opening hours, while broadening the mandate of the
Competition Authority

Enhance the scope for enterprise-level negotiation
based on a more cooperative social dialogue

The draft Rebsamen law, expected to be adopted by year end, would reform the legal
framework for social dialogue in SMEs. The Macron law provides firms in severe
economic difficulty greater flexibility in applying “job preservation agreements”.

Set the minimum wage with a view to increasing
job opportunities for the low skilled.

No changes are currently envisaged.

Appendix III. Debt Sustainability Analysis9
Under the baseline scenario, the debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to peak at 98.2 percent in 2016 and to
decline to 93 percent by 2020 as economic recovery gains traction and the primary balance shifts to a
surplus starting in 2019. Due to the maturity structure of the French debt, gross financing needs would
increase substantially in 2016, to 10.2 percent of GDP, but decline thereafter. The debt-to-GDP ratio is
projected to be higher than was forecast previously due to an upward revision in historical debt data,
weaker nominal GDP growth, and slower pace of adjustment. Accordingly, public debt is expected to
remain above 93 percent of GDP throughout the projection period and presents vulnerabilities as
illustrated by the stress scenarios. The debt ratio would be bumped up significantly in the event of
protracted stagnation. The impact of lower fiscal consolidation and higher interest rate remains
comparatively more limited.
Background. The combined effect of low growth over several years and the persistence of high
fiscal deficits, augmented by the fiscal

stimulus of 2009, have increased the debt-to(In Percent)

Owing to the sharp decline in interest
rates, the rising debt has had a limited impact
on the debt service. Interest payments were
at the historically low level of 2.2 percent of
GDP in 201410 and are projected to continue

Yields on French debt are at historically low
levels. The flattening of the yield curve that
occurred in 2014 has been supported by QE.
The benchmark yield (10 years) has declined
from 4.7 percent in June 2008 to about 0.9
percent end-May 2015. The spreads over
German Bunds, which had increased to
almost 190 basis points in November 2011,
were at about 40 basis points in mid-June
2015.

to decline over the projection period. Given this low level, the recent drop in interest rate and in
inflation11 has little impact on fiscal balance.12
Baseline. Staff projects that the debt-to-GDP ratio will peak at 98.2 percent in 2016 and then
decline to 93 percent in 2020. Interest payments would remain low averaging 1.9 of GDP over 201520 because: (i) fiscal consolidation leads to a primary surplus starting in 2019 and (ii) interest rates
are expected to remain low, increasing only slightly during the projection period.


Macroeconomic assumptions. Recent growth performance has been affected by the weak
external environment and the drag caused by large structural fiscal adjustment in 2011–14. After
several years of near-stagnation, the economy is projected to grow by 1.2 percent in 2015, and
then rise steadily to 1.9 percent by the end of the projection period, with the output gap closed
in 2020.



Fiscal outlook. The pace of structural adjustment has slowed. Reaching 1 percentage point per
year in 2011–13, it has slowed to 0.5 percentage point in 2014 and is expected, in the baseline,
to average 0.3 percentage point per year during 2015–20. Primary balance would shift to a
surplus in 2019 and would be above its debt-stabilizing level starting in 2017.



Debt levels and gross financing needs. The gross financing need, despite the expected
increase in 2016 remains below the threshold. Part of the increase in the debt ratio reflects
financial support to other Euro area countries which grew from 0.2 percent of GDP in 2010 to
3.2 percent of GDP in 2014.13 This support is expected to decline starting in 2015.

Realism of Projections. The median forecast error for real GDP growth during 2006–14 is
-0.52 percent suggesting there is a modest upward bias in the staff projections. The median forecast
bias for inflation stands at -0.21 percent suggesting again a slight upward bias in the staff
projections. At -0.76 percent, the median forecast error for primary balance suggests that staff
projections have proved relatively optimistic.
Since the publication of the staff report for the 2014 Article IV Consultation, historical debt data
have been revised leading to an increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio level of 0.5 percentage point in
2013 and, as a result, during the projection period. Beyond this statistical impact, the debt ratio is
projected to increase faster in the short term (by 1.7 percentage point of GDP in 2015 vs.
0.8 percentage point) and to start declining one year later (2017 instead of 2016). As a result, the
debt ratio is projected to be in 2019 only 0.1 percentage point lower than in 2014. This is much less
than the 5.2 percentage point reduction envisaged previously. About half of the difference in the
11

The drop in inflation reduces the debt service as 11 percent of French debt is indexed on inflation.

12

In 2014, implicit interest rate were lower by 0.15 percentage point than projected in the Staff report for the 2014
Article IV Consultation and inflation by 0.4 percentage point. The fiscal impact was limited as the reduction in the
debt service was less than 0.1 percent of GDP

change in the debt ratio over 2014–19 can be explained by slower nominal GDP growth and the
remainder by other factors notably slower fiscal consolidation.14
The projected fiscal adjustment appears feasible. The reduction in the cyclically-adjusted primary
balance would average 0.3 percent per year during 2015−20. This is slightly less than the reduction
achieved during 2013–14. Cross-country experience also suggests that fiscal adjustment projections
are realistic. The projected adjustment and level of the CAPB are below the thresholds that would
cast doubt on the feasibility of the adjustment, based on high debt country experience.15
Heat map. Risks levels from the debt level are deemed high given that the relevant threshold to
which France’s values are compared is 85 percent and this threshold is breached under baseline and
all stress test scenarios. In contrast, France’s gross financing needs remain below the benchmark of
20 percent of GDP in the baseline and all stress test scenarios. The debt profile remains below
relevant thresholds except for the share of public debt held by foreigners. As of end-2014,
foreigners held 64.3 percent of French debt, a level substantially lower than the peak of 70.6 percent
reached in mid-2010.
Shocks and Stress Tests. The DSA framework suggests that France’s government debt-to-GDP ratio
remains below 107 percent and its gross financing needs would not exceed 12¼ percent of GDP
under different macroeconomic and fiscal shocks.


Growth shock. Under this scenario, real output growth rates are lower by one standard
deviation over 2015–2016, i.e. 1.6 percentage points relative to the baseline scenario. The
assumed decline in growth leads to lower inflation (0.25 percentage points per 1 percentage
point decrease in GDP growth) and the interest rate is assumed to increase 25 basis points for
every 1 percent of GDP worsening of primary balance. Under this scenario, the debt-to-GDP
ratio would increases to 106.3 percent of GDP in 2017 and declines thereafter.



Primary balance shock. This scenario examines the implications of a dual shock of lower
revenues and rise in interest rate, leading to a cumulative 1.5 percent deterioration in the
primary balance over 2016–2020. Under this scenario, the debt-to-GDP ratio would increase to
almost 100.7 percent of GDP in 2017 and declines thereafter.



Interest rate shock. This scenario assumes an increase of 246 basis points increase in the cost
of debt throughout the projection period. The deterioration of public debt and gross financing
needs are back-loaded as old debt gradually matures16 and new higher interest rate debt is

14

Average nominal GDP growth over 2014-19 is projected to be 0.68 percentage point lower on account of lower
inflation (0.43) and lower real growth (0.25). In addition, in nominal terms, the improvement in the primary balance is
expected be 42 percent smaller.
15

More specifically, at 1.3 percent of GDP, the largest projected adjustment over any three years during the
projection is below the threshold of 3 percent of GDP. In addition, the maximum average level of the cyclicallyadjusted primary deficit for any consecutive 3-year period during the projection horizon reaches is 0.75 percent of
GDP, well below than the threshold of 3.5 percent of GDP.
16

As of end April 2015, the average maturity of debt is 7 years and 7days.

contracted. In 2020, the impact on the gross financing needs is less than 1 percent of GDP and
about 2½ percentage points for the debt-to-GDP ratio.


Real exchange rate shock. This scenario assumes 13 percent devaluation of the real exchange
rate in 2016 and examines the impact on debt through the inflation channel. Under this
scenario, the debt-to-GDP ratio would be marginally larger (0.5 percentage point at most) than
in the baseline.



Combined macro-fiscal shock. This scenario aggregates shocks to real growth, the interest
rate, the exchange rate, and the primary balance while taking care not to double-count the
effects of individual shocks. Under this scenario, debt would reach 106.5 percent of GDP in 2017
and decline to 103 percent of GDP in 2020. The gross financing needs would peak at
12.1 percent of GDP in 2017, which remains below the 20 percent benchmark considered by the
heat map.

Views of the authorities. The authorities project a debt profile similar to staff’s with the debt ratio
also starting to decline in 2017. However, they expect the debt-to-GDP ratio to be slightly lower and
to decline faster than staff on account of faster nominal growth and fiscal consolidation notably in
the second half of the projection period.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to
materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks
surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and
30 percent, and “high” a probability of 30 percent or more). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall
level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize
jointly.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

France
Foreign asset
and liability
position and
trajectory

Background. After averaging near balance in the four years before the global crisis, the net international investment position
(NIIP) deteriorated, to around -15 percent of GDP in 2013, reflecting current account deficits and valuation losses. Gross asset and
liability positions grew steadily in the pre-crisis period, in parallel with the expansion of French banks’ balance sheets. Since the
crisis, the gross asset position has declined moderately and stood at 271 percent of GDP in 2013, with large exposures to Italy and
Spain. Public external debt accounts for about 20 percent of the gross liability position, which came to about 286 percent of GDP
in 2013. Stability of the French public debt market is an important element of euro-zone financial stability. Current projections
assume a small surplus current account surplus and a stabilization of the NIIP to GDP ratio over the medium term.
Assessment. The net external position is negative but its size and trajectory do not raise sustainability concerns. However, there
are vulnerabilities due to large exposures to Italy and Spain on the asset side, and to the external public debt on the liability side.

Real exchange
rate

Background. The trend deterioration in unit labor costs (11.3 percent cumulative appreciation of the ULC-based real effective
exchange over the last 10 years) points to a loss of competitiveness consistent with the assessment of an imbalance in the current
account. However, such loss of competitiveness is less evident based on relative price indicators, such as CPI-based real effective
exchange rate (REER), as firms appear to have squeezed profit margins to retain price competitiveness. The EBA REER regression
model estimates a 10 percent overvaluation (as informed by the REER regression in levels), close to the overvaluation underlying
the EBA CA regression estimate of about 7 percent. 1\ The recent euro/dollar exchange rate realignment implies a 5 percent
depreciation in the CPI-based REER relative to the 2014 average (in turn ½ percent below the 2013 average).
Assessment. Staff assesses the real exchange rate to be 5 to 10 percent overvalued, as the recent depreciation of the euro is
modest in ULC-based REER terms and will not fully correct past competitiveness losses.
Background. The current account deficit has been financed mostly by debt inflows (portfolio and other investment), while
outward direct investment was generally higher than inward investment. Flows in financial derivatives have grown sizably on both
the asset and liability side since 2008. The capital account is open.
Assessment. France remains exposed to financial market risks but the structure of financial flows does not point to specific
vulnerabilities.

FX intervention
and reserves
level

Background. The euro has the status of a global reserve currency.

Technical
background
notes

1/ The EBA Level REER model estimates a gap of some +10 percent, while the gap estimated by the EBA Index REER model is
about -1 percent. Considering in addition the ULC based REER, which provides an additional perspective on the loss of
competitiveness, the staff’s assessment is that the real exchange rate is above the level consistent with fundamentals and
desirable policy settings by 5-10 percent.

Assessment. Reserves held by the euro area are typically low relative to standard metrics, but the currency is free floating.

The external position in 2014 was
weaker than the level consistent with
medium-term fundamentals and
desirable policy settings. Developments
as of May 2015, including the
depreciation of the euro and lower oil
prices, suggest some strengthening of
the external position. However, it is still
moderately weaker than implied by
fundamentals, given high unit labor
costs and fiscal deficits.
To improve cost competitiveness
durably, the labor tax wedge cuts
undertaken since 2013 (equivalent to 3
percent of total labor costs, spanning
2014-17) should be backed by wage
moderation. Measures taken in 2013 to
improve non-cost competitiveness
(labor market reforms, regulatory
simplification, and support to SMEs)
reinforced by a comprehensive reform
package (“Macron Law”) this year.
Potential policy responses:
Wage moderation (especially of the
minimum wage), continued reform of
the labor market, and productivityenhancing reforms (increasing
competition in product markets and
further regulatory simplification) would
help restore competitiveness. Along
with the planned gradual elimination of
the fiscal deficit over the medium term,
these measures should help correct the
external imbalance (as well as promote
growth).

FRANCE

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Capital and
financial
accounts: flows
and policy
measures

Background. Over the past decade, the current account has deteriorated from a surplus of 2.3 percent of GDP in 2002 to a deficit
of 1 percent in 2014, mostly due to structural factors (the cyclically-adjusted deficit is estimated at -1.5 percent of GDP). The
deterioration originates from a worsening net saving position of the private sector and higher government deficits in equal
proportions. The current account is set to improve significantly in 2015, to -0.4 percent of GDP, up from 1 percent in 2014,
reflecting in part lower oil prices (the energy trade deficit amounted to 3 percent in 2014; savings from lower energy prices this
year are estimated at 0.9 percent of GDP) and the depreciation of the euro.
Assessment. The staff assesses the 2014 current account to be 1 to 3 percent of GDP below its cyclically-adjusted norm. This is
consistent with the EBA model estimate that the cyclically-adjusted current account is 2 percent weaker than the value consistent
with medium-term fundamentals and desirable policy settings. Recent developments, including the depreciation of the euro and
lower oil prices, suggest some strengthening of the external position. Over the medium term, the current account deficit is
projected to stabilize at about 0.6 percent of GDP as imports pick up in line with domestic demand. The gradual elimination of
the fiscal deficit will help narrow the EBA-estimated gap.

Summary: The report found that France has achieved a high level of fiscal transparency and has
introduced a number of improvements in coverage and presentation of fiscal information. Notable
areas of progress include the development in the final accounts publication to include more
complete information on government assets and liabilities as well as disclosure of contingent
liabilities. Accounting standards have been changed to reflect accruals principles in a number of
areas, and these standards are clearly explained. The staff suggested that further steps could be
taken to identify and report quasi-fiscal activities in the budget presentation, provide a more
consolidated picture of fiscal activity outside the appropriation process, and improve the
reconciliation of stated policies with outcomes at the general government level.
These issues have been addressed in the Loi organique aux lois de finance (LOLF), which has become
fully effective on January 1, 2006. In addition to the annual appropriations, the first multi-annual
fiscal framework law was adopted in January 2009, and contains fiscal objectives for the
period 2009–12. The budget is organized along missions and provides details on the level of
appropriations for each mission and performance indicators by which the expected results of the
mission will be assessed ex post. The State Audit Office has been given the new assignment of
certifying the public accounts, and implementation of accruals basis accounting has been confirmed.
Parliamentary oversight powers have been strengthened.

No. 01/197, 11/05/01

Transparency in Monetary and Financial Policies—Update

IMF Country Report
No. 02/248, 11/13/02

Summary: The 2000 ROSC noted that transparency of financial policies is accorded a high priority
by all financial agencies assessed, and they are in observance of the good practices of the Code of
Good Practices on Transparency in Monetary and Financial Policies. The major agencies disclose their
objectives, their legal and institutional frameworks, and have open processes of policymaking and
regulation. The principles of transparency are observed by dissemination of relevant information to
the public and in the agencies’ arrangements for internal conduct, integrity, and accountability.
However, the staff noted that the framework for supervision and regulation applicable to mutual
insurance firms is not as well defined and suggested to improve its transparency. The transparency
of monetary policy was not assessed by the Fund team as the Banque de France is a member of the
European System of Central Banks and no longer conducts independent monetary policy.
Subsequently, the framework for supervision and regulation applicable to a specific group of mutual
insurance firms was modified in a number of steps. In August 2003, legislation created a single
supervisory body, the Commission de Contrôle des Assurances, Mutuelles et Institutions de

4

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

FRANCE

Prévoyance (CCAMIP) by merging the regular insurance supervisor (CCA) and mutualities’ supervisor
(CCMIP). Coordination with the banking sector supervisors was strengthened and the powers of the
supervisory authorities extended. In 2010, supervision of the banking and insurance sectors was
unified under the Autorité de contrôle prudentiel (ACP), which subsequently also was granted
resolution powers and was renamed the Autorité de contrôle prudentiel et de résolution (ACPR).

Summary: The report found that France is in observance of the Fund’s Special Data Dissemination
Standard (SDDS). In particular, the mandate of INSEE and the Banque de France for the production
of the six macroeconomic datasets is clearly defined, with the reporting burden and the
confidentiality provisions given special consideration notably through the CNIS. Professionalism is
central to the statistical operations of the two institutions, internationally and/or European accepted
methodologies are generally followed, the degree of accuracy and reliability of the six datasets is
remarkable, statistics are relevant and provided on a timely basis, and they are accessible to the
public.
The report made a number of suggestions for further improvements: the responsibility of INSEE as
the producer of government finance statistics should be clarified; data sharing between the Banque
de France and the rest of the French statistical system improved; classification and valuation
methods in balance-of-payments statistics reviewed; consistency between the current account of the
balance of payments and the goods and services account in the national accounts improved; the
timing of revisions in the quarterly and annual national accounts aligned; and identification of data
production units of INSEE facilitated.
France continues to implement several of the 2003 ROSC Data Module recommendations, including
by promoting a broader understanding of statistical data revisions, making greater use of firm-level
data to improve the measurement of changes in stocks, and intensifying work on portfolio
investment income with the objective of starting to record those transactions on an accrual basis.

Stress Testing the Banking Sector

IMF Country Report
No. 13/185, June 2013

Summary: The 2004 report concluded that France’s financial sector is strong and well supervised.
No weaknesses that could cause systemic risks were identified. The strength of the system is
supported by the financial soundness indicators and the strong conformity to the supervisory and
regulatory standards approved by the Basel Committee, IAIS, IOSCO, FATF, and CPSS. The degree of
observance of the transparency code is high in all relevant areas. The French banking sector has
been modernized and restructured over the past two decades and is well capitalized. Systemic
vulnerabilities in the important insurance sector are well contained. Securities markets are large and
sophisticated.
The FSAP Update undertaken in January and June 2012 confirmed the resilience of France’s financial
system to severe market pressures but also identified challenges faced by the system. While its
structure has contributed to solid profit generation, the crisis exposed the risks posed by the banks’
size, complexity, and dependence on wholesale funding. The larger banks have been actively
restructuring their balance sheets—moving to more stable sources of funding; reducing their crossborder presence; and building up capital. They remain, however, vulnerable to sustained disruptions
in funding markets and reduced profitability, which would cause delays in meeting capital-raising
plans.
The 2012 report confirmed that the regulatory and supervisory regime for banks, insurance, and
securities market was of a very high standard. Areas for improvement that emerged from the FSAP
Update included greater de jure independence of supervisory authorities; disclosure of the capital
treatment and related financial interactions within complex banking groups; a move toward a more

6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

FRANCE

economic risk-focused approach to insurance regulation and supervision; and enhanced supervision
of investment service providers and financial advisors.
The 2012 report also found disclosure-related shortcomings. French banks and listed companies,
more generally, make extensive public financial disclosures under IFRS, and as a result of bank
regulations (Pillar III of Basel II). Nonetheless, disclosure of financial sector data falls short of
international best practice and enhancements would be highly desirable. Market discipline would
benefit from the publication of regular and comparable data on an institution-by-institution basis,
as well as detailed official analyses of financial sector developments in France.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
The economic database is comprehensive and of high quality, and data provision to the Fund is
adequate for surveillance. The authorities regularly publish a full range of economic and financial
data, and calendar dates of main statistical releases are also provided. France subscribes to the
Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard. Country is currently working on implementing the
transmission of data in electronic format using the Statistical Data and Metadata A data ROSC
mission conducted an assessment of the statistical system in March 2003, and the report was
published in October 2003. A factual update to the main report was published in November 2004.
National Accounts: France adopted the European System of Accounts 2010 (ESA 2010) in May 2014.
The transition from the ESA 1995 (ESA95) entailed a revision of national accounts data. New data
sources have been incorporated in the new estimates. As a result of these changes, the GDP level
in 2010 has been revised 3.2 percent upward. Historical data series are available from 1949.
Government Finance Statistics: Starting from September 2014, government finance statistics (GFS)
data will be based on ESA 2010 methodology which is likely to include revisions of the general
government deficit and debt levels from 1995 onwards. Revised data series were published in
October 2014. Although the source data are collected by the Ministry of Economy and Finance,
INSEE is principally responsible for the compilation and dissemination of fiscal data in a framework
that is consistent with ESA.
Monetary and Financial Statistics: Monetary data reported for International Financial Statistics are
based on the European Central Bank’s (ECB) framework for collecting, compiling, and reporting
monetary data.. Statistics for International Financial Statistics on banking institutions and monetary
aggregates are prepared on a monthly basis and are timely. Monetary data are also disseminated in
the quarterly IFS Supplement on monetary and financial statistics.
External Sector: Starting in June 2014, monthly balance-of-payments statistics are published using
the guidelines set out in the sixth edition of the Balance of Payments and International Investment
Position Manual (BPM6). Back casting of previous periods started with the publication of the Annual
report of the balance of payments and the international investment position end-June 2014. It is
expected that greater international consistency will be achieved once all EU members adopt the
BPM6.

Statement by the Staff Representative on France
Executive Board Meeting
July 8, 2015
This statement provides information that has become available since the issuance of the staff
report. The information does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
There is substantial uncertainty in the euro area following recent events in Greece, including
the expiration of the European program last week and Sunday’s referendum. The broader
market reaction has been generally contained, with the euro exchange rate remaining stable
against the U.S. dollar, sovereign spreads widening moderately for a number of countries,
and equity prices declining throughout the euro area. For France, sovereign yields have
remained broadly stable since the issuance of the staff report, while stock prices have
declined alongside other euro area markets, with contagion effects particularly noticeable for
bank equities. Heightened uncertainty may continue to weigh on markets and sentiment.
As noted in the staff report, direct trade and financial linkages between France and Greece
are limited, but adverse developments in Greece could weigh on confidence in the region and
indirectly affect France’s economic prospects. Overall, staff continues to see risks to France’s
short-term growth outlook as broadly balanced at this stage, with heightened uncertainty
around Greece weighing on the downside.
The recent events highlight the importance of timely and effective policy actions to manage
potential spillovers, especially at the euro area level. Beyond the near term, there should be a
concerted effort to accelerate deeper integration within the euro area and strengthen firewalls.
The upcoming euro area Article IV report will elaborate on these policy challenges.

Statement by Mr. de Villeroché, Executive Director for France
July 8, 2015

We thank staff for the rich discussions during the 2015 Article IV Consultations with France
as well as for the well-written report.
French economic recovery is well underway. The authorities have been pursuing a
comprehensive reform agenda over the past three years, to reduce the fiscal deficit, address
excessive unemployment and improve competitiveness. This strategy is starting to bear
fruits.
While we broadly concur with the staff appraisal, which validates the agenda that is being
implemented since 2012, we think that the report could have put a stronger emphasis on the
impact of recent or on-going reforms. Since the beginning of the crisis, the French economy
demonstrated its resilience. In the long term, a strong birth rate, rising innovation efforts by
French corporates, a highly qualified and productive workforce, excellent infrastructure and a
stable investment rate during the crisis are factors bound to support France’s growth
prospects.
1. Economic outlook
In the short run, an improvement of the economic situation is on-going, structural reforms are
starting to pay off and external factors, such as the decrease in oil prices and a moderate
depreciation of the effective exchange rate, are supporting aggregate demand. GDP rose by a
robust 0.6 percent (quarter-on-quarter) in Q1 2015.
Staff growth projections of 1.2 percent in 2015 and 1.5 percent in 2016 appear slightly above
the government’s own and voluntarily cautious scenario (1.0 percent in 2015 and 1.5 percent
in 2016). Staff projections are also in the lower range of the available forecasts: the latest
Consensus Forecasts stands at 1.2 percent in 2015 and 1.6 percent in 2016, and the OECD
and the European Commission both expect 1.1 percent in 2015 and 1.7 percent in 2016.
In the medium term, growth should gradually improve on the back of internal drivers that are
expected to gather strength and gradually replace the role of external factors. Investment is
expected to strengthen in line with more robust activity levels. In the Stability Programme,
growth is forecast to reach 1.5 percent in 2017 and 1.8 percent in 2018, broadly in line with
staff projections.
2. Public finances
2014 execution
French public deficit stands at 4.0 percent of GDP in 2014 which is significantly lower than
the objective set in the last multiyear budget law for 2014-2019 passed in December 2014
(4.4 percent of GDP). This performance resulted from the strict containment of public

2
spending. Indeed, nominal public spending excluding tax credits has increased by only
0.9 percent in 2014, significantly below the target set in the 2014 Stability Programme
(1.4 percent) and the lowest in decades.
Fiscal medium-term consolidation path
France targets a 0.5 point of GDP structural adjustment of public balance in 2015, 2016 and
2017, which will allow under a prudent growth scenario to bring back the headline deficit
below 3 percent in 2017 with a safety margin, a trajectory which is compliant with our
European commitments. This pace of consolidation, fully based on expenditure containment,
strikes the right balance between the need to secure public finances sustainability in the
medium term and avoid a drag on growth in the short term. We do not find that the
alternative fiscal adjustment path presented by staff makes a compelling argument for a faster
consolidation.
To reach these targets, the government has committed itself to implement a EUR 50 billion
savings plan over 2015-2017. This commitment has been enacted in the multiyear budget law
of December 2014. To offset the negative impact of low inflation, the French authorities
committed to undertake additional expenditure-based savings measures, representing EUR
4 billion in 2015 and EUR 5 billion in 2016.
Long term sustainability
Strong demographics, the improvement in its older workers participation rate and the
phasing-in of recent pension reforms, have placed France in a better position to deal with its
ageing population than most of its OECD partners. The latest pension reform adopted in
2014 will raise the number of years of service required to obtain a full pension, up to 43
years in 2035. Negotiations between social partners for a new agreement to be signed in 2015
on the financing of the supplementary retirement scheme are currently underway. According
to the latest long term projections of the European Ageing Report 2015, public pension
spending is expected to decrease by 2.8 percent of GDP between 2013 and 2060. The
financial equilibrium of France’s pension system is no longer a major issue for the long-term
sustainability of public finances.
3. Structural reforms
France is fully committed to reforming its economy in order to reduce unemployment,
continue to improve competitiveness and enhance its potential growth.
Improving cost competitiveness
Labor cost and tax reductions (Crédit d’Impôt Compétitivité Emploi and the Responsibility
and Solidarity Pact) represent a positive supply shock of almost EUR 40 billion (close to 2
percent of GDP) which has already led to concrete results: the average unit labor cost in the
manufacturing sector is inferior to German unit labor costs and profit margins have been
recovering since the beginning of 2015 (and reached their highest level since early 2011).

3
Empirical studies, including previous staff working papers, concur to find a very positive
impact of labor tax cuts on employment and growth.
Little is said in the report on the on-going external rebalancing. Over the pre-crisis decade,
real wages have been in line with productivity in France. It is only in the aftermath of the
crisis that real wages have slowed down less markedly than productivity, due in particular to
negative inflation surprises. However, it is worth noting that unit labor costs in France have
been less dynamic than in Germany since mid 2012, which is a positive development not
only from a domestic perspective but also for demand rebalancing within the euro area.
Cutting red tape and improving public administration efficiency
The intensification of the “simplification shock” will help improving the non-cost
competitiveness of our economy. The measures already implemented enabled EUR
3.3 billion savings since 2013, and a permanent council of companies’ executives and public
administration representatives will propose and assess new measures every six months.
In parallel, the government has also launched several institutional reforms that will
significantly improve the functioning of the public administration and will improve the long
term efficiency of local governments. The number of regions will be halved by merging
administrative structures, a major reform since the administrative map will be completely
revamped. The repartition of competencies among the different levels of local government
will be further simplified and clarified.
Improving the functioning of product markets
The Macron Law on growth, economic activity, and equal economic opportunities aims to
enhance competition across the economy.
The law which will be definitively adopted by summer 2015 will improve the functioning of
transportation services, of retail distribution (with more power given to the French
competition authority), will open up regulated professions and link their tariffs to costs, as
well as release the conditions governing Sunday and evening working. The law will also
provide a reform of commercial courts to enable a comprehensive, more efficient processing
of the most important cases.
Improving the functioning of the labor market
The Rebsamen Law on social dialogue modernization will increase the effectiveness of social
dialogue at firm level by rationalizing the rules, adapting them to the size of the companies,
and giving companies greater leeway with regard to collective agreements. Social dialogue
will become simpler and of higher quality, with a reduction of the effect of thresholds related
to the number of employees.
After the staff visit, the Government also announced in early June a Small Businesses Act in
order to boost employment and activity, with measures to improve flexibility and security

4
(job retention agreements), to enhance job creation (strong financial incentives for first job
creation), to allow renewal of fixed-term contracts two times instead of one and to cut legal
uncertainty on individual dismissals costs (prud’hommes).
Overall impact of structural reforms
Reforms are starting to yield positive results, and have an impact on growth potential. The
Government estimates that the reforms implemented since 2012 and to be adopted by the end
of the year will have a positive impact of about 4 points of GDP by 2020, with significant
impact starting in 2015 and 2016. Consistently, the OECD estimated the impact of several
reforms decided between 2012 and 2014 to have a positive impact of 3 points of GDP at a
10-year horizon.
4. Financial sector
Staff’s report rightly highlights the potential build-up of risks in the financial sector due to
the low interest rate environment. However, while these risks exist and should be closely
monitored, they are not specific to the French financial sector. Regarding insurers, French
average guaranteed rates are relatively low, in most cases based on an annual revisable
commitment, and the total duration gap is not of significant size compared to peers.
French banks have achieved strong progress towards meeting Basel III requirements, as
underlined in the report. Regarding risk weights, it should be noted that the in depth
assessment of the AQR has not lead to significant revision, suggesting that current RWA
calculation is well grounded and prudent. French banks have reduced their dependence to
short term wholesale funding: their loan–to-deposit ratio has decreased, in particular thanks
to an increase in deposits, since 2008, following an adjustment of their funding model.
Regulated savings deposits and accounts play a key role in encouraging a stable pool of
savings. Regarding their returns, the French authorities acknowledge the importance of
having regulated interest rates consistent with an efficient transmission of ECB monetary
policy. In this respect, the guaranteed interest rate on the housing savings plan (Plan Epargne
Logement) was recently cut.
