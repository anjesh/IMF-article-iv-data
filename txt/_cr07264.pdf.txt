Staff Report for the 2007 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2007 Consultation with the United States

Approved by Anoop Singh and Carlo Cottarelli

•

Scope and focus. Given the economic slowdown and concern about spillovers from the
housing market and subprime delinquencies, a key topic of the discussions was prospects for
a soft landing. Beyond this near-term issue, the focus was on improving financial sector
regulation, resolving external imbalances, and achieving fiscal sustainability. Trade policy,
aid, and anti-money-laundering initiatives were also covered (Table 1).

•

Outlook. The baseline anticipates moderate below-trend growth of 2 percent in 2007 and a
pickup to 2¾ percent in 2008. However, housing market weakness, tighter credit conditions,
and slower productivity growth could all hold back recovery.

• Monetary policy. Current policy settings are consistent with a soft landing and core inflation
of under 2 percent. However, tight labor markets and other inflation risks justify caution in
lowering interest rates unless activity weakens rapidly.
• Financial sector. Innovation under an “originate to distribute” business model has helped
disperse risk and raise capital adequacy of core institutions. But with benign market
conditions encouraging risk-taking, lending standards may be falling. Less fragmented and
more principles- and risk-based supervision can raise resilience.
• Current account. The large deficit has been easily financed, reflecting the attractiveness of
U.S. financial markets. However, markets are not factoring in the significant depreciation
likely associated with rebalancing demand and adjusting portfolios, and an abrupt dollar
adjustment and financial market turbulence are risks for the global economy. Policies to
encourage U.S. saving agreed at the Fund’s Multilateral Consultation could reduce this
vulnerability, including through further fiscal adjustment.
• Fiscal policy. Deficit reduction has exceeded expectations, but the main fiscal challenge is to
address unsustainable increases in entitlement spending from rising medical costs and
population aging. Reform of the Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security programs should be
complemented by improvements to the medical system, more ambitious medium-term
consolidation, and an overhaul of the tax system.

•

Analytical work. Background studies analyze the size and sources of U.S. real spillovers,
global bond market linkages, financing of the current account deficit, innovation in the
financial system, evolution of the subprime mortgage market, recent buoyancy of federal
revenues, and use of GFSM 2001 accounting standards (see Selected Issues).

I. PROSPECTS FOR A SOFT LANDING1
A. Overview
1.
The U.S. economy has cooled more than expected over the past year, but
employment remains strong and growth abroad has picked up. Following an extended
boom led by strong domestic demand, the slowdown has largely reflected a drag from
residential investment as housing market activity has fallen rapidly. Unexpected weakness in
business investment and net exports, as well as an inventory correction, amplified the
downturn in early 2007, although indicators suggest a recovery is underway. Private
consumption has continued to grow robustly as solid growth in wage earnings has minimized
spillovers from housing, unemployment has remained extremely low, and, as a result, core
inflation has only recently started to ease. The global environment remains favorable, with
robust growth in the Euro area and Asia.
2.
The most likely scenario is a soft landing of the U.S. economy. Officials agreed with
staff that there would probably be a gradual acceleration in final domestic demand growth in
2007 as the slowdown in the housing market and associated drag from residential investment
lessens, consumption decelerates mildly,

recessions, even though indicators such as
unemployment and real interest rates are
more favorable. The upside potential from

B. Financial Conditions and Developments
4.
Underlying the baseline forecast of a soft landing is the continuation of supportive
financial conditions, even after the emergence of problems with subprime mortgages.
Rising subprime delinquencies led to a jump in spreads on higher-risk mortgage-backed
securities, but there has yet been little contagion outside of the near prime (“Alt-A”) segment
of the mortgage market, reflecting the wide dispersion of risk and concentration of
difficulties in specialist subprime originators, many of which have failed (Box 1). Recently,
long-term yields and spreads have risen on stronger growth expectations and associated
inflationary concerns. Despite this latest episode of modest volatility, financing conditions
remain easy and spreads low by historical standards (Figure A).

6
Box 1: The Subprime Shakeout
This box summarizes some of the main issues arising from the subprime shakeout and its potential impact on the
housing market and household spending (for further details see Selected Issues Chapter V).
Size. The origination of subprime loans increased substantially in 2005-06, reaching about 20 percent of all new
mortgages. While estimates vary, at end-2006 subprime loans probably made up 12-15 percent of outstanding U.S.
mortgages, with near-prime (“Alt-A”) constituting another 10 percent. This pace was maintained by sharply reducing
lending standards, such that many 2006 borrowers would need substantial house price appreciation in order to refinance
once their rates reset.
Impact thus far. As shown in the accompanying figure, early payment defaults and delinquencies on recent subprime
adjustable rate mortgage (ARM) vintages have risen sharply, while total foreclosures have almost doubled in the year to
May 2007. Spreads on lower-rated tranches of

of the riskier tranches of ABS and CDOs
exposed to 2006 loans. Despite lending standards
tightening sharply, issuance of ABSs backed by subprime loans is continuing, albeit down from 2006. There is little
evidence thus far of spillovers to delinquencies on prime mortgages or other forms of consumer credit, with spreads on
assets backed by prime mortgages, auto loans, and credit card debt remaining low.
Baseline forecast. With growth in, and access to, home equity already curtailed by stalling house prices and tightening
lending standards, subprime delinquencies are expected to rise further, especially as the majority of hybrid ARM resets
to higher interest rates are due for late 2007 and early 2008. However, the estimated additional $43 billion in interest
costs in 2007 is small relative to total interest costs or consumption. Rising foreclosures are also likely to lengthen the
housing cycle and cause hardship in specific localities and minority communities.
Risks. If mounting troubles in the subprime segment dent broader consumer confidence, there could be a
disproportionate impact on consumption. Analysts have noted that tightening lending standards could be exacerbated if
Congress, federal regulators, or the States enact severe anti-predatory lending rules. Currently, however, most attention
is being given to encourage loan servicers to modify conditions to enable subprime borrowers to stay in their homes.

5.
At the same time, innovation based on an “originate to distribute” model is
reshaping the financial sector. As detailed in Selected Issues Chapter IV, the income of
institutions at the core of the financial system, the commercial and investment banks,
increasingly derives from bundling and servicing securitized assets for investors—assetbacked securities and collateralized debt/loan obligations (CDOs/CLOs)—rather than from
holding loans. The system has thus evolved to yield: (i) a profitable and well-capitalized core
relatively protected from credit risks; (ii) an innovative and lightly-regulated periphery,
including specialized institutions that originate loans and a multitude of hedge funds that
support market liquidity and price discovery; and (iii) the transfer and diversification of
credit risk via a wider range of securitized assets and credit derivatives. Against this rapidly
changing financing landscape, U.S. markets have remained globally pre-eminent and robust
to a range of shocks (Figure 1).
6.
The originate-to-distribute model, however, could be exacerbating incentive
problems in financial markets. The intermediaries at various stages of the process—
originators, securitizers, and pool managers—are remunerated primarily through fees and
often bear only limited long-term balance sheet exposure to the underlying assets. This can
reduce their incentives to maintain loan quality. The problem has been exacerbated by strong
appetite for higher-yielding CDOs/CLOs, which has boosted investor demand for higher-risk
loans even as these structured products have become more complex. In hindsight, the losses
incurred on bundled subprime mortgage securities indicate that rating agencies and investors
underestimated the weakening of lending standards and its impact in 2005–06.
7.
Staff see parallels to subprime mortgage developments in other market segments,
including leveraged loans. In particular, the boom in leveraged buyouts is being funded
through CLOs which have been in high demand from investors, and there is evidence that
covenants in the underlying loans have eased. A turn in the credit cycle, especially if
volatility and risk aversion rise, could expose financial vulnerabilities and unanticipated risk
concentrations, with adverse effects on activity. Staff analysis suggests that an unexpected
1 percentage point increase in corporate paper spreads would reduce real GDP by almost
½ percentage point over one year. Officials agreed that rising corporate indebtedness in
recent leveraged buyouts and the easing of loan covenants were a concern, but emphasized
the strength of corporate and financial sector balance sheets.
C. Housing and Household Spending
8.
The drag from residential investment is likely to dissipate gradually (Figure 2). As
the housing market has cooled rapidly and prices have stalled and even started to fall in
several cities, residential investment has declined rapidly, subtracting about 1 percentage
point from growth since the spring of 2006. With housing starts falling below trend,
inventory stabilizing, and builders cutting prices, the share of residential investment in GDP
has moved back toward historical averages and the drag on growth should moderate. Staff
suggested that the subprime shakeout, with attendant foreclosures and tightening of mortgage

9
lending standards, could further delay recovery in the housing market. Officials agreed that
the rapid expansion of the subprime mortgage market had extended the housing boom, but
felt that current sub- and near-prime mortgage market problems were manageable, given that
distress was concentrated in areas with weak economies and in recent adjustable rate
subprime mortgages.
9.
Private consumption has proven resilient to the housing market correction and is
expected to remain solid (Figure B). Consumption grew at a robust 3¼ percent in 2006
despite a weaker housing market as household saving remained negative. Indicators have
remained solid into the second quarter of 2007 despite high gasoline prices, supported by a
steady labor market, continuing income growth, and low long-term interest rates. Rising
equity prices have maintained a near-record household wealth-to-income ratio despite the
drag on wealth from the sharp slowdown in house prices. Staff agreed with officials that
consumption continued to be above its long-term equilibrium value, and its growth would
likely moderate as the impact of slower house price appreciation reduces the wealth-income
ratio, allowing some modest recovery in household saving.
10.
Nevertheless, there is a risk of more immediate spillovers from the housing market
to personal spending (Figure 3). Staff noted that tighter mortgage lending standards in the
wake of subprime problems and higher mortgage rates could add to pressure on household
finances already affected by slowing housing wealth. Officials were more sanguine about the
implications of tighter lending, which they saw as largely confined to the sub- and nearprime segment of the market—borrowers that accounted for a relatively small part of
aggregate consumption. They agreed, however, that the housing market would be a
significant risk for consumption if slower activity undermined employment and income
growth.
D. Prospects for Business Investment
11.
Business fixed investment is projected to recover from recent weakness as strong
fundamentals reassert themselves. After expanding solidly during 2003–06, spending on
fixed investment slowed rapidly beginning in the last quarter of 2006, although recent
leading indicators suggest a revival (Figure 4). The deceleration was faster than explained by
fundamentals and temporary factors, such as problems in the automobile and construction
sectors and the impact of tighter 2007 emission limits on truck purchases. Officials noted that
business contacts remained upbeat and emphasized the strength of corporate balance sheets,
as firms had used the payoffs from cost containment to restructure through mergers, return
equity to shareholders, and reduced leverage to well below pre-2001 recession levels
notwithstanding the spate of leveraged buyouts by private equity funds (Figure 5).

Nevertheless, there remains uncertainty about prospects for business investment.
Officials observed that since the underlying causes of the weakness in business spending
were not fully understood, the anticipated recovery was also not assured. Officials saw much
of the recent productivity slowdown as cyclical in nature, and were confident that underlying
productivity growth would remain solid on continued strong IT investment. Still, most
analysts, the staff, and the authorities had marked down medium-term growth prospects on
data revisions suggesting slower historical productivity growth. It was agreed that if slowing
productivity turned out to imply a further reduction in potential growth, lower expected
future income could reduce support for domestic demand, including business investment. In
addition, staff expressed concern that financing conditions could tighten unexpectedly. The
rise in long-term bond yields, volatility, and spreads in June/July 2007 illustrates the
potential for a reversal to less supportive and more historically typical financing conditions.
E. Inflation Outlook
13.
Core inflation is likely to continue to ease (Figure 6). While headline inflation has
been dominated by energy price changes, core personal consumption expenditure (PCE)
inflation—the Fed’s preferred measure—has eased gradually, falling to 1.9 percent (year-onyear) in May; as is typical, the CPI measure is somewhat higher. Officials expected core
measures to continue to drift downwards, drawn by the gravitational pull of well-anchored
inflation expectations (most measures are consistent with expected PCE inflation of below
2 percent), less pressure from commodity prices (where the pass-through is largely
complete), slowing shelter prices as the housing market cools (the catch up of rents to past
house price increases has been an important recent driver of core inflation), and, to a lesser
extent, growing economic slack.
14.
Risks to inflation are slightly to the upside. Staff and officials agreed that there were
potential cost pressures from recent rises in compensation, slower productivity growth, and
the uptick in oil prices. While high profit margins provide a cushion against pass-through of
these cost increases, Fed officials cautioned that the tight labor market could yield
accelerating unit labor costs and lead to inflationary pressure (Figure 7).
F. Funding the U.S. Current Account Deficit
15.
Continued easy funding of the current account deficit reflects liquid and innovative
U.S. bond markets (Figure C). As discussed in Chapter III of the Selected Issues paper, net
financing has come almost entirely from fixed income instruments. In addition to emerging
market inflows, lower home bias and a global switch toward buying private bonds, where the
U.S. represents over half the global market and dominates issuance of securitized assets, help
explain the ready demand and lack of an apparent exchange rate risk premium, suggesting a
significant structural element to capital inflows. Officials emphasized that the ability of U.S.

markets to create a wide array of liquid assets supports financing, while low global real
interest rates and tight spreads have limited funding costs.
16.
At unchanged real exchange rates, the current account deficit is projected to
narrow only slightly. The deficit stabilized at 6 percent of GDP in 2006, with a stronger
nonoil trade balance (of some ¼ percent of GDP) partly offset by the impact of higher oil
prices and lower net investment income (Figure 8). Staff and officials agreed that exports
would improve on strong global demand, and are an upside to the forecast. However, without
further exchange rate changes, the improvement in the nonoil balance would remain modest
under the soft landing scenario, as stronger U.S. activity raises imports. The falling income
balance would also limit the medium-term improvement in the current account deficit.
17.
Staff noted, however, that the associated decline in the U.S. net foreign asset
position implies long-term real depreciation Real dollar depreciation of some 15 percent
since 2002 has had only a limited impact on the trade balance, possibly reflecting a shift in
trade shares toward lower-cost producers (Figure 9). Nevertheless, massive valuation gains,
partly reflecting depreciation against industrial currencies such as the euro, have maintained
U.S. net foreign liabilities at under 20 percent of GDP in recent years. Staff and Fed officials
agreed that the upward trend would likely resume given continued large current account
deficits, with the magnitude depending on the dollar’s evolution. According to staff analysis
by the Consultative Group on Exchange Rates (CGER), further real effective dollar
depreciation of 10–30 percent would be required to eliminate the misalignment relative to
medium-term macroeconomic fundamentals. Even taking account of capital market
fundamentals, in particular the attractiveness of U.S. financial assets, inflows will likely
diminish over time as portfolio demand is satisfied, implying a lower long-term value for the
dollar.
18.
Officials were skeptical about the notion of overvaluation for a market-determined
currency such as the dollar. While they understood the basis for staff’s calculations, they
stressed that the underlying CGER models failed adequately to factor in nontrade
fundamentals such as capital flows. They emphasized that long-term real interest rate
differentials continued to signal little market concern about large or disorderly dollar
depreciation (Figure 10). Staff agreed that implied volatilities for deep out-of-the money
options on the dollar suggest that markets assign a low probability to a sharp change but
observed that, precisely because it would be unexpected, a sharp fall could spark turbulence.
II. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
19.
The discussions focused on policies to mitigate risks to U.S.—and global—
macroeconomic stability and growth. Beyond the near-term issue of calibrating monetary
policy to facilitate a soft landing, discussions centered on improving financial market
regulation and ensuring long-term fiscal sustainability. Competitive financial markets have
been central to the easy funding of large U.S. current account deficits, and desk analysis

14
suggests that spillovers elsewhere are also largely transmitted through financial channels.
The key fiscal challenge is reforming unsustainable entitlement programs, particularly in the
area of health care.
A. Monetary Policy
20.
The current monetary stance is appropriate and consistent with a soft landing and
a gradual moderation of inflation. On signs of slowing growth, and with inflationary
expectations well anchored, the Fed stopped tightening in June 2006 despite still
uncomfortably high headline inflation (Figure D). Staff and officials agreed that the current
federal funds rate of 5¼ percent is “mildly restrictive” and has led to a welcome reduction in
core inflation as growth has fallen below trend. Officials saw the persistent divergence
between market expectations of policy easing and the Fed’s inflation concerns as reflecting
differences in view on the outlook, with market participants unconvinced that a soft landing
could be achieved without monetary loosening. More recently, market expectations have
moved in line with Fed views, and rate cuts are no longer anticipated in 2007.
21.
Fed officials expressed concern over inflation. Given the stickiness in core inflation,
staff and officials agreed that the expected deceleration in inflation was by no means assured.
Officials underscored that under their “risk management approach,” which takes into account
both the likelihood and the disruptiveness of outcomes, upside inflation surprises remained
the Federal Open Markets Committee’s (FOMC’s) dominant policy concern as they could
feed through to inflation expectations, which would be socially costly. Nevertheless,
monetary policy would respond to further significant unexpected weakening of the economy
or tightening of financial conditions.
22.
Improvements in the Fed’s communications strategy should bolster its ability to
comply with its dual mandate of price stability and full employment. Staff observed that
quantifying the Fed’s longer-term inflation objective might help further anchor expectations.
Officials responded that, while individual members may have expressed personal opinions,
there was no collective FOMC view on the appropriate range for inflation. In addition, a
possible inflation objective was only one facet of the evolving communication strategy. A
commission led by Vice Chairman Kohn was discussing possible improvements, including
the dialogue with markets, Congress, and the general public. Given that changes in
communications were generally not reversible and could affect governance, they were best
introduced gradually, much as the FOMC had experimented with faster approval of minutes
for a year before advancing their publication.

system are high by international standards. In particular, for large bank holding companies,
the reduced interest margins from low long-term interest rates and a flat-to-slightly-inverted
yield curve have been more than offset by rising fee income and near record-low defaults.
Reflecting this, and despite a recent uptick following subprime difficulties, market measures
of default risk have remained benign.
24.
Federal prudential oversight rightly focuses on depository institutions and
systemically important investment banks. Officials emphasized that depository institutions
benefit uniquely from deposit insurance and access to the Fed’s discount window, and that
the associated moral hazard justifies prudential regulation; in other areas, however, market
discipline is the better regulator of risk.
25.

Even so, financial innovation, has led to new regulatory challenges:

•

Systemic risks from tail events. Staff suggested that, while recent financial developments
have helpfully spread risk, the impact of an extremely adverse market outcome may have
risen. This is because low market volatility has increased incentives to adopt aggressive
and leveraged trading strategies that often assume liquid underlying markets, including in
newer derivatives and asset-backed securities. As discussed in the April 2007 editions of
the Global Financial Stability Report and the Bank of England’s Financial Stability
Report, a sudden rise in risk aversion could uncover unanticipated vulnerabilities,
illiquidity in newer markets, and major losses in asset values.

•

Managing counterparty risks. Officials shared the concerns regarding increasing
systemic risks from a tail event, but argued that private markets, including core
institutions, are better placed than regulators to manage their exposures to highly
leveraged hedge funds. In particular, they suggested that these risks could be handled
through a combination of market discipline, investor due diligence, and systematic risk
management, as outlined by the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets. While
agreeing with this approach, staff were concerned about whether adequate due
diligence—including of exposures of the core to hedge funds—was possible with limited
hedge fund disclosure, whether risk management systems were sufficiently robust to a
shock with consequences across a range of markets and if, given likely shifts in the
investor base for hedge funds, consumer protection issues would become more pertinent.

•

Agency ratings. Staff observed that credit rating agencies are playing an increasingly
important role in how complex financial products are structured, which could involve
potential conflicts of interest in that rating agencies have an interest in facilitating
continuing investor appetite for such products to generate fees. Concerns have also been
raised about whether all investors understand differences in underlying risks (products
with similar ratings often have divergent spreads) and about the slow response of CDO
ratings to problems in the subprime market (although there were a number of downgrades
in June/July 2007). Officials responded that last year’s Credit Rating Agency Reform Act

18
aimed at limiting conflicts of interest and increasing competition in the industry. As
detailed regulations to implement the Act are still being finalized, it is too early to assess
its success.
•

Consumer protection. Fed officials explained that, in light of the subprime shakeout,
they are examining whether regulations implementing the Truth in Lending Act could be
modified to address concerns of predatory lending, including by nonbanks that are not
covered by guidance from federal regulators. Staff supported these efforts, but suggested
that, given the importance of state-registered nonbanks in originating mortgages, federal
legislation might also be needed to improve the consistency of enforcement.

26.
A fragmented regulatory system hampers the response to these challenges. Staff
emphasized the disadvantages of a complex system of overlapping regulatory oversight in a
rapidly changing financial landscape, noting that it could delay responses to important
prudential matters, such as guidance on hybrid subprime mortgages and the implementation
of the Basel II framework. While officials acknowledged that the regulatory structure
reflected a complex history, they observed that it supports greater deliberation and
specialization among regulators. Looking forward, the goal is to move to a more risk-based
approach to regulation guided by overarching principles, as recommended by the President’s
Working Group, which would increase consistency across regulators and their flexibility in
responding to innovation.
27.
The Treasury has recently announced it will study options to streamline the current
financial regulatory system. Staff pointed to the work of the Government Accountability
Office (GAO), which had earlier developed a number of useful reform options, including the
merger of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodities and Futures
Trading Commission whose responsibilities overlapped (Selected Issues Chapter IV
discusses these and other reform options). However, observers have noted that rationalization
could involve difficulties, in part reflecting the current structure of Congressional oversight
of federal agencies.
28.
Staff reiterated their support for proposals to improve regulatory effectiveness
(Table 1). These included: instituting a national insurance charter (to reduce compliance
costs with state-by-state regulation); reforming oversight of government-sponsored housing
enterprises (to limit systemic risks from their portfolios); and modifying the industrial loan
company charter (to avoid deposit-taking without consolidated supervision). Staff also
suggested that publishing a Financial Stability Report could further improve communication
with market participants.
29.
The Administration has emphasized safeguarding the competitiveness of U.S.
financial markets (Figure 11). In addition to regulatory cost and complexity, concerns
centered on litigiousness in U.S. financial markets given existing tort procedures and the
associated vulnerability of the highly-concentrated audit industry (where firms are currently

19
required to be structured as unlimited private partnerships rather than limited liability
companies). Staff welcomed recent initiatives to lower the cost of regulation, including SEC
rules making it easier for foreign companies to deregister from U.S. exchanges and providing
clearer guidance on Sarbanes-Oxley Section 404 that deals with company internal financial
controls, which would lower compliance costs, particularly for small firms. The SEC’s
decision to consider recognition of some foreign regulators and international accounting
standards would also improve domestic and international market efficiency.
30.
U.S. financial markets remain highly innovative, supporting capital inflows and
long-term growth. Officials noted that some loss of market share is to be expected with
capital market development abroad. Despite the attention given to lost market share in areas
such as initial public offerings by foreign firms, initiatives to support market competitiveness
are mainly a preemptive strategy to ensure U.S. markets remain globally preeminent.
31.
The proposed Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) will start in late 2009.
Officials explained that the need to formulate new rules to implement the Basel II
framework, which was already behind schedule, precludes an earlier start date.
C. External Imbalances and International Spillovers
32.
Staff underlined the importance of U.S. financial market conditions and soundness
to global activity. Following work in the latest World Economic Outlook, desk analysis finds
that significant spillovers from U.S. activity to other countries operate mainly through
financial markets (rather than trade channels), and with little reverse causation (Figure F,
Box 2, and Selected Issues Chapter I). As recessions have a markedly greater impact on U.S.
financial conditions than mid-cycle slowdowns, these results help explain why U.S.
recessions have historically had more-than-proportional effects on foreign activity.
33.
While a disorderly resolution of global imbalances remains a low probability event,
the costs would be extremely high. Staff and officials agreed that the rebalancing of U.S.
demand from foreign to domestic goods was likely to occur gradually given strong foreign
demand for U.S. assets. Nevertheless, staff observed that a more abrupt adjustment was
possible and would be highly damaging if it involved a flight from dollar assets that led to
broader financial market disruption. Officials responded that event studies suggest that even
an abrupt exchange rate adjustment, which they considered unlikely, need not imply
disorderly markets if macroeconomic policies were sound. That said, they acknowledged that
the uniqueness of the current situation—a large deficit in the country at the center of the
international monetary system—might limit the value of such comparisons.

20

Box 2. Size and Sources of U.S. Spillovers Abroad
This Box summarizes desk analysis on the size and sources of output spillovers across the major
industrial regions—the United States, the euro area, Japan, and an aggregate group of small industrial
countries (see also Selected Issues Chapter I).
An issue in earlier work on U.S. spillovers has been separating the impact of global and regional
shocks given the high correlation of economic cycles. This analysis uses disturbances to a diverse group
of small industrial countries (Australia, Canada, Denmark, Norway, New Zealand, Sweden, and
Switzerland) as a proxy for global shocks. Vector autoregressions using real GDP growth for the four
regions—the United States, the euro area, Japan, and other industrial countries—were used to measure
the size of global and regional spillovers, while sources of spillovers were studied by adding data on real
net exports, commodity prices, and financial variables (short- and long-term interest rates and equity
prices) to this baseline model.
The results suggest that:
•

Shocks to the United States have significant implications for growth in all other regions. The
spillovers are roughly ¼ to ½ as large as the disturbance in U.S. growth, with the impact building
gradually over a two year horizon (see Figure F). This finding is robust to alternative orderings of
the regions, with only spillovers to the rest of the world showing noticeable variation, reflecting a
lingering contemporaneous correlation between U.S. and global shocks. By contrast, while the
United States responds to global disturbances, it is relatively unaffected by shocks from the Euro
area or Japan.

•

U.S. spillovers to foreign output are largely transmitted through financial channels. The analysis

These results support the finding in the latest

in recessions than mid-cycle slowdowns. This
is because U.S. financial conditions have
typically tightened rapidly in the run-up to
recessions than milder slowdowns in activity
(Figure).

Staff welcomed the Administration’s focus on policies to support national savings
and stressed the role of fiscal consolidation in reducing the current account deficit. This
commitment, which has been reaffirmed as part of a shared responsibility of key members to
address global imbalances in the context of the Multilateral Consultation (MC), would lower
the risks of a disorderly resolution of global imbalances (Table 2). Officials responded that
the U.S. fiscal deficit had improved much faster than expected during the past two years,
obstacles to automatic enrollment in defined-contribution pension plans had been eliminated,
and proposals to enhance tax incentives for household savings had been presented in the
latest budget. They also noted that the MC had been useful in reaching shared technical
understandings among the participants and engagement with them.
35.
The authorities restated their commitment to resisting rising protectionism. Staff
underscored the importance of maintaining an open trading system and offering a larger
reduction in the ceiling of U.S. agricultural subsidies to catalyze an ambitious outcome to the
Doha Round. They also suggested that greater support to those temporarily dislocated by
rising imports could help ameliorate the impact of trade on workers, and thereby help resist
pressure for higher tariffs. Officials emphasized the Administration’s “absolute commitment”
to openness and progress in the Doha round. They were confident that the President’s Trade
Promotion Authority, a crucial underpinning for completing the Doha Round that expired on
July 1, could be renewed if needed. However, they did not see a case for expanding specific
support for workers displaced by trade separate from the regular social safety net given the
difficulties of identifying the reason that workers had lost jobs.
D. Achieving Fiscal Sustainability
36.
Short-run fiscal developments continue to be favorable (Figure 12). The
Administration’s goal of halving the deficit by FY 2009 was achieved three years ahead of
schedule, with the unified deficit falling below 2 percent of GDP in FY 2006. The FY 2007
deficit is again likely to significantly outperform expectations and move below 1½ percent of
GDP. This success reflects both revenue buoyancy (as profits and capital gains surged) and
lower-than-budgeted expenditures.
37.
Staff welcomed the strong fiscal outcomes but cautioned that the strength of
revenues seen in recent years could be partly temporary. Outperformance since FY 2004
has largely reflected unexpected revenue buoyancy, three-quarters of which is attributable to
high corporate profits and capital gains revenues, with much of the remainder explained by
rising inequality (Selected Issues Chapter VI). Given risks to growth and the apparent
slowing of profit growth, it is not clear that revenue buoyancy will persist into FY 2008.

Sources: FY 2008 Budget of the U.S. Government (February 5, 2007); and Fund staff estimates.
1/ Staff projections are based on the Administration's budget adjusted for: differences in macroeconomic projections;
staff estimates of the cost of ongoing operations in Iraq; some additional non-defense discretionary expenditure;
additional Medicare spending; and continued AMT relief beyond FY 2008. PRAs are also assumed not to be introduced.

38.
The Administration aims to balance the budget by FY 2012 while making
permanent the 2001/03 tax cuts, but achieving this goal will be difficult. Officials
emphasized that spending restraint would be key to achieving their target, given the
importance of preserving the benefits of lower tax rates. Staff welcomed the Administration’s
commitment to a deficit reduction target and Congress’ decision to adopt this target in its
own budget resolution, supported by pay-as-you-go rules in both chambers. However,
Congress envisages a rather different strategy involving less spending compression while
allowing most of the 2001/03 tax cuts to expire (extension of the tax cuts lowers revenue in
the baseline by some 1 percent of GDP from FY 2011). Given this lack of consensus, as well
as the fact that neither set of projections accounts fully for war costs or, more importantly,
for Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) relief beyond FY 2008 (costed at around ½ percent of
GDP annually), staff project the deficit remaining above 1 percent of GDP through FY 2012.
39.
Entitlement reform is vital to long-term budget sustainability, and early action
would reduce the cost of needed adjustment (Figure G). Congressional Budget Office
(CBO) projections imply that, under current policies, net federal spending on Medicare,
Medicaid, and Social Security as a ratio to GDP will more than double to some 17 percent of
GDP a year by 2050, driven by health spending. Officials emphasized that the
Administration’s reform proposals had been held back by limited political support. Staff and
officials agreed that including an analysis of long-term sustainability in budget documents—
an alternative discussed by the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board—would help
increase awareness of the challenge posed by rising costs of public health and pension
programs. (Selected Issues Chapter VII applies GFS 2001 accounting to the U.S. fiscal data.)

1/ Reform includes progressive indexation of Social Security; structural measures to facilitate cuts in Medicare provider payments as
per the Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) mechanism; and the President's FY 2008 budget proposals for Medicare. The baseline
assumes that Medicare provider payments grow with the Medicare Economic Index.

25
40.
The Administration has proposed reductions in Medicare spending by further
linking contributions to income and reducing provider payments. Staff strongly endorsed
budgetary proposals on contributions as an important step. However, it may be difficult to
lower provider payments, since cuts already required in the Medicare legislation are
regularly overturned. The Medicare Trustees have estimated that a more realistic path for
payments would increase projected long-term costs for physicians and outpatient services by
25–40 percent. In Medicaid, the main option is reducing long-term care costs—that comprise
around half of national spending—through better targeting of services.
41.
Medicare and Medicaid cannot be sustainably reformed without broader measures
to improve the effectiveness of medical spending (Figure 13). CBO staff emphasized that
rapidly increasing health care costs are a more important driver of future entitlement
spending costs than aging. Treasury officials observed that the problem is multifaceted and
requires a range of measures, including more appropriate price signals, improved pay-forperformance schemes, better use of information technology, and enhanced information for
both consumers and doctors. Staff and officials agreed that further analysis, preferably
coordinated in the public sector, is needed to better understand underlying health cost drivers
and achieve greater consensus on reform options.
42.
The latest budget proposals to eliminate the tax bias toward employer-provided
coverage would help to control national health costs. Replacing the uncapped tax break for
employer-provided health insurance with a standard deduction for all would reduce
incentives for “gold plated” schemes, complementing earlier tax incentives for highdeductible coverage. While agreeing that fostering individual responsibility could lower
costs, staff observed that the gains might be limited given most medical spending stems from
chronic and catastrophic cases and emphasized the importance of strengthening the
individual insurance market. Officials acknowledged these concerns and responded that the
Administration is allowing states to redirect some federal funds to support experiments to
broaden coverage, which would provide insights about the efficacy of different approaches.
43.
With Social Security cost drivers and reform options well understood, the priority is
achieving consensus on specific proposals. Staff observed that progressive indexation, in
which benefits for the wealthy are slowed gradually while those for the poor are protected,
could form the basis for a reform package. Officials emphasized that the Administration is
open to proposals and has invited discussion of reform options without preconditions.
44.
A more ambitious medium-term fiscal consolidation would better prepare for rising
entitlement costs, while also helping to reduce the current account deficit. Entitlement
spending is likely to put substantial pressure on the future size of general government
(Figure 14). Staff analysis suggests that even if medical inflation is slowed and substantial
entitlement reform achieved, long-term fiscal sustainability would require a more stringent
fiscal target—for instance, balancing the budget excluding the Social Security surplus. Such
a stance would put debt on a clearly declining path and offer room to maneuver in

26
responding to long-term challenges. Officials responded that budget balance by FY 2012 is
appropriately ambitious, and that further adjustment would be largely irrelevant given the
size of long-term entitlement pressures.
45.
Spending restraint is critical to deficit reduction, but revenue increases may also
need to be considered. Staff acknowledged the incentive benefits of the 2001/03 tax cuts, but
noted that these are partly offset by crowding out through higher government debt and real
interest rates. With nonsecurity discretionary spending as a ratio to GDP moving to historical
lows, revenue increases may be needed to support ambitious fiscal consolidation.
46.
The tax system is in any case in need of reform given its extensive exemptions and
high marginal tax rates. Income tax expenditures are over one-third of revenues, with
deductions for employers’ health insurance and mortgage interest alone accounting for
1¾ percent of GDP annually. The 2005 Presidential panel on tax reform provided a useful
blueprint to eliminate some deductions (state and local tax payments) and better target others
(mortgage interest relief), while supporting personal saving. This could usefully be
augmented by higher energy taxes, particularly as lower consumption would yield
environmental benefits. Officials noted that the Administration remains interested in
improving the efficiency of the tax system, but is constrained by a lack of political support,
and that the Administration’s energy policy emphasizes greater use of biofuels.
III. STAFF APPRAISAL
47.
The most likely scenario is a soft landing as growth recovers and inflation falls,
although both are subject to risks. Staff’s baseline forecast is for activity to pick up as the
drag from housing dissipates, business investment revives, and higher foreign growth
supports net exports. However, consumption could be weaker given the ongoing housing
market slowdown and benign financial market conditions could tighten. At the same time,
the expected decline in core inflation may not materialize if cost pressures from rising oil and
commodity prices and a tight labor market feed through to prices, despite the cushion
provided by wide profit margins.
48.
Current monetary policy is consistent with a soft landing and can be adjusted
flexibly in response to emerging macroeconomic developments. With inflation above the
Fed’s comfort level for some time and unemployment low, the FOMC has rightly
emphasized maintaining well-anchored inflation expectations. However, policymakers will
need to be alert to the speed with which employment and activity can weaken in a downturn.
49.
Financial innovation and stability have underpinned U.S. economic success and
funding of the current account deficit. The system has been highly resilient, including to
recent difficulties in the subprime mortgage market. Innovation has helped disperse risk, and
has been instrumental in attracting capital inflows, with foreigners increasingly buying U.S.
private sector debt securities.

27
50.
But rapid innovation has also created new regulatory challenges. Prudential
oversight should focus on core commercial and investment banks, while market discipline
limits risk-taking elsewhere. However, new instruments have made it more difficult to assess
risks at a time when benign market conditions have encouraged risk taking and lower lending
standards. Tightening financial conditions could expose unanticipated risk concentrations
and links across markets. This places a premium on supervisors’ ensuring that risk
management systems are robust to potential difficulties across a range of markets,
particularly for exposures of the core to hedge funds and other private pools of capital.
Problems with subprime mortgages also raise the challenge of ensuring consistent consumer
protection through federal rules without unduly constraining innovation.
51.
With several federal and many state regulators overseeing this evolving system, the
new emphasis on improving regulatory effectiveness is welcome. Shared responsibility can
encourage informed debate, but it also slows responses to pressing issues (e.g., to issuing
guidance on hybrid subprime loans and Basel II accord guidelines). Increased use of general
principles as a guide to rule making could ease interagency coordination and shorten reaction
times to innovation. We strongly support plans to study the scope for rationalizing the
regulatory structure, which can build on options earlier discussed by the GAO. Other
measures to improve regulatory effectiveness could include instituting a national insurance
charter, reforming oversight of government-sponsored housing enterprises, and modifying
the industrial loan company charter.
52.
Other initiatives to lower the costs of regulation and increase financial market
competitiveness will help retain the preeminence of U.S. financial markets. New guidance
will reduce the compliance burden of parts of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and new rules now
make it easier for foreign companies to delist from U.S. markets. We also welcome recent
moves by the Securities and Exchange Commission to consider recognizing international
accounting standards for foreign companies and to allow for mutual recognition of regulatory
regimes, which would improve market efficiency.
53.
A disorderly resolution of global imbalances remains a low probability—but high
cost—risk. The rebalancing of U.S. demand from foreign to domestic goods, and associated
real depreciation of the dollar and reduction in the current account deficit from an
unsustainable level will likely occur gradually given continuing strong demand for U.S.
financial assets. However, shocks could provoke a more abrupt elimination of the long-term
misalignment. A flight from dollar assets would risk disrupting U.S. financial markets, thus
lowering domestic demand and—via financial market spillovers abroad—foreign demand as
well. This highlights the importance of: (i) ensuring that U.S. financial markets remain sound
and innovative; and (ii) supporting U.S. saving, in particular by further reducing the fiscal
deficit, as agreed in the Multilateral Consultation.
54.
With the large current account deficit spawning initiatives to erect trade barriers,
we welcome the U.S. authorities’ commitment to free trade. A more ambitious agenda for
liberalizing agriculture could support a positive outcome to the Doha round of trade talks. In

28
addition, while globalization has undoubtedly raised aggregate welfare, it should be
recognized that it has also created winners and losers. Consideration could thus be given to
policies to aid workers temporarily dislocated by rising imports, which could also help
reduce protectionist sentiment.
55.
Recent fiscal performance and the adoption of a medium-term fiscal target are
commendable, but sustaining deficit reduction requires further political effort. Congress
has adopted the Administration’s target of budget balance by FY 2012 and passed supporting
pay-as-you-go rules. However, consensus on the means to achieve budgetary balance—
whether via tax- or spending-side measures—is lacking. Moreover, uncertain war funding
requirements and the cost of fixes to the Alternative Minimum Tax also will need to be taken
into account.
56.
The key fiscal challenge is reforming unsustainable entitlement programs. Rising
health costs and aging imply huge spending increases in Medicare, Medicaid, and, to a lesser
extent, Social Security:
•

Staff strongly endorse the Administration’s proposal to strengthen the link between
premiums and income as a first step to contain the costs to the budget of Medicare
spending, although further reforms will be needed.

•

Administration proposals such as removing the tax bias for employer-sponsored health
coverage could help reduce the high cost of U.S. health care but may need to be
complemented by more vigorous measures to bolster the individual insurance market.
More fundamental reform is necessary, and additional work is needed on underlying
medical cost drivers and policy options.

•

For Social Security, where the underlying costs and reform options are already well
understood, the priority now is to develop a consensus on the direction to take.
Progressive indexation is a promising approach.

57.
A more stringent medium-term target than the Administration’s would better
prepare for these spending pressures, while contributing to current account adjustment.
Balancing the budget excluding the Social Security surplus, for instance, would, by placing
government debt and associated interest costs on a clear downward trajectory, offer greater
room for maneuver in addressing future fiscal pressures on entitlement spending. The
implied structural improvement of slightly over ½ percent of GDP a year is achievable
without significant economic disruption.
58.
The reform of entitlement spending should be complemented with tax reform.
Depending on the progress that can be made in controlling spending, revenue increases may
also be needed. An overhaul of the complex tax system is in any case overdue. Proposals
contained in the President’s Advisory Panel on Tax Reform to reduce and better target writeoffs while further shielding saving from income taxes are an excellent starting point. This

29
could be augmented by other options, such as in the area of energy taxes, which would also
support environmental objectives.
59.
It is expected that the next Article IV consultation with the United States will be
held on the regular 12-month cycle.

A single, unified regulator should be established. The insurance
sector is of systemic importance, but state regulation results in
higher costs, regulatory arbitrage, and politically-driven
interference in local insurance markets.
As in many other industrialized countries, publication of an FSR
could improve markets' understanding of U.S. financial sector
risks and vulnerabilities and, potentially, facilitate greater
coordination amongst regulators.
Reduce tax disincentives to overfunding DB plans to bolster
cushions during market downturns; the Public Benefit Guaranty
Corporation (PGBC) should set risk-based premia; 'automatic'
enrollment in employer-sponsored DC plans should be facilitated.
Areas for improvement include, inter alia : (i) strengthening
customer due diligence; (ii) making corporate ownership
information more readily available; and (iii) extending AML/CFT
requirements to certain designated nonfinancial businesses and
professions.

Regulation of the insurance sector is entirely in the
hands of state Insurance Commissioners, with little
federal oversight.

The absence of a financial stability report (FSR).

The adequacy of savings for retirement could be
improved: many defined-benefit (DB) plans remain
underfunded, and weak incentives hamper employee
enrollment in defined-contribution (DC) plans.

As noted in the September 2006 AML/CFT ROSC,
the AML/CFT regime has strengthened significantly,
but there remain areas where compliance with FATF
recommendations could be tighter.

The September 2006 AML/CFT ROSC noted not only strong overall progress
since the last mutual evaluation in 1997, but also satisfactory compliance with
the FATF recommendations on enhanced due diligence for correspondent
banking relationships and requirements for money remittance services.

The Pension Protection Act of 2006 implemented many of these suggestions.

The Fed does not believe that the value added of an FSR--relative to what is
already being published by regulators and market participants--outweighs the
associated resource costs.

The Administration has suggested the need for a stronger federal role in
insurance regulation.

ILCs are, in essence, state-chartered banks, and are insured by the The FDIC has imposed a moratorium on applications for deposit insurance by
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). All bank owners
ILCs until January 2008. Differences in view among regulators about the need
should be subject to the same consolidated supervision provisions. to supervise nonfinancial corporate owners of ILCs remain.

There are concerns about the supervisory levelplaying field with regard to industrial finance
companies (ILCs). Unlike owners of commercial
banks, owners of ILCs are not subject to
consolidated supervision provisions under the Bank
Holding Company Act.

The Administration has worked toward passage of appropriate legislation. A
new draft bill, H.R. 1427, the “Federal Housing Finance Reform Act of 2007,"
was passed by the House Financial Services Committee in March 2007. It
gives a new regulator the power to restrict GSE investment portfolios but does
not require this.

Systemic risks could be reduced by imposing stricter capital
requirements on GSEs and measures to restore their focus on
securitization of conforming mortgages, including through limits
on their investment activities.

Investment portfolios of the government-sponsored
housing enterprises (GSEs) are so large that they
may pose systemic risks in the markets for prime
mortgages and interest rates derivatives.

Financial Policy

The U.S. is steadily increasing aid. Furthermore, overall assistance, including
remittances and other private capital flows (which are more important in the
U.S. than elsewhere), is higher.

U.S. ODA should be increased, in line with G-8 commitments to
increase aid to Africa, the Millennium Challenge Account, and
HIV/AIDS and malaria initiatives.

Official development assistance (ODA) as a percent
of GDP is lower in the U.S. than in most other
industrial countries.

Authorities’ Position

Proliferation of U.S. preferential trade agreements could
U.S. bilateral free trade agreements complement multilateral negotiations.
undermine the multilateral fabric of world trade unless the
agreements include open-access clauses and simple rules of origin.

Trade Policy and Foreign Aid

Staff Position

There are concerns about U.S. leadership in
advancing global trade liberalization.

45

Table 2. United States: Policy Progress and Plans Relevant to the IMFC
Strategy
Over the past year, developments in U.S. policies related to the IMFC strategy included:
•

Continued narrowing of the budget deficit. The unified federal budget deficit declined to 1.9
percent of GDP in FY 2006, a substantial decrease in two years, and on track to outperform
initial IMF staff expectations for FY 2007.

•

Passage of saving-focused tax reforms. Rate cuts for capital gains and dividends were
extended for two years, as were increased expensing of allowances for small businesses.
Enhancements to tax-advantaged retirement and education savings vehicles were made
permanent, and legal barriers to automatic enrollment in employer-sponsored retirement plans
were removed. The saver’s credit, aimed at low- and middle-income individuals, was also made
permanent. Finally, health savings accounts were made more attractive.

Looking forward, the U.S. authorities’ policy plans include the following:
•

Further fiscal consolidation over the medium term. The FY 2008 budget targets eliminating
the budget deficit by 2012.

•

Reforming the budget process to contain spending growth. The FY 2008 budget proposes
limits on the use of Congressional budget earmarks and authority for the President to exercise
a budget line-item veto.

•

Entitlement reform to strengthen long-term fiscal sustainability. Policies have been
proposed to slow the rate of growth of health care costs while expanding access to care,
including providing a standard deduction for health insurance and expanding the use of health
savings accounts.

•

Further tax incentives to support private saving. The FY 2008 budget promotes new taxadvantaged vehicles, replacing IRAs with Retirement Savings Accounts, and introducing
Lifetime Savings Accounts. Social Security reform with Personal Retirement Accounts is again
proposed.

•

Enhancing energy efficiency. Net oil imports amount to 35 percent of the U.S. trade balance.
The Administration is committed to cutting gasoline consumption by 20 percent in 10 years by
requiring 35 billion gallons of renewable and alternative fuels by 2017, and by increasing fuel
economy standards for cars and light trucks.

•

Pro-growth, open investment policies. The United States is committed to pro-growth policies
that make the United States an attractive location for foreign investment. Key elements include
a strong commitment to an open investment environment, resistance to protectionist pressures,
and a commitment to permanently low tax rates.

•

Capital market competitiveness. The Administration is actively engaged, through the U.S.
Treasury, in ways to improve U.S. legal, regulatory, and accounting frameworks and thus better
ensure that U.S. capital markets remain the strongest and most innovative in the world.

1/ Staff projections are based on the Administration's budget adjusted for: differences in macroeconomic projections;
staff estimates of the cost of ongoing operations in Iraq; some additional non-defense discretionary expenditure;
additional Medicare spending; and continued AMT relief beyond FY2008. PRAs are also assumed not to be introduced.
2/ As a percent of potential GDP, based on proposed measures, under IMF staff's economic
assumptions. Also incorporates CBO adjustments for one-off items.
3/ Calendar year, on a national accounts basis. The projections use Fund staff budget and economic assumptions.

1/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; ρ = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms, g = real GDP growth rate,
ε = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and α = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price changes is defined as [-ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock. ρ increases with a rising GDP deflator.
3/ Line includes the impact of exchange rate changes.
4/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
5/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the net foreign asset ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels
of the last projection year.

2/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + αε(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; α = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and ε = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as αε(1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period gross debt stock.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
July 27, 2007
1.
This note reports on information that has become available since the staff report
was issued and does not alter the staff appraisal.
2.
The Federal Reserve’s semi-annual Monetary Policy Report (MPR) was
presented to Congress on July 18–19 by Chairman Bernanke. The Chairman cautioned
that some of the recent easing in core inflation could be transitory, but expected this measure
to fall below 2 percent on a sustainable basis by 2008. He also indicated that economic
growth is likely to pick up modestly, from 2¼–2½ percent this year to 2½–2¾ percent in
2008 (both Q4 on Q4).
3.
The Administration has released its Mid-Session Review of the budget. The
projected FY 2007 deficit was marked down to 1½ percent of GDP, as anticipated in the
Staff Report, but projected future deficits were raised modestly due to higher anticipated
spending, mainly on Medicare/Medicaid. The changes are not large enough to warrant
revisions to the data in the Staff Report.
4.
Motivated by continued difficulties in the subprime mortgage market, regulators
are taking steps to strengthen consumer protection in mortgage lending. On July 17,
federal regulators announced a pilot project to cooperate with state regulators in checking
compliance with consumer protection regulations by (1) non-depository affiliates of
depository institutions and (2) by state-licensed mortgage lenders and brokers issuing
subprime mortgages. This follows the issuance of final guidance requiring depository
institutions to tighten lending standards to subprime adjustable rate mortgages. Federal
regulators also announced on July 20 an agreed strategy on Basel II implementation. The
agreement resolves major outstanding issues and should be followed by finalized rules
relatively soon.
5.
Recent data releases continue to point to easing inflation and moderate growth.
Core CPI inflation fell to 2.2 percent in June. Consumption growth has slowed and the
housing market remains weak. However, the data are more positive for other sectors:
industrial production increased by 0.5 percent in June, and May export growth was strong.
The flash second quarter GDP release is due the morning of the Board discussion.
6.
While subprime mortgage spreads continue to widen, financial market
conditions remain generally supportive of activity. Although high-yield corporate and
investment bank credit spreads have widened, they remain at historically low levels.
Meanwhile, U.S. equity markets have touched record highs.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2007 Article IV Consultation with the
United States
On July 27, 2007, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with the United States.1
Background
The U.S. economy has cooled more than expected over the past year, but employment remains
strong and growth abroad has picked up. Following an extended boom led by strong domestic
demand, the slowdown has largely reflected a drag from residential investment as the housing
market has weakened substantially. Unexpected weakness in business investment and net
exports, as well as an inventory correction, amplified the downturn in early 2007, but growth is
expected to recover in the remainder of the year. Private consumption has continued to grow
robustly as solid employment and wage growth have minimized spillovers from housing,
unemployment has remained extremely low, and, as a result, core inflation has only recently
started to ease. The global environment remains favorable, with robust growth in the euro area
and Asia.
The most likely scenario is a soft landing of the U.S. economy, with growth picking up during
2007 as the housing drag dissipates, business investment recovers, and net exports rebound
on strong foreign demand. Core inflation should ease as the output gap widens.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
At the same time, there are important risks to this outlook. Growth is uncomfortably close to the
“stall speed” associated with past recessions, even though unemployment and real interest
rates are more favorable. Subprime mortgage difficulties could extend the housing downturn,
which in turn could weaken consumption, and financial conditions could tighten. And with output
close to potential, unemployment low, commodities prices elevated, and productivity growth
falling, cost pressures could boost inflation.
Financial innovation and stability have been critical to U.S. economic success. Innovation has
been instrumental in attracting capital inflows and easy financing of the current account deficit,
and has also helped disperse risk, as core institutions have moved to an “originate-to-distribute”
model and derivative markets have grown. At the same time, new instruments have made it
more difficult to assess vulnerabilities and have thus created new regulatory challenges.
The current account deficit stabilized at 6 percent of GDP in 2006, with a stronger nonoil trade
balance partly offset by the impact of higher oil prices and lower net investment income. At
unchanged real exchange rates, the current account deficit is expected to narrow only slightly,
implying an accumulation of U.S. net foreign liabilities. Staff analysis suggests that further dollar
depreciation would be required over time to realign with fundamentals.
Short-run fiscal developments have been highly favorable, with the Administration’s goal of
halving the deficit by FY 2009 achieved three years ahead of time, largely on the strength of
surging revenues. The Administration and Congress have both endorsed a target of balancing
the budget by FY 2012, but agreement on how to achieve this objective, while providing
appropriately for war costs and for Alternative Minimum Tax relief, has yet to be reached.
Looking further ahead, the key challenge will be entitlement reform; without it, federal spending
on Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid is set to increase sharply over coming years,
threatening long-run fiscal sustainability.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors agreed with the thrust of the staff appraisal. Prospects for the U.S. economy
are favorable, as activity has cooled following an extended boom led by domestic demand.
Nonetheless spillovers from the housing market slowdown and the subprime mortgage market
problems cannot be overlooked. Thus, the most likely scenario is a soft landing, with growth
recovering and inflation easing, but risks remain. In particular, consumption could be weaker
and financial market conditions could tighten rapidly. Directors also cautioned that cost
pressures from rising oil and commodity prices and a tight labor market could raise inflation
risks.
Against these prospects, Directors considered current monetary policy to be consistent with a
soft landing. They commended the Federal Reserve for its emphasis on well-anchored inflation
expectations, and saw scope for flexibility in balancing inflation risks with concerns about
activity.

3
Financial innovation and stability have been key to U.S. economic success and the funding of
the current account deficit. The financial system has shown impressive resilience, including to
recent difficulties in the subprime mortgage market, but new regulatory challenges have been
created by rapid innovation. Directors agreed that regulators should focus prudential oversight
on core commercial and investment banks and welcomed the authorities’ plan to review options
for streamlining the financial regulatory system. They cautioned, however, that financial
innovation has complicated risk assessment at a time of higher risk taking and deteriorating
lending standards in some sectors. As financial conditions tighten, unanticipated risk
concentrations and links across markets could come to light. This underlines the importance of
ensuring that risk management systems are robust. Recent problems with subprime mortgages
also highlight the need for consistent consumer protection, without undue constraints on
innovation.
The new emphasis on improving the effectiveness of financial regulation is welcome. To ease
interagency coordination and shorten regulatory reaction times, Directors supported increased
use of general principles as a guide to rule making and recent initiatives to explore the scope for
rationalizing the regulatory structure.
Directors also welcomed initiatives to lower regulatory costs and increase financial market
competitiveness. These include guidance reducing the compliance burden of parts of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act on smaller firms, new rules making deregistering from U.S. exchanges
easier for foreign companies, and the consideration given to recognizing some foreign
regulatory regimes and international accounting standards.
Directors agreed that large valuation gains have stabilized U.S. net foreign liabilities as a ratio to
GDP in recent years, but the upward trend is likely to resume given large current account
deficits. They noted the staff’s assessment that the dollar appears to be overvalued relative to
its longer-term value in real effective terms and that a further real depreciation could contribute
to rebalancing demand and asset portfolios—although, with rapid financial innovation continuing
to attract net capital inflows, the adjustment would likely be gradual. A number of Directors,
however, found that the evidence for the overvaluation of the dollar was not convincing.
While a disorderly resolution of global imbalances is unlikely, the potential costs are high as a
disruption in U.S. financial markets would lower both domestic and—via financial market
spillovers—foreign demand. Directors thus emphasized the importance of sound and innovative
U.S. financial markets and implementation of policies to support U.S. saving agreed in the
Fund’s Multilateral Consultation.
Directors recognized the authorities’ commitment to free trade and urged them to adopt a more
ambitious agenda to achieve a positive outcome to the Doha Round.
Directors commended recent fiscal performance and the intention to balance the budget by FY
2012. They emphasized, however, that further effort would be needed to forge consensus on
how to achieve budgetary balance.

4
The key fiscal challenge remains reform of unsustainable entitlement programs. Directors
welcomed proposals to contain the budgetary costs of Medicare spending by strengthening the
link between premiums and income, while cautioning that sustainability would require more
fundamental reform of the high-cost health system. They also urged the authorities to develop a
consensus on Social Security reform.
A tighter medium-term target would offer greater room for maneuver in addressing long-term
fiscal pressures, while also contributing to current account adjustment. A number of Directors
supported a target of balancing the budget excluding the Social Security surplus. It was also
observed that revenue increases might be needed to achieve this goal, and a number of
Directors viewed that higher taxation of energy consumption should be considered. They also
emphasized the need to overhaul the complex tax system by reducing and better targeting
write-offs while further shielding saving from income taxes.
It is expected that the next Article IV consultation with the United States will be held on the
standard 12-month cycle.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.
