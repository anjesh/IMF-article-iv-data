BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA
Staff Report for the 2007 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2007 Consultation with
Bosnia and Herzegovina
Approved by Juha Kähkönen and Scott Brown
June 28, 2007
Executive Summary
Background and outlook: Strong growth and low inflation reflect the benign international
environment, the effects of past reforms in certain sectors, and the currency board. The introduction
of VAT yielded high—but partly temporary—revenues leading to a large fiscal surplus in 2006.
Strong export growth and subdued imports reduced the current account deficit to 11½ percent of GDP
in 2006 (possibly 5-7 percent of GDP after correcting for underreporting of current receipts).
Although balance of payments data weaknesses hamper an accurate assessment, the real exchange
rate does not appear to be misaligned and recent export trends are reassuring. Bosnia &
Herzegovina’s complex constitutional arrangements and ethnic divisions weaken incentives to
cooperate and policies drifted last year. Unless this drift is reversed, the lapsing of one-off VAT
revenue and last year’s pre-election spending hikes would generate a fiscal deficit in 2007; and over
the medium term, growth could lose steam and net foreign liabilities could rise further.
Authorities’ policies: All three governments indicated that they share the goals of maintaining a
prudent fiscal position and preserving competitiveness through structural reforms, creating a single
economic space, and ensuring financial stability. But these goals are not always translated into
coherent policy plans: there is no medium-term framework for the government as a whole, fiscal
policy coordination is weak, and the reform momentum is slow.
Staff recommendations: Minimize the swing in the fiscal position in 2007 and aim at a general
government balance over the medium term. Use large privatization receipts expected in 2007-08 to
finance pension reform and not for current spending. Private sector involvement in infrastructure
would be appropriate but only if a strong institutional framework is in place. Improve fiscal policy
coordination through a strong Fiscal Council law, though ultimately the political will to cooperate is
paramount. Harmonize direct taxes, liberalize the labor market, and ensure the portability of social
benefits to create a single economic space. Improve credit risk management further, unify bank
supervision, and close gaps in nonbank oversight.
Bosnia & Herzegovina has not accepted the obligations under Art. VIII, Sections 2, 3 and 4 but
maintains restrictions on the transferability of balances and interest accrued on frozen foreign
currency deposits. Staff does not recommend approval of these restrictions.

I. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
1.
Bosnia & Herzegovina labors under a complex and fragmented political system.
The Dayton Peace Agreement that ended the war in 1995 created two largely autonomous
Entities (the Republika Srpska (RS) and the Croat-Bosniak Federation of Bosnia &
Herzegovina (Federation), itself divided into ten largely ethnic cantons), which exercise most
economic power; and a State government with a very limited mandate. This structure has
entrenched ethnic divisions, as highlighted by last October’s elections; causes fragmentation
and duplication of many domestic policy functions; and weakens incentives to cooperate.
The Office of the UN High Representative (HR), with extensive powers to impose or
overrule legislation and dismiss elected officials, has so far held the system together and
gradually expanded the mandate of the State. Recognizing the need for greater local
ownership, the HR has recently curbed the use of these powers, and his office is to be closed
in 2008. But a modest first attempt at constitutional reform failed in 2006; key measures, like
police reform—a condition for signing the Stabilization & Association Agreement with the
EU—are stalled; and policy coordination between Entities and State is weak.
2.
The economy is nevertheless enjoying its fourth consecutive year of stable
growth underpinned by the currency board. Export growth of 29 percent on the back of
productivity gains, export price increases, and improvements in reporting following the
introduction of the VAT, combined with robust domestic demand, pushed real GDP up
6 percent last year (Figure 1). The export expansion slowed this year (the improvement in
reporting was one-off) but was still 24 percent in the first four months compared to the same
period last year. The currency board anchored prices: headline inflation, reflecting the VAT
effect and administered price hikes, averaged 7 percent last year but declined to 1½ percent
in early 2007. The recorded current account deficit was almost halved last year to
11.5 percent of GDP reflecting the improvement in the trade gap; the “true” deficit was
probably 5-7 percent of GDP as official statistics underestimate current inflows. Unit labor
cost trends and other standard indicators suggest that competitiveness is favorable, while the
recent gains in export market shares were broadly based and focused in key markets, as well
as in sectors of growing global importance (Figure 2). Bank borrowing and other unidentified
inflows pushed official reserves to €2.9 billion (5¼ months of imports) at end-April 2007.
3.
The pace of financial deepening, a key contributor to growth, is consistent with
regional trends, although supervision has weaknesses. After an initial surge, steady
private sector credit growth of about 25 percent annually has contributed to a gradual
increase in the credit-to-GDP ratio. The pace of financial deepening is in line with trends in
Central and Southeastern Europe (Figure 3). On the supply side, credit expansion is
stimulated by competition and consolidation in the banking sector, which is dominated by
foreign banks, and financed largely by lending from these banks to their local affiliates
(Figure 4; for an in-depth analysis, see accompanying Selected Issues paper, Chapter VI).

Although bank soundness indicators are good and improving, last year’s FSAP identified a
number of weaknesses in supervision, notably its fragmentation into two Entity-based
agencies. While this has not been addressed, the inclusion of individuals in the credit registry
in 2007—also an FSAP recommendation—was a key step toward better risk management.1
4.
Fiscal policy has thus far been prudent and public debt low, though the size of
the government is large. Since 2004, the general government has been close to balance or in
surplus. The VAT introduced on January 1, 2006 generated a surge of revenue, partly due to
one-off factors (estimated at 1½ percent of GDP), while the share of expenditures was kept at
its 2005 level. The general government thus recorded a surplus of 3 percent of GDP. At about
50 percent of GDP, the size of the government is large, reflecting inefficiencies and
duplication of functions. At the same time, at 23 percent of GDP at end-2006, public debt is
low. Even after the planned bond issuance to cover outstanding domestic claims against the
government—which staff assumes will raise the debt-to-GDP ratio by some 25 percentage
points over the next three years the debt will still be low in net present value terms, as most
of it is concessional. The introduction of statutory borrowing limits for all levels of
government was a major step toward fiscal discipline: though not yet binding, these ceilings
could be helpful in limiting fiscal deficits in the future (Box 1).
Box 1. Government Debt Laws
Law on government borrowing, debt, and guarantees were adopted by the State in 2005 and the RS in
2007, and a similar draft law is pending approval in the Federation.
Borrowing limits. The state and RS laws limit borrowing by imposing ceilings on projected debt service
(including amortization) at 18 percentage of previous year’s revenue. In the RS, the limit also applies to
municipalities, whose foreign borrowing requires a separate approval from the Finance ministry if
projected debt service exceeds 10 percent of municipal revenue. The State limit will be subject to annual
reviews after the first three years. The Federation draft law imposes the same debt service ceiling.
Within this envelope, the cap for cantons is 5 percentage, and that for municipalities gradually rises from
3 to 10 percent.
Institutional framework. The State Finance ministry prepares a five-year State Debt Management
Strategy in cooperation with a Debt Committee (an advisory body composed of representatives of the
State and Entities, including Finance Ministers). A separate Debt committee in the Federation, composed
of the Federal and cantonal Finance Ministers, coordinates borrowing and debt management in the
Entity.

5.
This good overall picture reflects a benign external environment and the effects
of past economic reforms. Growth in Bosnia & Herzegovina’s trading partners was strong.

interest rates facilitated the financing of the current account deficit. Although Bosnia &
Herzegovina generally lags behind the region in terms of structural reforms (Figures 5
and 6), certain reforms in specific sectors have had a sizeable impact: industrial production
and exports of key products, such as steel and aluminium, benefited from foreign investment;
the successful introduction and administration of the VAT led to the good fiscal outcome in
2006; last but not least, the process of financial deepening was spurred by the privatization
and opening of domestic banks to foreign participation.
6.
The outlook for the rest of 2007 is fair, but the effects of long-standing
weaknesses will start becoming evident. The momentum of growth is projected to continue,
the international economic environment to remain favorable, and inflation to remain
contained. In contrast to these positive trends:
•

The governments’ failure to resist spending pressures in the runup to last October’s
elections will, in the absence of corrective action, cause a sharp deterioration of the
government balance. The one-off effects of the VAT will disappear while the bill for
pre-election spending increases—most notably in the Federation—will come due this
year. As a result, the general government could register a deficit of up to 1½ percent
of GDP in 2007.

•

This fiscal impulse, combined with higher private demand, will boost imports, as data
for the first four months already show. As a result, the current account deficit is likely
to widen somewhat in 2007. Large privatization receipts, however, will provide
sufficient non debt-creating financing.

7.
The medium-term baseline outlook is relatively stable but, under current
policies, the risks would gradually increase. These risks are explored further in
Chapters II-IV of the accompanying Selected Issues paper.
•

Net exports will continue to provide stimulus reflecting strong partner demand and
recent trends in market penetration, but growing export volumes would be partly
offset by falling world metal prices (WEO) in the outer years. On the assumption of
continued structural policy drift, the staff’s baseline scenario (Table 9) assumes that
growth would slowly lose steam, the private savings-investment gap would narrow
only marginally, and the current account deficit would stay high. Although net
foreign liabilities now are low, persistent current account deficits would eventually
bring them to very high levels.

•

Economic growth would not make a
significant dent in unemployment
unless the Entity governments—under
whose purview these policies fall—
implement corporate restructuring and
tax and labor market reforms.
Moreover, because labor mobility is
limited, unemployment in depressed
areas would stay high and the creation
of a single labor market—and thus a
single economic space—prove elusive.

Government revenues are projected to decline slowly, reflecting the loss of trade
taxes as EU integration advances while, absent new measures, expenditures would
remain high, leading to a gradual deterioration in the general government balance.
Toward the end of the decade, when the statutory borrowing limits become binding,
the adjustments required to comply would be significant. Absent a comprehensive
medium-term fiscal strategy and effective policy coordination, however, it is not clear
how these adjustments would be made.

•

Financial sector indicators were reassuring and some steps have been made in
response to the FSAP recommendations last year. However, remaining vulnerabilities
in the system could, if left unaddressed, amplify the impact of other shocks.
II. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS

8.
There was consensus on the broad strategic economic objectives... The programs
of the new governments emphasized private sector development; strengthening
competitiveness to reduce the current account deficit and safeguard the currency board;
creating jobs in the formal economy to make a dent in high unemployment; building a single
economic space through tax harmonization; and preparing for EU membership.
9.
...but the authorities took a different view of the medium-term outlook than
staff. They considered that the recent improvement in the external position alleviated the
concerns about external sustainability expressed by staff in last year’s consultation and
validated their more optimistic assessment. They stressed that the unchanged-policies
assumption of the staff’s baseline was unduly pessimistic: the new governments would
accelerate the pace of reform, leading to more broad-based and sustainable growth. And they
expected export performance to continue strengthening.
10.
Staff acknowledged that there was significant upside potential to its baseline
outlook if reforms accelerated, but pointed out that Bosnia & Herzegovina’s reform

13
record was poor. Staff agreed that recent export trends were reassuring: if they persisted, the
current account would continue to improve and net foreign liabilities could stabilize within a
decade (see accompanying Selected Issues paper, Chapter II). But staff cautioned that first,
these trends were recent; second, that this assessment was subject to larger-than-usual
uncertainties due to data deficiencies; and, third, that it was conditional on prudent fiscal
policies and an acceleration of structural reforms going forward. In this connection, the
authorities’ record in implementing the Fund’s past policy advice was poor (Box 2),
reflecting weak ownership, fragmented institutions, low administrative capacity and—last
year—preoccupation with the elections. Staff noted that, with the exception of the latter,
these factors were still present.

Box 2. Implementation of Fund Policy Recommendations
Since the last Fund arrangement expired, there have been three Article IV consultations (in 2004, 2005,
and 2006) with broadly similar recommendations.
Fiscal policy. The general government generated surpluses in 2005 and 2006. However, the projected
policy easing in 2007 would be inappropriate. Untargeted social transfers increased further in 2006 and
there has been little progress in rationalizing government spending and reducing the tax burden on
labor.
Fiscal coordination. The draft law on the Fiscal Council is yet to be adopted.
Financial sector. The authorities have responded positively to the 2006 FSAP. A financial sector
surveillance unit has been established within the Central Bank of Bosnia & Herzegovina (CBBH), but
the decision on unifying banking supervision remains hostage to domestic politics.
Structural reform. Progress in macro-critical reforms—corporate restructuring, private sector
development, improving the business climate, labor market liberalization—has been patchy and
unequal: progress has been made in the RS but very little in the Federation.

11.
Against this background, discussions focused on (i) policies to ensure
macroeconomic and financial stability; and (ii) steps to improve coordination and
create a single economic space. Staff argued that the combination of a benign external
economic environment, strong growth momentum, and a fresh mandate from the electorate to
the new governments provided a good opportunity to address these challenges. The
authorities agreed, and stressed their intention to focus their energies on the economy. They
also agreed that past Fund advice on corporate restructuring and private sector development
was still relevant, although these topics were not a major focus of this year’s consultation
discussions. There is a high probability, however, that fundamental constitutional and
political issues will continue to dominate the debate in the near term.

14
12.
Staff stressed the need to improve the quality of statistics, which was not
adequate for effective surveillance. Improvements in national accounts and price statistics,
under preparation with Fund assistance, needed to be implemented as soon as possible.2
Major problems remained in the timeliness and coverage of general government statistics and
in the quality of balance of payments estimates, particularly for remittances, due mainly to
lack of capacity. The recent data ROSC (see accompanying paper) provides a blueprint for
needed technical and institutional improvements.
A. Fiscal Policy
13.
The authorities acknowledged the risk of a general government deficit emerging
in 2007 but saw little scope for adjusting policies.
General Government: Overall Balance
(in percent of GDP)

•

The RS budget was based on conservative
assumptions and targeted a broad balance
(including municipalities and extrabudgetary
funds but excluding foreign-financed projects)
and its implementation was on track. The RS
government, however, did not rule out a
supplementary budget later in the year.

•

The public finances in the Federation, both at Entity and cantonal levels, would come
under pressure this year as a result of unfunded pre-electoral hikes in demobilized
soldiers’ benefits. The Entity government did not intend to roll back these hikes, but
was confident that its present budget had sufficient margin to cover the additional
spending. Instead, it intended to focus on consolidating the legal framework and
administration of the multitude of veteran benefits. As regards cantons, since the
additional spending would be financed by a drawdown of deposits from accumulated
surpluses from 2006, it was not subject to any top-down constraint. The consolidated
Federation budget (including all levels of government and extrabudgetary funds but
excluding foreign-financed projects) would thus likely record a sizeable deficit.

•

The State budget was fully funded and broadly balanced. The State government saw
no need for action on its part to offset deficits in other parts of the general
government

2

Following the discussions, the State Statistical Agency presented the first expenditure-side estimates of GDP
for 2004 and 2005. These figures, not yet incorporated in the staff tables, show an upward revision of GDP by
about 15 percent as a result of improved estimates of the gray economy. Combined with last year’s upward
revision, this comes close to staff’s earlier estimates of unrecorded activity.

15
14.
Staff expressed concern about the prospect of a large deterioration in the general
government position in 2007. A swing estimated at 4½ percentage points of GDP in the
general government balance would reverse the prudent fiscal management of recent years
and have repercussions for aggregate demand. To limit this swing, staff urged the RS to stick
to the spending levels in its original budget and save any higher-than-projected revenue, and
the Federation government to take measures to offset the likely deficits in cantonal budgets.
Staff supported the Federation government’s plan to consolidate the various laws dealing
with demobilized soldiers’ benefits but cautioned that this would be insufficient to generate
the required savings.
15.
The governments’ ambitious infrastructure investment plans, coupled with the
availability of substantial privatization receipts, raised questions about the authorities’
medium-term fiscal policy intentions. Staff noted that both Entity governments’ programs
envisaged large road-building projects (in the Federation alone, these amounted to 17 percent
of 2006 GDP over the coming four years). At the same time, the proceeds from large
privatizations would provide a ready source of cash: the RS government would receive
7½ percent of GDP this year from the sale of RS Telekom and oil refineries, and the
Federation could expect 2-4 percent of GDP over the next two years if it launched
privatization in earnest. How would these investment projects be managed and financed?
How would the privatization receipts be used? And how did both fit into the governments’
medium-term fiscal plans?
16.
The authorities did not have a comprehensive medium-term strategy for the
entire general government sector. All governments underscored their commitment to a
responsible fiscal policy, aware that this was the only macroeconomic management tool in a
currency board. This meant aiming their individual budgets at a balance or small surplus over
the medium term while gradually lowering their expenditure-to-GDP ratios. But these targets
did not cover all parts of the government, such as projects financed by foreign sources or
privatization receipts. And no authority was in a position to articulate clear medium-term
fiscal policy objectives for Bosnia & Herzegovina as a whole.
•

Both Entity governments stressed that they did not intend to use privatization receipts
to finance current spending. The RS government had a well-developed—but not yet
fully-approved—plan that envisaged setting aside about 15 percent of these receipts
to fund pension reform (on which it had started preparatory work with World Bank
assistance) and using the rest to (i) finance public investment projects and (ii) support
strategic sectors through the banking system. It emphasized that the allocation
decisions for the latter would be done by commercial banks on business grounds. The
Federation also envisaged using future privatization receipts for investment and
support of key sectors but did not have concrete plans at the time of the discussions.

16
•

As regards the financing of infrastructure investment, notably road construction, the
2007 Entity budgets already included several small projects. For larger projects,
Entity governments envisaged using a combination of concessions and public-private
partnerships. A number of feasibility studies were completed or underway, but no
comprehensive plan existed so far for the country as a whole. Staff expressed
reservations about the current institutional capacity to handle public-private
partnerships, especially for large projects, but the authorities were confident that they
could manage these arrangements.

17.
The authorities were aware of the risks arising from some unsettled categories of
claims against the government. Significant progress had been made (reported in last year’s
consultation) in determining fiscally responsible settlement terms for frozen foreign currency
deposits (FFCDs), war damage, and other claims. However, proposed amendments to the law
on FFCDs and pending lawsuits could undermine these arrangements, while the size and
settlement terms for restitution claims were still undecided. The State government agreed that
the potential cost of the FFCD amendments could be significant. While not ruling out minor
revisions in the settlement terms, it intended to stick as close as possible to the original law.
It also planned to finalize a restitution law that would cap financial compensation and set
terms consistent with fiscal sustainability.
18.
Staff advocated aiming at a general government balance over the medium term.
The currency board arrangement, uncertainties regarding the size and settlement terms of
some government liabilities, and the declining concessionality of government debt justified a
conservative target. A balanced budget would reduce the public debt-to-GDP ratio (including
debt assumptions to cover domestic claims) to about 40 percent of GDP by 2012 and provide
sufficient cushion for plausible shocks (Appendix I). It would also be a simple anchor for
policymakers and the public. Achieving an overall balance while reducing the tax burden and
making room for priority investments will require cuts in current spending, where there is
ample scope for savings identified in the recent World Bank Public Expenditure Review.
B. Improving Policy Coordination and Creating a Single Economic Space
19.
The discussion of fiscal policy highlighted the insidious effect of lack of policy
coordination. The fragmentation of fiscal authority and complexity of inter-governmental
fiscal relations is a by-product of Bosnia & Herzegovina’s constitutional setup and could thus
best be addressed in the context of fundamental constitutional reform. But the problem is
aggravated by lack of cooperation between the various governments in setting and pursuing
their fiscal policy objectives.
20.
The authorities were taking steps to improve fiscal policy coordination. They
intended to strengthen the legal basis for the Fiscal Council that would set targets and
coordinate fiscal policy for the country as a whole. The Council, including the Prime

17
Ministers and Finance Ministers of the Entities and the State, was already operating in a
rudimentary fashion. The authorities had prepared a draft law that would provide a firm legal
basis, formalize procedures, and define the scope of coordination of budgetary policy.
Moreover, they argued that the statutory borrowing limits were an important additional
coordinating and disciplining device.
21.
Staff welcomed these steps despite some reservations, but argued that they
would not be sufficient to ensure effective coordination. The draft Fiscal Council law
provided appropriate voting and deadlock-breaking rules, but the definition of the
consolidated budget balance excluded most capital spending and the penalties envisaged for
noncompliance were weak. Staff urged the Federation to approve as soon as possible the law
on borrowing limits, and all governments to improve public financial management so that the
limits could be effective. It cautioned, however, that fiscal rules and institutions alone were
not sufficient to guarantee effective coordination and sound policies: political will to
cooperate was paramount. Absent that, the borrowing limits, even if effective, may force
piecemeal and suboptimal expenditure adjustments on various levels of government and
might not prove politically sustainable.
22.
The creation of a single economic space in Bosnia & Herzegovina was still
unfinished business. Staff noted that the last few years had seen significant economic
convergence between the two Entities, as the economy of the RS caught up with the
Federation, but few signs of economic integration between them and even among cantons in
the Federation (see accompanying Selected Issues paper, Chapter V). Labor and business
mobility was impeded by a myriad of regulatory and tax barriers. The authorities outlined
plans to reform corporate and personal income taxes, simplify the process for obtaining
business permits, reduce regulations, and simplify inspections. In these areas, the RS had
already made significant progress, and action was now needed by the Federation. Staff
welcomed this but noted that creating a single economic space would require farther-reaching
reforms, notably (i) harmonizing the laws on securities and companies; (ii) amending labor
legislation to stop the accumulation of wage claims in cases where workers were not
effectively employed by the company, thus allowing workers to switch employers without
first having to settle existing claims; (iii) harmonizing the base for employers’ contributions
on wages; and (iv) ensuring the portability of pension and health benefits across cantonal and
Entity borders. The authorities were non-committal. The RS government, in particular, was
concerned that emphasizing harmonization with the Federation might imply slowing down
the pace of their own reforms.
C. Ensuring Financial Stability
23.
Authorities and staff agreed that the pace of financial deepening per se was not a
concern, but financial stability required close attention. The CBBH stressed that the
recent extension of the credit registry to individuals in 2007 would help improve banks’ risk

18
management. In addition, given its mandate in the area of financial stability, the CBBH with
assistance from the Eurosystem central banks and the Fund was upgrading its monitoring and
analysis of the financial sector and had started preparing regular Financial Stability Reports.
24.
Staff welcomed these steps but felt that more could be done to safeguard system
soundness and weaken the link between credit expansion and foreign borrowing. In
particular, it noted that under competitive pressures, some banks may be assuming higher
credit risk; that some large banks were repeatedly fined for violations of prudential rules,
which suggested that fines were low; and that current regulations created a bias in favor of
bank borrowing from abroad to finance credit. To address these concerns, the two Entity
supervisory agencies should:
•

Tighten loan classification by moving loans with payments overdue more than
30 days to category C gradually over the next 12-18 months.

•

Raise the fines for noncompliance with prudential regulations.

•

Relax the maturity matching requirement between banks’ assets and liabilities in
order to reduce the need for foreign borrowing to finance credit. This should be done
gradually and with appropriate prudential safeguards to ensure adequate bank
liquidity.

25.
Staff reiterated the recommendation to unify bank supervision either at the
CBBH or in a new, independent agency. A single supervisor was necessary for financial
sector stability, as well as for establishing cooperation with key foreign supervisors, some of
whom were hesitating to conclude Memoranda of Understanding with the Entity agencies.
Staff also recommended strengthening the legal and supervisory framework for insurance
and leasing. While accepting the economic rationale of these recommendations, the
governments—particularly in the RS—noted that they would imply a transfer of
competencies from Entities to a State-level agency. They could therefore not be decided
separately from the broader constitutional debate. Against this background, staff advised the
authorities at least to improve cooperation between the domestic supervisors and the CBBH.
III. STAFF APPRAISAL
26.
Bosnia & Herzegovina is in its fourth year of strong and stable growth. This
largely reflects the benign international environment and the effects of past reforms in key
sectors and the financial system, as well as the benefits of the currency board.
27.
The authorities should take advantage of this opportunity to address longstanding distortions. Many of these distortions, such as the large and inefficient public
sector, segmented labor market, and overregulated business environment, are to some extent

19
a reflection of the more fundamental constitutional problems and ethnic divisions facing the
country. But even within this fragmented governance framework, much can be done to
improve macroeconomic management, strengthen financial stability, and facilitate private
sector development. Achieving this requires a deeper sense of ownership of and commitment
to economic reforms, and stronger political will to cooperate, than currently apparent.
28.
Urgent action is needed to limit the deterioration in the fiscal position this year
and set the basis for prudent fiscal policies in the medium term. To minimize the
incipient fiscal relaxation in 2007, the RS government should stick to the expenditure plans
in its original budget and the Federation government should act to offset the deficits likely to
arise in cantons. To ensure fiscal sustainability, borrowing limits alone will not be sufficient:
a comprehensive medium-term fiscal framework for the general government is needed. This
framework should aim at maintaining a general government balance, in light of the
exigencies of the currency board and uncertainties regarding the size of government
liabilities. Fiscal sustainability also requires rejecting proposed amendments to the FFCD law
and ensuring that financial restitution is capped at a fiscally responsible level. Private sector
involvement in infrastructure is appropriate but poses risks: public-private partnerships can
result in significant future public liabilities and should not be used unless a strong
institutional framework is in place.
29.
Privatization receipts are both an opportunity and a challenge. In the absence of
nonconcessional public debt that could be repaid, genuine one-off expenses that boost growth
would not jeopardize debt dynamics if financed by privatization, even if they temporarily
raise the recorded deficit. Plans to use part of privatization receipts for pension reform are
appropriate. But using them to finance private business development in “strategic sectors” is
not a good option: if the business environment is improved, the private sector should be able
to accomplish this without government support; if not, government support will make little
difference and the money may be wasted. In addition, sizeable privatization revenue may
complicate liquidity management in the financial system and jeopardize macroeconomic
stability. To avoid this, the Entity governments should deposit these receipts abroad or with
the CBBH until it is time to spend them, and spread out their use over time.
30.
Improvements in fiscal policy coordination are urgently needed. The statutory
borrowing limits are a good first step. The authorities’ intention to establish a firm legal basis
for the Fiscal Council is welcome, but the current draft law should expand the definition of
the general government to cover all public investment and strengthen penalties for
noncompliance. Ultimately, however, these institutional improvements will not be sufficient
to ensure effective coordination and good fiscal outcomes without the political will to
cooperate.
31.
Although the real exchange rate does not appear misaligned, structural reforms
are important for safeguarding competitiveness, as well as for creating a single

20
economic space. Recent balance of payments trends assuage earlier concerns about the
viability of the currency board and, notwithstanding serious data weaknesses that complicate
an accurate assessment, the level of the exchange rate appears appropriate. But going
forward, reforms to restructure the corporate sector, improve the business environment, make
the country more attractive for foreign investment, and deregulate the labor market are key
for sustaining competitiveness. Harmonizing corporate income taxes, employers’
contributions, and capital market legislation, ensuring the portability of pension and health
benefits, and facilitating labor mobility are also critical for internal economic integration.
32.
Maintaining financial stability requires improving credit risk management
further, closing gaps in nonbank oversight, and unifying bank supervision. Staff
welcomes the extension of the credit registry to individuals and the initiatives of the CBBH
in monitoring financial stability and coordinating supervision. Tightening loan loss
classification, raising penalties for noncompliance, and relaxing maturity matching
requirements would boost system soundness and weaken the link between credit expansion
and foreign borrowing. While necessary, these steps would not be sufficient to ensure an
appropriate framework: strengthening the regulatory framework for insurance and leasing
and ultimately unifying bank supervision are also necessary.
33.
Statistics are not adequate for effective surveillance. Recent improvements
notwithstanding, major problems remain in the timeliness and coverage of general
government statistics and in the quality of balance of payments estimates. The authorities
should persevere with the improvements currently underway and follow up on the
recommendations of the recent data ROSC.
34.
Bosnia & Herzegovina has not accepted the obligations under Article VIII,
Sections 2, 3 and 4 but maintains restrictions on the transferability of balances and interest
accrued on frozen foreign currency deposits. Staff does not recommend approval of these
restrictions.
35.
It is proposed that the next consultation with Bosnia & Herzegovina take place on the
standard 12-month cycle.

1/ Data for March 2005 onward are based on the upgraded classification of general government, so there is a structural break in March 2005.
2/ The jump in broad money growth in 2004 reflects banks' efforts to mobilize foreign currency deposits, following a tightening of end-month
forex exposure limits. Further regulatory changes in late 2004 dampened these efforts.

ATTACHMENT I
BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
The debt sustainability analysis is based on the staff baseline (unchanged policies)
scenario (Table 9 of the staff report). The medium-term outlook is stable, with growth
momentum, even in the absence of reforms; low inflation; further gains in export market
share which, in the outer years, are partly offset by declining metals prices (WEO); a broadly
unchanged current account deficit; and a gradual deterioration in the fiscal position, which
nonetheless keeps the overall balance within a sustainable range for the projection period.
After an initial jump due to settlement of domestic claims, the public debt-to-GDP ratio
declines over the projection period, although bound tests show risks. Issuance of bonds
to cover domestic claims in 2007–08 is conservatively assumed to total slightly over
30 percentage points of GDP—see details in Box 1. Aside from this, gross financing needs
are on the rise, although they appear manageable. A growth slowdown or a further fiscal
deterioration, however, could put the debt on an unsustainable path: a one-half standard
deviation negative shock to growth or the primary balance would lead to potentially
explosive debt dynamics. With the balanced-budget policy recommended by staff, however
(Scenario A3), the debt-to-GDP ratio would decline rapidly and the downward trend is not
affected by shocks.
Box 1. Key Assumptions for the Fiscal Sustainability Analysis
•

Continued strong growth and low inflation, and unchanged policies in line with the staff’s
baseline medium-term projections (Table 9). General government deficit gradually widens to
2.9 percent of GDP by 2012 before the statutory borrowing ceilings force an adjustment,
bringing the budget into balance by 2017.

•

Lower access to concessional external borrowing (with an average grant element of 35 percent),
with disbursements averaging ¾ percent of GDP over 2007–12 period, compared to 1 ½ percent
of GDP in 2005 and even higher access before.

•

Domestic borrowing on commercial terms (average projected LIBOR at 5 percent + 200 basis
points) to cover additional financing needs.

•

Increase in the face value of debt by 18 percent of GDP in 2007 associated with the settlement
of frozen foreign currency deposits (FFCD), war claims, and general government obligations.
The average grant element of these settlements is expected to exceed 25 percent.

•

Increase in the face value of debt equivalent to 10 percent of GDP in 2008, and to 5 percent of
GDP in 2009 from the possible recognition of additional domestic claims (losses of state
enterprises, restitution claims, and other) on terms similar to those for the FFCDs.

•

Privatization receipts of 7½ percent of GDP in 2007 in the RS (from the sale of the RS Telecom
and refining operations) and of 1½ percent in the FBIH (from the sale of Aluminij Mostar and
Energoinvest).

31
Bosnia & Herzegovina’s external debt is relatively high at 50 percent of GDP, but
external sustainability indicators (external debt-to-export and GDP ratio) improve over
the medium term, even in the absence of policy change. This reflects the assumption that
economic growth will remain well above the real effective interest rate on external debt, as
the latter reflects a large share of concessional debt—notably to the World Bank (Box 2).
Gross external financing needs as a percentage of GDP remain constant after peaking in 2007
due to a jump in the demand for imports. Bound tests show limited risks except for shocks to
the current account. A change in the borrowing structure (from public to private or from
concessional to nonconcessional) could also weaken the dynamics of Bosnia and
Herzegovina’s external debt, although this risk appears manageable. Finally, an additional
risk is that of a liquidity, rather than solvency, crisis. Although the dynamics in the baseline
appear reassuring, current account financing will continue to depend heavily on largely
unidentified and potentially volatile inflows. Reversal of these inflows could constrain
liquidity and either compress imports or force short-term borrowing at much less favorable
terms.

Box 2. Key Assumptions for the External Debt Sustainability Analysis
•

Continued strong growth and low inflation, and unchanged policies in line with the staff’s
baseline medium-term projections (Table 9).

•

Decelerating growth rate of exports and imports (in value), with the export growth rate higher
than that of imports.

•

Limited access to concessional external borrowing, with new borrowing at market rate. World
Bank disbursements declining sharply during the projection period.

•

Sustained but gradually declining, inflows of remittances, cross-border and seasonal workers’
income.

I. Baseline Projections

2008

1/ General government gross debt; the jump in 2007–09 reflects recognition and settlement of domestic claims.
2/ Derived as [(r - p(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; p = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; a = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as ae(1+r).
5/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
6/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.

VII. Safeguards Assessment
Under the Fund's safeguards assessment policy, Central Bank of Bosnia and
Herzegovina (CBBH) was subject to an assessment in the context of a potential
successor for the 2002 arrangement. The assessment was completed on January 24,
2005 and recommendations were made to address weaknesses identified in the
Bank's safeguards. Based on the information received from the authorities all the
recommendations have been implemented.
VIII. Exchange Rate Arrangements
The currency of Bosnia and Herzegovina is the convertible marka (KM),
introduced on August 11, 1997. On September 5, 2002, the State parliament
approved an amendment to the CBBH law that changes the peg of the KM from the
DM to the Euro under a currency board arrangement. The KM is pegged to the euro
at KM 1 = 0.5113 euro.
Bosnia and Herzegovina maintains restrictions on payments and transfers for
current international transactions resulting from measures taken with respect to
frozen foreign currency deposits as identified in IMF Country Report No. 02/52.
IX. FSAP
Two FSAP missions took place in December 2005 and March 2006, and an Aide
Mémoire was presented to the authorities. The FSAP assessed risks to financial
stability and weaknesses in banking supervision using a Basel Core Principles
assessment. It also considers financial sector development needs in the areas of
insurance, access to finance, the insolvency regime and corporate governance,
drawing on a detailed assessment of the OECD Principles of Good Corporate
Governance. The FSSA was presented to the Board along with the 2006 Article IV
consultation IMF Country Report No. 06/403.
X.

Last Article IV Consultation
Bosnia and Herzegovina is on the twelve month cycle, subject to the provisions of
the decision on consultation cycles approved on July 15, 2002. The last Article IV
consultation was concluded on October 13, 2006.

Annex II—Bosnia & Herzegovina: World Bank Relations
A. Bosnia and Herzegovina’s Poverty Reduction Strategy
1.
The World Bank has taken the lead in supporting the structural and institutional
reforms underpinning progress from post-conflict recovery, and the preparation of the
Medium-Term Development Strategy/Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). The PRSP,
drawing on the EC’s 2003 feasibility study of the stabilization and association process, was
agreed by entity and state governments in February 2004 for the period through 2007. The
Paper commits the authorities to sustainable and balanced economic development, poverty
reduction, and accelerated EU integration. The PRSP was updated in mid-2006 to reflect
progress until that date.
2.
Close to the completion of the PRSP, a number of the proposed measures have been
implemented. Policy hesitancy, however, has delayed the implementation of some of the
most important measures, including adoption of a law on higher education, a legal
framework to establish minimum social entitlements for all citizens, introduction of targeted
safety nets, and definition of reform of the pension system. Progress in reducing poverty and
advancing privatization has lagged. The authorities intend to follow the PRSP with strategies
for national development and social inclusion that will be the basis for the country’s first
National Development Plan (2008–13).
B. World Bank Projects
3.
A Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) covering FY05–07 was approved in August
2004. It is anchored in the PRSP and structured along three pillars: (i) improving public
finance and strengthening institutions; (ii) promoting sustainable private-sector led growth;
and (iii) investing in key social and economic infrastructure. The base case sets IDA
allocations at US$152 million and is conditional on satisfactory macroeconomic and reform
performance. The CAS is designed to help improve creditworthiness, which should
ultimately enable BiH to access a substantially larger pool of IBRD resources.
4.
While no longer receiving the levels of financing following the 1995 Dayton Accord,
BiH still enjoys exceptional access to concessional IDA financing despite income per capita
well-above the IDA threshold. The active IDA portfolio includes 15 active projects
(12 investment, one adjustment and one GEF grant) with a total commitment of
US$299 million, of which US$178 million remain to be disbursed. A US$290 million
“Power 4” electricity sector modernization project became effective in April 2007. The
Bank will provide US$36 million, with other multilateral and bilateral donors providing the
rest.
5.
The investment side of the portfolio has performed well, with only a few problem
projects. On the adjustment (development policy) side of the Bank portfolio, progress has
been held back by weak government ownership over structural reforms. As a consequence,
the Bank let lapse at the end of June 2006 the $51 million Second Social Sector Adjustment
Credit (SOSAC2) and at the end of August 2006 the undisbursed balance of $18.5 million

40
under the Privatization Technical Assistance Credit (PTAC). The Economic
Management Structural Adjustment Credit (EMSAC), with an undisbursed second
tranche of $24 million, lapsed at the end of 2006 due to insufficient progress in enacting laws
on higher education, internal audit and public wages. The Bank delivered the Public
Expenditure and Institutional Review (PEIR) to the authorities in June 2006.
7.
Improving the business environment with support from Bank’s Business
Environment Adjustment Credit (BAC) will be critical to strengthening growth and
employment and encouraging investment. Although delayed, supporting legislation has now
been passed in both entities and is in the final stage of implementation. Pending the (surveybased) verification of intended outcomes in business registration and inspection reforms, the
conditions for disbursement of the final US$ 24 million tranche are expected to be met in late
2007.

ANNEX III—BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA: STATISTICAL ISSUES
1. Data provision is inadequate for surveillance purposes, especially in the areas of national
accounts and balance of payments statistics. Also, source data for government finance
statistics need improvement. The Dayton peace treaty, which ended the civil war, implicitly
gave responsibility for statistical functions to the two Entities (The Federation of Bosnia &
Herzegovina and Republika Srpska (RS)). In August 1998, the State created its own
statistical institute, the Bosnia & Herzegovina Agency for Statistics (BHAS) with a view to
compiling country-wide statistics in accordance with internationally accepted methodologies,
consolidating data produced by the Entities’ Statistical Institutes, and acting as the primary
coordinating agency for contacts with international agencies. Significant technical assistance
has been provided in recent years, mainly by the European Union. A Fund resident statistical
advisor was assigned to the Central Bank of Bosnia & Herzegovina (CBBH) in May 1999, to
provide technical assistance in the development of all areas of macroeconomic statistics on
the basis of the comprehensive review conducted in early 1998 by the Fund’s Multisector
Statistics mission and the recommendations of Fund missions in the areas of monetary and
balance of payments statistics. A country page for Bosnia & Herzegovina in International
Finance Statistics (IFS) was introduced in July 2001. A STA resident real sector statistical
adviser was appointed to Bosnia & Herzegovina in November 2005. The data ROSC mission
undertaken in March 2007 assessed the quality of the macroeconomic statistics.
A. Real Sector
2. Efforts have been made in both Entities to improve real sector statistics, but results have
been mixed. The Federation and RS both have published nominal GDP estimates using the
production approach based on international standards recommended by the 1993 SNA,
since 1998 and 1999, respectively. The first experimental accounts of GDP estimates by
expenditure components were recently finalized and presented to main users in a meeting
held at the BHAS on May 18, 2007. These estimates are available for 2004 and 2005 at
current prices. Estimates for 2005 were also prepared at 2004 prices. After a thorough review
and some revisions of the data, these estimates are to be released to the public shortly. These
estimates are about 14 percent higher than the official GDP figures, which are based on the
production approach and published by the BHAS. The discrepancy will be significantly
reduced once the new estimates are revised with the estimates of informal and non observed
economy (to be released in July 2007). The estimation of GDP using expenditure
components will enter a regular production cycle and estimates for 2006 will be release later
this year. In the event, GDP estimates do not adequately capture activities in the informal and
unobserved economy, short-term business and consumer surveys are not available, and a
statistical register of enterprises does not exist.
3. Both statistical offices compile price indices using outdated methodologies, and
consistent time series are not available. Industrial production indices are prepared in each
Entity, but there is no index at the country level and consistent time series are not available.
Labor statistics are the weakest area for both Institutes, and data on employment,
unemployment, and wage rates are based on questionable methodologies. The weights used
to compute the retail price index (RPI) are significantly outdated and quality adjustments are
not routinely undertaken

42
B. Balance of Payments
4. Trade data are published by the BHAS and balance of payments statistics by the Central
Bank of Bosnia & Herzegovina (CBBH). The quality of the balance of payments data is
generally poor, particularly the coverage of foreign grants, workers’ remittances, income
received by residents from working for international organizations in Bosnia & Herzegovina
and the spending by their nonresident staff, trade credit by suppliers, informal trade, and
changes in foreign currency cash holdings. Significant progress has been made in improving
merchandise trade by introducing the ASYCUDA processing system, integrating customs
administration for the whole country, reorganizing the customs, and introducing a trade
classification system. BHAS now produces export and import data from customs records, but
needs to produce the data on a general trade basis and not on a special trade basis.
C. Government Finance
5. The CBBH compiles government finance statistics (GFS) in accordance with the
definitions and concepts of the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001. The 2007 data
ROSC mission found that the institutional coverage of the GFS is broadly consistent with
international guidelines, but not all stocks and flows are measured due to insufficient source
data. In addition, the GFS does not include transactions related to projects directly financed
by international donors. Because accrual accounting has not yet been fully introduced in all
government institutions, transactions are recorded on a mixed accrual/cash basis. Data on the
level of outstanding domestic debt are being developed. The periodicity and timelines of data
on government operations and quarterly consolidated central government operations meet or
exceed GDDS recommendations. External government debt is published quarterly. GFS data
are broadly consistent with the balance of payments, but not with the national accounts or
monetary and banking statistics.
6.
Since 2005, the CBBH has reported GFS to STA for publication in the Government
Finance Statistics Yearbook, covering central government operations starting with data
for 2003. Higher frequency fiscal data are not yet reported for publication in the IFS.
D. Monetary Accounts
7. The CBBH reports monetary accounts to the Fund on a countrywide and Entity basis. In
early 2003, it began reporting weighted average interest rates for bank deposits and loans.
The IFS includes interest rate data since January 2002. From 1996 to 2004, several Fund
missions assisted in establishing an integrated system for compiling countrywide monetary
statistics compatible with Fund standards. The April/May 2004 mission reviewed
institutional changes and accounting developments that had important implications for
monetary statistics and assisted in revising and updating the compilation procedures. The
mission recommended improvements in, the treatment of “passive accounts” on banks’
balance sheets, banks’ claims arising from “credit card debts,” “euro-linked” loans in
national currency, and government accounts. The CBBH has been working towards reporting
monetary data to the Fund using the Standardized Report Forms developed by STA.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2007 Article IV Consultation with
Bosnia and Herzegovina
On July 16, 2007, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Bosnia and Herzegovina.3
Background
Bosnia and Herzegovina labors under a complex political system, which causes
fragmentation and duplication of many domestic policy functions, and weakens incentives
for cooperation between the Entities and the State. A modest first-round attempt at
constitutional reform failed in 2006; key measures, like police reform—a condition for signing
the Stabilization and Association Agreement with the EU—are stalled; and policy
coordination is weak.
The economy is nevertheless enjoying its fourth consecutive year of stable growth
underpinned by the currency board. Export growth of 29 percent on the back of productivity
gains, export price increases, and improvements in reporting following the introduction of the
VAT, combined with robust domestic demand, pushed real GDP up 6 percent in 2006. The
currency board anchored prices: headline inflation, reflecting the VAT effect and
administered price hikes, averaged 7 percent last year but declined to 1½ percent in early
2007. The recorded current account deficit was almost halved last year to 11.5 percent of

3

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return
to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive
Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board,
summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's
authorities.

45
GDP reflecting the improvement in the trade gap. Bank borrowing and other unidentified
inflows pushed official reserves to €2.9 billion (5¼ months of imports) at end-April 2007.
The pace of financial deepening, a key contributor to growth, is consistent with regional
trends, although supervision has weaknesses. After an initial surge, steady private sector
credit growth of about 25 percent annually has financed activity and contributed to a gradual
increase in the credit-to-GDP ratio. On the supply side, credit expansion is stimulated by
competition and consolidation in the banking sector, which is dominated by foreign banks,
and financed largely by lending from these banks to their local affiliates. Although bank
soundness indicators are good and improving, a number of weaknesses remain in
supervision, notably its fragmentation into two Entity-based agencies. While this has not
been addressed, the inclusion of individuals in the credit registry in 2007, was a key step
toward better risk management.
Fiscal policy has thus far been prudent and public debt low, though the size of the
government is large. The VAT introduced on January 1, 2006 generated a surge of revenue,
partly due to one-off factors, while the share of expenditures was kept at its 2005 level. The
general government thus recorded a surplus of 3 percent of GDP in 2006. At about 50
percent of GDP, the size of the government is large, reflecting inefficiencies and duplication
of functions. At the same time, at 23 percent of GDP at end-2006, public debt is low. Even
after the planned bond issuance to cover outstanding domestic claims against the
government—projected to raise the debt-to-GDP ratio by some 25 percentage points over
the next three years—the debt will still be low in net present value terms, as most of it is
concessional. The introduction of statutory borrowing ceilings for all levels of government
was a major step toward fiscal discipline: though not yet binding, these ceilings could be
effective in limiting fiscal deficits in the future.
This good overall picture reflects a benign external environment and the effects of past
economic reforms. Growth in Bosnia and Herzegovina’s trading partners was strong. World
prices of metals—a key export—rose 55 percent in 2005–06. Low world interest rates
facilitated the financing of the current account deficit. Although Bosnia and Herzegovina
generally lags behind the region in terms of structural reforms, certain reforms in specific
sectors have had a sizeable impact: industrial production and exports of key products, such
as steel and aluminium, benefited from foreign investment; the successful introduction and
administration of the VAT led to the good fiscal outcome in 2006; last but not least, the
process of financial deepening was spurred by the privatization and opening of domestic
banks to foreign participation.

Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the continued strong growth with low inflation, and the recent
marked improvement in the external balance in Bosnia and Herzegovina, which they
attributed largely to the effects of past structural reforms in key sectors and the benign
international environment, as well as to the benefits of the currency board.

46
Directors considered that the good economic performance offers an opportunity to tackle
long-standing distortions that currently limit the economy’s long-term growth potential: the
large and inefficient public sector, segmented labor market, and overregulated business
environment. While recognizing the institutional complexity for policy making, Directors
underscored the need for far-reaching additional reforms. In particular, they encouraged the
authorities to improve policy coordination, take steps to put the fiscal position on a
sustainable path, strengthen financial stability, and accelerate structural reforms to sustain
competitiveness and facilitate private sector development.
Directors expressed concern about the prospects of fiscal deterioration in 2007. They
encouraged the authorities to adhere to the original budget spending plans in the Republika
Srpska (RS) and to generate savings in the Federation’s central government budget in order
to offset the deficits likely to arise in the cantons. From a longer-term perspective, Directors
welcomed the adoption of the statutory borrowing limits, but cautioned that they would not
be sufficient to ensure medium-term sustainability. They stressed that a comprehensive
medium-term policy framework is needed, targeting an overall general government balance,
in light of the requirements of the currency board and uncertainties regarding the size of
government liabilities. In this context, Directors stressed the importance of ensuring that
domestic claims against the government, including for financial restitution, are kept at fiscally
sustainable levels, and that private-public partnerships are used only once an appropriate
institutional framework has been put in place.
Directors welcomed the progress in privatization, noting that the large expected receipts
could help finance one-off priority expenses. They endorsed the RS plans to use
privatization receipts for pension reform, but several Directors cautioned against financing
private business development in strategic sectors.
Directors underscored the importance of improving fiscal policy coordination. They
welcomed the authorities’ intention to establish a firm legal basis for the Fiscal Council, and
recommended that the current draft expand the definition of the general government to
cover all public investment and strengthen penalties for noncompliance. Directors
emphasized that effective coordination and good fiscal outcomes will not be possible without
the political will to cooperate.
Directors noted that recent export trends are reassuring about Bosnia & Herzegovina’s
external competitiveness position. At the same time, the external balance is dependent on
performance of a few key sectors and vulnerable to commodity price shifts. To sustain these
export trends, diversify the export base, and safeguard external competitiveness and the
viability of the currency board, Directors encouraged the authorities to accelerate structural
reforms. In particular, they called for actions to restructure the corporate sector, improve the
business environment, make the country more attractive for foreign investment, and
deregulate the labor market. Advancing internal integration will require harmonizing
corporate income taxation and the system of social contributions, and ensuring portability of
pension and health benefits and facilitating labor mobility.

47
Directors noted that financial sector indicators have remained largely positive. They
considered that maintaining financial stability in the presence of rapid credit growth requires
further improving credit risk management, closing gaps in nonbank oversight, and unifying
bank supervision. Directors favored tightening loan loss classification, raising penalties for
noncompliance, and relaxing maturity matching requirements as a way to boost system
soundness and weaken the link between credit expansion and foreign borrowing.
Directors welcomed the recent progress in improving national accounts statistics achieved
with the help of Fund technical assistance, but noted that major problems remain in the
timeliness and coverage of general government statistics and quality of balance-ofpayments estimates. Directors encouraged the authorities to step up their efforts to improve
data quality, including by leveraging technical assistance from donors and following up on
their recommendations.

Statement by Agge Bakker, Executive Director for Bosnia and Herzegovina
and Nir Klein, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
July 16, 2007
The authorities of Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) thank the staff for the constructive
and candid discussions in Sarajevo and Banja Luka. They share staff’s appraisal on the
challenges ahead and broadly agree with the report’s key recommendations. As in previous
years, the authorities give consent to the publication of the report.
Macroeconomic developments and outlook
Largely benefiting from favorable external conditions and past structural reforms, the
BiH economy remained, in 2006, on a high growth path. Robust export performance,
reflecting strong demand from trading partners, increased industrial production and high
metal prices, contributed to a sharp decline in the current account deficit, and together with
further accumulation of international reserves, mitigated external stability concerns. The
higher-than-expected revenues, mainly attributed to the successful implementation of the
VAT, and the noticeable fiscal discipline have led to a significant fiscal surplus and further
reduction of public debt. In 2006, inflation has temporarily increased following the
introduction of the VAT and several administered price hikes; however, with the currency
board providing a credible nominal anchor, price growth significantly decelerated toward the
year-end and subsequent months.
In the first half of 2007, most of the macroeconomic indicators have continued their
positive trends. Export growth – although somewhat decelerated – remained strong, and
together with a buoyant level of investment in the private and the public sectors, is expected
to keep growth momentum at a high level. At this juncture, the authorities share staff’s
projection that the economic activity is about to expand this year at a magnitude of 6 percent.
Owing to the deceleration of exports and renewed expansion of imports, the current account
deficit is projected to slightly widen this year. Nevertheless, the financial account is expected
to demonstrate great vigor as foreign direct investment is expected to triple its 2006 level
mainly due to large-scale privatizations.1 On the fiscal side, in light of the increasing
spending (partly as a result of planned investment and the settlement of domestic claims), the
fading one-off effects of VAT introduction and declining international assistance, the
authorities project a limited fiscal relaxation.
As for the medium term, the authorities are in broad agreement with staff that
external conditions are likely to remain comfortable thus supporting domestic economic
activity. Yet, in view of the risks arising from the high external deficit and the increasing
spending needs, they acknowledge that greater efforts are required to keep the economy on a
solid path of growth and development. In this context, the authorities intend to step up and
accelerate the implementation of structural reforms with the aim of improving the

of GDP.

50
cooperation between the two Entities, while strengthening the coordination among all
government levels to facilitate consistent economic policies.
The authorities regret that the high growth rates were not reflected in significant
reduction of unemployment and poverty.2 They appreciate staff’s analysis on the labor
market and broadly concur with its main message that a more flexible wage structure, greater
labor mobility and appropriate training and education policies as well as more prudent labor
law enforcement would be instrumental in reducing the currently high unemployment rate.
The authorities are now reviewing the effectiveness of the current policies to promote
employment, and with the assistance of the World Bank, they intend to prepare a National
Development Plan for 2008-13, which will be a continuation of BiH’s medium-term
development strategy that runs until end-2007 and is part of the EU accession agenda.
Structural reforms and trade liberalization
The authorities agree with staff that preserving competitiveness is necessary to
contain external vulnerabilities. Yet, they note that the lack of political support exacerbated
by fragmented institutions have prevented them from more forcefully moving forward with
important structural reforms and thus contributed to the BiH’s low ranking among other
countries in the region in several transition indicators. Now, with the new government in
place, the authorities are prepared to accelerate reform momentum and boost competition and
efficiency in the markets. In this context, they note that significant progress has been
recorded this year with regard to the privatization process, particularly in Republika Srpska
(RS), which completed the sale of RS telecom (the second largest telecom company in BiH)
and a large oil refinery. At the Federation, although limited progress has been achieved so far
in this area, the authorities’ privatization plan for this year is rather ambitious and envisages
the sale of some of the entity’s most profitable companies. These include the engineering
firm Energoinvest, the construction company Hidrogradnja and the aluminum smelter
Aluminij Mostar, BiH’s largest exporter. The authorities underline their intention to use the
large proceeds from privatization to finance new investment projects, which they consider
necessary given the poor infrastructure condition.
As part of the strategy to develop the private sector, the authorities have also
progressed with reforms aimed at enhancing the business climate. In this regard, they
recently introduced a new countrywide system of business registration while business
inspections have been streamlined and consolidated.3 Moreover, the Anti-trust council is now
fully functional and EU-styled legislation is being enforced for all new mergers and market
entry.
Bosnia and Herzegovina remains committed to trade liberalization. In late 2006, BiH,
along with four other countries in the region, agreed to join an expanded Central European
Free-Trade Agreement (CEFTA). While the agreement still needs to be ratified by the

51
parliament (end of July), the authorities expect that it will boost import demand in several of
BiH’s key regional export markets.
Fiscal issues
In 2006, the authorities continued to implement prudent fiscal policy. Despite early
concerns regarding the transition of the tax system, they note with satisfaction that the VAT
implementation was successful as it generated significant revenues, well above previous
projections. This, together with a moderate decline in expenditures (as a share of GDP), led
to a considerable fiscal surplus of 3 percent of GDP, in the face of a continuous decline in the
international financial assistance, and also contributed to the improvement of BiH’s credit
rating. Looking ahead, the BiH authorities underline their intention to continue with fiscal
consolidation. They recognize that the public sector is large and inefficient and thus needs to
be reduced, yet in view of the increasing spending needs, inter alia due to EU integration and
significant domestic claims, they see merit in gradual adjustment.
The authorities perceive staff’s medium-term fiscal projections, which rely on the
assumption that policies remain un-changed, as overly pessimistic. They recognize that part
of the strong fiscal performance last year stemmed from one-off effects, however they are
confident that the acceleration of privatization, the projected strong economic growth and
their efforts to reduce the informal sector, will support the continuation of robust revenue
growth and therefore compensate for the increasing spending needs. According to their view,
the 2007 fiscal stance will indeed demonstrate some relaxation (compared to 2006); however,
it is deemed possible that the fiscal budget will still record a surplus.
As part of their efforts to streamline the public sector and contain expenditures, the
authorities have established a working group to review the wage structure at the public sector
with a view of finalizing the draft law and adopting it by the year-end. Moreover, the
authorities plan to consolidate the various laws on demobilized soldiers in order to abolish
duplicate benefits claims. The authorities are also confident that the adoption of the
government debt laws, which was already adopted by the State and RS and is pending for
approval at the Federation, would provide a firm framework that would ensure fiscal
consolidation over time.
Following a successful implementation of the VAT system, the authorities plan to
reform the direct tax system with a view of harmonizing and simplifying the tax schemes in
both Entities. In this regard, considerable progress has been made in RS in 2006 with the
adoption of the Law on Personal Income Tax and the Law on Corporate Income Tax and it is
expected that similar legislation will be adopted in the Federation this year. The authorities
recognize that such reform, which also envisages tax rate cuts in the Federation, would be
beneficial to promote job creation and to reduce the currently significant informal sector in
the economy. Therefore, they do not expect that it will have an adverse effect on the overall
revenue collection.

52
The authorities recognize the necessity to improve coordination to enhance the fiscal
position. In the absence of a legislative framework for the work of the National Fiscal
Council (NFC), a Budget Coordination Board (BCB) was formed,4 and it held regular
meetings throughout the process of preparation of the Budget Framework Papers for 2008-10
for the State and the Entities. The BCB agreed on a harmonized budget calendar for all
government levels and work is underway to harmonize the appropriate legal provisions.
Further improvement in the process of budget preparation will be achieved with the adoption
of the NFC law. In this regard, the authorities have prepared a draft of the NFC law and
intend to submit this to the parliament for its approval shortly. They realize that this is a first
step to improve fiscal coordination.
Monetary policy
In 2006, the dynamics of prices were largely affected by the VAT introduction at the
beginning of the year and certain hikes in administrative prices of electricity, gas and public
utilities in the Federation. Consequently, inflation accelerated in the first three quarters and
was accompanied by a sharp increase in nominal wage. However, with the currency board
providing a credible nominal anchor to the economy, the adjustment process to the new price
environment gradually diminished, and toward the end of the year price growth started to
decelerate. This trend continued in the first half of 2007 when the inflation rate reverted to
low levels of 1-2 percent in both Entities. At this juncture the Central Bank of Bosnia and
Herzegovina (CBBH) does not expect to change the reserve requirement (its main monetary
instrument), however it will continue to closely monitor market developments and will adjust
its policy instruments if needed.
The CBBH is confident that the observed high credit growth mainly reflects the
ongoing process of financial deepening and expects the steady expansion of credit to remain
significant, in line with regional trends, and without undermining financial stability. The
CBBH also notes that the inclusion, in 2007, of households and companies in the credit
registry would significantly improve risk management of lending institutions.
Financial stability issues
While the CBBH views the current financial system as sound, with some financial
indicators such as the Non-Performing Loans (NPL) and Return on Equity (RoE) showing
continuous improvement, it continues to take measures to improve its oversight on the
markets. In this regard, the CBBH established, in line with FSAP recommendations, a
Financial Stability Unit within the central bank, which is expected to provide, through the
issuance of financial stability reports, frequent assessments of the financial sector
developments and potential risks. That said, the CBBH acknowledges that there is scope for
ore policy actions to contain the remaining weaknesses. In this context, bank supervisors
have already started working on more strict loan classification with the intention of
introducing them in the next few months. The authorities support the FSAP recommendation
that banking agencies should follow up to relax the maturity-matching requirement between a

bank’s assets and liabilities so as to improve banks’ liquidity and thus weaken the link
between credit expansion and foreign borrowing.
The authorities broadly concur that a single, independent, and effective bank
supervisor at the state level, either at the CBBH or as a separate institution, would be more
effective in safeguarding financial stability, with greater cross-border cooperation, and will
be consistent with the general approach of creating single economic space in BiH.
Nevertheless, they underline that the decision on the final setup of bank supervision has
significant political implications.
As part of the efforts to strengthen the economic and financial cooperation between
the European Union and Bosnia and Herzegovina, the CBBH has signed early this year the
Protocol of the Eurosystem Needs Assessment Programme with the European Central Bank
and the European Commission to BiH. The aim of the program is to assess the current
functioning of the CBBH in various areas, including financial stability, statistics, internal
audit and economic analysis and research, and eventually provide recommendations on the
necessary reforms that are needed to match the CBBH operations with best practice of the
EU central banks. While awaiting for the final solution on the bank supervision structure, it
was also agreed that the assessment would include a comprehensive examination of the
coordination of banking supervision with the Banking Agencies from both Entities with a
view of improving the CBBH’s activities in this domain.
Statistics
The authorities are cognizant that more remains to be done to improve the quality of
statistics, particularly real sector statistics, government finances and the balance of payment.
In this regard, they are making efforts to improve the coordination and cooperation between
the statistics agencies of the Entities and the State to construct reliable data on an aggregate
level. This step, together with the assistance of the Fund’s statistics department, has recently
allowed them to produce an assessment of GDP by expenditure approach. The authorities
highly appreciate the Fund’s assistance in this area and look forward to the completion of the
data ROSC, which they intend to follow up on.
Going forward....
The authorities see the accession to the EU as the main political objective and attach
enormous importance to the process. They have successfully completed the technical
negotiations on the Stabilization and Association Agreement (December 2006) and the
noticeable progress in reform implementation has made the BiH economy more compatible
and integrated with the EU and the region. That said, the authorities acknowledge that there
are significant challenges down the road, also in view of the closure of the Office of the High
Representative (OHR) foreseen for next year. Thus, they see merit in the continuation of
assistance from the international community and reiterate their intention to maintain close
cooperation with the Fund in the years ahead.
