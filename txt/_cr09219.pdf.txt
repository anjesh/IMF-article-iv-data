Executive Summary
Economic growth has been high over the last two years, fueled by oil-financed
government spending and underpinned by improved security conditions. The global
crisis has had no major impact on the domestic economy, given limited external linkages via
trade, investment or finance. The key adverse impact has been through lower oil prices,
which, if persistent, could reduce the sustainable level of public spending. While non-oil
growth is expected to remain relatively high, the medium-term outlook is very uncertain, and
contingent upon the path of petroleum revenue, the security situation, the magnitude and
quality of public spending, and the progress on business-enabling reforms.
The key policy challenge for Timor-Leste is to manage its petroleum wealth in a
sustainable fashion that stimulates the growth of the non-oil sector and supports
poverty reduction. Along with soaring petroleum revenue, government spending has
increased rapidly over the last two years. While this reflects efforts to address pressing needs
and secure social cohesion, it cannot continue at the present pace. Staff welcomed the
authorities’ intention to moderate the speed of fiscal expansion as signaled in the 2010
Budget circular, and urged them to bring spending in line with the sustainable level by 2012.
Fiscal prudence is also needed to support external sustainability and help avoid real
exchange rate appreciation. Official dollarization has helped contain inflation expectations,
and staff recommended that the regime be maintained. To boost competitiveness, the mission
underscored the need for productivity-enhancing public spending and reforms to improve the
investment climate.
The mission stressed that the Petroleum Fund should remain the cornerstone for public
financial management. The forthcoming revision to its law, intended to widen the Fund’s
investment portfolio, should leave intact the Fund’s basic principles of transparency,
accountability, and long-run sustainability. Any foreign borrowing, which the authorities are
contemplating as an alternative to tapping the Fund, should be subject to these same
principles. Staff recommended careful prioritization, sequencing, assessment and monitoring
of public works, in line with a medium-term budget framework.
The financial sector remains at an embryonic stage. Commercial banks reach only a small
part of the population, and place the bulk of deposits in foreign assets. Credit growth has
stalled, dragged by a high share of nonperforming loans and the lack of clearly defined and
enforceable property rights. Staff recommended the continued strengthening of financial
supervision, and swift passage of legislation and reforms to promote financial development,
including the land law.

I. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
1.
The Timorese economy has been growing rapidly over the last two years. TimorLeste remains one of the least developed countries in the world, with 50 percent of the
population living in poverty in 2007 (Figure 1, Table 1, and Annex V). However, a marked

2.
The global crisis has had limited immediate impact on Timor-Leste. Foreign
investment outside the oil sector and non-oil exports remain very small. Also, the financial
sector is at an embryonic stage, and the foreign parents of the three commercial banks are in
a strong financial position. 1 Thus, the key channels through which the crisis has spread
across the globe—trade, investment, and finance—have played little role in Timor-Leste.
Foreign aid flows have increased, and growth remains driven by public spending. As in other
oil exporting countries, the key adverse impact has been through lower oil prices and a sharp
fall in petroleum revenues (Box 1). If persistent, lower oil prices will reduce the sustainable
level of public spending.
3.
Inflation has declined, along with international food prices. Pushed by higher
commodity prices, inflation surged from 2006 to mid-2008, peaking at over 10 percent yearon-year (y/y). Food prices, with a weight of 60 percent in the CPI, played a key role. The
correction in commodity prices since then has led to a sharp reduction in headline inflation to
2.7 percent y/y in March 2009, almost converging with non-food inflation (Figure 2). The
depreciation of the Indonesian and Australian currencies vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar has led to a
real exchange rate appreciation (Box 2), and helped abate inflationary pressures.

1

Australia and New Zealand Bank (ANZ) and Caixa Geral de Depositos (a state-owned Portuguese bank) were
included by Global Finance (February 2009) among the world’s 50 safest banks. The Indonesian state-owned
Bank Mandiri is also sound, with high levels of capital and liquidity.

5
4.
Petroleum revenue soared in 2008. Petroleum-related revenue (including interest
from petroleum savings) almost doubled in 2008 to $2.4 billion (about 5 times non-oil GDP).
The main driver was the surge in international oil prices in the first half of 2008. But two
other factors contributed: a 15 percent increase in production volumes, and a doubling of
Petroleum Fund earnings on the back of a higher base and a conservative investment strategy
(all in U.S. government bonds) that generated a 6.9 percent return (Box 3). Higher oil/gas
revenue boosted the central government surplus to 384 percent of non-oil GDP in 2008,
while Petroleum Fund assets reached $4.2 billion and have continued rising in 2009.

Central government spending increased substantially in 2008, reflecting efforts to
address pressing needs and secure
social cohesion. A key contributor was

on a cash basis, spending was broadly
in line with its sustainable level––defined as the sum of non-oil revenue and the estimated
sustainable income (ESI) from petroleum––and withdrawals from the Petroleum Fund have

ESI is calculated as the level of withdrawals from the Petroleum Fund that would stabilize the net present
value of the Fund’s assets. The calculation is updated each year as an input for the budget, and by law must be
based on prudent oil price and volume assumptions.

7.
The financial sector is at an early stage of development. The three commercial
banks, which are branches of foreign parents, reach only a small segment of the population.
While deposits have been increasing on the back of faster growth in the non-oil economy,
private sector credit has been stagnant since late 2005, and the spread between lending and
deposit rates is high (about 11 percent). Loans account for under one-third of bank assets,
with surplus funds held mainly in liquid assets abroad. A large share of loans is in arrears
(27 percent), but covered twice over by provisions. 5 Key impediments to credit are the lack
of clear property rights and ineffectual contract enforcement. In this environment,
microfinance has shown considerable potential (see Annex VI). A state-owned microfinance
institution (IMfTL) has experienced substantial growth in credit, but remains a small player.

See Table 5, footnote 1.

As branches of foreign parents, commercial banks are not subject to capital adequacy requirements. IMfTL
has capital well above the regulatory minimum.

II. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
8.
Discussions focused on the outlook and the policies needed to ensure mediumterm macroeconomic and financial stability, promote private sector growth, and
support poverty reduction. In particular, the discussions centered on:
•

the near and medium-term projections;

•

ensuring fiscal sustainability and improving the efficiency and quality of public
spending;

•

policies to maintain the stability and promote the development of the financial sector;

•

external sustainability and reforms to spur competitiveness and private investment.
A. Outlook and Risks

9.
The near-term outlook for the Timorese economy is still positive, though marked
by a sharp decline in the fiscal and external surpluses. Staff project a slowdown in central
government expenditure growth to about 13 percent in 2009 and 4 percent in 2010.6
However, spending would remain above the sustainable level. Real non-oil GDP growth
would moderate to about 7½ percent in 2009–10, supported by public spending and private
investment. Inflation is projected to stay at low single digit levels. Despite their recent
recovery, oil prices are expected to remain below their 2008 average, triggering a sharp
decline in the fiscal and current account surpluses.

6

The 2010 projection is based on the limit set for the 2010 Budget ($637 million for the general government;
$622 million for the central government). The actual increase in cash spending in 2009 is likely to be larger than
reported in Table 3.

10.
For the medium term, staff projects moderating but still high economic growth,
and a slight improvement in the non-oil fiscal balance:
•

Absent a well-defined medium-term budget framework, projections are complicated
by unclear timing and cost of spending initiatives. In the staff’s baseline (“strong
policy”) scenario, public spending is projected to peak in 2010 and return to the
sustainable spending path by 2012. The non-oil fiscal deficit would halve between
2008 and 2014, to about 45 percent of non-oil GDP, while Petroleum Fund assets
would continue expanding. The scenario also assumes significant improvement in the
business environment and the quality and composition of public spending. This would
support economic growth of about 6–7 percent per year over 2011–14, as growth
converges to long-term fundamentals (productivity and labor supply). Headline
inflation should remain low, barring any large external shocks. The current account
surplus would fall along with petroleum revenues, unless new oil/gas fields come on
stream. Merchandise imports are projected to fall as a share of non-oil GDP,
reflecting less import-intensive public spending. Non-oil exports would remain small.
With donor budgets under pressure and an improving security situation, external
assistance is assumed to decline over the medium term.

•

In an alternative, “weak policy” scenario, which is based on an extrapolation of recent
(2006–08) public spending trends and assumes no major reforms to improve the
business climate, non-oil GDP growth would be lower, government spending would
continue to diverge from the sustainable level, the non-oil deficit would continue to
increase, and the Petroleum Fund would eventually be depleted.

11.
The medium-term outlook is highly uncertain, with important risks on the
upside and downside. Key uncertainties pertain to the path of oil and gas revenue, which
depends on both volatile international prices and still uncertain production potential; security

and political stability; the magnitude and quality of public spending; and the pace and
significance of reforms to improve the business environment.
12.
The authorities broadly agreed with the staff’s near-term outlook, but were
more optimistic about medium-term growth. In particular, they noted that reform efforts,
well-targeted spending, and private investment will support double-digit real GDP growth.
They were also optimistic about the prospects for revenue from future oil, gas, and other
mineral developments.
B. Fiscal Policy
13.
Oil and gas provide the country with considerable wealth, although not enough
to make it rich. The net present value of the country’s proven petroleum wealth, comprising

10
the Petroleum Fund balance and discounted future revenue streams, is estimated at about
$15.2 billion (about $14,000 per capita). 7
14.
The key fiscal challenge for Timor-Leste is to manage its petroleum wealth in a
sustainable fashion that stimulates non-oil growth and supports poverty reduction.
Achieving these objectives requires a medium-term strategy to: (i) ensure the sustainability
and improve the quality of spending; (ii) strengthen fiscal revenue; and (iii) improve public
financial management.
Sustainability and Quality of Public Spending
15.
Staff welcomed the authorities’ intention to moderate the pace of fiscal
expansion. The 2010 envelope is consistent with the staff’s “strong policy” scenario. It
entails significant cuts in goods and services (30 percent) and minor capital (65 percent) and
no change in outlays for wages and salaries relative to the 2009 Budget, while allowing for
an increase in capital investment (most of which is contractually committed to a large
electricity project).
16.
The mission urged the authorities to bring public spending in line with the
sustainable level by 2012. Spending in 2009–10 is projected to exceed the sustainable level
by 15–20 percent. This may be necessary to accommodate existing contracts. However, oneoff expenditures—such as payments to resettle displaced persons—and lower commodity
prices (which allow for a reduction in rice subsidies) generate opportunities for considerable
future savings. A continued commitment to wage restraint would also be helpful. This should
allow spending to be brought back to the sustainable path by 2012, while:
•

Keeping spending on a smooth upward path. More rapid increases in spending, as
illustrated in the staff’s weak policy scenario, could eventually deplete the country’s
petroleum wealth, forcing the government to engage in large-scale borrowing or
drastically cut spending. This could undermine private investment and growth.

•

Reducing the need for larger adjustments in the future, as this would help boost the
Petroleum Fund assets and their considerable interest income.

•

Providing ample space to address immediate social and security needs as well as for
priority infrastructure spending.

17.
Public spending should be prioritized and targeted to promote growth and
reduce poverty. Recent increases in spending have provided a significant boost to aggregate
demand and employment. Also, transfers to resettle internally displaced people and rice
7

The figure would of course go up if new oil/gas fields come on stream.

11
subsidies have helped strengthen peace and stability. Going forward, a key challenge will be
to improve public spending efficiency and to strengthen transparency and monitoring to
reduce the risk of abuse and corruption. Spending on health, education, security, and
infrastructure should be prioritized (see Annex V). Transfers and subsidies should be reduced
and diverted toward more efficient and welfare-enhancing uses, such as the expansion of the
cash-for-work program and pensions to the elderly. Subsidy policies, including for food and
electricity, should consider their distortionary impact and include exit strategies. The mission
recommended adopting a tariff structure for electricity aimed at full recovery of operational
costs, with concessions only for the neediest.
18.
The authorities noted the temporary nature of recent spending increases, and
stressed their commitment to fiscal sustainability. They argued that rapid spending
increases to date reflected improvements in execution capacity and were justified by security
and other pressing needs. They did not commit to the staff’s recommended fiscal path
beyond 2010, but were confident that revenue from new oil/gas fields or other mineral
resources will increase sustainable spending levels above current projections.
Revenue Generation
19.
The mission recommended measures to boost fiscal revenue. Staff welcomed
recent efforts by the authorities to assess and optimize the taxation of oil and gas (Box 5).
Despite the tax rate cuts implemented in mid-2008, domestic tax revenue increased in 2008
along with an expanded base. However, at about 8 percent, the tax to non-oil GDP ratio is
lower than in other low and middle-income oil exporting countries and the low-income
country group as a whole (chart below and Box 3). Staff encouraged the authorities to step up
efforts to improve tax administration and combat evasion, for instance by reconciling
customs and income tax information. Broadening the tax base by rationalizing investment
incentives should also be considered.

for managing the country’s oil-based resources. The Petroleum Fund insulates spending
from volatile revenue flows, provides a framework for transparency and accountability,
promotes long-run sustainability, and reduces pressures on the economy’s absorption
capacity (Box 2). According to the Fund’s law, limits on its investment portfolio must be
revisited in 2010; the authorities are considering a more diversified investment strategy as
well as other possible changes to the law. Staff suggested moving cautiously, to allow time
for gaining experience in managing riskier assets. The authorities stated that any reform to
the Fund law would leave intact its basic principles.
21.
Any foreign borrowing should be subject to public scrutiny and its effective cost
carefully weighed. Some elements in government are considering borrowing from
multilateral or bilateral official sources to fund infrastructure projects, as an alternative to
tapping the Petroleum Fund. While the impact on the country’s net wealth would be the
same, foreign loans could be cost-effective if based on concessional terms and accompanied
by technical assistance. The mission recommended that any such borrowing: (i) be
transparent and subject to parliamentary approval; and (ii) takes carefully into account all
terms and conditions of the loan, including non-interest costs.
22.
Staff welcomed the authorities’ efforts to improve public financial management.
These include moving to cash-based budgeting, adopting monitorable performance targets,
introducing a macroeconomic framework for medium-term projections to help guide policy,
and preparing a strategic development plan that would set out the key policy objectives. To
make this plan operational, the mission recommended: (i) subjecting project design to
prioritization and careful cost-benefit analyses, including of recurrent costs; (ii) introducing a
medium-term fiscal framework with clear links to the budget; (iii) improving the monitoring
and auditing of projects; and (iv) stepping up capacity building on procurement, budget
execution, and auditing at the line ministry level, and ahead of any decentralization to
district-level governments. The authorities requested an extension of the IMF-funded
treasury advisor, a fiscal Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC) mission,
and a Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) assessment.
C. Financial Sector
23.
The mission recommended the continued strengthening of financial supervision.
In particular, staff pointed to the need to strengthen data collection and analysis for
prudential supervision, as well as on-site and off-site surveillance methods. Staff also
encouraged the authorities to strengthen cooperation, including through memoranda of
understanding, with the home supervisors of foreign banks.
24.
The mission encouraged the passage of legislation and reforms needed to
promote financial sector stability and development. Priorities include the land law, the

13
central bank law to safeguard the Banking and Payments Authority’s (BPA) operational
autonomy, and passing other important financial sector legislation (banking, payments, antimoney laundering) and insurance regulations. The authorities reiterated their commitment to
table these reforms, but observed that the country is young and faces a very large institutionbuilding and legal framework agenda. They also expressed interest in providing subsidized
credit, either directly or in cooperation with private financials. Staff recommended that any
public sector involvement in the financial sector be subject to transparency checks and the
same regulatory and supervisory standards as commercial banking activities.
D. Competitiveness, External Sustainability, and Exchange Rate Policy
25.
Given official dollarization, fiscal policy is essential to ensure external
sustainability. Standard analyses of exchange rate misalignment are neither feasible nor very
meaningful for Timor-Leste. The lack of data leaves little scope for econometric techniques.
The current account is mainly driven by oil/gas revenue developments, and is therefore likely
to be relatively inelastic to the real exchange rate. 8 The medium-term sustainability of the
current account is primarily a function of fiscal policy: keeping spending on a sustainable
path supports external sustainability directly, by reducing imports, and indirectly, by helping
to avoid a real exchange rate appreciation through demand-driven inflation.
26.
A key problem for Timor-Leste is weak structural competitiveness. Broader
indexes of competitiveness and ease of doing business indicate that the business environment
remains uncompetitive, even by the standards of other low income countries (Box 1). In
addition to boosting productivity-enhancing public spending, staff and the authorities agreed
on the need to pass the pending land law, resolve conflicting claims on land, and improve
contract enforcement through judicial reform and the adoption of an alternative dispute
resolution framework. These are essential steps to promote private investment and bank
lending. Lighter business regulations, including simplified registration and licensing
procedures, are also important. The mission welcomed the authorities’ initiative to establish a
one-stop-shop for investors. The commitment to public wage restraint in the 2010 Budget
envelope should also help private sector development by lowering the cost of attracting
skilled labor (Figure 4).
27.
The authorities remain committed to retaining the current exchange rate
regime. Official dollarization has served the country well: it has provided a strong nominal
anchor for inflation expectations and eliminated the possibility of speculative attacks on the
domestic currency. The introduction of a new currency, particularly under a flexible
8

Petroleum revenue is by far the largest source of income and the main driver of imports. The non-oil export
sector is very small and concentrated in crop commodities (particularly coffee) that tend to be largely
determined by supply factors. Among the main components of the current account, tourism is likely to be the
most sensitive to the real exchange rate.

14
exchange rate regime, would require the existence of relatively developed financial markets,
entail the risk of currency substitution (at least initially), and drive scarce administrative
capacity away from more pressing needs.
E. Statistical Issues
28.
Data provision continues to have shortcomings, especially on national accounts,
that significantly hamper macroeconomic analysis and surveillance (Annex IV).
Moderate progress has been made, however, to enhance data quality and provision. In
particular, staff noted recent progress in the collection and coverage of monetary and
financial statistics, and welcomed the recent publication of monetary and balance of
payments statistics. The mission encouraged the authorities to allocate sufficient resource to
improve economic data, to give priority to annual household income and expenditure surveys
as an essential input for constructing expenditure-based national accounts, and to participate
in the IMF’s General Data Dissemination System.
III. STAFF APPRAISAL
29.
Non-oil GDP growth will remain high in the near term, with little immediate
adverse effects from the global crisis. Rapid increases in government spending, together
with improved security and a good harvest, pushed non-oil GDP growth up in 2007–08.
Growth is expected to remain high in the near term, supported by public spending and private
investment, while limited external linkages via trade, investment or finance will keep the
non-oil economy relatively isolated from the global crisis. In the medium run, growth will
gradually converge to supply-side fundamentals. The decline in commodity prices since their
peak in mid-2008 will narrow Timor-Leste’s fiscal and external position over the medium
term, unless new oil/gas fields come on stream.
30.
Public spending should return to a sustainable path over the medium term, and
be targeted to growth promotion and poverty reduction. With public spending already in
2009 above the sustainable level, further rapid increases would eventually deplete the
Petroleum Fund. The recently announced moderation in government spending growth,
including wages, is welcome. Consistent with it, government spending should be brought in
line with a sustainable path as soon as existing commitments allow. The efficiency and
targeting of spending should also be improved, so as to create room for strengthened
spending on health, education, infrastructure, and poverty-reducing transfers.
31.
Fiscal prudence is also needed to support competitiveness and external
sustainability. Moderate public spending increases would keep the current account on a
sustainable path and reduce pressure on the real exchange rate. Productivity-enhancing
spending, and reforms to improve the business climate, are crucial to boost competitiveness.
Official dollarization has helped keep inflation under control, and should be maintained.

15
32.
Staff recommends that the Petroleum Fund remain at the center of petroleumbased revenue management. Its key principles—that all petroleum revenues go to the Fund,
and that withdrawals go through the budget and are consistent with wealth preservation for
future generations—should remain intact, as they safeguard transparency and sustainability,
and protect spending from revenue volatility. A medium-term expenditure framework should
be introduced, and capital investment projects should be carefully prioritized and costed. Any
foreign borrowing should be subject to Parliamentary approval and proper justification.
33.
Continued efforts are needed to strengthen financial sector supervision and
promote financial development. The banking sector is small and has not been adversely
affected by the global financial turmoil, but it is important to step up measures to improve
financial supervision, strengthen cooperation with home supervisors of foreign banks, and
pass legislation to safeguard the Banking and Payments Authority’s autonomy. Reforms to
enhance property rights are also needed to promote financial development.
34.
Staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12month cycle.

Box 1. The Impact of Oil Price Shocks on Oil Producing Countries
A cross-country study by the Fund’s Fiscal Affairs Department analyzes fiscal vulnerability in oil
producing countries to sharp declines in oil prices.1
Increases in oil prices until mid-2008 improved overall fiscal positions in oil producing
countries (OPCs). The sample of 21 mostly low and middle-income OPCs recorded growing fiscal
surpluses between 2003 and 2008, when average annual oil prices increased from about US$30 to
nearly US$100 per barrel. The average overall surplus for the sample of countries rose from
2.6 percent of non-oil GDP in 2003 to 15.0 percent of non-oil GDP in 2007, and is estimated to have
increased further to 31.4 percent of non-oil GDP in 2008.
In contrast, the average nonoil primary position
deteriorated. On average,
OPC governments spent about
half of the increase in oil
revenue accumulated between
2004 and 2008. Consequently,
the average non-oil primary
deficit increased from around
20 percent of non-oil GDP in
2004 to nearly 30 percent in
2008. Primary expenditure
increases during this period
were driven mainly by capital
expenditure, which grew from
an average of 15 percent of
non-oil GDP to 30 percent.

A fall in oil prices could dramatically worsen overall fiscal positions. Based on a simple
adjustment of oil revenue and GDP, keeping ratios of non-oil revenues and total spending to non-oil
GDP unchanged, a drop in oil prices to $60 per barrel would cause the average overall fiscal surplus
of the sample OPCs to fall by over 20 percent of non-oil GDP.
Timor-Leste is the most oil-dependent country among the OPCs and therefore also the most
exposed to lower oil prices. The Petroleum Fund has sheltered the budget from large fluctuations in
oil prices. However, in 2009, government withdrawals from the Petroleum Fund are for the first time
expected to exceed the sustainable spending guideline required to preserve the net present value of oil
wealth.

Box 2. Exchange Rate, Competitiveness, and External Sustainability Assessment
Price competitiveness has weakened and significant structural disincentives to private investment remain.
The nominal effective exchange rate (NEER)
has appreciated sharply over the past
12 months, mainly reflecting the depreciation in
the Indonesian rupee and the Australian dollar.
Relative prices have fallen since mid-2008 along
with lower imported food prices, but this was
more than offset by the marked NEER
appreciation. Thus, the core-CPI-based real
effective exchange rate (REER) has moved
largely in tandem with the NEER. Steadily low
core inflation indicates that price pressures have
resulted mainly from global or supply-side
factors. However, anecdotal evidence suggests
that average wages are high in comparison with
Indonesia, the main trading partner, and high
public sector pay rates also put pressure on
private wages (Figure 4).
Institutional competitiveness has fallen further
behind according to global indicators. Surveys
have consistently ranked Timor-Leste towards the
bottom end of business friendliness and global
competitiveness. Since 2007, it dropped another
two places on the doing business and global
competitiveness score boards.
On current policies, external stability would
be maintained. In 2006–08, current account
surpluses were above their long-run sustainable
level. Those surpluses largely reflected
temporary factors, and in particular the boom in
international oil/gas prices. Over the medium
run, current account surpluses will decline and
converge to the sustainable level.

Box 3. Petroleum Fund Performance and Outlook
According to the Petroleum Fund (PF) Law, all Timor-Leste’s income from oil and gas production
must go to the PF and withdrawals can only be made to the state budget. Based on the Norwegian
model, the PF is invested entirely abroad.
The medium-term evolution of the PF will depend mainly on oil output and prices, and the rate of
withdrawals.
•

Oil and gas production is expected to stay near current levels for the next several years but
revenue is highly sensitive to prices (with some lag). From current levels, a $10/barrel fall in
the price of crude oil reduces Timorese government receipts by about 25 percent.

Figures for 2009 based on budget but more recent data point to ESI
being about $50m higher than depicted.
Reflecting higher oil prices, ESI has
increased substantially since the
first estimate for FY2005/06 and withdrawals have so far remained within the limit. With
spending continuing to increase, however, this year is likely to be the first where withdrawals
exceed ESI.

19

Box 4. Outlook for Oil/Gas Production
Timor-Leste at present has only one producing field, Bayu-Undan, located in an off-shore area
(JPDA) subject to revenue-sharing with Australia. Based on conservative estimates, official
projections have production levels from this field gradually tapering off before coming to an end by
2023. Remaining revenue to Timor-Leste is estimated at $11 billion in net present value.

The Greater Sunrise project could potentially

significant revenue would take almost a
decade to materialize. Kitan, a more recent
discovery, could come into production
already by 2011 but is only about 5 percent
the size of Bayu-Undan. More fields could
still be discovered but there is considerable
uncertainty.

Box 5. Timor-Leste’s Petroleum Fiscal Regimes
A complex set of fiscal regimes presents major challenges in both implementation and
administration. Timor-Leste has no final maritime boundary in the Timor Sea, but has three
interlocking treaties with Australia covering the Joint Petroleum Development Area (JPDA) and the
overlapping Sunrise unit area. A combination of production sharing and taxation generates revenue
for Timor-Leste. The treaty architecture defines different production-sharing contract regimes and
taxation regimes, covering Bayu-Undan, the Sunrise fields, the remainder of the JPDA, and areas of
exclusive jurisdiction.
The IMF’s Fiscal Affairs Department recently provided technical assistance on the
administration and implementation of petroleum fiscal regimes. It was found that the fiscal regimes
have generally been implemented and administered well, but continued efforts are needed to
maximize benefits from future petroleum operations.

Sources: Data provided by the Timor-Leste authorities; and Fund staff estimates.
1/ Includes locally paid compensation of UN peacekeeping mission staff.
2/ Excludes oil/gas sector.
3/ Includes autonomous agencies and quasi-fiscal expenditure by donors outside the central government budget. The revenue decline in
2005 reflects the creation of the Petroleum Fund to which all oil revenue now accrues. Income from the fund and donor assistance finances the deficit.
4/ Excludes currency holdings by the public, for which no data are available.
5/ Simple average of three spot prices; Dated Brent, West Texas Intermediate, and the Dubai Fateh.
6/ Figure for 2004 refers to the Timor-Sea account, which preceded the August 2005 establishment of the Petroleum Fund.

Sources: Timor-Leste authorities; and Fund staff estimates.
1/ Fiscal year: July-June until June 2007; calendar year starting 2008. Central Government includes subsidies to Autonomous Agencies.
Revenue from government rice sales (estimated at $17 million in 2008 and $10 million in 2009) is excluded and only the net subsidy
included in recurrent expenditure.
2/ The budget moved toward a cash basis in 2008 and the authorities stopped reporting commitments. Of the $528 million reported as spent in 2008,
an estimated $80 million was actually paid out in 2009, with spending under the 2008 budget allowed to continue in early 2009 as a transitional
measure before fully applying cash-based principles.
3/ Includes allocations for BPA capitalization ($10.5 million in 2006/07).
4/ Cash expenditure includes carry-over expenditure from previous years (the reporting of which was not disaggregated prior to 2008).
5/ Defined as overall balance minus petroleum revenue.
6/ Permanent income from oil and gas, estimated according to the Petroleum Fund law for each budget.
7/ Adds non-petroleum revenue to estimated sustainable income from petroleum.

Exchange Rate Arrangements
On January 24, 2000, the U.S. dollar was adopted as the official currency of then
East Timor by the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor
(UNTAET). This arrangement has been maintained after Timor-Leste’s
independence on May 20, 2002. At present, the monetary authority does not
undertake foreign exchange transactions; they are handled by commercial banks
on the basis of rates quoted in the international markets.

VIII. Article IV Consultations
The 2008 Article IV consultation discussions with the authorities were held
during April 16–30, 2008; the consultation was concluded on June 25, 2008. The
Public Information Note may be found at
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pn/2008/pn0878.htm.
IX.

Technical Assistance
Since late 1999, a significant amount of technical assistance has been
provided by the Fund as part of the international community’s efforts to

3
reconstruct the Timor-Leste economy. The Fund’s technical assistance has
focused on establishing key economic institutions (especially fiscal and
monetary authorities) essential for macroeconomic management, as well as
on developing local capacity to manage them. It also played a key role in
the adoption of a new currency arrangement based on the U.S. dollar.
Since late 1999, Timor-Leste has been one of the largest recipients of Fund
technical assistance.
FAD: A series of multi-topic FAD missions took place early on to establish and
develop the Central Fiscal Authority (CFA, February 2000), which developed into
the Ministry of Planning and Finance. Assistance was provided to develop budget
preparation, establish tax policy and administration, strengthen treasury and
expenditure management, and advise on oil sector fiscal regimes. Long-term
resident advisors were assigned to the Ministry of Planning and Finance and the
Revenue Service of Timor-Leste to cover a wide range of issues, partly under a
cost sharing arrangement with the UN. Over August 2004–July 2005, a FAD
resident advisor assisted in the design and establishment of the Petroleum Fund,
which started operations in August 2005. A FAD resident advisor to the Treasurer
of the ministry finance started work in December 2006 to help strengthen
expenditure management, reporting and budget execution—after a short break, a
replacement has continued this work since July 2008. In 2007, a FAD TA mission
provided guidance for future reform of the non-oil tax regime. In April 2009 a
FAD technical assistance mission provided advice on implementation of the fiscal
regimes for petroleum.
LEG: A number of LEG missions have been to Timor-Leste to advise the
authorities on key fiscal and financial legislation. These included tax legislation,
the budget and financial management law, and banking regulations (relating to the
monetary authority, the banking system, and the payments system). Jointly with
MFD (now MCM), technical assistance has been provided to assist in drafting an
Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT)
Law. LEG has also provided assistance, in collaboration with FAD, for the
drafting of the Petroleum Fund Act and tax consolidation, and in collaboration
with MCM, for the drafting of the Central Bank Law.
MCM: A large number of missions took place early on to establish and develop
the Central Payments Office (CPO, January 2000), which was transformed
subsequently into the Banking and Payments Authority (BPA) (November 2001).
Assistance was provided to establish a payments system, prepare banking
legislation, and develop key functions of the monetary authority, including
banking supervision, asset management, accounting, and organization and

4
management. Assistance was also provided on the introduction of a dollar-based
currency system and to issue domestic coins to supplement the use of U.S. dollar
coins. More recently, assistance has been provided to (i) draft the insurance law
and develop a framework for insurance supervision; (ii) strengthen banking
supervision; (iii) address a broad range of issues related to AML/CFT; (iv)
establish and train the investment unit responsible for managing petroleum fund
assets (funded by Norway, a resident adviser commenced in March 2005 and,
after a break due to contract renegotiations, a replacement continued this work
from November 2008); (v) prepare for the establishment of the central bank; (vi)
design of a more effective organizational structure at the BPA; and (vii)
modernize payment systems, and accounting for the Petroleum Fund. In addition,
up until 2006 long-term resident advisors, including on banking supervision,
payments, and accounting, have been assigned to the BPA under a cost-sharing
arrangement with the UN. A long-term resident advisor assisted the BPA General
Manager from February 2005 until February 2008, with that support subsequently
provided on a peripatetic basis and funded by a Japanese grant.
STA: A multi-sector statistical mission took place in November 2000 to assess
the availability and quality of official macroeconomic data, and help establish the
Statistic Division of the Ministry of Planning and Finance. Assistance was
provided by long term statistical advisors during November 2001-October 2005.
Since 2007, a peripatetic statistical advisor has provided assistance for improving
data compilation and developing local capacity to prepare balance of payments
statistics—responsibility for this was transferred to the BPA in 2007. Provisional
annual balance of payments statements for 2006 and 2007 were published in
December 2008. In early 2008 a monetary and financial statistics (MFS) mission
helped introduce the standardized report forms (SRFs) for reporting monetary data
to the IMF and an integrated monetary database. Subsequently, Timor-Leste has,
for the first time, been able to publish a country page in IFS. A March 2009
follow-up MFS mission assisted in expanding the institutional coverage of
depository corporations to include microfinance institutions and in revising the
call report form that will be used to collect balance sheet data.

Resident Representative
A resident representative office was established in Dili in August 2000. The
current resident representative, Mr. Tobias Rasmussen, assumed the post in
February 2006. The resident representative office closed at end-June 2009.

5
ANNEX II. TIMOR-LESTE: RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
(As of May 25, 2009)
1.
Timor-Leste joined the World Bank Group on July 23, 2002. It became eligible for
IDA assistance on October 9, 2002. Thus far, there has been no lending to Timor-Leste,
reflecting the authorities’ policy to avoid external borrowing, including concessional loans.
However, the World Bank has been actively involved in the reconstruction and development
of the economy since late 1999, by playing a key catalytic role in mobilizing and coordinating
international assistance to Timor-Leste. Timor-Leste joined IFC in September 2004 and,
together with the Pacific Enterprise Development Facility, an office was opened in Dili in
2006.
2.
During the transition to independence, the World Bank’s involvement centered
around its role as trustee and co-manager of the Trust Fund for East Timor (TFET), which
was established in December 1999 as a vehicle to provide grant assistance for reconstruction
activities and economic development in Timor-Leste. Under the TFET, which is co-managed
with the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the World Bank has administered projects relating
to social services (especially health and education), agriculture, private sector development,
community development and governance, economic capacity building, and petroleum sector
development. 1
3.
In addition to its involvement through the TFET, the World Bank played a key role in
mobilizing budgetary assistance for the post-independence period through an annual multidonor budget support operation. The Transition Support Program (TSP) from FY 2003 to
2005, was followed by the Consolidation Support Program (CSP) to FY2006/07, to reflect
the shift from post-conflict transition to consolidation of gains made thus far. The TSP
programs brought about $30 million in budget support annually with about $5 million
financed by IDA, and the balance financed by 9 bilateral partners. The CSP program brought
around $10 million in budget support annually, with about $0.5 million financed by IDA.
Both the TSP and the CSP programs focused on three thematic areas: (1) good governance,
including developing a legal framework for governance and the judiciary and strengthening
public expenditure management; (2) service delivery for poverty reduction, particularly in
education and health; and (3) job creation, especially through private sector development,
agriculture, and improvements in basic infrastructure.

1

Pledges to the TFET were made by 12 donors, including the European Commission and the World Bank, with
the total amount of funds reaching $178 million. This comprises donors’ contributions of $167 million
(including $10 million by the World Bank) and investment income of $9 million. TFET projects are expected to
wind down by end-2010.

6
4.
The World Bank has also provided analytical and advisory services, including through
a Country Economic Memorandum, a Poverty Assessment, a Public Expenditure
Management and Accountability Note, a Public Expenditure Review, an Education Sector
Review, and a Paper on Strengthening the Institutions of Governance in Timor-Leste. The
“Doing Business” report for 2006 featured Timor-Leste for the first time and was updated for
2007 and for 2008. The World Bank has also produced short, just-in-time reports on Key
Lessons from the Creation of Veterans Policy in Timor-Leste (September 2008), Policy Note
on Population Growth and its Implications in Timor-Leste (October 2008), and Timor-Leste:
Poverty in a Young Nation (November 2008).
5.
In July 2005 the World Bank adopted a Country Assistance Strategy for FY 2006–08.
The International Development Association (IDA) and the International Finance Corporation
(IFC) are currently preparing an Interim Strategy Note, scheduled to be presented to the
Board of Executive Directors in June 2009. As of March 2009, the World Bank Group had a
total commitment of US$69.8 million (including an IDA commitment of US$12.4 million)
with 9 active projects in the health and education sectors, in agriculture, in support to youth
development, in planning and public financial management, and in the energy sector.
6.
As budget support is no longer required given the increase in petroleum revenue, the
CSP program was replaced by donor support for the Government’s National Priorities
Program launched in 2008. The annual program was continued in 2009 and included seven
priority areas: (i) agriculture and food security; (ii) rural development; (iii) human resources
development; (iv) social protection and social services; (v) public safety and security;
(vi) clean and effective Government; (vii) access to justice.
7.
The eighth and latest Timor-Leste Development Partners Meeting (TLDPM) took
place on April 2–4, 2009. The World Bank helped the preparation of the Government’s
background paper to the TLDPM.

7
ANNEX III. TIMOR-LESTE: RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
(As of May 26, 2009)
1.
Timor-Leste joined the Asian Development Bank (AsDB) on July 24, 2002. To date,
there has been no lending to the country. However, like other international financial
institutions and bilateral donors, the AsDB has been actively involved in the reconstruction
and development of the economy since late 1999.
2.
Prior to 2008 the AsDB’s involvement centered around co-managing with the World
Bank the Trust Fund for East Timor (TFET), which was established in December 1999 as a
vehicle to provide grant assistance for reconstruction activities and economic development in
Timor-Leste. 2 Under the TFET, AsDB managed six projects with total funding of
$51.7 million, 3 which aimed at the rehabilitation of physical infrastructure (urban and rural
power, national roads, ports, and water and sanitation) and the development of microfinance.
In the wake of the post-referendum destruction, the focus of the projects was on providing
emergency assistance, but subsequently shifted to meeting the country’s long-term
development needs.
3.
The AsDB’s Country Operations Business Plan for 2008 to 2010 identifies
infrastructure development and management as the primary focus of AsDB support to TimorLeste. An ongoing road rehabilitation project ($10 million grant) and Dili water supply
project ($6 million grant) are funded through the 9th Asian Development Fund (ADF IX). The
recently negotiated ADF X allocates approximately $20 million for the first biennial period
2009-2010, entirely on a grant basis. Most of this money will support road maintenance,
rehabilitation, and improvement. Additional AsDB technical assistance will average
approximately $2 million per annum. Allocations will be confirmed in a new Country
Partnership Strategy for 2009–2013. Timor-Leste is the recipient of AsDB’s largest ever
technical assistance (TA) grant, the Infrastructure Project Management TA. This $15 million
four-year package, co-financed with AusAID, finances international and domestic project
engineers, procurement specialists, and others to work within the Ministry of Infrastructure to
help plan, prepare, and execute the Government’s capital development program.

2

See footnote 1 in Annex II, Relations with the World Bank Group.

These projects comprise the Emergency Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project ($29.8 million); the Emergency
Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project 2 ($9 million); the Water Supply and Sanitation Rehabilitation Project
($4.5 million); the Water Supply and Sanitation Rehabilitation Project 2 ($4.5 million); the Hera Fisheries Port
Facilities Rehabilitation Project ($1 million); and the Microfinance Development Project (originally $4 million,
but reduced to $2.7 million).

8
4.
AsDB is currently preparing a new ADF-funded project in road network development
and a project on community based roads maintenance drawing on the Japan Fund for Poverty
Reduction. A regional private sector development support program, can also support access
to finance (micro-finance and secured transactions) and public-private-partnerships in
infrastructure development. AsDB has also intensified efforts to strengthen and divest the
Microfinance Institute of Timor-Leste (IMfTL). It is also designing a technical assistance
program in support of statistics and macro economic management.

9

ANNEX IV. TIMOR-LESTE: STATISTICAL ISSUES
As of June 30, 2009
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision to the Fund has serious shortcomings that significantly hamper
surveillance. Weaknesses remain in the macroeconomic data, especially the national
accounts. A multi-sector Fund statistics mission visited Dili in November 2000 and assisted
the authorities in establishing objectives for restoring economic statistics and in setting up a
Statistical Division in the Ministry of Planning and Finance in 2001. A long-term resident
statistical advisor assisted the Statistical Division during November 2001–February 2004,
and was succeeded by a new resident advisor until September 2005. Technical assistance in
balance of payments (peripatetic) and monetary statistics to the Banking and Payments
Authority (BPA) began in mid 2007 and January 2008, respectively, and will continue
through at least FY 2010.
National Accounts: Under a World Bank-financed project, national accounts data for 2000
(both sector and expenditure basis) were estimated by the Boston Institute for Developing
Economies (BIDE). In late 2004, BIDE, under a follow-up World Bank project, produced
GDP estimates for 2001-03 that suffer from limited source data and substantial extrapolation.
The Statistics Directorate has not been able to replicate the BIDE estimation exercise.
Consequently, estimates of GDP (including for the oil sector) have been prepared by Fund
staff in cooperation with the Macroeconomic Unit in the Ministry of Finance. To improve
national accounts data, appropriate staff and substantial efforts in data collection and
compilation are needed. Using World Bank funding and commencing in April 2009, the
authorities are employing a consultant to develop annual estimates of GDP.
Price statistics: A consumer price index has been compiled for Dili since December 2001
and for the whole country since June 2003. Prices for all items in the basket are collected on a
monthly basis in the Dili region. Elsewhere, prices are collected at quarterly intervals for a
representative selection of other regions throughout Timor-Leste. The measure of the interim
monthly price movements for each item outside the Dili region is then estimated using the
corresponding Dili region item price movement as an indicator series. To address quality
weaknesses, in particular inappropriate and outdated weights, the commodity basket and the
weighting scheme were revised in mid-2003 under a donor-supported project. A further
update of CPI weights based on detailed consumption patterns is expected to commence later
in 2009 using data derived from the Timor-Leste Living Standards Survey that was conducted
in 2006/7. An update of products and outlets is also needed.
Labor market statistics: Annual data on public sector employment and wages are available
in official budget documentation. No official data are compiled regularly on private sector
employment and wages, except for partial data from various household surveys conducted by
UNDP, ILO, ADB, and the World Bank.

10
Government finance statistics: Official data on central government revenue and
expenditure are published quarterly. Audited annual financial statements of the executed
budget are made available to APD as soon as they are released, normally three months after
the end of the fiscal year. In addition, monthly data are available on request through the
budget, treasury, and revenue services. The compilation of revenue and expenditure follows
the classification of the Manual on Government Finance Statistics (GFSM 1986) (including
expenditure based on both functional and economic classification). Only partial data are
available on fiscal and quasi-fiscal activities undertaken by bilateral donors outside the
central government budget. Currently, there are four non-financial public enterprises, which
are treated as government agencies and data on their operations are available in the audited
annual financial statements. No data are currently reported for the GFS Yearbook and the
International Financial Statistics.
Monetary statistics: Monetary statistics are compiled by the BPA, generally following the
methodology of the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual. However, data are incomplete
because of the absence of official data on public currency holdings—which are difficult to
compile under the current currency regime—and of banks’ positions with public nonfinancial
corporations. The BPA publishes current monetary data on its website on a regular monthly
basis and a quarterly bulletin and an annual report with key monetary aggregates.
Detailed monthly monetary data are now available from July 2002 onward following the
introduction of the standardized report forms (SRFs). Beginning in February 2008, monetary
data are reported to the IMF for publication in the International Financial Statistics. SRFbased data are used for the Fund’s operational and publication purposes. The BPA is planning
to introduce a new chart of accounts for the BPA in the coming months and a revised call
report form (CRF) in mid-2009 to obtain balance-sheet information from other depository
corporations (ODCs). A March 2009 mission assisted the authorities in finalizing the design
of the CRF and expanded the institutional coverage of the ODCs to include all microfinance
institutions. A follow-up mission has been tentatively scheduled during FY 2010 to assist the
authorities in introducing the SRFs for the central bank based on the new chart of accounts of
the BPA and for the ODCs based on the revised CRF and including the credit unions in the
institutional coverage of the ODCs.
Balance of payments: Monthly data on merchandise exports and imports have been
produced starting March 2000, based on customs reports with a breakdown for major
commodity categories. Data do not include oil and gas exports or an estimate of the large,
unrecorded border trade. The monthly trade data are now published regularly but there are
significant gaps in the series for 2006 and 2007. In the Fund staff estimates, data on oil/gas
revenue are currently recorded as current income based on fiscal data.
With technical assistance provided by the IMF’s Statistics Department, annual balance of
payments data for 2006 and 2007 were published by the BPA in December 2008. The 2008
estimates have not yet been finalized.
While methodology for the production of basic annual estimates of the balance of payments
statistics are in place, further development work is anticipated to address limitations of
existing data sources, in particular grants, merchandise trade statistics, and travel exports.

11
The coverage of the survey of foreign direct investment enterprises needs to be expanded, and
the exploration and extraction activities, in the Joint Petroleum Development Area and in the
exclusive territory, will require continuous coverage. As the economy grows, it will be
important to monitor new activities such as new direct investment. Currently, there is limited
information on remittances from Timorese working abroad and improvement in the
estimation/compilation procedures of such remittances should be pursued.
Some data on stocks of financial assets and liabilities have been collected as the balance of
payments development has taken place, and the annual international investment position
statements should be finalized. Development of quarterly statistics should also be pursued.

ANNEX V. POVERTY REDUCTION: THE ROLE OF INFRASTRUCTURE
Timor-Leste is one of the poorest countries in Asia. A 2001 household income and
expenditure study estimated that 36 percent of the population lived below the national
poverty line, almost all of whom were in rural areas with poor access to water, sanitation and
health care. A 2007 update suggests that many key dimensions of living standards have
improved, as shown by improved self-assessments of living standards, and in school
enrolment rates, immunization rates and the availability of many basic services. 5 However,
the share of the population living below the poverty line was found to have increased to about
50 percent. Half of the children less than five years were underweight in 2007, with
12 percent to 18 percent of children under five years severely underweight. Large gaps
remain in access to education and health care and other essential services and in the quality of
these services. Living standards are noticeably lower in rural areas, with about three quarters
of the poor living in rural areas.
Shortcomings in infrastructure appear to be central to the poverty problem. They make it
more difficult for the poor to access markets for their products and essential services and add
to the cost of goods and services needed by the poor. The poor are also more likely to face the
shortcomings in infrastructure. For example, at the national level, 64 percent of the poor have
access to all weather roads, compared with 76 percent of the non-poor. And in rural areas the
proportion of poor with access to all weather roads decreases further to 58 percent compared
with 68 percent of the non-poor.
Much of Timor-Leste’s infrastructure was badly damaged immediately following the
referendum in 1999, either during the violence that ensued or subsequently because of the
damage from heavy vehicles, lack of maintenance or heavy rain. Despite efforts at
rehabilitation, critical infrastructure has deteriorated further since then. This is particularly
the case for the road network.
Road is the primary mode of transport, carrying 70 percent of freight and 90 percent of
passengers. Timor-Leste has an extensive road network of about 6,000 km, half of which are
currently undeveloped rural tracks. The core network comprises 1,400 km of national roads
connecting the 13 districts and 900 km of district roads linking major population centers to
the national roads. About 80 percent (or 1,800 km) of core roads are, or used to be paved.
Almost the whole core road network needs rehabilitation works to restore the network to a
maintainable condition as road conditions demonstrate premature deterioration due to lack of
routine and preventive maintenance. This is compounded by intense rainfalls and unstable
geotechnical conditions in mountainous areas causing frequent landslides.
5

Timor-Leste Ministry of Finance, and World Bank. 2008. Timor-Leste: Poverty in a Young Nation. Dili.

14

According to a recent Asian Development Bank road condition survey, almost the whole core
road network has deteriorated into conditions that are no longer maintainable; about
22 percent of the core roads are in poor condition and about 70 percent in very poor
condition. The needs of annual maintenance expenditure for the whole core road network are
estimated in the order of $20–30 million under current road conditions.
Power and water supply and sanitation infrastructure are also degraded. Access to regular
power supply in urban areas has deteriorated, and access to clean water remains problematic
in both urban and rural areas. There are three contributing factors: the poor and deteriorating
nature of existing physical infrastructure; cost and logistical issues in accessing rural areas;
and weak public sector capacity in terms of infrastructure planning, management and
prioritization.

15
ANNEX VI. PROSPECTS FOR FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT:
THE EMERGING ROLE OF MICRO-FINANCE
While there is a high level of excess liquidity in the financial system, the commercial banks
have become reluctant to lend to local businesses. Foreign banks cannot own land and need
to rely on land leases or other assets as security. But uncertainty over the legitimacy of land
titles and the nascent state of the system of land leases make it difficult for land to be used as
collateral. Use of other assets as collateral is hindered by the absence of a local insurance
industry. The still developing civil court system is slow as it is heavily overworked, adding to
uncertainty in the ability to access security in the event of loan default. These difficulties
contributed to the quick emergence of a non-performing loan problem following a surge in
domestic credit.
Microfinance has a narrow coverage, but is showing it can find ways of working within the
heavily constrained environment. The largest microfinance institution, Instituição de Micro
Finanças de Timor-Leste (IMfTL) has operated since 2002. It has built itself on loans secured
by public sector salaries. Many loans were for housing and other household needs, but loans
were also used within extended families to start small-scale business enterprises, such as
small trading and taxi operations. A $1 million ceiling on deposits under the Banking and
Payments Authority (BPA) Act delayed expansion plans (IMfTL is the only microfinance
institution regulated by the BPA). The ceiling was lifted to $3 million after the government
took sole ownership of, and recapitalized, IMfTL in December 2008.
Deposits with IMfTL, from around 23,000 depositors, had reached $1.4 million by March
2009. Total loans of $4.0 million as of March 2009 were well above the $2.3 million of
December 2007. Seven district offices are now established and offices are planned for all
districts by 2011. Salary loans still account for 75 percent of total loans, but alternative
products⎯i.e., micro finance group loans, market vendor loans, agriculture loans and micro
enterprises loans⎯are rising. The salary-backing of most loans and careful lending practices
are credited with a low overall provision for non-performing of only 2.2 percent of the total
value of loans.
Other key microfinance institutions are Moris Rasik and Tuba Rei Martin. Moris Rasik is the
leading microfinance institution for poverty reduction. It operates solely in rural areas and
lends only to women, along the lines of the well-known Grameen Bank approach. Total loans
were $2.2 million as of December 2007 and deposits from 11,500 accounts totaled
$0.8 million. Tuba Rei Martin held around $0.4 million in deposits from almost
3,000 accounts as of July 2008, with loans of $0.4 million. Credit unions, which have a longstanding presence in Timor-Leste, are also active, as are pawn shops, money lenders and a
number of small donor-funded loan facilities.

16
A recent assessment concluded there is considerable unmet demand for microfinance. 6 The
shortfall was estimated to be as much as 80,000 micro-credit loans worth more than
US$50 million. Lack of credit is a particularly important constraint to agriculture, which
accounts for about 80 percent of employment. Agribusiness is hindered because loans are
generally unavailable for the purchase of farm inputs or improvements, or for trade in farm
products. Micro-savings services are also under-supplied.
Interest rates are high. IMfTL for example lends at 16 percent to 18 percent per annum and
rates at Tuba Rei Martin are up to 70 percent per annum. The high interest rates primarily
reflect the high cost of providing a large number of small transactions. In an effort to lower
interest costs, the Inclusive Finance for the Under-Served Economy (or INFUSE) project has
been proposed as source of low cost wholesale funds (and technical support). However, care
is needed to ensure that this inflow of foreign funds does not impede deposit taking.
There are long standing proposals for a government-owned national development bank. Key
issues to be faced by such a bank would be: the potential to displace rather than supplement
existing financial operations; the potential fiscal downside of carrying too much risk in an
effort to kick-start development; and whether it is desirable for governments to own financial
institutions. An alternative approach could be to provide support through new, targeted
programs implemented through existing institutions. An emphasis on helping potential
borrowers develop and then implement good loan projects rather than just providing cheap
loans is likely to offer the highest development impact.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2009 Article IV Consultation with the
Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste
On July 22, 2009, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste. 1
Background
The Timorese economy has posted high economic growth over the past two years, driven by
rapid increases in government spending and a recovery in agriculture from a 2007 drought, and
underpinned by improved security conditions. Non-oil real GDP growth reached almost
13 percent in 2008. However, private investment remains small, and Timor-Leste is still among
the least developed countries in the world. The global crisis has had little immediate impact on
Timor-Leste, as key transmission channels (trade, investment and finance) remain limited. The
key adverse impact has been through lower oil prices, which if persistent would reduce the
sustainable level of public spending. Inflation peaked at over 10 percent year-on-year in mid2008, but has since declined significantly, along with international food prices. The real
exchange rate appreciated, reflecting a weakening of the Indonesian and Australian currencies
vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar, and helped reduce inflationary pressures.
Central government spending rose sharply in 2008, reflecting efforts to address pressing
development needs and secure social cohesion. Increases in capital spending, current
transfers, and rice subsidies were particularly large. However, petroleum revenue soared on
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

the back of high oil/gas prices and an increase in production volumes, leading to an expansion
of the fiscal and external surpluses.
The commercial banking sector, consisting of three foreign bank branches, remains very small,
and has not been adversely affected by the global financial crisis. Credit has remained
stagnant, hampered by a high share of non-performing loans and the lack of effective contract
enforcement. Only a small, state-owned microfinance institution has experienced significant
credit growth.
The near-term outlook is still positive, with real non-oil GDP growth expected to moderate
somewhat but remain at high levels. However, oil prices are expected to remain below their
2008 average, prompting a sharp decline in the fiscal and external surpluses. The medium-term
outlook is highly uncertain. Key but hard-to-predict determinants include the path of oil and gas
revenue, security conditions, the magnitude and quality of public spending, and progress on
reforms to improve the business climate.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed Timor-Leste’s strong economic growth over the last two years,
supported by public spending and improved security, and noted that the global crisis has not
had a major impact on the economy given the limited external linkages. Going forward, the key
challenge remains to use oil and gas revenue to develop a sustainable non-oil economy and
alleviate poverty, while maintaining macroeconomic stability.
Directors welcomed the recently announced moderation in government spending and
recommended that expenditure be brought in line with sustainable income as soon as existing
commitments allow. They looked forward to the forthcoming Strategic Development Plan, which
should provide guidance for a medium-term budget framework aimed at ensuring fiscal
sustainability, improving the quality of government spending and public financial management,
and strengthening transparency and controls. Directors noted that spending should be carefully
prioritized so as to create room for essential infrastructure, health and education expenditure,
and better-targeted poverty-reducing transfers. They saw scope to enhance fiscal revenue by
improving tax administration, broadening the tax base, and charging appropriate tariffs for
utilities, including electricity.
Directors believed that the Petroleum Fund should remain the cornerstone of the country’s
public financial management. By insulating the budget from petroleum revenue volatility and
setting high standards for transparency, they viewed the Petroleum Fund as safeguarding fiscal
sustainability and promoting macroeconomic stability. Directors supported a prudent approach
toward widening the fund’s investment portfolio. They recommended that any foreign borrowing
be subject to parliamentary approval and proper justification, be on concessional terms, and
deliver a net positive rate of return.
Directors noted that official dollarization has served the country well and has provided a strong
nominal anchor for inflation expectations. They observed that fiscal policy needs to be
consistent with the exchange rate regime to ensure external sustainability and reduce pressures

3
on the real exchange rate. To boost competitiveness, productivity should be enhanced and
business climate reforms introduced. Directors recommended passage of the pending land law,
strengthening of contract enforcement through judicial reform and adoption of alternative
dispute resolution mechanisms, and introduction of eased business regulation, including by
simplifying registration and licensing procedures.
While banks have not been adversely affected by the global financial turmoil, Directors
welcomed continued efforts to strengthen financial sector supervision and promote financial
development. They noted that clearly defined property rights and contract enforcement are
needed for financial deepening. Directors underlined the importance of strengthening
cooperation with home supervisors of foreign banks and passing legislation to safeguard the
Banking and Payment Authority’s autonomy.
Directors commended the progress made on the compilation of financial and balance of
payments statistics. They encouraged improved monitoring of real sector activity through annual
surveys and the compilation of national accounts.

Statement by Arrigo Sadun, Executive Director for the
Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste, and
José Cardoso, Advisor to Executive Director
July 22, 2009

On behalf of the Timorese authorities, we thank staff for the insightful 2009 Article IV and
Selected Issues reports, and for the constructive dialog. The authorities regret the Fund’s
decision of terminating the position of Resident Representative in Timor-Leste (closed in the
end of June). We would like to express the authorities’ appreciation for the competence and
personal engagement of the Fund’s Resident Representative, and to wish him success in his
new tasks at the Fund. The Fund’s technical assistance is extremely valuable in Timor-Leste
and the authorities expect, under the new circumstances, a deeper engagement of the Fund
given the extremely challenging endeavors that Timor-Leste faces ahead.

1. Introduction
Since the last Article IV consultation one year ago, food security and social cohesion
have improved notably, and these short-term priorities were successfully accomplished.
“What a difference one year makes”, could be the phrase that best characterizes the recent
evolution in Timor-Leste. However, the underlying fragility of this post-conflict country
remains latent pending the consolidation of these achievements, given the fact that food
security is a continuously moving target (although its most severe impact is already over with
the end of the food price crisis), and social cohesion is very much dependent upon the
development of a sustainable non-oil economy and the reduction of unemployment
(especially among the urban youth).
Considering the past adverse circumstances, the low ranking of Timor-Leste in terms of
competitiveness is understandable, even by the standards of other low-income countries.
However, the authorities’ successful achievement of stability has created the social
foundations for non-oil development, which is constrained however by the still inexistent
economic pillars of a land law (in order to facilitate bank lending and private investment) and
basic infrastructures — a necessary condition to raise the development of non-oil economic
activities. Therefore, the focus of the authorities is now centered on the development of an
ambitious program of infrastructure projects, and 2009 has been nationally declared the
“Year of Infrastructure”. Public investment in infrastructure has shown to be, in all countries
in the world, an important engine for growth and employment creation. It comprises a very
expensive public intervention, but one that is known to be profitable for future generations.

2. Economic overview
2.1 Impact of the fuel and food crisis, and of the global economic crisis
The impact of last year’s fuel and food crisis was very significant in Timor-Leste. As an oil
exporting country, the oil price hike recorded last summer — along with an increase in
production volumes and in earnings from the Petroleum Fund — boosted the central
government’s petroleum revenue. However, at the same time, Timor-Leste is one of the least
developed countries in the world and, excluding the Petroleum Fund, is also one of the
poorest countries in the world. Given the fact that the Timorese people spend a very large
share of their income (about 60 percent) on food items, the food price hike prompted the
government to prevent the threat of famine and to provide food security by importing large
quantities of rice for subsidized resale, which in turn constituted a heavy burden to the
budget. With the drop in fuel and food prices from last summer’s peak, these effects have
reversed and, consequently, have reduced both the burden to the budget of the government’s
intervention and also the central government’s petroleum revenue.
The direct impact of the current global economic crisis has been limited in Timor-Leste.
With foreign investment and non-oil exports still at very low levels, and with a financial
sector at an embryonic stage, the key channels through which the crisis has spread across the
globe — trade, investment, and financial products — have played little or no role in TimorLeste’s economy. As for the banking sector, the foreign parent banks of the three commercial
branches operating in Timor-Leste present a strong financial position, with two of them in
the Global Finance ranking of the world’s 50 safest banks.
At present, Timor-Leste faces a financing challenge of how to cope with the country’s
pressing development bottlenecks and poverty reduction needs. The current juncture of lower
oil prices, if it persists, could reduce the estimated sustainable income and, consequently, the
budgetary petroleum revenue (which accounts for about 97 percent of all budgetary revenue).
Therefore, the authorities have considered, and will further consider, all possible financing
options, taking into consideration, as in the past, the country’s absorptive capacity constraints
and the goal of price stability.
2.2 Government’s current financing strategy
Until now, the country has relied on its own resources and avoided embarking on an
external borrowing strategy. The Petroleum Fund Law allows drawings to exceed the
estimated sustainable income, if necessary and justifiable as being in the long-term interest of
the country, under approval by the parliament, through a highly responsible and transparent
process. To finance and fully implement the ambitious program of the 2009 Budget, the
government requested parliamentary approval to withdraw up to $589.8 million from the
Petroleum Fund ($181.2 million in excess of the estimated sustainable income). The request
complied with all the legal requirements defined in the Petroleum Fund Law. The parliament
recognized the request as being in the long-term interest of the country — and therefore
profitable for future generations — and approved it. The authorities remain committed to the
principles of fiscal sustainability and inter-generational equity.

3
2.3 Macroeconomic outlook: results in 2008 and projections for 2009
Under the above explained circumstances and financing framework, the authorities were able
to deliver a significant improvement in the execution rates of capital expenditure, and to
effectively implement long-standing difficult measures. Additionally, we also highlight the
fact that so far the Government has not drawn resources from the Petroleum Fund for
budget support in excess of the estimated sustainable income.
The real non-oil GDP growth rate recorded a consecutive new high in 2008, reaching almost
13 percent. The main driving forces were the significant improvement of security conditions,
the rebound in agriculture from the 2007 drought, and the substantial increase in public
spending. Official dollarization has served the country well and has helped contain
inflationary expectations. Additionally, the appreciation of the US dollar vis-à-vis the
Indonesian and Australian currencies has led to a real exchange rate appreciation, which
further contributed to abate inflationary pressures. Therefore, after last year’s inflation peak
due to the food crisis (food represents 60 percent in the CPI), inflation abated to less than 4
percent (year-on-year) in June, and is expected to remain at low levels.
Regarding the fiscal position, the central government’s surplus peaked at its highest level
ever, reaching 384 percent of non-oil GDP in 2008. The central government’s petroleum
revenue almost doubled in 2008 to $2.4 billion (close to 5 times non-oil GDP). This outcome
reflected the surge in international oil prices in the first half of 2008 and, to a lesser extent,
the 15 percent increase in production volumes and the doubling in earnings from the
Petroleum Fund. For 2009, the significantly lower oil prices will be felt. Timor-Leste is
expected to continue recording comfortable surpluses, although not as high as last year.
Regarding capital expenditures, the successful improvement in its execution rates should
not be confused with any lesser commitment to fiscal soundness from the authorities, but
with the authorities’ strong determination in implementing the necessary measures. The
same reasons explain the evolution in the external position. In 2008, the current account
surplus also peaked, recording a figure four times non-oil GDP, but for 2009 the surplus is
expected to be far below this level, although still at a comfortable level close to two times
non-oil GDP.
2.4 Macroeconomic guidelines for 2010
For 2010, the authorities have set a fiscal envelope — a document whose purpose is to guide
the preparation of the 2010 Budget — that will restrain fiscal expenditure for 2010 below the
level budgeted for 2009. The fiscal envelope — agreed by the ministries for each Organ of
State — specifies the maximum amount of funding each Organ of State may receive in 2010.
It entails significant cuts in appropriations for goods and services (30 percent) and minor
capital (65 percent) relative to the 2009 Budget, while allowing for an increase in capital
investment. Wages and salaries will be maintained at the levels of the 2009 Budget.
Therefore, the fiscal envelope will force an effective prioritization of all existing activities
and proposed new activities under the authorities’ national priorities. We note from the
staff’s report that the 2010 fiscal envelope is consistent with the staff’s “strong policy”
scenario.

3. Poverty reduction and structural reforms
3.1 Poverty reduction, and economic and legislative reforms
Between 2001 and 2007, the percentage of Timorese people living in poverty increased from
36.3 to 49.9 percent of the overall population, thus increasing the number of poor people to
half a million. From this number, about half are children suffering from malnutrition and
from being underweight. Under such a reality, it was necessary to implement decisive
measures to prevent famine and assure food security. Additionally, pacification measures
were implemented, which finally created the conditions for social cohesion. These social
measures involved financial support to (i) veterans, elderly, and those disabled, (ii) the return
of some 100,000 internally displaced persons (IDP’s) to their homes, and (iii) the
reintegration of some 800 petitioners from the 2006 rebellion into military and civilian life.
All these measures represented a significant burden to the budget, and constituted a necessary
step to reduce poverty and create the fundamental conditions for the development of non-oil
activities. However, the country still lacks basic infrastructure and a land law.
The establishment of a land law is never an easy task and, in the case of Timor-Leste, it is
even more complicated given the rooted mindsets of ancient practices. On top of it, TimorLeste had three decades in almost permanent conflict. Being a post-conflict country, there is
the risk that an inadequate land law may not only compromise poverty reduction, but also
trigger consequences far beyond its failure, and once again ignite social tensions that could
undermine the recently achieved social cohesion. Therefore, for the land law to be successful,
it will be necessary to build a strong national consensus around the substance of the law.
Under these guidelines, the authorities decided to start a public consultation process on the
Draft Law to Establish the Special Regime for Attributing Property Rights (Draft Land Law).
The goal is to consult the Timorese people about the Draft Land Law, and to sound the public
opinion before the Draft is sent to the council of ministers and then to the parliament later
this year. During the public consultation, the civil society will have the opportunity to
comment on this Draft, which sets out the proposal for establishing a special legal regime
that will allow the government to determine and award first-time property ownership rights
to land in Timor-Leste. The public consultation was launched in June and will continue
through August, reaching the entire country.
The land law will have a significant impact at all levels, but there are other important
reforms to undertake, such as strengthening banking sector regulation and supervision, and
developing an insurance sector. The authorities are also considering ways to reduce the cost
of credit, either directly or in cooperation with private financial institutions. Finally,
significant steps to improve the business environment have recently been taken, like the
one-stop-shop for investors, but important measures are still necessary in the judicial area.
The authorities have paid great attention to organizational reforms, such as the
decentralization of fiscal operations, which has given the ministries greater autonomy and
accountability. As a result, domestic tax revenue has increased along with an expanded base
(despite the tax rate cuts implemented in mid-2008 with the tax reform), and the execution
rates of the capital budget improved significantly. At the same time, the authorities have
further strengthened transparency by completing the move to a cash-based budget system,
eliminating the practice of carry-overs, and developing a medium-term fiscal framework.

5
3.2 Investment strategy of the Petroleum Fund
The Petroleum Fund of Timor-Leste has been one of the world’s best performing sovereign
wealth funds over the past year. However, while investing in US government bonds proved
to be a good investment last year, it is now appropriate to diversify the investment portfolio.
Accordingly, in June the Timorese authorities appointed the Bank for International
Settlements (BIS) as the Petroleum Fund’s first external manager. The BIS will be
responsible for the management of $1 billion of Petroleum Fund resources. With this
arrangement, the Petroleum Fund will also be invested in longer-term US Treasury Notes as
well as bonds issued by other foreign governments. The appointment of the BIS as the
Petroleum Fund’s first external manager is the initial step in the government’s aim to
diversify the investment portfolio of the Petroleum Fund in order to increase its expected
return and better diversify risks.
The appointment of the BIS as the Petroleum Fund’s first external manager respects the
Petroleum Fund Law and all the transparency requirements that characterize the Petroleum
Fund. Additionally, according to the Petroleum Fund Law, in 2010 (five years after the
establishment of the Petroleum Fund) the authorities should undertake a deep review of the
Petroleum Fund’s investment strategy. By then, the authorities will consider an even more
diversified investment strategy while maintaining the basic principles of Petroleum Fund
management.
3.3 Government’s potential alternative financing strategy
As an alternative or a complement to the use of supplemental resources from the
Petroleum Fund, a strategy of foreign borrowing could be considered. The authorities
recognize that the impact on the country’s net wealth could be the same between foreign
borrowing and drawing resources from the Petroleum Fund. Foreign borrowing could be
even more favorable if based on concessional terms. Additionally, if technical assistance is
attached, foreign borrowing could also assist implementation of major infrastructure projects.
If the authorities opt for foreign borrowing, they will pay close attention to its sustainability
and will ensure that such borrowing (i) is adequately concessional, (ii) delivers a net positive
rate of return by taking into account all costs (including non-interest costs), and (iii) is
consistent with macroeconomic stability. Timor-Leste does not yet have the necessary
management capacity to implement a foreign borrowing strategy. Therefore, technical
assistance would be necessary to start this financing strategy.

4. Final remarks
The latest achievements have created the basic social conditions for the development of nonoil activities. However, the underlying fragility of this post-conflict country remains highly
visible in very worrisome levels of poverty. The authorities are determined to continue the
implementation of a very ambitious reform agenda in order to develop the country and profit
both the current and future generations, and they invite the international community’s
involvement in the current momentum.
