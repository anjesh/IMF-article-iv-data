STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
Outlook and Risks: India’s near-term growth outlook has improved and the balance of
risks is now more favorable, helped by increased political certainty, several policy actions,
improved business confidence, lower commodity import prices, and reduced external
vulnerabilities. Nonetheless, high inflation expectations and wide fiscal deficits remain key
macroeconomic challenges, resulting in limited policy space to adopt countercyclical policies.
Supply-side bottlenecks and structural challenges—particularly in the agriculture, mining
and power sectors—constrain medium-term growth and hinder job creation. Risks are still
tilted to the downside, with the main external risk stemming from surges in global financial
market volatility. On the domestic side, a further weakening of bank and corporate balance
sheets could pose risks to economic recovery and weigh on financial soundness. Sustained
low global energy prices constitutes an upside risk to growth and downside risk to inflation,
and would help contain both external and fiscal imbalances.
Key Policy Recommendations:


Despite recent moderation in headline inflation, underlying inflationary pressures
and upside risks remain. Monetary policy should remain tight to reduce inflation and
inflation expectations durably.



Fiscal consolidation should continue. The quality of the consolidation should be
improved, underpinned by comprehensive tax reform (such as introducing the goods
and services tax and improving tax administration) and measures to further reduce
subsidies.



To safeguard financial stability in the presence of rising corporate and banking
sector strains, regulation should be further enhanced, provisioning increased,
monitoring of corporate vulnerabilities strengthened (especially in light of large
unhedged FX exposures), and debt recovery by banks further encouraged.



Should external pressures from global financial market volatility resurface, rupee
flexibility is an important shock absorber, complemented by tightening of the
monetary stance, with foreign exchange intervention limited to preventing excessive
volatility.



While several policy actions have been taken recently, further steps in relaxing longstanding supply bottlenecks, especially in energy, mining and power sectors, as well
as labor market reforms, are crucial to achieving faster and more inclusive growth.

The decisive outcome of the national elections has buoyed sentiment and boosted
expectations of economic reforms. The Bharatiya Janata Party scored a landslide victory in India’s
parliamentary elections in May 2014. The new government has initiated economic reforms, including diesel
price deregulation and raising natural gas prices, taken steps towards more flexible labor markets,
commenced reforms in the coal sector, and is enhancing financial inclusion (see Text Table 1 on policy
reforms undertaken in fiscal year 2014/15). Nonetheless, much remains to be done to raise potential
growth, particularly in areas of reforming factor and product markets, many of which are on the concurrent
list (areas where the central government and states can legislate), and thus will require consensus building
to implement. Some states have initiated reforms on the concurrent list, such as labor market reforms, and
have requested presidential assent, a modality that could enable states to reform at a faster pace.

The recovery is strengthening gradually. Real GDP growth had slowed sharply to around
4½ percent in 2012/13 and 2013/14, as a result of growing imbalances, binding supply constraints, and
subdued sentiment. However, as vulnerabilities

procurement prices, the release of food grain stocks,
lower oil prices, and favorable base effects. India’s
improved near-term growth prospects and lower external vulnerabilities have led to sizable capital inflows,
appreciation of the rupee, and a rise in equity prices to record highs.
4.
Past Fund advice and the authorities’ macroeconomic policies have been broadly aligned,
but progress on structural reforms has been partial. The fiscal deficit target set by the authorities was
met in 2013/14, which staff had endorsed, and staff also supports the authorities’ intentions regarding the
pace of medium-term consolidation. Diesel prices were deregulated and LPG subsidies were capped,
leading to a lower fuel subsidy bill. The stance of monetary policy was tightened in 2013/14 to reduce
inflation, consistent with Fund advice. The RBI has moved to make the containment of inflation its primary
objective, with headline CPI inflation now the principal nominal anchor for monetary policy. Almost all key
recommendations of the 2012 FSAP Update have been implemented (Text Table 2). Progress on product
and labor market reforms has been limited, though some labor market reforms have been initiated by the
center and a few states.

recovery as projects are implemented. Real GDP growth (at factor cost) is forecast to rise to
5½ percent in 2014/15 (up from 4¾ percent achieved in 2013/14), further accelerating to
6¼ percent in 2015/16, as a result of the revival in industrial and investment activity. In the presence
of supply-side bottlenecks and structural challenges, and assuming no substantial legislative changes,
medium term growth is projected to remain at around 6¾ percent, considerably below the 8 percent
average achieved during 2002–07 (see Box 1 on potential growth).

trade should help contain the deficit. As domestic
inflation has moderated and international gold prices
have fallen, import demand for gold is not expected to
return to 2013/14 levels, and should not lead to a large
widening of the CAD even with the government’s recent
withdrawal of various administrative measures.

7.
The current account deficit (CAD) has narrowed
considerably and is expected to remain contained and
comfortably financed. Around half of the 3 percentage
points of GDP decline in the CAD in 2013/14 was
attributable to the fall in gold imports, owing to higher
import duties and administrative measures, with weak
domestic demand and revival in exports also contributing
to the narrowing deficit. The CAD is expected to remain at
around 1¾ percent of GDP in 2014/15 (helped by
significantly lower oil import prices), widening to about
2½ percent of GDP over the medium term as domestic
demand strengthens. Sustained lower global oil prices

headwinds to growth. Private banks (holding about one-quarter of banking system assets) are wellcapitalized, profitable, have low NPLs and limited exposure to troubled sectors, and thus will be able
to continue to contribute to credit expansion. However, problems are concentrated in public banks,
where asset quality and capital adequacy positions are at a lower level than in private sector banks.
Given diminished profitability, in order to maintain current capital adequacy ratios (CAR), public
banks will need to improve their capital base to extend sufficient credit to support growth.3 Any
further deterioration in asset quality could thereby constrain banks’ credit supply. Nonetheless,
reflecting buoyant investor sentiment, capital markets (corporate bonds and equities) should be able
to help contribute to financing growth.
9.
Notwithstanding recent improvements, downside economic risks remain (Annex I). On
the external side, despite the reduction in imbalances and strengthening of buffers, the spillover
impact from global financial market volatility to India could be very disruptive, including from any
unexpected developments in the course of U.S. monetary policy normalization, particularly against
the backdrop of recent large capital inflows (see Selected Issues Chapter I). Risks also emanate from
a prolonged period of weak global growth, which could dampen Indian exports. Domestic risks
include a supply-driven spike in inflation (possibly leading to higher gold imports), increased
weaknesses in corporate financial positions, including from significant unhedged foreign exchange
exposures (see Box 2) and further deterioration of bank asset quality, as well as slower-thanexpected progress in addressing supply-side bottlenecks, which could weigh on growth and stoke
inflation. On the upside, expedited structural reforms and faster implementation of cleared
investment projects could lead to stronger growth, as would sustained low global energy prices.
Authorities’ Views
10.
There was broad alignment in the macroeconomic projections of staff and the
authorities. The authorities project growth at about 5½ percent in the current fiscal year, given the
better-than-expected monsoon and favorable services sector output, and at slightly over 6 percent in
2015/16, owing to a pickup in global demand, the recovery of mining, and stronger investment. CPI
inflation is projected by the authorities to decline somewhat faster than the RBI’s glide path to
attaining the 6 percent objective by January 2016, reflecting their implementation of comprehensive
structural measures to tackle food inflation. They considered that India’s CAD should remain
contained in the neighborhood of 2 percent of GDP, as gold imports are not expected to revert to
previous highs, reflecting stronger fundamentals.
11.
The authorities believe they are well prepared for a reprise of global financial market
volatility, should it materialize. Fundamentals are stronger, reserves are higher, and markets seem
to be distinguishing India from other major EM economies. They recognize risks to the outlook,
including lower global growth as well as higher oil prices stemming from geopolitical events.
However, they also note that unhedged foreign exchange exposure of corporates—which have
3

Staff analysis indicates that to finance credit growth in the range of 15–20 percent to support the recovery and
maintain CAR at about 11 percent at public sector banks, capital injection of 0.1–0.2 percent of GDP will be required in
the near term, in addition to the amount allocated in the 2014/15 Union Budget.

increased during 2014—may not be the major vulnerability some had feared. They perceived the
external volatility of 2013 as having acted as a natural experiment, revealing greater resilience by
corporate India than previously believed. They agreed with staff that rupee exchange rate flexibility is
an important policy tool that helps contain external risks, and noted that they had enhanced the
RBI’s stock of international reserves for precautionary purposes.

POLICIES: NURTURING THE RECOVERY WHILE
MAINTAINING MACROECONOMIC STABILITY
To secure the recovery and maintain macroeconomic stability, staff recommends a comprehensive mediumterm policy framework (including measures in the monetary, fiscal, financial and structural areas) that
would raise actual and potential growth, increase policy space, and limit vulnerabilities.

A. Combating Inflation and Strengthening the Monetary Policy Framework
12.
Since September 2013, to tackle persistently-high inflation, the RBI raised the policy
repo rate, tightened liquidity, and took steps to enhance monetary transmission. The repo rate
was raised to combat inflation and maintain market stability, and has been kept on hold at 8 percent
between January 2014 and January 2015, supported by open market operations to sterilize FX
intervention. The RBI also took steps to enhance monetary transmission by lowering the cap on bank
access to its overnight liquidity adjustment facility (LAF), shifting liquidity injection toward term repos, and
paring back sector-specific liquidity facilities4. More recently, the RBI reduced the policy repo rate by 25
basis points (January 2015), reflecting disinflationary impulses.

Monetary policy needs to remain tight to reduce inflation and inflation expectations on
a durable basis. High inflation has been a key source of vulnerability, discouraging financial saving,
eroding external competitiveness and exacerbating external imbalances, as well as spurring inequality

The recalibration of the liquidity facilities, while primarily aimed at reducing banks’ passive dependence on the RBI for cash
and treasury management to enhance monetary transmission, has resulted in an effective further slight tightening of the
monetary stance by raising the average cost of central bank liquidity to above the repo rate.

inflation over the medium term to 4 percent, if that is
the objective ultimately adopted by the authorities, a
tight monetary policy stance will need to be accompanied by further structural reforms, which will boost
potential output and increase food production (see Selected Issues Chapter II).

14.
Continued progress is needed to further strengthen the monetary policy framework
and move towards flexible inflation targeting. The RBI has shifted policy formulation to focus on
containing inflation (with headline CPI inflation as a de-facto nominal anchor) and strengthened policy
communication, including through publication of two-year-ahead inflation forecasts and associated
confidence bands. Staff views the medium-term 4 percent inflation target set out by the Patel
Committee report as broadly appropriate. However, in view of India’s large weight on food in its CPI
basket and structurally-high food inflation, achieving this target will require ramping up food supply
commensurate with strong consumption demand. The associated band (+/- 2 percent) is appropriate
in light of India’s susceptibility to food supply and external shocks (see Selected Issues Chapter III).
Staff supports further efforts to enhance the monetary framework along the lines set out in the Patel

Committee Report including: increasing the operational autonomy of the RBI; institutionalization and
setting the target zone for headline CPI inflation; and establishment of a Monetary Policy Committee
and accountability framework (see Selected Issues Chapter IV).
Authorities’ Views
15.
The authorities noted that monetary policy needs to strike a balance between the
primary objective of reducing inflation and limiting the adverse impact on growth, while
preserving financial stability. The RBI recognized the effectiveness of supply-side measures to help
contain inflation, and noted that going forward, implementation of growth-friendly fiscal
consolidation and additional supply-side measures would constitute pre-conditions for monetary
easing. They also noted that upside risks to inflation remain, including from spikes in oil prices, price
pressures from input costs, deficient rainfall, as well as from ongoing excess demand for protein-rich
food items.
16.
The authorities emphasized that India has not yet adopted a flexible inflation targeting
regime. They consider the current regime to be a transitional one, and noted that discussions are
on-going between the RBI and the government on the final contours of the new monetary policy
framework, as indicated by the Finance Minister in the Budget speech on the need for a stronger
monetary policy framework. In the meantime, the RBI has indicated a CPI inflation “glide path” to the
achievement of a medium-term target for CPI inflation of 4 percent (+/- 2 percentage points).

B. Consolidating the Fiscal Position
17.
Fiscal consolidation has continued, in line with the government’s deficit reduction path.
The authorities have demonstrated their commitment to consolidation, in particular in light of the
negative output gap, leading to pro-cyclical fiscal tightening to restore fiscal space. The 2013/14
fiscal deficit of 4.5 percent of GDP (authorities’ definition) over-performed relative to the
government’s target of 4.7 percent of GDP, and the primary deficit has narrowed by 2 percentage
points of GDP since 2010/11. However, this consolidation was achieved largely as a result of cuts in
capital spending. The 2014/15 Budget targets a central government deficit of 4.1 percent of GDP
(authorities’ definition, equivalent to about 4½ percent of GDP in IMF terms). Despite sluggish
revenues and delayed disinvestment, this year’s deficit target is expected to be achieved in part due
to further expenditure compression. Nonetheless, declining global oil prices, in conjunction with the
recent diesel-price deregulation and capping of LPG subsidies, are expected to help lower the fuel
subsidy bill. To help meet the 2014/15 deficit target, energy excise duties were increased and nonplan expenditure was restrained.
18.
Looking forward, medium-term fiscal targets appear to be challenging. The mediumterm consolidation path aims for the central government deficit to narrow further to 3 percent of
GDP by 2016/17, but detailed measures underpinning this path have not yet been articulated.8
Achieving the 3 percent target for 2016/17 will require a comprehensive set of measures.
8

As a result, staff’s medium-term fiscal projections, which are on the basis of current policies and assume no major
legislative changes, forecast less fiscal adjustment.

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

INDIA

Overhauling the subsidy regime to contain leakages in food subsidies and further reducing
petroleum and fertilizer subsidies is estimated to yield around ½ of one percent of GDP in fiscal
savings. Given the narrowness of current Indian tax bases, further revenue gains can be achieved by
instituting tax administration reforms, including by reorganizing tax administration along functional
lines, by merging indirect and direct tax boards. Such measures on the revenue and expenditure side
should be undertaken, in order to increase growth-enhancing capital spending, while continuing on
an overall fiscal consolidation path.
19.
While the authorities’ commitment to fiscal consolidation is welcome, the quality of
consolidation should be improved to be more growth enhancing. Significant tax reforms and
further rationalization of subsidies will be required to create the fiscal space for higher growthenhancing capital spending and social expenditures. Specifically, staff recommends the following
measures:

namely direct benefit transfers, increased financial

The forthcoming recommendations of the Expenditure Management Commission should also be
helpful in identifying additional savings.

improve tax administration, including along the lines
outlined in the Tax Administration Reform Commission (TARC) reports, should continue.

9

The Food Security Act (2013)—which will provide subsidized rice, wheat and coarse cereals to 67 percent of the
Indian population—is not expected to add significantly to the 2014/15 fiscal subsidy burden, as it has been
implemented in only eleven of the Indian states and union territories thus far.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11


Fiscal responsibility legislation. The government’s medium-term consolidation path should be
underpinned by a strengthened Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act. In particular, the
design of future fiscal responsibility legislation could be enhanced by using a rule that provides room
for countercyclical fiscal policy—such as capping nominal expenditure growth in addition to a deficit
rule with built-in flexibility (see Selected Issues Chapter V).
Unless such comprehensive fiscal measures are instituted, fiscal adjustment will likely be met through
expenditure compression (including lower capital spending) or an underfunding of important social
programs, as has occurred in recent years, which will undermine efforts to enhance economic growth
and inclusiveness. In contrast, success in achieving the authorities’ medium-term fiscal goals would
support business confidence, reinforce the efforts of the RBI’s tight monetary stance in fighting
inflation, lower public sector financing costs, and reduce overall fiscal vulnerabilities.
20.
India’s public debt is projected to decline over the medium term and remains on a
sustainable path. India’s relatively high nominal GDP growth means that public debt (with a
favorable maturity structure, currency composition as well as a captive domestic investor base)
remains on a downward path and is sustainable (see debt sustainability analysis (DSA) of Annex II).
Under the baseline, the public debt-to-GDP ratio is forecast to decline gradually to about 58½
percent over the medium term from its current level of 65½ percent. While the baseline scenario
already uses conservative growth assumptions, large negative growth shocks represent one of the
major risks to the declining debt trajectory.
Authorities’ Views
21.
Staff and the authorities broadly share a common outlook on the path for fiscal
consolidation, with the authorities noting that they are sticking with fiscal adjustment in the
midst of an economic slowdown. Fiscal adjustment in 2014/15 is likely to be accomplished through
expenditure compression, but the authorities do not expect a repeat of previous years’ sharp
reduction in capital spending. Noting recent IMF research suggesting that infrastructure spending
can be sufficiently growth-enhancing to offset some of the direct cost incurred, they emphasize that
they are making a strong effort to preserve the investment budget, carving out fiscal space for it by
reducing lower-priority capital spending items. The authorities pointed out that in August 2014 they
liberalized the project appraisal and approval process in line Ministries, which should accelerate the
pace of public investment approvals, and introduced zero-based budgetary principles to better
prioritize planned spending. The authorities also noted that the Expenditure Management
Commission is expected to propose a number of rationalization measures on the recurrent spending
side, such as a transition to direct benefit transfers, including by linking them to the unique
identification number (Aadhaar) system. Even if capital spending at the central government level, in
the end, faces some reduction to meet the overall deficit target, the authorities are confident that
capital spending at the state level will remain healthy, ensuring that—at the general government
level—compression of capital spending would be kept to a minimum.
22.
The authorities concurred with staff that enhanced revenue mobilization is a priority
over the medium term. Once implemented, they expect that the GST will gradually boost revenue
indirectly not only by promoting faster economic growth, but also by helping move economic
12

INDIA

activity to the formal sector, thereby expanding the tax base and improving compliance. The
authorities noted staff’s proposal on enhancing fiscal responsibility, and considered that, perhaps in
the context of discussions surrounding a renewed fiscal rule, some flexibility regarding the fiscal
deficit target could be introduced. The authorities disagreed with staff on the desirability of merging
direct and indirect tax boards, arguing that functional specialization remains necessary.

C. Maintaining External Stability

REER index (April 2013=100)

23.
India’s external position is broadly consistent with medium-term fundamentals and
desirable policy settings, while reserves are assessed to be adequate (Box 5). International reserves
have increased by about $30 billion over the last year to reach US$320 billion as at end-December 2014

overseas borrowings by banks, facilitated by a
concessional foreign exchange (FX) swap facility offered by the RBI.10 Based on a range of methodologies,
staff assesses the external position to be broadly in line with fundamentals (see Box 6 and Selected Issues
Chapter VI).
24.
The foreign exchange intervention strategy of the RBI (in both spot and forward markets)
is guided by the need to enhance growth, reduce inflation, limit volatility, and build buffers for
precautionary purposes. The RBI’s forward FX purchases have helped it cover forward FX liabilities and
maintain tight monetary conditions to contain inflation.

If global financial market volatility resurfaces, a comprehensive and well-communicated
set of policies will be needed. In this event, staff would recommend exchange rate flexibility (as a key
shock absorber), allowing for an orderly depreciation of the rupee, with judicious FX intervention (both in
the spot and forward markets, and via liquidity provision

measures used successfully by India during the post-May
2013 period—including offering FX swaps to banks to attract NRI deposits and providing dollar liquidity to
oil-marketing companies to limit depreciation—could be used again in the event of the re-emergence of
external pressures (see Selected Issues Chapter VII for an analysis of Indian and EM responses to recent
bouts of global financial market volatility).11 The RBI should also further explore options to increase the
availability of bilateral and multilateral swap lines. 12

Indian corporates and those with unhedged FX
exposures). Given that portfolio debt flows have been volatile in recent years and the exchange rate
has been sensitive to these flows and changes in global risk aversion, attracting more stable sources
of financing would reduce vulnerabilities. A conducive business environment is necessary to attract
more FDI, along with further liberalization of FDI in specific sectors and simplification of procedures.
11

The RBI introduced two foreign exchange swap schemes in September 2013—one to encourage new foreign
exchange deposits into India by non-resident Indians (NRI) with a minimum term of three years; and one to encourage
long-term overseas foreign exchange borrowing by banks. Under both swap schemes, the RBI agreed to sell to banks
on a forward basis and until November 30, 2013, U.S. dollars against rupees at concessional rates, which gives rise to
multiple currency practices (MCP) relating solely to capital transactions. These MCPs are not subject to Fund approval
because the Fund has declined to assert jurisdiction over MCPs relating solely to capital transactions (see BUFF/85/34).
12

India has a swap line with the Bank of Japan of US$50 billion, and the BRICS’ Contingency Reserve Arrangement will
enable India to draw US$6 billion (and another US$12 billion with a Fund program).

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

INDIA

In addition to having permitted FDI in railways, infrastructure and defense sectors, going forward,
higher FDI limits in sectors such as construction and insurance could lead to increased FDI flows.
Nonetheless, further liberalization of external commercial borrowing should proceed cautiously and
be carefully monitored by the RBI, given the potential risks to corporate balance sheets.13
Authorities’ Views
27.
The authorities noted that while India’s external vulnerabilities are reduced, they
intend to further rebuild their external buffers. The authorities are somewhat concerned about
the risks of disorderly monetary policy normalization in advanced countries, as well as loss of export
competitiveness due to prolonged use of unconventional monetary policies by advanced countries.
They welcomed IMF staff analysis showing that India and other EMs have been affected by
unconventional monetary policies of advanced economies, and noted that despite building greater
resilience to external shocks, they would likely be adversely affected by a disorderly reversal of such
policies in the future. The authorities reiterated that they are not targeting any specific level of the
rupee exchange rate, and attributed foreign exchange purchases over the past year to a desire to
rebuild their external buffers. They acknowledge some tension between their foreign exchange
intervention and the focus on reducing inflation, and regard the financial market distortions from
their intervention policy as minimal. They noted that significant progress has been made in creating
a conducive business environment to attract foreign direct investment flows.

end-fiscal year 2013/14, with PSBs’ NPAs reaching 4.7

restructured loans (as a share of total advances) increased slightly from 5.8 to 5.9 percent of total
advances over the last fiscal year.14 Nonetheless, concerns over evergreening remain, as more than
90 percent of those sales of NPAs to ARCs were financed by banks via issuance of security receipts.

14

The RBI’s December 2014 Financial Stability Report shows an increase in gross NPAs across all scheduled
commercial banks to 4.5 percent of gross advances, with stressed assets (the sum of gross NPAs and restructured
assets) increasing by 0.7 percent to 10.7 percent between March and September 2014 for all scheduled commercial
banks, and by 1 percent for PSBs, reaching 12.9 percent over the same period.

2.5 percent to 13.8 percent during 2013/14, the shares of loss-making companies and those with a
leverage ratio above two have increased slightly to 22.9 and 31.4 percent, respectively (see Selected
Issues Chapters VIII and IX).15 As noted in the RBI’s 2013/14 Annual Report, sectors subject to greater
stress—infrastructure, textiles, engineering, metals and products, chemicals, and mining—make up
36 percent of NPAs as of March 2014. Also, as noted in a recent speech by the RBI’s Deputy
Governor, based on the indicative data, the hedge ratio for external commercial borrowings and
foreign currency convertible bonds (excluding natural hedges) declined sharply from about
34 percent of borrowings in 2013/14 to about 15 percent in July–August 2014.16
30.
Weaknesses have been more pronounced in public sector banks, which represent threequarters of banking system assets. These challenges include larger capital needs and weaker asset
quality, which stem in part from large exposure to infrastructure in the last few years. The profitability of
PSBs remains weak, due to lower operating efficiency. Nonetheless, new capital injections for India’s
banks (to meet Basel III requirements and additional capital requirements due to restructured loans being
reclassified as NPAs) are likely to be moderate (see Box 8). A multi-pronged approach is needed to
remedy long-standing structural issues in the PSBs, including weak corporate governance. Such an
approach should entail further disinvestment by the government, while improving corporate governance
and human resource policies, consistent with key recommendations of the Nayak Committee report. 17
Staff welcomes the government’s intention to reduce its shareholdings in PSBs down to 52 percent
and thereby allow the public banks to strengthen their equity capital base.
31.
The RBI has made further progress in financial sector reforms since the 2014 Article IV
consultation. Efforts have focused on strengthening regulation, including important progress on
implementing Basel III, identifying Domestic Systemically Important Banks and imposing capital
surcharges on them, improving the resolution of impaired assets, and expanding access to finance.


The RBI has recently tightened prudential regulations, including requiring ARCs to provide at
least 15 percent equity towards purchases of NPAs, while phasing out (by April 1, 2015) the
ability for many types of loans to be categorized as rescheduled (and thereby face lower
provisioning requirements).



In addition, from July 2014, the RBI has allowed the move of infrastructure and coal sector loans
into five-year term loans with the ability of rollover, which improves the asset-liability structure of
banks. Going forward, the health of the Indian banking system would be best served by ending
the forbearance provided by the current restructuring mechanism for all types of loans.

introduced incremental provisioning and capital requirements for banks’ exposures to entities with unhedged foreign
exchange exposures.
17

In order to improve governance, the government intends to separate the positions of CEO and chairman at PSBs (in
line with the Nayak Committee’s recommendations), except for State Bank of India (SBI). The government also intends
to revise the appointment process for membership of PSBs’ boards.



The RBI has taken steps to remove information asymmetries and enable banks to improve credit
risk management through the establishment of a large borrower database (beginning May 2014).



The RBI intends to subject RBI-regulated non-bank financial corporations (NBFCs) to more
stringent regulatory norms (in line with those for banks), which will help strengthen the stability
of this fast-growing part of the financial sector.18 Although NBFCs’ asset growth has significantly
outpaced bank asset growth since 2011, their assets correspond to only about 13 percent of
bank assets. NBFCs are generally well regulated, with the largest 480 NBFCs (representing around
90 percent of total NBFC assets) subject to RBI regulation and supervision.19

32.
Over the past year, a number of measures were enacted which improved corporate
governance, enhanced the securities market regulator’s (SEBI) enforcement powers, and increased
transparency of participatory notes (P-Notes). Measures expanding the rights of minority investors
helped improve India’s standing in the World Bank’s “Protecting Minority Investors rank” from about 30th
in 2013 to 7th as at June 2014. A recent amendment to the SEBI Act equipped the regulator with powers
of search and seizure; in cases crossing state lines, recourse is now available to a single court in Mumbai,
rather than to civil courts in all involved states. Foreign investors’ ownership of P-Notes was streamlined
by restricting the types of investors who can own such notes.20 Also, brokers which sell P-Notes now
have to provide SEBI with the names of their beneficiaries. India is currently re-negotiating the
double-taxation treaties with several countries, partly in

This includes the largest NBFCs, deposits-taking NBFCs, or those involved in leasing, lending, or securities
investments. The RBI decided to: (i) increase capital minimum requirements from Rs 2.5 million to Rs 20 million (by
March 2017); (ii) require asset finance companies to receive ratings (by March 2016); (iii) require NBFCs with assets
above Rs 5 billion, and all deposit-taking NBFCs to maintain a minimum Tier-1 capital ratio of 10 percent (by March
2017); and require systemically important and deposit-taking NBFCs to provision more (in line with banks). Most of
the new requirements will be phased in over time.
19

However, government-owned NBFCs are not subject to full RBI supervision.

20

P-Notes are a type of derivative instrument which foreign investors can buy through an entity registered in a country with
which India has a double taxation agreement (usually Mauritius, Cyprus, or Singapore), relieving them from the need to
register with SEBI or pay Indian capital gains taxes, and have provided anonymity to such investors.

21

Indian banks are subject to sectoral lending requirements (priority sectors include agriculture, SMEs), but these are
undertaken primarily on a commercial basis, and lead to higher credit offtake and higher growth. Staff analysis finds
that enhanced financial inclusion and access to finance leads to higher economic output and lower inequality (see
Selected Issues Chapter X).

banks) which focus more narrowly on the provision of basic financial services, using new technologies,
while investing only in relatively safe assets such as government securities. Two new banking licenses
were allocated in April 2014, with the provision that at least 25 percent of new branches have to be in
rural areas. The government has launched an ambitious scheme (Jan Dhan Yojana) to provide bank
accounts for each poor Indian family. Each account would include a debit card, accident and life insurance
coverage, and an overdraft facility (to motivate active use of the accounts).
34.
To maintain financial stability and enhance the ability of the financial sector to contribute
to growth, staff supports the following measures:


The RBI should further strengthen regulation for banks’ credit quality classification and require
increased provisioning (particularly for all types of restructured assets under the Corporate Debt
Restructuring framework) to strengthen financial stability.22 Furthermore, bolstering capital
buffers in public sector banks remains essential to ensure the banking sector’s ability to support
the recovery, while allowing the PSBs to meet their Basel III obligations.



Given the increased unhedged FX exposures of large corporates, strengthened monitoring of the
extent of corporate vulnerabilities is warranted.



Staff continues to endorse the 2012 FSAP’s recommendation to reduce group exposure limits in
line with international norms.



The RBI should continue its focus on improving debt recovery by banks, including by providing
incentives to swiftly deal with delinquent borrowers (including through enhancing supervision)
and promoters. Efforts are needed to improve the insolvency legal and institutional framework,
particularly on the implementation side of the Companies Act 2013. This includes building a
larger corps of specialized judges and a cadre of insolvency and workout experts in the private
sector, to facilitate faster insolvency resolution



Steps to update India’s regulatory architecture, drawing upon the recommendations by the
Financial Sector Legislative Reform Commission (FSLRC) and those in consonance with global
regulatory reform, should continue.23



The Statutory Liquidity Requirement should continue to be reduced as the fiscal deficit declines,
which will free up resources for lending to the private sector.



Measures to enhance the corporate bond market should be taken, by improving liquidity in the
secondary market and developing a robust bond holder protection mechanism.



The emphasis on financial inclusion could also be facilitated by new technologies (for example,
Aadhaar-based KYC compliance and Aadhaar-supported direct benefit transfers), including by
utilizing mobile phone payments technology.

22

The RBI’s December 2014 Financial Stability Report finds that provisions would not be able to cover expected losses
from credit risk under certain adverse macroeconomic conditions (based on an analysis of the 60 largest banks).
23

To revamp financial sector laws, the government set up the FSLRC in March 2011. The Commission in its report has
given wide-ranging recommendations, both legislative and nonlegislative, on the institutional, legal, and regulatory
framework and operational changes in the Indian financial sector. The draft Indian Financial Code has been proposed
and includes provisions that aim at replacing existing financial laws.

Authorities’ Views
35.
The authorities emphasized the strong actions taken over the past year to strengthen
the regime for tackling stressed assets. They noted that they are balancing the need to instill
greater payment discipline in borrowers against the challenges faced by banks and infrastructure
firms that are over-leveraged, in some cases due to lack of government action to clear projects in a
timely manner. The authorities have created a database of large borrowers and placed pressure on
“willful defaulters.” At the same time, they recognized the challenges inherent in the ARC mechanism,
and an effort is underway to reform the bankruptcy and insolvency framework.
36.
The authorities view the slowdown in private sector credit growth as primarily due to
weak demand for bank loans, rather than impaired balance sheets of banks. In their view, the
build-up of excess capacity in some sectors during the boom years means that the current recovery
could continue with sluggish credit growth. In addition, they noted that oil marketing companies’
demand for bank credit has fallen in light of much-reduced oil prices. Furthermore, some corporates
are shifting to non-bank financing sources, reflecting in part their lower funding costs. On the supply
side, lenders are now more cautious than previously, given the RBI’s efforts to rein in bad lending
practices, but banks—including the public sector banks—remain well capitalized and liquid.

E. Structural Policies to Boost Growth and Employment
37.
Addressing long-standing supply bottlenecks, especially in the energy, mining and power
sectors, as well as labor and product market reforms, are crucial to achieving faster growth and
job creation. The strong mandate given to the government in May 2014 provides an opportunity to
continue to unlock the productive potential of the country. Key reforms, including those to factor markets
(land, labor, natural resources), are:


Reforms to the power sector and rationalizing natural resource allocation. Addressing structural
challenges in the power sector and natural resource allocation (in particular allowing further
private sector participation in coal mining, including for commercial mining) and pricing are
critical to boosting investment and potential growth.24



Easing land acquisition. As part of ongoing efforts to enhance the pace of land clearances, in
December 2014 the government approved an ordinance to simplify and clarify the process of
acquiring land under the Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act 2013.



Strengthening the business climate. Ongoing efforts to streamline and expedite land and
environmental clearances should continue, as should simplification of procedures to improve
India’s business climate. The authorities’ efforts to improve India’s ranking on the World Bank’s
Doing Business indicators are welcome, particularly in the underperforming areas of resolving
insolvency, enforcing contracts, and trade across borders. Adopting the recommendations of the
Tax Administration Reform Commission would do much to improve the business climate.

24

The government has recently (December 2014) initiated deregulation of the coal industry (through the Coal Mines
Ordinance) by opening commercial mining to private sector participation, and raised administered natural gas prices
(which should incentivize natural gas production).
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

INDIA



Improving labor market flexibility. Recent steps by some states (for example, Rajasthan) to
increase labor market flexibility are welcome and should be complemented by further reforms at
the national level. Such reforms are key to increasing employment in the formal sector,
broadening the manufacturing base, and harnessing India’s demographic dividend. More flexible
labor markets would boost female labor force participation, which has been falling in recent
years (see Selected Issues Chapters XI and XII on India’s progress in meeting the Millennium
Development Goals and employment of women).25



Reorienting expenditure towards growth enhancing and social spending. Structural fiscal reforms
(including tax and subsidy reforms) will create the fiscal space for expenditure on health and
education, as well as on much-needed public infrastructure.



Agricultural reforms. Reforms in agriculture, in particular to reduce inefficiencies in the public
system for food procurement, distribution and storage, as well as lessen impediments to interstate movement of agricultural produce, should be instituted. Factors hampering agricultural
productivity, including inadequate irrigation infrastructure, should be addressed.

Authorities’ Views
38.
There is broad agreement that structural reforms will be needed to achieve higher
potential growth. The authorities noted that efforts to improve the business climate have gathered
new momentum under the current government. The Prime Minister has set the target of dramatically
improving India’s ranking in the World Bank’s Doing Business survey, and a “Make in India”
campaign has been launched to attract investment. They emphasized steps being taken, both at the
center and in the states, to ease labor market restrictions, and pointed to plans for a simplification of
the Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act.

STAFF APPRAISAL
39.
Policy actions have reduced external vulnerabilities, though risks remain. India was hit hard
by global liquidity tightening during the post-May 22, 2013 taper tantrum period. In response, the
authorities’ implemented wide-ranging policies to contain market volatility, accelerate project approvals,
correct imbalances and build buffers against external shocks. While India’s underlying vulnerabilities have
receded, there remains little room for countercyclical macroeconomic policies to respond to domestic and
external shocks.
40.
India’s economic outlook has improved. The near-term growth outlook is favorable, helped by
greater political certainty, several policy actions, improved business confidence, and reduced external
vulnerabilities. Growth appears to have bottomed out and is expected to strengthen gradually as a result
of the revival in industrial and investment activity, and steps taken to alleviate supply-side
bottlenecks. India’s persistently-high inflation has moderated recently, due to favorable base effects,
a tight monetary stance, lower global commodity prices, and government efforts to contain food

Reduction,” IMF WP 14/63.

inflation. Nonetheless, inflation remains a key concern given its ingrained nature and elevated
inflation expectations. Tight fiscal and monetary policies are needed to continue to narrow
macroeconomic imbalances.
41.
Notwithstanding brighter economic prospects, downside risks remain. On the external
side, despite the strengthening of buffers and reduced vulnerabilities, spillovers from weak global
growth and global financial market volatility could be very disruptive, including from any unexpected
developments in the course of U.S. monetary policy normalization. Domestic risks include
heightened weaknesses in corporate balance sheets and worsening bank asset quality, as well as
slower-than-expected progress in addressing supply-side bottlenecks, which could weigh on growth.
On the upside, expedited structural reforms and faster implementation of cleared investment
projects could lead to stronger growth, as would a further decline in global energy prices.
42.
Monetary policy needs to remain tight to consolidate recent gains in reducing inflation.
In the absence of supply-side measures to raise potential output and constrain food price inflation,
maintaining a tight monetary stance is needed to durably bring down inflation and achieve the RBI’s
6 percent CPI inflation objective by 2016. To lower inflation durably over the medium term, a tight
monetary policy stance will need to be accompanied by further structural reforms. Continued progress is
needed to further strengthen the monetary policy framework and move towards flexible inflation
targeting.
43.
While continuing fiscal consolidation is welcome, the quality of fiscal adjustment
should be improved. Recent fiscal consolidation has been achieved largely as a result of cuts in
capital spending, while tax revenues have stagnated. The October 2014 diesel-price deregulation and
capping of LPG subsidies are welcome and are expected to help lower the fuel subsidy bill. The
medium-term fiscal targets are broadly appropriate, but appear challenging in the absence of clearly
articulated measures that would underpin the targeted fiscal adjustment. Significant tax reforms
(including through introduction of the GST and better tax administration) and rationalizing subsidies
(including through further reductions in fuel and fertilizer subsidies and untargeted food subsidies)
will be required to create the fiscal space for higher growth-enhancing capital spending and social
expenditures.
44.
The external position is broadly consistent with medium-term fundamentals, while
reserves are assessed to be adequate. Given India’s increased and adequate reserve buffers, greater
exchange rate flexibility would be welcome and thereby encourage private sector entities to limit
excessive risk taking. Foreign exchange intervention should be limited to preventing disruptive
movements in the exchange rate. If global financial market volatility resurfaces, exchange rate flexibility
should be an important shock absorber. The current account deficit financing mix could be improved
by enhancing the environment for attracting stable, non-debt creating capital flows, particularly FDI.
Further liberalization of external commercial borrowing should proceed cautiously, given the
potential vulnerabilities of corporate balance sheets.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

21

45.
While the Indian banking system is well capitalized, slow growth and heightened corporate
vulnerabilities have led to a deterioration in bank asset quality. The RBI should further strengthen
regulation for banks’ credit quality classification, require increased provisioning, continue to monitor
corporates’ FX unhedged exposures, and reduce group exposure limits in line with international
norms to bolster financial stability. Furthermore, augmenting capital buffers in public sector banks
remains essential to ensure the banking sector’s ability to provide adequate credit to support the
recovery, while allowing public banks to meet Basel III capital requirements. Over the medium term,
the authorities should implement their plan to reduce the public shareholding in public sector banks
to 52 percent, and improve corporate governance at public banks.
46.
Reforms to labor and product markets, as well as alleviating long-standing supply
bottlenecks, are crucial to achieving faster, more inclusive growth. Tackling structural challenges in
the power sector and natural resource allocation and pricing, are critical to boosting investment and
potential growth. Ongoing efforts to streamline and expedite land and environmental clearances
should continue, as should simplification of procedures to improve India’s business climate. Further
reforms to increase labor market flexibility are key to increasing employment in the formal sector
and broadening India’s manufacturing base.

Set up four Task Forces to assist the government in preparing the roadmap for the establishment of new agencies as per
the recommendations of FSLRC committee report. Government allowed Public Sector Banks (PSBs) to raise capital to
meet their additional capital requirements under Basel III (due by 2019) by diluting the government’s shareholding in
PSBs to 52 percent in a phased manner (issued December 2014).
Monetary Policy
RBI accepted Patel Committee recommendations to anchor CPI headline inflation with a "glide path" for achieving 8

Risks identified on mission

Addressing system-wide risks

Actions since 2013 Article IV Mission (Nov. 2012)
Further risk reduction. Banks were directed to check their
corporate customers’ unhedged FX-exposures and to
appropriately reserve against those in line with formulas
provided by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and to exchange
information about them. Non-compliance can be penalized
by supervisors.

In order to get a comprehensive overview of the exposures of
larger corporates, the RBI is setting up the "large borrower’s
database." Banks are supposed to provide information on
Enhance RBI monitoring of corporate indebtedness,
refinancing risk, and foreign exchange exposures. (¶13 - corporates whose total exposure exceeds Rs 50 million
(including ECBs extended by Indian overseas bank offices and
FSSA)
branches). This database is up and running now, albeit data
quality and operational issues have to be ironed out before
the data can be fully relied upon. The data will inform the RBI
about corporate exposures, but will be also shared with the
banks. It is intended for the system to later be merged with
the information compiled about FX-exposures. Since
December 2013, banks also have to report accounts past due
between 61-90 days, and have to set up a joint lenders’
committee for those with exposures in excess of Rs 1 billion.
Further reduction of vulnerabilities and risks. A law is
being drafted to remove members of boards of public banks
who are related to supervisory agencies.

Improve the performance and financial strength of
public financial institutions and subject them to full
supervision and regulation. (¶20)

The Nayak Committee published its report on the governance
of banks in May 2014, recommending significant changes to
governance in public sector banks (PSBs). The authorities
stated that they are closely looking at the report's
recommendations, with an eye to implementing a number of
those. The announced intention of the Government of India
to reduce its shareholdings in PSBs to 52 percent will be
supportive in that process.
The mission was informed that some of the public financial
institutions are non-bank financial corporations (NBFCs),
which are not subject to RBI oversight. RBI has recommended
that they be made subject to RBI oversight. No change in the
law is needed for that.
It should be noted that the FSLRC will restructure India's
financial supervisory system completely, likely leading to
greater centralization.

Financial sector oversight
Strengthen oversight of banks’ overseas operations
through Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs) with
host countries, onsite inspections, and supervisory
colleges. (¶35)

Additional risk reduction. Additional MOUs are being
negotiated and signed. RBI has hosted supervisory colleges
for Indian banks with a major international presence.
Overseas offices of five large Indian banks representing 86
percent of total overseas assets have been inspected so far.

Enhance formal statutory basis for the autonomy of
regulators in carrying out their regulatory and
supervisory functions. (¶35, 41, 46)

Additional risk reduction. See point 2 above (“Further
reduction of vulnerabilities and risks”).
The RBI notes that it currently cannot revoke the license of a
PSB, since they are organized as state-owned enterprises,
outside the Companies' Act. The RBI is asking the government
to change that. This would necessitate a change in the
relevant legislation.

Tighten the definition of large and related party
concentration (short-term) and reduce exposure limits
to align them with international practices. (¶35)

No additional risk reduction. The authorities are committed
to bring India in line with the 'Final Standard' for connected
counterparties (disseminated by the Basel Committee for
Banking Supervision in April 2014) by January 2019. However,
they noted that India's current limits, which are above the
international norms, are needed in order to facilitate financing
particularly for infrastructure purposes. The RBI will soon issue
a discussion paper on this subject.

Enhance specialized expertise available to the
supervision function by developing programs to
accredit and retain skilled supervisors. (¶37)

Some risk reduction is taking place. The RBI's human
resources department is working on setting up a new
certification system for supervisors. Also, a more structured
and quantitative approach is being employed, based on a
more intensive use of models. The U.S. Federal Reserve's
approach to the accreditation of bank-internal credit models
is being used. New training programs are being devised in
cooperation with the World Bank's Financial Sector
Development Program, as well as collaborative programs with
other external agencies.
A particular challenge exists with regards to the training of
NBFC supervisors, because of the variety of business models
and issues that prevail in that area.

Continue to strengthen coordination and information
sharing mechanisms among domestic supervisors via
MOUs and formal frameworks. (¶49, 67)

Further reduction in risk. A Financial Stability and
Development Council (FSDC) has been set up to strengthen
financial stability, financial sector development, and interregulatory coordination. A subcommittee headed by the RBI
Governor was also set up, with same membership as FSDC.
An inter-regulatory committee to help the banking sector to
comply with Basel III norms was set up in March 2014, with a
number of working groups focused on issues of financial
inclusion, monitoring of financial conglomerates, and other
issues. The inter-regulatory committee has initiated work on a
repository which will capture all accounts of an individual or
other entity.
Regulators are also working across agencies on specific issues
and companies, when they span the purview of several
agencies. A MOU between the RBI, SEBI, and other agencies
was signed to facilitate the supervision of conglomerate
entities. The RBI was also enabled to receive information
directly from entities associated with banks.
The supervision of commodities exchanges was shifted to the
Ministry of Finance from the Ministry of Corporate Affairs in
order to make supervision more comprehensive, and avoid
regulatory arbitrage (2013).

Text Table 2. India FSAP Main Recommendations and Risks: December 2014 Update (Continued)
Provide a lead supervisor with legal backing for
conducting consolidated supervision with authority to
inspect subsidiaries and affiliates. (¶49)

Additional risk reduction. Section 29a of the Banking Law
was amended, which enables banking supervisors to inspect
companies associated with any bank. The Law’s provisions
also enable a joint inspection of enterprises associated with
banks by the RBI and other relevant regulators.

Expedite passage of Insurance Law (Amendment) Bill.
(¶43)

Not passed yet.

Implement corrective action ladder for insurers. (¶45)

No change.

Enact legislation formalizing the New Pension Scheme
and the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development
Authority. (¶33)

Significant risk reduction. The new Pension Law (PFRDA)
was passed.

Plan for the reduction in the Statutory Liquidity Ratio
(SLR) and review the use of the hold-to-maturity
category, incorporating changing global liquidity
requirements. (¶51)

Some changes. The authorities want to keep the SLR as a
monetary tool. Five percentage points of the SLR can be used
for repo with the RBI for up to 30 days, representing high
quality liquid assets; an additional two percentage points can
be used to access the Marginal Standing Facility (MSF).

Strengthen resolution tools by granting stronger
powers to supervisors to resolve nonviable entities in
an orderly fashion. (¶53)

Some risk reduction. Work on this is in the planning stage.
An internal working group had produced a plan on the
resolution regime for financial institutions, while a task force
under the FSLRC has been set up to work on an interagency
basis. The RBI Governor has made this issue a priority.
Vulnerabilities therefore still persist.
The working group on resolution has also made
recommendations for the resolution of NBFCs.

Develop and periodically test arrangements to deal
with a major disruption to the financial system. (¶54,
66)

Some risk reduction. Work on this, both at the level of the
Ministry of Finance and the RBI, is progressing. A crisis
management group has been set up inside the RBI, while the
inter-regulatory committee of the FSDC has set up an early
warning group. Crisis arrangements for the payments system
have been tested.
A core settlement guarantee fund was set up at the Clearing
Corporation of India (CCIL); SEBI also issued more granular
norms for stress testing and the harmonization of default
waterfalls across clearing corporations.

Broadening markets and services

Ease investment directives and limits to encourage
investments in corporate and infrastructure bonds by
institutional investors. (¶34, 62)

Additional measures implemented. Taxes on FX-bonded
debt were reduced; three types of investment limits for
foreign investors were consolidated into one limit of $51
billion; and new infrastructure investment schemes were
implemented, one focused on foreigners. The one-year lockin period for foreigners was removed.
New guidelines were issued for insurers and pension funds,
which should increase their participation in those markets.
Corporate and infrastructure bonds can be used as collateral
in repo with banks.
Bonds issued for purposes of infrastructure financing are
exempt from CRR and can be deducted from SLR
requirements. Pension funds can now invest now in corporate
and infrastructure bonds with a minimum rating of AA. In
addition to a number of other measures providing greater
flexibility for institutional investors when investing and
trading bonds, mutual funds can now also use AA-rated
corporate bonds in repo transactions. SEBI has also provided
guidelines for the trading of bonds on stock exchanges.

Some progress. Limits on foreign institutional investor (FII)
investments in GSecs and T-bills together were combined into
one, and increased to $30 billion.

Financial market infrastructure

Require Central Counterparty Clearinghouses to
strengthen their liquidity risk management procedures
to enable them to better cover losses in the event of a
member’s failure. (¶66)

Consider replacing the commercial bank settlement
model for corporate securities and derivatives with a
central bank settlement model. (¶66)

Enact comprehensive modern corporate insolvency law
and upgrade SARFAESI (Securitization and
Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Notable risk reduction. Credit lines of Rs 27 billion are now
available to Central Counterparty Clearinghouses for their
settlement with the RBI, and Rs 63 billion in lines at
designated settlement banks. US$ 750 million in lines were
made available for FX clearing.
SEBI advised the Central Counterparties (CCPs) to effectively
measure, monitor, and manage liquidity risk, in line with the
CPSS-IOSCO Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures.
SEBI requires CCPs to test the adequacy of their clearing
arrangement.
The issue of the RBI providing liquidity support to CCPs of
stock exchanges will be looked at in the future.
Some progress. A committee of SEBI and the RBI is working
on this issue. A working group favors the current settlement
model of CCIL, where clearing corporations and clearing
banks settle via their central bank accounts.
Partial progress. New insolvency statutes have been passed
as part of the Companies Act. Its passing should be beneficial
for the insolvency process, decreasing uncertainty and
increasing credit availability particularly for small- and
medium-sized enterprises.
The Government of India has set up a committee to devise an
entrepreneur-friendly bankruptcy framework.

Against the background of weakened potential
growth and with actual GDP growth falling below
5 percent in both 2012/13 and 2013/14, excess
supply has emerged. However, given the limited
policy space, tight fiscal and monetary policies have
had to be put in place to rein in India’s persistentlyhigh inflation and current account deficit pressures.
Rebuilding policy space will enable room for
credible counter-cyclical aggregate demand
management policies going forward.

India’s potential growth slowdown in recent
years appears to have been driven largely by the
decline in trend total factor productivity (TFP)
growth. Specifically, the contribution of TFP is
estimated to have declined from about 3
percentage points during the high-growth period
of 2002–07 to about 2 percentage points during
2011–13. A sector-based growth analysis reveals
that the slowdown was more pronounced in
sectors affected by regulatory and infrastructure
bottlenecks, pointing to the importance of
addressing supply-side constraints.

India: Estimated Contributions to Trend Growth

1994

Staff estimates suggest India’s potential output
growth is about 6¾ percent in the medium
term. A range of empirical approaches used to
estimate potential growth indicate that India’s
trend growth peaked at about 8 percent just before
the Global Financial Crisis of 2008, but has declined
in recent years to around 6–7 percent. Similarly, the
Reserve Bank of India has also recently lowered its
estimate of potential growth to about 7 percent.

Box 2. Balance-Sheet Analysis (BSA) of the Indian Economy1
The balance-sheet matrix depicts gross asset and liability positions of different sectors of the
Indian economy, and is used to assess risks and cross-sector spillovers. The BSA for India is based
on the flow of funds data as published by the Reserve Bank of India—consisting of 2011/12 data on
the sources and uses of funds of the following sectors: (i) Banking, (ii) Other Financial Institutions, (iii)
Private Corporate Business, (iv) Government, (v) Rest of the World, and (vi) Households. Of these six
sectors, flows from the rest of the world constitute only 9 percent of total inter-sectoral financial flows
(indicating the relatively-closed nature of the Indian economy), while the banking sector and other
financial institutions form about 40 percent of total inter-sectoral financial flows (highlighting a mainly
bank-based financial system).
The banking system is mostly exposed to the government (representing 50 percent of their
assets). This is primarily due to the fact that banks have been restricted by regulation in their use of
funds, including from reserve requirements as well as the regulation to invest a portion of their funds
in government securities and lend to “priority sectors”. Other financial institutions (OFIs) are of two
types: (i) term-lending institutions which obtain most of their funds from banks and intermediate
them to corporates; or (ii) insurance funds, public provident fund, or unit trusts that are mainly
financed by households (magnitudes of exposures are reflected in the Table below).
The linkage between the financial and real sectors comes from households’ financial savings as
well as physical investment made by deficit sectors: private corporate sector and government.
An important financial asset of the household’s portfolio is bank deposits, which is, in turn an
important source of funds for banks. Apart from statutory requirement in the use of funds, the two
assets where banks can actually exercise choice are: excess reserves and loans to corporates (affected
by monetary and fiscal policies as well as portfolio choice of saving households). The liabilities of
corporates amount to 30 percent of India’s total inter-sectoral financial borrowings as at end 2011/12,
and are mainly financed from the rest of the world sector (23 percent), the banking system (18
percent), or OFIs (15 percent). There has been a marked increase in leverage of the private nonfinancial corporate sector since early 2000s, reflecting easy global and domestic financial conditions.
Corporates have resorted to market financing, including external borrowing (in the form of External
Commercial Borrowings and Foreign Currency Convertible Bonds), partly reflecting lower financial
savings by households (resulting from elevated inflation and inflation expectations, and higher gold
purchases), and higher government financing requirements.
We identify the following risks and cross-sector spillover channels from our BSA. The main risk
is the weakness in corporate balance sheets (including a large exposure to rest of the world). Further
corporate stress could emerge from a surge in global financial market volatility (affecting one of the
main sources of funds for corporates), adding to banks’ non-performing assets (NPAs), raising capital
concerns and reducing lending in the medium term. Further deterioration in banks’ asset quality,
especially in public banks, could constrain credit supply given the high share of government in banks’
portfolio of assets. Despite the fact that a captive domestic investor base mitigates the impact of any
real interest rate shocks, the share of government in the asset portfolio of banks is very high and
2
should be gradually reduced over time (alongside further fiscal consolidation).

Box 3. Does Inflation Slow Long-Run Growth in India?1

Real GDP Growth

Is there a non-linear long-run relationship between consumer price index industrial workers
(CPI-IW) inflation and GDP growth in India? The inflation-growth trade-off and the role of monetary
policy in India have received renewed interest among policy makers and academics in recent years as
persistently-high inflation and weak growth have co-existed. The conventional view is that inflation at
low levels “greases the wheels” of the economy, while at high levels it negatively affects the economy’s
allocative efficiency and growth. In other words,
Real GDP Growth and Inflation in India (All States),
1989-2013
while the short-run Phillips Curve postulates that
25
inflation tolerance could be associated with higher
20
growth, persistently-high inflation, especially
15
beyond a certain threshold, (by itself) could be a
10
5
drag on economic growth in the long run. We
0
provide a re-examination of the inflation-growth
-5
relationship in a sample of 14 Indian states over the
-10
period 1989–2013, and estimate the threshold level
-15
of inflation beyond which growth is more severely
-5
0
5

undermined.
A key finding is that there are significant negative long-run effects of persistently-elevated
inflation on growth in India, and a growth-inhibiting inflation threshold of 5.5 percent. Our
findings suggest that, on average, there is a negative long-run relationship between inflation and
growth in India. Statistically-significant inflation-growth threshold effects are found for states with
persistently-elevated inflation rates of above 5.5 percent. Specifically: (i) at low enough levels of
inflation (below 3 percent) we do not observe any statistically-significant effects of inflation on output
growth; (ii) average growth is higher for those states and periods which experienced inflation below
5.5 percent; and (iii) when inflation is greater than 3 percent, we observe a negative and statisticallysignificant effect of inflation on long-run growth (with this negative effect being larger when inflation is
above 5.5 percent).
This suggests the need for the authorities to balance the short-term growth–inflation trade–off,
in light of the long-term negative effects on growth of persistently-high inflation. Inflation in
India is driven by both supply and demand-side factors (including the National Rural Employment
Guarantee Act, supply bottlenecks, food and energy price pressures, and elevated inflation
expectations). Nonetheless, inflation remains one of the most important problems facing India’s
economy. Therefore, the authorities (via supply-side reforms as well as monetary policy) should
strengthen their anti-inflation efforts in order to avoid any negative long-run effects of excessive
inflation on growth.

Box 4. Goods and Services Tax and Tax Administration in India1
India’s government sector is underresourced, as revenue as a share of GDP has
stagnated, after falling sharply in 2008, and is
now well below EM peers. Moreover, revenue
ratios at the general government level mask a
concern about the central government, which
retains own revenue of only about 9 percent of
GDP, after statutory transfers to India’s states.
Against this backdrop, India is moving towards
introduction of a new goods and services tax, as
well as considering measures to improve tax
administration.

Goods and services tax (GST). A well-functioning GST will enhance tax compliance, and over time, following
the creation of a single market, boost growth, perhaps by as much as 1–1½ percent of GDP (see NCAER
report: http://bit.ly/1rYbdCv). However in the near term, the GST may not add substantially to revenue, as it
would replace a number of central and state level indirect taxes. Further, the center is expected to guarantee
compensation—for a limited time—to states which lose revenue. The GST design being contemplated is also
fairly complex, with a dual administration arrangement that involves the tax authorities of both the center
and the states separately taxing a single transaction. Issues that will require further work include crediting
across interstate borders, settlement of revenue sharing, and building capacity in states to tax services.
Revenue administration. There is also scope for garnering revenue through improved tax administration.
Despite a population of 1.2 billion, there are only about 40 million direct taxpayers, both corporate and
individual. A broader tax base and better compliance management could yield additional revenues. In 2013,
the Ministry of Finance established a high-level tax administration reform commission (TARC). The TARC
reports propose a thorough modernization of the revenue administration framework in India, to enhance
revenue performance, improve the business climate by simplifying procedures, and tilt the corporate culture
of India’s revenue administration toward customer service (http://bit.ly/1vpnVER). Key recommendations are:









Reorganization of revenue administration along functional lines—to promote better data sharing and a
comprehensive understanding of tax payers’ businesses—by merging the central boards of direct and
indirect taxes and customs
More sophisticated use of integrated data bases and information technology
Making the large taxpayer unit mandatory, instead of voluntary as at present
Changing some tax policies to capture better-off individuals, including in the currently untaxed rural
sector by taxing high income (over Rs 5 million, or about $83,000) farmers
Raising the quality of tax administration professionals through skill development
Improved dispute resolution processes that are faster, less adversarial and more collaborative and
customer focused
Strengthening the tax policy function in the Ministry of Finance by creating a Tax Council, headed by the
Chief Economic Advisor.

The reform of revenue administration in India would be a multi-year endeavor, but it should reduce fiscal
vulnerabilities by closing some of the revenue gap with EM peers.

Box 5. Assessing Reserve Adequacy in India1
India’s international reserves have increased by $45 billion since September 2013 to reach $320
billion as at end-December 2014. The build-up of reserves is mainly driven by three factors. The first
is the sharp fall in India’s current account deficit (CAD)—the CAD narrowed to 1.7 percent of GDP in
2013/14, a 3 percentage point of GDP reduction from the previous year, and is projected to remain at
about 1.8 percent of GDP in 2014/15. Second is the inflow of about $34 billion of non-resident Indian
deposits and overseas borrowings by banks, facilitated by a concessional FX swap facility offered by
the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) following the U.S. quantitative easing taper tantrum of summer 2013.
The third factor is robust foreign institutional investor (FII) inflows—FIIs have made about $48 billion in
net purchases of Indian equities and debt between September 2013 and December 2014.
Given that any sudden stops or reversal of capital inflows could expose India to significant risks,
holding an adequate level of international reserves is essential for the country to reduce its
vulnerability. India is susceptible to surges in global financial market volatility (which could be
triggered by monetary policy normalization in advanced economies) as well as commodity-price
shocks, and should hold reserves for precautionary purposes. However, there is little consensus in the
literature on what constitutes an adequate level of reserves from a precautionary perspective. This Box
analyses international reserves in India using the reserve optimizing model of Jeanne and Ranciere
(2011), and compares the findings with those of the IMF’s risk-weighted metric (2013).2 The results
show that India’s international reserve levels are adequate to cover a broad set of risks.
The Reserve Optimizing Model of Jeanne and Ranciere (2011): This model describes reserve
accumulation as an optimization problem in which risk-averse policy makers choose the level of
reserves to provide optimal insurance against a sudden stop in consumption, given the cost of holding
reserves. When a sudden stop occurs, external debt cannot be rolled over and output falls below its
long-run growth path. More reserves mitigate the fall in output and help smooth national
consumption. However, there is a cost to holding reserves as they yield a lower return than other assets
in the economy. In this model the optimal level of reserves is determined by the size and probability of
the sudden stop, the potential loss in output and consumption, the opportunity cost of holding
reserves, and the degree of risk aversion. Based on a calibrated version of this model to Indian data,
the optimal level of reserves in India is estimated to be just above the projected actual holdings in
2014 (text chart).
IMF’s Risk Weighted Approach (2013) employs a metric that reflects the relative risk levels of
different potential sources of balance of payments pressure—the relative risk weights are based on tail
event outflows associated with periods of exchange market pressure in different countries—and assess
how large a stock of reserves might be needed relative to this risk weighted measure, to cover for
outflows from different sources. For India the metric is constructed as 30% of short-term debt + 15%
of other portfolio liabilities + 5% of M2 + 5% of exports. Coverage in the region of 100-150 percent of
the metric can be regarded as adequate. India’s reserve coverage against the proposed adequacy
range of 100-150 percent (dashed lines) is shown below. In 2014, the projected level of reserves in
India is at 148 percent of the IMF’s reserve adequacy metric (text chart).

Overall, India’s level of foreign reserves is
adequate to cover a broad set of risks. However no
one measure can fully capture the range of factors
that bear on a country’s resilience against shocks.
Moreover, international reserves are only one part of
a country’s defense against shocks. As a complement
to these approaches, regression analysis of observed
reserve holdings against a range of precautionary
variables can be used to infer the degree to which
India’s actual reserve levels are consistent with those
of peers. While it could be argued that a sound
macroeconomic and prudential policy framework is
probably more important than reserves in limiting
country vulnerabilities, the present uncertainties in
global financial markets due to the prolonged use of
accommodative monetary policies by advanced
economies may warrant holding higher level of
reserves than suggested by the IMF’s reserves
adequacy framework.

Box 6. External Sector Assessment1
Staff assesses that India’s external position is broadly consistent with medium-term fundamentals and
desirable policy settings.
Current Account and Exchange Rates
After a major adjustment in fiscal year (FY) 2013/14, the current account deficit (CAD) is projected to
widen slightly to about 2 percent of GDP in FY2014/15 as domestic demand strengthens. The EBA CA
regression estimates a norm of about -4.2 percent of GDP for India in FY2014/15. However, in staff’s
judgment, global financial markets could not be counted on to reliably finance a deficit of that size, in
light of India’s current (albeit reduced) vulnerabilities. Given the risks associated with global financial
market volatility, staff assesses that a smaller CAD of about 2½ percent of GDP is a more appropriate
norm. This level is higher than the estimated underlying CAD of about 2 percent of GDP in FY2014/15.
The CA gap is therefore estimated to be in a range of -1 to +1 percent of GDP.
The real effective exchange rate appreciated by about 5 percent between March and October 2014, in
comparison with a 7 percent depreciation during FY2013/14. The EBA REER regression approach
estimates a slight gap of about +2 percent for the 2014 average REER. Staff assesses the REER gap for
2014 to be in the range of -5 to +5 percent, and is in line with the CA gap assessment. The EBA ES
(external sustainability) approach estimates a CA norm of about -1.7 percent of GDP, as the CA
consistent with holding the NFA-to-GDP ratio at its current level (-25.6 percent of GDP).2
Capital Account Flows and International Investment Position
India’s financial account has been dominated by portfolio equity and FDI flows. However, the
composition of CA financing has recently shifted toward more debt flows, particularly in the form of NRI
deposits and external commercial borrowings. The financing mix should be improved by enhancing the
environment for attracting stable non-debt-creating capital flows.

However as noted in the IMF’s 2014 Pilot External Sector Report, such a norm is of little interest, as India’s net
external position is only moderately negative and is not on a deteriorating trend.

ARCs grew at an unprecedented pace albeit from a
low base, amounting to more than Rs 120 billion
during the fourth quarter of FY2013/14.
Sources: Reserve Bank of India; and IMF staff calculations.
The acquisition of impaired assets by ARCs is usually carried out through special purpose
vehicles, which are financed through the issue of security receipts (SRs), of which most—up to
95 percent—were held by the banks that had sold the assets, and the remainder by the ARCs.
Regulatory changes implemented in late 2013 and early 2014 made NPA sales more attractive for both
banks and ARCs.2
In the first half of 2014, the share of ARC capital backing newly acquired NPAs averaged only
around eight percent. In turn, the NPA disposal to ARCs became attractive for banks because of
relatively high prices paid for impaired assets of up to 60 percent of their face value (versus a historical
25 percent). However, strong concerns over the effectiveness of ARCs in cleaning up bank balance
sheets and reducing their credit risks remain, as banks, through their subscription to the SRs issued
against the transferred impaired assets, effectively remained responsible for the bulk of the remaining
risk. Indeed, some bank analysts have begun to add the value of a bank’s SRs to their disclosed
stressed assets. Estimates suggest that the amount of SRs held by banks represent about 0.3 percent of
advances.3
The RBI’s August 2014 amendments to the ARCs regulatory framework aim to address the
misaligned incentive structure of the ARC mechanism. The most important changes include: (i)
ARCs will have to supply 15 percent equity into each SPV; (ii) ARCs will have to charge fees on net asset
values, not the value of the SRs issued; and (iii) ARC assets will have to be revalued after six months,
rather than 12 months. These measures should help the pricing of NPA sales to ARCs better reflect the
true economic value of the underlying claims, rather than accounting considerations or skewed riskreturn tradeoffs previously faced by ARCs.

Important changes were the easing of accounting rules regarding NPAs sold to ARCs, permitting the sale of
early-stage NPAs, and a number of measures which improved the economics of ARCs.
3

With gross NPAs across the scheduled commercial banks at 4.1 percent of outstanding advances (as of March
2014), this represents a notable number. For some PSBs, those numbers are higher. For instance, in the case of
Bank of India, SRs amount to 1.1 percent of advances.

Box 8. Potential Capital Needs of India’s Commercial Banks1
India’s banks are likely to require additional capital injections over the next several years,
reflecting their challenging operating environment, combined with the RBI's revised guidance
on the implementation of Basel III capital requirements. The challenges on the business front are
embodied in banks’ increased restructured advances, which comprised 5.9 percent of the banking
systems’ gross advances, and 7.2 percent of the PSBs advances as of March 2014. Although not
considered non-performing, restructured assets indicate that borrowers are experiencing difficulties in
servicing debt and thus imply subpar asset quality. The rapid rise of restructured assets in recent years
has raised concerns about the financial strength of many Indian banks. Here we stress-test the banks’
capital position to a sudden deterioration in loan quality and evaluate the impact of Basel III capital
requirements.

Tier 1 Ratio (%)

A stress test of banks’ balance sheets indicates that the PSBs are vulnerable to a change in
classification of a significant share of restructured loans as non-performing assets (NPAs). Each
bank’s balance sheet was stressed individually, based on 45 percent of restructured advances moving
2,3
to NPAs, and those NPAs being provisioned against loss at a minimum 60 percent. All banks are
assessed with regards to their Tier 1 capital ratio
Loan Impairments vs. Tier 1 Ratio, March 2014 (post-shock)
and the ratio of impaired loans net of provisions.
18
As of March 2014, the average Tier 1 ratio was

banks compared to public sector banks.

Furthermore, private banks’ impaired-loans-toMean Private Banks

points lower. Post-stress, the average Tier 1 ratio

decreased by about 1.6 percentage points for the

points for private banks (Figure). This is reflective
of the weaker capital positions and the higher levels of stressed assets in PSBs.
Capital injections by the government required to meet PSBs’ Basel III requirements will likely
be moderate, provided the private sector supplies a considerable share (Table). The capital needs
of banks will increase with faster credit growth, and given that banks will be required to hold at least
the March 2019 regulatory minimum for Tier 1 capital ratio of 5.5 percent of risk-weighted assets, or 8
percent including the 2.5 percent capital conversation buffer (CCB). In addition, most banks will likely
hold an extra cushion in excess of the required minimum (we simulate an excess of 1 and 2
percentage points of additional capital). The highlighted cells reflecting results of scenarios deemed
most relevant. With simulations based on return on assets (ROA) of 0.9 percent for the PSBs (in line
with 2012-13 average ROA), the recapitalization cost for the central government is estimated to be
between 0.8 to 1.1 percent of FY 2018/19 GDP, under the assumption of unchanged public-private
ownership shares. However, if the government were to provide the full amount of required capital
injection, the estimate rises to between 1.2 to 1.7 percent of 2018/19 GDP. In a scenario where
government ownership is reduced to 52 percent over time, the required capital injection is in the
range of 0.7 to 1 percent of 2018/19 GDP.4

1/ Simulations based on 2012 data (except ROA and ROE, where 2011 and 2012 averages are used).
2/ A 15 percent transition rate from restructured loans to NPAs is assumed.
3/ Numbers equal Equity Tier 1 ratio plus Capital Conversion Buffer plus additional cushion of zero, 1, or 2
percentage points.

Additional Tier 1 (AT1) capital will have to be raised beyond CET1 requirements. AT1 capital can
be raised in the form of bonds which are either convertible into equity, or will have to take haircuts, in
the event that pre-specified CET1 ratios are breached. In the scenarios deemed more likely, for PSBs
those requirements will amount to less than ½ of one percent of GDP. However, it is recommended
that supervisors make sure that sales to non-institutional investors appropriately disclose the risks
related to loss absorption inherent in those bonds.
Under scenarios which assume moderate credit growth, and a continued challenging operating
environment similar to 2012/13, total required capital injections from the government are
likely to manageable. Under current equity market valuations, and the government's announced
intention to reduce its share in all PSBs to 52 percent, lower capital injections by the government may
be needed. In addition, further reforms, especially to enhance the operating performance and the
credit culture of the PSBs will help reduce the capital injection needs.

The average provisioning ratio of private sector banks is slightly above 60 percent; this provisioning ratio was
used as a minimum. If a bank’s provisioning ratio for 2012/13 exceeded 60 percent, the actual number was used.

Historically, about 15 percent of restructured advances have moved into NPAs, with this number moving close
to 20 percent in recent months. The authorities have used a maximum 30 percent transition rate in their stress
tests.

Domestic Risks
Slower-thanexpected progress
in addressing

bottlenecks

M

M: Slower-than-expected progress in addressing supply
side bottlenecks could weigh on growth and stoke
inflation, thereby it could undermine macroeconomic
and financial stability.

Continue to address long-standing supply
bottlenecks, especially in the energy, mining and
power sectors, as well as labor market reforms.
Strengthen business climate and address factors
hampering agricultural productivity.

Strong pick-up in
inflation

M

M–H: A strong pick-up in inflation could discourage
financial saving, erode external competitiveness and
generate external imbalances. It also hurts the poor,
especially in urban areas, the most. High inflation
expectations could increase the economic costs of
bringing inflation down in a sustainable way, further
damaging growth.

Raising interest rates until inflation is clearly on
a downward trend. Improved agricultural
productivity and investing in infrastructure to
improve the supply response can reduce food
price pressures.

Balance sheet
risks

M

H: Continued corporate stress could add to bank NPAs,
raising capital concerns and reducing lending in the
medium term.

Strengthened oversight of financial and
corporate risks. Raising provisioning
requirements. Policies to incentivize genuine
corporate restructuring and improvements to
insolvency framework.

A surge in
financial market
volatility

H

M: While external vulnerabilities have declined
considerably, the impact from a surge in global
financial market volatility could be disruptive,
particularly against the backdrop of large capital inflows
more recently and weak corporate balance sheets.

Enhance the environment for attracting stable
non-debt creating capital flows, particularly FDI.
Rupee flexibility and monetary policy
tightening. Offer FX swaps to banks to attract
NRI deposits as well as providing dollar
liquidity to oil marketing companies to limit
depreciation.

Protracted period

H

M: Deterioration in the advanced countries’ economic
outlook would cloud the sustainability of the recovery
in India, both for exports and investment.

Structural reform will raise returns to
investment and strengthen domestic sources of
growth.

Heightened
geopolitical risks
in the Middle East

M

M-H: Significant effects on the current account deficit,
inflation and the fiscal deficit.

Further shift toward market pricing to minimize
fiscal impact and improved targeting of
transfers to shelter the most vulnerable.

Financial
imbalances from
protracted period
of low interest
rates continue to
build

M

M: Rapid capital inflows, increased leverage by
corporates especially those with unhedged FX
exposures, and strong currency appreciation pressures
would set the stage for disruptive movements in
macroeconomic and financial variables in the event of
sudden shifts in markets’ expectations.

Further improve the current account deficit
financing mix. Structural reforms, close
monitoring of unhedged FX positions, and
building of external buffers are also key.

Annex II. Public and External Debt Sustainability Analysis1
India’s public debt remains sustainable given manageable interest rate costs and expected recovery in
the economy’s growth rate. 2 Under the baseline, the public debt-to-GDP ratio is forecast to decline
gradually to about 58½ percent of GDP in the medium term from the current level of 65½ percent,
with gross financing needs also declining slightly to about 11 percent of GDP in 2019/20. While the
baseline scenario already uses conservative real GDP growth assumptions, further negative growth
shocks represent one of the major risks to the debt outlook. In addition, realization of contingent
liabilities coming from future bank capital injections and liabilities of the electricity distribution
companies may also push the debt trajectory up to about 70 percent, before the debt-to-GDP ratio
declines gradually in the medium term. On the other hand, the captive domestic investor base is likely
to mitigate the impact of any real interest rate shocks.
1.

India’s public debt sustainability analysis is based on the following assumptions:



Macroeconomic assumptions. Growth is forecast at 5.6 percent (at factor cost) in 2014/15,3
and should gradually return to potential in the medium term (at around 6¾ percent). CPI
inflation is projected to decline from 9½ percent in 2013/14 to around 5½ percent in
2019/20. This baseline scenario assumes continued implementation of structural reforms that
do not require legislative approval, and a relatively benign global economic recovery scenario
as outlined in the WEO.



Fiscal Assumptions. The 2013/14 central government budget deficit came in at 4.5 percent
of GDP (below the authorities’ deficit target of 4.8 percent of GDP), which corresponds to
4.8 percent under the Fund’s definition. Over the medium term, this is expected to decline
slowly toward 3¾ percent of GDP, while state government deficits should decline to
2½ percent of GDP.

1

o

Tax performance, especially for income taxes, is expected to improve slightly as ongoing
administrative measures continue to be implemented and base broadening is expected
to continue. Goods and Services Tax is not assumed in this baseline as it requires
legislative changes, including a constitutional amendment.

o

At the same time, savings are likely to be found from reduced fuel subsidies, including as
a result of deregulation of diesel prices, and the planned gradual introduction of cash
transfers should help rationalize spending over the medium term. However, the Food
Security Act will keep the subsidy bill high.

Prepared by Ran Bi, Mehdi Raissi, and Sonali Jain-Chandra.

2

The analysis of public debt sustainability is based on the framework developed for market access countries. See Staff
Guidance Note for Public Debt Sustainability Analysis in Market Access Countries, IMF, May 2013.
3

The real GDP growth rates presented in the public and external DSA tables are based on market prices, as required
by WEO. However, to be consistent with the authorities’ measure of real GDP, the text here and other macro tables
present real GDP growth at factor cost.

o

Public banks’ capital positions are expected to be enhanced to meet Basel III targets and
some of the debts of electricity distribution companies are to be assumed by the
government.

2.
Under the baseline projection, India’s debt ratio and gross financing needs will remain
on a declining path. India’s primary deficit is projected to trend downward and remain below its
debt-stabilizing threshold (estimated at 2.8 percent of GDP based on the 2019/20 projections) in the
projection years. Therefore, gross financing needs are expected to remain at around 12 percent of
GDP in 2014/15 before gradually declining to around 11 percent in 2019/20. Automatic debt
dynamics arising from the interest rate-growth differential will on average reduce the debt ratio by
some 2½ percentage point per year from 2014/15 to 2019/20. As a result, the public debt-to-GDP
ratio is expected to fall from 65½ percent in 2013/14 to 58½ percent in 2019/20. The medium-term
public debt-to-GDP ratio is about 5 percentage points lower than envisaged in the last Staff Report,
reflecting a downward data revision of the historical public debt path as well as a more buoyant
growth outlook in the near term.
3.
India faces relatively low risks to debt sustainability under the baseline, but it could be
vulnerable to slower real GDP growth and a contingent liability shock. The heat map suggests
that the debt burden benchmark and the gross financing needs threshold are exceeded under a
contingent liability shock. A financial sector contingent liability shock (which could arise from losses
at public banks)4 pushes the debt-to-GDP ratio to about 70 percent in 2015/16. While not flagged as
a main risk by the heat map, a one-standard deviation shock to real GDP growth increases the debtto-GDP ratio to about 66 percent in 2016/17, lower than the threshold of 70 percent above which the
heat map flags the risk. Both shocks, however, do not change the downward debt trajectory in the
medium term. The lack of fiscal adjustment is another principal risk to debt sustainability in India’s
context. An unchanged primary balance would slow debt reduction by about ¼ of one percentage
point per year on average from 2014/15 to 2019/20, but it does not change the downward trend.
Finally, the combined macro-fiscal shock also has a level effect but does not change the direction of
the debt trajectory. As a result, the asymmetric fan chart suggests that upside risks to debt ratio
dominate in the medium term. The debt profile, on the other hand, is at risk to market perception
shocks and external financing requirements. In particular, market perception is flagged as a high risk
as India’s recent sovereign EMBI spreads have breached the threshold of 600 bps. However, these
two risks are mitigated by the fact that most of the public debt is financed through a captive
domestic investor base, the very small external debt is mostly from official creditors, and more than
adequate international reserves are available in the rare case that external financing needs arise.
Risks that could improve India’s public debt sustainability include better tax buoyancy, a GST and a
revised Direct Tax Code that improve efficiency and lead to near-term revenue gains. A strong revival
of the economy could also return India to the debt dynamics prevailing before the global financial
crisis.
4

Due to the lack of data on the actual public bank recapitalization needs, the default shock of 10 percent of total
banking sector assets is used. This contingent liability shock is in addition to the public bank recapitalization assumed
under the baseline to meet Basel III targets.

4.
There is no evidence of a systematic projection bias in the baseline assumptions and
the projected fiscal adjustment is in line with other countries’ experiences. India’s forecast track
record is comparable to that of all other surveillance countries. The median forecast errors for real
GDP growth, primary balance and inflation during 2005–13 are all close to median among all
surveillance countries. India’s projected fiscal adjustment (an improvement of around one
percentage point in cyclically-adjusted primary balance/GDP over the medium term) is modest and
should be achievable. This magnitude of adjustment is also in line with other countries’ experiences,
with a three-year adjustment in cyclically-adjusted primary balance at 37 percentile among all
surveillance countries with market access. Unlike in the last Staff Report, the boom-bust analysis is
not triggered because India had a negative output gap in 2013/14.

Change in gross public sector debt

1/ Public sector is defined as general government.
2/ Based on available data.
3/ Long-term bond spread over U.S. bonds.
4/ Defined as interest payments divided by debt stock (excluding guarantees) at the end of previous year.
5/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;
a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
6/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
7/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as ae(1+r).
8/ Includes asset changes and interest revenues (if any). For projections, includes exchange rate changes during the projection period.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

Exchange Rate Arrangement:
As per the Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions (AREAER), the
exchange rate in India is classified as floating. The exchange rate of the rupee is determined in the
interbank market, where the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) intervenes at times. The RBI’s role is to
modulate excessive volatility so as to maintain orderly conditions. On August 20, 1994, India
accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the IMF Articles of Agreement. India
maintains the following restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current
international transactions, which are subject to Fund approval under Article VIII, Section 2(a):
restrictions related to the nontransferability of balances under the India-Russia debt agreement;
restrictions arising from unsettled balances under inoperative bilateral payments arrangements with
two Eastern European countries; and a restriction on the transfer of amortization payments on loans
by non-resident relatives. The Executive Board has not approved these restrictions.
Article IV Consultation:
The previous Article IV consultation discussions were held in November 2013. The staff report (IMF
Country Report No. 14/57) was discussed by the Executive Board on January 27, 2014.
FSAP Participation and ROSCs:
FSSA/FSAP report was issued in January 2001; a fiscal transparency ROSC was issued in
February 2001 (http://www.imf.org/external/np/rosc/ind/fiscal.htm); the data model of the ROSC
(Country Report No. 04/96) was issued in April 2004. The missions for the FSAP Update took place in
2011, and concluding meetings were held in Delhi and Mumbai in January 2012—the FSSA Update
report was published in January 2013 (Country Report No. 13/8). Detailed assessment reports on
FSAP-related papers were issued in August 2013 and published as Country Reports No. 13/265–268.

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
In Bank FY14 (July 1, 2013–June 30, 2014), IBRD/IDA lending in India totaled US$5.1 billion (of which
US$1.97 billion IBRD and US$3.13 billion IDA). IFC committed US$1.2 billion in FY14. The World Bank
Group’s (WBG) Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for India for 2013-20171 focuses on helping India
accelerate poverty reduction and boost shared prosperity, and is closely aligned the Government’s
12th Five-Year Plan, and its goal of “faster, sustainable, and more inclusive growth.” To make a
meaningful contribution to India’s many development challenges, the volume of WBG support—
from IBRD, IDA, and IFC—should reach $5 billion annually over the five-year period of the CPS.
Under the Strategy, the WBG aims to contribute to India’s development by deepening and
strengthening engagement in three priority areas: integration, rural-urban transformation and
inclusion. “Integration” seeks to increase market integration by focusing on addressing infrastructure
gaps and investment climate as key measures needed to help low-income states converge more
quickly with their faster-growing neighbors. With 600 million people expected to live in India’s cities
by 2031, “rural-urban transformation” will require intensified engagement to improve the
management and livability of medium-sized cities. “Inclusion” will entail a stronger focus on human
development with improvements in healthcare systems and nutrition, on the quality of education at
all levels, as well as on better access to finance and social protection for the underprivileged. A
common theme across these three areas of engagement will be an emphasis on improved
governance, environmental sustainability, and gender equality.
Two key strategic shifts are central to the WBG program and India’s efforts to reduce poverty and
boost shared prosperity—increased support to 14 low-income and special category states2 and to
urbanization. The Bank is working with the Government to rebalance its lending portfolio, so that
30 percent of all IBRD/IDA lending will be directed to these states, which together account for 400
million—one-third of India’s poor people living on less than $1.25 per day. Many of these states also
have human development indicators—high infant mortality, high child malnutrition, low female
literacy—on par with the poorest countries in the world. IFC has also intensified its program in lowincome states. Engagement in more advanced states and at the central level will focus on activities
that are transformative and innovative. Urbanization presents tremendous opportunities, both for
agriculture and poverty reduction, and competitiveness. WBG support focuses on government
efforts at the national, state and city levels to help improve the livability of medium-sized cities.
A robust knowledge portfolio will complement and underpin financing and includes: (i) focus on indepth analytical work on key cross-sectoral questions; (ii) inform design and implementation of
future interventions by drawing on impact evaluations; (iii) respond quickly and flexibly with

Low-income and special category states include: Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha,
Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, and eight northeast states (Assam, Himachal Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram,
Sikkim, and Uttarakhand). IFC also includes West Bengal, but excludes Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand.

demand-driven technical assistance and just-in-time knowledge support to help reform and
implementation; (iv) broker South-South and across-state knowledge exchanges; (v) develop flexible
programmatic approaches to develop analytic and advisory activities; and (vi) scale-up training
capacity.
The 2014 national elections brought in a new Government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi,
and with it opportunities to further strengthen WBG long-standing partnership with India. Stressing
the importance of WBG as the “Knowledge Bank”, Prime Minister Modi has requested more intense
engagement in supporting six strategic priorities: operationalizing the Government’s initiative to
develop 100 “smart cities”; empowering and providing 500+ cities with comprehensive municipal
services and networks; revitalizing the power sector and supporting Government’s 24-7 Power for All
initiative; supporting rural sanitation, with a focus on behavior change-led investments; additional
support for efforts to clean and conserve the Ganga Basin; and skills development to ensure India’s
global competitiveness and inclusive growth.

RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
The Asian Development Bank (AsDB) operations in India began in 1986. Cumulative public sector
loan commitments totaled $29.7 billion as of 30 September 2014 for 180 loans. With an additional
$2.4 billion in private sector loans (the latter without government guarantee), total loan
commitments on a cumulative basis amount to $32.1 billion. These funds have been provided from
AsDB’s ordinary capital resources (OCR). Also, AsDB has approved equity investments amounting to
$0.4 billion. AsDB’s lending and equity activities are summarized below.

AsDB's India Country Partnership Strategy (2013–2017) (CPS) is based on three strategic pillars: (i)
inclusive growth; (ii) environmental sustainability; and (iii) regional cooperation and integration. The
CPS is anchored to AsDB’s Strategy 2020 and has been designed to support the Government of
India’s 12th Five Year Plan (2012–2017) vision of faster, more inclusive, and sustainable growth. The
CPS emphasizes robust infrastructure development, job creation and access to jobs, regional
connectivity, and environmental sustainability. The backbone of the India program will be energy,
transport, and urban services. On a selective basis, ADB will also invest in special purpose vehicles
for infrastructure financing, water resources management, skills development, and state-level fiscal
reforms.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
Macroeconomic statistics are adequate for surveillance, but weaknesses remain in the
timeliness and coverage of certain statistical series. India has an intricate system for compiling
economic and financial statistics and produces a vast quantity of data covering most sectors of the
economy. India subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination Standards (SDDS) on
December 27, 1996 and started posting its metadata on the Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board
on October 30, 1997. It is currently in observance of the SDDS, although it uses flexibility options for
timeliness of data on general government operations and on the periodicity and timeliness of labor
market data.
2.
The data module of the Report on Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC, IMF Country
Report No. 04/96) was published in April 2004. It assesses India’s data dissemination practices against
the SDDS requirements and assesses the quality of six datasets based on the Data Quality Assessment
Framework (DQAF) developed by STA.
3.
National accounts and employment statistics: The Central Statistical Organization (CSO)
releases a new series of national accounts, with base year 2004–2005 with a dissemination lag for
quarterly releases of two months. Large revisions to historical series and major discrepancies between
supply and expenditure national accounts complicate analysis: these differences have become larger
in recent quarters. Supply-side data remain of better quality than expenditure-side data. Estimates of
value added in constant prices for public administration and defense may be biased upwards, as they
are based on the government’s wage bill (with arrears counted in the year that they are paid) deflated
by the Wholesale Price Index (WPI). There are long standing deficiencies in employment data: they are
only available on an annual basis and with a substantial lag, and they only cover the formal sector,
which accounts for a small segment of the labor market. A new series of national accounts with
2011/12 as base year is planned to be released in early 2015.
4.
Price statistics: A revised all-India CPI with new weights was unveiled in early 2011, which
covers combined rural and urban India, with 2009/10 as a base year. As well, separate corresponding
urban and rural CPI series are published. The CPIs are published with a lag of about one month. In
early 2015, the CPI weights were updated using 2011/12 expenditure patterns and the CPI series will
be revised beginning January 2015. Since January 2006, the Labour Bureau has published a CPI for
industrial workers with a 2001 base year. Presently, there also remain four CPIs, each based on the
consumption basket of a narrow category of consumers (namely industrial workers, urban and nonmanual employees, agricultural laborers, and rural laborers).With the exception of the industrial
workers CPI, these other indices are based on weights that are over ten years. The WPI has a 2004/05
base year, for which data are also subject to frequent and large revision, usually upward. New RBI
price series on residential real estate have helped surveillance in this area, though geographic
coverage remains limited, and price data for commercial real estate are not available. The RBI has
started producing a series covering rural wage data, which helps surveillance, but economy-wide
wage data are scant.

External sector statistics: While the concepts and definitions used to compile balance of
payments statistics are broadly in line with the sixth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual
(BPM6). Furthermore, trade data have quality, valuation, timing, and coverage problems, and data on
trade prices, volumes, and composition are not regularly available on a timely basis. Only trade credit
extended for more than 180 days is included in the balance of payments (and the IIP and external
debt data); trade credit is often less than 180 days in most countries. Bilateral data on services exports
to the United States and other developed countries are manifold higher than counterpart services
imports published by these same countries. External debt statistics are available on a quarterly basis
with a one quarter lag. Estimates of short-term external debt are presented in the debt statistics on an
original maturity basis. The short-term maturity attribution on a residual maturity basis is only
available annually (and excludes residual maturity of medium- and long-term nonresident Indian
accounts). The international investment position (IIP) statistics cover the sectors prescribed in the
BPM6 and these data are disseminated within six months of the reference period in respect of annual
data.3 Coverage of direct investment positions data is hampered by the absence of appropriate legal
or institutional authority. India began disseminating the Data Template on International Reserves and
Foreign Currency Liquidity as prescribed under the SDDS in December 2001. The more up-to-date
information on certain variables, such as total foreign reserves, foreign currency assets, gold, and
SDRs, are available on a weekly basis and are disseminated as part of a weekly statistical supplement
on the RBI web site.
6.
Monetary and financial statistics: The RBI web site and the RBI Bulletin publish a wide array
of monetary and financial statistics, including reserve money and its components, RBI’s survey,
monetary survey, liquidity aggregates (outstanding amounts), interest rates, exchange rates, foreign
reserves, and results of government securities auctions. In 2011, the RBI started publishing a weighted
average lending interest rate and other lending rates at annual frequency. The frequency and quality
of data dissemination have improved substantially in recent years.
7.
Concepts and definitions used by the RBI to compile monetary statistics are in broad
conformity with the guidelines provided in the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM).
Nevertheless, the following concepts and principles deviate from the MFSM. First, the resident sector
data do not provide sufficient information on the sectoral distribution of domestic credit. Specifically,
under their present sectorization scheme, the authorities subdivide the resident nonbank sector data
by (i) central government; (ii) state government; and (iii) the commercial sector (including other
financial corporations, public and other nonfinancial corporations, and other resident sectors).
Second, commercial banks add accrued interest to credit and deposit positions on a quarterly basis
only (instead of the prescribed monthly basis).
8.
The RBI reports monetary data for IFS on a regular basis. Since October 2006, the RBI has
initiated the electronic reporting of monetary data, which is a major improvement from the previous

paper-based reporting which was prone to errors and delays. India has also submitted to STA test
data (starting from December 2001 data) on the Standardized Report Forms (SRFs) that have been
developed to implement the methodology outlined in the MFSM. STA is working with the authorities
in resolving the outstanding data issues on the development of the SRFs.
Government finance statistics: The Ministry of Finance (MoF) is responsible for compiling
and disseminating the GFS. India reports the budgetary central government cash flow statement
within one month after the reference month and stock of liabilities within one quarter after the
reference quarter. With the agreement of the authorities, STA uses these data to compile a monthly
cash flow statement for publication in the International Financial Statistics, following the GFSM 2001
presentation, with some missing breakdowns, particularly for expenditure. Data on fiscal performance
at the state level are available only at annual frequency and with a considerable lag. Data on the
functional and economic classification of expenditures are available with considerable lag. There is
also scope to improve the analytical usefulness of the presentation of the fiscal accounts. For example,
classification of government expenditure between developmental/nondevelopmental and
plan/nonplan obscures the economic nature and impact of fiscal actions. The MoF reports central
government data (on a cash basis) for publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook
(GFSY), the latest reported data corresponding to 2010. Two years after the reference year, the
Ministry of Finance reports general government data to STA in the GFSM 1986 format, that staff
reworks to the GFSM 2001 presentation for inclusion in the GFSY (latest reported data correspond to
2008). Data on the general government operations are not internationally comparable as they exclude
data on the operations of the extra-budgetary funds, local governments, and social security funds.
Under the SDDS, India disseminates annual general government data within 3 quarters after the
reference year, using the timeliness flexibility option but meets the SDDS specifications for central
government debt and operations.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
February 13, 2015
This statement contains information that has become available since the staff report was
circulated to the Executive Board. This information does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
1.
Historical GDP figures for 2011/12–2013/14 have been revised. India’s Ministry of
Statistics released (on January 30) a new series for national accounts—revising the base year
from 2004/05 to 2011/12, and incorporating numerous conceptual and methodological
changes consistent with the adoption of the 2008 System of National Accounts. India’s
nominal GDP (at market prices) was marked down by only about 2 and 1 percent in 2011/12
and 2012/13, respectively, while nominal GDP for 2013/14 was essentially unaffected. These
changes would alter only marginally key ratios (including the debt-to-GDP ratio).
Consequently, upward revisions to real GDP growth in 2012/13 and 2013/14 were also made,
raising growth from 4.7 to 5.1 percent and from 5 to 6.9 percent, respectively.
2.
The official forecast of GDP growth for 2014/15 has also been revised. Using the
new GDP at market prices series, the Ministry of Statistics released (on February 9) revised
preliminary estimates of real GDP growth for 2014/15, coming in with an advanced estimate
of 7.4 percent. New quarterly numbers for real GDP growth at market prices (for fiscal year
2014/15) were also released, indicating that growth in the first three quarters of the fiscal
year came in at 6.5, 8.2 and 7.5 percent, respectively. Staff and the economic authorities
(Reserve Bank of India and Ministry of Finance) will be guided by these new high-frequency
numbers, and other series and information on the revised methodology to be released later in
February, in revising 2014/15 and medium-term GDP growth forecasts.
3.
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) kept its policy repo rate unchanged at
7.75 percent on February 3, in line with market expectations. The RBI stated in its latest
bi-monthly monetary policy statement that the rationale for its decision of no change to the
policy rate was the absence of substantial new developments on the disinflationary process or
on the fiscal outlook, since the 25 basis points cut in the policy repo rate of January 15.
4.
The RBI announced a range of regulatory measures in its sixth bi-monthly
monetary policy statement. In its February 3, 2015 statement, the RBI reduced the statutory
liquidity ratio (SLR) of scheduled commercial banks by 50 basis points from 22 percent to
21.5 percent of their net deposit liabilities, increased the limits for foreign exchange
remittances, and increased the minimum residual maturity of foreign portfolio investment in
India to three years. The SLR was, in particular, reduced to provide room to banks to
increase their lending to productive sectors on competitive terms to support investment and
growth.
5.
International reserves have increased due, in part, to continued robust capital
inflows. Net portfolio investment inflows (both equity and debt) have amounted to about US$ 7

2
billion in 2015, of which about US$ 2 billion has occurred thus far in February 2015.
International reserves have increased by about US$ 8 billion during 2015, after increasing by
US$ 27 billion in 2014, and currently stand at about US$ 328 billion (an all-time high)
representing about 6½ months of next year’s imports of goods and services.
6.
The government undertook the largest-ever share sale by any private or public
sector company in India, selling part of its shares in Coal India. During the week ending
January 30, 2015, the government sold 10 percent of its stake in Coal India Limited, the
largest coal miner in the world by output, raising around US$ 3.6 billion from the sale. This
will help the authorities meet their 2014/15 fiscal deficit target of 4.1 percent of GDP.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2015 Article IV Consultation with India
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the Article IV
consultation1 with India on February 13, 2015.
India’s near-term growth outlook has improved, and the balance of risks is now more
favorable, helped by increased political certainty, several positive policy actions, improved
business confidence, and reduced external vulnerabilities. In response to the balance of
payments pressures during the post-May 22, 2013 taper tantrum period, and against the
background of still-limited policy space, the Indian authorities have maintained pro-cyclical
fiscal and monetary policy stances. Consequently, India’s vulnerabilities have receded more
than those of most emerging markets and sentiment has been revived, with growth
rebounding to 5.5 percent in the first half of fiscal year (FY) 2014/15 (ending in March), and
the recovery strengthening gradually. Furthermore, CPI inflation has declined from 9.5
percent in FY 2013/14 to 5 percent in December 2014, reflecting economic slack, a tight
monetary stance, lower global commodity prices, government efforts to contain food
inflation, and favorable base effects. Robust capital inflows in conjunction with the sharp
current account deficit correction (largely due to the contraction in gold imports) have
provided for an increase in international reserves of about $30 billion over the last year,
reaching US$320 billion (representing about 6½ months of import coverage) at endDecember 2014.
Growth is projected at 5.6 percent for FY 2014/15, picking up to 6.3 percent in FY 2015/16
(at factor cost), as a result of the revival in industrial and investment activity. However,
weaknesses in India’s corporate and bank balance sheets will weigh on credit growth, and
fiscal restraint and a tight monetary stance will act as headwinds in the near term, offsetting
the positive growth impact of the improved commodity terms of trade. CPI inflation is
projected to move up to about 6¼ percent by March 2015 and hover slightly above 6 percent
over the course of FY 2015/16, as growth picks up, slack dissipates, and favorable base
effects unwind. The current account deficit is expected to remain contained at around 1¾

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses

percent of GDP in FY 2015/16, helped by significantly lower oil import prices, shrinking
gold imports, and rebounding exports.
Despite the reduction in India’s external imbalances and strengthening of buffers, the
spillover impact from global financial market volatility to India could be very disruptive,
including from any unexpected developments in the course of U.S. monetary policy
normalization, particularly against the backdrop of recent large capital inflows. External risks
also emanate from a prolonged period of weak global growth, which could dampen Indian
exports. Domestic risks include a supply-driven spike in inflation, further deterioration in
bank asset quality and continued stress in corporate financial positions, as well as slowerthan-expected progress in addressing supply-side bottlenecks, which could weigh on growth
and stoke inflation. On the upside, expedited structural reforms and faster implementation of
cleared investment projects could lead to stronger growth, as would sustained low global
energy prices.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors welcomed the authorities’ comprehensive policy initiatives, which have
helped reduce India’s external vulnerabilities and improve the economic outlook. Among
these initiatives are recent policy measures to revive investment, reduce inflation, consolidate
the fiscal position, and improve the ease of doing business. Directors noted, however, that
significant external and domestic risks remain while room for countercyclical
macroeconomic policy support is limited by still-high fiscal deficits and upside risks to
inflation.
Directors considered that the main external risk facing India is a surge in global financial
market volatility. They agreed that, should external pressures re-emerge, rupee flexibility
should continue to be an important shock absorber, complemented by judicious foreign
exchange intervention, tightening of monetary conditions, and additional fiscal adjustment.
Directors welcomed the progress made in reducing inflation, supported by a tight monetary
stance and government efforts to contain food inflation. Nonetheless, Directors noted that, in
light of high inflation expectations and upside risks to inflation, monetary policy should
remain tight to consolidate past gains. Directors concurred that further efforts are needed to
strengthen the monetary policy framework, including a move towards flexible inflation
targeting.
Directors commended the government’s commitment to strengthening the fiscal position

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views

of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any
qualifiers used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

further, and welcomed recent reforms, including the deregulation of diesel prices. They
supported the authorities’ medium-term fiscal targets and encouraged the authorities to
articulate and implement specific supporting measures, which could be used also to enhance
the quality and sustainability of fiscal consolidation. In this regard, fiscal space for higher
growth-enhancing capital spending and social expenditures could be obtained by further
rationalizing fuel, fertilizer, and food subsidies; and raising tax revenues to pre-global
financial crisis levels, in particular by introducing a well-designed goods and services tax and
enhancing tax administration.
Directors noted that India’s international reserves are assessed to be adequate and foreign
exchange intervention should continue to be limited to preventing disruptive movements in
the exchange rate. They emphasized the importance of further improving the external
financing mix by enhancing the environment for attracting stable, non-debt creating capital
flows, particularly foreign direct investment.
Directors stressed that boosting potential growth would require addressing long-standing
supply bottlenecks, especially in the energy, mining, and power sectors, as well as bolstering
the business climate. Directors agreed that further easing of restrictive labor laws, raising the
productivity of the agriculture sector, and addressing skills mismatches would make growth
more inclusive and assist with job creation.
While acknowledging that India’s financial system is well-capitalized and supervised,
Directors noted that deteriorating corporate financial positions and worsening bank asset
quality could weigh on financial sector soundness. They welcomed the RBI’s ongoing
measures to enhance bank supervision and monitoring, and commended the RBI’s efforts to
broaden financial inclusion. Directors encouraged the authorities to further strengthen
prudential regulation for banks’ asset quality classification; address concentration risks;
augment capital buffers; improve corporate governance at public sector banks; and
strengthen the insolvency framework.

Statement by Rakesh Mohan, Executive Director for India
and Janak Raj, Senior Advisor
February 13, 2015
1.
On behalf of our authorities, we would like to thank staff for a well-written,
comprehensive and evenhanded assessment of recent macroeconomic and financial sector
developments in India and the evolving outlook. The report is the outcome of the productive and
candid discussions that the Mission had with our authorities. Our authorities broadly share the
staff’s assessment.
2.
The Indian economy has made a remarkable turnaround since mid-May 2013 when the
‘taper tantrum’ induced turmoil in global financial markets had a significant impact on the Indian
economy. Three main concerns that arose were: a high and rising current account deficit; high
fiscal deficit; and elevated inflation and inflation expectations. Our authorities did not lose time
to take quick, decisive, and well-thought out policy measures to address the emerging
vulnerabilities. As a result, the present situation marks a significant improvement over that which
prevailed in May 2013. India’s current account deficit has declined sharply; inflation and
inflation expectations have moderated significantly; and the fiscal deficit is being contained. Our
authorities continue to pursue the path of fiscal consolidation. Furthermore, various measures
taken by the newly elected government at the Centre have led to a significant improvement in
business confidence.
3.
Even as the macroeconomic situation is improving, some challenges remain to put the
economy on a sustainable high growth path. Investment activity remains weak due to some
segments of the corporate sector being overleveraged along with their related impact on bank
balance sheets. A full-blown recovery of the private sector is thus being restrained. Fiscal
consolidation could also have some impact on the speed of economic activity. Our authorities
are, therefore, trying to strike a fine balance between supporting the recovery and pursuing a
prudent fiscal policy. The new government is pursuing a policy regime that promotes higher
growth and lower inflation, accompanied by a sustained external sector balance.
Recent Macroeconomic Developments
GDP growth and Short-term Outlook
4.
The Indian economy is now clearly on a recovery path. India’s growth recovered to 7.4
per cent in the first three quarters (April-December) of 2014-15 as compared with 7.0 per cent
during the same period of last year. The GDP series has recently been revised by updating the
base year and incorporating several methodological improvements that better capture the
evolving structure of the economy (Annex). Based on the revised series, India’s GDP growth for
2013-14 has been estimated at 6.9 per cent vis-à-vis 5.0 per cent in the old series partly because
of some downward revisions in the previous year. However, the size of the nominal GDP for
2013-14 under the revised series is broadly the same as that under the old series. The Advance
Estimates for 2014-15 have placed India’s GDP growth higher at 7.4 per cent as compared with
6.9 per cent last year, and higher than most current projections.

2
5.
The outlook for the Indian economy beyond the current year has also improved
significantly. Several positive developments such as moderation in inflation, the policy rate cut
by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), real income gains from decline in oil prices and overall
improvement in the business and consumer confidence should further improve the outlook.
Fiscal Policy
6.
India has continued on the path of fiscal consolidation. The GFD of the Central
Government, which was 5.7 per cent of GDP in 2011-12, declined to 4.6 per cent in 2013-14 and
is budgeted to decline further to 4.1 per cent in 2014-15 (these estimates are not materially
affected by the GDP revisions). In order to contain the fiscal deficit on a sustained basis, our
authorities have initiated several measures. First, the government announced deregulation of
diesel prices in October 2014. Second, taking advantage of the falling oil prices, the excise duty
on petroleum products has been raised in stages, and the formula for fixing the price of natural
gas has been revised. Third, the subsidy regime is being overhauled and made more targeted
while providing protection to the vulnerable sections of society; for instance, the cooking gas
subsidy has been replaced by direct transfers on a national basis. Fourth, an Expenditure
Management Commission has also been set up to look into various aspects of expenditure
reforms to be undertaken by the government. The Commission has since submitted its interim
report. However, fiscal consolidation so far has largely been achieved by reduction in
expenditure. The realization of revenues has not fully matched the targets set, though various
measures such as increase in excise duty on petroleum products and expected disinvestment
proceeds are supporting fiscal consolidation.
7.
Our authorities give paramount importance to fiscal prudence not only to improve
immediate macroeconomic fundamentals but also because of the consideration of intergenerational equity.
Inflation and Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
8.
Inflation, which was a major concern for India during 2010-13, has moderated
significantly. CPI inflation, which is now used as the main measure of headline inflation by the
Reserve Bank of India (RBI), declined to 5 per cent in December 2014 from 11.2 per cent in
November 2013. The sharp decline in global commodity prices, especially crude oil, tight
monetary and fiscal policies, and supply side measures, including lower increases in minimum
support prices for major foodgrains, have helped in containing inflation. The Reserve Bank has
indicated that inflation is likely to be around 6 per cent by January 2016. Reflecting softening of
inflation, both near-term and longer-term inflation expectations of households have also
moderated to single digits for the first time since September 2009.
9.
Reflecting the easing of inflationary pressures, the Reserve Bank of India reduced the
policy rate by 25 basis points in January 2015. However, the RBI left the policy rate unchanged
in February 2015. It indicated that further monetary policy measures will depend on
developments on both the disinflationary process and on the fiscal front.

3
10.
India’s current account deficit (CAD) declined sharply from 4.8 per cent of GDP in 201213 to 1.7 per cent in 2013-14 and is expected to decline further to 1.3 per cent in 2014-15.
Improvement in the current account has been underpinned by a sharp decline in gold imports and
in oil prices. Reflecting the improved domestic macroeconomic situation as also the continued
accommodative global monetary conditions, India has received large portfolio flows in the recent
period - much higher than the current account deficit. This has enabled the Reserve Bank of
India to build up its foreign exchange reserves, which are now at US$ 328 billion (as of January
30, 2015), up by US$ 52 billion from the level at end-August 2013. Recognizing the improved
external balance position, the RBI has liberalized outflows for residents. For instance, the limit
on remittances by Indian entities for making overseas direct investment (ODI) under the
automatic route, which was reduced in August 2013 from 400 to 100 per cent of their net worth,
was reversed in July 2014. In early February 2015, the limit of foreign exchange remittance for
individuals was enhanced from US$ 125,000 per person per year to US $ 250,000 as a further
exercise in macro-prudential and capital flow management. This limit is available to individuals
without end-use restrictions, except for prohibited transaction such as lotteries.
11.
The objective of India’s exchange rate policy is to maintain orderly conditions in the
market. The rupee’s exchange rate is determined by market forces of demand and supply. The
Reserve Bank of India intervenes mainly to contain excessive volatility in the market. India’s
foreign exchange intervention strategy is not guided by the need to enhance growth or reduce
inflation in India, as indicated by staff.
Financial Sector
12.
Banks in India remain well capitalized with the CRAR at 12.8 per cent. The capital
adequacy ratio of public sector banks is also comfortable at around 12 per cent and is well above
the regulatory requirement. The government has infused capital of Rs. 586 billion in public
sector banks in the last four years (2011-14) and plans to further infuse an amount of Rs. 112
billion in 2014-15 in order to ensure continued compliance with Basel norms and to provide
ample space for growth commensurate with the overall credit needs of the growing economy. At
the same time, the government is also planning to dilute its stake in some public sectors banks to
52 per cent.
13.
The growth slowdown of recent years has had an impact on banks’ asset quality. High
indebtedness of some corporates has impacted banks' balance sheets. However, there is some
evidence that several of the corporates are on the path of deleveraging and their debt equity ratios
seem to be stabilizing. There has also been renewed focus on speedy regulatory clearances for
projects and their implementations. Once the stalled projects reach the stage of commercial
operations, it will help improve the profitability of the corporate sector, which, in turn, will lead
to an improvement in asset quality of banks. The stress tests by the Reserve Bank in the baseline
scenario of improving the overall macroeconomic situation, as is expected, suggest that the gross
non-performing assets ratio of commercial banks may decline to 4.0 per cent by March 2016
from 4.5 per cent as at end-September 2014.
14.
Although NPLs continue to be at a manageable level, the RBI has also introduced a
framework for revitalizing distressed assets. The framework outlines a corrective action plan that

4
will incentivize an early identification of problem accounts which are considered viable and their
timely restructuring and taking prompt steps for recovery or sale of unviable accounts.
15.
The recent slowdown in credit growth has been on account of a combination of factors
with any risk aversion by banks being only one of several factors. As such with comfortable
capital adequacy ratios, banks should be able to increase the credit flows and support the
recovery. With buoyant secondary markets, banks should also be in a position to raise capital
from the market.
16.
The regulatory regime for NBFCs has been tightened over the years to bring it in broad
alignment with that for commercial banks.
17.
Financial inclusion has been a new thrust area for the new government. To promote
financial inclusion, a new scheme (Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana) was launched in August
2014 to open bank accounts for poor families. It is a unique scheme which embeds features such
as debit card, credit facility and accident and life insurance cover. In a short span of about 6
months, a record number of 126 million bank accounts have been opened as against the target of
100 million. The opening of a large number of accounts should also facilitate direct benefit
transfers to the beneficiaries and improve public expenditure management.
18.
To promote competition, two new private banks were issued licenses in 2014. A
framework has also been put in place for licensing differentiated banks (payment banks and
small finance banks) for serving niche interests. The Reserve Bank of India has received 72
applications for small finance banks and 41 applications for payment banks. The final selection
will be made on the recommendations of the two committees constituted by the RBI for the
purpose.
Structural Reforms
19.
To raise the long-term growth potential of the economy, our authorities have introduced
several structural reforms. FDI limits have been relaxed in several sectors such as railway
infrastructure, construction, defence and insurance sectors. Diesel prices have been deregulated,
which should facilitate new investments in this sector as well as promote efficiency. Gas prices
have been increased and linked transparently and automatically to international prices so as to
provide incentives for greater gas supply and thereby relieving the power sector bottlenecks. The
coal sector has been rationalized through disinvestment of Coal India Ltd (a public sector
enterprise) and reallocation of all the cancelled coal blocks through auction process. Progress has
also been made in the process to initiate legislative action relating to introduction of the goods
and services tax (GST). Some flexibility is also being introduced in labor laws. Several supply
side bottlenecks have also been addressed. Efforts are afoot to skill the youth with an emphasis
on employability and entrepreneurial skills. A pan India program ‘Digital India’ is being planned
to provide broad band connectivity up to the village level, improved access to services through
IT enabled platforms and greater transparency in government processes. The government is also
stepping up efforts to implement a program of disinvestments.
Medium-term Prospects

5

20.
Recent policy initiatives in land acquisition, efforts underway to unlock mining activity,
liberalization of foreign direct investment limits and predictability of the tax regime should help
to improve the investment climate. India has announced a national strategy for ‘Make-in-India’
to boost manufacturing, complete work on industrial corridors, and build 100 smart cities. There
is a proposal to set up 10 coastal economic regions. Several structural constraints and supply
bottlenecks are also being addressed. Project appraisal and approval processes have been
liberalized. All these announcements have led to an improvement in business confidence, which
is reflected in new investment intentions. Several stalled projects cleared are expected to be off
the ground soon. Indian stock markets have outperformed many of its peers. This augurs well for
raising capital from the market to support investment. The moderation in inflation should also
encourage financial savings. It is the endeavor of our authorities to achieve a sustained growth of
8 per cent or above along with macro-economic stabilization in an environment of lower and
stable inflation, fiscal consolidation, a manageable external situation, and continued financial
deepening and development.
Conclusion
21.
The Indian economy is in much better shape now than it was a year ago. External sector
vulnerability has been addressed and it has become much more resilient. Inflation and inflation
expectations have moderated significantly. The fiscal deficit has been contained and the process
of fiscal consolidation continues. The Indian economy is now clearly on a recovery path and is
the only major emerging economy whose growth rate has been revised upwards recently by the
Fund for 2014. The recovery should gather further momentum once the impact of various
measures initiated recently is felt fully. As such India is now also better prepared to deal with
global financial market volatility that could arise in the context of US monetary policy
normalization. As India’s underlying vulnerabilities have receded, there is some room for
countercyclical macroeconomic policies to respond to domestic and external shocks.
22.
The challenge now is to maintain such overall macroeconomic conditions on a sustained
basis so that the Indian economy is able to achieve a high growth of 8 per cent and above over an
extended future timeframe spanning a couple of decades.
Annex1
The Central Statistics Organization (CSO) of India, which compiles data on national accounts,
introduced in January 2015 changes in the compilation of the National Accounts, consistent with
the adoption of the 2008 System of National Accounts, as detailed below:
i)
Headline growth rate will now be measured by GDP at market prices in keeping with
international practice. Although data on GDP at market prices were compiled and disseminated
earlier, it was GDP at factor cost, which was used as a measure of headline growth.

6
ii)
The coverage of the economy under the National Accounts has been improved with more
comprehensive coverage of the corporate sector and different segments in the financial sector
and improved coverage of activities of local bodies and autonomous institutions.
iii)
The base year has been shifted from 2004-05 to 2011-12.
The CSO released data for three years 2011-12 to 2013-14 based on the new 2011-12 series
(Tables 1 and 2). Back data for the earlier years in the new series are expected to be released
later.
