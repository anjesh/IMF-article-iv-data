EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
A cyclical recovery is underway, but its pace is expected to remain moderate, with growth
recovering only to potential in 2005. The fiscal situation remains weak, with the deficit close
to the SGP ceiling despite substantial one-off measures and with the debt ratio continuing to
exceed 100 percent of GDP. Fiscal pressures are likely to rise over the coming years due to
population aging, and the staff views as essential a faster pace of fiscal consolidation than
planned by the authorities. Labor force participation rates have risen steadily over the last
decade, but productivity has been stagnant, underscoring the need for structural reforms to
enhance product market competition and improve the business environment.
Improved external sector performance has contributed to a recovery of output growth, but
medium-term prospects remain a concern. Staff forecasts growth of 1.7 percent in 2005, in
line with consensus forecasts, and below the authorities’ forecast of 2.1 percent. The
authorities agree that risks are on the downside. Labor market reforms have led to a steady
increase in hours worked, but lagging productivity has undermined growth. Potential growth
is estimated at 1¾ percent. Raising it will require measures to further increase the
employment ratio and boost productivity, which has stagnated in recent years.
The fiscal adjustment envisaged by the authorities for 2005 is too small, particularly in
light of limited progress in fiscal consolidation in recent years. Moreover, it is unlikely to
be achieved without further action. Staff and the authorities agreed on the need to eliminate
the deficit, phase-out one-off measures, and reduce the tax burden in the coming years, but
disagreed on the relative priorities. While the authorities saw a case for making progress in
all three areas in 2005, staff argued that deficit-reduction and the elimination of one-off
measures should have assumed priority, primarily because tax cuts would have little impact
if not seen as sustainable. Moreover, there is a significant risk that the fiscal targets will be
overshot in 2005 and the authorities should stand ready to introduce additional measures if
necessary.
A lack of competition in key sectors and problems with the business environment were
recognized as impediments to investment, innovation and growth. Progress was being made
in increasing competition in the energy sector, but in other areas—notably wholesale and
retail trade and professional services—opposition by vested interests had blocked reform.
Efforts were also underway to enhance Italy’s business environment, where lengthy legal
proceedings and the high costs of opening and closing businesses were particularly
problematic. Passage of a modern bankruptcy law has been delayed further.
The financial system was found to be resilient, but passage of “post-Parmalat” reforms to
strengthen securities regulation should be a priority. Banking system profitability is
improving, and the first stage of the FSAP assessment of Italy gave a positive assessment of
financial sector developments. The staff urged Italy to increase its level of official
development assistance, and called on the authorities to continue to resist pressures for
increased trade protection following the elimination of textile export quotas.

Slow growth and unresolved fiscal problems have for years been defining
features of Italy’s economic landscape. Growth has averaged just 1.7 percent over the last
decade. Per capita growth has equaled the euro

and spending ratios are high, and age-related
spending will rise significantly over the coming
decades.
2.
In previous Article IV consultations the authorities and staff had broadly agreed
on the overall strategy to address these problems. In particular, the authorities’ 2001
medium-term program—their first after coming to power—set an ambitious agenda. Sizable
cuts in current spending ratios, in the context of pension and other fiscal reforms, were
expected to move the fiscal accounts into balance by 2003 while still allowing tax pressure to
fall, reducing uncertainty and boosting incentives to invest and work. Together with further
labor market liberalization, privatization, and increased product market competition, fiscal
consolidation would lead to faster growth, giving rise to a virtuous circle. During Article IV
consultations the Fund has strongly supported this agenda.
3.
Unfortunately, policy implementation has fallen well short of targets. The recent
pension reform, which strengthens the reforms introduced since the mid-1990s, is an
important fiscal success. However, in the context

One-off measures, including tax amnesties, have
been repeatedly used to stem the rise of the fiscal

deficit, which has nevertheless approached
3 percent of GDP in 2004. Some further labor

year’s Fund recommendations).
4.
The 2004 Consultation revisited the same themes as previous discussions, but
political realities have led to some adjustment of the authorities’ priorities. In particular,
with general elections scheduled for 2006, delivering on a key electoral promise—cutting
taxes—has become a pressing goal for the government. Thus, a key focus of the 2004

-5-

Box 1. Response to Key Recommendations of the 2003 Article IV Consultation
Fiscal consolidation: During the 2003 Article IV consultation the Fund recommended
reducing the cyclically adjusted (or structural) deficit net of one-off measures by
1 percent of GDP in 2004. The initial budget proposal was close to this target, but the
decline currently projected is only 0.4 percent of GDP.
Pension reform: In August 2004, Parliament approved the “framework law” on the
pension reform, which the Fund had supported. Legislative decrees to implement the
law are expected to be introduced during the next 18 months.
Competition, product market reform, and the business environment: Since last
year’s Article IV consultation little has been done to address the lack of competition in
key sectors or to eliminate bureaucratic hurdles to entrepreneurial activity. Inter alia,
the reform of the bankruptcy law has been once again delayed.
Labor market reforms: In June 2003, the government approved a draft decree
enacting the first part of a “framework law” on employment and the labor market. The
2003 Article IV mission had called for passage of the second half of the reform, but
this has not occurred. The statistical authorities have not completed the work on
regional price indexes, which rendered moot the staff’s proposal that the authorities
take the lead in promoting wage decentralization through regional cost of living
allowances for public servants.

consultation discussions—and an important area of disagreement between authorities and
staff—was the extent to which tax cuts should have priority over fiscal consolidation needs.
II. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
A. Cyclical Outlook
5.
In the first three quarters of 2004 real GDP rose by 1.2 percent over the same
period of 2003, driven by stronger external demand and investment.
•

As exports benefited from the supportive global environment, the external contribution
strengthened over the first three quarters of 2004, turning positive in the third quarter on
a rolling 12-month basis for the first time since end-2001.

-6-

6.
The recovery was expected to take hold
but its pace would likely remain moderate.
Staff projects growth of 1.5 percent in 2004 and
1.7 in 2005, broadly in line with EC and OECD
forecasts. The authorities project faster growth in
2005 (2.1 percent), reflecting a much stronger
forecast for domestic demand growth, arising in
part from positive expectations about the impact
of tax cuts and structural reforms.

After falling in 2003 as some tax incentives
expired, fixed investment recovered, rising by
more than 2 percent in the first three quarters

interest rates and strong increases in house
prices continued to favor construction, while
improving firm balance sheets and the better

Based on results through the third quarter of
2004, staff now expects a positive net external contribution in 2004–05 on the order of
¾ percent. Nevertheless, concerns about Italy’s medium-term external performance
remain (Box 2).

•

Private investment was projected to remain
solid owing to the favorable external
environment, improved firm profit margins as
productivity recovered, and stronger balance
sheets, in the context of supportive monetary
conditions (Box 3), and the rebuilding of
inventories (which had fallen in H1 of 2004).
The unexpected downturn in fixed investment
in the third quarter of 2004 (resulting from a
steep fall in transport and possibly also from
the impact on confidence of concerns about the
sustainabilty of the recovery in Europe),
however, underscores the need for caution.

Box 2. Competitiveness

Underscoring this point, exports of
textiles and leather goods, which in
2003 accounted for almost one-sixth of
exports, fell by about 4 percent in
volume terms during the first half of
2004 compared to the same period of
2003 (also see paragraph 36). In this
context, Italy’s market shares had
performed poorly even vis-à-vis the
other large euro-area countries.

Real exchange rate indicators have
appreciated in recent years. Unit labor
costs rose particularly rapidly,
reflecting poor productivity
performance. The authorities,
however, stressed that Italy’s exports
had also suffered from structural
changes in world trade: global demand
had risen faster for high technology
goods where Italy had little market
weight, while competition from
emerging market manufacturers for
traditional Italian exports had
intensified.

Box 3. Monetary Conditions
Notwithstanding the euro
appreciation, monetary conditions
remained relatively accommodative.
While overall conditions had tightened
fairly steadily since mid-2004, they
were still more or less on a par with
those at the start of the year, helped by
low real interest rates (which were
below those prevailing in Germany, for
example) and were very
accommodative from an historical
perspective.
Bank lending to firms had slowed
somewhat since mid-2003, and was
now growing at a rate close to the euroarea average. Overall, the authorities
stated that the behavior of spreads and
credit lines suggested that the credit
supply had not tightened in the wake of
the Parmalat crisis.

Consumption fundamentals like employment
and real disposable income were holding up
relatively well. Stronger household balance
sheets—reflecting the aforementioned rise in
housing prices—also augured well, though
the third quarter 2004 outturn, which featured
a second consecutive disappointing result,
following a strong first quarter, again points
to the need for caution.

The authorities agreed that risks to growth—mainly oil prices and the exchange
rate—were on the downside. Although Italy’s energy intensity (total primary energy
demand over GDP) was lower than the euro-area average, oil intensity was above average, as
energy was derived almost entirely from fossil fuels. Staff estimates suggest a $6 per barrel
rise in oil prices would lead to an increase in the oil import bill of about 0.3 percent of GDP
and reduce growth by about half that much. A stronger euro would pose additional problems
for Italian exporters, although it would at least attenuate the impact of high oil prices.

With continued moderate wage growth—labor
costs per worker had risen by 2.8 percent in the
private sector year-on-year in Q2 of 2004—and some cyclical recovery in productivity, staff
and authorities agreed that a resurgence of inflation was unlikely.

Growth Trends

Italy’s poor growth performance over the last decade is largely attributable to
total factor productivity developments. The

least transitionally—as firms responded to labor
market reforms by shifting to less capital-intensive production methods and as lowerproductivity workers entered employment, but the scale and duration of the decline in TFP
growth were nonetheless striking, eroding much of the gain from increases in labor over the
last decade. Looking ahead—staff concluded—it was important to address not only the

This is based on the traditional production function approach. A Selected Issues paper
exploring alternative techniques to isolate cyclical fluctuations from underlying trends in real
GDP yields estimates generally consistent with this figure.

11.
Slow growth was generally attributed to
a mix of rigidities and resistance to reform.
There were three main themes:
•

Pan-European aspects. Staff underscored
that, as elsewhere in continental Europe, high
taxation and uncertainty about fiscal
sustainability constrained incentives to
innovate, while remaining labor market
rigidities slowed firms’ responses to structural
changes in production processes. As a result,
and in contrast to more flexible countries,
Europe in general—including Italy—had not
fully realized the benefits of the technological
revolution of the 1990s.

Italy-specific factors. Private sector representatives, academics, and officials pointed to
the small size of Italian firms, and associated limited R&D spending; their concentration
in low value-added sectors (Box 2 above); the historical weakness of the South; and the
faster aging of Italy’s population as factors contributing to slow growth. Staff saw some
of these factors as symptoms of more general labor and product market rigidities, but
recognized that the nature and severity of these deficiencies varied across countries. For
example, Italy’s labor market rigidities consisted of insufficient wage differentiation and
remaining, though reform-reduced, constraints on labor mobility, as well as the high tax
wedge. Product market rigidities (including inadequate competition) in some sectors
were more severe in Italy than elsewhere. Finally, the legal system was particularly slow
and the business climate was generally less favorable than in other advanced economies.

•

Obstacles to reform. As in many countries, opposition from special interests was an
impediment to reform, but the lack of a consensus in favor of change was also notable.
Trade unions and some academics disputed the negative effects of high taxes and public
spending, pointing to the experience of the Nordic countries. Some government
representatives acknowledged that public spending was too high but stressed that this was
a European problem, and alleged little could be cut at the margin without a major
downsizing of the welfare state, a step public opinion would not support. While such
views neglect, for example, the disciplinary aspects of the Nordic welfare states (with
their strict enforcement of training, job search, and other eligibility requirements) and the
steady rise in primary spending in Italy over the past five years, they nonetheless reflect
the fact that a consensus for systemic reforms remains to be achieved.

C. Fiscal Policy
12.
Progress in strengthening public finances
in 2004 was limited, with recent patterns—missed
deficit targets, declining primary surpluses,
extensive reliance on one-off measures, and little
reduction in the debt ratio—persisting. Although a
mid-year corrective package appears to have been
sufficient to keep the deficit below 3 percent of GDP,
2004 was the fourth consecutive year in which the
headline deficit exceeded the original budget target.
Progress was disappointing by a variety of measures:

the 1995–98 average. Thus, Italy has used the
windfall from the drop in the interest burden
that followed euro adoption to raise spending
rather than to accelerate debt reduction.
While one-off measures (real estate sales, tax
amnesties, and one-off taxes)—which have
been used repeatedly in the past to offset
rising primary spending and permanent tax
cuts—likely fell by more than ½ percent of
GDP, they still amounted to almost
1½ percent of GDP.
As the decline in one-offs is not expected to
have been fully offset by permanent
measures, the structural deficit net of one-offs
is estimated to have declined by less than
½ percent of GDP (remaining more than
½ percent of GDP above its 2000 level). The
structural deficit likely actually increased by
¼ percentage point of GDP.
Finally, the decline in the debt ratio is
expected to have again been muted by the
large gap between the public sector
borrowing requirement (net of privatization)
and the SGP deficit, which has averaged more
than 1½ percent of GDP since 1999 (see
paragraph 20).

The 2005 budget targets only modest reductions in the deficit and one-off

The revenue ratio is targeted
to decline by about 0.8 percent of GDP, due both to a decline in the tax ratio and
lower capital revenues (the latter arising from the phasing out of tax amnesties). The
staff estimates the decline in the tax ratio at about 0.3 percent of GDP. The impact of
the tax cut would widen in 2006 by a further 0.2 percent of GDP, and even more if
the “solidarity contribution” of 4 percent that applies to the highest-income tax payers
is eliminated after 2005, as proposed.2
The spending ratio is targeted to fall by about 1 percent of GDP, largely due to the
introduction of a 2 percent cap on the growth of nominal spending (although with
some exclusions, notably on social transfers). Health would be subject to an even
tighter ceiling, but from a base in 2004 that was inflated by payment of wage arrears.
While these cuts are large, they are expected to be achieved primarily by improving
spending efficiency, not by cutting entitlements.

14.
Staff argued that a faster improvement than envisaged in the 2005 budget was
necessary. While understanding the need to set politically realistic goals, staff pointed to the
fact that the fiscal position was still far from that appropriate for a high-debt country (see
paragraph 18), and at the need to make up some of the ground lost through four years of
2

The reform reduces the number of tax brackets from five to three (with a “solidarity
contribution” for the highest income taxpayers that, in effect, establishes a fourth bracket)
and increases exemption levels for some categories of taxpayers. The reform contains
grandfathering provisions ensuring that no taxpayers will be made worse off. The reform also
includes some reduction in the corporate tax burden, although this is estimated at only
0.04 percent of GDP.

- 13 -

missed budget targets. Concerns about the fiscal stance had contributed to Standard and
Poors downgrading Italian debt earlier in 2004. Moreover, with elections due in 2006,
political economy considerations also made 2005 a critical year for fiscal consolidation. Staff
emphasized that tax cuts could stimulate the supply side only if they were pursued in the
context of sufficient progress in fiscal consolidation and therefore seen as sustainable. The
authorities stressed that, the tax cut aside, the contractionary impact of the budget would be
larger than implied by the targeted modest decline in the deficit, as replacing one-off
measures with permanent ones would have a negative impact on demand. Staff concurred,
but underscored that as one-off measures also reduce demand (at least for liquidity
constrained agents), replacing them with permanent ones was not equivalent to introducing
new measures. More generally, given the cyclical upswing, it was time to quicken the pace of
fiscal adjustment.3
15.
Moreover, staff viewed the measures taken as likely to be insufficient—by
0.4 percent of GDP, and possibly more—to achieve the announced deficit target:
•

Using the staff’s lower growth projection, which was in line with consensus
projections, revenues would fall short of the budgeted level by about 0.2 percent of
GDP.
• The budget assumed that the state road agency (ANAS) would be transferred out of
the public sector, taking about 0.2 percent of GDP in investment expenditures offbudget. ANAS continued to receive sizable transfers to cover its operating deficits
(on the order of €0.7 billion annually), which had frustrated previous efforts to
classify it as a commercial entity and move it out of the public sector. For 2005, the
authorities envisaged replacing lump-sum current transfers with “shadow tolls,”
where budget transfers would depend on

At the time of the discussions the authorities envisaged a somewhat stronger adjustment in
the deficit net of one-off measures (some 0.8 percentage point of GDP), which staff had
endorsed, while underscoring the strong risk the fiscal targets would be overshot (paragraph
15). However, part of the targeted improvement was lost when the budget was amended in
December to include the tax cut of 0.4 percent of GDP, financed largely through one-off
measures.

quantify, related to the effectiveness of the still-untested constraints on spending by regional
and local governments, particularly as they were not supported by major cuts in entitlements.
Risks were highest for health spending, which had been fully devolved to subnational
governments and where past efforts to control expenditure had failed. Staff regretted that
more could not be done to contain net spending, including by increasing user fees, cutting
transfers to enterprises, and through steps to contain the public sector wage bill, which has
grown significantly in recent years due to increases in wages in excess of those in the private
sector and in employment.4
16.
The authorities believed the risks to the budget outturn were manageable and
did not take up the staff’s call for additional measures of about ½ percent of GDP. First,
they regarded their revenue projections as conservative, creating some margin in case of
slower growth. Second, they felt their proposed treatment of ANAS would be accepted, and
stressed that ANAS’s new commercial orientation reflected not only changes in financing
arrangements but also an increased emphasis on cost containment. Third, though
acknowledging that regional and local government spending (especially on health) was an
area of risk, they believed new controls—including the ability to nominate a receiver to
direct overspending regional governments—would prevent overruns. Staff urged the rapid
implementation, in case of need, of the tools to ensure compliance, noting that in the past
these had been limited or ineffective. More generally, staff called for prompt action to offset
any slippage during budget implementation. The authorities indicated their willingness to
introduce measures if needed to ensure compliance with the SGP ceiling.
17.
Turning to the medium term, the new pension reform was a significant step
towards easing demographic pressures, but age-related expenditures would still rise
substantially. The reform would raise the effective retirement age starting in 2008, with an
important effect on medium-term spending trends (Box 4). This would build on the
considerable reforms implemented since the mid-1990s. Nevertheless, population aging was
expected to increase annual pension spending by about 2 percent of GDP over the coming
decades. Annual health spending would also rise, by some 3 percent of GDP according to
(conservative) staff estimates.

4

The budget does introduce a freeze on hiring for the public sector, but the impact on
expenditure will be backloaded, with only a small effect in 2005. Moreover, some sectors are
exempted from the freeze.

- 15 -

Box 4. Pension Reform
In August 2004, Parliament approved a framework law offering temporary fiscal
incentives to delay retirement and, from 2008, raising the effective retirement age. The
reform also furthers the development of a fully-funded private pension system by
allowing workers to opt out of the mandatory severance/retirement payment scheme
(TFR) and instead direct their contributions to retirement funds, including occupational
funds.
The statutory retirement age is 65 for men, but those who have contributed to the
system for 35 years are eligible for retirement at 57. In 2008, this minimum age will
rise to 60 (61 for the self-employed), with one additional year added in 2010 and 2014.
Women with 35 years of contributions would continue to be eligible to retire at 57, but
with reduced benefits. Men and women with at least 40 years of contributions will
remain able to retire at any age.
For 2004–07, workers who have met the requirements for retiring at age 57 but opt to
defer retirement would pocket (free of income taxes) the corresponding employer’s and
employee’s social security contributions, raising their incomes by about one third. The
authorities have prudently estimated that the step would not result in significant
savings, with lower pension outlays for workers induced to retire later broadly offset
by the costs of foregone contributions from workers who would have deferred
retirement anyway. Early data, however, suggested some net saving may arise.
According to the authorities, the long-term financial savings from the reform would
peak at about 0.7 percent of GDP by the middle of the 2010s, but would decline
gradually to zero by 2040, becoming moderately negative thereafter as longer working
lives lead to an increase in average pensions.

18.
Given these pressures, staff saw a need for a rigorous application of the pension
reform and for an accelerated pace of fiscal consolidation. Specifically, the authorities
should (i) fully implement the pension reform measures already legislated (including issuing
the implementation decrees for the 2004 reform and updating pension replacement rates in
line with life expectancy developments every decade, as required by the 1995 reform); and
(ii) move to a small fiscal surplus in the coming years, with no one-off measures. Achieving a
small surplus by 2009 would imply average annual reductions in the structural deficit net of
one-offs of at least ¾ percent of GDP over the next five years, an adjustment pace that did

- 16 -

not seem too demanding for a high debt country. This together with the major privatization
efforts envisaged by the government, would over time allow the debt ratio to decline and
then stabilize at below 50 percent (Box 5).5
19.
However, in contrast to previous years, the medium term targets laid out in the
current budget do not contain a commitment

In addition to Box 5, the standard debt sustainability template was applied (Table 6). The
baseline scenario in the template assumes no change in policies, and thus features a larger
deficit (and debt ratio) than the baseline scenario in the Box. The template highlights the
sensitivity of the debt ratio to interest rates (although their volatility has likely dropped after
euro adoption).

- 17 -

Box 5. Fiscal Sustainability
Staff’s baseline projection uses, possibly somewhat optimistically given Italy’s history
of fiscal consolidation, the adjustment path envisaged in the 2005 budget and,
thereafter, keeps revenue and non-age-related spending ratios to GDP constant. Health
and pension spending reflect the latest ISTAT demographic projections and the
pension reforms introduced since the mid-1990s, including in mid-2004. The baseline
assumption on health spending (like the authorities’) links age-adjusted per capita
consumption of health services to growth of GDP per capita. This may underestimate
health spending, as health spending has risen faster than GDP in recent years. Labor
productivity growth is assumed to rise gradually to 1½ percent annually (from
0.8 percent on average over the last 10 years). The scenario also assumes further gains
in the employment ratio (by 5 percentage points over 20 years). These assumptions are
more conservative than those in official projections and together result in long-run
annual growth of about 1 percent. Along with the application of the provisions of the
pension reforms of the last few years, they result in a significant decline in the
replacement ratio over the coming decades, which could be difficult to sustain as the
share of retirees in the voting population rises.
Under the assumptions above, the fiscal deficit would decline through 2010 but rise
thereafter, due to increased age-related spending and, later, interest payments. The debt
ratio would bottom out in 2025 at about 65 percent and increase thereafter.
The adjustment scenario features spending cuts sufficient to achieve a small surplus in
2009. Thereafter, taxes and non aging-related spending are held constant as a percent
of GDP. Savings on the interest bill allow financing the increase in aging-related
spending, with the debt ratio falling to 45 percent by 2035 and then stabilizing.
Stress test scenarios include: (i) slower long-term productivity growth (1¼ percent),
which even in the adjustment scenario leads to a rising debt ratio in the long term; (ii)
slower population growth (using Eurostat projections, with lower immigration rates),
which again leads to upward-trending debt dynamics even in the adjustment scenario;
(iii) lack of structural fiscal adjustment over the next four years, leading to a debt/GDP
ratio above 200 percent; (iv) a more optimistic productivity growth scenario based on
the authorities’ assumptions, under which the debt stock falls to 20 percent of GDP by
2050; and (v) failure to implement scheduled adjustments in pension replacement rates
in line with life expectancy developments. These results underscore the importance of
reforms to increase potential growth and of early action to address fiscal problems, as
well as the need for close monitoring given the wide margin of uncertainty.

20.
Staff also called for increased fiscal transparency. One key issue—raised in
previous Article IV consultations and recently the subject of a report from the European
Commission—was the persistent gap between the SGP-deficit and the borrowing
requirement. Efforts had been made to clarify the sources of the discrepancy between the
two, but the process was still difficult, and there was no clear economic explanation why
some accounting items had grown since 1998 (Box 6). The authorities did not believe that
the gap involved any systematic measurement bias. Instead, given the focus of the SGP on
the deficit, it was to be expected that operations affecting the borrowing requirement but not
the deficit (e.g. accumulation of financial assets, and transfers that were classified below the
line under ESA95) would rise more rapidly. Be this as it may, understanding the behavior of
the borrowing requirement was critical for assessing debt sustainability, and the need for
increased transparency in this area was recognized. The need for full transparency in the
activities of the institutions promoting public-private partnerships for investment was also
agreed. Over the coming years, Infrastrutture S.p.A. was expected to finance a growing
share of infrastructure spending, which would fall outside the SGP deficit definition. It was
essential to provide a clear accounting and economic assessment of any contingent liabilities
from its operations.
21.
The authorities’ debt reduction strategy features a substantial increase in
privatization, although some proposed transactions could pressure future budgets.
Receipts of €100 billion (1.7 percent of cumulative GDP) from below-the-line transactions
were planned for 2005-08, starting with about €30 billion (2.1 percent of GDP) in 2005.
These figures included sales of equity in state-owned enterprises, the disposal (and possible
lease-back) of real estate, securitization of income streams, and other transactions. In
addition, the authorities planned above-the-line revenues of €7 billion in 2005, including
from the sale of part of the road network: the buyer would be compensated with annual
budgetary transfers in lieu of toll payments. The authorities assessed the total value of public
sector assets at well above 100 percent of GDP. However, a significant share was controlled
by subnational governments, and privatization efforts would therefore depend not only on
market conditions but also on the commitment of local and regional governments to reduce
the debt burden. Staff noted that some of the proposed transactions—such as sale-leasebacks
of real estate and the securitization of income streams—would, like the sale of part of the
road network, reduce the debt ratio but increase spending or reduce revenues in the future.

- 20 -

Box 6. Gap Between the Fiscal Deficit and the Borrowing Requirement
Over the period 1999–2003 the annual cash-based borrowing requirement net of
privatization receipts (PSBR) exceeded the accrual-based SGP deficit by over 1½ percent of
GDP on average. The size of this gap has exacerbated the lingering controversy over
consistency of Italy’s debt and deficit figures, including a possible underestimation of the
latter. Subsequently to the mission, the EC questioned some technical elements of the
authorities’ SGP deficit calculation, citing the lack of transparency in reconciling the two
measures.
The gap broadly reflects differences in three areas: (i) financial transactions affecting the
PSBR but not the SGP deficit; (ii) sources of information, with the PSBR compiled by the
Bank of Italy differing from that derived from government agencies; and (iii) timing,
recording, and valuation rules between cash and accrual accounting.

While financial transactions accounted for a large part of the discrepancy over 1994–2003,
cash versus accrual accounting explains most of the 1 percent of GDP increase in the gap
since 1998. Although it was unusual that differences between cash and accrual accounting
persistently went in the direction of higher cash deficits, the authorities attributed this to a
series of ad hoc factors whose importance varied from year to year: (i) refunds of direct and
indirect taxes had accelerated in recent years; (ii) there had been payments of health
spending arrears; and (iii) the 2003 tax amnesty lowered the deficit that year, while some
cash payments were also delayed to 2004. A persistent delay in the payment of social
security contributions of about 0.2 percent of GDP annually—which the authorities argued
could be structural—also contributed to the gap.
The authorities provided the mission with clarifications and data on some of the above
issues, particularly on taxes and the flows attributed to health spending. At the same time,
they noted that regional devolution and some institutional changes (e.g., in the area of
pensions) had made the task of adhering to the ESA95 guidelines very time-consuming, and
made “economic” analysis of these discrepancies ever more difficult. Comprehensive health
sector data suffered from substantial weaknesses, thereby hindering precise deficit
accounting of past debts, but a study group was working to address the issue. Another such
group had been created to examine the methodology for social security contributions, in
view of the persistent delay in payments.

- 21 -

22.
Progress in implementing constitutionally-mandated fiscal devolution has been
slow. A constitutional reform approved in late 2001 assigned legislative responsibilities
across government levels, but designing an implementing framework had proven difficult.6
Domestic political concerns are by necessity always central to the choice of frameworks, but
staff noted that international experience provided some guidance. Specifically, successful
implementation depended on transparency and stability of rules and regulations, soundness
of monitoring mechanisms, and credibility of enforcement. Improving incentives for
compliance would require strengthening coordination of monitoring and enforcement. This
would also help ensure ownership of the reform across the political spectrum. The
introduction of a pilot program to create a standardized reporting system for cash
transactions of government units (SIOPE), to be implemented in 2005, was a step in the right
direction, although further efforts to unify accounting standards were needed.
D. Labor and Product Market Reforms

dividends. Liberalization of part-time and fixedItaly: Total Hours Worked, 1990-2002

Nevertheless, the employment ratio remained the lowest in the euro area, and
regional disparities in unemployment rates, while falling, were still substantial. The
authorities agreed that imbalances in unemployment rates could be reduced by greater
decentralization of wage bargaining to allow incomes to reflect more closely regional
differences in productivity and costs of living. Progress, however, was dependent on the
social partners, as there were no legal or regulatory barriers to such arrangements.
Employers’ representatives indicated their broad support for greater wage differentiation, but

Recent changes to the employment survey to bring it in line with EU norms have resulted in

The authorities saw the narrowing of regional disparities in per capita incomes
and unemployment rates as a validation of their strategy to promote growth in the
South. The adoption of this strategy, which focuses on enhancing the efficiency of
infrastructure investment (including through greater transparency and accountability) and
capacity-building at the local government level, had coincided with a narrowing of the per
capita income gap between the South and the Center-North, even as regional disparities in
other EU members had widened. The rate of new enterprise creation in the South had also
outstripped that in the rest of the country over the last several years. Staff welcomed these
results, but noted that the improvement remained limited (with South/Center-North relative
per capita income rising from about 56 percent in 1995 to 60 percent in 2003). Moreover,
employment growth had largely stalled in the South since late 2002, before recovering in the
second quarter of 2004 (though unemployment had continued to fall). FDI remained minimal
in the South.

Efforts were ongoing to increase competition, though with greater success in the
energy sector than elsewhere. Another sizable portion of the electricity company ENEL had
been sold in the world’s largest privatization in the last two years, and the government was
encouraging greater private investment in generation. Prospects for progress in retail trade
(among other services) were limited, however, as local governments had so far ignored
central government encouragement to liberalize. Although the anti-trust authority had
achieved some recent successes, there were concerns about the adequacy of its enforcement

powers: little could be done to punish professional associations11 and—as in much of
continental Europe—the authority could not impose criminal penalties.
28.
Recent studies have confirmed problems with Italy’s business environment, with
negative consequences for investment and growth. Data compiled by the World Bank
showed that the time required to complete the legal processes involved in enforcing contracts
is seven times the average for the rest of the euro area.12 In addition, the costs of opening and
closing a business are well-above

World Economic Forum’s Global
Competitiveness Report ranked Italy forty-seventh in the world in terms of the support its
business environment gives to growth. Staff noted that the low level of FDI in Italy was also
indicative of problems with the business environment. As with competition, Italy’s business
environment was likely to discourage not only investment but also innovation, firm size
expansion, and the entry of new and more efficient firms, thus hampering productivity
growth.
29.
The authorities recognized the shortcomings of the business environment—
especially in the South and regarding contract enforcement—but questioned whether
investor surveys fully captured the effects of past reforms. For example, the time needed
to open a business had recently been reduced from 22 weeks to 6, while the associated
financial costs (though still high by industrial country standards) had fallen by two-thirds
over the last several years. The authorities were also reducing red tape, and a large number of
“useless” codes had already been phased out. Efforts were ongoing, as well, to address the
slowness of the legal system. For example, 12 new corporate tribunals had recently been
created. In addition, the authorities were at work on a long-delayed reform of the bankruptcy
law. The new law would create a process similar to Chapter 11 in the United States,
accelerate firm closure, and—by strengthening lenders’ rights—stimulate the flow of credit
to small- and medium-sized firms. Staff encouraged the prompt approval of the law, which
the authorities had in previous consultations regarded as imminent.
11

The inability to penalize professional associations arises from the fact that fines are based
on turnover, which for most associations is negligible.

(including the legal system) and economic performance.

E. Financial Sector
30.
The banking system has evolved substantially in the last 15 years, resulting in
greater competition. The number of banks had fallen by one-third since 1990 due to
consolidation, but the number of branches had increased by some 80 percent. In addition, the
banking system was now essentially private, while new firms had entered the leasing,
factoring and consumer credit markets.

Indicators of profitability and
vulnerability were improving. Return on equity
was expected to rebound to close to 10 percent
for the system and to 11 percent for the six largest
banking groups. The capital-adequacy ratio,
about 11 percent in mid-2004, remained
comfortably above the Basel minimum. However,
despite a significant improvement in loan quality
in recent years, NPL levels remained relatively
high.

Market participants expected some restatement of balance sheets with the
transition to International Financial Reporting Standards in 2005. Banks may need to
write down the value of nonperforming loans, and some banks were therefore already
seeking capital injections. The impact of the introduction of Basel II on bank capital and
profits was uncertain, as capital requirements would fall for good clients and rise for bad
ones. In principle, the new capital standards could induce banks to reduce lending to smaller
enterprises, but some very small firms would qualify for treatment as households under the
new rules and thus be subject to more favorable accounting treatment.
33.
Private sector representatives welcomed the stimulus to private retirement
savings the recent pension reform would provide. They agreed the scheme had the
potential to increase private saving and accelerate the development of financial instruments
to manage longevity and related risks, but expected that at least initially few workers would
opt to participate in private plans (other than union-managed occupational funds). The

- 26 -

reform would lead to small increases in costs for firms that had until now been using TRF
contributions as a form of inexpensive internal financing. It was expected that the public
sector would compensate them for these costs, although the 2005 budget contained no
provision to do so.
34.
The authorities had responded to the Parmalat and Cirio scandals by preparing
a draft law on savings, but passage had been delayed by political disagreements over
some of its provisions. The authorities had therefore sought to fast-track some elements of
the law—those aimed at enhancing the powers of CONSOB (the securities regulator)—by
including them in separate legislation incorporating the EU market abuse directive. A
number of amendments have been proposed to the remaining elements of the draft savings
law—which include the transfer of insurance industry regulation to the Bank of Italy and of
responsibility for banking system competition from the Bank to the anti-trust authority—and
its timing and final content therefore remained uncertain. Ex post analysis of the Parmalat
and Cirio cases suggested that financial intermediaries had sometimes marketed products
without ensuring that customers had full information on their risk profiles, and the need to
ensure observance of requirements in this area was recognized.
35.
The first of two FSAP missions was completed in early November and gave a
positive assessment of financial sector developments.13 It found that standards of market
regulation and supervision in Italy are comparable with those of other G7 countries; that
compliance of securities regulation with the IMF’s transparency code is high; and that the
securities settlement and clearing systems are safe, sound and efficient. While the mission
identified some weaknesses in CONSOB—including a lack of financial resources,
insufficient independence from the Ministry of Finance in imposing penalties, and limitations
on the sanctions that it can impose—these would be addressed by the draft law on market
abuse (see paragraph 34).14 However, the draft legislation contains no provisions
guaranteeing representation of minority shareholders in all listed companies’ corporate
boards or requiring a majority of independent directors, two measures that, the mission
noted, could strengthen corporate governance standards. The second FSAP mission is
scheduled for late summer 2005.

supported the recent revision of the EU’s Common Agricultural Policy for so-called
Mediterranean products, but looked forward to some rebalancing of the treatment of
Mediterranean and Continental products. They were in the process of developing a program
with the EC to monitor the effects on Italian firms of the elimination of export quotas under
the Multi-Fiber Agreement. Despite anxiety among firms about competition from low-cost
producers, the authorities stated that they would resist demands for protection and for
implementing safeguard clauses until data from the system could be evaluated. As in the
past, they expressed a desire to strengthen protection for intellectual property rights. They
hoped detailed modalities for the Doha Round of trade negotiations could be agreed at the
next ministerial meeting in December 2005.
37.
Official development assistance rose in 2004—to 0.22 percent of GDP, compared
to 0.19 percent in 2003—but remains low. The authorities intend to increase ODA to
0.33 percent of GDP by 2006, in line with EU commitments. They were also supporting the
UK-sponsored initiative to create an International Finance Facility to increase development
assistance.
38.
In February the authorities issued a decree implementing the Second European
Directive on Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism. They are
participating in working groups on a third decree that would implement some additional
recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force, and they are preparing a law to freeze
nonfinancial assets of persons related to terrorist groups.
39.
Only limited progress has been made in addressing statistical issues raised in the
2002 ROSC data module report (Appendix II). Important steps had been taken to
strengthen price collection and raise response rates on enterprise surveys, however (see
paragraph 20 for a discussion of fiscal data issues).
III. STAFF APPRAISAL
40.
Despite improving near-term prospects, Italy’s medium-term outlook remains
weak, absent a credible commitment to fiscal consolidation and to significant further
reforms. The fiscal windfall that accompanied euro adoption was used to finance higher
current spending, with the deficit now near the Maastricht ceiling—despite substantial oneoff measures—and limited progress in lowering public debt. Deficit targets have been missed
for four consecutive years, and targets going forward have been revised downward. Fiscal
pressures are set to grow as population aging increases spending for health and pensions. The
2004 pension reform has improved the outlook, but much work remains to ensure long-term
fiscal solvency. Moreover, deep-seated rigidities in product and labor markets, and the poor
business environment, have stifled investment and innovation, and, despite progress, retarded
employment growth.
41.
To ensure fiscal sustainability, the budget needs to move to a small surplus over
the coming years. The authorities’ assurances that they continue to view overall balance as
an appropriate medium-term target are welcome, but this pledge should be accompanied by a

- 28 -

specific timetable. Achieving a small surplus by 2009 while eliminating one-off measures
would broadly strike the right balance between the need to make up for past delays and
avoiding an excessively abrupt correction. The most recent set of pension reforms is a
welcome step toward improving medium-term fiscal prospects. Enacting the legislation
necessary to implement the reform during 2005, and application in 2005 of the first of the
required adjustments to pension replacement rates in line with changes in life expectancy,
would further reduce uncertainty about fiscal sustainability.
42.
The fiscal adjustment envisioned in the 2005 budget falls short of what is needed,
in part due to the decision to finance the tax cut largely through one-off measures.
Moreover, the budget targets are unlikely to be achieved without further action. In this
light, additional spending cuts should have been adopted, or the tax cuts deferred. Reductions
in the tax wedge are important to support medium-term growth, but benefits will be realized
only if the cuts are seen as lasting, which requires a sustainable and predictable fiscal
environment. The authorities should therefore now be prepared to adopt structural measures
in 2005 to at least ensure the target is met. However, should growth be slower than the
consensus estimate of 1.7 percent, the automatic stabilizers should be allowed to operate.
43.
While stronger spending cuts would have been warranted, the focus of the
budget on reducing the ratio of primary current spending to GDP is welcome. Any
additional measures in 2005 should also target current spending. To maximize the
effectiveness of the newly-introduced uniform cap on spending growth for most items, it
should be incorporated into a system of multiyear spending reviews to develop and protect
budget priorities. In some cases—such as health care—it will also need to be accompanied
by changes in entitlements if spending overruns are to be avoided. The proposed increase in
privatization receipts over the coming years could improve economic efficiency by putting
government assets to more productive use. However, transactions such as the securitization
of future income flows, the sale and lease-back of buildings, and the sale of part of the road
network will have negative implications for future budgets. The merit of these operations is
unclear, and should be assessed transparently.
44.
Fiscal transparency needs to improve. The large gap between deficits and
borrowing requirements should be explored further, focusing on its economic causes. The
operations of public entities outside the general government, notably Infrastrutture S.p.A.,
will also have to be monitored transparently, now that their activities are becoming sizable.
45.
Reforms to accelerate Italy’s growth potential are also critical to addressing
fiscal weaknesses. Without a sustained increase in growth, the budget consolidation process
will be much harder to manage. The strategy should focus on measures to further reduce
labor market rigidities and unlock stagnant productivity.
46.
The improvement in the labor market over the last decade shows that structural
reforms do yield results, and need to be continued. The employment ratio is still low, and
regional and demographic disparities in unemployment rates remain large. While only the
social partners can agree to decentralize the wage bargaining process to allow a better

- 29 -

alignment of wages with local productivity and costs of living, the government can help start
the process by basing public sector wage increases in part on developments in regional price
indexes, once they are available. In addition, the second stage of the Biagi Reform—which
will help further reduce labor market rigidities—should be approved.
47.
Product market reforms now need to be tackled with the same resolve shown on
labor markets. Additional regulatory reform and further privatization in key network
industries like energy can reduce costs and increase competitiveness economy-wide.
Strengthening the powers of the anti-trust authority should also be considered. Reforms are
particularly needed to address shortcomings in the business environment, which ranks among
the least growth-friendly in the OECD. As a first step, the reform of bankruptcy legislation
should not be further delayed. Measures are also urgently needed to accelerate other legal
processes and further reduce red tape. Progress in this area could contribute to faster
reductions in regional income differences, as problems with the business environment are
particularly acute in the South. In addition, product market reforms could give additional
impetus to labor market reforms, especially where progress is dependent on social partners.
48.
Bank profitability is improving, and financial sector supervision is generally
strong, but passage of the post-Parmalat reforms should be a priority. The draft law on
market abuse appropriately gives CONSOB more resources, strengthens its ability to
exercise key functions independently, and enhances the sanctions that can be imposed on
wrongdoing. Beyond the measures contained in the pending market abuse directive,
consideration could also be given to mandating that corporate boards contain a majority of
independent directors and to stipulating that they include a representative of minority
shareholders.
49.
The authorities should continue to resist pressures for increased trade
protection. They should address worries about the impact on domestic producers of the
expiration of textile quotas, as well as their concerns about protecting intellectual property
rights, through existing multilateral and regional institutions. Italy’s commitment to raise its
relatively low ODA is welcome.
50.
Economic statistics have remained broadly adequate for surveillance. However,
in addition to the necessary improvements in fiscal data noted in paragraph 44, faster
progress towards addressing the shortcomings noted in the ROSC data module would be
welcome.
51.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard
12-month cycle.

APPENDIX II

Italy: Statistical Information
Italy’s economic database is comprehensive and of generally high quality. Italy has
subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) and has posted the metadata
for the Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB). Data are provided to the Fund in a
comprehensive manner (see attached table), and the authorities regularly publish a full range
of economic and financial data, as well as a calendar of dates for the main statistical releases.
Italy is also subject to the statistical requirements and timeliness and reporting standards of
Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB), and has adopted the European System of
Accounts 1995 (ESA95).
A Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC)—Data Module (Country
Report No. 02/234, 10/18/02) found Italy’s macroeconomic statistics to be of generally high
quality, but also identified some shortcomings that hindered an accurate and timely analysis
of economic and financial developments: (i) no statistical agency had the responsibility to
compile and disseminate an integrated, comprehensive statement of government finances,
and a troubling difference had emerged between the several distinct measures of government
deficit/financing; (ii) source data and/or statistical techniques could be strengthened in
several areas, most importantly, by raising response rates on the enterprise surveys used in
the national accounts and producer price index, by making price collection for the consumer
price index more efficient, and by improving the coverage of cross-border financial
transactions that did not go through domestic banks; (iii) balance of payments and
government finance statistics could come closer to the internationally accepted
methodological guidelines on concepts and definitions, scope, classification and
sectorization, and/or valuation; and (iv) resources were under pressure in some parts of the
National Institute of Statistics in the face of the statistical requirements of the European
Union and the euro area. The ROSC also noted the persistently large gap between the SGPmonitored fiscal deficit and the PSBR net of privatization receipts, a topic that is discussed in
detail in the Staff Report (Box 6 and paragraph 20).
Recent steps to improve economic data include: work on the way by ISTAT to calculate
regional price levels—expected to be available in 2005; the publication of quarterly data for
the general government balance, expenditure, and revenue on an accruals basis (that is, in
line with ESA95) starting in October 2003; and a new, more detailed labor survey, conducted
by professional staff (see footnote 7). The shift to chain-weighted indices for national
accounts is expected in March 2005.
Notwithstanding these improvements, weaknesses remain in some areas. In the national
accounts, inventory accumulation is derived as a residual and lumped together with the
statistical discrepancy: this hampers an analysis of the business cycle. Furthermore, as
highlighted by a recent fiscal transparency ROSC mission, the quality and timeliness of some
fiscal data, particularly on expenditure by local governments, falls short of the SDDS
requirements, notwithstanding some improvements of late.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
February 7, 2005
1.
This statement provides information that has become available since the
issuance of the Staff Report. The new information does not change the thrust of the staff
appraisal.
2.
Recent short-term indicators underscore the downside risks to the recovery.
Industrial production fell by a larger-than expected 0.7 percent in November (month-onmonth), with production of all categories of goods weakening. Consumer confidence posted
its third consecutive monthly decline in January, although the Business Climate Index
improved on the strength of rising orders and falling inventories. In addition, a number of
forecasters have reduced their 2005 growth projections, with the consensus forecast standing
at 1.5 percent in January, slightly below the Staff Report’s projection of 1.7 percent and the
budget’s projection of 2.1 percent. (The staff projection may, however, be subject to revision
in the upcoming WEO round). Harmonized consumer prices rose 2.1 percent year-on-year in
January, according to preliminary estimates.
3.
On February 2 the European Commission published its assessment of the Italian
authorities’ 2004 Stability Program Update, raising concerns about fiscal policy. The
Commission found that additional measures could be required to keep the fiscal deficit below
3 percent of GDP this year, due to downside risks to the macroeconomic scenario and to
uncertainties about budget implementation. The Commission therefore called on the
authorities to take additional measures as necessary to ensure achievement of the 2005 deficit
target. In addition, while finding (in contrast to staff) that with full implementation of the
budgetary targets and the recent pension reform the debt would be sustainable, the
Commission noted the existence of risks to sustainability and thus (in line with staff advice)
called for additional consolidation efforts so as to bring the budget “close to balance” by
2008. It also called for close attention to “factors other than net borrowing which contribute
to the change in debt levels.”

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Concludes 2004 Article IV Consultation with Italy
On February 7, 2005, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Italy.1
Background
A cyclical recovery is underway, with real GDP having risen by 1.2 percent in the first three
quarters of 2004 relative to the same period of the previous year, thanks to the favorable
external environment and a recovery of investment. Staff forecasts growth of 1.5 percent in
2004 and 1.7 percent in 2005, the latter broadly in line with consensus forecasts but below the
official projection of 2.1 percent. Despite the increase in international oil prices in 2004, price
pressures are expected to remain moderate, with inflation averaging only about 2¼ percent this
year.
A package of corrective measures adopted in mid-2004 is likely to have proven sufficient to
keep the fiscal deficit just below 3 percent of GDP last year. Nevertheless, significant reliance
on one-off measures and the large gap between the Stability and Growth Pact deficit and the
public sector borrowing requirement (net of privatization receipts) remain sources of concern.
The 2005 budget targets a small reduction in the headline deficit, to 2.7 percent of GDP, based
in part on new measures to control expenditure growth. The budget includes a personal income
tax cut of about ½ percent of GDP.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

-2Labor market reforms and wage moderation have led to a substantial increase in hours worked
in recent years, although the employment ratio remains the lowest in the euro area. Stagnant
productivity, however, has offset much of the growth impact of improved labor market
performance. In this respect, a lack of competition in key sectors and problems with the
business environment are widely recognized as impediments to investment, innovation, and
growth. Progress has been made in increasing competition in the energy sector, but advances
in other areas, and in improving the business environment more generally, have been more
limited.
Banking system developments in 2004 were generally positive, with profitability and vulnerability
indicators improving. Following the high-profile bankruptcy of Parmalat in December 2003, the
authorities introduced a draft law to strengthen securities regulation, but passage of the law has
been delayed. In response, the authorities have incorporated some key elements of the reform
strengthening the powers and resources of Consob (the securities regulator) in the area of
investor protection into a draft law implementing the EU’s market abuse directive, which is also
under consideration by Parliament.
Executive Board Assessment
Italy’s short-term economic prospects are improving, based on a rebound in investment and
exports, while inflation remains moderate. However, the economic recovery is likely to be
modest, and there are downside risks stemming from high oil prices and the appreciation of the
euro. More broadly, Italy’s growth potential remains constrained by long-standing supply-side
weaknesses and continuing uncertainty over fiscal prospects. Against this background,
Directors considered that a key challenge facing Italy is to enhance its growth potential by
securing durable fiscal consolidation and pressing ahead with further structural reforms to
enhance competition and strengthen the business environment. Progress in these areas will
require determined efforts to shape a supportive national consensus.
Directors underlined the importance of a strong and credible medium-term fiscal strategy based
on durable adjustment measures to ensure the long-term sustainability of the fiscal accounts.
In view of the high public debt burden, they felt that the objective of achieving a small structural
fiscal surplus before the end of the decade still remains appropriate, and regretted that the
authorities’ economic plans had dropped a previous explicit commitment to this effect. They
commended the implementation of the pension reform, and called on the authorities to move
quickly to finalize supporting legislation and adjust pension replacement rates in line with
increases in life expectancy.
While acknowledging that Italy has been able to keep its fiscal deficit below the Stability and
Growth Pact’s ceiling, Directors noted that this was in large part due to significant reliance on
one-off measures. Looking forward, they noted that the fiscal adjustment envisioned in the 2005
budget—with a small decline in the overall deficit and a limited decline in one-off measures—
again falls short of what is needed. Moreover, there are risks that the deficit target might be
missed in the absence of further action. Directors called on the authorities to be prepared to
adopt structural measures over the course of 2005 to ensure that the target is met.

-3While recognizing the need for reductions in the tax burden over the medium term, Directors
believed that the tax cut implemented this year should have been tied to additional structural
expenditure cuts or delayed. They also cautioned that fiscal decentralization will need to be
accompanied by strengthened coordination among government units, the adoption of
transparent and stable rules, and strict monitoring of compliance with these rules in order to
avoid a loosening of the fiscal stance.
Directors underscored the need to continue improving the structure of the public finances, and
welcomed the government’s commitment to eliminate one-off measures by 2006. Given Italy’s
high tax ratio, Directors emphasized that any additional adjustment should focus on current
spending, and welcomed the newly-introduced uniform cap on spending growth as consistent
with this objective. They noted that incorporating these spending limits into a system of multiyear spending reviews could help develop and protect budget priorities. Directors supported the
authorities’ plans to step up privatization efforts. At the same time, they stressed that
transactions such as securitization of future income flows, sales and lease-backs of assets, and
the sale of parts of the road network might well have negative implications for future budgets
and would therefore need to be assessed carefully.
Directors observed that fiscal transparency needs to be improved. The decline in the public debt
ratio in recent years has been muted by the large gap between the fiscal deficit and the public
sector borrowing requirement net of privatization receipts. They welcomed recent initiatives to
clarify the sources of this discrepancy, but underscored the urgency of strengthening these
efforts with a view to focusing on the economic causes of the persistently larger borrowing
requirement.
Directors were encouraged by the positive results from labor market reforms, including
increases in the employment rate and in hours worked. However, the employment ratio is still
low, while regional and demographic disparities in unemployment rates remain large. Directors
therefore recommended approval of the second stage of the “Biagi” labor market reform bill,
which would further reduce rigidities. They also encouraged the social partners to agree to
greater decentralization of the wage bargaining process and increased wage flexibility, with
some Directors observing that the authorities could contribute to this goal by accelerating the
construction of regional cost-of-living indexes and anchoring public sector wage increases to
them. Some Directors noted that the implications of wage decentralization for fiscal federalism
would need to be taken into consideration. Also, labor market reforms should be accompanied
by increased efforts to enhance the quality of the labor force through training and education.
Directors stressed the need to raise Italy’s low productivity growth, including through greater
competition in product markets and enhancement of the business environment, noting that
deep-seated rigidities are hampering competition and impeding innovation, investment, and
efficiency. While commending some progress made in the energy sector, Directors called on the
authorities to promote competition more forcefully through regulatory reforms, and to address
shortcomings in the business environment, including through measures to accelerate legal
procedures and to eliminate red tape. In particular, they emphasized the importance of enacting
the long-delayed reform of the bankruptcy law.

-4Directors welcomed the continuing positive trends in Italy’s financial sector, as indicated by the
first round of the Financial Sector Assessment Program. They noted the increase in bank
profitability, which has contributed to improvements in financial vulnerability indicators. A few
Directors cautioned, however, that despite substantial progress, non-performing loans remain
relatively high, partly reflecting the length of recovery procedures. While observing that financial
sector supervision is generally strong, Directors recommended prompt passage of reforms
designed to enhance the powers of the securities market regulator. They noted the importance
of strengthening corporate governance standards, and welcomed the forthcoming introduction
of a legislative package that will address this issue. Directors looked forward to the results of the
next round of the Financial Sector Assessment Program.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to increase overseas development assistance
to 0.33 percent of GDP by 2006, and encouraged faster progress toward meeting the United
Nations’ target of 0.7 percent of GNP. Directors encouraged the authorities to continue to resist
pressures for increased trade protection, and to monitor the domestic impact of the expiration of
textile export quotas.
Directors noted that Italy’s statistics are adequate for surveillance. They nevertheless
underscored the need to address remaining weaknesses, some of which were identified in the
2002 Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes, and to clarify the reasons for the
persistent discrepancy between the fiscal deficit and the borrowing requirement net of
privatization revenues.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by Pier Carlo Padoan, Executive Director for Italy
February 7, 2005

Italy is a high-debt/low-growth country deeply embedded in a low growth region. In such a
demanding environment, where room for maneuver is limited and trade-offs are tight, Italian
authorities remain fully committed to pursue fiscal consolidation and structural reforms so as
to raise the country’s growth potential. Higher, sustained, growth will critically contribute,
together with fiscal consolidation, to a sustained reduction of debt.
A number of structural reforms1 have been introduced over the recent past which are
beginning to bear fruits.
A pension reform was introduced in 2004. Developments in the labor market are positive
mainly due to the implementation of the first segment of the Biagi reform, which is building
on previous reforms. A comprehensive reform of the school system is under way and
showing positive results. Steps have been taken to stimulate R&D and an institute was
created (Italian Institute of Technology) with a mandate to stimulate research and scientific
competition. Several measures have been taken to foster entrepreneurship and to improve the
business environment, such as the introduction of a new corporate income tax system and
improved access to finance for business, as well as simplification in the judicial procedures
for company litigation.
In spite of significant results, notably in labor markets, which have led to a substantial
increase in employment, growth remains low. As the staff report notes this is largely the
result of the disappointing development of TFP. The evolution of TFP can be interpreted in a
number of ways. One possible interpretation is that reforms in other areas are needed to
complement those already in place before fruits in terms of growth of the reform strategy can
be fully reaped. Of course, as elsewhere, this requires time, political capital to overcome
resistance to reform, and the need to face short-term costs.
Pension reform
As stressed by the EU Commission2, the 2004 July reform goes in the right direction and is in
line with the BEPG recommendations for 2003-2005, which require Italy to reduce the longterm transition period to the new contribution-based system. Its implementation starts in
2008, when the tightening of eligibility criteria is scheduled to take effect. These additional
measures will produce substantial savings. The introduction of more stringent measures only
in 2008, aimed at addressing long-term sustainability, will not lead to early retirements. The
entitlements will remain unchanged for workers that will mature their rights to a seniority

Commission.

-2pension before January 2008. According to the information available so far, there have been
no changes in the projected retirement requests. In the transition phase incentives to increase
retirement age will be budget-neutral.
As discussed below, DSA taking into account the 2004 pension reform shows that the debt to
GDP ratio declines steadily over the period 2005-2050.
Labor market reforms
Phase one of the Biagi reform is still to be fully implemented. Hence further results should be
expected, especially once the employment agency system is fully operational. The second
phase covers the reorganization of employment incentives, the reform of the social shock
absorber (mainly, the enlargement of the ordinary unemployment benefits), the suspension of
Article 18 of the Labor Rights Law, and arbitration in individual labor disputes3. The bill is
under discussion in Parliament, and not yet scheduled for the final vote. One major obstacle
to its approval is the contentious issue of the experimental suspension of Article 18. Another
obstacle is the cost of the reform of the unemployment benefits, which is expected to have a
substantial impact on the budget (because of the lengthening of the benefit duration and the
increase in its level).
The additional flexibility provided by the Biagi Law already in place might further reduce the
cost of labor, providing additional incentive to increase the labor-capital ratio. However
additional labor market flexibility in the existing labor pool is not the key problem. The main
challenge is to increase participation which is, nonetheless, on the rise. The employment rate
is at the low end of EU levels but its growth rate in 1998-03 is among the highest in Europe
(4.1 percent versus 1.7 percent in EU 25)4. The low participation rate is largely the result of
low women and elderly participation5. However, the rate of growth of women's employment
is above the EU average. It increased by 6 percentage points between 1995 and 2003.
Pension reforms have increased the participation rate of over 55 by more than 2 percentage
points between 2001 and 2003.

Empirical evidence suggests that the impact of Article 18 on firm size growth is small.

Italy” Bank of Italy, Temi di Discussione, No. 504.

In 2003 the male participation rate of the 25-54 age cohort is 91.5 percent (EU-15 average
is 92.4 percent).

-3Product market reforms are potentially more important but more difficult to
implement.6
A number of draft laws are in Parliament for the reform of professional services. Main
common features include: measures to simplify recognition of new professions; setting
minimum and maximum fees only for professional activities bearing on the general interest;
possibility for new professions to advertise and inform the general public; improvement in
pre-professional training. The “simplification law”, to be approved in 2005, will liberalize
business activities at all relevant steps. The “decree on competitiveness”, shortly to be
presented by the government, will further slim down red tape for business.
The Energy Sector. Supply and demand.
The diversification of supply should lower electricity costs (10000 MW of combined cycle
gas turbine power plants are foreseen for the next 3-4 years). At regional and local levels
obtaining authorization for new power plants is difficult mainly due to low public
acceptance. The law 55/2003, will introduce a top/down process and compensation
mechanisms for populations living close to the power plant, and should speed the
authorization procedures.
The merger between the company which holds the electricity network (Terna) and the grid
management company (GRTN) to be completed in 2005, and the privatization of the
resulting company, will be a further step to liberalize the sector.
In order to facilitate entry of new companies and promote further competition the Energy
Authority has recently established rules aimed at: reducing market power and preventing
increases in wholesale market prices due to strategic behavior; making existing rules
consistent with the planned unification of ownership and management of the transmission
grid; and harmonizing the several existing rule sets.
Two decrees aimed at reducing consumption and enhancing energy efficiency were approved
in July 2004 and the market has been further opened to all non-domestic consumers,
consistently with the EU directive. Starting in January 2005 all non-domestic consumers can
buy electricity on the wholesale market.

6

As a forthcoming IMF Working Paper shows, while a piecemeal approach to reforms is
possible in labor markets, it is usually not possible in product markets. Product markets have
to be liberalized in one shot to avoid the formation of dominant positions. See T. Boeri
‘Reforming Labor and Product Markets: Some Lessons from Two Decades of Experiments in
Europe’, 2005.

-4Improving the judicial environment for business
We welcome the selected issues paper, which is in many ways “path breaking” and we
encourage staff to apply the same approach to other country cases. We also share the general
conclusion that improvement in the “judicial system” could significantly boost growth. A
costly and inefficient enforcement system may generate barriers to entry, reducing
competition; it might negatively affect the possibility of firms to access financial markets; it
may indirectly influence the average size of firms. The excessive length and costs of the
Italian bankruptcy procedures also have a negative effect on the turnover of economic
activity and hence the re-allocation of resources.
A draft law on bankruptcy reform is under discussion in Parliament, following a major
redesign (maxiemendamento) approved by the Government in late December 2004. The draft
law significantly simplifies the existing procedures.
The operation of the judicial system has been streamlined and updated in 2003 through the
introduction of judicial offices specialized in industrial and property rights related to
litigation. A special procedure for company litigation was introduced in 2004 to speed up
trials. Available evidence shows that, as a result, time needed to settle controversies in these
matters has been significantly reduced.
With respect to the analysis by staff we point out the following aspects.
Cross country correlations between quality indicators and GDP do not help to assess whether
there is a causal link from institutions to growth; the regressions on “institutions and growth”
where past growth rates (1985-2003) are regressed on current institutional variables are
conceptually ambiguous. They are run on the very strong assumption that no relevant
changes have occurred in the institutional variables included over the 18-year period. The
“long term stability” of some institutional factors should be somehow documented.
The analysis of the determinants of judicial inefficiency as well as the suggested measures
take into consideration only the demand-side. They do not fully reflect the breadth of the
current debate in Italy on the causes of inefficiencies and on possible reforms. These include
supply side issues such us procedural rules and internal organization of courts.
Competitiveness and productive specialization. Escaping path-dependency.
As widely recognized one of the underlying causes of low growth is the persistence of
Italy’s specialization pattern which is exposed to major shifts in world demand and supply
possibly more than in other large industrial countries. Long lasting rigidities make it more
difficult to reallocate resources towards new, more dynamic, sectors. However, recent studies
highlight the relationship between increased international competition and an increase in
productivity of exporting sectors beginning in the nineties7. Increased labor market
7

See M. Bugamelli and A. Rosolia, “Produttivita’ e concorrenza estera”, Bank of Italy, 2004.

-5flexibility, as generated by labor market reforms, is useful in this respect. At the same time it
could, paradoxically, make the situation worse to the extent that more labor market flexibility
favors deepening specialization in the traditional sectors (path dependency) rather than
reallocation in new sectors/products, where higher human capital intensity is necessary.
Some improvement can be detected however. While Italy’s export market shares in volume
terms have declined since 2001, market shares at current prices remained broadly constant (at
about 4 percent of world exports), reflecting a higher average unit value of Italian exports.
This might signal a quality upgrade in the composition of Italian exports. Exporters of lower
quality goods might have suffered from competition from emerging markets while those
exporting higher quality goods have kept (or increased) their shares on foreign markets8. My
authorities firmly believe that increasing international competition in lower quality segments
should not be countered through more protection.
Sustained growth in the South would be a major factor in boosting potential output...
In the context of the recent weak economic activity, the Southern regions have shown a
remarkable performance vis-à-vis the Center-North, with the GDP over the last eight years
recording on average a higher rate of growth—a result which holds also on per capita terms.
It is the first time in the whole post-war period that this occurs.
Growth in the South of Italy since the mid-1990s has been driven by increasing fixed gross
investment vis-à-vis the Center-North. Reversing a trend observed in the recent decades, it is
the first time since the Sixties that capital accumulation in the South of Italy exhibits a
favorable dynamic in comparison to the Center-North.
This performance has been underpinned by a steady increase in the share of public
investment out of total capital expenditures. Decisions taken by CIPE (Inter-Ministerial
Committee for Economic Planning) in 2003 and 2004 are expected to strengthen this trend by
providing further resources available for public investment.
…would wage differentiation help?
As staff reiterates, growth and employment in the South could be further boosted by wage
differentiation. While we share this general suggestion we would add a number of caveats.
Wage differentials between North and South have been on the rise since the early 1990s.
There are different opinions on how to achieve a wider regional wage differentiation (which
is for social partners to implement). On the one hand, a two-tier system such as the current
one might work, while controlling the overall wage growth. On the other hand, a fully
decentralized system might be more efficient in setting wages closer to the regional

internazionale – Rapporto ICE 2003-2004”.

-6equilibrium level. However, such a system might bring about stronger pay rises in the North,
potentially hampering competitiveness.
Staff strongly argues in favor of the public sector “leading by example” in setting wages at
different levels in different regions. My authorities believe that the implications for fiscal
federalism of such a policy should be carefully spelled out before this proposal is
implemented.

Debt and growth
Lower growth over the past few years largely accounts for the slow pace in debt reduction.
To assess the effect of this slowdown on the debt dynamics, a simple simulation has been
carried out for the period 2001-2004, assuming growth at potential (based on Commission
estimates9) and all other variables unchanged, including the stock-flow adjustment, SFA.
Higher growth affects the debt-to-GDP ratio through: i) a smaller numerator, given a smaller
nominal deficit for a given cyclically-adjusted balance, ii) a higher denominator, given higher
GDP growth. As shown in the figure, in the alternative scenario (dotted line), with growth at
potential, the debt-to-GDP ratio would have fallen by 0.3 percentage points more than the
9

Potential growth calculations are based on actual data for 2001-03 (1.9 percent in 2001, 1.7
percent in 2002 and 1.5 percent in 2003 and 2004), and are thus a lower bound estimate.

-7historical level in 2001, 2 percent more in 2002, 1.8 percent more in 2003 and 0.9 percent
more in 2004. In 2003 the debt-to-GDP ratio would have been at 102.1 percent, 4.1
percentage points lower than in the baseline, and at 100.8 in 2004, 5 percentage points lower
than the baseline. The average reduction in the debt to GDP ratio in 2001-04 would have
been 2.6 percent, against a 2.3 percent average for 1994-2000.
Debt sustainability analysis
We welcome the DSA analysis. Results presented by staff go a long way towards the
standard this chair has always advocated for DSA, including the assessment of the impact of
structural reforms. We take it as a compliment from staff that the analysis has been
specifically applied to Italy. We expect this approach to be extended to other surveillance
exercises.
All the same we do not agree with staff on the underlying hypotheses, which are overly
pessimistic. Staff assumes: 1) labor productivity will raise gradually to 1.5 percent annually;
2) limited gains in the participation rate (5 percentage points over 20 years); 3) long-run
annual growth of about 1 percent.
In our view staff do not adequately take into account the interactions between demographic
trends and labor productivity which typically would take place over such a long time horizon:
the marked decline in active population will have a positive effect on productivity through
the wage mechanism (also given more flexible labor markets) and the adoption of capitalintensive technologies, while the reduced average number of children per family will
increase private and public resources available for human capital accumulation.
Staff underestimate gains in the participation rate, which is historically lower in Italy with
respect to the EU average, but that—as mentioned above—has shown an upward trend in the
last decade (a one percentage point increase per year), especially as a consequence of the
higher female activity rate in the new cohorts.
Italy’s Stability Program for 2005 consistently assumes labor productivity growth stable and
slightly below 2 percent; participation rate gains by 11 percentage points over the period
2003-2050; and a GDP growth rate above 2 percent between 2005 and 2010 and declining to
about 1 percent in the following years.
The 2005 Stability Program sustainability analysis, taking into account the effects of the
2004 pension reform, shows that the debt to GDP ratio declines steadily over the period
2005-2050, drops to below 60 percent in 2018, and turns into a credit in 2042.
According to staff, ageing population is expected to increase Italy’s public spending by about
5 percent of GDP in the coming decades. We reject this conjecture: the Ageing Working
Group of the EU Economic Policy Committee in its 2003 final report projects that the ageing
population will increase public spending by 1.4 percent of GDP between 2005 and 2050
taking into account 4 components (pensions, health care, education and unemployment

-8benefits). The report stresses that the increase for other EU-15 countries will be much higher,
in the range of 3-7 percentage points of GDP in the same period.
Missing targets
The staff report stresses that fiscal targets were missed for four consecutive years. We have
assessed the growth impact on fiscal targets in the last four years to see if and to what extent
these targets have been missed. To do so we use the methodology, based on the production
function10, that the Commission and EU Member States regularly use to carry on the
sensitivity analysis to be included in Stability and Growth Programs as required by the
related code of conduct (EFC/ECFIN/404/01).
Initial fiscal targets and growth projections are those included in the updated Stability and
Growth program presented to the EU Council in year t-1, which is based on the medium-term
financial framework (Documento di Programmazione Economica e Finanziaria, DPEF)
approved by the Parliament in July of each fiscal year. Outcomes are those reported in the
updated Stability and Growth program presented to the EU Council in year t+1, as the final
data for the deficit are formally communicated to EUROSTAT on March 1 of the year
following the one to which the target deficit is referred. We should keep in mind that over the
last couple of years growth projections were revised downward, at least every 6 months, by
all international institutions, while budget targets were set assuming growth projections
available at the time when the medium-term financial and economic programs were
presented to Parliament.
The table below shows the fiscal targets adjusted for growth changes, as well as the
difference between the original deficit targets adjusted for the cycle and the final outcomes
for the years 2001-04 and its average (-0.4). Growth changes have significantly affected
deficit targets. The amount of the difference (the “miss”) has been decreasing over time,
positive in 2003, and expected to be close to zero in 2004.

-9Stock Flow Adjustment
In the period 1994-2003 the average cumulative value of SFAs for EU countries is 4.2
percent of GDP. At 3.3 percent, Italy stands well below the EU average. As for the period
2000-2003, Italy’s cumulative SFAs is 0.3 percent of GDP, the third smallest value among
the EU-15, well below both the EU-15 and EU-25 averages (1.8 and 1.7, respectively)11.
When the SFAs are broken down by component – accumulation of financial assets, valuation
effects, and cash-accrual differences – in the period 2000-2003 the average values of the first
two components for Italy are negligible. A significant value (1.2 percent of GDP) is instead
present for the cash-accrual difference in the recording of revenue and primary expenditure.
However, this is largely compensated by the another cash-accrual difference, related to
interest payments, which goes in the opposite direction (-0.6 percent of GDP) so that the total
of the cash-accrual difference, the third component of the SFAs, stands at 0.5 percent of GDP
on average for the period 2000-2003.
Net borrowing and borrowing requirement
A table with the components of the gap between net borrowing and borrowing requirement is
reported in Box 6. The Box and the table need some clarifications. They could specify that
the borrowing requirement published by the Ministry of Economy and Finance is calculated
on the formation side with reference to the Public Sector, while the borrowing requirement
published by the Bank of Italy is computed on the financing side with reference to the
general government sector. The table could better refer to the sources and methods used to
compute the reported figures. In particular it could clarify whether the public sector
borrowing requirement series used in the calculations includes the revisions on the postoffice accounts which took place in 2004. In this regard, it should be noted that the series
regularly published by the Bank of Italy includes such revisions (as well as the usual ordinary
statistical revisions), while the Ministry does not publish a complete time series of the
borrowing requirement (the Relazione Trimestrale di Cassa reports only the most recent
years). We are actively working to reduce these discrepancies and an ad-hoc committee was
established to this purpose.
Privatizations will continue
Items for privatization will include possible additional ENEL tranches, Alitalia, and the state
broadcasting company RAI. “Second level” privatizations will include Terna and Wind by
ENEL and SNAM by ENI. The program will also include other assets in addition to equity
shares, such as real estate and securitization operations.

(ECFIN/2004).

- 10 S&P Downgrading
Other credit rating agencies did not follow S&P's decision. Actually Moody's reiterated its
stable outlook and did not raise any concerns with respect to Italy's budget position. In
addition, after that decision, credit spreads on Italian government bonds showed substantial
resilience. As investors continued to show robust appetite for Italian bonds, Italy's credit
spread continued to improve.
Fiscal adjustment
The Italian authorities continue to be committed to fiscal consolidation. The Minister of the
Economy has recently reiterated the commitment to maintain the deficit below the 3 percent
limit in 2005.
As staff also recognizes, the composition of adjustment goes in the right direction as one-off
measures are being reduced. A 2 percent cap has been imposed on nominal spending with the
exclusion of pensions. The positive effects of this measure have already materialized in 2004
outturns as a direct consequence of the law decree of July 2004 (“decreto taglia spese”). In
the third quarter of 2004, the general government consumption declined by 4.4 percent. In
addition, preliminary data on the 2004 budget shows that the trend of some items are
outperforming budget forecast, in particular interest expenditures declined and lottery
revenue increased.
As for health spending, further controls on spending procedures by regions have been
introduced in the 2005 financial bill including:
a) regions and public health institutions are obliged to define their budgets in line with
central government fiscal objectives.
b) throughout the year, if the expenditure profile is not in line with that originally planned,
the regions are obliged, according to a strict timeframe included in the aforementioned law,
to take additional measures to bring the trend back to its projected path. If the region is
reluctant to do so, the central Government can oblige the Governor of the region to take
urgently the required measures.
c) the latest revision of the domestic stability pact introduced stricter rules for local
authorities to monitor expenditure developments. All local entities, with some differences
based on the population size, have to report quarterly to the Ministry of Economy cash and
accrual accounts. In the case of overruns, the local government is required to reduce
payments in the following quarter. In the case of non-compliance, the following year the
local government is not allowed: a) to exceed the previous year's expenditures, b) to recruit
new staff, and c) to increase debt.

- 11 Tax relief
The Italian government has set as a priority the adoption of tax relief measures, as a way to
boost the economy also through a boost to confidence. Tax relief measures included in the
2005 budget, will have an impact on the revenue side of 4261 million euro in 2005, 7186
million for 2006, and 6564 million for 2007. The measures will be fully financed through
cuts in expenditures (about 80 percent in 2005, about 50 percent in 2006 and 2007) and
increase in revenues, including duties, due to the positive impact of tax relief on disposable
income (about 20 percent in 2005 and 50 percent in 2006 and 2007). Even though the share
of expenditure cuts tends to decrease in 2006 and 2007, the overall financing is ensured by
structural measures.
ANAS
The ANAS Company was privatized in November 2002. However, according to the
European accounting rules (ESA 95), to classify the company as a full commercial entity,
the operational costs should be progressively financed through market revenues. This target
is expected to be reached by the end of 2005, following which ANAS will be considered by
EUROSTAT as a full commercial entity and no longer considered part of the public sector.
Infrastrutture Spa
Infrastrutture Spa is a financial intermediary owned by the Cassa Depositi e Prestiti. It has
been designed taking into account the positive experience of similar institutions that have
served the same purposes in several other large EU member countries. Its main mission is to
co-finance PPP infrastructure projects, including those identified by the European Growth
Pact endorsed by the European Council on December 2003.
So far, the activities carried out by Infrastrutture Spa have been limited, also due to the
delays in implementing the European Growth Pact, in particular its quick-start list of
projects. Being a full commercial company, the company follows the related accounting and
reporting standard procedures.
Banking sector
As recognized by the staff, the efficiency of the Italian banking sector, now completely
privatized, has improved substantially in the last decade: competition has increased, and the
cost-income ratio has declined, allowing banks to maintain interest rates in line or below the
average of the other EU countries. The six major banks have a ROE of about 13 percent (11
percent for the whole system, in June 2004). The Italian banking sector is one of the most
open for foreign shareholders: in the four major Italian banks the share of capital held by
foreign banks as members of shareholder agreements is 19.6 percent, well above major Euro
area and Anglo-American banks (statistics based on IBCA data). Regarding the impact of
Basel II, the empirical analysis (conducted at the international level and by the Italian
authorities) shows that the new regime should not have distortional effects on the credit
conditions of different classes of companies, including SMEs.

- 12 Corporate Governance
As recognized by staff, the Italian legal, regulatory and institutional framework is, overall,
adequate. Staff’s assessment of the Consob’s insufficient independence from the Minister of
Finance in imposing penalties is imprecise, since the Minister of Finance has only to check
the formal legitimacy of the sanctions. In some areas Italy has one of the most advanced
regulations: for instance, that regarding financial reporting and disclosure is one of the most
rigorous in Europe; the rotation of the external auditors is compulsory; the recent reform of
the Company Law (L.D. 6/2003), in addition to the Italian model (based on the dual system the Board of Directors and the independent Board of Statutory Auditors), offers companies
the possibility to choose between the Anglo-American unitary board and the German
“supervisory board”. The Preda Code requires an adequate number of independent NonExecutive Directors on the basis of the “comply or explain” rule, as in other European
countries.
Very shortly, possibly by the end of February, a legislative package (the “Law on Saving”
and the implementation of the Market Abuse Directive), will provide a strong answer to the
recent corporate governance problems. The major provisions are: a) for listed companies that
at least one member of the Board of Directors should be elected by the minority
shareholders; a provision that will put Italy in a leading position on this issue; b) Consob staff
should increase substantially, as well as its enforcement power through higher sanctions in
cases of misbehavior; c) new measures, once approved, should further reinforce the
procedures aimed at reducing potential conflicts of interest within the financial industry.
Fiscal federalism
Fiscal decentralization is ongoing. It is concentrated on constraints on the spending side
while there is little change on the revenue side.
