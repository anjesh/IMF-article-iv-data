IMF Executive Board Concludes 2017 Article IV Consultation with India
On January 25, 2017, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation1 with India.
The Indian economy has recorded strong growth in recent years, helped by a large terms of trade
gain, positive policy actions including implementation of key structural reforms, a return to
normal monsoon rainfall, and reduced external vulnerabilities. Inflation has remained low after
the collapse in global commodity prices, a range of supply-side measures, and a relatively tight
monetary stance. Fiscal consolidation at the Union government level resumed in FY2016/17, and
has been complemented by measures to enhance the quality of public spending. External
vulnerabilities are in check, with the current account deficit expected to remain compressed and
international reserves standing at US$360 billion as of late-December 2016 (around 8 months of
import cover). Persistently-high household inflation expectations and large fiscal deficits remain key
macroeconomic challenges, which limit policy space for supporting growth through demand
measures. Furthermore, excess capacity in key industrial sectors and strains in financial and
corporate sector balance sheets remain a drag on private investment, and weak external demand
continues to constrain India’s exports.
The post-November 8, 2016 cash shortages and payment disruptions caused by the currency
exchange initiative have undermined consumption and business activity, posing a new challenge
to sustaining the growth momentum. Growth is projected to slow to 6.6 percent in FY2016/17,
then rebound to 7.2 percent in FY2017/18, due to temporary disruptions, primarily to private
consumption, caused by cash shortages. Tailwinds from a favorable monsoon, low oil prices and
continued progress in resolving supply-side bottlenecks, as well as robust consumer confidence,
will support near-term growth as cash shortages ease. The investment recovery is expected to
remain modest and uneven across sectors, as deleveraging takes place and industrial capacity
utilization picks up. With temporary demand disruptions and increased monsoon-driven food
supplies, inflation is expected at about 4.75 percent by early 2017—in line with the Reserve
Bank of India’s inflation target of 5 percent by March 2017. Supply-side reforms, particularly in

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

agriculture, continued fiscal consolidation, and relieving impediments to monetary transmission
are crucial to retain low inflation in the medium term. The current account deficit is expected
widen to about 2 percent of GDP over the medium term as domestic demand strengthens further
and commodity prices gradually rebound. The FY2016/17 Union Budget deficit target of 3.5
percent of GDP (equivalent to 3.8 percent of GDP in IMF terms) will likely be achieved.
Continued progress in reforms bodes well for a marked improvement in medium-term prospects,
with the adoption of the Goods and Services Tax poised to raise India’s medium-term GDP
growth to above 8 percent.
Economic risks are tilted to the downside. On the external side, despite the reduced imbalances
and strengthened reserve buffers, the impact from global financial market volatility could be
disruptive, including from U.S. monetary policy normalization or weaker-than-expected global
growth. In the absence of disruptive global financial volatility, slower growth in China, Europe
and the United States would have only modest adverse spillovers to India, given weak trade
linkages. A key domestic risk stems from the government’s currency exchange initiative, where
the near-term adverse economic impact of accompanying cash shortages remains difficult to
gauge, while it may have a positive economic impact in the medium term. Domestic risks also
flow from a potential further deterioration of corporate and public bank balance sheets, as well as
setbacks in the reform process, including in GST design and implementation, which could weigh
on domestic demand-driven growth and undermine investor and consumer sentiment. On the
upside, larger than expected gains from GST and further structural reforms could lead to
significantly stronger growth; while a sustained period of continued-low global energy prices
would also be very beneficial to India.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors noted India’s strong economic performance of the past few years and
commended the authorities for their strong policy actions, including continued fiscal
consolidation and an anti-inflationary monetary policy, which have underpinned macroeconomic
stability. Directors recommended continued vigilance to potential domestic and external shocks,
and urged the authorities to further advance economic and structural reforms to address supply
bottlenecks, raise potential output, create jobs, and ensure inclusive growth.
Directors supported the authorities’ efforts to clamp down on illicit financial flows, but noted the
strains that have emerged from the currency exchange initiative. They called for action to
quickly restore the availability of cash to avoid further payment disruptions, and encouraged
prudent monitoring of the potential side-effects of the initiative on financial stability and growth.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers
used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

Directors acknowledged the authorities’ strong policy push for cleaning up bank balance sheets
and welcomed legislation establishing the new bankruptcy code. Nonetheless, they noted that
elevated corporate sector risks and heightened levels of non-performing assets in public sector
banks continue to pose risks to banks’ soundness. Directors emphasized the importance of
augmenting capital buffers and continued governance reform of these banks, strengthening the
resolution regime for distressed bank assets by augmenting the capacity of newly established
mechanisms, and further measures to develop corporate debt markets, as key to enhancing the
financial system’s ability to contribute to growth.
Directors welcomed the completion of the institutional foundation of India’s flexible inflation
targeting regime, in particular the formation of the Monetary Policy Committee. Directors agreed
that given sticky and elevated household inflation expectations and food supply constraints,
continued vigilance on upside risks to inflation is needed. Directors recommended that the
Reserve Bank of India stand ready to raise the policy rate should inflationary pressures gather
pace. They also stressed the importance of continued agricultural reforms aimed at boosting food
supplies as well as maintaining fiscal adjustment to support monetary policy in achieving low
and stable inflation. Directors noted that India’s international reserves are assessed to be
adequate, and emphasized that the flexible exchange rate should continue to act as a key shock
absorber.
Directors emphasized that continued fiscal consolidation is critical to bring down the ratio of
public debt to GDP. They noted that fiscal consolidation will enable a gradual phasing-out of
financial repression, which will help price stability and lower the cost of credit for the private
sector, and rebuild space for counter-cyclical policy responses in the future. Implementation of a
robust goods and services tax, given its growth enhancing effects, and further subsidy reforms,
should be key pillars of the authorities’ fiscal consolidation strategy. Directors encouraged the
authorities to build on the fuel subsidy reforms and advances in financial inclusion to implement
better targeting and more efficient delivery of the remaining subsidies and social spending
programs.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ strong progress on structural reforms, and encouraged them
to prioritize labor market reforms at both the center and state levels. They also urged continued
efforts to reduce poverty and inequality, increase female labor force participation, and make
further efforts to improve financial inclusion. They noted the importance of further trade
liberalization and enhancing the business environment to help boost exports and attract greater
FDI flows.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2017 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
January 6, 2017

KEY ISSUES
Context. The Indian economy has recorded strong growth in recent years, helped by a large
terms of trade gain, positive policy actions including implementation of key structural reforms,
a return to normal monsoon rainfall, and reduced external vulnerabilities. Inflation has
remained low after the collapse in global commodity prices, a range of supply-side measures,
and a relatively tight monetary stance. Key macroeconomic challenges include persistentlyhigh household inflation expectations and large fiscal deficits, which limit policy space for
supporting growth through demand measures. Supply bottlenecks and structural
impediments are the main constraints to medium-term growth and job creation.
Outlook and Risks. Cash shortages arising from the currency exchange initiative have weakened
the near-term outlook. Medium-term growth prospects have improved due to the
implementation of key reforms, loosening of supply-side bottlenecks, and appropriate fiscal and
monetary policies that enhance macroeconomic stability. Risks are tilted to the downside, with
key external risks arising from intensified global financial volatility and slower global growth.
Key domestic risks include longer-than-anticipated cash shortages from the currency
exchange initiative and further weakening of bank and corporate balance sheets. Low-forlonger global oil prices and greater investor confidence due to reforms are upside risks.
Strategy. Action is needed to quickly restore cash in circulation and avoid payment disruptions.
Looking beyond this immediate challenge, policies should aim to reduce banking and corporate
vulnerabilities, durably lower sticky inflation expectations, continue fiscal consolidation, and
maintain the strong reform effort. Key elements:
 Safeguarding financial stability, given elevated corporate and banking sector strains by:
ensuring full recognition of non-performing assets on banks’ balance sheets;
strengthening public banks’ loss-absorbing buffers; implementing further public banking
sector structural reforms; and enhancing banks’ debt recovery mechanisms.
 Achieving durable disinflation. Real interest rates remain consistent with achieving the
inflation target of 5 percent CPI inflation by March 2017. Given medium-term upside risks
to food and CPI inflation, the authorities should stand ready to raise the policy rate if
inflationary pressures gather pace.
 Continuing with fiscal consolidation. The FY2015/16 Union Budget achieved its deficit
target of 3.9 percent of GDP (authorities’ definition), and the FY2016/17 Budget is on track
to reach the smaller deficit target of 3.5 percent of GDP. Further reductions in subsidies
and tax reforms, including implementation of the recently-approved GST, are needed to
achieve fiscal consolidation plans over the medium term.
 Maintaining the strong reform effort. Significant progress has been made in passing the
pan-India GST constitutional amendment, introducing a new bankruptcy code, using
Aadhaar identification and bank accounts to make direct benefit transfers, and enhancing
financial inclusion. Additional steps are needed to reduce supply bottlenecks, enhance the
efficiency of labor and product markets, and pursue further agricultural sector reforms.

CONTEXT: A CONSUMPTION-LED RECOVERY
1.
The Indian economy has recorded a strong growth in the recent past. After bottoming at
5.6 percent real GDP growth in FY2012/13, the economy has been on a gradual cyclical recovery,
reaching 7.6 percent growth in FY2015/16.1 As a result of wide-ranging policies to correct

Growth has been led by consumption, while investment growth has been weak.
Supported by a large and durable terms of trade gain, and more recently by a favorable
agricultural crop outlook (supported by normal monsoon rainfall) and decennial civil servant wage
revisions, private consumption remains the driving force of the Indian growth recovery. However,
investment has contracted sharply in the first half of FY2016/17, reflecting excess capacity in key
industrial sectors and strains in financial and corporate sector balance sheets. The post-November
8, 2016 cash shortages and payment disruptions caused by the currency exchange initiative
(withdrawal of the legal tender of Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes, which accounted for 86 percent of
the value of currency in circulation, and introduction of new Rs 500 and Rs 2000 notes) have
strained consumption and business activity, posing a new challenge to sustaining the growth

India’s Central Statistical Office released a new series of national accounts in January 2015, with base year 2011/12.
Methodological deficiencies of the revised national account statistics, as described in the 2016 Article IV Staff Report,
and the lack of back-casted historical GDP data, constrain a comparison of current growth with past growth.

India’s terms of trade has improved significantly (jumping by 2⅓ percent in 2013/14, by 3½ percent in 2014/15
and by a further 7 percent in 2015/16), supporting output growth and raising real incomes.

momentum. External demand has weakened further, with the growth of import volumes of India’s
trading partners decelerating to 2½ percent in 2015 from 4½ percent in the previous year.
3.
Progress on important economic and structural reforms over the past year has been
impressive. Over the past year, big bang reforms, such as the legislation of a new bankruptcy
code, formalization of inflation targeting framework, and a milestone constitutional amendment
enabling implementation of the pan-India Goods and Services Tax (GST), have taken place
alongside continued steps implementing the gradualist reform agenda of the Bharatiya Janata
Party (BJP)-led government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi (see Annex I: Key Policy Actions).
Notwithstanding its majority in the lower house of the national parliament, the BJP does not have
control of the upper house, thus requiring consensus building for the passage of key legislation.
As a result, securing passage of the GST constitutional amendment spanned several parliamentary
sessions and entailed compromise with regional parties.
4.
Past Fund advice and the authorities’ macroeconomic policies have been broadly
aligned. Consistent with Fund advice, fiscal consolidation at the Union government (central) level
resumed in FY2016/17, and has been complemented by measures to enhance the quality of public
spending. Excise duties on petrol and diesel have been raised further, and kerosene and fertilizer
subsidy reforms have been pursued. The stance of monetary policy in 2015–16 has been
maintained consistent with achieving the interim inflation targets along the RBI’s “glide path”, in
line with previous IMF advice. The passage of the Bankruptcy Act, enhancements to corporate
debt restructuring and bank governance, and measures to deepen domestic corporate bond
markets were also broadly in line with past IMF recommendations. The RBI has adopted a flexible
inflation targeting regime with a formal inflation target band (August 2016) and introduced a
statutory Monetary Policy Committee (September 2016). Progress on land, labor and agricultural
market reforms, however, has been limited.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
5.
The currency exchange initiative and its associated cash shortages are weighing
heavily on activity, and its impact on financial institutions should be monitored carefully.
Given the dominance of cash in everyday transactions, the post-November 8, 2016 decreased
availability of cash and associated payment disruptions caused by the currency exchange initiative
have strained consumption and business activity and the operations of the financial system,
posing a new challenge to sustaining the growth momentum (see Box 1). The supply of new
banknotes in the first month following the initiative was insufficient, even as the authorities took
multiple steps to ease the currency transition. The November PMI for both manufacturing and
services declined sharply, reflecting a large drop in output and new orders components. While the
financial system is expected to weather the currency exchange-induced temporary growth
slowdown, the authorities should remain vigilant to risks—in view of the potential further build-up
of NPAs, including among private banks and elevated corporate sector vulnerabilities—and
ensure prudent support to the affected economic sectors.

The repercussions from India’s currency exchange initiative will likely persist
through the first quarter of 2017. Real GDP growth is projected to slow to 6.6 percent in
FY2016/17 and then rebound to 7.2 percent in FY2017/18, due to temporary disruptions (primarily
to private consumption) caused by cash shortages accompanying the currency exchange initiative.
These effects are expected to gradually dissipate by March 2017 as cash shortages ease and
would be offset by tailwinds from a favorable monsoon and low oil prices, and continued
progress in resolving supply-side bottlenecks. Consumer sentiment remains strong, which will
support near-term growth recovery as cash shortages ease.3 The investment recovery is expected
to remain modest and uneven across sectors as deleveraging takes place and industrial capacity
utilization picks up. Headwinds from weaknesses in India’s bank balance sheets will also weigh on
near-term credit growth in the economy. Confidence and policy credibility gains, including from
continued fiscal consolidation and anti-inflationary monetary policy, continue to underpin
macroeconomic stability. Weak external demand, however, is expected to dampen net exports.

GST adoption and continued progress in reforms bode well for a marked
improvement in medium-term prospects. In staff’s view, the consumption-led growth path can
be sustained over the medium term, as real disposable incomes rise and India continues the
process of economic catch-up (given its very low per capita incomes). Although some
uncertainties remain around the design and pace of implementation of the GST, its adoption is
poised to help raise India’s medium-term GDP growth to above 8 percent as it will create a single
national market and enhance the efficiency of intra-Indian movement of goods and services.
8.
CPI inflation is expected to remain contained in the near term, but inflationary
pressures are set to rise in the second half of 2017. With temporary demand disruptions and
increased monsoon-driven food supplies, CPI inflation is expected at about 4¾ percent by early
2017—in line with the RBI inflation target of 5 percent by March 2017. However, inflationary
pressures are likely to reappear in the second half of 2017, in part reflecting government pay

reviews and the waning effects of the oil price collapse.4 Upside risks to inflation stem from
supply-side factors, such as volatility of agricultural prices, including due to possible smaller
harvests as a result of cash shortages inhibiting purchases of agricultural inputs.
9.
The current account deficit (CAD) is expected to remain compressed, helped by
continued low commodity-import prices. The CAD has declined sharply in recent years to an
average of 1.4 percent of GDP during FY2013/14–FY2015/16, and is expected to be about
1.1 percent of GDP (about US$25 billion) in 2016/17. This narrowing was helped by a decline in
commodity (oil and gold) prices. The CAD is expected to widen to about 2 percent of GDP over
the medium term, as domestic demand strengthens further and commodity prices gradually
rebound. Nonetheless, the weakening of trading

The rupee weakened and capital inflows reversed after the announcement of the
currency exchange initiative, but this may have also reflected the global capital flow
retrenchment from emerging market assets. In the two weeks after the announcement of the
currency exchange initiative on November 8, 2016, the rupee weakened by 2½ percent against
the U.S. dollar, portfolio capital outflows totaled US$3.5 billion, and the SENSEX equity index fell
by 6 percent. While the rupee subsequently rebounded by about 1 percent by mid-December,
portfolio outflows continued (cumulative outflows of US$2.2 billion so far during FY2016/17, after
inflows of US$6.8 billion prior to November 8).
11.
Bank credit growth remains moderate, reflecting demand and supply factors,
including slow corporate deleveraging, sector-specific strains, and further weakening of
bank asset quality. Even as the banking system’s ratio of stressed assets remained stable during
FY2015/16, subsequent to the Asset Quality Review (AQR), the system-wide gross non-performing
asset (NPA) ratio has risen from 5.1 percent in September 2015 to 7.6 percent in March 2016 and
is expected to rise further by an additional one percentage point towards the end of FY2016/17.
Aggregate credit growth remains modest, and is primarily led by private banks (one-quarter of
Indian banking system assets) and better performing public sector banks (PSBs). However, the

banking system’s capacity to expand credit is constrained by the weakened capital, profitability
and asset quality of many PSBs. The ability of the banking system to address its asset quality
distress will hinge on the success of the AQR, the new bankruptcy code, and asset reconstruction
mechanisms. Meanwhile, the investment plans of core industrial sectors remain thin, reflecting
still-low capacity utilization and deleveraging pressures. Nonetheless, capital markets, nonbank
financial institutions, and retained earnings will continue to support the commercial financing
needs of the economy.

Economic risks are tilted to the downside. On the external side, despite the reduced
imbalances and strengthened reserve buffers, the impact from global financial market volatility
could be disruptive, including from U.S. monetary policy normalization or weaker-than-expected
global growth. In the absence of disruptive global financial volatility, slower growth in China,
Europe and the United States would have only modest adverse spillovers to India, given weak
trade linkages. A key domestic risk stems from the government’s currency exchange initiative,
where the near-term adverse economic impact of accompanying cash shortages remains difficult
to gauge, while it may have a positive economic impact in the medium term. Domestic risks also
flow from a potential further deterioration of corporate and public bank balance sheets, as well as
setbacks in the reform process, including in GST design and implementation, which could weigh
on domestic demand-driven growth and undermine investor and consumer sentiment. On the
upside, larger than expected gains from the GST and further structural reforms could lead to
significantly stronger growth; while a sustained period of continued-low global energy prices
would also be beneficial to India (see Annex II: Risk Assessment Matrix).
Authorities’ Views
13.
The authorities were of the view that the near and medium-term outlook remains
encouraging. They emphasized the wide ranging reforms that have been implemented by the
country since the last Article IV consultations with IMF, which included promulgation of the Goods
and Services Tax Act, Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits and
Services) Act 2016, notification of Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016 and operationalization of
National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) and National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT)
for the new corporate insolvency framework, formalization of the monetary policy committee,

translated into stronger macroeconomic fundamentals and more resilient growth. The authorities
also indicated the role played by Direct Benefit Transfer and JAM (Jan Dhan Yojana bank
accounts, Aadhaar identification, and mobile banking) trinity in complementing efforts of the
government towards achievement of inclusive growth and fiscal consolidation. They expected
agricultural output to improve following the return to a normal monsoon, industrial output to firm
up, and services sector growth to remain stable. They agreed that while the replacement of
specific banknotes could weigh on economic activity in cash sensitive sectors in the short run, this
effect would not extend beyond two quarters, and would be outweighed by the positive mediumterm impact from a more efficient payments system and greater formalization of business
activities. Looking ahead, the authorities agreed with staff that the overall impact of the GST on
growth would be positive. More generally, the continuation of structural reforms would
strengthen growth outcomes in the medium term.
14.
Risks to the outlook were seen as coming more importantly from abroad. In
particular, the authorities felt that though weak global growth and the potential of financial
spillovers in a world characterized by highly accommodative monetary policies and negative
interest rates in many advanced economies posed risks for India, the country was well prepared to
navigate any accompanying turbulence. They also expressed concern about prospects for their
exports, stemming from a possible upsurge in protectionism in advanced economy markets.

KEY POLICY ISSUES
A.

Strengthening the Financial Sector and Reining in Risks

15.
The policy impetus to clean up banks’ balance sheets has led to a considerable
uptick in the recognition of non-performing assets (NPAs) among Indian banks. NPA
slippages, particularly among public sector banks (PSBs), accelerated considerably to 7.2 percent
in FY2015/16, up from 3.4 percent in FY2014/15.5 The sharp rise in new NPAs reflects a strong
policy impetus from the RBI to enforce robust asset quality recognition and a bank balance sheet
clean-up by March 2017, following an AQR initiated in December 2015. The share of restructured
assets in total advances receded to 4.1 percent, from 7.1 percent a year earlier, due to more active
re-classification of standard restructured loans into NPAs as a result of the AQR. However, the
ratio of stressed assets (restructured assets and NPAs) continued to edge up to 10.8 percent at
end-FY2015/16 (from 10 percent a year earlier), in part reflecting broader recognition of NPAs and
slippages in previously un-restructured exposures. Altogether, most AQR-related recognition of
NPAs appears to have already materialized.
16.
However, provisioning and debt recovery remain key challenges for banks. NPA
recognition has led to an uptick in provisioning, accounting for a further decline in PSBs'
profitability, with the ROA of PSBs turning negative in FY2015/16. However, the PSBs’ aggregate
provisioning coverage ratio continues to be low, at 39 percent as of end-FY2015/16, raising

concerns about its sufficiency.6 Moreover, PSBs’ loan recovery capacity remains weak, with efforts
to counteract the rise in NPAs met primarily through write-offs. Write-offs accounted for a
1.2 percentage-point offset in NPA slippage rates in FY2015/16, while loan recoveries accounted
for only 0.6 percentage points (down from 0.8 percentage points a year earlier), underscoring the
need for timely implementation of debt resolution reforms.

The slowly improving but still elevated corporate sector vulnerabilities continue to
pose risks to banks’ soundness. Corporate vulnerabilities have subsided in FY2015/16, reflecting
policy measures to ease supply-side bottlenecks. Firms’ debt-repayment capacity improved—the
share of debt held by firms with weak debt-repayment capacity (interest coverage ratio below
one) declined to 16.6 percent in FY2015/16, from 20.2 percent a year earlier (see Selected Issues
Chapter I).7 Leverage levels generally remain high, with debt of highly-levered firms (debt-toequity ratios above 150 percent) accounting for about a half of overall debt. Importantly, high
leverage is concentrated in certain industries—including metals and mining, construction and
engineering, and transportation and infrastructure—which jointly account for a large share of the
system’s debt-at-risk. The high debt-at-risk in

despite increased foreign exchange hedging.
18.
The slow deleveraging and repair of corporate balance sheets and the potential
further build-up of new NPAs can have detrimental effects on the real economy. The pace of
credit growth has so far been supported by government capital injections in PSBs and a shift of
credit demand toward private banks and alternatives to bank lending, such as commercial paper

Corporate FX funding via external commercial borrowings (ECBs) continued to account for about 13 percent of
total funding at end-March 2016. RBI data on intentions to hedge foreign currency (FX) debt suggest that
corporates’ hedging ratio (excluding natural hedges) increased to about 46.8 percent of borrowings in the first half
of FY2015/16, up from 33.8 percent in FY2013/14. Sensitivity tests also suggest that risks related to a rupee
depreciation and a rise in global funding rates are more pronounced relative to earlier years (FY2012/13).

(CP) funding.9 However, the need for capital preservation has led to a marked slowdown of credit
growth at PSBs, down to 4.0 percent year-on-year as of March 2016 from an average of
11.7 percent in the preceding three years (credit growth figures from RBI Financial Stability
Report). Altogether, a larger-than-anticipated increase in new NPA formation due to shocks
affecting corporates’ debt repayment capacity—e.g., due to weaker demand in certain sectors, or
exchange rate or interest rate shocks—or PSBs’ inability to raise adequate capital, could further
dampen the provision of credit to the real economy and impair growth (Figure). While the credit
intensity of the Indian economy is relatively low, the risk of an increase in NPAs is exacerbated by
high corporate leverage, which magnify banks’ losses in response to shocks, and has already been
a drag on domestic investment. The limited monetary and fiscal space in India constrains
policymakers’ capacity to counteract any additional increase in NPAs due to a long gestation of
corporate projects or further domestic or external shocks.

19.
PSBs’ capital augmentation needs are expected to have a modest fiscal impact. At
present, all PSBs meet Basel III capital requirements, with an aggregate common equity Tier 1
(CET-1) ratio of 8.7 percent as of end-FY2015/16, above the 6.125 minimum requirement
(including a capital conservation buffer, CCB) under India’s implementation schedule.10 However,
further balance sheet clean-up and Basel III implementation should account for additional PSB
recapitalization needs in the coming years, at about 1.5 to 2.4 percent of FY2018/19 GDP
(cumulatively over the next three years) under a simulation assuming a transition of 25 percent of
restructured loans to NPAs; 40 percent minimum provisioning coverage ratio; and build-up of an
additional 0 to 2 percentage-point capital buffer, respectively. Under this simulation, the
government share would range between 1 to 1.6 percent of FY2018/19 GDP (cumulatively over
9

The government announced in the FY2016/17 Budget injection of Rs 229 billion of capital in PSBs, 75 percent of
which was disbursed immediately to support lending operations and enable PSBs to tap market funding.

10 All but one bank (a private bank) currently meet Basel III’s minimum common equity tier-1 (CET 1) and Tier-1
capital requirements. Banks’ CET-1 capital positions were also supported by the RBI’s easing of capital
requirements in March 2016, permitting banks’ use of property holdings’ revaluation reserves, among others, as
CET-1 capital.

the next three years).11 This estimate includes a cumulative capital injection of 0.5–0.8 percent of
FY2018/19 GDP, related to the ongoing implementation of Basel III in India, expected to be
finalized by March 2019. However, recapitalization costs would be considerably higher if there is a
policy shift to more conservative provisioning requirements.
20.
Recent policy reforms have been extensive, targeting a PSB balance sheet clean-up,
and improving distressed asset resolution mechanisms. The AQR, initiated by the RBI in
December 2015, prompted banks to take active steps to recognize all NPAs and ensure the
achievement of clean and appropriately provisioned balance sheets by March 2017. In an effort to
improve debt resolution mechanisms, a scheme permitting debt-to-equity conversions of
unsustainable portions of banks' exposures was introduced by the RBI in June 2016.12 Importantly,
the new Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, adopted in May 2016, targets a drastic reduction in the
timing of bad asset resolution, from an existing average of 4.3 years to about 180 days, and
consolidates legal treatment of bankruptcy. Also, the regime for foreign ownership of Asset
Reconstruction Companies (ARCs) was relaxed, permitting foreigners to take full stakes in ARCs.
Further, the UDAY scheme, aimed at reviving distressed state-owned electricity distribution
companies (DISCOMs), envisages state governments taking on 75 percent of the DISCOMs’ debt
owed to banks which, together with accompanying measures to improve operational efficiency
should also help rein in further bank asset quality deterioration (see Box 2). Finally, the eligibility
criteria for government recapitalization support to troubled PSBs were amended in September
2016, and now focus on a PSB’s cost of operations, credit quality and ability to recover assets.
21.
Ensuring adequate capitalization, full recognition of risks on PSB’s balance sheets, and
NPA resolution are key to maintaining financial stability and enhancing the ability of the
financial sector to contribute to growth. In this regard, staff recommends:


Ensuring Adequate PSB Capitalization. To support PSBs' current lending capacity, the authorities
should consider larger government capital injections in PSBs and some divestments of banks’ noncore assets. The government’s capital injections in PSBs are thus far modest in scale (0.2 percent of
projected FY2018/19 GDP cumulatively over the next three years), and largely leave
recapitalizations up to affected PSBs to raise capital in the markets. The new recapitalization norms
introduced by the government are welcome, as they link potential support to performance, and
thus create a clear demarcation between better-performing and worse-performing banks, which
can open up the way for potential restructuring, including mergers and acquisitions, in the
banking sector.



NPA Resolution. A more comprehensive strategy, building on the Indian authorities’ policies to
boost banks’ NPA resolution capacity, is needed. In this regard, staff recommends the following:

The estimate for the government’s share assumes no dilution of government ownership in PSBs, currently at
about 61 percent. Implementation of the Basel III capital framework is progressing and is expected to be
completed by end-March 2019. However, potential Basel III-related risk weight changes might necessitate
additional capital infusions.
11

The Scheme for Sustainable Structuring of Stressed Assets (S4A).

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

INDIA

o

Continued stringent supervision. Following the conclusion of the AQR, the authorities
should persist in their commitment to robust supervision of banks’ activities, including
regulatory requirements for frequent in-depth reporting of NPA portfolios, ongoing
monitoring of banks’ capital and profitability, intensive on-site supervision, and enhanced
regulation and guidance. More robust provisioning should also be pursued.

o

Corporate debt resolution. Several asset restructuring mechanisms—including 5:25
Refinance Scheme, Strategic Debt Restructuring (SDR), and S4A—have been introduced
to facilitate corporate restructuring and debt resolution.13 As corporate debt
restructuring thus far has been limited, the authorities should place priority on
continuing to incentivize use of these mechanisms, and implementing measures to
rehabilitate distressed sectors. Efforts to improve corporate debt restructuring should
also ensure prompt implementation of the new Bankruptcy Code, and introduction of
out-of-court corporate debt restructuring mechanisms.

o

Distressed debt markets. The market for distressed debt in India is underdeveloped,
and suffers from difficulties in price discovery and low capitalization of Asset
Reconstruction Companies (ARCs). The authorities should follow through on recent
steps taken to develop this market in India, and should examine the costs and benefits
of market-based mechanisms for the rehabilitation of distressed, but viable, firms,
such as corporate restructuring vehicles that rely on asset management companies
with experience in corporate turnarounds.14



PSB Governance Reforms. The authorities should follow through on their commitment to structural
reforms, as outlined in the Indradhanush plan (August 2015), by strengthening ongoing NPA
disclosures; enhancing PSBs’ governance (including risk management practices and
accountability); and considering divestments and mergers.



Banks’ Statutory Liquidity Requirement. As the general government fiscal deficit continues to
contract, the Statutory Liquidity Requirement (SLR) should be reduced further to facilitate
more private sector lending, which can also be positive for the further development of the
corporate bond market. The Indian government has been gradually reducing the SLR rate
(currently at 20.5 percent, down from 25 percent of deposit liabilities in mid-2008).

22.
The authorities should continue their efforts to develop the domestic corporate debt
market. Pursuant to the recommendations of the Khan Committee, Indian regulators have
introduced wide-reaching reforms (see Box 3). The new measures should provide a fillip to the

13

Under the 5:25 refinance scheme, banks can extend loan repayments for up to 25 years, with an option of loan
refinancing every five years.

These include new RBI guidelines on banks’ sales of distressed assets; and liberalization of FDI in ARCs by
increasing the investment limit under the automatic route to 100 percent of the paid-up capital of an ARC (from
49 percent previously). FIIs/FPIs are now also allowed to invest up to 100 percent of each tranche of ARC-issued
Security Receipts (SRs), subject to sectoral caps.

development of the Indian corporate bond market, but would be made more effective by: (i)
strengthening corporate balance sheets through vigorous rehabilitation and restructuring to raise
demand for corporate bond issuances; (ii) developing risk transfer mechanisms, including the
CDS market, to better support domestic institutional investment; and (iii) ensuring continued
coordination on developing the bond market across key relevant agencies, including the
Government of India, RBI, and Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).15
23.
The Indian government continues to work towards enhancing financial inclusion.
The financial inclusion agenda has broadened over the past two years, evolving from providing
greater access to bank accounts and financial services to introducing more remunerative savings
vehicles to diminish the luster of traditional gold-based savings. The government’s introduction of
gold monetization schemes can boost financial intermediation by channeling domestic gold
holdings to gold savings accounts, although uptake thus far has been minimal. The launch of
Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) in August 2014 led to the opening of bank accounts for
254 million previously unbanked individuals (see Box 4). There is now continued emphasis on
increasing transactional volumes on the PMJDY accounts (including by Aadhaar-supported direct
benefit transfers). 16 The Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana (PMMY) scheme has sought to facilitate
access to formal finance for micro, small and medium-sized enterprises through collateral-free
loans, with close to 1 percent of GDP in loans having been disbursed under this scheme. The
emphasis on financial inclusion should continue to be facilitated by new technologies, making greater
use of mobile phone payments technology, such as the Unified Payments Interface platform
introduced earlier this year, which links use of multiple bank accounts with banking services,
including person-to-person transfers and merchant payments.
Authorities’ Views
24.
The authorities agreed that corporate balance sheets in some sectors remain
strained, but noted that steps were being taken to address vulnerabilities, including in the
banking sector. They saw early signs that the financial health of listed corporates is improving.
Efforts continue to reactivate stalled investment projects in the infrastructure sector, while the
UDAY scheme is contributing to balance sheet repair for electricity distribution companies. On the
banking side, the AQR has imposed a homogenous loan classification standard across the system
and has been triggering adequate recognition, allowing the focus to shift to the resolution of
NPAs. The mechanisms put in place by the RBI allow for tailored workouts depending on the
specific causes of asset impairment, and the authorities expect an increase in their use while
acknowledging that the resolution process will be gradual and take time. The new insolvency
regime assigns a limited role to tribunals and already ensures dialogue between debtors and

creditors. Nonetheless, the authorities are currently looking at the draft Arbitration Act to
introduce some clauses that would allow out-of-court settlement.
25.
The authorities underscored their commitment to ensuring adequate bank
capitalization as per prudential requirements, maintaining stringent supervision, and
deepening financial inclusion efforts. They pointed out that of the estimated capital needs of
public sector banks (Rs 1.8 trillion through FY2018/19), Rs 0.7 trillion was to be infused by the
Government. As part of this plan, the Government has infused Rs 250 billion in FY2015/16 and is
infusing Rs 229 billion in FY2016/17. Banks have raised additional AT1 and Tier II capital in the
market. Remaining capital needs would be covered from these alternative sources. With regard to
staff’s assessment of remaining vulnerabilities, the authorities pointed out that the interest
coverage ratio as a gauge for underlying corporate balance sheet health needs to be viewed in
the context of cyclically depressed profits. They also noted that the decline in the provision
coverage of banks reflected the countercyclical nature of the provisioning regime. They pointed
out that the leverage ratio at sample levels were quite sensitive to sample selections and that the
system-level leverage of Indian corporates was not large, while it was stressed for certain sectors.

After some pick-up earlier in the year, CPI inflation has moderated in recent months.
CPI inflation declined from an average of 9.8 percent during 2011–13 to an average of 4.9 percent
in FY2015/16, driven by the collapse in global commodity prices, a range of supply-side measures,
and a relatively tight monetary stance. Inflation dropped to 3.6 percent in November 2016, from
an average of 5.4 percent in the first half of FY2016/17, largely due to a fall in the prices of
vegetables. Underlying inflation momentum remained steady, however, with core inflation
averaging 4.7 percent from April to November. Given the disinflation shock from the currency
exchange initiative, widening the output gap to around ¾ of one percent of GDP, inflation is
expected to remain at about 4¾ percent in March

susceptible to volatile price movements.
27.
Following the policy rate cuts in 2015–16, monetary conditions remain consistent
with coming near the RBI’s interim inflation target of 5 percent by March 2017. With the real
policy interest rate at about 1.25 percent, which is at the lower end of the mission’s estimated

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

INDIA

neutral range of about 1.25–1.75 percent given current external conditions, the monetary policy
stance is assessed to be broadly neutral. Any inflationary effects of the GST when implemented
are expected to be small and transitory—if needed, the monetary policy response should be
geared toward containing potential second-round effects. Given medium-term upside risks to
food and CPI inflation, the authorities should stand ready to raise the policy rate if inflationary
pressures gather pace.
28.
Monetary policy credibility has strengthened with the finalization of the flexible
inflation targeting framework and agreement on the official medium-term inflation target.
Amendments to the RBI Act and the formation of the Monetary Policy Committee (September
2016) completed the statutory underpinning of flexible inflation targeting, and the headline CPI
inflation target of 4 percent with a symmetrical band of 2 percent was retained as the official
inflation target for the next five years (August 2016). The RBI has taken steps to improve the
operating framework and has focused on enabling greater transmission of policy rate cuts. These
steps include adjusting the liquidity management framework, guidelines to ensure consistency in
banks’ calculation of lending rates, and more frequent revisions of administered rates on small
savings schemes.17 The increase in banking system liquidity as a result of the currency exchange
initiative can reduce banks’ funding costs and thereby lead to a decline in bank lending rates.
Nonetheless, bringing down inflation expectations of the general public and anchoring them at a
lower level has proven challenging, as food inflation propagates rapidly into non-food inflation,
and household inflation expectations remain near double digits.18 Terminating the adaptive
nature of Indian household inflation expectations will likely require a prolonged period of low
inflation, underpinned by a continued anti-inflationary monetary policy stance.

Supply-side reforms, particularly in agriculture, continued fiscal consolidation, and
relieving impediments to monetary transmission are prerequisites for low inflation in the
medium term. While inflation targeting has served India well over the past two years, by
providing a well-defined nominal anchor and a clear policy objective and thus improving policy

communication, further reforms will need to complement the new framework to durably reduce
inflation. Consensus Surveys show that five-year ahead inflation expectations have come down by
about ¾ of one percentage point since 2014, but remain above the midpoint of the inflation
target band (4 percent CPI inflation). In view of India’s large weight on food in its CPI basket and
structurally-high food inflation, achieving this target on a sustained basis will require structural
reforms to ramp up food supply commensurate with strong consumption demand. Staff sees
scope to improve food grain buffer stock management, and for increasing investment in storage
and distribution infrastructure for perishable produce. Continued fiscal consolidation to narrow
public sector demand for credit remains paramount for the success of the new monetary
framework, as does further reducing impediments to monetary transmission (including reductions
in still-high SLR rates).19
Authorities’ Views
30.
The authorities were confident about the prospects of keeping inflation close to the
center of the target band in the medium-term. They considered the current monetary stance
to be accommodative and noted that the future stance would be data dependent. The authorities
agreed that the output gap remained negative, and they estimated that the neutral real interest
rate had declined to 1.25 percent. In their view, recent reforms to the monetary policy and
liquidity management framework had improved the transmission of monetary policy. Anchoring
household expectations has remained a challenge, but the authorities felt that these should not
be overemphasized in policy setting, as inflation expectations appeared backward-looking and
closely related to food inflation at the time of the survey. The authorities agreed with staff on the
importance of continued supply-side reforms to keep food inflation low and help anchor inflation
expectations.

C.

Continuing Fiscal Consolidation

31.
The near-term fiscal policy envisages a gradual reduction in fiscal deficits. The
FY2015/16 Union Budget execution was in line with the target, as a series of fuel excise hikes
offset higher-than-expected food subsidies and a shortfall in corporate income tax and
disinvestment proceeds. Accordingly, revenue measures allowed for a planned ¼ of one
percentage point increase in the ratio of public investment to GDP, which had been on a declining
trend for several years. The FY2016/17 Budget targets a fiscal deficit of 3.5 percent of GDP
(equivalent to about 3.8 percent of GDP in IMF terms) and thus a return to fiscal consolidation, as
has been consistently advocated by staff, and which is expected to be achieved. The key risk to
the current year’s revenue target is the repercussions from the currency exchange initiative, which
could dent tax collections and disinvestment receipts (which are classified as revenues under the
authorities’ definition). Meeting the deficit target may necessitate expenditure cuts, including
19
On asymmetric monetary transmission, see S. Das (2015), “Monetary Policy in India: Transmission to Bank
Interest Rates,” IMF WP 15/129. Transmission would benefit from reducing the SLR over time to a level in line with
the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR), continued focus on increasing competition in the banking sector, and further
progress on financial inclusion, which will decrease the presence of informal finance.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

lower capital spending. The authorities should leverage the increase in the formal economy as a
result of the currency exchange initiative, as well as associated income declaration schemes, to
expand the tax revenue base. If needed, the authorities should continue to take the opportunity to
raise petroleum-product taxes while oil prices remain low.
32.
The authorities have made strong progress on subsidy reforms in the past two years.
A major decline in the subsidy bill (down from 2.5 percent of GDP in FY2012/13 to about
1.5 percent of GDP expected in FY2016/17) has been achieved. This involved the near-elimination
of fuel subsidies, and increasing use of direct benefit transfers to channel the remaining
commodity subsidies (including the PAHAL scheme for cooking gas, and digitization and Aadhaar
seeding of Public Distribution System food subsidy beneficiaries) and social payments. The
Aadhaar Act passed in early 2016 is an important reform that enables linking of entitlements and
subsidies to biometric identification of beneficiaries, thereby advancing more efficient targeting of
social programs.
33.
With continued delays in reaching the medium-term deficit target, India’s public
debt ratio is projected to remain high and decline only gradually. Even though introduction
of the GST has helped clarify the government’s medium-term fiscal plans, in the absence of major
additional expenditure reforms, achievement of the Union deficit target of 3 percent of GDP by
FY2017/18 and thereafter,20 may be further delayed. Such delays could undermine confidence and
credibility, and reduce available fiscal space for priority spending in the medium term. Staff’s
projections, which are on the basis of current policies and assume no major legislative changes,
suggest that the central government will underperform against its fiscal adjustment targets. In
addition, salary increases by the states will not only impede reduction of state budget deficits but
will also likely entail public investment cuts in states bound by the borrowing limits. The general
government fiscal deficit is thus projected to remain elevated in the range of 6–7 percent of GDP
through FY2018/19. Accordingly, public debt as a share of GDP is projected to remain at almost
70 percent by end-FY2016/17, and will decline gradually over the medium term, remaining above
India’s debt tolerance range (60–65 percent of GDP) for several years.21 India’s public debt, with a
favorable maturity structure and currency composition, as well as a captive domestic investor
base, is expected remain sustainable (see Annex III: Debt Sustainability Analysis).22
34.
India has limited fiscal space given the need to reduce its high level of public debt.
India’s general government deficit is high by global standards, posing a challenge to durably
20

To institutionalize financial discipline in public finances, the 2003 Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management
(FRBM) Act introduced a medium-term ceiling for the central government’s fiscal deficit of 3 percent of GDP. As
per FRBM, state deficits have been effectively bound by a borrowing limit of 3 percent of any given state’s GDP,
and states’ deficits have on average remained near the limits. The FRBM Review Committee is at present
examining the pros and cons behind altering the fiscal rules attached to the FRBM.

21

Even though the general government primary deficit is estimated to have declined by about ¾ of one percent
of GDP during FY2014/15-FY2015/16, the lower contribution of automatic debt dynamics on account of slower
nominal GDP growth contributed to an increase in public debt ratio. In addition, states have issued about Rs 1.6
trillion in UDAY bonds since the launch of the scheme in November 2015, which did not count towards states’
annual borrowing limits but increased the public debt stock by over one percent of GDP.

22

India’s sovereign debt credit ratings are at the lowest investment grade (Moody’s Baa3; S&P BBB-; Fitch BBB-).

reducing inflation. In addition, the interest cost of public debt is one fourth of general
government revenues, and financial repression (operating through the SLR) ensures low real
interest rates on public debt and helps underpin debt sustainability. Reducing the SLR, making
more room for private credit, can safely proceed only if the debt burden is reduced.
35.
Staff sees merit in strengthening the fiscal responsibility framework of the center to
anchor policies. To limit pro-cyclical fiscal policy, the fiscal responsibility framework could feature
a ceiling on nominal expenditure growth and be underpinned by a medium-term fiscal framework
to facilitate better planning and protect public investment. Staff also recommends anchoring the
deficit reduction path by setting a medium-term public debt target and specifically a debt-to-GDP
ratio of 60 percent, in line with staff estimates of India’s debt tolerance range.23 Rebuilding of
fiscal space should be complemented by reorienting public expenditure away from untargeted
subsidies towards growth-enhancing capital and social spending.
36.
Implementing a robust goods and services tax (GST), enhancing fiscal federalism,
and continued subsidy reforms are policy priorities. Staff recommends:
Tax reform. India’s tax revenue-to-GDP ratio (at around 17½ percent) remains
considerably below its emerging market peers. Implementation of a robust GST should be a key
priority given its growth-enhancing effects. The GST should have minimal exemptions, uniform
cross-state rates, and as few tax rate tiers as possible (see Box 5). Key production inputs, such as
energy and real estate, should be kept within the tax base to enable greater output gains and
reduce the tax burden across sectors. Rationalization of the structure of direct taxes toward a
lower corporate income tax rate with smaller and streamlined deductions and exemptions should
continue. Efforts to improve tax administration should be stepped up as the scope for revenue
gains is large.



Fiscal discipline. Rebuilding general government fiscal space and increasing the efficiency
of public expenditure call for enhancing fiscal institutions of both the Union and the states. Fiscal
responsibility frameworks should be strengthened to ensure compliance with fiscal targets and
the quality of fiscal adjustment, including through setting up of an independent fiscal council for
the center, strengthening medium-term expenditure and budget frameworks, and moving to
accrual accounting (see Selected Issues Chapter III). The authorities should take advantage of the
newly-created establishment of the South Asia Regional Technical Assistance and Training Center
(SARTTAC), based in New Delhi, to strengthen institutional capacity and skills, including at the
state level.



Subsidy reform. Overhauling India’s food and fertilizer subsidy regime via better targeting,
improving efficiency, and reducing distortions can generate substantial fiscal gains. Untargeted
food subsidies should be pared back, including by rationalizing the list of eligible beneficiaries
and reforming the inefficient Food Corporation of India (FCI) and the Public Distribution System


23

IMF staff analysis (see Selected Issues Chapter II) suggests that India’s estimated debt-to-GDP threshold for
maintaining its current level of market creditworthiness lies in the range of 65-70 percent. Inclusion of some buffer
to account for uncertainty (including for the materialization of contingent liabilities), suggests a debt ratio of 60–
65 percent of GDP.

(PDS) network. Wider application of the current approach to non-food subsidy payments—namely
direct benefit transfers, increased financial inclusion, and use of the Aadhaar identification system
to better identify beneficiaries—should continue to yield large fiscal savings (see also Selected
Issues Chapter IV).
Authorities’ Views
37.
The authorities reiterated their commitment to achieving the 3.5 percent of GDP
deficit target (authorities’ definition) in 2016/17. They stated that any slippage in spectrum
sales would be made up by buoyancy in tax receipts (including revenues from the income
declaration scheme. Moreover, interest expenses were expected to be lower than budgeted owing
to the recent contraction of sovereign yields.
38.
Looking ahead, the authorities would continue to balance adherence to fiscal
consolidation with a commitment to increase investment and social spending. Further
consolidation would be achieved through higher growth and revenue mobilization from other
sources. The authorities noted that the 2017/18 deficit target would be finalized once the FRBM
Review Committee recommendations had been received and reviewed. The authorities were
confident that the outstanding issues related to GST implementation could be settled promptly.
The GST would provide for a significant improvement over the current indirect tax system. Tax
reform priorities going forward include continuing the phased reduction of the corporate income
tax rate from 30 to 25 percent over four years, coupled with a simultaneous reduction in tax
deductions. On the expenditure side, initiatives such as the rationalization of centrally-sponsored
schemes, the advancement of the Union Budget presentation by one month for better execution
planning, the merger of the railways budget with the Union budget, elimination of distinction
between plan and non-plan expenditure, and the gradual replacement of generalized subsidies by
direct benefit transfers, would all enhance the quality of public spending (see also Annex V:
Expenditure Reforms).

D.

Maintaining External Stability

39.
India’s external position remains broadly consistent with medium-term
fundamentals and desirable policy settings, and reserves are assessed to be adequate (see
Annex IV on External Sector Assessment). Following a US$55 billion increase in international
reserves over FY2014/15 and FY2015/16, driven by robust capital inflows (chiefly FDI and FPI
portfolio equity flows), reserves have remained close to their end-March 2016 level, standing at
about US$360 billion as of late-December 2016, slightly above 150 percent of the IMF’s reserve
adequacy metric and around 8 months of import cover. Foreign exchange (FX) intervention
continues to be guided by the need to limit excessive volatility, and has been limited during 2015
and 2016. While positive policy settings and continued macroeconomic stability have reduced
external vulnerabilities, there is a continued need for vigilance given sharp movements in global
commodity prices and global financial market volatility.

Boosting exports remains a key challenge. Despite a sharp contraction in merchandise
exports, India’s trade balance improved in 2015/16 due to an increase in the oil trade balance by
about 2 percent of GDP as well as weak non-oil import growth. The contraction in merchandise
exports was partly due to the collapse in commodity prices (refined petroleum products made up
about one-fifth of the value of goods exports in 2014/15), weak global demand, and ongoing
appreciation of the rupee real effective exchange rate.24 Nonetheless, India’s export performance
was comparable to that of emerging market peers, and its share in world merchandise exports has
remained relatively stable. While India’s

41.
Although India’s external financing requirements have declined with shrinking
current account imbalances, further enhancing the environment for attracting stable, nondebt creating capital flows, particularly FDI, remains important. In the past two years, several
steps have been taken toward this goal, including by liberalizing caps on FDI inflows in most
sectors—this has helped FDI inflows increase from US$31 billion in FY2013/14 to over US$45
billion in FY2015/16, far exceeding the FY2015/16 CAD of US$22 billion (see Selected Issues
Chapter VI). Nonetheless, a more conducive business environment is necessary to attract even
greater FDI flows and help ensure the success of the “Make in India” initiative. In addition,
restrictions on foreign borrowing by firms were relaxed in 2015 and limits for foreign portfolio
investors’ (FPI) purchases of government bonds were increased in 2016. India’s external debt
remains low at 23 percent of GDP at end-June 2016, given that net external borrowing by Indian
corporates was minimal in 2014/15 and 2015/16. Further liberalization of external commercial
borrowings (ECBs) should proceed cautiously and be carefully monitored by the RBI, given
continuing corporate vulnerabilities.
42.
In the event of a surge in global financial market volatility, India should continue to
rely on exchange rate flexibility as the main shock absorber. As consistently advocated by
24 Using staff’s average estimated income elasticity of exports of 1.5, in the absence of further measures to
enhance competiveness, India’s merchandise export growth will likely remain below 10 percent per annum (see M.
Raissi and V. Tulin (2015), “Price and Income Elasticity of Indian Exports: Supply-Side Bottlenecks,” IMF WP 15/161).

According to the World Trade Organization’s 2016 World Tariff Profile, India’s tariff rate (a simple average of
MFN tariff rates) is 13.4 percent for all products, 32.7 percent for agricultural products, and 10.1 percent for nonagricultural products—in all three cases India’s rates are among the highest across emerging market economies.

staff, to minimize disruptive movements in the currency divorced from fundamentals, continued
exchange rate flexibility could be accompanied by judicious FX intervention, either through spot
and forward markets, or via liquidity provision through swaps.
Authorities’ Views
43.
The authorities concurred with the assessment of the external position. They were
broadly comfortable with the current level of reserves, but noted that the direction of reserves
would depend on developments in capital flows. While the trade deficit was likely to widen due to
weakening terms of trade and remittances have declined, the current account deficit was expected
to remain relatively subdued and below its sustainable level, which they estimated at about
2⅓ percent of GDP. The authorities attributed recent export weakness mainly to sluggish external
demand. They were optimistic about scope to expand exports, given the country’s small global
market share, for which a number of supportive initiatives were being implemented in trade
facilitation and infrastructure, including the development of coastal employment zones. The
authorities underscored their commitment to an open trade regime, noting that once agricultural
products are excluded, India’s tariffs were broadly comparable to those of other emerging market
peers. The authorities expressed concern that India is confronting rising non-tariff barriers in
export markets, though the country had refrained from increasing import restrictions except for
anti-dumping measures.

Note: OECD produces a reform responsiveness indicator that measures the extent of reform in five broad
areas: (i) product and labor market regulations, (ii) human capital formation, (iii) tax and benefits systems,
(iv) trade and investment regulation, and (v) innovation policies. The reform responsiveness indicator reflects
the share of policy recommendations from OECD's "Going for Growth" reports on which the country has
taken significant action.

45.
Among the long agenda of reforms, labor market reforms should take increasing
priority. The reform agenda includes addressing long-standing supply bottlenecks, labor and
product market reforms, and improving the business climate.26 A comprehensive package of
structural reforms remains the preferred approach, with priority given to labor market reforms to
facilitate greater and better quality job creation, and enhance the impact of recent product market
reforms. Building on recent progress, key necessary measures include:

See IMF India Article IV Staff Reports of 2014, 2015 and 2016 for additional details. Such policy priorities for
India have also been identified in the OECD 2016 report Going for Growth.

26

22

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

INDIA



Labor market reforms. Greater labor market flexibility and product market competition remain
essential to create jobs and raise growth. More specifically, reforms to the Industrial Disputes Act
(IDA) of 1947—which requires firms employing 100 or more workers to obtain government
permission for layoffs, retrenchments, and closures—along with reforms to various restrictive
clauses under the Factories Act of 1948, are key. In addition, reducing the numbers of labor laws,
currently numbering around 250 at central and state level (these govern different aspects of the
labor market such as minimum wages, resolution of industrial disputes, conditions for hiring and
firing workers, and conditions for the closure of establishments), is also essential. Such reforms are
key to increasing the employment of women, broadening the manufacturing base, and taking
advantage of India’s favorable demographics by increasing employment in the formal sector of
the economy. They are also of highest priority from a sequencing perspective, as they can enhance
the positive impact of other structural reforms, strengthen the effectiveness of macroeconomic
policy, and also help boost ongoing economic recovery (see Selected Issues Chapter VII).



Land reforms. Streamlining and expediting land acquisition and simplification of procedures, at
both the center and state levels, remain a priority, including to facilitate and expedite infrastructure
development.



Power reforms. Building on the UDAY scheme for state power distribution companies, the policy
focus should now switch to implementing measures to improve the operational efficiency of the
state power distribution companies, including reducing transmission losses and raising power
tariffs when needed. Energy price reforms should consider regulatory policies for reducing fossil
fuel use in India, including to aid achievement of India’s climate change commitments (see
Selected Issues Chapter VIII).



Gender-focused reforms. Improvements in infrastructure—such as wider sanitation coverage,
easier access to roads and drinking water—that lower females’ home care burden are key to
increasing India’s female labor force participation that will help India achieve its economic
growth potential (see Box 6). Moreover,

Agricultural sector reforms remain a policy priority for the Government, but the
pace of implementation has been slow. The agricultural sector contributes around 15 percent
of India’s GDP, and provides employment for about half of the Indian labor force. Some of the
recent agricultural policy initiatives undertaken by the Modi Government include: the assured
irrigation initiative under the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana launched in July 2015; the
comprehensive crop insurance scheme Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana launched in February
2016; and the common electronic trading platform for National Agriculture Market (e-NAM)
launched in April 2016, which aims to integrate 585 wholesale markets across India by March,
2018. These arrangements are expected to reduce production risk and improve the
competitiveness of agricultural markets.
47.
While these agricultural policy measures are welcome, much more needs to be done
to address inherent long-term structural bottlenecks and help ease food inflation pressures.
Building on recent progress, key measures should include:



Food procurement reforms. The reforms should include a revamp of government procurement
processes and the public distribution system (PDS) for food. While the system of minimum
support prices (backed by assured procurement) can help stabilize markets during periods of
weak production or excess supply, it should be limited to correcting market failures. Past hikes
in procurement prices for rice and wheat, combined with the government’s massive cereal
stockpiling, have resulted in market distortions (including a shortfall in the production of
legumes) and episodes of high food inflation. Implementing the recommendations of the
Shanta Kumar High Level Committee (HLC) on restructuring the role of the Food Corporation
of India (FCI)—including outsourcing of cereal procurement and stocking operations currently
under the FCI to the states and various agencies; better price support for pulses and oilseeds;
introducing cash transfers; and setting up vigilance committees to check leakages in the
PDS—would improve the efficiency of the entire food grain management system.27



Reforms to the Essential Commodities Act (ECA) and state-level Agricultural Produce Marketing
Committee (APMC) Act. These Acts are the key regulatory pillars empowering the central and
state governments to regulate and control production, distribution, marketing and pricing of
commodities identified as essential for consumers. While the intention of these Acts was to
ensure that farmers were offered fair and transparent prices, it has led to multiple market
intermediaries operating between the farmer and the consumer leading to market price
manipulations, and higher prices for consumers while farmers continue to receive meager
returns (see Selected Issues Chapter XII). Reforms pertaining to marketing in agriculture, in
line with NITI (National Institution for Transforming India) Aayog’s recommendations to

INDIA

liberalize markets by giving farmers more flexibility in the distribution and marketing of their
produce, will help raise the competitiveness, efficiency and transparency in state agriculture
markets.28


Subsidized water and other agricultural inputs. The government provides subsidies to the
agriculture sector through free or cheap water, electricity and fertilizers. This has had a large
negative impact on ground-water levels, soil fertility and production efficiency for both inputs
and outputs in agriculture. Input subsidies to farmers should be administered through direct
cash transfers rather than underpricing of agricultural inputs, in accordance with the
recommendations of the Kumar HLC, and be directed towards small-scale farmers.

Authorities’ Views
48.
The authorities highlighted the progress made in facilitating investments in road,
power and coal sectors, furthering their important reform agenda, and expressed a strong
commitment to continue strengthening public service delivery and enhancing the business
environment. They highlighted the significant gains in targeted delivery of services through
application of Direct Benefit Transfer to flagship welfare schemes and subsidy programs. They
expected that the ongoing shift toward a systematic evaluation and monitoring of outcomes,
rather than inputs and processes, would deliver improvements in the quality and effectiveness of
public policies and services. At the level of states, the publication and ranking of policy outcomes
was generating reform momentum through cross-state competition and dissemination of best
practices. The authorities pointed to ongoing reform efforts in many priority areas. Labor market
reforms were most effectively pursued at the level of states, with a few states already enacting
such reforms. In their view, the objective should be to expand labor reforms to a critical mass of
states with a strong manufacturing base. In the agricultural sector, the authorities noted that pilot
programs are underway to rationalize fertilizer subsidies, while the Union government is working
with state governments to integrate agricultural markets across the country.

F. Other Issues
49.
Macroeconomic statistics are broadly adequate for surveillance but improvements
are needed in several areas. Priority should be given to developing price indices suitable for
deriving volume estimates for key economic activities in the national accounts and updating the
index of industrial production, particularly given its use in compiling national accounts statistics. In
addition, efforts to back-cast the revised national accounts should be stepped up. There is also
scope to improve the timely reporting and dissemination of fiscal performance of the states. The
authorities should take advantage of the impending establishment of SARTTAC to obtain
technical assistance in enhancing the quality of Indian national accounts statistics.
28

In October 2016, NITI Aayog launched an index to rank states based on initiatives taken by them in
implementing farm sector reforms. The index ranges from a score of 0 (no reforms at all) to 100 (complete
implementation of reforms) and is based on three major parameters—reforms in agriculture marketing, land
reforms, and reforms related to agro-forestry. While Maharashtra achieved the highest rank (with a score of 82),
almost two thirds of India’s 29 states have made slow progress with an index score below 50.

STAFF APPRAISAL
50.
The Indian economy has recorded strong growth in the past few years, helped by
terms of trade gains, implementation of key structural reforms, and reduced external
vulnerabilities. A halving of global oil prices, sound macroeconomic management, and
continuous efforts to tackle supply-side bottlenecks have been key to India’s ongoing growth
recovery and macroeconomic stability. Despite a weak global environment, the important
structural reforms initiated over the past two years will help India continue to stand out among
the world’s fastest growing EMs.
51.
While the medium-term growth outlook remains favorable, the economy faces nearterm challenges. In FY2017/18 economic growth is expected to rebound from a temporary
slowdown caused by the currency exchange initiative, which is adversely affecting private
consumption, the key growth driver of the past few years. The investment recovery is expected to
remain modest and uneven across sectors as deleveraging continues and industrial capacity
utilization picks up. The balance of risks is tilted to the downside. A key downside risk is the
currency exchange initiative which will likely have medium-term positive benefits in curtailing tax
evasion, but may have a larger-than-anticipated negative impact on the economy in the near term
through weaker private consumption. Additional risks include renewed global market volatility,
uncertainty in design and implementation of the GST, and continued weak corporate and public
bank balance sheets. Prominent upside risks include lower-for-longer energy prices and enhanced
investor confidence accompanying structural reforms.
52.
Action is needed to quickly restore cash in circulation and avoid payment
disruptions. The authorities should continue to enhance the supply of new banknotes, and if
needed consider extending or expanding targeted temporary exemptions, including on use of old
banknotes, particularly for rural and remote areas. While the financial system is expected to
weather the currency exchange-induced temporary growth slowdown, the authorities should
remain vigilant given the potential further build-up of NPAs and elevated corporate sector
vulnerabilities, and ensure prudent support to the economic sectors affected by the currency
exchange initiative.
53.
Despite a strong policy push for balance sheet clean up, elevated corporate sector
vulnerabilities continue to pose risks to the soundness of public banks. While India’s financial
system is generally sound, the RBI should continue to ensure full recognition of non-performing
assets on banks’ balance sheets and increase provisioning requirements as needed. The successful
implementation of the AQR process, the new bankruptcy code, and additional debt recovery
mechanisms will bridge critical gaps in the resolution of bank asset quality distress and enhance
financial stability. Augmenting capital buffers in public banks, strengthening the NPA resolution
regime and public sector bank governance reform, as well as further measures to develop
corporate debt markets, are key to enhancing the financial system’s ability to contribute to
growth. India’s strong efforts in enhancing financial inclusion should continue to be facilitated by
new technologies and greater use of electronic payment technologies.

26

54.
Monetary policy credibility has strengthened, yet achieving a low and stable rate of
inflation in the medium-term hinges on further supply-side reforms and continued fiscal
consolidation. The recent formalization of the flexible inflation targeting regime and formation of
the Monetary Policy Committee provide the institutional foundation for strong monetary policy
credibility. The current monetary policy setting is consistent with inflation remaining within the
RBI’s medium-term inflation target band. However, inflation is likely to remain in the upper half of
the target band over the medium-term, mainly due to food supply constraints and sticky
household inflation expectations. Monetary policy should continue to be supported by fiscal
consolidation and agricultural reform measures to boost food supplies.
55.
The authorities should press ahead with their longer-term objective of substantially
reducing fiscal deficits and the public debt burden. With continued delays in reaching
medium-term deficit targets, India’s public debt ratio is likely to remain high and fiscal policy
space remains limited. Implementation of a robust GST, given its growth enhancing effects, and
further subsidy reforms should be key pillars of the authorities’ fiscal consolidation strategy.
Building on their recent success in fuel subsidy reforms and efforts to enhance financial inclusion,
the authorities should continue to pursue better targeting and greater efficiency of subsidy and
social spending programs through use of direct benefit transfers. To prevent pro-cyclicality of
fiscal policy and safeguard the quality of fiscal adjustment in the future, fiscal consolidation needs
to be accompanied by strengthening of fiscal responsibility and medium-term expenditure and
budget frameworks for both the Union government and the states. In the revised fiscal
responsibility framework, the authorities should consider anchoring the deficit path by a mediumterm public debt target, complemented by a nominal expenditure growth rule. Fiscal
consolidation will enable a gradual phasing-out of financial repression, which will help price
stability and lower the cost of credit for the private sector.
56.
Boosting exports and further enhancing the environment for attracting stable
capital flows are key challenges. India’s external position remains broadly consistent with
fundamentals and the level of international reserves is assessed to be adequate. Nonetheless,
continued vigilance is needed given potential external shocks and global financial market
volatility. Exchange rate flexibility should remain the main shock absorber and could be
accompanied by judicious foreign exchange intervention given India’s increased reserve buffers.
As the external environment remains weak, the need to reduce trade barriers and support trade
liberalization has become even more pressing. Continued efforts to revamp the business climate
remain necessary to attract even greater FDI flows and help ensure the success of the “Make in
India” initiative.
57.
Notwithstanding considerable progress made in the past two years, advancing
structural reforms remains essential for creating jobs and raising growth. Labor market reforms
should be at the top of India’s to-do list, given their ability to enhance the impact of recent product
market reforms, and help increase formal sector employment and the employment of women.
Improvements in infrastructure, including wider sanitation coverage, are key to raising India’s female
labor force participation and potential growth. Strong efforts to improve India’s business climate and
to leverage and empower cross-state regulatory and economic competition will also help raise both

foreign and domestic investment. Finally, much more needs to be done to address long-standing
structural bottlenecks and enhance market efficiency in the agricultural sector, which if successful
would help raise food availability and consumption, enhance returns to farmers, and support
macroeconomic stability by dampening food inflation pressures.

It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard 12month cycle.

Box 1. Currency Withdrawal and Exchange and its Economic Impact1
The Government of India withdrew the legal tender status of all existing Rs 500 and 1000
currency notes effective November 9, 2016, in a bid to nullify “black money” hoarded in cash,
address tax evasion, tackle counterfeiting, and curb financing of terrorism. The initiative affected
notes with a total value of about Rs 15 trillion (about 86 percent of all cash in circulation). Defunct notes
could be deposited in unlimited amounts into bank accounts until end-2016, with large deposits (US$
4000 and above) expected to attract scrutiny of the tax authorities. At the time of the withdrawal, the
roll out of a new series of Rs 500 and 2000 notes was announced, but distribution of new currency notes
has proceeded slowly. Cash exchanges of defunct notes were allowed initially up to Rs 4,500 (US$ 70)
but were later discontinued. Caps have been imposed on cash withdrawals by individuals and
corporations from their bank accounts, while check and electronic payments remain unaffected. As
disruptions to payments arose, several temporary exemptions were granted to ease the cash crunch.
The exemptions aimed at easing transactions in some public offices and for the farming sector, as well
as making payments for public utility services and purchasing key primary products. In this regard, the
success of the initiative also depends on the effective implementation of AML/CFT safeguards,
particularly in the banking sector and the gold market.
Payment transactions in India are primarily cash-based and electronic payments infrastructure is
limited. At end-2015, currency in circulation in India stood at about 12 percent of GDP, one of the

tightening of monetary conditions in the initial weeks of the initiative, which eases as currency is
replaced. Consequently, based on the IMF India Quarterly Projection Model, GDP growth is expected to
slow to about 6 percent in the second half of FY2016/17, before gradually rebounding in the course of

Box 2. Ujwal Discom Assurance Yojana (UDAY):
Debt Restructuring for Power Distribution Companies1
While improvements in fuel supply, electricity generation, and transmission capacity have
occurred in India in recent years, distribution has remained problematic and become the
weak link in the electricity supply chain. Electricity distribution in India occurs primarily through
inefficient and financially troubled state-owned power distribution companies (DISCOMs). The
DISCOMs experience operational losses2 for two main reasons: (i) aggregate technical and
commercial (AT&C) losses, a part of which are losses in the process of transmission and
distribution (T&D), and (ii) electricity tariffs that are low considering the cost of procuring power.
Despite improvement in the past decade, India’s T&D losses, at almost 20 percent of generation,
are among the highest levels of T&D losses in the world. DISCOMs have been funding operational
losses with debt carrying high interest rates, compounding their financial troubles.

In November 2015, the Government of India launched the Ujwal Discom Assurance Yojana,
or UDAY scheme, aimed at turning around the financially stressed and generally inefficient
state-owned DISCOMs.3 At the time, the DISCOMs had together accumulated about Rs 3.8
trillion in losses (3 percent of then-GDP) and Rs 4.3 trillion in debt (3.4 percent of GDP) with
interest rates as high as 15 percent. Financial losses are concentrated in several states, with losses
of the worst seven states accounting for almost 90 percent of total losses.

technical losses refer to losses as power is transmitted through the distribution system, while
commercial losses result from theft of electricity or deficiencies in metering.

3 UDAY

plans a four-pronged approach to helping the DISCOMs recover and become more efficient by: (i)
Improving operational efficiencies of DISCOMs; (ii) Reducing the cost of power; (iii) Reducing the interest cost of
DISCOMs; and (iv) Enforcing financial discipline on DISCOMs by aligning their finances with state finances.

Box 2. Ujwal Discom Assurance Yojana (UDAY):
Debt Restructuring for Power Distribution Companies (Concluded)
The key feature of the scheme is the restructuring of DISCOM debt, whereby states that join
the scheme take over 75 percent of their DISCOMs’ outstanding debt as of September 2015—
50 percent in FY2015/16 and 25 percent in 2016/17—funded by issuing state bonds in the market
or directly to the banks originally holding the DISCOM debt. These ‘UDAY bonds’ would not count
towards states’ FRBMA prescribed borrowing limits of 3 percent of gross state domestic product
(GSDP). For the remaining 25 percent of outstanding DISCOM debt, the holding banks would
convert the debt to loans with lower interest rate, i.e. not more than the bank’s base rate plus 10
basis points. Finally, with respect to the future financial losses of DISCOMs, states would gradually
take over and fund the losses.4 These future losses would count towards the state deficit limits,
thereby giving states incentive to ensure an improvement in operations at DISCOMs to prevent
future financial losses.
A critical mass of states has joined UDAY and restructured the DISCOM debt, relieving the
financial stress of these DISCOMs. As of November 2016, nine states had issued UDAY bonds
amounting to Rs 1,585 billion (or 50 percent of DISCOM debt eligible for the scheme). Six
additional states and one Union territory have signaled their intention to join the scheme, by
signing a tripartite agreement between the Centre, the state government and the DISCOM,
committing to a significant improvement in operations and thus financial performance.5
The focus should now turn to stronger reforms aimed at improving operational efficiency,
which is critical to the success of UDAY. While the DISCOMs have been bailed out by state
governments in the past,6 UDAY places additional focus on improving operational efficiency,
decreasing the cost of purchasing power, and enabling quarterly increases in electricity tariffs.7 In
addition, measures to increase billing efficiency and decrease commercial losses will be necessary.
4 That

is, they would take over 5 percent of the FY2017/18 losses in FY2018/19, 10 percent of the FY2018/19 losses
the following year, 25 percent of the FY2019/20 losses the following year, and 50 percent of the FY2020/21 losses
the following year.

5

In total, the 15 states and Union territory account for almost 60 percent of outstanding DISCOM debt.

The previous Scheme for Financial Restructuring of the State Distribution Companies was launched in October
2012. Under that scheme, DISCOMs were supposed to issue 50 percent of their short-term liabilities as statebacked bonds, which would then be taken over by state government over the next 2-5 years, while remaining
within the borrowing ceilings prescribed by their respective FRBMAs. The remaining 50 percent of the DISCOMs’
short-term liabilities were to be rescheduled by lenders, with the principal and interest backed by state
government guarantees. Eight states, then accounting for the majority of accumulated losses, joined the scheme.
But the debt burden of the DISCOMS was not sufficiently eased as the states did not have enough room to take
over the debt and, in addition, most DISCOMs did not end up meeting the requisite performance criteria.
6

The MoUs discuss states improving operating parameters and raising power tariffs to bring them in line with
costs. As incentive, states that reach certain operational milestones will be offered additional funding to facilitate
augmentation of distribution networks, as well as be supported with additional coal and additional low cost power
from NTPC (the largest electricity generation company) and other central public sector electricity companies.

Box 3. Developing India’s Corporate Bond Market1
India’s corporate bond market has expanded rapidly in recent years but remains a limited
source of funding, with firms relying predominantly on bank credit. The local corporate
securities market, particularly commercial paper (CPs), have been playing a growing role in
corporate funding. Both issuance volumes and issues have expanded considerably, with issuance
volumes roughly doubling to Rs 5.8 billion in the five years to end-FY2016, and outstanding debt
reaching close to 15 percent of GDP at end-FY2016 (Figure). However, domestic debt securities
still account for only about 20 percent of corporate funding (Figure). The market faces various
structural impediments, including: (i) dominance of issuances by financial sector entities; (ii)
prevalence of private placements; (iii) very limited market liquidity; and (iv) restrictions on
institutional-investor allocations to non-investment-grade bonds. Corporate funding has so far
largely been supported by bank credit and external borrowing, which jointly accounted for more
than 80 percent of funding at end-FY2016. However, the relatively high dependence on external
funding exposes Indian corporates to potential debt repayment difficulties. Coupled with credit
supply pressures due to the PSBs’ asset quality problems, the lack of sufficient long-term funding
channels can impair growth and infrastructure development, particularly in view of India’s high
capital funding requirements.2

The growing need to support further corporate bond market development has prompted
the Indian authorities to undertake a comprehensive reform plan. The measures, drafted by
the inter-agency Working Group on Development of Corporate Bond Market in India (chaired by
Deputy Governor Khan of the Reserve Bank of India) and announced in August 2016 entail key
reforms, including: (i) a much needed emphasis on inter-agency coordination in supporting and
regulating the market; (ii) development of key missing markets, including the corporate repo
market; (iii) support for extension of partial credit enhancements (PCEs)—via a considerable
increase in the aggregate bank cap (to 50 percent)—to open avenues for less creditworthy
borrowers to tap markets; (iv) enhancement of market liquidity via the sanctioning of corporate
bond reissuance under the same ISIN and hence higher volumes for secondary trading; (v) steps
towards ensuring uniform valuations; and (vi) rationalization of stamp duties across states.

Box 3. Developing India’s Corporate Bond Market (Concluded)
The plan’s publication has been followed by implementation steps by relevant regulators
(notably RBI and Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI)) to boost incentives for use of
market funding (via an increase of the PCE cap, and introduction of banks’ large exposure limits);
expand market participation (by permitting brokers in the corporate repo market and foreign
investor direct trading in corporate bonds); and introducing and Electronic Dealing Platform in the
corporate repo market). Finally, in a move to ensure market transparency, the National Stock
Exchange of India (NSE) introduced a trade repository of primary- and secondary-market activities
at both over the counter markets and across exchanges.
The new measures would remove key hurdles to the development of the Indian corporate
bond market, but would also require addressing important constraints, including:


High leverage, particularly among large corporates, is likely to dampen issuance, at least in
the short term. The encouragement of corporate funding “through market mechanism” via
the introduction of limits banks’ large exposures under the new measures should shift
funding away from banks and towards the debt market in the medium to long term.
However, a comprehensive strategy of corporate debt restructuring is critical to help
unlock funding demand and spur investment in the economy.



The domestic investor base remains limited and would benefit from better risk transfer
mechanisms. Recent measures on liberalizing restrictions on foreign bond holdings—
including the opening up of foreign portfolio investment (FPI) in unlisted securities under
the authorities’ plan and the easing of FPI investment limits—are conducive to bringing in
much-needed foreign investment. However, domestic insurance companies and pension
funds, typically instrumental in absorbing demand for corporate paper in well-developed
corporate markets, still play a very limited role in the market. Further efforts to develop
better risk transfer mechanisms, including the dormant CDS market, would boost
institutional investors’ incentives to finance riskier corporates.



A successful implementation would benefit from effective cross-agency coordination. Both
the RBI and SEBI have acted swiftly to implement key elements of the new plan. However,
it is important to ensure that all relevant agencies—including the Government of India,
RBI, SEBI, Fixed Income Money Market and Derivatives Association of India (FIMMDA),
Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA), and the Pension Fund
Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA)—follow through and coordinate on
implementation.

successful in enabling women-led businesses to access
finance. Such business accounted for about one-half of the total amount lent under the scheme, and about fourfifths of the number of loans, in part reflecting scheme’s support to new business undertakings led by women.
Staff analysis indicates that increasing access to affordable formal finance can raise output and improve
gender equality. Using a two-sector general equilibrium model incorporating formal and informal sources of
finance, staff estimates show that policies that an increase in womens’ access to formal finance improves gender
equality in entrepreneurship, which in turn boosts female labor force participation and employment, leading to
higher consumption and GDP (see Selected Issues Chapter IX).
While policies should continue to focus on the supply of finance, addressing constraints on the demand
for formal finance should be prioritized. Strengthening financial literacy programs, holding workshops aimed
at building the trust of rural communities with the banking system, and conducting surveys to understand the
costs and barriers to usage of formal financial services, would help promote inclusion. In addition, technologydriven initiatives, spanning know-your-customer, mobile banking, digitalization and greater usage of direct
benefit transfer schemes can help lower transaction costs. The government should measure the success of its
interventions by the extent of reduction in informal employment, the rise in formal entrepreneurship and the
extent of mobility of firms to medium and large sizes.

precluded the center from taxing sales and empowered it with the exclusive right to tax services, a
“grand bargain” between the center and states was necessary to enable taxation of sales by the
center in exchange for a share of GST revenues to the states. This had remained elusive until
August 2016 when the Constitutional Amendment Bill was passed. The Constitution was amended
shortly thereafter, in September 2016, after a majority of state legislatures ratified the Bill and a
GST Council was set-up to draft detailed GST laws. Several steps towards GST implementation,
which the government hopes to introduce by April 2017, now remain. First, detailed GST laws
must be drafted and passed by the Indian Parliament for the center and by each state legislature
for the states. Second, the IT infrastructure needs to be completed and tax officers and industry
professionals trained.
The GST should help secure gains in economic efficiency and growth, with favorable effects
on investment and exports. The GST will replace a plethora of cascading center, state, interstate, and local taxes with a single, nationwide, value-added tax on goods and services. The
destination-based GST will create, for the first time, a single Indian market, and will greatly
enhance India as an investment destination. By subsuming most of the existing indirect taxes,
such as excise, sales and services levies, the indirect tax structure of the country will become less
complex and the cost of doing business will decline. Export competitiveness will rise as logistical
costs fall with the removal of interstate tax-induced trade barriers, the tax system becomes more
efficient, and use is made of input tax credits on cross-state trade. The GST will also raise general
government tax collection, including by fostering compliance and help ensure a decline in the
share of the informal sector. Consequently, it can also support fiscal consolidation efforts which, in
addition to economic efficiency gains, should solidify recent monetary policy strides in achieving
low and stable inflation in the medium-term.
In the steps that remain towards implementing the GST, ensuring a robust design is key.
With the GST Council in place and resolutions reached on the tax brackets, compensation to
states, and turnover thresholds, decisions are still to be made on classification of goods and
services across tax brackets as well as details of exemptions. There are a couple of key
macroeconomic issues to be considered. First, the GST should have uniform cross-state rates, a
simple tax rate structure, and minimal exemptions. With the JAM (Jan Dhan Yojana bank accounts,
Aadhaar identification, mobile banking) trinity in place, the policy focus should be on enhancing
the distributional aspects of fiscal spending that a higher tax rate can enable, rather than
supporting the poor through reduced and potentially distortionary tax rates. Second, key
production inputs, such as energy and real estate, should be kept within the tax base to enable
greater output gains and reduce the tax burden across sectors. Output losses from production
inefficiencies due to cascading embodied in exemptions may be large even under a fairly low
nominal tax rate and with relatively few stages of production.2

Box 6. Key Structural Reform: Economic Impact of Poor Sanitation in India1
India was not able to achieve the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) target of halving the share
of the population without basic sanitation by end-2015. At the national level, the targeted reduction
in this share from 76 percent in 1990 to 38 percent by 2015 was missed by about 11 percentage points.
According to the Census 2011 survey, 53.1 percent (63.6 percent in 2001) of households in India do not
have a toilet, with the percentage being as high as 69.3 percent (78.1 percent in 2001) in rural areas and
18.6 percent (26.3 percent in 2001) in urban areas. However, since water supply and sanitation is a state
responsibility under the Indian Constitution, there is wide variation in sanitation coverage across various
states, where some states did achieve their respective

Box 6. Key Structural Reform: Economic Impact of Poor Sanitation in India (Concluded)
As well, the World Bank’s Water and Sanitation Program
(WSP) has pegged the economic cost of inadequate
sanitation at around 6.4 per cent of India’s GDP in 2006.
Sanitation should be enhanced through infrastructure
investment, as well as promoting health awareness
and facilitating offtake. While sanitation coverage and
infrastructure have been increasing, survey and studies
indicate that the use of existing toilets in both rural and
urban areas remains low. Along with inadequate
infrastructure, cultural and traditional barriers and a lack
of knowledge of health risks have been brought forward
as the prime reasons behind demand side constraints
(NSS 69th round). In this regard, the Swachh Bharat (Clean
India) mission,5 launched in October 2014 alongside
improving sanitation infrastructure, also focuses on fostering large-scale social and behavior change to
increase sanitation demand in both rural and urban India. Since the launch of the program, close to 31
million toilets have been built in rural areas, resulting in a 17.5 percent increase in the number of Indian
rural households with a latrine facility. The relatively large fiscal cost of the Swachh Bharat program
(estimated at about ¼ of one percent of GDP over the next 5 years) have been supported through
introduction of a 0.5 percent special cess on services.6 That said, given the diverse range of cultures,
languages and religion within India means that the role of the central government can be rather limited.
Hence, to enable greater impact, policy interventions should continue to be tailored to communityspecific factors, across particular states and districts.

child due to their ability to economically support parents in old age. This creates a cycle of low
investment in girl’s education and health, hurting their economic opportunities, thus further
reinforcing the skewed preference towards the boy child.3

To reverse the declining CSR numbers, the Beti Bachao Beti
Padhao (Celebrate Girl Child, Enable her Education) scheme was
launched by Prime Minister Modi in January 2015.4 With a modest
budget of Rs 199.99 crore (about US$ 28 million), this scheme,
implemented in 100 selected districts low in CSR in the first phase, aims
to: prevent the practice of sex selection before or after conception
through better implementation of PCPNDT; mobilize local communities

This trend is widespread across both rural and urban areas, where the former fares better with a CSR of 923 girls
per 1000 boys in comparison to 905 in the latter. According to the World Health Organization, a biologically
normal CSR ranges from 943–980 girls per 1000 boys.

and sensitize them to the need for healthier CSRs; promote universal school enrolment; and
reduce the school dropout rates of girl children. This scheme relies on increasing awareness and
better implementation of existing schemes such as Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (Education for All
Movement), Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (National Mission for Secondary Education)
and the Integrated Child Development Scheme to make the initiative a success.5 In addition, a
financial incentive through the small savings scheme—Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana6—whereby an
account in the name of a girl child can be opened (and receive a favorable interest rate of
9.1 percent), is an associated scheme, with the aim of providing financial independence and
insurance to girls when they turn 18 years of age.

impact on the wellbeing of the girl child. Furthermore, a more holistic policy approach oriented
towards higher growth, job creation, and financial inclusion will lead to better sex ratios in the
long run. In addition, reorienting public expenditure towards broadening the social safety net will
reduce the dependence of the old on their children, which will thereby help equalize the
preference for girls and boys.

2016

Marginal Cost of Funds based Lending Rate (MCLR): RBI notified
guidelines for MCLR for commercial banks effective April 1, 2016. MCLR
would replace ‘base rate’ as the new reference point for setting lending rates
for various tenures based on marginal cost of funds (= 92 percent x marginal
cost of borrowings + 8 percent x return on net worth). Banks are now
required to review and publish MCLR on a monthly basis based on changes in
deposit rates, thus supporting quicker transmission of monetary policy moves.
Policy actions:
(i) Reduced repo rate by 25 bps to 6.50 percent from 6.75 percent;
(ii) Narrowed the policy rate corridor from +/-100 bps to +/- 50 bps by
reducing the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate by 75 bps and
increasing the reverse repo rate by 25 bps. Consequently, the reverse
repo rate was adjusted to 6.0 per cent, and MSF rate to 7.0 percent;
(iii) Progressively lower the average ex ante liquidity deficit in the system
from one percent of net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) to a position

notified to reset interest rates on various small savings schemes on a quarterly

concerns of commercial banks’ inability to reduce their deposit rates and help
support monetary policy transmission. Following the notification, interest
rates for various SSS came down significantly.
State fiscal deficit target: The central government accepted Fourteenth
Finance Commission recommendations of a fiscal deficit threshold limit of 3
percent of Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) for the states. This nominal

amendment, the factories will have to ensure adequate safety and security of
their women employees, both within the factory premises and during transit
from workplace to their homes.

Impact

Policies to Minimize Impact

Domestic Risks
Prolonged cash
shortages

M

M: Given the large role of cash in everyday transactions
in the Indian economy, prolonged cash shortages
accompanying the currency exchange initiative can
weigh on economic activity, fiscal revenues, and could
cause a further rise in corporate vulnerabilities and
weaken bank asset quality.

Continue to enhance the supply of new
banknotes, and if needed consider further sectorbased exemptions, including on use of old
banknotes, particularly for rural and remote areas.

Balance sheet risks

M

H: Failure to promptly address bank asset quality
distress through asset resolution and repair of
corporate balance sheets could lead to further bank
and corporate balance sheet deterioration,
undermining capital positions of public sector banks,
reducing lending in the medium term and adversely
affecting the investment recovery.

Strengthen oversight of financial and corporate
risks. Enhance loss-absorbing buffers in public
sector banks. Policies to incentivize corporate
restructuring and implementation of new
insolvency framework.

Setbacks in
structural reform
process

L

M: Difficulty in GST implementation and passing key
bills (Labor Market and Land Acquisition) and slow
progress on reforming factor and product markets,
including agriculture, could weigh on investment and
growth, stoke inflation, and weaken investor sentiment.

Facilitate state-led reform initiatives. Enhance
revenue raising efforts; continue to address longstanding supply bottlenecks through nonlegislative measures; and strengthen the business
climate.

Larger positive
impact from GST
than currently
expected

L

H: Higher growth will help rebuild fiscal space,
facilitate balance sheet repair and investment recovery,
enhance external competiveness and price stability.

Facilitate further structural reforms, particularly to
labor markets. Enhance quality and scope of public
investment. As fiscal deficit decline, consider faster
phasing out of financial repression.

External Risks
Tighter or more
volatile global
financial conditions

M

M: While external vulnerabilities have declined
considerably, the impact from risk re-pricing or a surge
in global financial market volatility could be very
disruptive, particularly against the backdrop of recent
large capital inflows, maturing FCNR deposits, sluggish
exports, and weak corporate balance sheets.

Enhance the environment for attracting stable
non-debt creating capital flows, particularly FDI.
Rupee flexibility and monetary policy tightening.
Given adequate level of international reserves,
provide foreign currency liquidity to prevent
disorderly movements in the exchange rate.

Weaker-than
expected global
growth

M

M: Deterioration of economic outlook in key advanced
and emerging market countries would cloud the
sustainability of the recovery in India, both for exports
and investment.

Structural reform will raise returns to investment,
strengthen domestic sources of growth, and
support export competitiveness.

Increased volatility
of global energy
prices

M

M: Significant effects on the current account deficit,
inflation. While volatility in energy prices can have an
adverse impact, persistently-low energy prices are
beneficial for India given its net energy importer status.

Improve targeting of transfers to shelter the most
vulnerable; accelerate reform of remaining fuel
subsidies; smooth volatility of domestic fuel
prices through fiscal measures; provide dollar
liquidity to oil marketing companies as required,
to address disruptive exchange rate volatility.

Rising regional
geopolitical tensions

L

M: Financial market pressure, reduced capital inflows,
and general tightening of financial conditions.

Strengthen oversight of financial and corporate
risks. Rupee flexibility. Given adequate level of
international reserves, provide foreign currency
liquidity to prevent disorderly movements in the
exchange rate.

Annex III. India: Public and External Debt Sustainability Analysis
India’s public debt remains sustainable given manageable interest rate costs and robust growth
outlook. 1 Under the baseline, assuming gradual fiscal consolidation and implementation of the
national Goods and Services Tax, the public debt-to-GDP ratio is forecast to decline gradually to
around 61 percent of GDP in the medium term from the current level of almost 70 percent, with
gross financing needs also declining slightly to about 10 percent of GDP in 2021/22. Negative
growth shocks represent one of the major risks to the debt outlook. In addition, realization of
contingent liabilities coming from future bank recapitalization needs and further taking-on of the
liabilities of the electricity distribution companies may also push the debt trajectory up above the
70 percent benchmark, before the debt-to-GDP ratio declines gradually in the medium term. On
the other hand, the captive domestic investor base is likely to mitigate the impact of any real
interest rate shocks. India’s external debt, currently at 23½ percent of GDP, remains sustainable.
1.

India’s public debt sustainability analysis is based on the following assumptions:



Macroeconomic assumptions. Growth is forecast to slow to 6.6 percent (at market
prices) in 2016/17 due temporary disruptions caused by cash shortages, and then
rebound to 7.2 percent in FY2017/18, gradually rising to slightly over 8 percent in the
medium term. The upward revision to medium-term real GDP growth of about 0.4
percentage points stems from implementation of the recently passed national Goods and
Services tax,2 with CPI inflation projected to remain around 5 percent through 2021/22. In
addition, nominal GDP growth is expected to revert from an average of 9.7 percent
during 2014/15–2015/16 to an average of 12.5 percent during the next five years, in large
part due to a projected pick-up in GDP deflator.3 This baseline scenario assumes a
gradual global economic recovery scenario as outlined in the WEO.



Fiscal Assumptions. The 2015/16 central government fiscal deficit came in at 3.9 percent
of GDP (in line with the authorities’ deficit target of 3.9 percent of GDP), which
corresponds to 4.1 percent under the Fund’s definition. Over the medium term, the
central government’s fiscal deficit (as per IMF definition) is expected to decline slowly
toward 3.0 percent of GDP, while state government deficits should decline to about
2.5 percent of GDP. Staff projections (which are based on current policies and assume no
additional major legislative changes) imply that the central government will
underperform against its fiscal adjustment targets.

1
The analysis of public debt sustainability is based on the framework developed for market access countries. See
Staff Guidance Note for Public Debt Sustainability Analysis in Market Access Countries, IMF, May 2013.
2
Growth-enhancing channels of GST are multiple, such as reducing cascading of taxes and creating a single
national market, enhancing the efficiency of intra-Indian movement of goods and service, and boosting
competitiveness of the Indian exports. The growth impact assumption is on the lower end of medium-term
growth boost experienced in other countries.

Reflecting unwinding of base effects of the collapse in global commodity prices. For details see 2016 Article IV
Staff Report, Box 1. Oil Price Collapse: Impact on Indian Inflation.

o

Tax performance, especially for income taxes, is expected to increase slightly as
ongoing administrative measures continue to be implemented and base broadening
is expected to continue. Introduction of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) is assumed
to entail a revenue neutral rate.

o

At the same time, while savings from reduced fuel subsidies have already been
realized as diesel prices have been deregulated, the planned gradual introduction of
cash transfers should help rationalize spending over the medium term. However, the
Food Security Act and fertilizer subsidies will keep the subsidy bill high.

o

Public banks are expected to be recapitalized to reach Basel III targets (baseline
assumes ¼ of one percent of FY2018/19 GDP cumulative over the next three years).
Recent announcements indicate state governments have taken on a large portion of
the debt of electricity distribution companies (around 1.1 percent of GDP) since the
roll-out of the UDAY scheme in November 2015, which is the key reason behind an
upward revision to 2015/16 and 2016/17 debt ratios compared to the 2016 Article IV
Staff Report. The contingent liabilities shock scenario incorporates state governments
assuming an additional 1 percent of GDP of power distribution companies’ debt,
which corresponds to the maximum remaining eligible amount, and 3 percent for
banking sector recapitalization.

2.
Under the baseline projection, India’s debt ratio and gross financing needs will stay
on a declining path from 2017/18. India’s primary deficit is projected to trend downward and
remain below its debt-stabilizing threshold (estimated at 3.1 percent of GDP based on the
2021/22 projections) in the projection years. Therefore, gross financing needs are expected to
remain at slightly below 12 percent of GDP in 2016/17 before gradually declining to about
10 percent in 2021/22. Automatic debt dynamics arising from the interest rate-growth
differential will on average reduce the debt ratio by close to 2⅔ percentage points per year from
2016/17 to 2021/22, in part due to low real interest rates on public debt as a result of financial
repression (through the SLR). As a result, the public debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to fall from
about 69.8 percent in 2015/16 to 60.9 percent in 2021/22. The 2020/21 public debt-to-GDP ratio
is about 1½ percentage points higher than the last Staff Report, reflecting an upward data
revision of the historical public debt path and state government taking on of electricity
distribution companies’ debt. Notably, higher projected nominal GDP growth, as a result of the
growth-enhancing effects of GST, underpins the growth driver of favorable debt dynamics.
3.
India faces relatively low risks to debt sustainability under the baseline, but could
be vulnerable to slower real GDP growth and a contingent liability shock. The heat map
suggests that the debt burden benchmark and the gross financing needs threshold are exceeded
under a contingent liability shock. A contingent liability shock (which could arise from losses at

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

73

INDIA

public banks and debt restructuring of electricity distribution companies)4 pushes the debt-toGDP ratio to around 75 percent in 2017/18 and 2018/19. A one-standard deviation shock to real
GDP growth increases the debt-to-GDP ratio to about 72¼ percent in 2018/19. Both shocks,
however, do not change the downward debt trajectory in the medium term. Lack of fiscal
adjustment is another principal risk to debt sustainability in India’s context. An unchanged
primary balance would slow the debt reduction in the near term. Finally, the combined macrofiscal shock also has a large level effect but does not change the direction of the debt trajectory.
As a result, the asymmetric fan chart suggests that upside risks to debt ratio dominate in the
medium term. Overall, risks are mitigated by the fact that most of the public debt is financed
through a captive domestic investor base, the very small external debt is mostly from official
creditors, and adequate international reserves are available in the rare case that external
financing needs arise. Risks that could improve India’s public debt sustainability include better
tax buoyancy, a better-than expected GST impact on growth, and a new Direct Tax Code
(including improvements in tax administration) that improve efficiency and lead to near-term
revenue gains. A stronger revival of the economy could also return India to the debt dynamics
prevailing before the global financial crisis.
4.
There is no evidence of a systematic projection bias in the baseline assumptions
and the projected fiscal adjustment is in line with other countries’ experiences. India’s
forecast track record exceeds that of most surveillance countries, with percentile ranks in excess
of 90 (for real GDP growth) and 77 (for primary balance). India’s projected fiscal adjustment (an
improvement of around three-quarters of one percentage point in cyclically-adjusted primary
balance/GDP over the medium term) is modest and should be achievable. This magnitude of
adjustment is also in line with other countries’ experiences, with a three-year adjustment in
cyclically-adjusted primary balance at the 44th percentile among all surveillance countries with
market access. The boom-bust analysis is not triggered because India had a negative output gap
in 2015/16.

4
The contingent liabilities shock is customized to reflect: (i) the central government bearing the full cost of PSBs’
recapitalization in a severe stress scenario (about 3 percent of GDP), and (ii) state governments assuming 75
percent of the remaining debt of the electricity distribution companies that may become eligible for restructuring
(about 1 percent of GDP).

Annex IV. External Sector Assessment
Staff assesses that India’s external position in FY2015/16 was broadly consistent with medium-term
fundamentals and desirable policy settings.
Current Account and Exchange Rates
The current account (CA) deficit narrowed further in FY2015/16, to 1.1 percent of GDP, helped by
lower commodity-import prices, and is projected to remain contained at about 1.1 percent of
GDP in FY2016/17. As of November 2016, the real effective exchange rate (REER) has been
broadly stable, appreciating by 1½ percent over the average REER in FY2015/16.
The External Balance Assessment (EBA) CA regression estimates a norm of -4.2 percent of GDP
for India in FY2015/16. However, in staff’s judgment, global financial markets could not be
counted on to reliably finance a deficit of that size, in light of India’s current vulnerabilities. Given
the risks with global financial market volatility, staff assesses that a smaller CA deficit of about
2¼ percent of GDP is a more appropriate norm.1 The underlying CA in FY2015/16, which is the
CA adjusted for temporary factors,2 is estimated to be -1.75 percent of GDP. Thus, staff assesses
the CA gap to be about ½ percent of GDP, or in a range of -½ to +1½ percent of GDP.
The EBA Index REER and Level REER regression approaches estimate an overvaluation of about 8
and 13 percent for the 2015 average REER, respectively. In addition, the staff assessed CA gap
implies an undervaluation of 2½ percent for the FY2015/16 average REER. Overall, staff assesses
the REER to be moderately overvalued, with the REER gap in a range of -5 to +10 percent.
Capital Account Flows and International Investment Position
India’s financial account is dominated by portfolio equity and FDI flows. FDI flows as a share of
GDP have been increasing since 2014/15, as the authorities have liberalized the caps on FDI in
most sectors. Debt flows, particularly in the form of external commercial borrowings (ECB) by
Indian corporates, have stabilized after increasing in recent years. After large net portfolio flows
in 2014/15, amid easy global financial conditions, portfolio flows were moderately negative in
2015/16. Given that portfolio debt flows have been volatile and the exchange rate has been
sensitive to these flows and changes in global risk aversion, attracting more stable sources of
financing would reduce vulnerabilities.

1

See 2016 External Sector Report, IMF Policy Paper, July 27, 2016. The CGER-type external sustainability method
estimates the CAD norm at about 2¼ percent of GDP given medium-term growth and inflation projections,
assuming the NFA is stabilized at about 20 percent of GDP. See IMF (2014), India: Staff Report for 2014 Article IV
Consultation, IMF Country Report No. 14/57 for additional model-based estimates and description of the CA
deficit norm in India. Compared to the previous estimate of the CAD norm of about 2½ percent of GDP, the
estimated norm declined slightly due largely to the lower medium-term projected nominal growth.

The estimated underlying CA here incorporates the EBA-estimated cyclical adjustment and also takes account of
the temporary impact of higher tariffs on gold imports as well as the temporary part of the recent terms of trade
gain (about ½ of one percent of GDP).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

INDIA

India’s net international investment position (NIIP) has been stable, at around 17½ percent of
GDP in recent years and is projected to increase slightly over the medium-term, driven
predominantly by FDI and portfolio inflows.
India’s external debt, at 23 percent of GDP as at end-June 2016, remains moderate when
compared to other emerging market economies. Moreover, the maturity profile of external debt
is favorable as the share of long-term external debt in total debt is over 80 percent and the ratio
of short-term external debt to foreign exchange (FX) reserves is low. With a CAD of about
2 percent of GDP projected for the medium term and higher GDP growth, the NIIP-to-GDP ratio
is expected to remain broadly stable.
Reserve Adequacy
International reserves, at around US$360 billion as of late-December 2016, are adequate to cover
a broad set of risks, based on the different reserve adequacy metrics and in comparison with its
peers. Assessment of reserve adequacy should also take into account a central bank’s other
external buffers, such as forward FX liquidity positions and bilateral/multilateral swap lines. The
Reserve Bank of India (RBI) purchased about US$11 billion in spot and forward markets from
April to September 2016. As at end-September 2016, the net outstanding forward FX purchases
of the RBI stood at about US$5 billion. The net forward position at end-September 2016 was
negligible at negative US$38 million. RBI’s reserve holdings, net of forwards, compares favorably
with other EMs (see right chart). Regarding other lines of defense, Brazil, Russia, India, China and
South Africa (BRICS) have a Contingent Reserve Arrangement (CRA) with US$100 billion in
committed resources. In addition, the RBI is available to provide liquidity to the region through
the SAARC Swap Arrangement, with an overall amount of US$2 billion (the amount available to
each member central bank is broadly based on two months of import cover subject to a
maximum of US$400 million per country). Additional RBI bilateral currency swap lines exist with
the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, in the amount of US$700 million, and the Royal Monetary
Authority of Bhutan, in the amount of US$100 million.

Annex V. Expenditure Reforms1
The relationship between fiscal policy and growth is often explored as a dynamic multiplier of the
quantum of expenditure and/or as the crowding-in crowding-out adjunct of the debt
sustainability framework which governs the operation of fiscal rules. An aspect that is often
forgotten is that efficiency and effectiveness of expenditure, is an even more powerful
determinant of growth that needs systemic attention of policy makers.
Over the last two years, the Government of India has made a significant progress in this regard.
Important dimensions of this achievement are summarized below:


Rationalization of Schemes: Over the past few decades the number of expenditure
schemes and sub-schemes had multiplied inexorably, leading to fragmentation of cost
centres, dis-economies of scale and poor outcomes. In consultation with the Central
Implementing Ministries and Sub-group of Chief Ministers constituted by the NITI Aayog,
schemes, sub-schemes and their components (with shared or common outcomes) were
consolidated and brought together under a rationalized scheme architecture that brings
economics of scale and a greater focus on the achievement of outcomes. As a result of this
exercise the number of Centrally Sponsored Schemes (which are implemented through the
State Governments) has been brought down from 66 to 30, while the number of Central
Sector Schemes (implemented by the agencies authorized by the Central Government) has
been brought down from 1059 to 230.



Cost Center Approach: The Expenditure Budget essentially consists of cost centres, the most
prominent being the Establishments, the Schemes and the Projects. Plan Budgeting was
initiated with the avowed objective of placing a greater focus on the growth-oriented cost
centers. However, over the years, the plan non-plan distinction became so embedded in the
budgetary and accounting framework that most natural cost centres became fragmented.
With the decision to remove the plan non-plan distinction at the end of the Twelfth Five-Year
Plan (2016–17 is the last year), a more cohesive, cost centre approach, with clear revenuecapital distinction, has been adopted and guidance notes have been issued to all concerned.



Appraisal and Approval Protocols: The growth impact of fiscal policy is a function of the
efficiency with which schemes and projects are formulated, appraised and approved. The first
move in this direction was a three-fold increase in the delegation of financial powers in
August, 2014. The second critical reform was simplification of appraisal and approval
protocols in August, 2016, whereby a complex web of serial circulars and annexures, which
had evolved over the past four decades, was replaced by a single master circular (running
into only five pages, with five annexures) that has greatly simplified the appraisal and
approval protocols in accordance with the cost centre approach outlined above.



Quality of Expenditure: Studies have shown that multipliers for infrastructure investment in
India, at the present stage of its development, are significantly higher (1.5 to 2.0) than the
multipliers for revenue expenditure and transfers (0.90 to 1.00). Concerted efforts have been
made by the Government of India to improve Cap-Ex spending over the last two years.
The budgetary support to growth is a sum of direct plan capital expenditure and the grantsin-aid for capital expenditure given to both central agencies and the State Governments.

What matters for growth is the sustained increase in the sum of these two expenditures. The
following exposition describes these expenditures in recent years:
The sum of these two elements increased from Rs 2,35,807 crore in 2014–15 (actuals) to
Rs 2,74,197 crore (revised estimates) in 2015-16 (which is a y-o-y increase of 16.2 percent in
2015-16 over 2014–15). Further, despite the ongoing fiscal consolidation, it increased to
Rs 3,13,322 crore in 2016–17 (budget estimates), which is a y-o-y increase of 14.2 percent in
2016-17 over 2015–16.
An additional support to growth comes from the internal and extra-budgetary resources of
public enterprises and autonomous bodies. After a 12.9 percent fall in 2014–15, this
investment also recovered with a 40.4 percent increase in 2015-16, and is likely to further
increase by 23.8 percent in 2016-17.


Public Financial Management System: What started as a plan scheme monitoring system,
has, over the past two years, been extended to the entire universe of schemes and projects,
as well as to establishment expenditures on the non-plan side. On the revenue side, it has
been suitably integrated with the operational tax portals, and a non-tax revenue portal has
been added to ensure all non-tax revenues are fully taken into account through the public
financial management system.
To bring in just-in-time cash management practices, all implementing agencies of the Central
Sector Schemes, have been asked to register and adopt the Expenditure-Advance-Transfer
(EAT) Modules of the Public Financial Management System by March, 2017. Simultaneously,
the States are being encouraged to design integrated financial management information
systems of their own and link them to the Central Public Financial System to bring-in
efficiencies at the State level, in the execution of the both State and Centrally Sponsored
Schemes.



Direct Benefit Transfer: Another important milestone is the establishment of the Direct
Benefit Transfer (DBT) Gateway through the National Payment Corporation of India (NPCI).
As many as 74 central entitlement schemes/sub-schemes have already moved to this
platform. Enactment of a new Aadhaar Law in March, 2016 has enabled linking of
entitlements and subsidies to biometric authentication of the intended beneficiaries. Since
September 2010, over 1084 million Aadhaar numbers have been generated, covering more
than 90 percent of the adult (over 18 years) population in the country. A State DBT
mechanism has been set-up through the NPCI and the State Governments are increasingly
taking advantage of this critical expenditure reform to improve the targeting of their own
entitlement and subsidy schemes.



Outcome-Evaluation Framework: Last but not the least, all schemes and projects will now
have a medium-term expenditure and outcome framework, which will be formulated in
consultation with the Implementing Ministries and the NITI Aayog. This will be placed before
the Parliament through a consolidated Outcome Budget each year. Each Scheme will have a
start and a sunset date, coterminous with the Finance Commission cycle over which both the
Central and the State Governments have clarity over flow of resources. Third party evaluation
has been formally built into the appraisal and approval framework to ensure periodic
feedback, a more concerted focus on outcomes, and an enhanced overall effect on growth.

Exchange Rate Arrangement:
As per the Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions (AREAER), the
exchange rate in India is classified as floating. The exchange rate of the rupee is determined in the
interbank market, where the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) intervenes at times. The RBI’s role is to
modulate excessive volatility so as to maintain orderly conditions. On August 20, 1994, India
accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the IMF Articles of Agreement. India
maintains the following restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current
international transactions, which are subject to Fund approval under Article VIII, Section 2(a):
restrictions related to the nontransferability of balances under the India-Russia debt agreement;
restrictions arising from unsettled balances under inoperative bilateral payments arrangements with
two Eastern European countries; and a restriction on the transfer of amortization payments on loans
by non-resident relatives. The Executive Board has not approved these restrictions.
Article IV Consultation:
The previous Article IV consultation discussions were held in December 2015. The Staff Report (IMF
Country Report No. 16/75) and associated Selected Issues (IMF Country Report No. 16/76) were
discussed by the Executive Board on February 12, 2016.
FSAP Participation and ROSCs:
The pilot FSSA/FSAP report was issued in January 2001; a fiscal transparency ROSC was issued in
February 2001 (http://www.imf.org/external/np/rosc/ind/fiscal.htm); the data model of the ROSC
(Country Report No. 04/96) was issued in April 2004. The missions for the FSAP Update took place in
2011, and concluding meetings were held in Delhi and Mumbai in January 2012—the FSSA Update
report was published in January 2013 (Country Report No. 13/8). Detailed assessment reports on
FSAP-related papers were issued in August 2013 and published as Country Reports No. 13/265–268.
An FSAP Update is currently underway, and involves missions in December 2016 and April and June
of 2017.

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
In the World Bank Group’s FY16 (July 1, 2015–June 30, 2016), IBRD/IDA lending in India totaled
US$3.8 billion (of which US$2.8 billion IBRD and US$1 billion IDA). IFC committed US$1.15 billion in
FY16, bring the committed portfolio to US$5.2 billion. The World Bank Group’s (WBG) Country
Partnership Strategy (CPS) for India for 2013-20171 focuses on helping India accelerate poverty
reduction and boost shared prosperity, and is closely aligned the Government’s 12th Five-Year Plan,
and its goal of “faster, sustainable, and more inclusive growth.” The volume of WBG support—from
IBRD, IDA, and IFC—has been around US$5 billion annually over the past three years of the CPS.
Under its Strategy, the WBG aims to contribute to India’s development by deepening and
strengthening engagement in three priority areas: integration, rural-urban transformation and
inclusion. “Integration” seeks to increase market integration by focusing on addressing infrastructure
gaps and investment climate as key measures needed to help low-income states converge more
quickly with their faster-growing neighbors. With 600 million people expected to live in India’s cities
by 2031, “rural-urban transformation” will require intensified engagement to improve the
management and livability of medium-sized cities. “Inclusion” will entail a stronger focus on human
development with improvements in healthcare systems and nutrition, on the quality of education at
all levels, as well as on better access to finance and social protection for the underprivileged. A
common theme across these three areas of engagement will be an emphasis on improved
governance, sustainability, and gender equality.
The WBG program in India is particularly focused on increasing support to 14 low-income and
formerly special category states2 (LSS). The Bank is working with the Government to rebalance its
lending portfolio to increase IBRD/IDA lending towards these states, which together account for 61.5
percent of India’s 270 million people living in poverty. As of the end of 2016, nearly 22% of all
commitments are towards LSS, against a CPS target of 30% by the end of FY 2017. Many of these
states also have human development indicators—high infant mortality, high child malnutrition, low
female literacy—on par with the poorest countries in the world. The IFC’s LSS investment portfolio
covers a broad range of sectors, complemented its advisory services. Engagement in more advanced
states and at the central level will focus on activities that are transformative and innovative.
Urbanization presents tremendous opportunities, both for agriculture and poverty reduction, and
competitiveness. WBG support focuses on government efforts at the national, state and city levels to
help improve the livability of medium-sized cities.
A robust knowledge portfolio complements and underpins financing and includes: (i) focus on indepth analytical work on key cross-sectoral questions; (ii) inform design and implementation of
future interventions by drawing on impact evaluations; (iii) respond quickly and flexibly with
demand-driven technical assistance and just-in-time knowledge support to help reform and

These states include: Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, and eight
northeast states (Assam, Himachal Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Sikkim, and Uttarakhand). IFC excludes
Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand. Following recommendations of the 14th Finance Commission, the Special States
category is no longer used as a designation by the Government of India.

implementation; (iv) broker South-South and across-state knowledge exchanges; (v) develop flexible
programmatic approaches to develop analytic and advisory activities; and (vi) scale-up training
capacity. The Advisory Services and Analytical (ASA) program has been strategically realigned to
enhance the implementation of the CPS and its contribution to the twin goals of poverty reduction
and shared prosperity. A clustered approach enables WBG teams to work on multi-sectoral
development challenges in areas such as poverty and shared prosperity, water, urban, service
delivery, human development outcomes, public-private partnerships, social inclusion and gender
and economic integration.
The India Performance and Learning Review (PLR)3—the mid-term assessment of the Strategy—
noted that the India program has been scaled up over the last three years and is being delivered in
the context of a strengthened partnership between the Government of India and WBG. In particular,
stressing the importance of WBG as the “Knowledge Bank”, Prime Minister Modi and President Kim
agreed to scale up support in six strategic priority areas of engagement. Cutting-edge, global
knowledge and financing is being mobilized from across the “One World Bank Group” to help:
rejuvenate the Ganga; develop smart cities and improve urban service delivery; improve rural
sanitation and end open defecation; provide 24/7 electricity to all, including an ambitious push on
solar energy; and provide youth with training and skills development. The Bank Group will also scale
up engagement to help modernize India’s massive railway system and improve India’s business
climate. Finally, over the remainder of the CPS period more emphasis will also be placed on
addressing India’s high malnutrition rates and helping to create opportunities for greater economic
and social inclusion of people belonging to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and women.

RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
The Asian Development Bank (AsDB) operations in India began in 1986. Cumulative public sector
loan commitments totaled US$35.1 billion as of 30 September 2016 for 205 loans. With an
additional US$4.2 billion in private sector loans (the latter without government guarantee), total loan
commitments on a cumulative basis amount to US$39.3 billion. These funds have been provided
from AsDB’s ordinary capital resources (OCR). Also, AsDB has approved equity investments
amounting to US$0.5 billion. AsDB’s lending and equity activities are summarized below.

AsDB assistance supports the Government of India's development priorities, evolving focus areas,
and flagship initiatives. The India country partnership strategy (CPS), 2013–2017 provides the
overarching framework for AsDB’s operations in India. The CPS objective is to help India achieve
faster, more inclusive, and sustainable growth. In line with the government’s guiding principle that
multilateral development partners add value beyond tangible investments, AsDB leverages
knowledge, supports capacity development, and incorporates innovation and best practice into its
operations. To support the government’s vision of “faster, more inclusive, and sustainable growth,”
the CPS has as its key areas infrastructure development, job creation and access to jobs, regional
connectivity, environmental sustainability, and enhancement of synergies across sectors. The CPS is
delivered through AsDB assistance in the energy, transport, urban services, and agriculture and
natural resources sectors—with crosscutting support from finance and public sector management,
as well as human development.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
General: Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance. However, weaknesses remain
in the timeliness and coverage of certain statistical series. India has an intricate system for compiling
economic and financial statistics and produces a vast quantity of data covering most sectors of the
economy. India subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination Standards (SDDS) on
December 27, 1996 and started posting its metadata on the Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board
on October 30, 1997. It is currently in observance of the SDDS, although it uses flexibility options for
timeliness of data on general government operations and on the periodicity and timeliness of labor
market data.
2.
The data module of the Report on Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC, IMF Country
Report No. 04/96) was published in April 2004. It assesses India’s data dissemination practices
against the SDDS requirements and assesses the quality of six datasets based on the Data Quality
Assessment Framework (DQAF) developed by STA.
3.
National accounts and employment statistics: In January 2015 the Central Statistical
Office (CSO) released a new series of national accounts, with base year 2011/12. In addition to the
shift in the base year for measuring growth, the revisions reflected a review of source data and
compilation methods, and implementation of 2008 SNA. Due to weaknesses in estimating taxes less
subsidies on products in constant prices, and as supply-side data remain of better quality than
expenditure-side data, Gross Value Added is preferred as a proxy for measuring economic growth.
For current price estimates, the data sources provide adequate coverage of economic activities, and
the methodology is broadly consistent with international standards and best practices. Nonetheless,
a sales-tax-based extrapolation of trade turnover value from the base year does not provide an
accurate gauge of growth of economy-wide value added from trade. Constant price estimates of
GDP deviate from the conceptual requirements of the national accounts, in part because the
Wholesale Price Index (WPI) is used to derive volume estimates for many economic activities. The
WPI is not the price counterpart for GDP by type of activity because the WPI includes some product
taxes whereas GDP by activity does not include product taxes. Therefore, the WPI can be influenced
by changes in tax rates. Further, the WPI weights include imports but the prices for the index are
collected only on domestic goods. Large revisions to historical series, the relatively short time span
of the revised series, and major discrepancies between GDP by activity and GDP by expenditure
complicate analysis. The current index of industrial production (base year 2004/05) has limited
usefulness for compiling national accounts statistics as its weights are over ten years old and thus its
use may lead to some bias in estimates. There are long-standing deficiencies in employment data:
they only cover the formal sector, which accounts for a small segment of the labor market, and are
available only with a substantial lag.
4.
Price statistics: A revised all-India Consumer Price Index (CPI) with new weights was
released in early 2011, which covers combined rural and urban India, with 2009/10 as a base year. As
well, separate corresponding urban and rural CPI series are published. The CPIs are published with a
lag of about one month. In early 2015, the CPI weights were updated using 2011/12 expenditure

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

INDIA

data and the CPI series has been revised from January 2015. Since January 2006, the Labour Bureau
has published a CPI for industrial workers with a 2001 base year. Presently, there also remain four
CPIs, each based on the consumption basket of a narrow category of consumers (namely industrial
workers, urban and non-manual employees, agricultural laborers, and rural laborers). With the
exception of the industrial workers’ CPI, these other indices are based on weights that are over ten
years old. The WPI has a 2004/05 base year, for which data are also subject to frequent and large
revision, usually upward. A new series of the WPI, also using 2011/12 base year, are likely to be
released in early 2017. The authorities have been encouraged to develop a Producer Price Index to
replace the WPI. New RBI price series on residential property price indexes have helped surveillance
in this area, though geographic coverage remains limited, and price data for commercial real estate
are not available. The RBI has started producing a series covering rural wage data, which helps
surveillance, but economy-wide wage data are scant.
5.
Government finance statistics: The Ministry of Finance (MoF) is responsible for compiling
and disseminating the GFS. At present, India does not report fiscal data to STA. India disseminates
the budgetary central government cash flow statement within one month after the reference month
and stock of liabilities within one quarter after the reference quarter. With the agreement of the
authorities, STA uses these data to compile a monthly cash flow statement for publication in the
International Financial Statistics, following the GFSM 2001/2014 summary presentation, with some
missing breakdowns, particularly for expenditure. Data on fiscal performance at the state level are
available only at annual frequency and with a considerable lag. Data on the functional and economic
classification of expenditures are available with considerable lag. There is also scope to improve the
analytical usefulness of the presentation of the fiscal accounts. For example, classification of
government expenditure between developmental/nondevelopmental and plan/nonplan obscures
the economic nature and impact of fiscal actions. The MoF reports central government data (on a
cash basis) for publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook (GFSY), the latest reported
data corresponding to 2013. Two years after the reference year, the Ministry of Finance reports
general government (Central and State government) data to STA in the GFSM 1986 format, that staff
reworks to the GFSM 2001 presentation for inclusion in the GFSY (latest reported data correspond to
2008). Data on the general government operations are not internationally comparable as they
exclude data on the operations of the extra-budgetary funds, local governments, and social security
funds. Under the SDDS, India disseminates annual general government data within 3 quarters after
the reference year, using the timeliness flexibility option. India meets the SDDS specifications for
central government debt and operations.
6.
Monetary and financial statistics: The RBI web site and the RBI Bulletin publish a wide
array of monetary and financial statistics, including reserve money and its components, RBI’s survey,
monetary survey, liquidity aggregates (outstanding amounts), interest rates, exchange rates, foreign
reserves, and results of government securities auctions. In 2011, the RBI started publishing a
weighted average lending interest rate and other lending rates at annual frequency. The frequency
and quality of data dissemination have improved substantially in recent years.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

INDIA

7.
Concepts and definitions used by the RBI to compile monetary statistics are in broad
conformity with the guidelines provided in the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM).
Nevertheless, the following concepts and principles deviate from the MFSM. First, the resident sector
data do not provide sufficient information on the sectoral distribution of domestic credit.
Specifically, under their present sectorization scheme, the authorities subdivide the resident
nonbank sector data by (i) central government; (ii) state government; and (iii) the commercial sector
(including other financial corporations, public and other nonfinancial corporations, and other
resident sectors). Second, commercial banks add accrued interest to credit and deposit positions on
a quarterly basis only (instead of the prescribed monthly basis).
8.
The RBI reports monetary data for IFS with long delays and in non-standard format. As of
December 12, 2016, the latest monetary statistics published in IFS refer to April 2016. In addition,
data reported cover depository corporations only, i.e. other financial corporations such as insurance
corporations, pension funds, investment funds, etc. are not covered in the data disseminated in IFS.
As for reporting of financial soundness indicators (FSIs), all 12 core and 11 encouraged FSIs for
deposit takers are reported on a quarterly basis. FSIs for other financial corporations, nonfinancial
corporations, and households are not reported.
9.
External sector statistics: The concepts and definitions used to compile balance of
payments statistics are broadly in line with the sixth edition of the Balance of Payments and
International Investment Position Manual (BPM6). However, trade data have valuation, timing, and
coverage problems. Data on imports of goods in balance of payments are registered in c.i.f. prices
while the BPM6 requires the f.o.b. pricing. Data on trade in goods prices, volumes, and composition
are not regularly available on a timely basis. External debt statistics are available on a quarterly basis
with a one quarter lag. Estimates of short-term external debt are presented on an original maturity
basis. The short-term maturity attribution on a residual maturity basis is only available annually (and
excludes residual maturity of medium- and long-term nonresident Indian accounts). The
international investment position (IIP) statistics cover the sectors prescribed in the BPM6 and these
data are disseminated within three months of the reference period in respect of quarterly data.4
Coverage of direct investment positions data is hampered by the absence of appropriate legal or
institutional authority. India disseminates monthly the Data Template on International Reserves and
Foreign Currency Liquidity as prescribed under the SDDS. More up-to-date information on certain
variables, such as total foreign reserve assets, foreign currency assets, gold, and SDRs, are available
on a weekly basis and are disseminated as part of a weekly statistical supplement on the RBI web
site.

The IIP as published by the RBI values equity liabilities at acquisition cost, while the Fund uses market prices,
resulting in substantial differences.

Statement by the Staff Representative on India
Executive Board Meeting
January 25, 2017
This statement contains information that has become available since the staff report was circulated to the
Executive Board. This information does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
1.
India’s Central Statistical Office (CSO) released an advance estimate of real GDP growth
for FY2016/17 (April-March) at 7.1 percent, down from 7.6 percent in FY2015/16. This advance
estimate, which was produced for use in the forthcoming FY2017/18 Budget, only captures data
through October and thus does not include the impact from the currency exchange initiative (which
commenced on November 8, 2016). In late February the CSO will release GDP data for the third
quarter (October-December, 2016) of FY2016/17, which will include the effects of the currency
exchange initiative.
2.
The replacement of currency notes is proceeding gradually. The latest official data released
by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) suggests that as of December 19, 2016, currency notes worth about
38 percent (Rs 5.93 billion) of the value of the demonetized currency notes have been reissued. At the
same time, over 80 percent of the old currency notes (Rs 12.44 billion) have been deposited into bank
accounts. On January 16, 2017, the RBI increased the daily withdrawal limits for ATMs from Rs 4,500
to Rs 10,000, and the weekly withdrawal limit for current accounts from Rs 50,000 to Rs 100,000.
3.
High frequency indicators generally confirm a significant slowdown in activity following the
announcement of the currency exchange initiative. The index of industrial production rose by
5.7 percent in November 2016, but was driven mainly by volatile components, while the orders-toinventory ratio contracted. After a sharp contraction in November, PMIs remained depressed in December
(PMI for services at 46.3; PMI for manufacturing at 48.6). Bank credit growth has continued to decelerate,
falling to a decadal low of 5.1 percent at end-December. Amid subdued domestic demand, CPI inflation
softened further to 3.4 percent (year-over-year) in December from 3.6 percent in the previous month. Food
prices, particularly fruits, vegetables and pulses, led the decline.
4.
International reserves have declined by US$ 1.1 billion thus far in 2017, standing at US$ 359
billion as of January 6, 2017. International reserves represent about 8 months of next year’s imports of
goods and services. Net portfolio investment outflows (both equity and debt) amounted to about US$ 900
million so far in January 2017. Foreign direct investment inflows have been steady, amounting to US$ 27
billion during the first eight months of FY2016/17. Official intervention data indicates that the RBI’s net
spot sale of foreign currency amounted to US$ 3 billion in October and November 2016, with outstanding
net forward and futures purchases of foreign currency standing at US$ 1.9 billion at end-November. The
Indian rupee remains near its end-December 2016 levels, at about 68 rupees to the U.S. dollar. Although
export growth recovered to 5.7 percent in December from 2.3 percent in November, a decline in import
growth to 0.6 percent from 10.4 percent points to subdued domestic demand.
5.
The GST Council, in its ninth meeting on January 16, 2017, reached a consensus regarding
the sharing of administrative powers between the central government and state governments in
assessing tax payers under the GST. However, detailed rate schedules and draft legislation still have to
be finalized and approved by the Parliament and state Assemblies before the GST can be implemented,
most likely by July 1, 2017.

Statement by Subir Gokarn, Executive Director for India
and Himanshu Joshi, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
January 25, 2017
1.
On behalf of our authorities, we would like to thank staff for presenting a comprehensive
and generally balanced assessment of recent macroeconomic and financial sector developments in
India. The mission team has had broad-based and open discussions with our authorities, which
have been appreciated. We would also like to acknowledge the wide range of analytical exercises
undertaken in the Selected Issues chapters. All of them, from corporate indebtedness to gender
issues, export performance to Universal Basic Income, are high on the authorities’ list of policy
priorities and the staff contributions to the discussions are very valuable.
GDP growth and Outlook
2.
During the first half of 2016-17 the economy recorded GDP growth of 7.2 per cent,
slightly below the 7.5 per cent of the preceding year. Despite slight deceleration in economic
activity, major sectors such as manufacturing and agriculture sustained steady performance.
Consumption demand remains the mainstay, with investment activity continuing to be sluggish.
3.
Against this backdrop, staff recently revised its growth estimate for 2016-17 sharply down
from 7.6 per cent in October to 6.6 per cent in the Staff Report. The primary reason for this is the
temporary disruption in consumption spending caused by the currency policy initiative announced
on November 8, 2016. While we do not question the methodologies used to revise the estimates,
the fact is that there isn’t very much hard data on which to base the revisions. Different
assumptions about the impact will obviously lead to different conclusions. While virtually all
forecasters have revised their projections for 2016-17 downwards, the range is relatively wide.
The World Bank and the Asian Development Bank have pegged growth at 7 per cent after
accounting for the change in currency policy. The authorities’ estimate is 7.1 per cent. In short,
the authorities view the staff projection as unduly pessimistic in terms of both the magnitude of
the shock and its persistence. We will say more about the policy initiative itself later in this
statement. However, we do note that the longer term outlook indicates a return to the earlier
growth trajectory.
Inflation and Monetary Policy
4.
Headline retail inflation has been moderating since August 2016 on easing food prices,
with a notable deceleration in October to 4.2 per cent and further to 3.6 per cent and 3.4 per cent
respectively in November and December, on the back of lower food prices. However, despite the
receding pace of consumer inflation, food prices have generally tended to be volatile. Our
authorities are cognizant of the risk of resurgence of food inflation if the usual pattern of winter
moderation in prices does not materialize going forward. The headline inflation is projected at 5
per cent in March 2017. The Monetary Policy Committee of the Reserve Bank of India kept the
policy rate unchanged at 6.25 per cent in its December policy meeting. Reassuringly, the trends
visible from the November 2016 round of households’ inflation expectations survey indicate that
inflation expectations have declined for three months as well as one year ahead period. Overall,
our authorities concur with staff assessment of the appropriateness of the current policy stance
and the need to maintain vigilance against food price and other shocks.
Fiscal policy

2
5.
We want to emphasize the commitment of our authorities on medium-term fiscal
consolidation. A conducive environment for improvement in state public finances has been
created through suitable incentives/costs for states to renew fiscal efforts towards consolidation.
The passage of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Bill 2016 marks a new era in co-operative
fiscal federalism. The GST system is most likely to be implemented at the earliest in July this
year, as the GST council has finally reached consensus on rate slabs and jurisdictional issues. The
GST will widen and stabilize the indirect tax base by reducing overall tax burden, eliminate
cascading caused by a multitude of existing levies, remove duty exemptions and encourage tax
compliance – all the while reducing tax administration costs and improving the public finances.
As regards debt, India’s public debt is sustainable both because of the authorities’ commitments
for fiscal consolidation and the projected interest versus growth trajectory going forward.
Financial Sector
6.
Progress has been made in the implementation of the Indradhanush initiative announced
by the government in 2015 for improving the functioning public sector banks by strengthening
Board and management appointments, decentralizing more decisions to the professional board
and finding ways to incentivize management to improve loan evaluation, monitoring and
repayment.
7.
To curtail deterioration in asset quality, schemes for identification, restructuring and
resolution of stressed and NPLs have been put in place for revitalizing distressed assets, optimal
structuring of credit facilities, change the ownership/management for reviving bad credits, deep
restructuring of stressed assets and facilitating speedy exit from unviable accounts. The Reserve
Bank initiated an asset quality review (AQR) in December 2015 following which banks were
directed to ensure proper recognition of asset quality and create adequate provisions for all
restructured loans. The tighter scrutiny led to an increase in the stressed assets ratio to 12.3 per
cent by September 2016 from 11.5 per cent in March 2016. At this point, risks to the banking
sector remain elevated owing to the deterioration in asset quality- and significantly so with
respect to large borrowers, low profitability and liquidity. Stress tests reveal that adverse
macroeconomic shocks would lead to increase in GNPA ratios of the scheduled commercial
banks with larger adverse impact on public sector banks. However, despite this, capital adequacy
at the system level and bank group levels is above the regulatory minimum, and has improved
since March 2015.
8.
To enable smooth resolution of large stressed accounts, a coordinated policy for
sustainable restructuring was put in place by means of Scheme for Sustainable Structuring of
Stressed assets (S4A) in November 2016. This involved financial restructuring of such accounts
by way of carving out sustainable and unsustainable parts of debt - with conversion of the latter
into equity. Flexible restructuring of new project loans was also permitted in all sectors including
for the existing long term project loans. These measures were aimed at cleaning-up problem loans
in banks and revitalizing credit delivery. The enactment of the Bankruptcy Code 2016 will enable
recovery through judicial process in reasonable time. To enhance the resilience of banks,
regulatory and supervisory policy responses have been initiated. These include guidelines on large
exposures to contain concentration risks, Net Stable Funding Ratios and rationalization of
ownership limits in private sector banks.
9.
Our authorities have also taken a series of macro-prudential and regulatory measures to
enhance transparency and accountability in financial markets namely, tightening of insider trading

3
norms and improving policies and procedures of credit rating agencies in respect of securities
market and monitoring of foreign direct investment and transfer of shares in the insurance sector.
Measures related to empower customers with wider product choices and mechanisms for
grievance redressal have also been implemented.
10.
A distinct issue, but one which is directly related to the asset quality problem is corporate
indebtedness. High leverage and consequent interest burdens hamper the viability of companies
and this factor could be playing a role in aggregate investment behavior. This issue is analyzed in
a Selective Issues chapter and select results are presented in the Staff Report. Staff’s assessment is
mixed; it acknowledges that the situation is improving, but at a relatively slow pace. Even with
the improvement, debt indicators remain uncomfortably high. However, our authorities would
like to point out that this conclusion is highly sensitive to sample selection. Analysis carried out
by the Reserve Bank of India using a different sample of companies indicates significantly more
improvement in the indicators. The problem may not be as acute as the Staff Report assesses it to
be.
External Sector
11.
India has been able to contain its CAD in past two years to 1.3 per cent and 1.1 per cent of
GDP in 2014-15 and 2015-16 respectively. Importantly, although exports have returned to
positive growth after a long decline, our authorities observe that India faces high non-tariff
barriers for exports, even as the MFN applied tariff rates on non-agricultural exports are held at
reasonably low level in relation to peer countries. Notwithstanding this, the CAD is expected to
be contained around at one per cent for this year as a whole. As regards the capital account, FDI
inflows have been robust. During April-November 2016 net FDI inflows were US $ 25.7 billion,
higher than US $ 23.7 billion in the same period last year. Foreign exchange reserves stood at US
$ 359 billion in January 2017, covering around eight months of imports.
Structural Reforms
12.
The Staff Report provides a comprehensive listing of reforms either implemented or in the
process of being so by the authorities. They represent a broad-based effort to accelerate growth,
increase productivity, reduce inequality, improve welfare and enhance transparency and
compliance. In the interests of brevity, we will focus on only two – the currency policy initiative,
already mentioned earlier in a different context, and the gender initiative.
The Currency Policy Initiative
13.
Much coverage has been provided and opinions expressed on the dramatic decision by the
authorities to withdraw high-denomination currency notes from circulation on November 8, 2016.
The authorities would like to place this decision in the larger context of a series of structural
reforms aimed at enhancing transparency of activity and tax compliance. The GST
implementation is one of the pillars of this, but several other measures have also been initiated – a
voluntary disclosure of income scheme, tracking of high-value transactions through taxpayer ID
numbers and so on. Others, such as reforming the real estate registration process to ensure
transparency, are being discussed.
14.
The currency policy initiative was motivated by three considerations. One, the prevalence
of cash transactions was contributing to widespread tax evasion and the building up of cash
hoards. Two, the continuing validity of old and less secure currency notes, even as newer and
more secure ones were introduced, increased the threat from counterfeit notes. Three, over the

4
past few years, there has been a significant increase in the capacity and efficiency of the payments
infrastructure, contributing to the emergence of a range of cash-alternative modes of payment.
15.
The initiative has unquestionably caused disruptions. However, even while there is some
debate on how long these would persist, there is no doubt that they are transitory. A noteworthy
outcome of the policy initiative is that the payments and settlement system has been able to
accommodate massive increases in the use of cash-alternatives without any sign of fragility. The
very large shift of even low-value transactions to these alternatives represents a significant
success of the initiative.
16.
A more general point needs to be made in the context of structural reform. The steadfast
advice from the Fund to member countries is to carry out structural reforms when macroeconomic
conditions are hospitable, which can help in minimizing the disruptions and speeding up the
return to normal. The current macroeconomic situation in India – relatively rapid growth,
relatively low inflation, fiscal consolidation on track and a relatively low CAD – provides the
right environment in which to launch initiatives of this kind; the impact and persistence of any
disruptions are likely to be minimized in these conditions.
The Gender Initiative
17.
Our authorities welcome the Fund’s piloting of analysis of gender issues as part of the
Article IV process in India. We expect this analysis to increasingly contribute to the policy debate
and the identification of effective policy measures for gender equity. The Staff Report and the
Selected Issues Paper have both described a number of initiatives in this regard. We would like to
highlight the fact that the policy takes a life-cycle approach to the issue. It recognizes that the
right interventions at every stage of life will determine the success of the policy.
18.
The approach therefore complements interventions at the childhood stage (Celebrate Girl
Child, Educate Girl Child) with initiatives relating to skilling, livelihood and financial access. In
this regard, a new National Policy on Women is being formulated to promote gender equality and
to support women’s aspirations. A national fund has been established to provide micro-credit at
affordable cost to poor women to support income generation activities. An electronic platform has
also been provided for self-employed women to enable them to get the right value for their
products/services by linking them to the markets directly. Steps are also being taken to facilitate
and expand employment opportunities for female workers.
