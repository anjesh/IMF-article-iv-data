IMF Executive Board Concludes 2015 Article IV Consultation and First Post-Program
Monitoring Discussions with St. Kitts and Nevis
On August 31, 2015, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation1 and the First Post-Program 2 with St. Kitts and Nevis.
The economic situation has continued to improve since the completion of the Fund-supported
home-grown economic program in July 2014. Continued rapid inflows under the Citizenship-By
Investment (CBI) program have led to a surge in construction activity, and supported a large
increase in government and Sugar Industry Diversification Fund (SIDF) investments and
spending, including on the People Employment Program (PEP). These factors, together with the
ongoing recovery in tourist arrivals fueled rapid GDP growth of about 6 percent in 2013 and
2014. The banking system has remained stable, notwithstanding the restructuring of government
debt held by the banks. However, the growth of private sector credit, while turning positive, has
remained very weak, despite the high bank liquidity. Inflation has remained very low, at 0.6
percent at end-2014, reflecting weak international commodity prices. The current account deficit
remained at about 7.5 percent of GDP, below historical levels, on the back of high CBI
budgetary inflows, while external reserves remain high at about 9 months of imports.
The fiscal balance has remained high. Tax revenues grew more rapidly than GDP, offsetting
higher expenditures, including the thirteenth month wage bonus and reforms to the CBI program.
CBI budgetary revenues surpassed their 2013 performance, reaching 14 percent of GDP. The

Under Article IV of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, staff prepares a report, which forms
the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country’s authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summing up can be found here:

Post-Program Monitoring provides for more frequent consultations between the Fund and members whose
arrangements has expired but that continue to have Fund credit outstanding, with a particular focus on policies that
have a bearing on external viability. There is a presumption that members whose credit outstanding exceeds 200
percent of quota would engage in Post-Program Monitoring.

overall fiscal surplus in 2014 was 9.5 percent, compared to 12 percent in 2013, primarily on
account of substantial decline in SIDF support to the budget. Debt has declined faster than
planned, reflecting higher GDP growth and advance debt repayments, to reach 79 percent of
GDP at end-2014 compared to 100.8 percent at end-2013.
The near-term outlook remains strong, but there are risks on the horizon. The imposition of visa
requirements by Canada, combined with new competition on the CBI front, from neighboring
countries and globally, raising uncertainty regarding future CBI inflows. Further, while the high
fiscal surplus allows the government to accommodate the expected decline in tax revenues from
the substantial widening in VAT and custom exemptions granted in December 2014 and April
2015, these measures may undermine fiscal and debt sustainability over the medium term.
Without corrective measures, the new exemptions could lead to a reversal of the downward
trajectory of the debt-to-GDP ratio, particularly in case of a natural disaster or an exogenous
shock. Finally, a substantial part of the rapid reduction in the debt-to-GDP ratio is the result of
the debt-land swap. A reversal of this operation would erode much of the gains in debt
sustainability and increase fiscal spending on debt service.
Over the medium term, growth is expected to converge to the regional average of about 2.5
percent, consistent with the staff’s cautious assumptions regarding CBI inflows, as large CBI
construction projects reach completion, and tourism resumes as the main driver of growth.
Executive Board Assessment3
Executive Directors welcomed the strong economic performance of St. Kitts and Nevis since the
completion of the three-year Stand-By Arrangement, as evidenced by rapid growth and the
strong fiscal position. Although the outlook remains favorable, it is vulnerable to a possible
reduction of the large inflows of recent years under the Citizenship-By-Investment (CBI)
Program. Directors therefore stressed the need for continued prudent policies and structural
reforms to safeguard fiscal and debt sustainability and deliver broad-based growth.
Directors welcomed the improvement in tax revenue collection and the large fiscal surplus
achieved in 2014. Most Directors, however, were concerned that the recent introduction of VAT
and custom duties exemptions could erode past gains and increase vulnerability to volatile CBI
inflows, unless accompanied by offsetting measures. In this regard, Directors encouraged the
authorities to strengthen fiscal buffers with continued reform of tax administration and public
financial management, civil service reform, measures to limit tax incentives, and improved
monitoring of public enterprises.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers
used in summing up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

Directors commended the authorities’ efforts to pre-pay debt. Despite the considerable progress,
public debt remains high, and Directors recommended continued early repayment of debt with
CBI savings. Noting the substantial gains from debt restructuring and the debt-land swap,
Directors encouraged the authorities to preserve this progress.
Directors welcomed the ongoing reform of the CBI program to strengthen due diligence and the
efforts to coordinate policies on these programs in the region. They encouraged the authorities to
establish an effective and transparent framework for saving and managing the budgetary
resources from the program. They also stressed the importance of improving the management
and transparency of the Sugar Investment Diversification Foundation. These steps will reduce
pro-cyclical stimulus, contain risks to the economy from a possible reduction of these inflows,
and gradually eliminate quasi-fiscal expenditures.
Directors noted that the financial system is stable, and called for continuous efforts to strengthen
financial supervision, reduce nonperforming loans, and foster sound credit growth. They
welcomed the passage of the banking legislation, which will facilitate the implementation of the
regional banking resolution strategy. They encouraged the authorities to continue monitoring
developments and coordinate with the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union (ECCB) as needed.
Directors considered that any extension of offshore banking should be accompanied by adequate
supervision and compliance with global Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of
Terrorism (AML/CFT) regulation and tax reporting requirements. Moving forward with a plan
for the land held by the Special Land Sales Company would bolster banks’ balance sheets.
Directors agreed that faster progress on structural reform is key to enhancing competitiveness
and medium-term growth prospects. Priorities include strengthening support to the tourism
sector, improving the business climate, and diversifying into alternative energy sources.
Directors underscored the importance of upgrading the quality of macroeconomic data.

2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION AND FIRST POSTPROGRAM MONITORING DISCUSSIONS

KEY ISSUES
Context and post-program performance: Macroeconomic conditions continued to
improve, with the economy recording a second year of strong growth of about 6 percent,
significantly higher than envisaged in the 9th Review. The fiscal balance has also been
exceptionally strong, reflecting both robust tax revenues and continued strong growth of
CBI budgetary fees, while the debt-to-GDP ratio has fallen more rapidly than projected,
to 79 percent of GDP. A new government won elections and assumed power in February
2015, which delayed the PPM mission.
Article IV: The last Article IV consultation was concluded on March 19, 2014. Current
discussions focused on sustaining fiscal prudence, making progress with debt-land
swaps, and boosting reform momentum following a further widening of tax
exemptions and heightened uncertainty about future CBI inflows. The mission also
urged the development of a plan for managing the CBI inflows, support for the
regional bank strategy while continuing to strengthen bank oversight, preserving debt
sustainability with a strategy for moving forward with the debt-land swap,
implementing growth enhancing reforms focusing on strengthening tourism,
developing cost-effective energy solutions, and improving the business environment.
Post-Program Monitoring: The 36-month SBA for SDR 52.51 million (590 percent of
quota) was concluded on July 27, 2014, with total withdrawals of SDR 47.37 million.
Following several advance repayments, Fund credit outstanding fell to 298 percent of
quota as of end-June 2015, placing St. Kitts and Nevis under Post-Program Monitoring
till May 2016, absent additional early repayments.
Authorities’ views: The authorities broadly agreed with the staff’s assessment of the key
economic challenges and policy recommendations and they explained that they need
time to develop a strategy to address these, consistent with their objective of sharing
more widely the benefits of the improved macroeconomic conditions. They are
considering options to increase revenues by reducing tax exemptions while improving
conditions for domestic investment. They have launched a comprehensive reform of the
CBI program to improve its sustainability. They are also contemplating changes to the
debt-land swap in a manner that would best serve the national interest while preserving
gains in debt sustainability.

CONTEXT
1.
The economic situation has continued to improve with robust growth and a strong
fiscal balance. Economic growth for 2013-2014 averaged about 6 percent per year, the fiscal
surplus remained high as a result of strong tax revenue, which more than offset higher spending,
while the public debt-to-GDP ratio fell faster than anticipated. This follows the successful completion
of the 36-month exceptional access SBA, which aimed to restore growth and fiscal and debt
sustainability, while preserving financial stability.1 Under the program, St. Kitts and Nevis
implemented substantial fiscal consolidation measures, undertook a major debt restructuring
exercise, including a debt-land swap, while making substantial progress with key structural reforms.
The latter included strengthening tax administration and improving public financial management.
There was considerable progress in implementing Fund policy advice from the 2014 Article IV
consultation but important issues remain outstanding (Box 1).
2.
Recent developments suggest increased risks to the Citizenship-By-Investment (CBI)
program, the main driver of the economy’s strong performance. The Canadian imposition of
visa requirements on citizens of St. Kitts and Nevis on November 22, 2014 led the government to
undertake important reforms to address security concerns. However, the heightened international
scrutiny, combined with substantial competition from new CBI programs in the region and globally,
raises concerns about the sustainability of these inflows.
3.
Recent elections led to a change in administration. Team Unity, a three-party coalition
won Parliamentary elections on February 16th, 2015, with Dr. Timothy Harris replacing
Dr. Denzil Douglas—the country’s Prime Minister since 1995. The campaign promised strong
employment creation, lower taxes, and higher welfare benefits, and opposed the debt-land swaps.
The campaign also promised to strengthen the CBI program administration and improve the
transparency of the operations of the Sugar Investment Diversification Foundation (SIDF). The new
government has already moved by widening tax exemptions introduced by the previous
government and stepped up the reform of the CBI program.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
4.
The buoyant recovery reflects a surge in construction activity. Growth in 2013 was
revised up from 3.8 percent to 6.2 percent and, estimated to have been 6.1 percent in 2014, driven
by the surge in CBI-related construction activity, government and Sugar Industry Diversification
Foundation (SIDF) investments and spending, including the People Employment Program (PEP), and
the ongoing recovery in tourist arrivals.2 Wages and employment in the construction sector were

up by 30 and 15 percent, respectively. Inflation
remained low at 0.6 percent (y/y) at end-2014,
reflecting low commodity prices. The current
account deficit has remained lower than its
historical average, at around 7.5 percent of GDP,
owing to high CBI service receipts. International
reserves continued to increase in 2014, with
import coverage remaining at about 9 months.

than offsetting higher spending. Reflecting the
strength of the economic activity, tax revenue increased by 1 percentage point from 2013,
significantly higher than envisaged in the 9th Review in Eastern Caribbean dollar (EC$) terms.
Current spending was also higher than projected (in EC$) in the 9th Review as a result of the 13thmonth salary bonus, increased outlays, in part related to CBI program reforms and higher transfers,
but continued to decline as a percent of GDP. Meanwhile, CBI budgetary revenues grew to
14.1 percent of GDP from 13 percent in 2013. As a result, the surplus before grants increased to
6.5 percent of GDP, from 5.2 percent in 2013. Significantly lower grants in 2014, including from the
SIDF, generated a decline in the headline central government surplus to 9.5 percent of GDP from
12.1 percent in 2013. Netting the impact of grants, CBI flows and SIDF budgetary support, the
central government registered an improvement of 1.5 percent of GDP in 2014.3,4 Debt declined
faster than anticipated, reflecting higher GDP growth and advance debt repayments, to 79 percent
of GDP at end-2014 compared to a projected 86.2 percent, and 100.8 percent at end-2013. In

The fiscal performance of Nevis was weaker, reflecting slower revenue growth, and higher current and capital

Box 1. Implementation of 2014 Article IV Recommendations1
The authorities undertook the following actions, consistent with the last Article IV recommendations:
 Completed the second tranche of the debt-land swap agreement for St. Kitts and the first tranche
for Nevis.
 Saved a large portion of CBI budgetary revenues to build further precautionary buffers.
 Reduced public debt more rapidly using accumulated government deposits.
 Limited discretionary tax exemptions on new construction projects to about EC$100 million limits.
 Passed a new Customs Law in November 2014 to facilitate the enforcement of post-clearance audits
at the Customs and Excise Department.
 Further strengthened the tax administration, including greater focus on large tax-payers,
representing 80 percent of total tax revenues and broadening the tax base by limiting deductions.
 Progressed with civil service reform by operationalizing the implementing regulations of the 2011
Civil Service Act, in May 2014, for the effective implementation of the legislation, and began the
payroll audit and functional review of selected departments, with the final review due for completion
by end-2015.
 Made important revisions to strengthen the National Energy Policy and Action Plan and made
significant progress in negotiations on the geothermal project in Nevis.
Policy action was slow, delayed, or reversed, in the following areas:
 Introducing new VAT and import duties exemptions that staff estimates will lead to substantial loss
of tax revenues absent offsetting measures.
 Mobilizing land sales by the Special Land Sales Company (St. Kitts).
 Curtailing tax holidays and centralizing the power to grant and manage tax incentives in the Ministry
of Finance and moving from discretionary to a rules-based concessions system.
 Strengthening oversight of public enterprises and enhancing their reporting requirements.
 Implementing an action plan to improve the business climate, which was, however, initiated in 2015.
 Publishing the latest audited financial statements of SIDF.
 Developing a time-table for implementing parametric reforms proposed in the latest actuarial
review of the Social Security Board (SSB).
 Strengthening statistical capacity.

The banking system remains stable while
credit growth is low. The debt-land swap in July
2013 and August 2014 contributed to increasing
indigenous banks’ NPL ratio to 16.8 percent as of
2014Q4, as public sector loans were removed from
the balance of total loans.5 Private sector credit
recovered modestly by 0.5 percent (y/y) in December
2014, following two years of contraction, reflecting
banks’ low risk appetite and the elevated NPL ratio.
On other hand, bank liquidity continued to grow,
fuelled by strong deposit growth associated with high
CBI inflows and government savings.

Sources: Authorities and IMF staff estimates.

OUTLOOK: STRONG BUT WITH NEW RISKS
7.
Near-term economic growth is set to
continue, albeit at a somewhat slower pace.
Growth is expected to slow to about 5 percent in
2015 and 3.5 percent in 2016, reflecting some
moderation of construction activity; the output gap
is estimated to close in 2015. The authorities are
more bullish on growth, projecting a 7 percent
increase in 2015, reflecting strong first quarter
developments. Given considerable uncertainty
related to the CBI program following the Canadian
action and growing competition, staff is more
cautious and assumes a substantial slowdown in the
pace of inflows. Inflation is forecast to be negative
2.2 percent in 2015 as a result of the VAT
exemptions on food items, which represent
25 percent of the consumer basket, and the decline
in global commodity prices.

construction, and moderate growth prospects for key tourism source markets. This implies an
average growth of 3.9 percent for 2013-2020, roughly the same as the pre-crisis average of
4 percent over 1991-2008, a period buffeted by negative exogenous shocks, including natural
disasters. Risks to the outlook, highlighted in the Risk Assessment Matrix (Annex I), are broadly
balanced. These include the potential fallout of the regional financial resolution process,
vulnerability to natural disasters, and slower growth in advanced economies. On the upside, CBI and
FDI inflows could be more buoyant than anticipated in the baseline.
9.
The external sustainability analysis suggests that the current account deficit is larger
than implied by fundamentals, while the exchange rate is somewhat overvalued.6 The current
account deficit is expected to deteriorate by about 5 percentage points to 12.6 percent in 2015
reflecting the staff’s cautious projection for CBI inflows for the rest of the year. Excluding CBI
receipts, the current account balance remains broadly stable as higher good imports are offset by
lower energy cost. Reserves are projected to fall reflecting planned debt repayment, but remain
adequate, covering 8 months of imports in 2015.7 Competitiveness indicators – including the
investment climate and tourism performance – suggest ongoing challenges (Annex II). The capacity
to repay has substantially improved reflecting higher growth and advance repayments to the Fund,
with outstanding Fund credit projected at end-2015 to be about 14 percent of imputed reserves
compared to projection of 21 percent at the last review.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
Discussions during the Article IV consultation focused on (i) securing fiscal sustainability following a
widening of tax exemptions and greater uncertainty regarding future CBI inflows; (ii) strengthening the
management of the CBI program and associated inflows; (iii) preserving financial stability following
the debt-land swap and high liquidity; and (iv) implementing policies aimed at enhancing growth.
These were also critical issues for the PPM review.

A. Safeguarding Fiscal Sustainability
10.
The new VAT exemptions, combined with a weakening of the outlook for CBI inflows,
increase fiscal vulnerabilities and raise new challenges to sustainability. The VAT and customs
exemptions are estimated to lead to a direct loss of revenues of over 2 percent of GDP in 2015,
relative to what they would have been, and a larger amount in 2016, when the full year impact will
be realized.8 The projected weakening

last review. Moreover, any slowdown in CBI inflows could further erode the tax base resulting in a
higher shortfall than that implied from the direct loss in CBI revenues. The weaker fiscal outlook,
combined with scheduled debt repayment, could substantially reduce accumulated fiscal buffers,
and could trigger a renewed upturn in the debt-to-GDP ratio in case of an exogenous shock.

Staff strongly recommended corrective action to safeguard fiscal and debt
sustainability. The need for this is underscored by the country’s high vulnerability to external
shocks (including natural disasters), the still high debt-to-GDP ratio, and heightened uncertainty
regarding the sustainability of CBI inflows. Reversing the VAT exemptions and using the social safety
net to more effectively target assistance to the poorer segments of the population is the optimal
strategy. This would also reduce the pro-cyclicality of fiscal policy. Staff also presented alternative
measures given the political difficulty of reversing recently granted VAT exemptions in the short run.
These would bring back the fiscal path over the next 3 years to that envisaged in the 9th review.
These measures include further reducing tax exemptions for construction projects, since the sector
needs no further incentives given the

secure fiscal and debt sustainability over the medium term and place the authorities in a stronger
position to deal with exogenous shocks.
12.
The rest of the public sector must also play its part in maintaining a sound financial
position. Continued monitoring and strict oversight of public sector activity must be a priority. In
particular, the absence of financial statements for the electricity company, SKELEC, since its
incorporation makes concrete assessments of its financial position difficult. Although SKELEC has
improved its billing and metering, the company continues to face challenges, including in collecting
overdue bills. Additionally, the recent government action to write off residential customer arrears of
EC$21 million will need to be offset by some other asset or a reduction in liabilities. Staff stressed
the need to devise a strategy to ensure the medium-term viability of SKELEC. Staff also noted that
reforms to the Social Security Board will be needed, as outlays are expected to overtake total
income by 2024, based on the 2013 actuarial review (Box 2).


10

Authorities’ views: The authorities broadly agreed that additional measures will be needed
to preserve fiscal sustainability, but they stressed the importance of more widely sharing the
benefits of the improved public finances. Exempting food and other basic necessities was a
quick and direct way to deliver these benefits. They are looking to raise additional revenue
by broadening the tax base, especially by reducing discretionary tax incentives and seek to
optimize the benefits already provided to ensure that new construction projects contribute
more to the economy (Box 3). They also plan to complete the ongoing work to revise the
investment code to increase transparency and reduce discretion. They will look to update

the valuation of properties to ensure that property tax collection is in line with recent market
developments. They agreed with the need to continue public sector reforms, including
strengthening the oversight of public enterprises, although they noted that reforming
SKELEC will take time.
13.
Substantial progress has been made in reducing public debt, although the debt-toGDP ratio remains high and continues to be vulnerable to adverse shocks. Public debt declined
to 79 percent of GDP at end-2014, and is half of that in 2010, reflecting further debt-land swaps,
advance repayments, and economic growth. However, at nearly 80 percent of GDP, the debt remains
high, and risks to debt sustainability over the medium term are elevated given plausible shocks
(Annex III). Staff welcomed plans to further accelerate repayments, which are estimated to reduce
debt to 66.3 percent of GDP at end-2015 compared to 73 percent if debt is paid as scheduled. The
gross debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to fall to 52.1 percent by 2020, but in the absence of
strengthening fiscal policy, accumulated government deposits will be depleted. Staff also
recommended lengthening the tenor of debt instruments, which are mostly in the form of 91-day
T-bills, while continuing to reduce borrowing costs as the government is now in a strong position to
obtain better terms.


Authorities’ views: The authorities pointed to the substantial progress and further plans for
advance debt repayment, including to the IMF. They have also agreed on a new repayment
schedule with one non-Paris Club creditor, will repay another, and plan to finalize debt
restructuring negotiations with other non-Paris Club creditors. They continue to work towards
reducing borrowing cost on remaining outstanding obligations, and have had some success,
including reducing the interest on new T-bills to rates ranging from 4.75 percent to 5.0 percent.
However, lengthening the tenor of T-bills may be more challenging given the limited market
appetite for longer maturities. NIA noted that they were facing challenges in raising funding.

B. Managing CBI Inflows and Improving the Accountability of the Sugar
Industry Diversification Foundation
14.
The reform of the CBI program to improve its operations and strengthen the
due diligence framework will improve the program’s sustainability. The reforms being
implemented include using a minimum of three due diligence companies to leverage their different
strengths, incorporating a risk matrix to the reports, increasing CBI Unit staffing and upgrading IT to
improve efficiency and reporting capacity. Steps taken to improve transparency of the operations
and increasing collaboration with other programs in the region are also important for ensuring high
standards for due diligence. Staff urged the government to quickly complete the reforms to the CBI
Unit, while continuing to strengthen its oversight. Reforms will also be needed to enhance
supervision and monitoring of real estate developments and ensure that the pipeline of CBI-related
condominium developments be consistent with the tourism master plan.

Box 2. The Social Security Board
The Social Security Board (SSB) is in a stable
financial position with substantial investment funds.
The SSB is currently in surplus, averaging 3.8 percent of
GDP per year over 2009-2013, with a reserveexpenditure ratio of 20 years.1 Reserves have been
increasing steadily reaching around 65 percent of GDP
in 2013, the highest in the ECCU. The scheme is also the
most liquid, with more than 60 percent of its assets in
bank deposits, comprising 17 percent of total banking
system deposits. Investments in the public sector,
including in public sector enterprises, represented
around 20 percent of the investment portfolio as of
end-2014, while real estate investments comprised at
least 7 percent.

The ageing population dynamics are expected to negatively impact the long–run sustainability of the
SSB. Based on the 9th actuarial review, the dependency ratio of pensioners to working age persons is
expected to more than double from 0.15 to 0.33 by 2035, and to triple to 0.44 by 2055. The 10th review
indicates that the SSB will start running down resources between 2024-2030, and exhaust reserves between
2038 and 2044.2 Nonetheless, strong employment growth in the past two years has led to a significant
increase in contributions, with benefit expenditure currently standing at 72 percent of contribution income.
Reform of the pension scheme should be a
policy priority. The 9th actuarial review
recommended reforms including: increasing
the minimum retirement age for full pension
entitlement from 62 to 65; raising contribution
rates; increasing the period over which
insurable earnings are averaged to calculate
benefits; and indexing annual adjustments of
pension payments to actual inflation. The
investment portfolio of the SSB also needs to
be diversified since the current asset mix is
significantly exposed to the government and
statutory bodies, including state-owned
indigenous banks.

and the Duty Free Shop Act. However, Cabinet has the authority to grant concessions, and in practice, has
discretion in almost all aspects of the decision, including the terms of the concessions. This results in many
concessions being provided on a case-by-case basis, based on special Cabinet decisions.
The tourism sector share of foregone revenue has declined. 2As with other ECCU countries, the main
argument for granting concessions is to encourage investment in tourism. However, it appears that other

received by projects that are accorded incentives. Staff also suggested centralizing the power to grant and
manage tax incentives at the Ministry of Finance as a move towards a more rules-based concessions system.

The cap and estimates exclude corporate income tax since the authorities do not have a reliable methodology to estimate
forgone revenue from these sources. The FAD report “Tax Incentives and Property Taxation in the ECCU”, by Norregaard, J., E.
Crivelli, R. Franzsen, and R. Krelove, IMF (2015), estimate these at 1 percent of GDP.

These estimates are about half of the estimates of tourism-related exemptions in the abovementioned study, so this may also
reflect classification issues.

15.
In light of the uncertainty surrounding future CBI inflows, careful management of the
stock of accumulated savings should be a priority. Staff urged the authorities to create a
comprehensive and transparent CBI management framework, build precautionary balances to
address exogenous shocks, stabilize economic activity, and prepay debt. Indeed, the return on
government deposits is likely to fall short of the cost of debt. CBI resources could also be used for
investment in high-priority public projects, subject to a rigorous cost-benefit analysis. While such a
framework may take some time to establish, the government should proceed with interim plans to
invest these savings abroad, to reduce the pressure on banks’ profitability (see below).9
14.
Strengthening of SIDF management and its integration with the government accounts
should be a high priority. The SIDF has been increasingly involved in quasi-fiscal activities,
including substantial expenditure under PEP (see below). A clear operational framework limiting
these operations is needed. Transfers from the SIDF to the budget should also be limited, and be
subject to clear rules, to ensure that the government operates with a clearly defined budget
constraint. The selection of SIDF investment projects needs to be transparent and based on sound
economic returns, while SIDF financial statements should be audited and released to the public on a
timely basis.10 Over the medium term, staff recommends establishing an overarching framework to
integrate saving and investment activities of the SIDF with the government under a SWF structure,
with strong accountability and governance frameworks to preserve accumulated savings and allow
for the sustainable use of the resources to face exogenous shocks and promote long-term
development (Annex IV).
15.
The operation and costs of PEP need to be streamlined. Around 3,300 persons were
employed under the program as of end-March 2015, with a cost of about 3 percent of GDP for 2014.
Although PEP supported employment when the economy was operating with considerable excess
capacity, it needs to be downsized and refocused on skills development in line with labor market
needs. Restructuring the program should include establishing a strict budget for its operations,
limiting enrollment periods, and lowering the stipend below the minimum wage. Incentives should
be put in place to ensure both applicants and participating employers treat it as a training
opportunity rather than a permanent subsidy. Plans will need to be made to redeploy the majority
of participants working at the public sector since these cannot be absorbed by the civil service, if
fiscal discipline is to be sustained.
Authorities’ views: Substantial progress has already been made in reforming CBI operations
and strengthening security. Government’s effort to coordinate with other programs in the region
will help maintain high standards. Notwithstanding, the implementation of reforms must not be
rushed, but given adequate time to implement the necessary changes to ensure a stronger and
more credible program. The authorities plan to strengthen outreach to clarify the reforms and
reduce adverse impressions that the program has stalled. They agreed that construction projects

under the CBI program need greater scrutiny and are looking at options to maintain the value of
real estate projects. They plan to reform the SIDF and are beginning to examine alternatives, and
are eager to improve the transparency and accountability of its operations. They are keenly
aware of the need to limit and reform PEP to move it to a sustainable path, but they will need to
move gradually in light of the large number of participants.

The regional banking resolution is progressing. The authorities should continue to
consult with the ECCB on addressing regional financial sector issues following the completion of the
asset quality reviews. We commend the authorities for ratifying the new banking law which will
facilitate the implementation of the regional financial resolution plans.11 The government should
continue to exercise caution and due diligence in assessing plans for regional financial integration to
safeguard St. Kitts and Nevis’ banking system and ensure its viability and efficiency going forward.
18.
Moving forward with the land sales will consolidate the progress with debt
restructuring. Unwinding the debt-land swap would jeopardize the hard earned gains in fiscal and

debt sustainability.12 An extension of the dividend agreement—a three year agreement to pay banks
a dividend of 3.5 percent per annum on the stock of land held by the Special Land Sales Company
(SLSC)—would provide time to consider options. The SLSC’s executive board should be reappointed
and authorized to develop long-term strategies that would benefit the country. Moving forward
with land sales will help enhance potential growth through the wider deployment of otherwise idle
land assets. It will promote the development of a stronger middle class, stimulate construction by
domestic developers for local consumption, and contribute to supporting other sectors, including
medical schools, agricultural projects, as well as tourism.
19.
Expansion of the offshore financial sector needs to follow best practices. New
legislation passed in June 2015 in Nevis facilitates the establishment of offshore banks. Staff
cautioned that offshore banks should comply with global AML/CFT regulations and enhanced
reporting requirements for tax compliance (e.g. FATCA), and will require direct oversight and strict
monitoring by the Financial Services Regulatory Commission (FSRC). It would also be important to
consider ramifications on the onshore banking system, and potential loss of correspondent banking
relations of indigenous banks.13 Additionally, any perception of an offshore banking jurisdiction as
being a tax haven can negatively impact the image of the CBI program, leading to increased
pressure by the international community through greater travel restrictions, undermining the
sustainability of the CBI program.


Authorities’ views: They were mindful of risks related to the regional financial resolution and
the high NPL ratio. On the challenges created by the debt-land swap, they noted that preserving
public land is of special significance to the nation. Their first priority is to introduce transparency
to the process, while considering the merits of individual transactions, ensuring that they are
consistent with the government’s overall vision for the country. They will consider options for
addressing the debt-land swap while developing a long-term strategy for land use that would
be consistent with supporting strong economic growth. They assured staff that any new offshore
bank would need to meet criteria established under the country’s Anti-Money Laundering
legislation.

D. Stepping Up Growth-oriented Reforms
20.
Reforms to support sustainable private sector development could reduce growth
volatility and make the economic recovery underway more durable. The priorities are:


Enhance tourism’s contribution to the economy. Steadfast implementation of the new
tourism master strategy will help diversify source markets, raise the value-added of tourism

12

A reversal of the debt-land swap would increase public debt by 33 percent of 2015 GDP and could entail some
additional fiscal penalties for unwinding agreements already in place.
13

US FATCA reporting requirements have prompted international banks to re-evaluate their correspondent banking
relationships in the region, with one bank in the Caribbean already having lost access to international bank
correspondents.

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ST. KITTS AND NEVIS

through upgrading hotel and infrastructure, develop niche markets and increase backward
linkages to other economic sectors. Initiatives to enhance the quality of tourism service
provision, including the center of excellence for human resource training, could provide
much-needed skills to boost high-end tourism services.





Continue efforts to improve the investment climate. The development and
implementation of a strategic plan to improve processes for registering property, securing
credit, enforcing contracts and resolving insolvencies remain critical. Expeditious
implementation of the new Bankruptcy and Insolvency Bill would help foster domestic credit
growth.



Reduce dependence on fossil fuels. High energy cost is an important factor behind the
high cost of doing business. Implementing the national energy initiative and identifying
adjustments to the regulatory and institutional environment of the energy sector is crucial
for the country’s energy independence. To that end, recent sharp declines in fuel prices
heighten the need for cost analysis of energy-related initiatives (Annex V).



Improve statistical capabilities. Significant data gaps exist in the Balance of Payments and
National Accounts and Fiscal statistics, hampering economic assessment and policy
prescription. This reflects methodological challenges in estimating value added in various
sectors, and the absence of data, including, for example, on the impact of the large number
of medical school students on the economy. Harnessing technical assistance and
accelerating institutional reforms, in particular through increased staffing and training, is
critical to identifying and closing data gaps (Informational Annex).

Authorities’ views: The authorities agreed with these priorities and noted that substantive work
has already taken place in this regard. The challenge is implementing these plans in a cost
effective manner given capacity constraints in nearly all areas of government.

STAFF APPRAISAL
21.
Economic performance since the completion of the three-year Fund arrangement has
been impressive. The economy continued to expand at a rapid pace, averaging just above
6 percent in both 2013 and 2014. Public finances remained on a very strong footing,
notwithstanding the run up to the elections in early 2015, while the debt-to GDP ratio has fallen
much faster than anticipated. The strong economic activity reflects primarily a construction boom
fueled by inflows under the CBI program, government and SIDF investment and expenditure,
including on PEP, and a continued recovery in tourist arrivals.
22.
The outlook for 2015-2016 is positive, although the pace of expansion is expected to
somewhat moderate and the economy remains vulnerable to changes in CBI flow. Over the
medium term, staff projects a return to more moderate growth rates, as construction projects
conclude and the tourism sector continues to expand. However, new developments with the CBI

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

ST. KITTS AND NEVIS

program, mainly loss of visa free access to Canada and considerable increase in competition from
new programs in the region and globally, raise new concerns about the sustainability of the CBI
inflows, which have played such a crucial role in turning around the economy.
23.
The strong 2014 fiscal outturn was supported by robust tax revenues. Growth in tax
revenues more than offset higher-than-planned expenditures, including the 13th-month wage
bonus. CBI revenues to the budget increased to about 14 percent of GDP, also higher than in 2013.
The strong fiscal outcome, combined with additional progress with the debt-land swaps and
advance debt repayment, led to a further decline in public debt to 79 percent of GDP at end-2014,
compared to 100.8 percent at end-2013, and 159.3 percent in 2010. St. Kitts and Nevis’ debt-to-GDP
ratio is now below the ECCU average.
24.
Recent policy changes will need to be addressed to safeguard the substantial
achievements in fiscal and debt sustainability. The widening of the VAT and customs exemptions
could lead to a growing fiscal imbalance that could quickly deplete the country’s accumulated
savings, and lead to a reversal in the downward trend of the debt-to-GDP ratio, particularly if the
country experiences an exogenous shock. Corrective measures are needed to prevent the adverse
impact on government finances, including substantially reducing tax exemptions, while continuing
to implement other structural reforms that are already in train, mainly further strengthening tax
administration, implementing the civil service reform, and improving public financial management.
Strengthening the performance of public enterprises, and moving forward with reforms of the social
security system are also important.
25.
The implementation of substantive measures to strengthen the administration and the
security of the CBI program should improve its sustainability. We commended the authorities
for their commitment to and progress with reforming the CBI program and their leadership in
enhancing cooperation with neighboring islands. Increased risk to CBI inflows underscores the
importance of careful use and preservation of the stock of accumulated savings. Staff urges
establishing an effective and transparent framework to manage the CBI inflows and savings in the
banking system, as well as more stringent oversight of development projects. The SIDF operations
should also be reviewed, and its audited accounts should be made available to the public, with a
view to its gradual integration with the budget. Moreover, the strong economic environment
provides an opportunity to streamline PEP’s operations and reinforce the temporary nature of its
program.
26.
Financial stability has been preserved notwithstanding debt restructuring that has
impacted financial soundness indicators. The resulting high NPL ratio may be inhibiting new
lending, and efforts to bring it down rapidly together with continued vigilance to ensure that the
high level of liquidity does not weaken credit practices will be needed. Moving forward with land
sales would strengthen banks’ balance sheets, while securing the gains from debt restructuring and
spurring growth. The dividend agreement with banks should be extended to allow more time to
develop a comprehensive plan that would support long-term growth through the wider deployment
of otherwise idle lands, while progress is made on a case by case basis.

Implementing growth enhancing measures is key to sustaining high growth over the
medium-term. The current strength of the economic recovery provides an opportunity to
undertake important reforms, including implementing the tourism master plan to enhance its value
added, taking concrete measures to improve the business climate, and investing in alternative
energy sources to reduce long-term energy costs.
28.
Weak data quality is of increasing concern. Accelerating efforts to improve economic
data is crucial to providing a better basis for policy decisions.
29.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on a standard 12-month
cycle. The PPM framework will continue until outstanding Fund credit falls below 200 percent of
quota, expected by May 2016, absent early repayment.

Medium-term

Annex I. St. Kitts and Nevis – Risk Assessment Matrix
Main Risks to Baseline Scenario

Likelihood

Impact

Policy Response

Escalation of financial sector stress in the ECCU. A
sudden loss of confidence could rapidly spill over
into other financial institutions. The limited lender of
last resort facility, given the currency board
arrangement, and the lack of deposit insurance
increase vulnerability. This could lead to increased
financial sector instability in the region, which could
impact St. Kitts and Nevis notwithstanding the
strength of its banking system.
Natural disasters. The high vulnerability to natural
disasters increases risks of substantial damage to
infrastructure, entailing large reconstruction costs.

High

High

Support the resolution of weak financial institutions
in the region by passing Monetary Council
approved legal reforms; and applying best practices
to restructure and resolve weak banks, including
private sector solutions. Strengthen contingency
planning.

Medium to
High

Medium
to High

Sharp drop in CBI receipts. The change in visa
requirements by Canada and possible adverse
actions by other advanced countries, together with
increasing competition of similar programs in other
countries, can rapidly reduce the number of
applicants to the CBI program and related inflows to
the budget and the SIDF. It would also reduce FDI to
construction and real estate.

Medium

High

Slow pace of land sales in the context of the
debt-for-land swap. St. Kitts and Nevis’ indigenous
banks may face risks to profitability and balance
sheet quality if a large stock of land remains unsold
at the end of the 3-year dividend arrangement with
the government.

High

Medium

Formulate adequate budgetary provisions for
disaster mitigation. Work with the World Bank and
other development partners to build resilience to
climate change.
Contain reliance on CBI revenues for government
spending and build precautionary balances by
saving the bulk of CBI receipts; strengthen due
diligence and oversight at both the national and
ECCU levels to reduce risks to financial integrity and
international security; devise a financial strategy to
ensure the medium-term viability of the SIDF.
Preserve the value of saved resources to use as
precautionary balances.
Authorize the Special Land Sales Company (St. Kitts)
to proceed with the sale of the bulk of the land
inventory and consider extending the 3-year

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in the
view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant
to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability of 30 percent or more).
The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually
exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.

Annex II. External Stability Assessment
St. Kitts and Nevis’ current account deficit is higher than implied by fundamentals, suggesting that the
exchange rate is overvalued. Competitiveness indicators – including the business climate and tourism
performance – suggest ongoing challenges. Recent appreciation of the US dollar, to which the East
Caribbean dollar is pegged, could further undermine St. Kitts and Nevis’ competitiveness. That said,
St Kitts and Nevis’ level of reserves is high, providing ample cushion for external shocks.

A. Current Account and Exchange Rate Assessment
1.
The structure of St. Kitts and Nevis as a small tourism-dependent state with large
inflows under the Citizenship-By-Investment (CBI) program presents unique challenges to
estimating its fundamentally-justified current account balance and currency valuation. For
St. Kitts and Nevis, the financing of its tourism-related infrastructure attracts and depends on
sizeable capital flows, notably foreign

Staff customized the EBA-lite methodology for tourism and CBI inflows. Specifically, a
dummy representing small tourism dependent countries is added to the model.1 The dummy is
significant and slope coefficients for other variables changed under this specification. Additionally,
the expected current account norm out to the medium term includes modest CBI inflows. Lastly, the
value against which the current account gap is calculated is an average of current account estimates
for 2014 and 2015 – this is done to smooth the expected impact of CBI inflows on the current
account balance, reflecting possible declines over the near term given heightened scrutiny to the
program. However, the projected current account deficit may be overstated since the staff’s forecast
for CBI service receipts in the medium-term is very modest while imports remain relatively high on

the assumption that FDI to the tourism sector will replace the bulk of the current CBI inflows to the
construction sector.

The adjusted EBA-lite model-based estimates suggest that the near-term forecast for
current account balance is below the level implied by fundamentals and that the REER is
overvalued. The current account balance, at -10.1 percent of GDP – using an average of 2014 and
2015 values to account for the possibility of a decline in CBI inflows in the near term –is lower than
the estimated “norm” of -3.5% based

Data shortcomings include: (i) outdated visitor expenditure survey information for the calculation of the tourism
receipts; (ii) incomplete information on impact of medical schools; (iii) and partial data on exports and imports. There
has not been a visitor survey for several years, and the BOP data are based on old estimates of visitor surveys that do
not take into account the change in the composition of visitors, nor their spending pattern. For example, the number
of visitors from the Caribbean has sharply dropped, while the number of visitors from advanced countries has
increased. The former spend a lot less than the latter. The BOP also does not capture the impact of the medical
schools, not in their spending, nor their role in FDI, nor in the net factor income.

dependent economies. An update to the Pineda et al (2009) approach suggests the degree of
misalignment is more modest. The staff’s medium-term CA forecast of -15.8 percent in 2020 is
slightly below the level of -12.2 percent implied by fundamentals. For the near term, the REER for
2014 is broadly in line with the model’s estimate (text chart, right hand side). The real effective
exchange rate remains appreciated relative to its competitors (text chart, left hand side). 5,6 The
recent appreciation of the US dollar—to which the East Caribbean dollar has been pegged since

reliance on tourism as the mainstay of its economy. Since 1990, the volatilities of tourism receipts
and FDI have both been about 5 percent of GDP, while imports have averaged slightly below 50
percent as a share of GDP. 8 An extreme shock to the current account – measured as a 2 standard
deviation event – would result in a swing of 20 percent of GDP, or about 5 months of coverage for
imports. By this measure, the current reserve coverage of 8.5 months for 2015 or nearly 35 percent
of GDP is adequate insurance (text chart). The ample reserve cushion is not surprising as recent
foreign currency inflows have boosted currency in circulation, raising St. Kitts and Nevis’ share of
imputed reserves at the ECCB. 9 Risks rest with the outlook for the currency union: vulnerable
members could destabilize the outlook for the union as a whole, and negatively affect more-robust
countries such as St. Kitts and Nevis.

This increase followed extensive consultations with stakeholders, and was endorsed by private
sector. It restored the real minimum wage back to the 2008 level, when it was last adjusted. It is now

Annex III. Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA)
Stronger growth in 2013 and 2014 and sizable advance repayments have improved the debt
outlook, although risk to debt sustainability remains high. The debt-to-GDP ratio declined to
79 percent of GDP at end-2014, compared to a forecast of 86.2 percent in the last program review,
and 100.8 percent at end-2013. Concrete plans for additional debt repayment underlie the further
rapid decline in the projected debt-to-GDP ratio, notwithstanding a weakening in the fiscal outlook on
account of new tax exemptions. The new policies combined with a cautious outlook for CBI budgetary
inflows risk depleting government buffers and a reversal of the debt-to-GDP in case of an exogenous
shock. Gross financing needs remains high on account of the large stock of T-bills that are assumed to
be rolled over.

A. Public Debt Sustainability Analysis 1
Background
1.
Public debt has significantly declined from 159 percent of GDP at end-2010 to 79
percent of GDP at end-2014. The bulk of the decline was achieved through restructuring of central
government and public sector enterprises domestic debt, equivalent to 34.6 percent of 2014 GDP
(or 43 percent of 2010 GDP) to the indigenous banking system. This took place through debt -land
swap operations in July 2013, and August and October 2014. Bilateral agreements with all Paris Club
creditors have been signed relating to the May 2012 agreement on debt equivalent to 0.8 percent of
GDP, yielding some debt forgiveness by one creditor and rescheduling by another. Discussions with
non-Paris club creditors, namely Kuwait, Taiwan POC and Venezuela have also advanced. In addition,
the authorities concluded a debt exchange with bondholders and commercial external creditors with
more favorable coupon rates in mid April 2012. In 2014, early repayments to the Fund equivalent to
2.6 percent of GDP further accelerated the decline in outstanding debt. There was also an advance
repayment to the SSB of 2.2 percent of GDP and to the Development Bank of St. Kitts and Nevis of
0.9 percent of GDP in August 2014.

Medium-Term Debt Sustainability Analysis
2.
The debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to decline faster than in last review (IMF Country
Report No. 14/297) falling to below the 60 percent target in 2017. Although the primary
balance has worsened from the last review on account of the widening of tax exemptions and
somewhat higher capital spending, accumulated public sector deposits allow the government to
meet its financing requirements and repay its debt. Moreover, the baseline scenario takes into
account the advance repayments planned by the government in 2015. CBI budgetary inflows are
projected to slow in 2015 and significantly decline thereafter to about 1.7 percent by 2020. The
specific assumptions are:

1

This annex presents an analysis of debt sustainability utilizing the new DSA framework for Market-Access Countries.

40

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ST. KITTS AND NEVIS



Fiscal Balance: The primary fiscal surplus drops from 13.8 percent of GDP in 2014 to 7.4 percent
of GDP in 2015, mainly because of the increased exemptions, and a drop in CBI budgetary
revenues. It further deteriorates to a deficit of 1.6 percent by 2020. CBI budgetary revenues are
assumed to decline from 14.1 percent of GDP in 2014 to 9.4 percent in 2015 and to 1.7 percent
by 2020.



Growth and Inflation: Real economic activity moderates somewhat to 5 percent in 2015,
3.5 percent in 2016, and stabilizes at its potential rate of 2.5 percent over the medium term,
while inflation averages 2.1 percent.



Debt: Authorities make advanced repayments in 2015 of around 5 percent of GDP, including to
the IMF, one bilateral creditor, and PDVSKN.2

3.
Despite the rapid reduction in debt-to-GDP ratio, the heat map and fan charts show
that risks to debt sustainability remain high. Notwithstanding the further projected decline in
debt, both the debt and the gross financing needs exceed the benchmark for emerging market
economies and will do so for some time. Moreover, under the various stress tests, debt declines
considerably more slowly than in the baseline scenario. The fan charts show the possible evolution
of the debt-to-GDP ratio over the medium term, based on both a symmetric and an asymmetric
distribution of risks. The asymmetric fan chart (where only negative shocks to growth and the
exchange rate are considered) shows that debt would go back up to 90 percent of GDP by 2020 if
economic conditions were to deteriorate significantly.
4.
There would not appear to be a systematic projection bias. The forecasts of real GDP
growth in 2008 to 2011 overestimated growth as a result of underestimating the severity of the
impact of the global financial crisis on tourism in ECCU countries. More recently, the staff’s
projections underestimated growth, with the rebound being much stronger than anticipated. In
addition, there are large forecast errors for the primary balance in 2011 to 2014 because the vast
increase in CBI inflows was unanticipated in 2010-12, while in 2013 and 2014 staff used a cautious
assumption about future inflows, given the uncertainty of these inflows. The inflation forecast errors
are comparable to that of other countries with Fund-supported programs, although the projection
for 2011 overestimated the impact of the introduction of the VAT on inflation.
5.
The cyclically adjusted primary balance in the forecast period reflects the assumption
that CBI inflows are not expected to continue at their current pace. The estimated change in the
cyclically adjusted primary surplus over the forecast period is at the lower end of the distribution of
adjustments historically achieved by advanced and emerging economies with debt greater than
60 percent of GDP. This reflects the baseline scenario’s cautious assumption for CBI inflows, and
thus, lower projections for non-tax revenues and primary surplus compared to the 2012-2014.
2

About 2.1 percent of GDP was already repaid to the Fund as of July 23, 2015. An agreement was also reached with
one non-Paris Club creditor in June 2015 on a flow restructure with a lower interest rate and longer maturity in line
with the 2012 Paris Club agreement.

6.
Under the baseline scenario the debt-to-GDP ratio falls to 60 percent by 2017,
reaching 52.1 percent of GDP by 2020. This path remains sensitive to shocks, especially if a
combination of them were to materialize.


Under a growth shock that lowers output by 4.5 percentage points (1 standard deviation of
growth over the past 10 years) relative to that projected in 2016 and 2017 and lowers inflation
by 1.1 percentage points in each year, debt would peak at 72 percent in 2017, about 13.2 points
higher than in the baseline.



A sustained interest rate shock of 463 bps (difference between the average real interest rate level
over the projection period and the maximum 10-year historical level) would slow down the rate
of debt decline in the medium term, so that by 2020 the debt-to-GDP ratio is 2.0 points higher
compared with the baseline.



A primary balance shock of 3.3 percentage points over 2016–17 (½ standard deviations of the
historical 10-year average) results in the debt-to-GDP ratio being 6.5 percentage points higher
in 2020 relative to the baseline.



A combined macro-fiscal shock of all of the above would lead to debt peaking at 79.1 percent of
GDP in 2017, 20.4 percentage points higher than under the baseline, before slowly declining to
72.6 percent in 2020.



A natural disaster shock that results in real GDP growth declining by 3 and 2 percentage points
in 2016 and 2017 compared to the baseline, and a deterioration in the primary balance of 5, 4,
and 2 percent of GDP in 2016, 2017 and 2018 respectively, would result in a debt-to-GDP ratio
of 64.9 percent by 2020, 12.8 percentage points above the baseline.



A contingent liability shock related to the debt-land swap, which would require the
recapitalization of banks up to required prudential limits, would slow the gross public debt
trajectory to 62.1 percent of GDP by 2020 and increases gross financing needs to 24.5 percent of
GDP. 3

7.
The historical and constant primary balance scenarios do not provide a reliable insight
into possible risk. The historical scenario takes into account several years of very high CBI
budgetary inflows combined with strong fiscal performance under the Fund supported program.
The scenario with a constant primary balance also reflects the very high CBI budgetary inflows.
While CBI inflows may continue to be stronger than under the staff’s cautious assumptions, such
large inflows could more than likely be used to support higher government spending.

3

This scenario assumes no land sales at the end of 3 years and that the total value of land previously transferred to
the Special Purpose Vehicle is written off from assets and registered as losses in the income statement, impacting
banks’ capital. Consequently, the amount of recapitalization of the banks that would be needed to meet the regional
CAR prudential requirement of 8 percent would be EC$253 million or 10 percent of GDP.

B. External Debt Sustainability Analysis
8.
St. Kitts and Nevis external public debt is projected to continue to decline relatively
rapidly over the medium term, but remains vulnerable to deterioration in the current account
balance. St. Kitts and Nevis’ external debt is expected to remain on a downward trend over the
medium term, falling to below 20 percent of GDP by 2017 and to below 15 percent by 2020. Lower
debt service resulting from the external debt restructuring and debt repayment, together with solid
FDI inflows would help finance the projected current account deficits. Stress tests indicate that
external debt would continue to decline under interest rate, growth, real depreciation and combined
shocks. However, debt stays relatively high under the current account shock scenario, suggesting
that some external adjustment would be necessary to bring the debt path back to a downward trend
under the shock.

3/ The cell is highlighted in green if country value is less than the lower risk-assessment benchmark, red if country value exceeds the upper risk-assessment benchmark,
yellow if country value is between the lower and upper risk-assessment benchmarks. If data are unavailable or indicator is not relevant, cell is white.
Lower and upper risk-assessment benchmarks are:
200 and 600 basis points for bond spreads; 5 and 15 percent of GDP for external financing requirement; 0.5 and 1 percent for change in the share of short-term debt; 15
and 45 percent for the public debt held by non-residents; and 20 and 60 percent for the share of foreign-currency denominated debt.
4/ St Kitts and Nevis is not rated by the credit rating agencies, and no bond spread information is available
5/ External financing requirement is defined as the sum of current account deficit, amortization of medium and long-term total external debt, and short-term total external
debt at the end of previous period.

1/ Public sector is defined as consolidated public sector, including 14 public enterprises.
2/ Based on available data.
3/ Defined as interest payments divided by debt stock (excluding guarantees) at the end of previous year.
4/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;
a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
5/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
6/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as ae(1+r).
7/ Includes asset changes and interest revenues (if any). For projections, includes exchange rate changes during the projection period. The residual negative effect on debt
creating flows in 2012, 2013 and 2014 includes the impact of the debt forgiveness on the stock of debt.
8/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

9.4 percent of GDP in 2013, before moderating somewhat in 2014 to 7.1 percent of GDP, putting the
overall balance at 1.8 percent of GDP in 2014, compared to 8.9 percent in 2012. The large increase in
grants and investment proceeds to government together with the expansion of social spending
underpin the large increase in expenditure in 2013. Support to the government substantially
declined in 2014.
3.
SIDF finances a wide range of social and economic programs. Spending on social
programs increased to 3.6 percent of GDP in 2014. The main increase was related to the People
Employment Program (PEP), which rose by a third, reflecting a large increase in the average number
of trainees over the year, from 2,148 to 3,481 per month. Additionally, funds were made available to
SKELEC to subsidize energy consumption.5

The consolidated position of
the public sector, taking into account
SIDF activity, suggests a stronger
public sector position than otherwise.
Adding SIDF revenues, net of flows that
are already incorporated into the
budget, boosts the consolidated surplus
to 11.3 percent of GDP. Nonetheless,
this is a weaker position than in 2013,
reflecting lower government grants, and
lower SIDF revenues and higher SIDF
spending. Including estimates of the
performance of the public enterprises,
the deterioration was even greater.

5.
Strengthening of SIDF management and its integration with the government accounts
should be a high priority. Given the amount of assets that is under its purview, financial reporting
of the SIDF needs to be strengthened with improved monitoring of its asset-liability position.
Establishing rigorous and transparent financial guidelines is essential in light of increasing financial
challenges going forward, as revenues are likely to continue to decline, while there is no clear
operational framework to contain expenditures. Also, the bulk of SIDF loans are to the central
government and public sector enterprises, yet some of these are not being serviced, and the debtors
may consider them to be grants. Other assets have a limited income stream associated with them.
SIDF has not published audited financial statements since 2011, and a financial audit for 2013 has
just begun. Curtailing its quasi-fiscal activities is also necessary to bring its expenditures under
control and ensure its sustainability. Transfers from the SIDF to the budget should also be limited,
and be subject to clear rules, to ensure that the government operates with a clearly defined budget
constraint and that the PSIP is not modified to include low priority projects. Related, the selection of
SIDF investment projects, whether in the public or private domain, needs to be transparent and
based on sound economic returns. Finally, SIDF financial statements should be annually audited and
released to the public on a timely basis. Over the medium-term, the government should seek to
integrate its activities with the government and its savings should be managed together with CBI
savings in a unified investment framework.

Annex V. Overview of the Energy Sector in St. Kitts and Nevis
1.
Like other ECCU countries, St. Kitts and Nevis faces significant energy sector
challenges. These are largely attributed to constraints of limited generation capacity, isolated grids,
and high generation costs as a result of old and undiversified generation technology. The high fuel
prices had also been a major contributor to the higher energy costs, with negative implications for
economic activity and competitiveness. Fuel import cost doubled from a decade ago to reach an
average of 5.0 percent of GDP over 2011-2014, compared to an average of 2.4 percent over 19952005.

2.
With around 95 percent of generation capacity fueled by diesel, electricity prices in
the Federation have been influenced by high and volatile oil prices. Tariff rates reached an
average of US$0.37/kWh for the Federation in 2012 putting the national electricity bill burden at
around 6.5 percent of GDP. This raises the cost of doing business and increases uncertainty of
investment planning with around 64 percent

tariff rates dropped to US$0.26/kWh in
2015, and the magnitude of the energy subsidies have significantly declined.

3.
A segmented and under-regulated energy sector represents a key challenge. The twoisland federation has separate government-owned electric utilities that operate independently with
separate grid networks. It also has separate regulatory frameworks with each island retaining the
right to make its own legislation for its electric power sector. In St. Kitts, SKELEC has the exclusive
right to produce, transmit and distribute electricity following its corporatization in August 2011. In
Nevis, NEVLEC is also the sole provider of electricity on the island and is wholly owned by the Nevis
Island Administration after being corporatized in September 2000. Both the Electricity Supply Act
(2011) for St. Kitts and the Electricity Supply Act of Nevis (1998) for Nevis stipulate that a Public
Utilities Commission (PUC) is responsible for regulating the sector; however, no such body exists in
either island.2
1

World Bank, “Enterprise Surveys St. Kitts and Nevis (2010)”.

SKELEC is regulated by the Governor General on an as needed basis, while NEVLEC is largely self-regulated, setting its own tariffs
and fuel surcharges.

54 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ST. KITTS AND NEVIS

4.
The government has tried to address some of operational challenges in the electricity
sector. The Electricity Department was incorporated as SKELEC in 2011 with the intention of
strengthening its financial operations and energy sector performance. However, the absence of
financial statements for SKELEC since its incorporation makes concrete assessments of its financial
position difficult. Although SKELEC implemented plans to reduce losses through smart metering and
billing system upgrade, challenges remain because of legacy issues, poor collection on bills, theft
and inefficiencies in generation and distribution. Efforts to settle remaining public sector arrears
owed to SKELEC and enforcing a system of timely bill collection will enhance financial viability and
facilitate capital investment and maintenance to boost operating efficiency. NEVLEC also faces
challenges in fully recovering costs through tariffs and its recent financial reports are not available.
5.
A comprehensive strategy is needed to ensure a sustainable energy future. A new draft
of the National Energy Policy, with its associated action plan, is being finalized, placing emphasis on
the accelerated deployment of renewable energy technology, particularly geothermal power, and
identifies a renewable energy target for the electricity sector of 100 percent by 2020. The policy also
outlines measures for improving energy efficiency and the institutional framework of the power
sector. In addition, several government-sponsored initiatives to diversify the energy matrix away
from fossil fuels have been launched or are in the planning stage. For example, Nevis began
operating the first utility-scale wind farm (2.2 MW) in the OECS in 2010, while a recently completed
1 MW solar power plant in St. Kitts, developed in partnership with Taiwan, powers the country’s
international airport. Meanwhile, NIA is in final negotiations with an international consortium to
develop a 10 MW geothermal power plant in Nevis, with potential for expansion to export electricity
to St. Kitts and other neighboring islands. Setting the appropriate legal framework and regulatory
environment, including the introduction of net billing schemes or feed-in tariffs, will help attract
more private sector investments to the renewable energy sector. Nevertheless, the viability of
alternative energy projects needs to be reassessed in light of recent shifts in the global oil market
outlook.

Exchange Arrangement
St. Kitts and Nevis is a member of the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB), which manages
monetary policy and the exchange system for its eight members. The common currency, the
Eastern Caribbean dollar, has been pegged to the U.S. dollar at the rate of EC$2.70 per U.S.
dollar since July 1976. The de jure regime is a currency board, which in practice the ECCB has
operated like a quasi-currency board, maintaining foreign exchange backing of its currency
and demand liabilities close to 100 percent. St. Kitts and Nevis accepted the obligations of
Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 in December 1984. The exchange system is free of restrictions
on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions.
Safeguards Assessment
Under the Fund's safeguards assessment policy, the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB) is
subject to a full safeguards assessment on a four year cycle. The most recent assessment was
completed on April 16, 2012 and did not identify any significant safeguards risks. The
assessment made some recommendations to sustain and advance the ECCB's safeguards
framework going forward. The authorities broadly agreed with the recommendations and have
commenced implementation.
Last Article IV Consultation
The last Article IV staff report (IMF Country Report No. 14/86) was issued on March 5, 2014.
Board discussion took place on March 19, 2014. Article IV consultations take place on a 12month cycle.

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
(As of May 30, 2015)
World Bank Group OECS Regional Partnership Strategy. The Board of the Executive Directors of
the World Bank Group endorsed the new OECS Regional Partnership Strategy (RPS) November 13,
2014, which covers the period FY15-19. The high-level objective of the new RPS is to contribute to
laying down the foundations for sustainable inclusive growth, in line with the OECS governments’
priorities. In order to achieve this goal, the program will be organized around three main areas of
engagement. Under the first one, the WBG will support “competitiveness”. Growth and job creation
in the private sector will be supported both horizontally – by improving the business environment–
and vertically – by focusing on specific sectors with a high potential to generate inclusive sustainable
growth (particularly tourism, agribusiness and their respective linkages). The second area of
engagement is “public sector modernization”, with particular focus on public financial management
(PFM) and institutional capacity, including for statistics and public private partnerships (PPPs), to
better leverage private investment in infrastructure and service provision. The third area is
“resilience”, with the objective to address both social vulnerabilities (in education, health and social
protection), and exposure to natural disasters. Constrained in general by the small size of
investments in the OECS, the IFC and MIGA will contribute to the RPS objectives through selective
investment support, depending on opportunities. The IFC will focus on crisis response; job creation
and inclusive growth; innovation, competitiveness, and integration; and climate change. MIGA faces
limited opportunities for engagement because of the small market size of the OECS countries.
The RPS is grounded in a holistic approach to tackling the long-standing issues of low growth
and debt sustainability in the Caribbean. This is approach is the Comprehensive Debt Framework
(CDF), which was developed in 2010 by the Bank at the request of the Heads of Government of
CARICOM countries. Structured around four pillars, the CDF is designed to address the
interdependent structural causes of high debt and low growth in small island states by (i) promoting
private-sector led growth, (ii) strengthening fiscal management, (iii) building resilience to natural
disasters, and (iv) improving debt management. Governments of the OECS recognize the
multifaceted nature of the challenges they face and understand that improvements in
competitiveness, reduction in sovereign debt levels, fiscal adjustments to ensure macro
sustainability, and enhanced sustainability and resilience to shocks are interrelated aspects that are
critical to resume and sustain inclusive growth. As a result, they have used the CDF to frame their
own reform strategies and activities.
The indicative IBRD lending program. For the six OECS countries, it is expected to be around
US$120 million, or up to a maximum of US$20 million for each OECS country for the period of the
RPS (FY15-19), subject to country and program performance, IBRD’s lending capacity, and exposure
management parameters. In addition to the IBRD envelope, four OECS countries (Dominica,
Grenada, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines) can also count on an IDA national allocation.

6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ST. KITTS AND NEVIS

The IDA17 (FY15-17) allocation for the OECS is equal to SDR61.3 million, an increase of around 22
percent over the IDA16 OECS allocation (SDR50.3 million).

A. Projects
St. Kitts and Nevis, because of its income status, is not eligible to IDA resources. Its indicative
IBRD allocation for the period covered by the RPS FY15-19 is US$20 million. As of today, there are
no active lending operations in St. Kitts and Nevis. This is due, in part, to the high debt level
situation of the country and the lack of availability of concessional resources.
The WBG engagement is limited to the implementation of a grant which has the objective to
enhance Public Sector Governance and Efficiency. This operation (US$ 415,000) is financed by a
grant from the Institutional Development Fund (IDF), a World Bank’s financing tool to enhance the
delivery and implementation of programs that will lead ultimately to better development results.
The objective of this project is to increase the quality of expenditures and public sector efficiency
and promote a fiscally sustainable and more equitable system of pay and employment which
generates the right incentives to improve public sector performance in St. Kitts and Nevis. This will
be done through building capacity at the Ministry of Finance by working with government teams to:
(i) implement measures to rapidly increase the efficiency of personnel expenditures; (ii) align human
resource needs and staffing in St. Kitts and Nevis public service through the implementation of
recommendations of functional reviews; and (iii) introduce pay classification and evaluations. The
project is expected to close in October 2015.
The government of St. Kitts and Nevis launched its national chapter of the Caribbean Growth
Forum (CGF) in February 2013. The CGF is an initiative led by the World Bank, the Inter-American
Development Bank, and the Caribbean Development Bank, in collaboration with the United
Kingdom Agency for International Development (DFID) and the Canadian Department of Foreign
Affairs, to identify policies and initiatives aimed at inducing growth and creating jobs in the
Caribbean region through analytical work, knowledge exchange and inclusive dialogue. The CGF can
contribute to an enhanced and participatory policy dialogue (involving the private sector, CSOs, and
other non-traditional stakeholders, such as youth and Diaspora) on key challenges that affect
economic growth, in a situation where fiscal space is limited and the need to promote a more
diversified knowledge-based economy is pressing. The CGF national chapters have been launched in
12 Caribbean countries, including all the six OECS countries.

B. Economic and Sector Work
The Bank has completed a series of analytical products relating to public expenditure, fiscal
and debt sustainability, growth and competitiveness, the financial sector, public sector
management and social protection. The ongoing dissemination of these reports represents a key
instrument for policy dialogue with the OECS governments, including St. Kitts and Nevis. The Bank’s
program in St. Kitts and Nevis is further supported by a comprehensive series of analytical and
advisory activities, including the following: “Towards a New Agenda for Growth” – OECS growth and

RELATIONS WITH THE CARIBBEAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
(As of December 31, 2014)
Over the years, the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) has supported the economic and
social development of St. Kitts and Nevis, by providing financing for priority capital and
technical (TA) projects. In addition, CDB has engaged in policy dialogue with the Government of
St. Kitts and Nevis. CDB’s involvement with SKN has been concerned with activities such as: the
formulation and implementation of macroeconomic, social and sectoral policies; development of
infrastructure to facilitate growth and economic diversification; direct and indirect lending to
agriculture; and emergency rehabilitation.
In December, 2012, CDB approved a new assistance strategy for St. Kitts and Nevis for the
period 2013-16. The strategy focuses on establishing an enabling environment for sustained
inclusive growth and poverty reduction and strengthening resilience by securing social stability and
improving environmental sustainability. The indicative list of interventions contained in the
assistance strategy is expected to result in a lending program of up to US$42.7mn over the strategy
period. At the end of 2014, CDB had approved loans totaling US$149.7mn to St. Kitts and Nevis, of
which US$3.0mn were undisbursed.
The Nevis Water Supply Enhancement is the only major project currently under
implementation. The project aims to assist in improving the water supply network capacity on the
island of Nevis. Under the project, approximately 20 kilometers of pipelines, two pumping stations
and storage capacity of 1.0 million gallons will be constructed. The project also provides for capacity
building and strengthening institutional arrangements for the delivery of water services.
The 2014 reporting period saw significant progress on all three major capital contracts and
engagement of the Water Resource Management TA Consultant. The tank installation is
approximately 80% complete and the pumping stations 90% completed. Ninety per cent of the pipe
material was delivered and the laying of mains by the Nevis Water Department commenced.
Disbursement totaled $5.447mn, approximately 63% of the loan amount of $8.425mn. Based on the
amounts outstanding on existing contracts and projected activities, the project will be completed
approximately $1.0mn below budget.
Three other projects were previously in the pipeline in 2013. (i) The Sixth Student loan was
terminated by the borrower, the St. Kitts-Nevis-Anguilla National Bank, and all monies owing to CDB
were repaid; (ii) the works funded by the Immediate Response Loan for Tropical Storm Otto were
completed under budget and the balance of the loan was cancelled; (iii) the Second Power Project
for Nevis which included the installation of a generator of 2.5mw, ancillary switchgear and an
operations facility was cancelled.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance, although there are significant shortcomings in
data provision and data quality.
Real Sector
Methodological deficiencies are present in the real sector statistics. GDP figures rely on the
production approach, both in constant and current prices. Limited survey data hinder the
assessments of value-added for each sector with some sectors suffering from significant weaknesses
in estimation methodology. On the expenditure of GDP, which is available only at current prices, the
aggregate final private consumption expenditure is derived as a residual. This residual includes
households and NPISH final consumption expenditures, and changes in inventories. Weaknesses are
observed in the methods to estimate gross capital formation. CPI only covers St. Kitts but not Nevis
although the information is available. Monthly CPI data are posted on the ECCB website with a long
lag, and a break in the series in November 2010 suggests a methodological problem in the linking
process with the previous base. The ECCB disseminated monthly data on tourism also with a long
lag, and the estimates on tourism expenditure are based on an old survey of spending by types of
tourists and are only updated by changes in CPI. Except for data from the social security board,
limited data are available on labor market developments.
Government Finance Statistics
St. Kitts and Nevis has reported to STA quarterly government finance statistics (GFS) up to 2014Q1
and annual GFS up to 2012 on main aggregates and their components for revenue, expense, and
financing of the budgetary central government. Extra-budgetary units are included in budgetary
central government. Accounts for the public enterprises are only available with a long lag. There are
also limited accounts provided on the activities of the Sugar Investment Diversification Foundation,
although it is playing an incremental role in fiscal policy. Progress has been made in reducing
discrepancies between overall balance and available financing in 2013 but further work is needed to
resolve discrepancies in earlier years. Government finance data are recorded by the authorities on a
cash basis, and reported to the Fund based on a Chart of Accounts broadly in line with the GFSM
1986 classifications. Efforts to report the government financial balance sheet, particularly the main
liabilities (loans and debt securities), will strengthen the fiscal data for surveillance purposes. In
implementing the GFSM 2014, the authorities should consider making selective adjustments to the
current cash accounting, as relevant, in the following categories: arrears, debt reorganization,
transactions in kind, and interest.

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ST. KITTS AND NEVIS

External Sector Statistics
The ECCB reports annual balance of payments data of its eight members (including St. Kitts and
Nevis) for publication in the Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook (BOPSY) and the International
Financial Statistics (IFS). The compilation of balance of payments statistics for the ECCU and member
states is a joint exercise between the ECCB and its members. The quality of major components of the
balance of payments in the region needs substantial improvement, including the recording of goods
imports, travel credits, private transfers, and direct investment transactions. There is also need to
compile private sector external debt data. CARTAC is providing technical assistance to the ECCB and
the member economies to improve the quality of external sector statistics and to introduce the new
survey instruments. The new survey forms are aligned with the sixth edition of the Balance of
Payments and International Investment Position Statistics Manual (BPM6) and also will collect, for the
first time, data for the production of international investment position (IIP) statistics. St. Kitts and
Nevis does not report external debt data to the Quarterly External Debt Statistics (QEDS) database.
Monetary and Financial Statistics
Monetary statistics have been compiled and reported to the Fund by the ECCB on a monthly basis
based on a standardized report form since July 2006, with a timeliness of approximately two months
after the reference month. The institutional coverage of monetary statistics needs to be improved by
including the accounts of nonbank deposit takers licensed by the ECCB, credit unions, and other
financial corporations. In this respect, close coordination between the ECCB and the Financial
Services Regulatory Commission (which is supervising financial institutions not licensed by the ECCB
under the Banking Act) is crucial. Financial Soundness Indicators (FSIs) for the ECCU area are not
published. While noting some improvements, the 2014 monetary and financial statistics (MFS)
technical assistance mission that visited the ECCB identified the following main shortcomings in the
ECCB’s monetary statistics: (i) the methodological soundness of monetary statistics can be improved
by expanding institutional coverage (particularly of the other depository corporations (ODC) sector),
and revising the classifications of some financial instruments and sectors to align the reporting to
international standards; (ii) transparency can be improved by adopting a single monetary survey for
publication on the ECCB website and in IFS, to be released to all users at the same time; (iii) the
timeliness of the dissemination of data on broad money and credit aggregates can be improved to
meet best international practices; and (iv) the access to officially disseminated data and metadata
can be improved.
II. Data Standards and Quality

St. Kitts and Nevis participates in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) since October
2000, and its metadata are posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB). The
metadata for the financial sector was updated in 2012 while the metadata for the real, fiscal, and
external sectors, has not been updated since the country joined GDDS. A Report on the Monetary
Statistics Component of the Regional Data Module Report on Observance of Standards and Codes
(ROSC) for the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB) was published in 2007.

Statement by the Staff Representative on St. Kitts and Nevis
August 31, 2015

This statement reports on information that has become available since the Staff Report was
issued on August 04, 2015. The information does not alter the thrust of the Staff Appraisal.
1.

Preliminary fiscal data for 1H2015 suggest that fiscal performance remains
broadly in line with expectations. Tax revenues grew 8.6 percent compared to
1H2014, 3.5 percent higher than projected, mainly on the back of improved income tax
collection and one-off corporate tax settlements. Current and capital expenditure were
broadly in line with staff projections, albeit with a slower-than-expected execution of
the capital budget in Nevis.

2.

Citizenship-by-investment inflows to the budget substantially slowed in 2Q2015.
This reflects ongoing reforms to the program and the impact of the loss of the visa free
access to Canada. However, data on the inflows in July 2015 suggest a recovery of the
pace of applications to that of July 2014. Cumulative inflows to the budget through July
2015 reached EC$162 million, compared to EC$185 million in July 2014.

3.

The National Assembly passed the New ECCU Banking Act 2015 on July 29
without amendments. The legislation allows for necessary reforms to strengthen the
bank supervision and resolution framework and create a regional asset management
company and will facilitate the regional financial sector resolution strategy. Unanimous
ratification by ECCU member states is required. St. Kitts and Nevis was the last of the
independent ECCU states to pass the law. The Bill is still being discussed in Anguilla
and Montserrat, the two British dependencies, with no timeline as to when it would be
passed.

4.

The authorities have made an early repurchase of SDR4.20 million, equivalent to
47.2 percent of quota, on July 27. This, together with prior early repayments
(equivalent to 282 percent of quota), have reduced Fund credit outstanding to
SDR 22.35 million (or 251 percent of quota) as of July 31, 2015. Absent additional
early repayments, St. Kitts and Nevis is expected to remain under the Post-Program
Monitoring framework till May 2016.
