STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
November 13, 2014

KEY ISSUES
Context: The economy is recovering slowly, driven mostly by private consumption and
non-oil-and gas exports. Employment is increasing and unemployment has been
trending downward slightly over the past year.
Macroeconomic policy: The exchange rate peg to the euro has served Denmark well.
Fiscal policy turned slightly supportive in 2014 after a substantial consolidation in 2013.
The government’s fiscal stance for 2015 and the medium term imply a slightly negative
fiscal impulse and are broadly appropriate in light of the expected gradual recovery.
Financial Sector Policy: Stress tests conducted as part of the IMF Financial Sector
Assessment Program (FSAP) found that financial stability risks are contained. Important
policy actions have helped to safeguard financial stability but the large size and high
domestic interconnectedness of the financial system require even greater resilience and
further measures are needed to reduce risks.
Household Debt and House Prices: Some features of tax, rental market, and financial
sector policy should be reconsidered in order to limit house price volatility and to
prevent excessive debt accumulation in the future. Specifically, the proposed new
supervisory guidelines for mortgage credit institutions should be complemented by
reduced tax preferences for housing and less rigid rental market regulations.
Productivity and labor market reforms: The government has included reforms in
Growth Plan 2014 as a first response to the recommendations of the Productivity
Commission. A continued consideration of reforms, including all of the remaining
recommendations by the Commission, would be welcome. Increasing labor market
participation is a high priority given the fiscal burden of an aging population and the
recent actions by the government to address labor market challenges are welcome.

CONTEXT: DENMARK ON A SLOW RECOVERY TRACK
1.
The Danish economy is recovering,
albeit slowly. The economy contracted slightly
(by 0.1 percent) in 2013, but it looks likely to
accelerate modestly in 2014. Growth is
supported by private domestic demand, but
held back by a trend decline in North Sea oil
and gas production (Box 1) as well as a decline
in net exports to euro-area partners
(particularly in the first half of 2014).
Unemployment continued its slow decline.

2.
Inflation and interest rates remain
low. Domestic inflation is about 1.5 percent (yoy) through 2014 H1 even though lower or negative
inflation from imports holds down the broader indices. Wage growth has moderated but remains
positive. Real interest rates continue to stay at or below zero for most short-term rates, and treasury
bill rates remain negative in nominal terms out to a two-year maturity, as is the case in Germany.
3.
Household indebtedness remains
high. House prices have been gradually
picking up since 2012, although slowly and
with substantial geographic variation. Driven
mostly by mortgage debt, Danish households
have the highest debt relative to disposable
income in the OECD, at roughly 300 percent in
2013. Even though households have
substantial assets and positive net worth, the
assets are predominantly non-liquid holdings
in the form of pension savings and housing
assets. However, households have been
rebuilding balance sheets and net wealth has
been rising for the past year.

GDP. Private sector investment dropped considerably after the crisis and has not yet recovered. This
has been a drag on the recovery and investment is expected to recover only gradually.
5.
The exchange rate is broadly in
line with fundamentals. The External
Balance Assessment (EBA) estimates indicate
moderate undervaluation on balance (Box
2). Even though unit labor costs are elevated
in Denmark and productivity growth is low
compared to the historical average, the
economy’s external competitiveness has
been maintained through improved terms of
trade. This is also reflected in the current
account surplus and the strong positive IIP
position.

Box 2. External Sustainability Assessment and the Equilibrium Exchange Rate
Denmark maintains a tight peg with the euro; however, since its 2009 trough the krone has appreciated in

estimates are mixed: the REER
approach supports the view that
the krone is broadly in line with
fundamentals and desirable
policies, while the
macroeconomic balance
approach and external

sustainability model suggest some undervaluation implied by the current account surplus. Exports of both
goods and services have contributed to the strong current account position, reflecting Danish specialization
in exports (e.g., design and pharmaceutical) that have benefited from rising prices.

One factor not taken into account in EBA estimates is Denmark’s substantial merchanting trade defined as
goods trade that does not cross the border of the firm’s resident country. Merchanting trade has shown
empirically to be an important driver of the current account, because merchanting firms reinvest their
earnings abroad to expand their international activates, raising national savings in the home country without
increasing domestic investment.1
The net international investment position (excluding the central bank) reached about 40 percent of GDP in
2013, and net foreign exchange reserves are about one quarter of GDP.

6.
The general government balance went from surpluses before the crisis to a deficit. The
deficit peaked at 3.9 percent of GDP in 2012, before being contained to 0.9 percent of GDP in 2013
to meet the requirements for exiting the Excessive Deficit Procedure (EDP) for a consolidation of the
structural deficit by 1.5 percent from 2010 to 2013.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS: THE ECONOMY IS
REBOUNDING BUT RISKS REMAIN
7.
Prospects for sustained recovery are good as some previous headwinds abate. Activity
is picking up in Denmark, driven mainly by private consumption and non-oil exports. Private
consumption is supported by improved consumer confidence (Figure 1) and a gradual restoration of
household balance sheets. Household net worth relative to disposable income has recovered much
of its post-crisis decline with house prices rising since 2012, several years of elevated savings rates,
and strong returns on financial assets (Figure 2 and Selected Issues, Chapter 1). Growth is projected
at 0.7 and 1.4 percent in 2014 and 2015, respectively, rising slightly above 2 percent in the mediumterm. Inflation is projected to increase even though external disinflationary pressures persist.
Unemployment is expected to continue its slow decline and the output gap will close gradually after
2018.
8.
Some factors that had held back growth are receding. The substantial fiscal consolidation
in 2013 has concluded and the process of rebuilding fiscal buffers will require much more modest
consolidation over the medium term. Household balance sheets are in a better position as savings
have rebuilt net wealth and house prices are rebounding. Growth has also picked up in the major
non-euro-area export markets (Norway, Sweden, the U.K., and the U.S.) and is expected to continue.
9.

However, downside risks remain.



Lower growth in advanced economies and emerging markets could slow the recovery by
depressing Denmark’s geographically-dispersed exports of goods and services.



Surges in global financial markets volatility (from a disorderly UMP exit or other causes) that
lead to a spike in market interest rates could depress consumption as households’ cash flow is
diverted to higher debt service on adjustable rate mortgages.



A protracted period of low euro area interest rates as the Danish economy recovers could
create overheating pressures and overvalued asset prices.



A drop in confidence in Danish covered bonds could depress consumption through higher
debt service on adjustable rate mortgages. While this is a very low probability event, the
importance of the mortgage covered bond market in Denmark’s financial system and the
relatively direct pass-through of shocks to mortgage covered bond interest rates to

High
Protracted period of slower growth in
advanced and emerging economies:



Advanced economies: Lower-thananticipated potential growth and
persistently low inflation due to a failure
to fully address legacies of the financial
crisis, leading to secular stagnation.



Emerging markets: Maturing of the
cycle, misallocation of investment, and
incomplete structural reforms leading to
prolonged slower growth.

Policy response

Expected Impact if Risk is Realized
(High, medium, or low)
Medium



To the extent that the recovery allows, start building fiscal space. When this risk materializes, allow
automatic stabilizers to operate and focus on structural reforms to improve the growth potential.

Medium/ High
Side-effects from global financial
conditions:
•
Financial imbalances from
protracted period of low interest rates
continue to build: excess leverage,
especially for corporates; asset price bubbles;
delays in fiscal and structural reforms.

Medium



If low interest rates persist while the Danish economy continues to
recover, vulnerabilities could build up. This could create
overheating pressures in asset markets, particularly on the housing
market.



Surges in global financial market volatility would affect Denmark if
it results in an interest rate hike. This could lead to considerable
burden on households as the majority of mortgages have variable
interest rates. As households’ cash flow is diverted to higher debt
service on adjustable rate mortgages, consumption dampened
which would in turn slow or reverse the recovery.

•
An abrupt surge in global
financial market volatility, as investors
reassess underlying risk.
Policy response

Maintain a gradual pace of fiscal consolidation. Reduce vulnerabilities of the financial sector by fully
implementing the macroprudential toolkit and move ahead with financial sector reforms. In
addition, reduce vulnerabilities in the household sector by building household buffers.

Low
A drop in confidence in Danish covered
bonds

Policy response

Given Denmark’s geographically dispersed exports, slower growth
in advanced economies and emerging markets to a significant
extent would weaken exports and lower domestic demand.

High



If materialized, this risk could lead to a reassessment of household
credit quality (possibly due to the rise in impaired loans) which
could increase concerns about the soundness as well as safety of
mortgage credit institutions and hence about covered bonds which
could depress consumption through higher interest rates and put
downward pressures on house prices.

Use regulatory policies to encourage longer bond maturities, ensure that eventual interest-rate
increases are better reflected in loan pricing and approvals, and increase buffers in loans with
interest-only periods, e.g., by reducing the loan-to-value (LTV) ceiling.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in the view
of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to
indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability between 30 and 50
percent). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Nonmutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.

household debt service would have a much larger impact than a similarly-proportioned shock to
covered bond markets in other countries.1


The Nordic-Baltic financial system is tightly integrated and problems elsewhere in the region
would spill over into Denmark, most directly from the overseas operations of the dominant
Danish-headquartered banking group (Danske Bank) or through the Danish subsidiary of the
Swedish-headquartered Nordea Bank (the second largest bank in Denmark). Outward spillovers
in the financial system would most likely propagate through the same two banking groups.2

Authorities’ views
10.
The authorities generally agreed with the outlook and the risk assessment. However,
there was a range of views on the speed at which the output gap is likely to close on both sides of
staff estimates. They concurred with staff that global shocks would affect Denmark mostly through
trade and interest rates, although the latter effect would possibly be beneficial due to safe-haven
inflows. They also agreed that housing prices and related household debt levels present complex
risks. However, the authorities stressed that they consider those risks contained at present but will
continue monitoring developments closely. Furthermore, the authorities consider that current low
inflation is not a sign of deflationary pressures in the Danish economy. While prices of imports and
import-competing goods are falling, domestic prices and wages are showing modest growth.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS: MAINTAINING A STEADY
RECOVERY
The nascent recovery provides an opportunity to start rebuilding fiscal buffers as conditions permit.
Also, while substantial progress has been made in strengthening the financial system, reforms should
continue in order to strengthen it, given its large size as well as the high domestic and regional
interconnectedness. Related to this, household debt and large household balance sheets create
vulnerabilities for the real economy; reducing distortions in the housing market that promote excessive
leverage and volatility would be helpful. Furthermore, there is scope for continued structural reforms to
promote productivity as well as to increase labor force participation rates.

A. Macroeconomic Policy
11.
Monetary policy is based on maintaining the very tight peg to the euro in the context
of a fully open capital account. This was tested during the crisis and it served the authorities well.
International reserves fell sharply at the peak of the crisis, dropping by 17 percent in October 2008

alone. However, exchange rate pressures quickly reversed and safe-haven inflows led to a large
accumulation of foreign exchange that has raised international reserves to more than double the
pre-crisis levels. To counter safe-haven inflows, the Danmarks Nationalbank cut policy interest rates
and put one deposit rate at a negative level from July 2012 through early 2014. After exiting this
period of negative rates, the Nationalbank once again set one of the policy rates at a negative value
in September 2014 following the ECB decision to implement its own negative policy rate (Box 3).
12.
The measured fiscal impulse is expected to be slightly contractionary in 2015, but
assessment of the broader fiscal stance is complicated by one-off measures and uncertainty
around the estimated potential growth. The general government headline balance stood at -0.8
percent of GDP in 2013, and is expected to widen to -1.2 and -2.5 percent in 2014 and 2015
respectively, with the widening accounted for by expiring one-off measures from 2013 and 2014.
Without the one-off measures, the headline balance would remain largely unchanged at around 3
percent in all three years. Nevertheless, the structural deficit is projected to widen slightly in 2014
before starting a gradual decline in 2015, suggesting that the fiscal impulse for 2015 is slightly
contractionary. In the medium to long term, the government plans a gradual tightening of the
structural balance. Both revenue and expenditure decline as a share of GDP between 2014 and 2019,
with the slightly larger expenditure decline producing the consolidation (Tables 1, 2, and 3). The
decline in revenue share is driven by a projected decline in tax revenue from pensions and, to a
lesser extent, a reduction in corporate income tax rates. The reduction in expenditures is driven
primarily by expenditure ceilings on public consumption and declining social benefits as the
economy recovers and reforms begin to reduce the number of beneficiaries (Annex I). Alternative
approaches to estimation of potential output and structural deficits produce estimates that vary
widely although the implied fiscal impulse is largely the same across the different approaches
(Selected Issues, Chapter 2).3
13.
The 2015 fiscal stance seems appropriate after the policies announced in October. The
August 2014 budget plans left too little room against the 3.0 percent of GDP deficit target, and
looked likely to exceed the ceiling once subsequent GDP data were taken into account. Therefore,
the government announced additional, one-off pension tax measures in October 2014 which should
result in a somewhat tighter headline fiscal position in 2015 that builds in a buffer with respect to the
limit in the event of negative developments in the economy.4 A focus of the government’s budgetary
adjustment has been to meet the deficit targets while minimizing the negative effects on the
3

For example, the Ministry of Finance uses an approach to calculate the cycle that, inter alia, excludes resource
revenue (see Box 1) and other elements of output that would be captured by standard methods of estimating
potential output (including those used in the Fund), but would not seem related to the domestic business cycle.
4

The government is extending a 2013-14 window to convert certain pension assets into from taxable to tax-free
status upon withdrawal into 2015 as well as allowing the withdrawal of some pension assets paid in during the 1970s.
A discounted rate of taxation applies to incentivize the conversion or withdrawal and generate current tax revenues.
Because the former measure represents a transfer between categories of illiquid pension assets it is likely to have little
effect on demand. The latter measure frees up previously sequestered assets for households to use, it would likely
have an expansionary impact in spite of raising tax revenue that is not captured in standard estimates of the structural
balance.

economy though the composition of the adjustment measures. Staff estimates of fiscal multipliers
using IMF’s Global Integrated Monetary and Fiscal (GIMF) model provide further estimations broadly
support this view (Selected Issues, Chapter 3).
Authorities’ views
14.
The authorities largely agreed on the assessment of the policy stance, although with
some differences among institutions. On monetary policy, the authorities view their experience
with negative interest rates positively. While international reserves are higher than before the crisis,
the experience of the last several years suggests a higher threshold for reserve adequacy than the
actual pre-crisis level of reserves. They did not see deflation as an immediate concern, and noted that
monetary policy would continue to be based on the exchange rate peg rather than inflation. The
authorities also stressed their commitment to adhere to the guidelines of the Stability and Growth
Pact, noting the importance of maintaining Denmark’s credibility. However, they noted that further
tightening should be considered carefully in light of the fragile recovery. While fiscal policy is broadly
appropriate, in 2015 it would be consistent with the closing output gap to have a margin to the limits
for budget deficits. They noted that there will be a need to gradually normalize the current
supportive fiscal stance over the coming years as the economic recovery gains momentum. The fiscal
authorities did not see a need for a tightening of the planned fiscal stance in 2015.

B. Financial Sector Policy
15.
The large size of the financial sector and the constraints on the exchange rate peg,
make financial sector structural policy particularly important. The financial sector is large with
assets over 650 percent of GDP. Financial sector stability issues also need to be addressed by
macroprudential and other structural policies, given that the constraints of an exchange rate peg and
fully-open capital account that largely determine monetary policy.
16.
The recent FSAP mission concluded that financial stability risks in Denmark are
contained. The authorities have taken steps to enhance financial system resilience since the global
financial crisis, including: (i) a new bank resolution framework that entails bail-in of creditors which
was used to resolve small and medium-sized banks; (ii) a new institutional framework for macroprudential policy; (iii) implementation of regulations on domestic systemically important financial
institutions; and (iv) recent legislation requiring maturity extension of covered bonds in stress
situations with the aim of reducing refinancing risk in the

Box 3. Negative Interest Rates
The objective of Denmark’s monetary policy is to ensure price stability through a peg to the
euro. Interest rate policy is thus guided solely by the need to maintain the peg. Formally, the
Danish krone is kept within a band of 2.25 percent in each direction, but the actual band is much

smaller in practice.
7.9

The Danmarks Nationalbank’s reaction function is
well-known to market participants. The bank’s first
response to pressure on the rate in either direction is
to intervene in the foreign exchange market. If
intervention is not sufficient to stabilize the rate,
policy interest rates will be adjusted. Given the peg,
Danmarks Nationalbank policy rates are usually close
to ECB rates although generally not identical.

mortgage finance system. The impact of all of these measures will have to be assessed over the
coming years given that all are quite new.
17.
More recently, the authorities have proposed supervisory guidelines for mortgage
credit institutions to prevent a recurrence of the loose credit standards in the boom. The
“supervisory diamond” for mortgage credit institutions proposes to address risks by monitoring five
risk indicators: (i) growth in lending; (ii) borrower’s interest-rate risk; (iii) deferred amortization loans
with high loan-to-value (LTV) ratios; (iv) high-LTV loans with short-term funding; and (v) large
exposures. Two additional proposals require that (i) home buyers will have to make a down payment
of at least 5 percent when purchasing a home including first mortgage (capped at 80 percent of
home value) and other borrowing collateralized by the real estate; and (ii) commercial properties
must be able to generate a positive cash flow before they can be financed. The proposed supervisory
diamond for mortgage credit institutions is planned to be finalized by January 2015 and phased-in
by 2018 or 2020, for the various indicators. The parameters are largely calibrated to reflect the
current practice to contain the impact on the economy of any future incipient loosening of lending
standards.
18.
Important policy actions have helped to safeguard financial stability but the large size
and high domestic interconnectedness of the financial system require even greater resilience.
Staff recommended further measures to reduce risks:


Mortgage banks and covered bonds market. To mitigate risks introduced by recent product
innovation, use regulatory policies to encourage longer bond maturities, ensure that interest-rate risk
is better reflected in loan pricing and approvals, and increase buffers in loans with interest-only
periods, for example, by reducing the loan-to-value ceiling. The proposal for a supervisory diamond
for mortgage credit institutions goes in the right direction.



Macroprudential policy. Explore new instruments capable of addressing time-varying systemic risk,
such as limits on LTV and debt service to income ratios. Review the experience with institutional
arrangements, especially the appointment of the government as the designated macro-prudential
authority. The proposed requirement that home buyers make a down payment of at least 5 percent
is welcome.



Prudential supervision. Reduce the length of examination cycles for banks and insurance companies
through the use of additional resources, and ensure the operational independence of the Danish
Financial Supervisory Authority (DFSA).



Crisis management and bank resolution. Continue to implement early resolution triggers and
strengthen funding arrangements as well as the resolution toolkit, prepare resolution plans and
resolvability assessments, and enhance the deposit guarantee scheme. Formalize the framework for
emergency liquidity support.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

DENMARK

Authorities’ views
19.
The authorities broadly agreed with staff’s conclusions. The DFSA is developing guidance
(a supervisory diamond) to address the enhansed risks in the mortgage finance system. On
macroprudential policy, the authorities pointed to recent initiatives on a down payment of five
percent in relation to housing finance and a requirement of positive cash flow in relation to financing
commercial properties. The purpose of these proposals is to prevent a weakening of lending
standards. The forthcoming transposition of the EU Banking Recovery and Resolution Directive into
national law would largely address staff’s recommendations on the bank resolution framework.
Staff’s recommendations on prudential supervision would be brought to the DFSA Board in the near
future. Furthermore, the authorities welcomed the final LCR requirements recently approved by the
European Commission. On the Banking Union, no decision has been taken on Danish participation as
a non-euro Member State.

C. House Prices and Household Debt
20.
High household debt is an underlying vulnerability and house price volatility has
consequences for the real economy. While household debt has not posed a direct risk to financial
stability so far, it leaves households more exposed to income, interest, and asset price shocks with
implications for both the real economy and the financial sectors. In the face of shocks, high
household debt and the low level of liquid financial assets are likely to induce households to cut
consumption, which will undermine macro stability, with adverse consequences for retail trade and
construction, and the lenders to those sectors (Box 4).
21.
Staff recommended a multi-pronged approach to containing risks and limiting the
build-up of further household debt. Various features of tax, rental market, and financial sector
policy need to be reconsidered in order to limit house price volatility and to prevent excessive debt
accumulation in the future. The freeze on real estate valuations for tax purposes at 2002 levels leads
to a pro-cyclical impulse. This valuation freeze creates a bias in the tax system towards owneroccupied dwellings relative to other investment. A bias will also arise as interest rates normalize.
Tight rent control also contributes to increased price volatility in owner-occupied dwellings, and may
push households with limited financial buffers into premature home ownership. Finally, deferred
amortization loans limit the build-up of home equity and increase the exposure of households to
shocks. The latter is also the case for adjustable rate loans. The proposals for a mortgage credit
institution supervisory diamond and 5 percent down payment requirement should be complemented
by reduced tax preferences for housing and less rigid rental market regulations.
Authorities’ views
22.
The authorities noted that structural factors such as the highly developed mortgage
financing system and high pension assets are behind the high levels of household debt. A
series of studies conducted by Danmarks Nationalbank using household level micro data have shown
that debt is more concentrated in families with high income. Stress tests have also shown that most
households are resilient to interest rate shocks and the number of families in arrears remains

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

DENMARK

relatively low even in stress scenarios. While the authorities viewed that the direct impact from
household debt on financial stability is limited, they acknowledged that the size of household
balance sheet could imply some risks to macro stability with a possible indirect effect on the financial
system in the case of severe adverse shocks to the Danish economy. They emphasized the
importance of a stable housing market in this respect. The authorities noted that the gradual
reduction of the mortgage interest rate deduction goes in the direction of reducing the procyclicality
of the housing market. Danmarks Nationalbank acknowledged that the tax freeze on real estate
leads to procyclical effects, and noted that, to curb fluctuations in house prices, housing taxes should
be changed so they automatically reflect property and land values.

D. Productivity and Labor Market reform
23.
Productivity in Denmark has grown only modestly in the past decade. Productivity
growth is lagging behind the Danish historical average as well as that of peer countries. This
contributed to rising unit labor costs and lowered competitiveness. The government appointed a
Productivity Commission in 2012 which released its final report in early 2014. The Commission made
more than one hundred specific recommendations in three main areas: (i) strengthening competition,
(ii) improving the quality of education, and (iii) enhancing the efficiency of the public sector. Many of
the recommendations seem appropriate (e.g., increase taxation of property and lower marginal tax
rates on earned income for high earners and corporate taxes) and some are in line with past Fund
advice (relax restrictions on large retail stores and remove ownership restrictions on businesses such
as pharmacies). However, others are outside the Fund’s core areas (e.g., reform of higher education)
or are stated in very general terms (evaluating the stock of regulations to see which are still relevant).
24.
The authorities plan to adopt some of the recommendations of the Commission. Many
of the recommendations of the Commission are in areas where the government has been making
gradual reforms over time. For example, the government had already implemented a tax reform plan
that will reduce the rate of corporate income tax from 25 percent in 2013 to 22 percent in 2016.
Further reforms were included in the Growth Plan 2014 as a first response to the recommendations.5
However, some of the suggested reforms have been rejected such as relaxing the restrictions on
large retail establishments.
25.
Labor market challenges persist but a number of actions have been put in place to
address them. The government reformed the early retirement scheme in 2011, increased the
statutory retirement rate from 65 to 67 over the period 2019-22, and indexed the retirement age to
life expectancy from 2025. The maximum period of unemployment insurance benefits has also been
shortened from 4 to 2 years. Most recently, the eligibility criteria for disability pensions as well as

social assistance have been tightened and the period for sickness benefits shortened. In addition to
sharing the common theme of restricting eligibility or the length of benefits, these reforms also focus
on using the resources saved to provide greater support services for beneficiaries (Annex I).
Authorities’ views
26.
The authorities agreed on the need to improve productivity. They stressed that many of
the recommendations by the Productivity Commission are in areas where the government has been
making progress over the years. In addition, the Growth Plan 2014 is an initial response of the
government to the recommendations of the Productivity Commission and includes a number of
specific reforms targeted at boosting productivity. They also pointed to the encouraging evidence
that recent reforms to unemployment, sickness, and disability benefits were having the desired
effects in terms of increased labor force participation.

interest rates and facilitated trade with the neighboring euro-area countries.
28.
The government’s fiscal policy for 2015 and the medium term is broadly appropriate
and should meet the headline deficit targets. On current budget plans, the headline deficit should
meet the target, although it is difficult to assess the structural balance. In any event, Denmark’s low
net and gross debt levels and strong track record support the positive market perception of its fiscal
strength.
29.
Stress tests conducted as part of the FSAP update found that financial stability risks are
contained but further measures to reduce risks would be helpful. The authorities have taken
steps to enhance financial system resilience since the global financial crisis. However, additional
measures in the areas of: (i) mortgage banks and the covered bond market; (ii) macroprudential
policy; (iii) prudential supervision; and (iv) crisis management and bank resolution would reduce risks
further. Specifically, developing the loan-to-value and debt service-to-income ratios as
macroprudential tools, lengthening covered bond maturities, reducing the length of examination
cycles, and strengthening the toolkit and funding arrangements for bank resolution would all be
welcome.
30.
High household debt is an underlying vulnerability and house price volatility has
consequences for the real economy. Some features of tax, rental market, and financial sector policy
should be reconsidered in order to limit house price volatility and to prevent excessive debt
accumulation in the future. The proposals for a mortgage credit institution supervisory diamond and
5 percent down payment requirement should be complemented by reduced tax preferences for
housing and less rigid rental market regulations.
31.
Productivity in Denmark has grown only modestly in the past decade. The Productivity
Commission has released its recommendations, many of which are in areas where the government

DENMARK

has been making gradual reforms over time. Further reforms were included in the Growth Plan 2014
as a first response to the recommendations but all of the remaining recommendations by the
Commission deserve further consideration.
32.
Labor market challenges persist but recent actions to address them are welcome.
Increasing labor market participation is a high priority given the fiscal burden of an aging population.
Building on previous measures to increase the retirement age, reforms to disability, sickness, and
unemployment benefits as well as other active labor market policies and social assistance have been
put in place. These share the common theme of restricting eligibility or the length of benefits and
using the resources saved to provide greater support services for beneficiaries.
33.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Denmark be held on the
standard 12-month cycle.

Authorities’ Response to Past IMF Policy Recommendations
Fund Policy Advice from 2012 Consultation

Authorities’ Actions

Fiscal Policy: The Executive Board supported
Denmark’s medium term fiscal consolidation
plans and agreed that, if growth falls
significantly below current projections, the
authorities should allow automatic stabilizers
to operate fully and consider additional
support to the economy within the space
permitted by EU commitments. The Board
underscored the importance of meeting the
2013 targets under the EU Excessive Deficit
Procedure and exiting from it in early 2014 for
maintaining market confidence.
Financial Sector: The Board welcomed the
authorities’ initiatives on macro-prudential
and crisis resolution policies, including the
creation of the interagency Systemic Risk
Council. The Board stressed that there is scope
for additional strengthening of the financial
sector through more robust capital and
liquidity buffers, risk-based deposit insurance
premia, limits on deferred amortization
mortgage loans, and a reversal of the
decoupling of taxes from real estate values to
limit excess volatility in housing markets.
Competitiveness and Productivity Growth:
Directors agreed that additional reforms to
raise potential growth would include further
measures to boost competition and limit tax
disincentives to work and to the accumulation
of human capital. In this context, Directors
looked forward to the findings of the
Productivity Commission on productivity
enhancements, including in the public sector

The deficit peaked at 3.9 percent of GDP in
2012 but was contained to 0.9 percent of
GDP in 2013. Consequently, Denmark met the
requirements for exiting the Excessive Deficit
Procedure (EDP) also with a consolidation of
the structural deficit by 1.5 percent from 2010
to 2013.

The authorities are strengthening capital and
liquidity buffers with the implementation of
the Basel III/CRDIV requirements.
More recently, the authorities have proposed
supervisory guidelines for mortgage credit
institutions to prevent a recurrence of the
loose credit standards in the boom, including
a limit on deferred amortization loans with
high loan-to-value ratios..

The Productivity Commission released its final
report in early 2014 with more than one
hundred specific recommendations.
Many of the recommendations of the
Commission are in areas where the
government has been making gradual
reforms over time. Further reforms were
included in the Growth Plan 2014 as a first
response to the recommendations

Annex I. Recent Labor Market Reforms
Unemployment benefits: In July 2010, a reform of the benefit scheme reduced the maximum
unemployment benefit period from four years within the last six years to two years within the last three
years (however, a lower benefit for a subsequent two years is possible). In addition, effective July 2012,
entry criteria were tightened from 26 weeks of employment to re-qualify for unemployment benefits to 52
weeks.
Disability pension: In January 2013, the criteria for receiving a disability pension were tightened but
options and support for rehabilitation were added. In particular, disability pension is discontinued for
persons under the age of 40 (with very few exceptions), and access to disability pension in general
requires prior participation in at least one rehabilitation program. Instead of a disability pension, persons
with substantially reduced work capacity will be offered individually-tailored rehabilitation and support
measures for up to 5 years. In addition, the new flex-job scheme (the special employment program for
persons with disabilities) allows for part-time work at the normal wage (paid by the employer) plus
unemployment benefit-level pay for the rest of the working week. The reform has so far been successful in
cutting new entries to disability pensions in half.
Social assistance: A reform of social assistance was implemented in January 2014 that establishes a
requirement for education for people below the age of 30 who do not have training or education but
have sufficient basic skills. Social assistance for this group is also lowered to the same level as education
support. Those who have received training/education will be required to get a job. More vulnerable
groups (e.g., people with a range of challenges, single parents) will receive additional assistance in the
form of mentoring and a coordinating caseworker. Since being implemented, the reform has helped
reduce the number of young social assistance recipients below 30, with about half of the reduction
resulting from entering into education and about half from employment.
Sickness benefits: In July 2014, a reform of the sickness benefit scheme reduced the maximum sickness
benefit period from 12 to 5 months (with various exemptions), but provides for additional support
including potential access to a rehabilitation scheme (for up to several years), at a lower level of assistance
than the sickness benefits.
Active labor market policy (ALMP): A reform of ALMP is expected in early 2015, with emphasis on new,
individual and job-focused effort for the unemployed, targeted training and education with enhanced
focus on the demand of companies, and improved cooperation between job centers and companies. In
addition, a new funding system, expected to be in place early 2016, aims to give the municipalities greater
incentives to help the unemployed find jobs. In particular, municipalities pay for unemployment benefits,
with state co-financing decreasing with longer unemployment duration.
International recruitment: A reform of international recruitment, which takes effect early 2015, is
expected to facilitate Danish enterprises’ access to highly qualified labor. The key initiatives include a
scheme that allows foreign employees in certified enterprises to start work before formal approval of
residence and work permits, and easier access for foreign graduates with a Danish MA or PhD.

Exchange Arrangements: Denmark participates in the European Exchange Rate mechanism II
(ERMII) with a central rate at DKr 746.038 per €100. The standard width of the fluctuation band in
ERM II is +/-15 percent. However, due to its high degree of convergence, Denmark has entered into
an agreement with the European Central Bank (ECB) and the euro area member states on a narrower
fluctuation band of +/- 2.25 percent. This means that the krone can only fluctuate between DKr
762.824 per 100 euro and DKr 729.252 per €100.
Denmark has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2(a), 3 and 4, and maintains an
exchange system free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions,
apart from those imposed solely for the preservation of national or international security, as notified
to the Fund by the National Bank of Denmark in accordance with Executive Board Decision No. 144(52/51).
Article IV Consultation: The last Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on
January 16, 2013. The staff report (IMF Country Report No. 13/22) was published with Public
Information Notice (PIN) No. 13/08 (January 24, 2013)..
Outreach: The team met with representatives of the private sector, labor and financial institutions.
Press conference: The mission held a press conference after the concluding meeting on September
26, 2014
Publication: The staff report will be published.
Technical Assistance: None.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Data provision is adequate for surveillance. The country has a full range of statistical publications,
many of which are on the Internet. The quality and timeliness of the economic database are generally
very good. The country subscribes to the Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard. Metadata are
posted on the Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board.
National Accounts: Denmark adopted the European System of Accounts 2010 (ESA 2010) in
September 2014. The transition from the ESA 1995 (ESA95) requires a revision of national accounts
data. New data sources are also incorporated in the new estimates which were published in midSeptember 2014. Historical data are revised going back to 1966.
Government Finance Statistics: Starting from September 2014, government finance statistics data
is based on the ESA 2010 methodology which includes revisions of the general government deficit
and debt levels from 1995 onwards. Revised data series was published in October 2014.
External Statistics: Starting in 2014, external sector statistics are compiled according to the Balance
of Payments and International Investment Position Manual, sixth edition (BPM6) and in accordance
with legal requirements of the ECB and Eurostat.
Monetary and Financial Statistics: Monetary data reported for International Financial Statistics are
based on the European Central Bank’s (ECB) framework for collecting, compiling, and reporting
monetary data.

IMF Executive Board Concludes Article IV Consultation with Denmark
On December 5, 2014 the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Denmark.1
The Danish economy is recovering slowly and unevenly. The economy contracted slightly (by
0.1 percent) in 2013, but it looks likely to accelerate modestly in 2014. Growth is held down by a
trend decline in North Sea oil and gas production as well as exports to euro-area partners. At the
same time, private domestic demand and non-oil exports are supporting growth. Employment has
increased and unemployment has been trending downward slightly over the past year. Inflation
and interest rates remain low. Domestic inflation is about 1.5 percent although lower inflation in
imports holds down the broader indices. Wage growth is also moderate. Deposit and lending
rates remain very low, while government bond rates are negative out to two year maturities.
Fiscal policy turned slightly supportive in 2014 after a substantial consolidation in 2013. While
the 2013 consolidation was sufficient to exit from the Excessive Deficit Procedure, the headline
deficit is expected to expand in 2014 and is projected to widen further in 2015.
Financial system profitability is still low, in line with weak credit growth, but capitalization has
improved. For commercial banks as a whole, already-high capital ratios have risen further and
liquid assets as a share of total assets have also increased. At mortgage credit institutions, capital
ratios are also high. However, weaknesses in some non-systemic banks warrant close monitoring
and may require intervention.
The recovery is likely to continue but remain fragile. Annual growth is estimated at 0.7 percent
in 2014, projected to increase to 1.4 percent in 2015, and trend to slightly above 2 percent
thereafter. Domestic demand and exports to non euro-area countries should support the recovery.
As the recovery continues at a modest pace, the output gap is expected to largely close by 2018.

Under Article IV of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country’s economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

2
However, risks remain on the downside. Surges in global financial markets volatility (disorderly
exit from unconventional monetary policy or other causes) that lead to a spike in market interest
rates could depress consumption as households’ cash flow is diverted to higher debt service on
adjustable rate mortgages. A protracted period of low euro area interest rates as the Danish
economy recovers could create overheating pressures and overvalued asset prices. A drop in
confidence in Danish covered bonds could depress consumption through higher debt service on
adjustable rate mortgages. Last but not least, the Nordic-Baltic financial system is tightly
integrated and problems elsewhere in the region would spill over into Denmark and outward
spillovers from Denmark would most likely propagate through the financial system channel.
Executive Board Assessment2
The Executive Directors welcomed the rebound in economic activity, the steady decline in
unemployment, and the improved housing market. Directors agreed that growth prospects are
favorable, underpinned by the strong track record of prudent macroeconomic policies and
financial system stability, while the exchange rate peg continues to serve the economy well.
Meanwhile, vulnerabilities remain from the elevated household debt and weak growth in
Denmark’s main trading partners.
Directors commended the authorities for their substantial fiscal consolidation efforts in recent
years, which have kept the debt-to-GDP ratio at low levels and strengthened public finances.
They agreed that the fiscal stance for 2015 is broadly appropriate, consistent with the mediumterm goal of achieving a structural budgetary balance. Directors supported the authorities’
intention to start rebuilding fiscal buffers, taking due account of cyclical developments.
Directors noted that, while financial stability risks are generally contained, further efforts are
needed to enhance the resilience of the financial system, in view of its large size and risks in
mortgage finance. Priorities include developing macroprudential tools; strengthening prudential
supervision and regulatory requirements for mortgage banks; and improving crisis management
and bank resolution. Directors looked forward to continued close regional cooperation and full
implementation of the recommendations of the updated Financial System Stability Assessment.
Directors emphasized the need to prevent excessive accumulation of household debt. They
agreed that the new supervisory guidelines for mortgage credit institutions, the down payment
requirement, and the gradual reduction in mortgage interest deductibility would go a long way in

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as a Chairman of the Board,
summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country’s
authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:

reducing risks and house price volatility. Directors noted that these initiatives could be
complemented by measures to rebalance tax incentives and deregulate the rental market.
Directors encouraged the authorities to pursue additional reforms to enhance productivity growth
and competitiveness. In this regard, they considered that many recommendations from the recent
Productivity Commission warrant further consideration. Directors also called for continued
efforts to increase labor market participation and improve the functioning of the labor market
more broadly.

Statement by Audun Groenn, Executive Director for Denmark and
Anne Marcussen, Advisor to Executive Director for Denmark
December 5, 2014
On behalf of our Danish authorities, we would like to thank staff for candid and
constructive policy discussions in Copenhagen during the Article IV and FSAP missions.
Our authorities appreciate the high quality papers addressing topical issues for the
Danish economy. They broadly concur with staff's analysis and assessment and will
carefully consider the recommendations.
Economic outlook
The recovery of the Danish economy is progressing, although at a moderate pace, and
growth has been somewhat slower than previously expected. The improvement is most
evident in private sector employment, which has increased by 1.5 percent since mid2013. This reflects the fact that production in the private sector has risen by more than is
shown by GDP. In the first three quarters of 2014, GDP has been 0.7 percent higher than
in the same period the previous year, whereas growth in the gross value added in the
private sector, excluding mining and quarrying, has been 1.1 percent.
The subdued growth in the Danish economy in recent years must be seen in connection
with weaker-than-expected growth in the euro area. Furthermore, growth in consumer
spending has been subdued, despite an increase in consumer confidence. However, the
sluggishness of private consumption also reflects unusually low expenditures on energy
consumption in 2014. Normalization thereof may lead to a higher contribution from
consumption in 2015. Going forward, consumption is expected to grow in line with
income.
According to the outlook, growth in the Danish economy will continue and pick up in the
coming years. It is expected that exports, including to the euro area, can be an important
driver for the Danish economy, and going forward domestic demand will contribute more
to growth. Growth is expected to mainly take place in the private sector. Along with the
outlook for gradually strengthening growth, the decline in layoffs and the increasing
number of available jobs provide a basis for employment growth to continue.
The preconditions for a pick-up in growth are present. The adjustment of the Danish
economy has come very far after overheating in the 2000s and the global downturn in
2008-09. Competitiveness has been strengthened considerably in recent years, progress in
the housing market is becoming more broad-based, and households have consolidated
their finances. This provides a stronger basis for growth for the Danish economy to
continue and accelerate in the coming years. Furthermore, the Government has
implemented a series of reforms and growth initiatives that will support opportunities for

2
growth. Growth is also supported by the low interest rates that reflect a very
accommodative monetary policy while fiscal policy remains supportive.
Concerning risks to the outlook, the Danish economy is closely connected to the
international economy, and especially that of the euro area. Should the international
economy grow by less than expected, it will dampen growth in the Danish economy. In
addition to the direct impact, through lower demand for exports, it may also impact the
economy through adverse effects on consumer and business confidence.
Fiscal policy
On fiscal policy, the Danish authorities note staff’s view that the 2015 fiscal stance seems
appropriate following the additional policy measures announced in October. These
measures do not affect the structural balance or the fiscal impulse, but are aimed at
creating a safety margin relative to the 3 percent deficit limit in the EU’s Stability and
Growth Pact. This is achieved through an intertemporal shifting of revenues related to the
large amount of tax-liable pension savings in Denmark.
Staff characterizes the fiscal impulse in 2015 as slightly contractionary. Subsequent data
suggest however, that spending will come in lower than expected in 2014, which implies
that planned spending in 2015 will now be compared to a lower base. Factoring in also
some reprioritization in the 2015 budget accord, the fiscal stance for 2015 may now be
better characterized as roughly neutral.
Fiscal policy should not just be viewed in year-to-year changes but also in terms of
levels. In level terms, the fiscal stance for 2015 is supportive, i.e. the structural balance is
below its sustainable medium-term level. In addition, automatic stabilizers are high in
Denmark, and the deficit is close to 3 percent excluding one-off measures. Hence, in
level terms, fiscal policy is still providing support to the economy.
Going forward, there will be a need to start rebuilding fiscal buffers over the medium
term. The pace should be timed in relation to cyclical developments. Fiscal policy in
Denmark has long been planned within a medium-term framework and with a view to
addressing longer-term challenges from population ageing and declining oil and gas
revenues. With the major reforms of pensions and other spending, fiscal policy is now
assessed by the government, as well as by independent institutions, to be sustainable over
the long term.
Since the onset of the global financial crisis, Danish economic policy has responded with
reforms of pensions, taxes, unemployment and cash benefits, disability benefits and
more. In sum, the reforms since 2009 are estimated to raise potential output in the
medium term by up to 5 percent by 2020. This reform drive has been complemented with
measures to improve expenditure control, which had long been the Achilles Heel of fiscal

3
policy before the adoption of the “Budget Law.” Since 2011, there has no longer been
any expenditure slippage. Expenditure control is now backed by rolling 4-year
expenditure ceilings which cover the bulk of government spending (except public
investment, interest payments and unemployment-related expenditure).
In the medium term, the structural deficit will gradually be reduced towards the mediumterm structural balance target in 2020. Staff rightly notes that there are differing estimates
of the current level of potential output, and hence of the structural balance. The
government is strongly committed to achieve the aim of structural balance in 2020, which
on current assessments is consistent with long-term sustainable policies.
Monetary and exchange rate policy
The Danish authorities welcome the assessment that the fixed exchange rate policy
continues to serve Denmark well. This has also been the case in periods when the interest
rate on certificates of deposits has been negative, which did not impose significant
burdens on the financial sector or on non-financial firms and households.
The peg to the euro helps anchor inflation expectations and it is a cornerstone of the
stability-oriented economic policy. In this respect, it is important to note that inflation has
been close to the rate of inflation in the euro area for many years. At the same time,
external competitiveness has improved, the current account surplus is relatively high and
unemployment is relatively low, despite a sharp fall in domestic and external demand. As
pointed out by IMF staff, the peg also helps facilitate trade with neighboring euro area
countries. These benefits clearly outweigh the theoretical drawback that interest rates do
not correspond fully to cyclical conditions in Denmark.
House prices and household debt
The Danish authorities share the view that household indebtedness does not pose a direct
threat to financial stability. Debt is concentrated among households with high incomes
and stress tests have shown that most households are resilient to interest rate shocks and
that the number of families in arrears remains relatively low even in stress scenarios.
However, the authorities acknowledge that the size of household balance sheets may
imply some risks to macroeconomic stability if interest rates should rise markedly, with
potential spillovers to the financial sector.
The mortgage credit system is the primary source of financing for house purchases in
Denmark. As pointed out by IMF staff, the system is highly developed and the average
price of mortgage loans is among the lowest in Europe. Moreover, the system has proven
resilient even in periods with substantial financial stress. In conjunction with the
widespread use of occupational pension schemes, this is a key factor behind the high

4
levels of household debt. The well-functioning mortgage system and the widespread use
of occupational pension schemes in themselves provide substantial benefits for Danish
households.
The authorities acknowledge that flexible rate mortgages and mortgages with deferred
amortization have introduced additional risks into the system, but it is also important to
note (as pointed out by IMF staff) that variable rate mortgages have played an important
counter-cyclical role during and after the financial crisis. The additional risks are, to a
large extent, being addressed by the new supervisory framework (“supervisory
diamond”) for mortgage banks and by the additional measures discussed in the section on
financial sector policies. Innovations in the mortgage market have given households
additional flexibility to manage their finances. This should be taken duly into account
when considering further initiatives addressing risks in the mortgage market.
While some further steps could be taken in order to reduce risks in the mortgage market
by e.g. reducing LTV ratios for deferred-amortization mortgages, the authorities do not
see a case for introducing legislation directly targeted at achieving a general reduction in
mortgage debt. If credit to households were to expand rapidly relative to income in a
future upturn, that would call for increased attention. The authorities are currently
looking into options for improving data collection with a view to, inter alia, better
identify and monitor systemic risks. Large household balance sheets reinforce the need
for policies aimed at ensuring macroeconomic stability. A stable housing market is key in
this respect. The gradual reduction in mortgage interest deductibility goes some way in
the direction of reducing the pro-cyclicality of the housing market.
The authorities acknowledge that the structure of the rental market may affect the
demand for housing and mortgage debt. However, distortions in the rental market should
be seen in a broader context, as the rental market performs a social role in providing
affordable housing for low-income families. Any changes to the regulations of the rental
market should also be seen in conjunction with the treatment of owner-occupied housing.
Productivity and labor market reforms
The Danish authorities welcome the assessment on productivity and labor market
reforms, as well as the acknowledgement of recent actions addressing labor market
challenges. The Danish Government’s persistent reform efforts have improved the
growth potential of the Danish economy. The Government has a target to increase
structural GDP by DKK 20 billion by 2020 through improved conditions for private
companies and another DKK 20 billion through increased employment and increased
educational attainment in the working age population.

5
The 2013 and 2014 growth packages will contribute to raising GDP by DKK 11.5 billion
by 2020 through improved conditions for private companies. The agreements contain a
great number of specific initiatives to make it easier and less expensive for companies to
operate by e.g. reducing administrative burdens, enhancing the efficiency of the utility
sectors, removing ownership barriers in order to enhance competition, reducing the
corporate tax, and a number of targeted taxes, including cuts in energy taxes. At the same
time, a number of labor market reforms have been adopted, which will contribute to
boosting employment through increased labor supply and, consequently, increase GDP
by another DKK 19.5 billion by 2020. In other words, important steps have been taken
towards the fulfillment of the 2020 growth targets presented in Growth Plan DK.
Staff recommends a continued consideration of reforms to improve productivity,
including all of the remaining recommendations by the Productivity Commission.
Productivity growth is the primary driver for sustained growth in the economy. Denmark
faces the challenge that real GDP growth has been low since 1995 due to relatively low
productivity growth. However, Denmark has remained among the wealthiest countries in
the world through that period as a result of gains in terms of trade and increased foreign
income. Further reforms and initiatives will be needed in order to achieve the remaining
DKK 8.5 billion through improved conditions for private companies. The work towards
achieving the Government’s growth target will continue.
The Danish Government has decided to strengthen impact assessments of new legislation
and reduce the burdens of government regulation by another DKK 2 billion by 2020, and
has established a committee to review the rules for the taxation of businesses at the
company and owner level and a committee to review energy subsidies and taxes.
It is worth noting that wage competitiveness has improved significantly since 2008. The
recovery of wage competitiveness has improved the conditions for manufacturing jobs in
the future. The trend in advanced production and automation provides a further potential
for manufacturing in Denmark, because factors other than wages will become
increasingly significant.
Financial sector policies
The Danish authorities welcome the assessment of the regulation and supervision of the
Danish banking and insurance sectors, and generally share the views expressed in the
assessment reports as well as the grading of most of the Basel Core Principles and
Insurance Core Principles. Observations and recommendations in the assessment reports
will be used to further improve work on regulation and supervision in Denmark.
The authorities also welcome the work on stress testing the large financial companies in
Denmark. On the banking side, the recent European stress test and asset quality review

6
confirms the robustness of the largest Danish banks that together account for the main
part of the banking sector. On the insurance side, the authorities have commented that the
assumptions in the stress tests are restrictive, which have large negative effects on
solvency positions in the scenarios. This is also reflected by the IMF in the reports. The
Danish FSA has concluded a robustness analysis in the beginning of November. The
analysis shows that the sector in general is financially prepared for the transition to
Solvency II under the current market conditions.
The Danish authorities appreciate the analysis of the challenges arising from the growth
in adjustable rate mortgage loans and mortgages with a temporary interest only feature.
On 2 December 2014 the Danish FSA published the final version of the supervisory
diamond for mortgage-credit institutions. The supervisory diamond contains five
indicators with corresponding limits on the risk of the institutions. Amongst the
indicators are the proportion of loans without amortisation (interest-only) and the
proportion of loans with frequent refinancing. The supervisory diamond will take effect
in two steps in 2018 and 2020, and will constitute a significant step in creating a more
robust mortgage system safeguarding financial stability.
On macroprudential policies, the authorities agree with staff that the arrangements on the
Systemic Risk Council’s (SRC) transparency and accountability are sound. A review of
the SRC is planned for 2016. The authorities take note of staff's recommendation to
review the institutional arrangements more broadly, including the appointment of the
government as the designated authority. Staff recommends a further development of the
macroprudential policy framework, for instance to develop LTV limits. In September, the
Danish FSA and Minister of Business and Growth put forward an initiative requiring a
down payment of five percent when financing house purchases. Staff also recommends
developing limits on the DSTI ratio. The government has no plans to introduce such a
measure. The legal basis for imposing sectoral capital requirements is already in place
through the implementation of the European Capital Requirements Directive and
regulation.
On crisis management and bank resolution, the authorities also generally welcome staff’s
recommendations which largely correspond to the authorities’ priorities. The authorities’
main focus in this regard is the full implementation of the BRRD in national law which is
expected to be completed in the first half of 2015.
