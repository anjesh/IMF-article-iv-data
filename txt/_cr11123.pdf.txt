

Mission. A staff team consisting of R. Guimarães (chief), Eteri Kvintradze, and Ding
Ding (all APD) visited Thimphu from March 18 to 29, 2011. Mr. Choudhary (OED)
joined the mission.



Outlook and risks. Bhutan’s growth outlook is favorable, underpinned by hydropower
and services sectors. Growth in India should continue to boost hydropower exports. Risks
are broadly balanced and stem mainly from growth in India and lower than envisaged aid
flows.



Main policy issues. A recalibration of policy settings is required to address the following
challenges: (i) the risk of overheating; (ii) debt sustainability; (iii) weak management of
public finances and monetary operations; and (iv) rapid credit growth. Implementing
structural reforms that will boost private sector participation will also be important for
longer-term growth and job creation.



Past advice. In previous consultations, the authorities and staff shared the view that
meeting fiscal objectives was important to safeguard the credibility of the peg. They also
concurred that containing credit growth is instrumental in preventing overheating and
balance payment pressures. The authorities have implemented some of the staff’s
recommendations, including increasing competition in the banking sector and
streamlining tax rates.



Exchange rate regime. The de facto (and de jure) exchange rate regime is a
conventional peg to the Indian rupee. Bhutan continues to avail itself of transitional
arrangements under Article XIV, Section 2 and maintains restrictions under it. Bhutan
also maintains an exchange restriction subject to Fund approval under Article VIII,
Section 2(a).

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Context: Bhutan’s rapid growth has been underpinned by hydropower sector development with
donor support, and its strong ties with India. Since 2008/09, however, the fiscal position has
deteriorated because of higher spending and sluggish revenue, and inflation has risen. The mediumterm outlook remains favorable provided the near-term challenges are addressed and structural
reforms implemented.
Policy messages:


Tighten fiscal policy in the near term by controlling current spending. The current
balance should remain in surplus to limit domestic financing, which will shore up
macroeconomic stability.



Broaden the revenue base and improve public financial management by adopting a multiyear rolling budget to help ensure debt sustainability.



Improve monetary operations and liquidity management. The policy rate should be better
aligned with India’s money market rates to ensure the sustainability of the exchange rate
peg. A more active management of convertible currencies reserves would help address
rupee shortages.



Strengthen regulatory and supervision capacity of the Royal Monetary Authority (RMA)
to safeguard financial stability in an environment of rapid credit growth.



Advance the implementation of structural reforms to facilitate private sector investment
and boost competitiveness, as envisaged in the authorities’ new Economic Development
Policy (EDP).

I. CONTEXT
1.
Following its transition into a parliamentary democracy in 2008, Bhutan has
enjoyed political stability. Local elections were held in January 2011 and the process of
transition to a full participatory democracy has proceeded steadily. The government has
implemented its economic policies to improve Gross National Happiness (GNH) and ensure
sustainable development. The 10th five-year plan (FYP) encompasses ambitious socio-economic
goals.
2.
Bhutan’s economic performance in recent years has been strong, driven by

Bhutan’s progress on social indicators has been steady. Primary school enrollment
ratio has risen significantly over the fifteen years. Gender equality has also improved, as have
health indicators such as infant mortality, which has been nearly halved since 1995. Progress has
also been made on poverty reduction. Overall, Bhutan is on track or has achieved most of the
Millennium Development Goals.
II. MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND RISKS
Recent Developments
4.
Growth has been strong, but inflation
has risen. GDP growth accelerated to an
estimated 7.5 percent in 2009/10, underpinned
by services, construction, and the hydropower
sector. However, inflation rose sharply, doubling
to 9 percent at end-2010 from the year before.
While initially food prices were the main culprit,
price pressures have become generalized, as in
India.

5.
The external position has deteriorated, but remains manageable. The current account
deficit has increased to about 13 percent of GDP due to strong imports related to the construction
of hydropower plants, but the overall balance of payments has remained in surplus due to sizable
grants and loans disbursements. The reserve position has remained comfortable. Despite some
recent appreciation, the real effective exchange rate has been stable and close to its ten-year
average.
Outlook and Risks
6.
Bhutan’s near-term outlook is favorable, but overheating risks loom. Growth is
expected to remain at around 8 percent. The current account deficit will remain high due to
hydropower-related imports, but financing from India and other development partners is
expected to be adequate. As a result, the overall balance of payment is projected to remain in
surplus. Inflation is expected to decline while remaining somewhat elevated (at around
6 percent), in line with developments in India. In light of high commodity prices and increased
pass-through from global prices to prices in India, inflation risks are to the upside.
7.
Despite challenges, the medium-term outlook is also positive. Growth is projected to
remain robust at 8–9 percent over the remainder of the 10th Five Year Plan (FYP; 2011–13), in
part driven by the construction of new hydropower projects. The current account deficit is
expected to widen as the construction of the Puna and other hydropower projects pick up steam.
Pressure on the overall balance of payments, however, is expected to remain manageable as
associated loan disbursements from India are also projected to increase.
8.
The risks to this outlook are broadly balanced. In the near term, growth in India
should continue to boost Bhutan’s exports, but on the downside, rapid credit growth and
overheating could increase vulnerabilities. Over the medium term, implementing key structural
reforms is critical to sustaining rapid growth. On the upside, if the development spending crowds
in more private sector investment, higher productivity could provide a boost to the economy.
Strong growth in India should also continue to underpin export growth. At the same time, private
sector development could slow down if implementation capacity constraints are not eased and
the provision of infrastructure by the public sector falls short of envisaged levels. Aid inflows —
particularly current grants — are expected to decline, as Bhutan’s per capita income has risen
rapidly over the last decade. 2 Medium term prospects would also suffer if public investment
financing needs are not met by domestic revenue.

2

Current grants in the form of budgetary support are projected to decline by 7 percentage points to about 10 percent
of GDP over the next couple of years as developing partners scale down their operations. Capital transfers, on the
other hand, are tied to hydropower projects and are envisaged to remain high.

6
Authorities’ views
9.
The authorities broadly share this assessment. They forecast similar growth rates in
the near term, but expect slightly stronger growth over the longer term. As in staff’s baseline
scenario, they also project a widening current account deficit (in relation to GDP) as the
construction of hydropower projects advances further, followed by a correction from 2018.
10.
The authorities share the staff’s view that risks are balanced. They view them
stemming mainly from India’s economic situation. Unlike staff, the authorities do not see an
immediate risk of overheating, but are monitoring credit growth closely. They agree with the
staff that the medium-term challenges revolve around the need to create fiscal space to finance
investment as aid inflows decline and the need to implement structural reforms that will boost
private sector growth and competitiveness.

7
Box 1. Hydropower Sector Issues
Bhutan’s hydropower development has been an important driver of its rapid growth since the first major
hydropower plant (Chhukha, 336MW) was commissioned in 1988. In 2006, when the 1,020 MW Tala plant came
on stream, GDP growth jumped by 5½ percentage points. Currently, the hydropower sector alone constitutes around
20 percent of Bhutan’s economy, and growth in electricity production and related construction accounts for about
one third of GDP growth.
Bhutan currently harnesses a little over 1,480 MW of
hydropower electricity, about 5 percent of its estimated
potential. The government aims to achieve a total installed
capacity of 10,000 MW by 2020. Construction work of
three new projects (Puna-I with a capacity of 1,200 MW,
Puna-II with a capacity of 990 MW, and Mangdechhu with
a capacity of 720 MW) has commenced, and is expected to
be completed by around 2017.

country’s competitiveness. Hydropower exports to India 1/ Inter-governmental undertakings with the Government of India
accounts for almost 40 percent of Bhutan’s total goods 2/ Joint venture undertakings with Indian public sector companies
exports in 2009/10, or about 15 percent of GDP. So far, all the major hydropower projects are financed by the
Government of India through a combination of loans and grants. Four future projects will be developed as joint
ventures with Indian public sector companies with a debt-to-equity ratio of 70:30 and the Indian partner allowed
51 percent equity stake.
The hydropower sector is an important contributor to fiscal revenue, with earnings from the hydropower sector
(corporate income tax and transfers of dividends) accounting for 23 percent of total revenue in 2009/10. However,
hydro-related revenue as a share of GDP is projected to decline until the new projects come on stream, as the
electricity export price is fixed and the construction of the new hydropower plants is exempt from taxes.
Bhutan’s hydropower revenue is also subject to strong seasonality due to the seasonal changes in water levels and
the lack of water storage capacity. More than 50 percent of the annual revenue is generated in the third quarter.
This in turn poses challenges to the government to manage its outflows throughout the fiscal year with volatile
resources. Against this background, the government has continued to assess alternatives to develop a strong cash
management system based on accurate and timely forecasting of government’s cash inflows and outflows to help
mitigate the impact of revenue fluctuations and smooth public sector outlays.
When electricity generation shrinks in the dry winter months (January–March), there is a shortage of power for
domestic consumers and the country has to import electricity from India at a relatively high cost. As the economy
continues to grow rapidly, increasing domestic electricity demand will intensify the seasonal power shortage
problem until the new projects are commissioned. Several strategies, including load shedding for power-intensive
industries, are being considered by the government to address this issue.
Public debt incurred by the hydropower projects accounts for about half of Bhutan’s total debt, which currently
stands at around 80 percent of GDP and is projected to exceed 110 percent in 2014/15. The risks of large public
and external debt are mitigated by the commercial viability of the hydropower projects, which benefit from India’s
strong energy demand.

8
Box 2. Dealing with Revenue Volatility
Fiscal revenue generated by the hydropower sector has been a key contributor to higher public
investment in Bhutan. However, due to the nature of the projects execution and financing, hydropower
revenue and foreign grants have been highly volatile. For instance, nontax revenue rose from 8.5 percent
of GDP in 2005/06 to 17.9 percent in 2008/09 when the Tala project came on stream and paid profit
transfers, but declined to 10 percent in 2009/10 when Tala became a corporation and its revenue
contribution appeared in corporate tax and dividends instead.
At the macro level, the volatility in revenue reflects in part a narrow tax base and little economic
diversification. The share of electricity in aggregate revenue is estimated to average 27 percent during
the 10th Five Year Plan period (2008/09–2012/13). Grants amount for 37 percent of total revenue, with
80 percent of them tied to specific projects. Other taxable activities raise relatively little revenue: for
instance, sales tax was 1.5 percent of GDP in 2008/09, less than half in the average of Asian LICs.
Hydropower revenue is also subject to strong seasonality due to the seasonal changes in water levels.
More than 50 percent of the annual revenue is generated in the third quarter of the year. This in turn
poses challenges to the government to manage its outflows throughout the fiscal year with volatile
resources.
Volatile revenue and grants have often been reflected in volatile public spending, and have had a
negative impact on the level of public investment. A medium-term fiscal framework is needed to ensure
a sustainable fiscal position while minimizing the impact of volatility on the budget and delivering a
more counter-cyclical fiscal policy. In this connection, a smoothing mechanism could be considered that
requires the budget to run surpluses in good times and enables fiscal policy to offset the decline in
hydro-related revenue and grants.
A cash management system based on accurate and timely forecasting of government’s cash inflows and
outflows can also help mitigate the impact of temporary cash shortfalls and smooth public sector
outlays. On this front, the introduction of the T-bills in 2009 is a welcome step.
Efforts are also needed to increase non-hydropower sector revenue to offset the decline in hydropower
related revenue as both income tax and dividend payments from hydropower projects are set in nominal
terms and thus would decline as a share of GDP. Moreover, the only new power sector project expected
to come on stream during the 10th Plan is the Dagachu project (114 MW). Options that have received
consideration include replacing the existing sales tax with a broader-based value-added tax and unifying
the business income tax and personal income tax.
Finally, country experiences show that only those resource-producing countries with a sound
institutional framework and a robust Public Financial Management system have managed to effectively
deal with the “resource curse”.

Box 3. Ease of Doing Business in Bhutan
Bhutan’s economy is dominated by the hydropower sector, but other economic activities are underdeveloped,
partly because it lags behind most emerging economies in Asia on ease of doing business. In Doing Business
2011, Bhutan ranks 142nd among the 183 economies, and its performance is particularly weak in categories of
getting credit, protecting investors, trading across borders, and closing a business.

The “getting credit” indicator reflects credit information registries and the effectiveness of collateral and
bankruptcy laws in facilitating lending. Even though credit to the private sector is growing fast in Bhutan, access
to finance is considered a major constraint to private sector development. The time firms spend to comply with
government regulations and the associated costs are higher compared to regional and international averages.
Given the country’s landlocked geography, the cost of transportation and trading across borders is high.
For countries that rely heavily on exports, improving the ease of doing business can facilitate the growth in nontradable sectors through better allocation of capital and labor. This is particularly relevant for Bhutan as it
attempts to diversify non-hydropower sectors. The experience of other small LIC economies can be useful.
Zambia, a major copper producer, was named among the top ten economies that have improved the ease of doing
business by the World Bank’s Doing Business 2011. The Zambian government made significant progress in
implementing its private sector development reform program (PSDRP). Cost of doing business was reduced by
eliminating the minimum capital requirement, computerizing customs declarations and introducing an electronic
case management system in courts. Although the economy will continue to rely on copper production and export,
development in the domestic sectors such as construction is widely expected to play a more important role in the
country’s growth prospect. It is hard to disentangle the boom in non-exporting sectors from the benefits accrued in
the export sectors, especially when the country is experiencing a terms of trade led boom. Nonetheless, the
experience of Zambia shows that it is possible to achieve fast gains in Doing Business indicators by implementing
economic reforms. Empirical study also suggests that improving from the worst quartile of business regulations to
the best implies a 2.3 percentage point increase in annual growth.
Bhutan’s Vision 2020 pictures that while the country’s economic future will be driven by hydropower
investments, the economy will also be well balanced and sufficiently diversified as a thriving high-value added
agriculture sector, a clean manufacturing base, and a burgeoning hospitality industry start growing rapidly. These
non-hydro power sectors are also expected to contribute in very significant ways towards generating productive
employment for the growing numbers of youth entering the labor market. Improving the ease of doing business
will support diversifying the resources of growth and help achieve these goals. In particular, resources need to be
allocated to human capital investment, especially in tertiary education and vocational training, to create a skilled
domestic labor force.

10
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS: PRESERVING MACROECONOMIC STABILITY AND SUSTAINING
STRONG GROWTH
A recalibration of policy settings is desirable to ensure that the forward momentum continues.
The RMA should adjust monetary settings to help curb credit growth and step up its monitoring
of financial institutions. The fiscal framework could be bolstered by the introduction of a
spending ceiling that would increase the predictability of current expenditure over the near and
medium term. The authorities’ goals of diversifying the economic base as outlined in the new
Economic Development Policy (EDP) are appropriate, but tax incentives should be carefully
evaluated.
A. Fiscal Policy
Background
11.
Fiscal policy has been accommodative, which has contributed to the risk of
overheating. In 2009/10, the current balance declined to an estimated surplus of 4 percent of
GDP and is anticipated to fall further to 2 percent of GDP in 2010/11. The overall balance is
estimated at about 2½ percent of GDP in 2009/10 (compared with a deficit of 6 percent
envisaged in the revised budget), but is also expected to drop sharply to minus 4.5 percent of
GDP in 2010/11. The deterioration in the overall balance reflects: (i) a decline in non-tax
revenue; (ii) sluggishness in tax revenue; (iii) higher current spending following a 35 percent
hike in civil servant wages in January 2009 and 20 percent in early 2011; and (iv) an increase in
capital spending.3,4
12.
The overall balance excluding the hydropower sector (mostly corporate income tax
and profit transfers) is also projected to deteriorate in the near term due to higher public
investment and the decline in grants. In the medium and longer term, buoyancy of nonhydropower tax revenue (due to base broadening) and the planned decline in spending will bring
down the non-hydropower deficit from 10 percent of GDP to 6 percent of GDP.
13.
Public debt has risen owing to new hydropower projects. After declining by nearly
20 percentage points to 68 percent of GDP between 2005 and 2009, public debt has increased in
2009/10 due to the start of new hydropower projects. Public debt is expected to rise further to

Before 2009, nontax revenue included profit transfers and interest payments from the Tala project. When Tala
becomes a corporation, its revenue contribution appears in corporate income tax instead. Since operating profits are
still increasing, tax revenue has not offset the drop in nontax receipts.

Data revisions have been sizable. Generally, they have been due to under-execution of capital spending.

81 percent of GDP by the end of the current fiscal year as a result of investments in the
hydropower sector and rising current spending.
14.
The debt sustainability analysis (DSA) shows a moderate but still significant risk of
distress as most indicative debt thresholds are temporarily breached. Based on the DSA,
public debt is projected to exceed 110 percent of

Staff Advice
15.
While fiscal policy has been generally prudent, the current fiscal settings pose
challenges from both a near-term and a longer-term perspective.


In the near term, fiscal policy should be tightened to address overheating. This can be
achieved by cutting non-priority current spending and saving any revenue
overperformance. A fiscal tightening of about 2 percent of GDP (combined) in 2011 and
2012 would be desirable to help cool growth in aggregate demand. The proposed fiscal
adjustment would encompass primarily current spending and could entail spending
reallocation toward capital projects and other projects with high social returns, especially
in case of grant shortfalls.5 Tax administration should be improved to help reverse the
sluggishness in tax revenue.



To bolster the fiscal framework, the Royal Government of Bhutan (RGB) could consider
introducing a nominal ceiling on current spending (excluding interest). The spending
ceiling would increase the predictability of fiscal policy and at the same time reduce its
procyclicality (e.g., the ceiling would link wage adjustments to inflation forecasts). Over
time, this ceiling would also help create fiscal space, which could be used to: (i) finance

5

Broadly, the proposed tightening would amount to a negative fiscal impulse over the next two years.

12
capital spending as aid inflows are projected to decline, and (ii) increase social spending
should food and energy prices rise significantly from current levels.6 The classification of
spending would have to be monitored closely, as the proposed ceiling would not
encompass capital spending, which is financed mostly with capital grants. The spending
ceiling is based on debt sustainability considerations, and aims to maintain domestic
financing contained. Escape clauses could address tail risks such as natural disasters,
while the fiscal space would provide flexibility in the reallocation of spending. The
proposed ceiling could take the form of an amendment to the existing fiscal rule that
stipulates that current spending should be covered by domestic revenue.


In the medium term, domestic financing should remain limited to ensure sustainable debt
dynamics, which requires both revenue and expenditure reforms. The revenue base
should be broadened to reduce revenue volatility and the dependence on the hydropower
sector and external financing (see Box 2). Introducing the VAT and improving tax
administration should remain key priorities. Implementation of multi-year rolling
budgets, including by specifying three-year rolling ceilings on current spending
consistent with medium term revenue, could better align spending plans with policy
priorities and revenues.7

Authorities’ views
16.
While the authorities view fiscal policy as having been generally prudent, they
concurred that at the moment fiscal settings pose challenges. They underscored that fiscal
measures will be aimed at ensuring that domestic revenue continues to finance current spending.
They also noted that while the wage hikes will need to be financed with higher tax revenues,
non-priority spending should be cut to help create fiscal space.
17.
Regarding medium term fiscal risks, the authorities underscored that there is a need
to boost revenue to address the envisaged decline in foreign aid flows. They were receptive to
the staff’s proposal to create a nominal current spending ceiling to help with the implementation
of medium-term budgets, but added that any such measure would not address the need for more
revenue over the medium term. The authorities also highlighted that revenue measures, including
broadening the tax base and improving tax administration, must be implemented as tax
incentives will likely have an impact on tax buoyancy going forward. Finally, the authorities
broadly agreed with the medium- and long-term debt projections underlying the staff’s DSA.

6

Creating fiscal space will also be important to address declining hydropower-related revenue (in relation to GDP)
during the construction of new plants.

7

Over time, the multi-year budget framework would also help reduce prospective fiscal revisions, as the revised
budget would better reflect interim spending in relation to the overall multi-year envelope.

13
Nonetheless, they reiterated that the commercial viability of the projects, implementation
capacity, and donor support, should allay any concerns about the rapid debt buildup.
B. Monetary and Financial Sector Policies
Background
18.
Recently inflation has accelerated and become more volatile, reflecting price
developments in India, but also accommodative domestic policies. Monetary policy has been
hampered by a weak transmission mechanism, as evidenced by persistent excess liquidity in the
banking system, averaging 40 percent of reserve money in 2010. Short-term interest rates have
declined since end-2009 to 2 percent in early 2011 (negative in real terms), and the spread with
Indian money market rates is currently at minus 500 basis points (compared with a historical
average of minus 250-300 basis points, see Figure 2).
19.
Financial stability indicators have remained stable. With limited financial linkages to
advanced economies, Bhutan’s financial sector has weathered the global financial crisis largely
unscathed. Private sector credit growth, however, has accelerated to nearly 45 percent yoy,
driven by housing and construction sectors as well as personal loans.8 Banks’ CAR was
17 percent in September 2010. While remaining volatile due to seasonality, the gross NPL ratio
of the financial system fell to 8.6 percent as of September 2010 from 15.6 percent at endSeptember 2009. While the decline in NPLs reflects rapid credit growth, it is also driven by loan
recoveries. Loan provisions (as a percent of NPL) increased by 4 percentage points to
43.6 percent.

Monetary conditions need to be tightened to lower excess liquidity and credit
growth. In the near term, the RMA should raise interest rates to help cool down aggregate
demand. This would reduce imports and consequently the demand for Indian rupees. Over the
medium term, the RMA should continue to take steps to improve liquidity management,
including by promoting the development of the interbank market in conjunction with the
Ministry of Finance.
21.
Rapid credit growth also warrants close monitoring. The RMA should stand ready to
adjust existing prudential regulations and norms, such as general provisioning, to help curb large
exposures to specific sectors. These steps would bolster the capacity of Bhutan’s financial
system to withstand a potential deterioration in asset quality and strains in funding, especially for
the new banks.

Private sector credit to GDP has nearly doubled since 2006, reaching 40 percent at end-June 2010.

14

22.
Financial sector supervision should be strengthened, especially in light of greater
competition in the banking sector. While the entry of new banks should improve financial
intermediation, it may also increase credit risk and other systemic vulnerabilities stemming from
rapid credit growth. The RMA should ensure that major commercial banks and other financial
institutions conduct stress tests on a periodic (quarterly) basis and report their findings to the
RMA.
Authorities’ views
23.
While the authorities agreed on the need to monitor credit growth closely, they did
not see the need for higher interest rates at this juncture. In addition, they noted that while
higher interest rates would help keep prospective credit growth in check, they would reduce the
RMA’s profitability as the monetary authority would have to bear the interest cost of mopping
up the excess liquidity. The authorities also added that further fiscal tightening would alleviate
the need for monetary measures to address the high credit growth situation.
24.
The authorities highlighted that they are closely monitoring financial sector risks
and that banks have been properly assessing risks, as evidenced by the level of NPLs. They
also noted that the high credit growth environment has been a feature of a low-income economy
such as Bhutan. The authorities have agreed, however, that further engaging the banks by
conducting periodic stress tests would help the strong credit culture and allow a better
understanding of the underlying financial system risks.
C. External Sector and Structural Issues
Background
25.
The real effective exchange rate (REER) has been stable and close to its ten-year
average (Figure 1). There has been some recent appreciation of the REER in 2010 as inflation
accelerated, but the REER is estimated to be only 5 percent above its historical average. Despite
the somewhat sluggish performance of exports, debt service has remained stable in relation to
exports of goods and services. While wages in the public sector have risen significantly due to
hikes in the last two years, anecdotal evidence indicates that wage inflation in the private sector
(formal and informal) remains contained.

26.
Despite large trade deficits arising from
hydropower-related imports, aid inflows have led
to balance of payments surpluses over the past 5
years. The current account deficit is increasingly due
to the construction of the Puna hydropower project
(Phase I). Pressure on the overall balance of

payments, however, is expected to remain contained as associated loan disbursements from India
are also projected to increase. The reserve position is comfortable, with import coverage at about
10½ months. The convertible currency reserves (currently about 90 percent of the total) have
been rising steadily, in part due to strong donor inflows. Though rising sharply in 2010, rupee
reserves have remained volatile and cover only about 2¼ months of rupee denominated imports.
27.
Government policies envisage economic diversification over the medium term. While
Bhutan has enjoyed robust growth driven by the hydropower sector, the new EDP launched in
early 2010 envisages diversification of the economy. The EDP’s goals encompass rapid growth
in merchandise exports and a boost to the service sector through a combination of various tax
incentives. The initiatives in the EDP also include “green” sectors, consistent with Bhutan’s
emphasis on sustainable development.
Staff Advice
28.
Being close to its historical average, the ngultrum remains broadly in line with its
medium-term equilibrium level and its parity with the Indian rupee is appropriate. Given
Bhutan’s strong ties with India, the peg to the rupee is deemed appropriate and has contributed to
trade integration between the two countries. Nevertheless, fiscal and monetary tightening would
help contain appreciation pressures that have appeared recently. Over the medium term,
productivity improvements can help offset the impact of any real exchange rate appreciation.
29.
The large number of hydropower projects in the pipeline and volatile hydropower
exports to India will likely contribute to volatility in rupee reserves, requiring a more
active reserve management. The authorities could consider revisiting the import coverage floor
for convertible currencies to reduce the costs of drawing on the rupee credit lines. While the
rupee credit lines play a useful role in addressing short-term mismatches in rupee inflows and
outflows, they have become relatively costly given the low yield on convertible currencies. Over
the medium term, export diversification beyond the hydropower sector (e.g., tourism), as
highlighted in the EDP, would also help. The authorities should also carefully assess the cost of
tax incentives provided under the EDP. In this regard, the authorities could consider reforms that
could lower the cost of doing business as a more effective way to develop new sectors (see Box
3).
Authorities’ views
30.
The authorities agreed with the staff’s assessment of the exchange rate level. They
also agreed that tightening aggregate demand policies, including by containing credit growth
would help contain balance of payment pressures and the demand for Indian rupees. They
underscored that the level of convertible currencies reserves is important for the credibility of the
peg, but recognized that more flexibility in reserve management can be obtained by lowering the
convertible currencies import coverage floor to prudent levels, based on balance of payments

16
stress tests. They stressed that while they have not experienced signs of Dutch disease, they
monitor the level of the real exchange rate closely and are actively taking measures to improve
competitiveness by providing incentives for private sector development.
31.
The authorities reiterated that existing exchange rate restrictions on current
account transactions were needed since Bhutan’s international reserves have been built
largely on aid flows. They recognized that such restrictions could be eased gradually as exports
strengthen.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
32.
Bhutan’s growth has remained robust and its medium-term prospects are favorable,
but implementing structural reforms is critical to ensuring sustainable growth. The
economy is expected to grow at 8 percent this year and to continue growing strongly over the
medium term, underpinned by the hydropower sector (including associated construction),
manufacturing, and services. Risks to growth seem broadly balanced but medium term prospects
depend on addressing overheating and implementing critical reforms. Inflation is expected to
remain high, reflecting price developments in India.
33.
With rapid growth and elevated inflation, monetary and fiscal policies should be
tightened to reduce the risk of overheating. The near-term fiscal objectives are likely to be
met, but saving any revenue overperformance and cutting non-priority spending would help
contain aggregate demand. Monetary tightening by raising interest rates would also help cool
credit growth, and prevent balance of payment pressures.
34.
In light of rapid credit growth, financial sector supervision should be strengthened.
While the financial sector is benefiting from rapid growth so far, enhancing the monitoring of
financial institutions is important to better assess system wide risks that could be masked by high
credit growth and spurred by greater competition in the banking system.
35.
Fiscal policy should be tightened in the near term to address overheating, and
spending and revenue reforms are needed to bolster the fiscal framework. Over the medium
term, the sluggishness in tax revenues should be reversed and fiscal space needs to be created to
address declining foreign aid inflows and finance much-needed public infrastructure. Also,
establishing a nominal ceiling on current spending would help create fiscal space over time and
would make fiscal policy more countercyclical. The revenue base should be broadened to
increase tax buoyancy. Multi-year rolling budgets should also be implemented to better align
spending plans with fiscal resources and policy priorities.
36.
Bhutan’s exchange rate peg against the India rupee has served the country well by
helping deliver macroeconomic stability. The real effective ngultrum has appreciated only
modestly and has been close to its long-term average. There are no obvious signs of Dutch

17
disease so far and the authorities are taking measures to ensure that competitiveness is sustained
over the medium term mainly by promoting the diversification of the economy. Bhutan will
continue to enjoy robust growth driven by the hydropower sector, but job creation in that sector
is unlikely to be sufficient to absorb Bhutan’s prospective labor force. The comprehensive
strategy embedded in the EDP identifies activities that have strong job-generating potential and
promotes foreign direct investment and private sector development. Moreover, the thrust of the
EDP is in harmony with Bhutan’s sustainable development strategy and its focus on GNH.
37.
Bhutan maintains restrictions under Article XIV. A careful and gradual easing of
these exchange restrictions would facilitate Bhutan’s acceptance of the obligations under
Article VIII of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement with minimal impact on the balance of
payments. Bhutan also maintains an exchange restriction subject to Fund approval under Article
VIII, Section 2(a). Staff does not recommend approval of this restriction as the authorities have
not provided a timeframe for its removal.
38.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the 24-month cycle
in accordance with the Decision on Article IV Consultation Cycles (Decision No. 14747-(10/96)
(9/28/2010)).

II: BHUTAN—RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP1
(As of April 10, 2011)
World Bank Group’s Country Partnership Strategy
The National Assembly finalized the Tenth Five-Year Plan (10FYP) (2008/09–2012/13) in
January 2009. This is also the RGoB’s Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). The
strategic priorities for the 10FYP are: (i) vitalizing industry; (ii) strengthening national spatial
planning; (iii) synergizing rural-urban development; (iv) expanding strategic infrastructure; (v)
investing in human capital; and (vi) fostering an enabling environment through good governance.
The new Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) covering FY11–14 aligns closely with the
10FYP / PRSP. The International Development Association (IDA) and the International
Finance Corporation (IFC) have jointly prepared the CPS. It emphasizes selectivity, and
envisages World Bank Group (WBG) support for development in Bhutan based on two broad
areas of engagement: (i) economic diversification, job creation, and financial inclusion — with a
view to increased growth and employment led by the private sector; and (ii) spatial planning and
public services — with a view to enhanced living standards for increased well-being. These
areas are underscored by the cross-cutting themes of capacity building for good governance, and
environment. The World Bank’s Board of Executive Directors approved the CPS in November
2010. The establishment of an in-country office in FY11, with a permanent World Bank
Representative and an IFC Country Coordinator, will foster information sharing and close
harmonization of activities.
International Development Association (IDA)
Bhutan is an IDA only country, and qualifies for 100 percent credits. In FY10, Bhutan
exceeded the IDA Gross National Income per capita operational cutoff for the third year in a
row, and became a "gap" country. “Gap” countries receive IDA on hardened terms and are not
eligible for grants, regardless of results of Debt Sustainability Analyses.
Bhutan received resources beyond its original indicative allocation of SDR26.2 million for
the IDA 15 cycle (FY09–11). In FY09, Bhutan had the option of cumulatively frontloading up
to 80 percent of its overall IDA 15 indicative allocation for FY09-11. Bhutan chose to frontload
about SDR5.7 million, to add to its original FY09 allocation of SDR8.0 million. In the aftermath
of the global economic crisis, Bhutan received an additional IDA credit allocation of SDR2.3
million in two stages from the South Asia Region Pilot Crisis Response Window facility in
FY10. Bhutan was impacted in 2009 by natural disasters caused by Cyclone Aila in May and
earthquakes in September and December, which caused estimated losses amounting to US$65

6
million. In response to this, the World Bank sanctioned an emergency IDA credit amounting to
US$10 million for Bhutan, to be committed by end-FY11. Accounting for frontloading and the
additional allocations, Bhutan received IDA 15 credits of SDR8.3 million for FY10 and
SDR13.6 million for FY11. Furthermore, following its commitment to participate in a project
for Strengthening Regional Cooperation for Wildlife Protection in Asia in FY11, Bhutan
received US$5 million credit from intra-regional IDA reallocations. Finally, in January 2011,
Bhutan received a grant of US$5 million from the Food Price Crisis Response Trust Fund.
The indicative IDA 16 (FY12-14) allocation for Bhutan is approximately US$53 million.
Starting from IDA16, Bhutan will be eligible to receive IDA credits with a 25-year maturity, 5year grace period and 1.25 percent interest charge in addition to the standard service and
commitment charges. This involves hardening of terms over FY11, during which Bhutan
received credits with a 20-year maturity, 10-year grace period, and no interest charges.

Lending Program
During the IDA 14 cycle, covering FY06–08, more than SDR32 million in grants were
committed to Bhutan. The IDA 14 allocation financed: (i) a US$15 million First Development
Policy Grant approved in May 2006; (ii) a US$10 million Second Rural Access Roads Project
approved in April 2007; (iii) a US$12 million Second Development Policy Grant approved in
June 2007; (iv) a US$8 million Private Sector Development Project approved in June 2007; (v) a
US $1.5 million Institutional Capacity Building Project for Procurement approved in June 2008;
and (vi) US$1.5 million in additional financing to the ongoing Education Development Project.
The Bank’s Board of Executive Directors approved the following operations during the
IDA 15 cycle, covering FY09–11.


The Board approved the US$20.22 million Development Policy Financing for
Institutional Strengthening in May 2009. The overarching objectives of the operation
are to strengthen institutions to: (i) promote good governance through sound fiscal and
public financial management and procurement, and strong accountability institutions; (ii)
foster dynamic labor markets, ensure skills match, and generate employment; and (iii)
expand access to infrastructure in an environmentally sustainable manner. This operation
closed in March 2010, and has satisfactorily achieved its development objectives.



The Board approved the US$12 million Second Urban Development Project in April
2010. The project development objectives are to: (i) support Bhutan’s municipal reform
program by strengthening municipal finance and management systems in Thimphu and
Phuentsholing; and (ii) improve infrastructure services in northern Thimphu where no
formal services are currently available. The first objective supports the RGoB’s
municipal reform agenda and helps implement the country’s new legal framework for
urban local governments through a series of technical assistance, policy support, training
programs, and studies. The project also aims to help establish an effective
intergovernmental fiscal transfer system. The second objective addresses an urgent need
for serviced urban land in rapidly growing Thimphu City, given the already substantial
and increasing migrant population settling in the peripheries of Thimphu.



The Board approved the US$24.75 million First Development Policy Credit in
November 2010. This is designed as the first in a new programmatic series of budgetary
operations, in support of the RGoB’s medium term reform agenda as articulated in the
10FYP. The overarching objectives of DPC1 are to strengthen institutions to: (i) promote
government efficiency and effectiveness through sound fiscal and public financial
management and procurement, and strong public administration; (ii) foster private sector

8
development by improving the policy environment and facilitating productive
employment opportunities; and (iii) expand access to infrastructure in a sustainable
manner.


The Board approved US$5 million additional financing to the ongoing Decentralized
Rural Development Project in January 2011. This was made available from the Global
Food Crisis Response Program Multi-Donor Food Price Crisis Response Trust Fund.
The original project development objective is to improve market access and increase
agricultural output for rural communities in selected areas of Bhutan. The additional
Grant will help finance the costs associated with scaled-up activities and address the
impact of the continuing high prices associated with essential food commodities. While
the project development objective remains the same, the additional financing will focus
on increasing support to the rehabilitation of irrigation canals, and to rice, potato, and
maize as crops which have the best potential to address food insecurity in Bhutan.

In addition, a regional project for Strengthening Regional Cooperation for Wildlife
Protection in Asia is under preparation towards Board approval in FY11. The project
development objective is to assist the participating governments to build or enhance shared
capacity, institutions, knowledge and incentives to collaborate in tackling illegal wildlife trade
and other select regional conservation threats to habitats in border areas. The RGoB proposes to
access regional IDA funding for US$1.5 million, in addition to utilizing US$0.75 million of its
IDA country allocation. Hence, the RGoB will seek IDA support in the form of a Credit of
US$2.25 million.
Nonlending Program
The Bank provides analytical and advisory services, aiming to help the Government build
capacity in the areas of macroeconomic and fiscal analysis, public expenditure management,
financial management, procurement, private sector development, statistics, and education
quality. During FY06-09, the Bank approved several grants supporting these efforts. A US$7.6
million Sustainable Land Management Project, and a US$2.5 million National Influenza
Preparedness and Response Project were both financed from global trust funds. A Trust Fund
for Statistical Capacity Building (US$250,000) was approved in FY07, and has subsequently
closed. Institutional Development Fund (IDF) Grants to support Introduction of Multi-Year
Rolling Budgets (US$330,000), Improving Public Financial Management (US$290,000),2
Strengthening Institution Capacity for Implementation of Environmental Safeguards
(US$400,000), and Strengthening of the Public Procurement Policy Division (US$484,000)
became effective during this period.
The Bank approved five new Grants for Bhutan in FY10 and FY11.



A US$498,500 IDF Grant for Institutional Strengthening of Ministry of Labor and
Human Resources was approved in May 2010. The objective of the Grant is to
strengthen the institutional capacity of the Ministry of Labour and Human Resources
(MoLHR) to facilitate employment and labor market entry of Bhutanese youth. This
consists of the following sub-components: (i) developing a National Employment Policy
and reviewing Occupational Health and Safety regulations; (ii) developing innovative
Public Private Partnerships (PPP) for skills development training for disadvantaged
youth; and (iii) building the capacity of regional Labour and Employment offices to
promote employment and labor services.



A US$600,000 Bhutan Disaster Risk and Recovery Program was approved in
November 2010, funded by the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery
(GFDRR). Activities under this trust fund will help the RGoB's Department of Disaster
management (DDM) strengthen its disaster management capacity. The Grant's
development objective is reducing disaster risk and strengthening the RGoB's capacity in
better responding to disasters. Particularly, the Grant supports: (i) a multi-hazard risk and
vulnerability assessment and development of a risk atlas; (ii) capacity building for
seismic resistant building design and construction techniques; (iii) strengthening
emergency communications and disaster response; and (iv) conferences focusing on
cultural heritage in the context of disaster management.



A US$123,000 First Initiative Trust Fund for Developing and Strengthening the
Regulatory Framework for Pension, Provident Fund, and Other Such Schemes in
Bhutan was approved in November 2010. The objectives of the Grant are to: (i) review
the National Pension Policy, if needed; (ii) redraft the Pension Act and the regulations to
make it consistent with the Employment and Labor Act of 2007 and the National Pension
Policy of 2010; (iii) review investment policies and opportunities for private pensions.



A US$300,000 Trust Fund for Statistical Capacity Building (TFSCB) was approved in
December 2010. The Grant's development objective is to strengthen capacity of the
National Statistics Bureau (NSB) in priority areas according to Bhutan’s National
Statistics Development Strategy (NSDS). Particularly, the Grant will support measures
to improve: (i) the National Accounts and price statistics, (ii) data infrastructure, (iii) data
dissemination; and (iv) research and data analysis capacity at the NSB. This Grant aims
to enable Bhutan to address the data needs of the country for planning, decision-making,
and monitoring purposes.



A US$500,000 IDF Grant for Strengthening the Institutional Capacity of Druk
Holding and Investments to Improve Corporate Governance in Bhutan was
approved in February 2011. The objective of this Grant is to improve Corporate
Governance (CG) among State Owned Enterprises (SOEs) in Bhutan by providing
technical assistance to Druk Holding and Investments (DHI) to support CG capacity

10
building. The Grant will focus on: (i) enhancing DHI policies, developing CG norms,
and improving performance monitoring for DHI companies; (ii) improving the capacity
of DHI and its holdings through training directors of DHI companies; and (iii) raising
awareness through seminars for media and other stakeholders on the importance of CG.
International Finance Corporation (IFC)
Since Bhutan joined IFC as a member country in 2003 and IFC made its first investment
(supporting the first Foreign Direct Investment) in the country, IFC has been cementing its
presence and support to develop the private sector in Bhutan, including opening an office in
Thimphu with a dedicated staff since November 2009. In the market where the public sector
remains dominant in key sectors, IFC has been providing much needed advisory support to the
RGoB and private sector to lay the ground for building a business-enabling environment while
providing investment support as opportunities arise. In the context of IFC’s South Asia Regional
Strategy and WBG’s CPS in Bhutan, IFC’s support in Bhutan centers on three strategic pillars,
including: (i) inclusive growth; (ii) climate change mitigation and adaptation; and (iii) global /
regional integration. Reflecting these pillars, IFC is providing support to develop the private
sector through investment climate improvement, financial sector modernization, real sectors and
infrastructure development, and assistance with Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) and linkages.
IFC’s advisory support is geared toward strengthening four areas: investment climate; financial
sector infrastructure, including financial inclusion; PPPs; and skills development and the Small
and Medium Enterprises (SME) sector. South Asia Enterprise Development Facility (SEDF),
established in partnership with DFID and NORAD, has been at the center of IFC's advisory
support for Bhutan.
In order to help facilitate healthy investment climate, IFC (though SEDF) assisted the RGoB in
upgrading the FDI Policy and welcomed improved clarity and attractiveness of the revised
Policy that came into effect in June 2010. Working closely with the World Bank, IFC assisted
the RGoB with optimization of the company registration process, and now through its Licensing
Simplification Project is working to improve the overall efficiency of business entry. It will
improve regulatory procedures to obtain permits and licenses and establish e-License Portal.
This, along with the adoption of the Enterprise Registration Act drafted with assistance from IFC
to will reduce administrative burden to establishing or expanding a business and help facilitate
trade and access to land.
To support financial sector development, IFC has provided Bank of Bhutan and Bhutan National
Bank with four trade line facilities totaling US$1.8 million under Global Trade Finance Program
(GTFP) since FY2009. The financial support was combined with advisory support, such as on
risk management and Information Technology (IT) strategy. IFC is committed to continued
development of the financial sector in Bhutan and is keen to explore further opportunities,
including support for non-bank financial institutions (such as for SME finance, rural finance,
trade finance) and commercial banks (such as with credit lines and participation in equity).
Building on the diagnostic study conducted jointly with the World Bank, IFC is prepared to

11
support further modernization of payment systems in Bhutan. IFC is exploring possible support
through both investment and advisory services to expand the availability of financial services,
including payments and leasing for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises.
In addition, IFC is interested in supporting the development of Bhutanese tourism, agribusiness,
education and infrastructure, especially through its investment business but also advisory
engagements focusing on linkages and PPPs. Opportunities are arising in Bhutan to develop
and strengthen niche export markets, such as organic agriculture, which IFC is keen on opening
up in order to support rural development. IFC successfully supported Association of Bhutan
Women Entrepreneurs to scale-up initiative that introduced commercial agriculture to women in
remote villages. In infrastructure, IFC remains interested in supporting people’s increased access
to services in ICT, hydropower and transport (including bus and aviation) through investments
and PPP advisory services. To this end, IFC’s PPP advisory team continues to explore
opportunities to strengthen Bhutan’s infrastructure provision and advise the RGoB on bankable
PPP options to involve private sector. Presently, building on its regional and global expertise as
PPP transaction advisor, IFC is in discussion with RGoB, support to bring in private sector
players to participate in city’s bus service operation and solid waste management. IFC also
completed an operational and financial diagnostic review of Druk Air, the national airline, and a
preliminary assessment of two sites proposed for development of industrial estates or potential
Special Economic Zones (SEZ).
As of February 2011, IFC’s portfolio stood at US$6.9 million, consisting of a hotel project
committed in FY2004 and trade guarantees under the GTFP.

III: BHUTAN—RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
Bhutan became a member in 1982 and ADB began its lending operations to the country in 1983.
Bhutan is classified under group “A” with a 50:50 mix of ADF loan and ADF grant assistance
since 2011 and 80 percent cost-sharing limit for project financing.
ADB’s work has followed closely Bhutan’s Tenth Five-Year Plan, 2008–2013, and is guided by
ADB’s Country Strategy and Program (CSP), approved in September 2005, and its country
operations business plan, 2011–2013. The country assistance program evaluation, conducted in
2010, concluded that the strategy of poverty reduction through program and project assistance in
four core sectors (transport, energy (including rural electrification and renewable energy), urban
sector development, and finance and private sector development) is closely aligned with the
development priorities articulated in the government’s Tenth Five-Year Plan 2008–2013 and
Strategy 2020, ADB’s Long-Term Strategic Framework, 2008–2020.
The CSP is being implemented in coordination with other development partners to avoid
duplication. Examples of effective partnerships include ADB’s rural electrification loans
following the Rural Electrification Master Plan, which was developed with assistance from the
Government of Japan. Similarly, development partners are using the Road Sector Master Plan,
which was developed with ADB assistance. ADB has maintained close cooperation with other
multilateral and bilateral funding agencies in capacity building.
The indicative cumulative value for the period 2011−2013 is $55 million. A project on urban
infrastructure has been programmed for 2011. Domestic airport development and rural road
infrastructure projects are on the pipeline for 2012. Urban infrastructure development project is
on the pipeline for 2013. A nonlending program of $1.7 million per year has been programmed
for 2011−2013.

IV. BHUTAN —STATISTICAL ISSUES APPENDIX
As of March 15, 2011
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. Most affected areas
are: national accounts, balance of payments, and fiscal data.
Real sector: As part of a Japan-funded technical assistance project for the Implementation of the System of
National Accounts and the International Comparison Project that will take place over the next three years, the
Statistics Department of the IMF (STA) will provide technical assistance to improve the national accounts and
develop a producer price index.
National Accounts: The accuracy and reliability of the data are affected by inadequate source data. Key
shortcomings include heavy reliance on production data collected by line ministries, which often lack quality
control, long lags in providing estimates, large revisions of historical data and, in certain cases, ad hoc
estimation procedures. Lack of reliable data on expenditure components hampers estimation of national savings
and domestic investment. The key factors contributing to the data deficiency are the shortage of qualified
personnel and facilities. The National Statistical Bureau (NSB) is also constrained by the absence of a Statistics
Act.
Price statistics: Starting in 2004, the consumer price index (CPI) is compiled on a quarterly basis, the number
of commodity prices has been greatly expanded, and the geographical scope broadened. An STA technical
assistance mission planned for April 25–May 6, 2011 will assist with the development of a producer price
index.
Government finance statistics: Despite recent improvements in the quality of government finance statistics
(GFS), the fiscal data are subject to frequent and substantial revisions, particularly in the expenditure area. The
compilation and dissemination of budget execution data and GFS are very limited. Only annual budget
execution data are compiled and disseminated, but with a long lag. No GFS are disseminated nationally.
Sub-annual data on budget execution are not available. There are inconsistencies between the fiscal and
monetary data with regard to bank financing, stemming from differences in the definition of government.
Monetary statistics: While monetary statistics are generally consistent with the Fund’s guidelines, there is
room for improvement in a number of areas, specifically: (i) the valuation of financial assets is based on
purchase price while market or market-price equivalents would be preferable; (ii) to avoid misclassifications, a
list of government units and nonfinancial public enterprises should be prepared and shared with the reporting
financial institutions; During the technical assistance mission on Monetary and Financial Statistics (MFS) in
March 2010, the authorities and STA improved the timeliness of data reporting to STA to be in line with
national publications. As part of the mission objectives, the Royal Monetary Authority (RMA) has also
submitted to STA the Financial Soundness Indicators (FSI) for Bhutan on a quarterly basis, which have been
published on the IMF’s FSI website: http://fsi.imf.org/.
Balance of payments: Despite recent improvements, external statistics continue to be affected by
shortcomings. These include: (i) limited coverage of services’ transactions in the current account, (ii)
compilation of trade data on a quarterly basis, while other external transactions are compiled on a fiscal year
basis. Consequently, errors and omissions in the balance of payments presentations are large and preclude a
more accurate assessment of external flows.
Building on the technical assistance mission in June 2009, a mission in March 2011, in conjunction with the
RMA, developed the International Investment Position for Bhutan and a plan for improvement in balance of
payments statistics. It includes a quarterly business survey, improved estimation methods, and increased
timeliness. The RMA advised that they plan to compile and disseminate quarterly balance of payments data in
the future. Bhutan began supplying balance of payments data for publication in IFS in November 2010.

Joint IMF/World Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis 20111
Prepared by the staffs of the International Monetary Fund and
the International Development Association
Approved by Laura Papi and Christian Mumssen (IMF)
Jeffrey Lewis and Deepak Bhattasali (IDA)
May 13, 2011
Bhutan’s external and public debt dynamics are analyzed within the IMF-World Bank Debt
Sustainability Framework for Low Income Countries (LIC-DSA).2 While the development of
the hydropower sector will lead to a substantial increase in external debt—with debt ratios
breaching some country-specific LIC-DSA indicative thresholds—the staff’s assessment is
that the external debt dynamics remains subject to a moderate risk of distress. As in previous
DSAs, this assessment is based on: the commercial viability of the hydropower projects, the
risk sharing agreement with India for hydropower loans, Bhutan’s strong track record of
project implementation, rapid growth in energy demand from India, committed donor
support, and Bhutan’s high level of international reserves. The debt sustainability analysis
underscores the importance of sustaining rapid economic growth going forward and
containing domestically financed fiscal deficits.
I. BACKGROUND
1.
After peaking in 2004/05, Bhutan’s public and publicly guaranteed debt declined
by 17 percentage points to 68 percent of GDP at end 2008/09.3 Public debt declined
following the completion of the Tala hydropower project—which was entirely financed by

This DSA was prepared jointly by the IMF and the World Bank, and in accordance with the Debt Sustainability
Framework for low-income countries approved by the Executive Boards of the IMF and the IDA. The data
underlying the analysis are from the Bhutanese authorities, and IMF and World Bank staff estimates.

Implications” (http://www.imf.org/external/np/pdr/sustain/2004/020304.htm), “Debt Sustainability in LowIncome Countries: Further Considerations on an Operational Framework and Policy Implications”

Application of the Joint Bank-Fund Debt Sustainability Framework for Low-Income Countries.”

Public debt does not include state-owned enterprise debt, with the exception of hydropower projects loans and
the purchase of one aircraft for state-owned Druk Air in 2004/05. The other SOEs’ debt is very small.

India—and by the onset of the repayment of the associated Indian rupee debt.4 Rupeedenominated hydropower sector debt (41 percent of GDP) accounts for 62 percent of external
debt, which in turn accounts for more than 95 percent of total public debt. Convertible
currency debt has remained relatively range bound, reaching 34 percent of GDP in 2009/10.5
The actual outturn of public debt indicators for last two years was slightly more favorable
than projected in the previous DSAs since better-than-expected fiscal outturns compensated
for the more rapid accumulation of rupee debt.6 Domestic debt, all denominated in local
currency and held by domestic financial institutions, has also declined on the back of rapid
growth and relatively strong fiscal outturns during the same period.

II. UNDERLYING DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS ASSUMPTIONS
2.
The baseline scenario continues to be predicated on the assumption that Bhutan
stays on schedule on its planned expansion in power generation capacity (10,000 MW of
installed capacity by 2020).7 The baseline scenario incorporates Punatsangchu I (Puna I),
Punatsangchu II (Puna II), and Mangdechu hydropower projects.8 These projects are financed
4

In the whole Annex, the term rupee refers to the Indian rupee.

5

Convertible currency debt mainly comprises loans from multilateral institutions, including $9½ million
commercial debt extended by the IFC, making all external debt public or publicly guaranteed.
6

For instance, in the 2009 DSA, growth was projected at 6½ percent in 2009/10, with external debt reaching
69 percent of GDP. Instead, provisional estimates put growth at 7½ and external debt was 3½ percentage points
lower. Likewise, average GDP growth is projected to be nearly 2 percentage points over the next five years,
owing to stronger construction activity and higher capital spending. The higher GDP growth projection
accounts for the bulk of the slower pace of debt accumulation relative to the previous DSA.

7

The new hydropower development policy of Bhutan consists of ten hydropower projects, which would
quintuple Bhutan’s power generation capacity. The other projects are still on paper and the exact financing
arrangements are under discussion with the GOI and other partners such as Indian companies (see Box 1 of the
2011 Staff report).
8

Puna I’s power generation capacity is 1,200 MW. Puna II’s power generation capacity will be 990 MW, while
Mangdechu’s will be 720 MW. Debt service will begin after the commissioning of the projects and will
continue for 12 years. As in the cases of Tala and Puna I, the interest payments accumulated during construction
are expected to be repaid following project completion, but without being capitalized.

3
by the Government of India (GOI) through a combination of loans and grants (see also Box 1
in the 2011 Staff Report).9 The intergovernmental implementation agreements on Puna II and
Mangdechu were signed in April 2010 and pre-construction works are underway.
Repayments will start after the projects come on stream in 2019. External financing for nonhydropower sector activities is expected to remain predominantly from multilateral and
bilateral donors at concessional terms.
3.
The overall economy will remain driven by the hydropower sector, as outlined in
the following baseline macroeconomic assumptions:


Real sector: As in the case of the Tala project, when real GDP growth spiked in
2006/07, the Puna I, Mangdechu and Puna II projects are expected to boost economic
growth as they come on stream. In addition, hydropower construction will also be a
main contributor to growth. Real growth excluding hydropower-related activity is
projected to remain robust at about 6–7 percent over the medium and long term,
underpinned by tourism and other services. With the ngultrum pegged to the rupee,
inflation is projected to remain broadly in line with inflation in India, initially
averaging 7-8 percent in the near term and declining gradually to 4–5 percent over the
medium term.



External sector: The current account deficit is expected to widen over the medium
term because of strong growth in import demand associated with the construction
phase of the new hydropower projects, as well as Tala’s debt service. Upon the
completion of hydropower projects, however, electricity exports are expected to more
than triple from current levels, and the current account deficit should decline over the
longer term, leading to balance of payment surpluses from 2019.10



Fiscal sector: The hydropower projects will boost the domestic revenue-to-GDP ratio
as they are completed after the new hydropower projects come on stream around
2017/18. Revenue will also benefit from an envisaged broadening of the tax base over
time as well as improvements in tax administration.11 Offsetting those developments,

9

Although the financing of hydropower projects is non-concessional (i.e., below the 35% grant element for
LICs), there is a certain level of concessionality stemming from the grant portion of financing and the
exemption from payment of interest during construction.
10

The unusual shape of the grant element of new disbursement in figure 1a reflects the composition of new
loans. Under the standard DSA assumptions, rupee debt appears non-concessional since the interest rate of
11 percent exceeds the 4 percent discount rate. Thus, until 2016/17, when rupee disbursements dominate
external financing, the grant element appears low. However, it starts rising once the rupee-financed
hydropower projects are completed, and concessional loans from multilateral and bilateral development partners
take stage.
11

Measures to broaden the tax base and improve administration include rationalizing sales and customs tax
rates, broadening the sales tax base, and eventually introducing a VAT.

4
however, is the sharp projected decline in external aid, leaving the overall fiscal
balance should remain broadly stable over the forecast horizon. Primary deficits arise
over the medium term mainly because the decline in aid inflows does not lead to a
similar compression of public investment, which would be detrimental to growth.

III. EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
A. Baseline
4.
The hydropower sector cycles will remain the driver of Bhutan’s external debt.
External debt in relation to GDP is projected to rise by 26 percentage points between 2009/10
and 2012/13 as disbursements for new hydropower projects increase. The debt ratios remain
above the LIC-DSA indicative threshold for strong policy performance countries until
2016/17 for the PV of external debt as a share of exports and revenue, and until 2019/20 for
the PV of external debt to GDP.12 Debt ratios are projected to decline steadily with the start
of debt repayment even as new projects are commissioned. The debt service-to-export and
the debt service-to-revenue ratios are expected to remain below the indicative thresholds for
the entire projection period.
B. Sensitivity Analysis
5.
Debt ratios are most vulnerable to exchange rate shocks, export growth shocks,
and unfavorable financing terms, but are expected to decline under almost all
alternative scenarios. Importantly, the debt ratios are also projected to fall below the
thresholds by 2020 in almost all cases considered. In the case of a 30 percent nominal
depreciation in 2009/10, the PV of debt rises to more than 140 percent of GDP. But such
extreme scenario overestimates Bhutan's debt vulnerability since a large share of Bhutan's
receipts are in rupees, which provide a natural hedge to the rupee-denominated debt. The
12

Bhutan’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) index for 2009 was 3.89 (average of 3.86 for
2006–08), which classifies it as a strong performer with regard to its policies and institutions. The indicative
thresholds for strong performers are 50, 200 and 300 for the PV of debt in percent of GDP, exports, and revenue
respectively, and 25 and 35 for debt service in percent of exports and revenue. The PV of external debt is
calculated assuming the standard discount rate of 4 percent for both rupee and convertible currency debt.

5
export growth shock and more unfavorable financing terms for new borrowing increase debt
ratios. 13 If the growth rate is slower than envisaged, debt distress indicators will only slightly
deviate from the baseline scenario.
6.
Under the most extreme shock scenario, the debt service-to-revenue ratio would
temporarily breach the indicative threshold as Puna II and Mangdechu’s debt service
begins; but even in this scenario, it is expected to remain below the threshold for the rest of
the projection period. The historical scenario shows explosive debt dynamics, as it does not
fully capture the entire cycle of construction and operation of the hydropower projects.
IV. PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
A. Baseline
7.
The baseline public debt dynamics is determined by that of external debt. The
public debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to rise with the start of new hydropower projects
(peaking at 110 percent of GDP in 2014/15) and subsequently decline until it reaches
35 percent of GDP by end 2029/30. In spite of the volatility in hydropower-related revenue
related to seasonality, it is assumed that revenue gains materialize when the new hydropower
projects come on stream, and revenues stabilize at around 20 percent of GDP.14 Given
Bhutan’s robust growth and strong overall performance, external financing is projected to
shrink as a share of GDP. As domestic financing increases temporarily during the 2010–2015
to offset declining grants, domestic debt is projected to reach about 20 percent of GDP by
2014/15 and be broadly stable around that level as share of GDP for the remainder of the
projection period.
B. Sensitivity Analysis
8.
Given the large share of external debt in total public debt and the impact of
exchange rate shocks on the former, overall public debt is most vulnerable to exchange
rate shocks. A one-time depreciation leads to an upward shift in the various public debt
indicators, while leaving the broad shape of the debt indicators’ path unchanged. Under the
historical scenario (assuming a primary deficit of 2⅓ percent of GDP), public sector debt
would rise and remain at a high level over the long term. Such a scenario also shows the
importance of containing fiscal deficits to help ensure that public debt remains sustainable.
Finally, if borrowed resources were not used productively, the debt ratios would deteriorate
13

This scenario envisages real GDP growth at its historical average minus one standard deviation (tables 2a and
3b).

14

The strong seasonal patterns of electricity generation stem from seasonality in water levels. While such
seasonal patterns generate volatility in revenues from hydropower exports within the fiscal year, annual
hydropower exports can be reasonably well estimated. Hence, the effect of revenue volatility on debt
sustainability is small.

6
markedly. The “high investment, low growth” scenario is unlikely given the commercial
viability of the projects and Bhutan’s strong implementation capacity, but such scenario
highlights the risks from lower than anticipated growth payoff of the debt-financed
hydropower projects. For instance, if investment in the hydropower sector does not generate
any growth, public debt will peak at 125 percent of GDP and decline at a much slower speed
(Table 2a).
V. STAFF ASSESSMENT
9.
As in the 2009 IMF/World Bank Joint DSA, Bhutan’s external debt dynamics
are deemed sustainable but subject to a moderate risk of distress. As noted above,
policy-related LIC-DSA thresholds for external debt are breached for several indicators, but
they remain so for a shorter period than in the previous DSA. In addition, the new
hydropower projects are widely expected to boost exports and overall GDP growth.15 While
the debt stock is expected to increase substantially, the new hydropower projects do not
entail significant vulnerabilities to debt servicing as debt-service ratios remain below
indicative thresholds.

10.

In addition, as in previous DSAs, several mitigating factors are at play:



Commercial viability of new hydropower projects. Puna I is expected to have a higher
internal rate of return, given lower costs of construction than Tala and a larger
generation capacity. At the same time, the internal rate of return for Puna II and

15

Focusing on the average growth over a 20-year period, which appears little affected by the addition of the
new hydropower projects, understates the economic impact of these projects. At commissioning, these projects
will generate large spikes in real GDP growth, boost incomes and exports; however, with generation capacity
fixed, the impact on growth after commissioning will be limited.

7
Mangdechu are expected to remain high at about 11–14 percent,16 significantly higher
than the effective cost of financing (estimated at about 8 percent).


Bhutan’s strong track record of project implementation. In light of this, new
hydropower projects are expected to remain subject to low implementation risk.



Strong ties with India. Bhutan is widely expected to maintain close economic ties
with India, which has been the main provider of financing for hydropower projects.
Given India’s sizable power deficit, its demand for Bhutan’s hydropower electricity
should remain high for decades to come. At the project level, operational risks
(including those related to natural disasters) shall be borne by the Government of
India; hydropower-related loans do not represent contingent liabilities for the Royal
Government of Bhutan.

11.
The authorities broadly agreed with the debt projections underlying the staff’s
DSA as well as the staff’s assessment. However, they underscored the importance of the
mitigating factors outlined in the staff’s analysis, particularly the commercial viability of the
projects and strong donor support.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
May 31, 2011

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2011 Article IV Consultation
with Bhutan
On May, 27, 2011, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Bhutan.1
Background
Following its transition into a parliamentary democracy in 2008, Bhutan has enjoyed political
stability and the transition to a full participatory democracy has proceeded steadily. Growth has
been strong, averaging around 8 percent in the last decade. The hydropower sector, supported
by grants and strong ties to from India, has been the main driver, while construction and the
services sector also saw robust growth. Inflation has risen, tracking closely price developments
in India, which supplies about three-quarters of Bhutan’s imports. Social development indicators
are progressing steadily, and Bhutan is on track or has achieved most of its Millennium
Development Goals.
Bhutan’s near-term outlook is favorable, but there are risks of overheating. Growth is expected
to remain at around 8 percent. The current account deficit will remain high due to hydropowerrelated imports, but financing from India and other development partners is expected to be
adequate. As a result, the overall balance of payment is projected to remain in surplus. At the
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
same time, inflation is expected to decline while remaining somewhat elevated (at around
6 percent), with inflation risks to the upside.
Despite challenges, the medium-term outlook is also positive. Growth is projected to remain
robust at 8–9 percent over the remainder of the 10th Five Year Plan (FYP; 2011–13), in part
driven by the construction of new hydropower projects. The current account deficit is expected
to widen as the construction of hydropower projects pick up steam. Pressure on the overall
balance of payments, however, is expected to remain manageable as associated loan
disbursements from India are also projected to increase.
Over the medium term, implementing key structural reforms is critical to sustaining rapid growth.
If the development spending crowds in more private sector investment, higher productivity could
provide a boost to the economy. Strong growth in India should also continue to underpin export
growth. At the same time, private sector development could slow down if implementation
capacity constraints are not eased and the provision of infrastructure by the public sector falls
short of envisaged levels. Aid inflows — particularly current grants — are expected to decline,
as Bhutan’s per capita income has risen rapidly over the last decade. Medium term prospects
would also suffer if public investment financing needs are not met by domestic revenue.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed Bhutan’s strong economic performance in recent years and the
steady progress on social indicators. The medium-term prospects are favorable, anchored by
hydropower sector development. Notwithstanding these positive developments, the economy
faces near-term challenges, especially overheating stemming from higher prices, strong
economic growth and rapid credit expansion. Directors encouraged the authorities to tighten
macroeconomic policies, while continuing their efforts to promote economic diversification.
Directors emphasized that tighter monetary policy should help mitigate the risk of overheating.
In general, they observed that raising interest rates would help curb credit growth, which would
in turn reduce balance of payments pressures. Directors also encouraged the authorities to
closely monitor excess liquidity and improve the monetary transmission mechanism.
Directors welcomed increased competition in the banking system and stressed that stronger
regulatory and supervision capacity would safeguard financial stability.
Directors agreed that a tighter fiscal stance is essential for sustaining macroeconomic stability
and that spending and revenue reforms would bolster the fiscal framework. Establishing a
nominal ceiling on current spending would help create fiscal space for capital spending and
make fiscal policy more countercyclical. Directors encouraged the authorities to implement
revenue measures to help finance prospective public investment. Given the concentration of
debt in commercially viable hydropower projects and India’s rapid energy demand growth,
Directors generally agreed that Bhutan’s risk of debt distress remains moderate.

3
In light of Bhutan’s strong ties with India, Directors agreed that the peg with the Indian rupee
remains appropriate and that it has served the country well. They noted that promoting the
diversification of the economy and facilitating private sector development would help strengthen
Bhutan’s competitiveness and balance of payments position.
Directors encouraged progress towards the timely elimination of the exchange restrictions
subject to approval under Article VIII and the restrictions maintained under Article XIV.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by Arvind Virmani, Executive Director for Bhutan
and Navin Kumar Choudhary, Advisor to Executive Director
May 27, 2011
On behalf of our Bhutanese authorities, we thank staff for a balanced and well-written report
that captures the candid and comprehensive discussions during the mission. The authorities
share staff’s assessment on many aspects while highlighting that Bhutan’s development
experience warrants an appropriate tailoring of macroeconomic policy settings. Our
authorities emphasize that they attach the highest value to their engagement with staff and
broadly concur with the thrust of the policy advice in the staff report.
Recent Economic Developments and Outlook
At the outset it is important to note the distinguishing characteristics of the economic and
social conditions in Bhutan. A small, landlocked country, with an economy closely
intertwined with India, Bhutan is experiencing rapid and robust growth in an environment of
societal well-being and political stability that now encompasses a vibrant and inclusive
democracy. Real GDP growth is expected to remain 8 percent or above in the near term with
an upside outlook that reflects positive spillovers from India’s rapid growth and associated
expansion of Bhutan’s hydropower sector.
Inflation, which is essentially driven by food prices as in other emerging and developing
countries, is emerging as a key risk to this outlook. Our authorities are conscious of the
danger of inflation pressures getting entrenched and are accordingly monitoring the price
situation with a readiness to take remedial policy action. So far, however, inflation is mainly
related to food prices.
While the current account deficit has widened sharply since 2009/10, this is essentially
related to imports for large expansion of hydropower capacity in response to buoyant power
demand from India. As staff has noted, the current account deficit is comfortably financed
by loans from India tied to hydroelectricity projects. This has shored up the foreign
exchange reserves which are currently equivalent of nearly a year’s imports. Going forward,
our authorities expect the current account deficit to narrow as hydropower exports rise, and
become self-financing.
Although signs of overheating are muted at the current juncture, our authorities are aware
that it could become a policy challenge. They remain vigilant on this account and agree with
staff that fiscal and broader structural reforms are essential to diversify the economy,
improve absorptive capacity and enhance productivity over the medium-term. Infrastructure
development has a vital role to play in catalyzing structural change and in this context, the
role of fiscal policy is central.
Fiscal Policy
After remaining in surplus, the overall balance is likely to be negative in 2010/11 due to large
increase in capital spending. An overall deficit is likely to persist in view of planned capital
spending on new hydroelectric power plants in the coming years. Since these capital

2
spending are financed by capital grants (which are likely to grow accordingly), and are
productive, our authorities do not see it as a source of concern.
Other factors which have also contributed to the deficit are the decrease in non-tax revenues,
and modest increase in current spending. In this context, it is important to note that the
decline in the non-tax revenues partially reflects the seasonal nature of hydropower revenue
as well as their re-classification under tax revenues as stated by staff in Box 2. Also, the
increase in current expenditure last year was due to a one-off salary increase based on the
recommendation of a commission set up to examine the case for an increase in public sector
wages, which was due for some time.
As noted by the staff, fiscal policy has been generally prudent. However, to meet the nearterm and longer-term challenges, our authorities value the dialogue with staff on the
desirability of introducing a nominal ceiling on current spending. For our authorities, a key
medium-term macroeconomic priority is to increase tax revenue. This is important not only
for fiscal sustainability and a prudent level of public debt, but also to meet the growing
development needs. As noted by staff, debt sustainability risks are mitigated by the
concentration of debt in commercially viable hydropower projects. Given that the energy
demand from India is not likely to go down and that there is a good track record in project
implementation and governance, the authorities do not see the risk of debt distress
materializing. Nevertheless, they recognize the need to diversify the tax base, increase nonhydroelectric tax revenue, improve the efficiency of tax administration, reduce the volatility
of tax-revenues, and improve the revenue productivity. Our authorities note staff’s advice to
introduce VAT, but considering that it will require considerable amount of ground work and
capacity building, they look forward to further in-depth discussion in this regard.
Monetary, Financial and Exchange Rate Policies
Monetary conditions are stable and the monetary policy stance has been appropriate so far,
although recent inflation developments pose risks and challenges, calling for intensified
monitoring, as stated earlier.
With the opening of two new banks, competition has increased in the banking sector. NPLs
have declined on account of improved loan recoveries and financial stability indicators have
remained largely stable. Our authorities are mindful of risk factors such as rapid growth in
private sector credit and excess liquidity in the banking system, especially in the context of
preserving financial stability. Our authorities will, therefore, continue to carefully monitor
credit and liquidity conditions and stand ready to take appropriate policy measures to ensure
macroeconomic and financial stability. The suggestion to develop an interbank market in
conjunction with the finance ministry is welcome as also the deepening of macro prudential
supervision, including through periodical stress tests.
As pointed out by staff, the exchange rate has evolved in alignment with macroeconomic
fundamentals. The peg with the Indian Rupee is also deemed appropriate in the context of
Bhutan’s high degree of integration with the Indian economy. It is in this context that our
authorities also emphasize reserve management policies that shore up Indian rupee reserves
while flexibly managing convertible currency reserves.

Development Perspective
Bhutan is continuing to make rapid progress in improving all social indicators and is well on
course to achieve most of the Millennium Development Goals. In this context, Bhutan’s
experience can be regarded as unique in at least one key aspect. Bhutan follows the concept
of “Gross National Happiness” or GNH which rests on four pillars of values – sustainable
and equitable development, good governance, environmental conservation, and cultural
preservation and promotion. These pillars are divided into nine domains which, in turn, are
broken down to 72 measurable variables. For example, one variable reflects Bhutan’s
commitment to maintain at least 60 percent forest cover forever. While keeping GNH as
central to its development planning, our authorities are vigorously diversifying the economy.
The most critical sector for Bhutan’s development is the hydropower sector; the
developments therein have been presented well in Box-1 of the Staff Report. We would like
to inform that projects under construction are well on schedule, with a few ahead of
timelines. Another sector where our authorities are putting in substantial effort is the tourism
sector. They are aiming to attract one hundred thousand visitors in the next couple of years,
up scaling from the current level of thirty five thousand tourists a year. They are focused on
diversifying tourism from cultural to nature-based products, opening of new areas and
strengthening infrastructure and connectivity therein.
In conclusion, our Bhutanese authorities look forward to sustained support and engagement
with the international community as they strive to achieve their developmental goals. They
regard as vital to this effort sound macroeconomic advice from the Fund on a regular basis
and support in terms of capacity building in the Central Bank and other institutions through
technical support and training.
