IMF Executive Board Concludes 2015 Article IV Consultation with Togo
On October 26, 2015, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation1 with Togo.
Economic growth has remained strong in recent years, averaging 5.4 percent in 2013-14, on the
back of productivity gains in the agricultural sector and public investment in transport
infrastructure. The fast pace of public investment has laid the basis for higher growth but has
also contributed to a pronounced increase in public debt and current account deficit. Public debt
has increased from 46 percent of GDP in 2012 to 58 percent in 2014. The current account deficit
widened from 7.5 percent of GDP in 2012 to 13 percent of GDP in 2013–14, primarily as a result
of higher imports linked to the development of the transportation network. Inflation slowed to
0.2 percent in 2014 mainly due to declining food prices and reductions in retail fuel prices.
Output growth is expected to be sustained over the medium term, although current account and
debt pressures are unlikely to abate and the global environment has deteriorated. Growth is
expected to average 5.5 percent in 2015–18, supported by agricultural production, transportation
services linked to international trade, and the impact of investments in transport infrastructure,
which should facilitate private economic activity. The current account deficit is projected to
improve marginally to 12.25 percent of GDP in 2015 as a result of lower oil prices and narrow
only to 9.5 percent of GDP by 2020 with the gradual decline in the fiscal deficit and increased

savings of state-owned enterprises. Inflation is expected to remain subdued in line with WAEMU
trend. The risks to baseline forecasts are largely home-grown, although a sharp slowdown in
regional or global growth would inevitably have an impact, mainly through the key trading
partners in the region.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors welcomed Togo’s strong economic growth in recent years on the back of
productivity gains in agriculture and public infrastructure investment, which have yielded
improvements in social indicators. They noted, however, that the rapid pace of public investment
has raised public debt and the current account deficit. Directors emphasized the need to improve
fiscal balances and complete the implementation of key fiscal reforms, address financial sector
weaknesses, and promote structural transformation to foster more inclusive growth.
Directors underscored the need to place fiscal balances on a sustainable path to ensure debt and
external sustainability and create space for social spending. They advised anchoring public
finances on a domestic primary balance to reduce the public debt-to-GDP ratio over the medium
term. In this regard, they emphasized the need to control current spending, including by
continuing to reduce fuel subsidies. They also highlighted the importance of raising the
efficiency of public investment to ensure it raises growth. Directors underscored the importance
of enhancing public financial and debt management and urged completion of key fiscal reforms,
including the reorganization of the Ministry of Finance, developing an effective debt and
treasury cash management, establishing a treasury single account, and modernizing revenue
administration.
Directors emphasized the need to enforce the regulatory framework in the financial sector,
resolve problem banks, and strengthen supervision in the microfinance sector. They
recommended that banks with weak regulatory indicators should take immediate corrective
action or be subject to resolution. They supported implementing least-cost resolution options
when dealing with nonviable financial entities.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of

Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers
used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm

Directors stressed that structural transformation is crucial to raise potential growth in Togo, and
encouraged the authorities to accelerate implementation of reforms. Noting that improving
transport networks has been a principal component of the strategy to raise growth, they
recommended complementing this with enhancements in public investment management; the
opening to private sector competition of key economic sectors, such as mining,
telecommunications, and energy; and further improvements in the business environment.
Investing in social development will also be important in making growth inclusive.
Directors highlighted the need to produce national accounts and fiscal data in a more timely and
consistent manner, and welcomed the establishment of the national statistics institute.

KEY ISSUES
Economic context. Economic growth has remained strong in recent years, averaging 5.4
percent in 2013-14, on the back of productivity gains in the agricultural sector and
public investment in infrastructure. The pace of economic growth has contributed to
improving human development indicators, though poverty remains high. The fast pace
of public investment has laid the basis for higher growth but has also contributed to a
pronounced increase in public debt and current account deficit.
Outlook and risks. Under unchanged policies, output growth is expected to be
sustained over the medium term, but with accompanying current account and debt
pressures that are unlikely to abate. The risks to baseline forecasts are limited fiscal
consolidation, inaction in public financial management (PFM) reform, and delays in
reforms in mining, energy, telecommunications, and business environment, as well as a
sharp slowdown in regional or global growth.
Policies. Fiscal policy should be placed on a sustainable path while generating space for
social spending to make growth more inclusive. Private sector participation in key
economic sectors should be encouraged by improving the business environment.


Improve the domestic primary balance to reduce total public debt in the medium
term as debt has increased significantly in recent years. The improvement in fiscal
balances should ensure that the risk of external debt distress does not increase
beyond moderate level and the overall debt risk is reduced.



Complete implementation of key reforms to enhance fiscal governance in the areas
of revenue administration, PFM, and debt management.



Address financial sector weaknesses. Solve nonviable financial entities by
implementing least-cost resolution options.



Foster growth by enhancing the efficiency of investment, further improving the
business environment, and opening to private sector competition key economic
sectors.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND CONTEXT
1.
Economic growth has remained strong in recent years on the back of agricultural
production, the construction of the main road networks, and the expansion of the Port of
Lomé and the international airport. Output growth averaged 5.4 percent in 2013-14 (Text Table 1;
Figure 1). Investor uncertainty surrounding the presidential elections may have dampened economic
activity in the secondary and tertiary sectors in 2014 but it was compensated by the strong
performance in the

2014, and reductions in
retail fuel prices, reflecting global oil price trends (see SIP). The current account deficit widened from
7.5 percent of GDP in 2012 to 13 percent of GDP in 2013–14, primarily as a result of higher imports
of intermediary goods and petroleum products linked to the development of transportation
network. Exports failed to compensate the surge of imports in 2014, as equipment constraints
slowed down phosphate exploitation, and operational accidents and strikes interrupted the
production of clinker and cement (Figure 2).2 In addition, economic slowdown and large
depreciation in the currencies of key trading partners, such as Ghana and Nigeria, diminished the
demand for other Togolese exports.
2.
The recent pace of economic growth has contributed to improving human
development indicators. While real GDP per capita remains below the WAEMU average (Text
Figure 1), Togo’s human development index compares well with other WAEMU countries as well as
LICs and continues to improve (Text Figure 2). Togo has been making progress towards its
Millennium Development Goals (Text Table 2). However, poverty remains high and geographically
concentrated in rural areas.3 The challenge is thus to sustain growth while making it more inclusive.

The Ministry of Agriculture has developed a program (PNIASA) to increase the productivity of the agricultural and
cattle sectors, which includes the provision of fertilizers to producers.

3.
The fast pace of public investment has, however, contributed to a pronounced
increase in public debt and current account deficit. Public debt has accumulated very rapidly in
recent years, increasing from 46 percent of GDP in 2012 to 58 percent in 2014. Consequently,
investment spending and debt service have been putting considerable pressures on the budget and
liquidity situation.
4.
President Faure Gnassingbé was elected to a third term in April 2015 on a platform
centered on continuing to improve economic infrastructure to foster growth, expanding and
better targeting social spending, and maintaining security. On infrastructure, the authorities plan
to extend the road network beyond the main arteries, resurrect the railways for commercial
transport, and develop telecom services. The social program is extensive, spanning education, social
transfers, employment programs, health service expansion, universal access to potable water,
improved access to energy, and social housing. On the security front, the authorities intend to
strengthen the armed forces to play a more prominent role in regional stability.
5.
Progress in the implementation of the recommendations of the 2013 Article IV
consultations is mixed (Annex I). Togo was in the top 10 most improved performers in the 2015
ranking of Doing Business Indicators (DBI), mainly reflecting the establishment of a single window
for business registration. Revenue administration and PFM reforms are gathering momentum, but
debt management remains a weak area. The Treasury Single Account (TSA) is not yet in place, and

the re-organization of the Ministry of Finance has not started. Operational reforms in revenue
administration started in late 2014 and are beginning to contribute to increase in revenue. The
privatization program for the remaining two banks under government control has stalled.
Parliamentary and presidential elections in 2013 and 2015, respectively, may have played a role in
slowing reforms. Staff recommendations, hence, remain largely the same as in the 2013 Article IV
consultations.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
6.
Under unchanged policies, output growth is expected to be sustained in the medium
term, although current account and debt pressures are unlikely to abate, and the global
environment has deteriorated (Figure 3). Growth is expected to average 5½ percent in 2015–18,
supported by agricultural production, transportation services linked to international trade, and the
impact of investments in transport infrastructure, which should facilitate private economic activity.
The current account deficit is projected to improve marginally to 12¼ percent of GDP in 2015 as a
result of lower oil prices and narrow only to 9½ percent of GDP by 2020 with the gradual decline in
the fiscal deficit and increased savings of state-owned enterprises (SOEs).4 Inflation is expected to
remain subdued in line with WAEMU trend, with commodity price decline more than compensating
for U.S. dollar appreciation.5
7.
The risks to baseline forecasts are largely home-grown, although a sharp slowdown in
regional or global growth would inevitably have an impact (Annex II). Limited fiscal
consolidation would lead to further accumulation of public debt, and inaction in PFM would result in
less efficient spending and debt management. Delays in opening to private sector competition key
sectors, such as mining, energy, telecommunications, and in improving the business environment
would dampen medium-term growth prospects. A protracted slowdown in advanced and emerging
markets would affect Africa as a whole and in turn Togo, mainly through the impact on key trading
partners, such as Ghana and Nigeria. The impact would be moderate given Togo’s relatively
diversified country and product base for exports. Given Togo’s isolation from global financial
markets, the main channel of transmission of global shocks would be through imported food and oil
inflation, or through the price of Togo’s commodity exports. Further deterioration in the terms of
trade would dampen growth.
8.
Political risks hinge on the government’s capacity to deliver its promises of economic
growth, social spending, and job creation. The authorities’ task is complicated by mounting

SOEs (e.g. Port of Lomé, airport) have just concluded large investments to expand capacity. Thus, they are expected
to increase their revenue and savings. This will improve the private sector saving investment balance, as SOEs are
classified within the private sector.

In the absence of more developed financial markets, BCEAO’s monetary policy has a weak impact on inflation in the

population pressures, with large numbers of people expected to join the labor force. Such pressure
may generate an increasing level of social and political discontent. On the other hand, as the next
elections are not due until 2018, the government has the ideal window of opportunity to make good
on their promises of economic growth and social improvements.
Authorities’ views
9.
The Togolese authorities largely agreed with staff on the outlook and challenges but
are more optimistic about medium-term growth prospects and the current account deficit.
The authorities consider that economic growth will be above six percent over the medium-term as
the recent investments in infrastructure have laid the foundation for more private sector
participation in economic activity. In their view, agriculture will also continue to be an engine of
growth, benefiting from the government’s productivity enhancing programs. The authorities think
that the increase in the current account deficit is a temporary phenomenon. As these large
investments are soon to be completed, they expect the current account deficit to narrow faster than
in the staff’s projections.
10.
The authorities perceive a persistent appreciation of the U.S. dollar as the biggest risk,
because of its impact on debt service and the price of imports, particularly capital and intermediary
imports for infrastructure projects. In terms of risks to financial stability, the authorities consider the
microfinance sector as most vulnerable to adverse shocks. In their view, the resistance of interest
groups to reforms is unlikely to have an impact on growth, as ongoing improvements in the
business environment should promote economic activity. Finally, the authorities believe that the risk
of social unrest is minimal, as proven by the peaceful 2015 presidential election.

ADJUSTING THE FISCAL STANCE AND FOSTERING
LONG-TERM DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
A. Achieving Fiscal and Debt Sustainability
11.
Togo’s fiscal policy remained expansionary in recent years. Rapid increase in
domestically-financed investment has led to widening primary domestic deficits and debt
accumulation (Figure 4). The planned revenue increase to offset this sharp rise in capital spending
did not materialize as starting operations at the Revenue Authority (OTR) took longer than
anticipated. Current spending has, as a result, been reduced to the essential, with the exception of
the wage bill and oil price subsidies. On the financing side, privatization revenue shortfalls and cutbacks in donor budget support contributed to debt accumulation.
12.
Improved revenue performance is likely to partially reduce the deficit in 2015. Monthly
tax collections have been improving, particularly for domestic taxes, due to revenue administration
measures put in place by the OTR. Staff expects tax revenue to rise to 16.8 percent of GDP in 2015—
i.e., only a small shortfall compared to budget targets. If achieved, such collection would be a

TOGO

tangible increase in the tax-to-GDP ratio compared to the average collection of around 15.6 percent
during 2012-2014.
13.
The medium term budget outlook is constrained by the current expenditure policies.
Unresolved wage claims, due to piecemeal hiring and compensation decisions, are likely to continue
to exercise pressure on the wage bill. Although the authorities intended to keep the wage bill
constant in real terms, recent experience suggests that this may not be possible in the absence of a
review of remuneration policies. Lower global oil prices allowed the authorities to reduce fuel
subsidies. However, if the authorities do not pass through the projected higher oil prices in the
medium term, fuel price subsidies will continue to burden the budget (at ¾ percentage points of
GDP).6 In domestic capital spending, pre-financing contracts commit budgets to high levels of
outlays in the short to medium term7. The elevated, albeit declining, fiscal deficits, that would persist
under current policies would not suffice to eliminate budget financing gaps and allow only
moderate reductions in the public debt to GDP ratio and the current account deficit, and hence,
would not reduce Togo’s vulnerability to shocks.8

distress. Under the baseline scenario, all
external debt sustainability indicators are expected to remain below their indicative thresholds
throughout the projection period (2015–35). However, four out of the five indicators breach their
threshold under alternative scenarios and stress tests, highlighting the vulnerability of the Togolese
economy to various macroeconomic and financing shocks—in particular less favorable terms on new
6

The existing oil price adjustment formula was not applied consistently over 2011-14, giving rise to subsidies. While
the subsidy for gasoline and diesel has been low in 2015 due to low import prices, oil subsidies are expected to
return with rising international oil prices in the medium term, unless the authorities consistently apply the adjustment
formula.
7
With pre-financing contracts, the company winning the tender for a public project receives financing equivalent to
the full cost of the project upfront from a bank. The government then repays the bank, rather than the executing
company. These payments are recorded as investment spending in the budget as installments are paid. As with other
multi-year projects, pre-financing contracts entail executions spanning more than one budget year. Available fiscal
data do not include the value of current pre-financing contracts.

financing and lower revenue performance. Togo’s overall public debt dynamics present heightened
vulnerabilities, with the debt-to-GDP ratio remaining above the indicative benchmark for most of
the projection period.
15.
Public debt management in Togo is weak. 9 Public debt management functions are
scattered between several entities, which do not share information systematically. As a result, the
authorities lack a global overview of public debt and an assessment of its associated risks. The
fragmentation of debt management makes it impossible to design a Medium Term Debt Strategy
(MTDS) in line with good international practices. Furthermore, the authorities’ classification of public
debt stock does not include some debt instruments, such as Treasury bonds and some arrears.
16.
Staff stressed the need to reset fiscal balances on a sustainable path while generating
fiscal space for social spending. The risks of slipping into debt distress are now more elevated,
warranting fiscal adjustment. The authorities’ desire to increase potential growth in the presence of
rapid debt accumulation and current account pressures call for policies that strike the right balance.
In particular, staff recommended:


Anchoring public finances on a domestic primary balance that would gradually reduce the
public debt-GDP ratio. In the current context, debt sustainability could be appropriately
reinforced by moving to a 1.0 percent of GDP domestic primary surplus by 2020, up from a
projected deficit of 1.7 percent of GDP this year (Text Table 3 and Figure 5). On the revenue side,
pursuing such fiscal stance would entail accelerating reforms in revenue administration and
overhauling the pervasive exemption and tax expenditure system. On the expenditure side, in
the absence of a reform of the compensation system for public employees, the government
should exercise a much stricter control on the number of employees than in recent past,
ensuring that the wage bill declines in percent of GDP.10 Fuel price subsidies should be reduced
by consistently applying the existing price adjustment formula.11



Gradually redistribute allocations towards social spending. Staff emphasized that, with large
infrastructure projects mostly completed, there is an opportunity to reduce total allocation while
investing more in the social sector and secondary and feeder roads. It is essential to create fiscal
space to finance the new social spending initiatives proposed by the President to make growth
more inclusive.

9

Togo’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) rating remains weak at 3.0 for 2014, with a score of 3.2
for the economic management cluster. The World Bank’s Debt Management Performance Assessment (DeMPA) finds
that, for most indicators, debt management in Togo does not meet the minimum standards of effectiveness.
10

This would still allow wages to increase in line with inflation as well as wage drift.

11

Full elimination of price subsidies is advisable provided it does not lead to large increases in smuggling and loss in
tax base. Vulnerable segments of the population should be compensated. The current policy to subsidize kerosene,
largely used by the poor, should be continued.



Undertake projects that are fully integrated in all phases of the budget process. Investment
contracts should (i) follow the procurement process; (ii) be fully integrated in all phases of the
budget process; and (iii) require payments to the private sector after verification of completed
work. Pre-financed investments make it difficult to follow these PFM standards, as the
government’s payments to banks are on a fixed installment schedule, independent of the timing
of the completion of the contractors’ work.



Reorganize the Ministry of Finance. Essential elements of this reform would be the creation of
an effective debt management unit, a strengthened budget department encompassing budget
preparation, monitoring, and medium-term budget frameworks; and the establishment of a tax
policy unit. The Ministry of Finance, rather than the OTR, should define tax policy.



Strengthen debt management: (i) centralize all debt management functions in one entity;
(ii) organize the debt management unit into Front, Middle and Back Offices; (iii) build capacity
and train staff.

17.
The effect of these steps would be to stabilize and gradually reduce public debt from a
peak of 58 percent of GDP in 2014 to 55 percent by 2020. This would help avoid high debt
distress classification. Staff noted that Togo remains exposed to exchange rate risks since a
significant part of the external debt stock is denominated in foreign currencies other than the Euro.
Similarly, the increase in domestic debt, partly contracted in the WAEMU financial market and with
short maturities, due to increasing use of Treasury bills, exposes the economy to rollover and
refinancing risks. With a rapid rise in the stock of government securities on the regional market,
Togo has the highest level of domestic debt-to-GDP ratio within the WAEMU.

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TOGO

Authorities’ views
18.
The authorities reiterated their commitment to prudent fiscal policies. Their main
priority is to increase revenue by reducing exemptions and further enhancing tax administration.
Also, a project to simplify domestic taxation is likely to result in higher tax compliance. On the
expenditure side, they remain committed to applying the oil price adjustment mechanism, within the
constraints posed by pricing policies in the neighboring countries and the value of the naira and the
cedi.12 However, they noted that infrastructure gaps beyond the completed main roads will limit the
scope for increasing social sector investments in the short term. The authorities view pre-financing
as an innovative tool to accelerate public investment, when banks may not be willing to lend to
private companies performing public works. They also note that pre-financed projects currently
follow the three criteria proposed by staff, thus ensuring adherence to good PFM practices.
19.
The authorities did not perceive debt levels as posing risks to fiscal sustainability. In
particular, they do not see any risks associated with the rising debt levels as long as these remain
below the WAEMU convergence threshold of 70 percent of debt-to-GDP ratio.13 Furthermore, the
authorities do not consider the levels and dynamics of domestic debt as posing any liquidity or
rollover risks, given the high demand regional financial market players have so far shown for
Togolese government securities. They also consider that the baseline macroeconomic assumptions
underlying the DSA are too conservative, particularly those related to growth and current account
developments. They, however, agreed on the need to restructure and enhance the capacity of debt
management to enable it to effectively carry out its functions.

B. Strengthening Institutions to Foster Long-Term Fiscal Sustainability
20.
Following the establishment of the Revenue Authority (OTR), Customs and Internal
Revenue have undertaken a number of operational improvements, which resulted in good
revenue performance in early 2015. A new performance management and monitoring system is in
place, which includes performance indicators at the aggregate level and performance contracts for
each staff. Several important operational changes have also been put in place.14 Additional reforms
would allow segment taxpayers more efficiently and reduce opportunities for abuse.

12
Ceteris paribus, a depreciation of the cedi or naira versus the CFAF makes smuggling of gasoline from Ghana or
Nigeria more profitable.
13

Staff and the authorities discussed the differences between the WAEMU convergence criteria of debt-to-GDP ratio
and the sustainability indicators under the LIC-DSA framework. Specifically, the 70 percent debt-to-GDP ratio
criterion for WAEMU convergence is not directly comparable to the debt-to-GDP ratio used as a debt burden
indicator in the LIC-DSA. The former is measured in nominal terms, while the latter is measured in present value
terms. Also, apart from the debt-to-GDP ratio, assessment of debt sustainability under the LIC-DSA takes into
account other debt burden indicators, a country’s specific policy and institutional environment, and its countryspecific risks.
14

Revenues have been secured by collecting more payments via banks and transferring collections within 48 hours to
the Treasury account; a standardized VAT invoice is being gradually introduced; the single window is in place at the

21.
The authorities covered considerable ground by preparing or adopting the legal acts
to implement the comprehensive PFM reform plan approved in 2013.15 Final steps still need to
be taken for the actual implementation of some key reforms. WAEMU directives have been
transposed into local legislation. Procedures for the daily transfer of tax revenue to Treasury account
at the BCEAO have been put in place, and a Treasury Management Committee meets weekly.
Liquidity forecasts have improved but need to be more effective. Implementation of the TSA
remains uncertain. Some key reforms need to be implemented to check the rising liquidity and debt
risks, and to improve budget execution.
22.
Staff advised the authorities to focus on key measures to enhance fiscal governance.
Given political and capacity constraints, the team advised the authorities to prioritize simple but
essential reforms with maximum impact.


Leverage the OTR to modernize revenue administration. As a first step, the authorities
should appoint the OTR’s Board of Directors. Furthermore, each exemption should be backed up
by an agreement specifying the exempted goods, so that Internal Revenue and Customs can
perform ex-post verification.16 Ideally, the exemption regime should be replaced by a tax
reimbursement regime, which would mainstream ex-post verification. The current practice of
requesting immediate release of imports beyond customary goods should be prohibited and all
imported goods should be processed through the ASYCUDA system. The segmentation of
taxpayers should be based solely on company turnover.



Improve Treasury cash management and complete the establishment of the TSA.17

Authorities’ views
23.
The authorities agreed with the thrust of staff advice, and emphasized that capacity
shortfalls need to be supported by technical assistance. A specific challenge in revenue
administration is to find IT expertise to establish links between customs and internal revenue
systems—a must to reap synergies from the establishment of the OTR. PFM reforms, including the
Port; Sydonia World has replaced Sydonia++ since January; and committees to evaluate tax exemptions have been
established.
15

The reform plan spans fiscal reporting, the organization of the MEF, budget preparation and execution, cash
management, and treasury single account. It also includes a module on revenue administration reform.
16

Tax exemptions and tax expenditures are increasing and their lack of specificity is making ex-post controls difficult.
The various committees on exemptions, tax expenditures on projects, and industrial zones could usefully provide
recommendations on operational reforms to reduce revenue leakages.
17

Priorities for Treasury cash management are to (i) feed the Treasury Forecast model with quality data; (ii) establish
an operational process to regularly update the Treasury Plan; (iii) enact the decree committing line ministries to draft
an engagement plan. Priorities for TSA are to: (i) integrate the central administration entities in the TSA and finalize
the TSA at the level of the BCEAO; (ii) analyze the balance sheets of the other entities that are to join the TSA and
find solutions for those which will be found in deficit; (iii) sign and implement immediately the TSA’s Cashier
Agreements between the Treasury and the identified agent banks.

12

establishment of a TSA and the effective functioning of the Treasury cash management system,
remain priorities. The State Minister of Economy, Finance and Development Planning intends to
proceed with the reorganization of his ministry as soon as work for the 2016 budget is completed.18

ENHANCING FINANCIAL SECTOR DEVELOPMENT AND
STABILITY
A. Sector Description and Trends
24.
The financial sector, which is competitive with a significant presence of foreign banks,
faces a number of structural problems. Foreign banks account for 66 percent of the banking
system assets. (Text Figure 4). Financial depth has increased significantly over the past decade but
the degree of financial intermediation, measured by the loans’ term structure and their
diversification across sectors, remains limited. The banks credit portfolio serves mainly some large
and medium sized businesses involved in retail trade, public works, and transportation (Text Figure 5
and 6).

25.
Since December 2013, loans to companies performing public works (mainly roads)
have increased in the banking system portfolio. Large infrastructure projects have been receiving
an increasing share of the banking credit, substituting for other economic activities such as
manufacturing and transportation. This has been facilitated by a rapid increase in BCEAO financing

B. Financial Soundness
26.
While the overall financial system is sound, the financial condition of some banks has
weakened since 2013. As a result, solvency indicators and asset quality have worsened, and
profitability and liquidity have

establishment of new market participants, as well as a deceleration of economic activity in the
services sector in 2014.

C. Risk Assessment
27.
The recent WAEMU level consultation highlighted that Togo’s financial system is
among the most vulnerable in the region. Region-wide risk assessment analyses, including a
potential deterioration in credit risk or default of concentrated exposures, revealed that Togo’s
banking system would be among the most affected in the region.19 A large state-owned bank
continues to have difficulty respecting solvency ratios, constituting a fiscal risk. The provisional
administrator (PA), whose term ended at end-June 2015, made considerable effort to address the
financial weaknesses and governance issues. The general assembly of the bank approved a proposal
by the PA to recapitalize and improve the financial situation of the bank over a year. A second bank
under provisional administration since 2013 is a small private bank representing only 0.5 percent of
the banking system assets.
28.
The microfinance sector has greater reach in Togo than in other WAEMU countries,
but it is plagued by structural weaknesses and unregulated activity, representing a risk for
depositors and potentially for the government. Inadequate supervision, under-regulated entities,
and fraud threaten the sector. As of July 2015, about 100 out of 185 microfinance institutions
operated without license. The sector, which suffers from governance problems, weak information
systems and capacity, has experienced difficulties to adapt to the new regulatory framework and
deterioration in the credit portfolio. The three microfinance institutions under provisional
administration have showed little progress in their financial situation. The microfinance supervisor,
CAS-IMEC, a division of the MEF, is grossly understaffed and needs significant institutional
strengthening.
29.
Staff stressed the need for urgency in tackling the weaknesses evident in the financial
sector, including through:


Stricter enforcement of the current regulatory framework, including with regard to the
relatively lax single large exposure limit to reduce credit risk. Banks not properly capitalized
should be called to increase their capital to improve their ability to face shocks. Banks not

19

TOGO

respecting the regulatory minima should take immediate remediation action or be subject to
resolution.


Adopting the least-cost resolution option when dealing with nonviable financial entities to
limit the impact on the budget.



Strengthen the supervisory body for microfinance institutions and prepare a strategy to either
incorporate illegal decentralized financial institutions into the regulatory system or close them. A
decision should be taken regarding the institutions under provisional administration and those
facing financial difficulties, such as recapitalization or restructuring.

Authorities’ views
30.
The authorities hold a more positive view of recent developments and options for the
public bank facing financial difficulties. They perceive the results already achieved and the
measures put in place by the provisional administration as promising and are not considering
restructuring or selling the bank at its current state.
31.
The authorities agreed with the importance of addressing the weakness in the
microfinance sector. The authorities noted that actions are being taken to improve the solvency of
the banking and microfinance sectors, such as the March 2015 WAEMU directive that increases the
minimum capital requirement from CFAF 5 billion to CFAF 10 billion in the banking sector, and from
CFAF 1 billion to CFAF 3 billion in the microfinance sector.

PROMOTING STRUCTURAL TRANSFORMATION TO
RAISE GROWTH
32.
Growth in Togo has been weak and highly
volatile (see SIP). Most of Togo’s growth over the last
decades is attributable to labor accumulation, while
human capital accumulation remained low and total
factor productivity negative (Text Figure 11). This
emphasizes the importance of improving the efficiency
of factors of production mix in the economic system.

Staff noted that increasing public investment may not be sufficient to unlock growth.
Complementary policies are needed to achieve higher growth and sustainable debt. These include
improving the quality of public investment, crowding-in private investment, widening economic
space for small and medium enterprises and FDI, and boosting exports.
35.
Staff advised the authorities to look beyond physical investment to foster growth.
Main recommendations included:


Invest in investing. Improvements in public investment management can significantly enhance
its quality and economic growth.21



Open to more private sector competition key sectors with highest government presence
and intervention—mining, telecom, energy. Strong government presence may stifle
innovation, depress productivity, and raise costs.22 Arrears to utility companies should be settled
after verification.



Further improve the business environment. The specific Doing Business Indicators on which
Togo performs poorly (e.g., paying taxes, getting credit, land tenure) should be targeted for
improvement with a monitorable and highly publicized action plan.

of Public Investment Efficiency,” IMF Working Paper, 37.
21

One option discussed with the authorities is to diagnose priority areas of intervention in the investment cycle by
volunteering participation in the new Public Investment Management Assessment (PIMA) tool.
22

For example, Telecom services in Togo are among the most expensive in the world and their quality is low. The
power sector is inefficiently run and saddled by cross-arrears with all levels of government. Power cuts are
increasingly common.

Authorities’ views
36.
The authorities agreed with the thrust of staff advice and felt that more infrastructure
could be delivered by the public sector via public-private partnerships. In particular, the
authorities are aware that Togo’s chronic lack of energy is stifling growth and long-term solutions
are needed to increase domestic generation. In the medium term, the Adjarala dam project is
expected to provide more than half of Togo’s electricity imports. On mining, a new mining code
under finalization should lay the foundation for more development and foreign participation in the
sector.

EXTERNAL SUSTAINABILITY
37.
The large current account deficit poses a risk to external stability.23 24 This is related to
the relatively loose fiscal stance and high level of private and public investment. Togo’s current
account deficit has been mainly financed by

Even though Togo’s exports

concentrated in low value-added
products such as raw materials and reexports. Main exports are mining
products such as phosphate and clinker,
cash-crops with low transformation such
as cotton and cocoa, cement, and reexports (oil-related products, vehicles,

The EBA-lite exchange rate assessment includes three approaches. The current account (CA) model and the index
of the real exchange rate are panel regression-based analyses of the CA and real exchange rate, while the third
method, external sustainability (ES), is model-free and focused on sustainability analysis. Model-based methods
estimate for each country the CA norm or real exchange rate level based on a set of fundamentals and policies, and
compares it with the actual to derive the implicit change in the real exchange rate that would close the gaps. The ES
method assesses the sustainability of a country’s external position by comparing the CA expected to prevail in the
medium-term to the CA that would stabilize the external stock position at a specified benchmark level.

Staff recommendations:
40.
Pursuing a tighter fiscal stance is essential to contribute to a reduction in the current
account deficit and ensure long-term external stability. Fiscal consolidation would contribute to
eliminating external financing gaps and also attract additional financing, including from donors, as
confidence in debt and external sustainability increases.
41.
Togo should be prudent when borrowing in non-concessional terms. Borrowing plans
for investment should bear in mind medium and long-term debt sustainability. Increase the valueadded component of exports. Given the low value-added component of exports and the large
portion of the population employed in the agricultural sector, Togo should pursue the existing
efforts to increase the productivity in the sector (e.g. PNIASA) and implement an agro-industrial
development strategy. The strategy’s objective should focus on increasing productivity and gaining
participation in the global value-added chain, so that living standards of a large portion of the
population can be improved.
Authorities’ views
42.
The authorities consider that the recent large public investments in infrastructure will
foster economic development and growth. They view the large current account deficit mainly as

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

TOGO

the by-product of the temporary increase in public and private investment. They project a more
accelerated reduction in the current account than staff. They expect a faster pick-up in exports, in
particular of clinker and extracting industries, and contraction of imports related to roads
construction projects coming to an end. They do not think that the wider current account deficit is
linked in the short term to a possible overvaluation of the real exchange rate.
43.
The authorities noted that they remain vigilant in terms of their borrowing strategy.
To finance from domestic sources investments in infrastructure, they are relying on the WAEMU
bond market, where, in their view, there is ample appetite for Togolese bonds.
44.
The authorities agreed that improving the business climate is paramount to ensure
sustainable and inclusive growth. They plan to accelerate improvements in business environment.

DATA ISSUES
45.
The establishment in February 2015 of the National Statistics, Economic and
Demographic Studies Institute (INSEED) is a positive development. The institute constitutes a
positive step towards improving economic and demographic statistics in Togo.
46.
National accounts are finalized with a very long lag. National accounts for 2010 were
finalized in May 2015. Given limited resources, plans to build quarterly national accounts have been
cancelled to prioritize the preparation of 2011-15 national accounts, and work on the transition to
the System of National Accounts 2008.
47.
The Consumer Price Index covers only Lomé. The work on national consumer price index
has already started and its publication is scheduled for January 2016.
48.
In the fiscal area, data production is compartmentalized and not checked for
consistency across departments. The quarterly validation meetings of the TOFE reports have not
yet resulted in important improvements in quality, particularly in the areas of end-of-year operations
and accounting of arrears and payment delays. The budget preparation process is weakened by
limited information on execution during the year.
49.

Staff recommended greater emphasis on producing consistent and timely data for

informed decision-making.




20

National accounts: To reduce the lags in production of national accounts and improve the
production of preliminary GDP data, the authorities need to strengthen the staffing of the
INSEED.
New statistical initiatives. Projects currently undertaken by the INSEED such as clearing the
lags in national accounts by 2017, a household budget survey (Quibb) for 2015, a CPI with
national coverage, and the new economic activity indices on international trade and firm sales
should be finalized since they would contribute greatly to inform economic policy decisions.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TOGO

Consistency of fiscal data. A new Steering Committee (SC) should provide direction on priority
improvements (e.g., arrears) to technical staff. The budget projection for the following year
should be based on projection for budget execution in the current year.
Authorities’ views
50.
The authorities agreed with the importance of developing economic statistics and
strengthening statistical units with staffing and resources. However, they thought that
establishing a SC is not necessary, as the recently established TOFE Validation Committee is
gathering momentum.

STAFF APPRAISAL
51.
Economic growth in Togo has been strong reflecting productivity gains in the
agricultural sector and major transport infrastructure projects. The pace of economic growth
has contributed to improving human development indicators, though poverty remains high,
particularly in rural areas. The fast pace of public investment has laid the basis for higher growth but
has also contributed to a pronounced increase in public debt and current account deficit.
52.
To ensure debt and external sustainability, fiscal balances need to be placed on a
sustainable path, while generating fiscal space for social spending to make growth more
inclusive. Given Togo’s high debt vulnerability and low debt management capacity, the risks of
slipping into debt distress are now more elevated, warranting fiscal adjustment. In particular, public
finances need to be anchored on a domestic primary balance that would gradually reduce the public
debt-to-GDP ratio over the medium term.
53.
The authorities have made considerable effort in laying the ground for institutional
reforms, and they should now complete the implementation of key reforms. Essential reforms
with maximum impact would include (i) reorganization of the Ministry of Finance, in particular to
improve debt management, strengthen budget preparation and monitoring, develop medium-term
budget frameworks, and design tax policy; (ii) developing an effective Treasury cash management;
and (iii) establishing a Treasury Single Account. Following the establishment of the OTR, the reforms
in revenue administration have resulted in improvement in revenue performance. OTR should be
leveraged to fully modernize revenue administration.
54.
There is need to enforce the regulatory framework in the financial sector, solve
problem banks, and strengthen supervision in the microfinance sector. While the overall
financial system is sound, the financial condition of some banks has weakened in recent years. Banks
not respecting the regulatory indicators should take immediate corrective action or be subject to
resolution. The authorities should implement least-cost resolution options when dealing with
nonviable financial entities. There is also need to strengthen supervision in the microfinance sector,
which is plagued by structural weaknesses and unregulated activity.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

21

TOGO

55.
Structural transformation will help raise potential growth in Togo. Improving transport
networks has been a principal component of the government’s strategy to raise growth. This
strategy should be complemented by improvements in public investment management; opening to
private sector competition key economic sectors, such as mining, telecom, and energy; and further
improvements in the business environment.
56.
For informed decision-making, national accounts and fiscal data need to be produced
in a more timely and consistent manner. In this respect, the recent establishment of the national
statistics institute (INSEED) is a welcome development. The new projects undertaken by INSEED on
national accounts, CPI, and economic activity indices should be finalized, and its staffing should be
strengthened. In the fiscal area, data production would benefit from a more formal budget
execution monitoring exercise and communication across departments for consistency.
57.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard 12–
month cycle.

Annex I. Authorities Response to Main Recommendations from
the 2013 Article IV Consultations
Main Recommendations
Staff emphasized the following areas as
key to maintain macroeconomic stability
and promote inclusive growth:

Authorities Response
The authorities noted that they took the following steps:

Improve debt management by seeking
financing on terms consistent with debt
sustainability and further reducing the fiscal
deficit in the medium term.

An effort was made to mobilize financing from WAEMU and
from concessional loans. Togo has not had access to
international markets.

Free budget space for social and
infrastructure spending to support
implementation of policies that raise incomes
of the poor, such as rural feeder roads, mini
dams for irrigation, and off-grid energy
alternatives.

Significant investments have been made to narrow the
infrastructure gap that had developed over more than 15
years of socio-political crisis. Several rural roads were
completed and a program of village electrification with solar
panels or grid extension started. Funds allocated for minidams could not be used because feasibility studies could not
be completed.
Fuel subsidies have been virtually eliminated by January 2015.
The government took temporary social protection measures
towards the most disadvantaged groups when retail fuel
prices where increased in 2011.
The negotiations surrounding the 2013 Public Service Statute
established expectations of large increases in wages and
remuneration. So far, these have been resisted as they would
not be compatible with budget equilibrium. But pressure from
trade unions is strong.
In the context of the 2013 PFM reform plan, the WAEMU
directives have been transposed in local legislation; their
implementation is progressing; the OTR has been established;
and the Computerised System for Public Financial
Management (SIGFIP) is being enhanced.
The provisional administration is improving the financial
condition of a large state-owned bank. A strategy is being
developed for the future of the public banks BTCI and UTB.

Progressively reduce poorly-targeted fuel
subsidies, while broadening and improving
social safety nets, and lower growth of public
sector wages.

Implement long-planned PFM and revenue
administration reforms.

Intensify financial sector oversight and solve
problem banks. Put in place stronger
supervision of microfinance.

In microfinance, several funds to promote financial inclusion
for targeted groups were created by the Ministry of Grassroots
Development. The government intends to remove the license

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

35

TOGO

Reform the phosphate, telecommunication
and energy sectors, where state-owned
enterprises dominate. The World Bank plays a
key support role in this area.

Improve the business environment.
Retain as top policy priorities poverty
reduction, agricultural productivity and
employment.

from bankrupt microfinance institutions and ban activities of
institutions operating without a license.
Substantial investments were made to rehabilitate the
production equipment in the phosphate company.
The World Bank is assisting the government with a project to
initiate reforms that will open the telecom sector to more
private sector competition.
The energy issue has an important regional dimension. The
presence in Togo of the independent power producer Contour
Global resulted in less power cuts. In the long term, the
hydroelectric dam Adjarala should alleviate the demand gap.
In 2015, Togo moved from 164th to 142nd rank in Doing
Business Indicators. More remains to be done.
Targeted microfinance funds are contributing to lift people out
of poverty. Agricultural productivity is improving through the
PNIASA project (World Bank) and the agricultural
mechanization program initiated by the government.

Togo is relatively isolated from
global financial markets as the
main sources of financing are
official funding, concessional
loans, and borrowing on the
WAEMU bond market.
Strengthening of the U.S. dollar
would increase external debt
servicing costs and import
prices of capital and
intermediate goods, resulting in
larger costs for public works
and enterprises. The main
impact would be on inflation.
A sharp growth slowdown and
large fiscal and financial losses
in China may translate into
lower availability of external
funding for infrastructure
projects.
Policy slippages may materialize
to accommodate increases in
infrastructure investment or
public sector wages and
employment, resulting in an
increase in debt.
Financial sector soundness
indicators have deteriorated.
Also, some microfinance
institutions are in a weak
financial position. Both factors
pose fiscal risks.

Monitor the debt level

Adjust fiscal balance and
implement competitivenessenhancing structural reforms
to improve long-term external
sustainability.

Prioritize investment projects.

No adequate policy response
exists to delays in fiscal
consolidation. A second-best
option is to reduce spending
in other areas and accelerate
revenue raising measures.
Apply existing prudential rules
and limit regulatory
forbearance. Regulate
microfinance institutions.

The main channel of
transmission would be through
the impact on key trading
partners such as Ghana and
Nigeria. The effect would be
moderate given that Togo’s
exports are well diversified by
product and destination.
Reforms reducing the control of
entrenched groups are likely to
meet strong resistance. Reform
delays would slow growth,
increase inequality, and
potentially lead to pressure for
political change.

Adjust fiscal balance and
implement competitivenessenhancing structural reforms
to improve long-term external
sustainability.

Planning and regulatory
inaction and poor management
of utilities may lead to
widespread power cuts. In the
short term, this will result in
budget costs. In the long-term,
power shortages may constrain
economic growth.
Not reaching out to the
opposition may lead to social
unrest, although public order
and security are well
established.

Invest in power generation
capacity and reform pricing
policies to promote private
sector participation in the
sector. Public administrations
should pay their bills to avoid
accumulation of arrears.

Flooding and drought are
recurring events, but their
impact is typically short-lived
and/or localized.

Accelerate reforms in all areas.
Liberalize
markets
and
continue to improve business
environment.

Increase allocations for
targeted social spending.
Reach consensus with unions
to achieve balanced solutions,
both with private and public
sectors.
Implement disaster mitigation
programs, with financial and
technical support from
donors.

¹ Assistance committed under the original framework is expressed in net present value (NPV) terms at the
completion point, and assistance committed under the enhanced framework is expressed in NPV terms at the
decision point. Hence these two amounts cannot be added.
² Under the enhanced framework, an additional disbursement is made at the completion point corresponding to
interest income earned on the amount committed at the decision point but not disbursed during the interim
period.

Safeguards Assessments
The Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) is a common central bank of the countries of the
West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU). The 2013 assessment of the BCEAO was
completed on December 13, 2013. The assessment found that the bank continued to have a strong
control environment and has, with the implementation of the 2010 Institutional Reform of the
WAEMU, enhanced its governance framework. Specifically, an audit committee was established to
oversee the audit and financial reporting processes, and transparency has increased with more
timely publication of the audited financial statements. The assessment also identified some
limitations in the external audit process and recommended that steps be taken to ensure the
adequacy of the mechanism through selection of a second experienced audit firm to conduct joint
audits.

Exchange Arrangement
Togo, a member of the WAEMU, accepted the obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2, 3 and 4 of
the Fund’s Articles of Agreement as of June 1, 1996, and maintains an exchange system free of
restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions. The
WAEMU’s exchange regime is a conventional peg to the euro.
The union's common currency, the CFA franc, had been pegged to the French franc at the rate of
CFAF 1 = F 0.02. Effective January 12, 1994, the CFA franc was devalued and the new parity set at
CFAF 1 = F 0.01. Effective December 31, 1998, the parity was switched to the euro at a rate of
CFAF 655.96 = €1.
Aspects of the exchange system were also discussed in the report “WAEMU: Common Policies for
Member Countries” (Country Report No. 14/84).

JOINT WORLD BANK-IMF WORK PROGRAM, 2015–16
The IMF Togo team led by Ms. Sancak (mission chief) held a discussion with the World Bank Togo
team led by Mr. MacWilliam (mission chief) on August 12, 2015, to identify macro-critical structural
reforms and coordinate the two teams’ work for the period September 2015-December 2016.
Continuous collaboration is taking place, including coordination of timing of missions.
The teams agreed that Togo’s work program should focus on policies and structural reforms to
promote sustainable growth through structural transformation and to maintain macroeconomic and
financial stability. In this regard, there would be need to reset fiscal policy to ensure fiscal and
external sustainability, enhance public financial management, strengthen financial sector stability,
and promote financial development. To increase potential growth there is also a need to implement
reforms in other key areas such as energy and telecommunications, and to continue improving the
business climate and the efficiency of public investment projects. Areas of close collaboration
between the Fund and the Bank include the financial sector, debt policy, and poverty analytics and
policies. Details on division of labor in other areas are presented below.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance, but weaknesses in the quality and
timeliness of data hamper staff’s analysis.


National accounts: are compiled based on very limited information, with only few surveys and
scarce data on primary agriculture and private sector services. National accounts are published
with considerable delays and are only available on annual frequency. Base year for constant
price GDP is 2007.



Price statistics: Base year for CPI index is 2008, with coverage of only the capital city.



Fiscal sector statistics: Government finance statistics are derived from a weak accounting and
reporting system. There are often large discrepancies between the transactions that yield net
lending/borrowing and its financing, and large inconsistencies between stock and flow data.
Also, there are significant delays in compilation and dissemination, and limited or no data on
public entities outside of (budgetary) central government.



Balance of payments statistics: Data are reported on an annual frequency with long lags. Data
corresponding to 2012 were published in February 2015, and the balance of payments data for
2013 were published in June 2015.



Monetary data: are reported by the BCEAO and sent to AFR within 45 days.

2.
The country has participated in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) since
November 2001. Metadata on the national statistical system, including plans for improvement
posted to the Fund’s Dissemination Standard Bulletin Board, were last updated in December 2004.
National accounts and consumer price index (CPI)
3.
Like other West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) member states, Togo
embarked in late 2002 on implementing the System of National Accounts 1993 (1993 SNA), using
the ERETES software. The national accounts for the new base year (2007) were completed in 2012. In
2013 the Direction Générale de la Statistique et de la Comptabilité Nationale (DGSCN) published the
National Accounts GDP numbers covering the period 2000-2007. Respectively, in 2014 and 2015 the
2009 and 2010 National Accounts GDP numbers were finalized and published. The national statistics
institute, INSEED (Institut National de la Statistique et des Etudes Economiques et Démographiques),
established in February 2015, is currently executing a plan, with the support of AFRITAC West, to
clear the delay in the elaboration of National Accounts corresponding to the period 2011–15 by
2017. Given that limited resources are available plans to build quarterly NA have been cancelled to
prioritize the work on closing the delays in the publication of National Accounts, and on the
transition of National Accounts to SNA 2008.

4.
The CPI basket was revised in 2010. The WAEMU commission, supported by AFRISTAT and
the BCEAO, launched a revision of the harmonized CPI basket in the region in 2008. The reform
included expanding CPI surveys, and updating the weights of various sub-components to reflect
consumption habits. In line with WAEMU directives the INSEED is constructing a consumer price
index with national coverage. The collection of the first observations started in January 2015, and
the index will be published in January 2016 when the first 12 month variation becomes available.
External sector statistics
5.
Balance of payments statistics and international investment position data are compiled
based on bank reports, a survey of enterprises, and customs data. Statistics are compiled following
the principles of the 6th balance of payment manual. The Central bank continues its efforts for a
better coverage of informal trade notably with the sub-regional unit for the reconciliation of intraWAMU trade.
Government accounts and public debt data
6.
The Government finance statistics are compiled by the Ministry of State from customs, tax,
and treasury departments and consolidated in the form of government financial operations tables
(TOFE). The new WAEMU budget nomenclature now permits the economic and ministerial
classification of expenditure, with functional classification under development. The monthly TOFE is
based on a mixture of administrative and accounting data and is sent to AFR with a two-month lag.
The debt database weakened since the HIPC completion point at end 2010. Government recognition
of old domestic arrears and their liabilities has further complicated the compilation of a reliable and
consistent database. Only budgetary central government data are reported for publication in the
Government Finances Statistics Yearbook (GFSY), government finance high frequency data are not
reported for publication in the IFS. In the context of the 2013 Article IV consultation, with assistance
from STA, the authorities established a bridge table allowing transposition of TOFE data, which is
based on the 1986 Government Finance Statistics Manual (GFS86), to the 2001 Government Finance
Statistics Manual (GFSM01). An updated table on Government Financial Operations for 2011-20
based on GFSM01 principles is presented in Appendix III.
Monetary statistics
7.
Monthly data for Togo, along with data for other members of the West African Monetary
Union are regularly disseminated by the Central Bank of the West African Monetary Union (BCEAO)
with a lag of about two months. Data on lending and borrowing rates, charged by domestic banks,
are compiled and available monthly.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Approved By
Abebe Aemro Selassie
(IMF) and John Panzer
(WB)

Prepared by the International Monetary Fund and the
World Bank

Togo remains at a moderate risk of debt distress based on an assessment of public
external debt, but at a heightened overall risk of debt distress, reflecting significant
vulnerabilities related to domestic debt. After full HIPC assistance, MDRI and beyond debt
relief, Togo’s external and public debt indicators improved significantly in 2010/11. Since then,
Togo has contracted significant external and domestic debt. While external debt indicators are
projected to remain below the policy-relevant indicative thresholds under the baseline scenario,
Togo remains vulnerable to shocks and could breach the thresholds for the present value (PV) of
external debt-to-GDP, the PV of external debt-to-revenue, and the debt service-to-revenue ratios
under alternative scenarios and stress tests. Togo’s overall public debt dynamics also highlight
heightened vulnerabilities, with the debt-to-GDP ratio remaining above the indicative
benchmark for most of the projection period. The debt sustainability analysis results suggest that
there is limited space for higher fiscal deficit if the moderate risk rating is to be preserved or
improved. They also highlight a need to enhance the capacity of debt management.

TOGO

INTRODUCTION
1.

The debt sustainability analysis (DSA) of Togo’s public debt was prepared jointly by the

International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank.1 It updates the 2013 DSA (IMF Country Report
No. 14/38), based on the most recent external debt data from the authorities and the macroeconomic
framework derived from the 2015 IMF Article IV consultation. Data are composed of external and domestic
debt of the central government, as well as debt and guaranteed debt of public enterprises.
2.

Togo’s public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) external debt is CFAF 614 billion at end-2014

while its composition has considerably changed since 2010 (Text Table 1). Togo reached the
completion point of the HIPC Initiative in December 2010 and was granted debt relief from several
multilateral and bilateral creditors. As a result, the ratio of PPG external debt to GDP dropped from
53.9 percent in 2009 to 19.9 percent in 2010. Since then, external debt stock has increased, reaching
26.9 percent of GDP at end-2014. Around 51 percent of this stock of debt is owed to multilateral creditors
and the remainder to bilateral and commercial creditors. Between 2010 and 2014, central government
borrowing from commercial banks has increased significantly, from around CFAF 31 billion to
CFAF 201 billion. The debt from commercial banks is typically contracted at less favorable terms than from
other creditors. Thus, the increase in the share of commercial bank borrowing to total borrowing from 10.1
percent in 2010 to 32.7 percent in 2014 has created additional pressure on Togo’s external debt position.
3.

Public domestic debt has increased in recent years, amounting CFAF 717 billion at end-2014

from CFAF 473 billion at end-2010. After declining in 2011 by about 1½ percentage points to
28½ percent of GDP, the level of domestic debt has gradually increased to 31½ percent in 2014. A key
driver to the increase in domestic debt has been the rise in recourse to the regional financial market, which
has more than offset the decrease in domestic arrears. The stock of government securities on the regional
market has increased from 9.2 percent of GDP in 2010 to 18.4 percent in 2014, with an increasing use of
Treasury bills. Consequently, Togo had the highest level of domestic debt-to-GDP ratio within the WAEMU
region at end-2014.2

BASELINE ASSUMPTIONS
4.

The baseline macroeconomic assumptions for the present DSA are the following:
a.

Real GDP growth is estimated at 5.4 percent in 2014 and would average about 5½ percent over
2015–18, supported by agricultural production, transportation services linked to international
trade, and the impact of investments in transport infrastructure. In the long run, real GDP growth
is estimated to settle down at 4.5 percent. The estimated potential growth rate exceeds historical
rates, which were depressed by the dislocations caused by the protracted social, political, and
economic crisis that the country experienced up to the mid-2000s. The main downside risks to
growth projections are related to the country’s weak public financial management capacity and
resistance to reform by entrenched groups. These may lower the efficiency of the planned public
investments, which, together with private sector growth and investment, would be one of the
drivers of growth over the medium term. Additionally, a binding constraint is the availability of
reliable electricity supply, given that the growth of demand outstrips that of supply and that there
are no obvious economical short-term solutions.

b.

Public investment is projected to increase to 9.7 percent of GDP in 2015, continuing the upward
trend of the recent past (8.3 percent in 2013 and 9.1 percent in 2014). Public investment is
expected to stabilize in the medium term, at around 9.1 percent of GDP. About 50 percent of
public investments will be financed domestically while the remaining will be via external financing.
Public investment projects are expected to be mostly directed to infrastructure, with increasing

TOGO

portions dedicated to social spending, and, together with prudent fiscal policy and structural
reforms, would lead GDP growth to increase above its long-term trend for these years.
c.

The projections for key commodity prices (oil, cotton, cocoa, and coffee) through 2020 are based
on WEO projections of August 2015 and are assumed constant in real terms afterwards.

d.

Inflation was low in 2014 (0.2 percent) and is projected to increase in the medium term, reaching
2.5 percent in 2017 remaining stable afterwards, reflecting sound monetary policy at the regional
level.

e.

The current account balance has strongly deteriorated in 2013 and 2014 (respectively -13.0 and
-12.8 percent of GDP). The deficit is expected to remain at levels around 11 percent in the
medium term, before converging back to below 10 percent in the long run. The underlying
reasons for the recent deterioration of the current account balance are the large increase of
imports in 2013, in particular intermediary goods and oil imports, and the relative
underperformance of exports.

f.

The domestic primary fiscal balance is projected to improve marginally to -1.7 percent of GDP in
2015 compared to -1.8 percent in 2013. The projections for the long term point to a steady
improvement of the domestic primary fiscal balance as it reaches -0.3 percent in 2020.3

g.

The overall fiscal balance is programmed to decline from -6.4 in 2014 to -5.4 percent in 2015 and
to gradually revert back to around -5 percent, reflecting lower infrastructure investment needs in
the medium to long term.

h.

FDI flows are expected to stay stable over the medium-term at around 5 percent of GDP.
However, given Togo’s weak track record in governance, these flows, as well as grants, are subject
to significant risks, which may, as a result, hinder the favorable debt dynamics.

i.

Initially, all new external financing is expected to be received at concessional terms. As Togo
develops, concessional financing will become more scarce leading to a decrease in the grant
element of new financing after 2018 (as shown in Figure 1). It is assumed that non-concessional

payments and multi-year infrastructure investment plans.

4

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TOGO

new borrowing will amount to 1.5 percent of GDP in 2018 and gradually increase to 2.5 percent of
GDP in 2035. The sources of concessional external financing are expected to consist of Togo’s
traditional multilateral donors, as well as the recently-increased financing from non-Paris Club
creditors (especially China and India), which are generally less concessional in nature.

EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Baseline
5.

Under the baseline scenario, Togo’s external debt indicators remain below their indicative

policy-relevant thresholds (Table 1a, Figure 1).4 The present value (PV) of public and publicly
guaranteed (PPG) debt is projected at 19 percent of GDP in 2015 and remains below the 30 percent
threshold until the end of the projection period. Furthermore, both the PV of external debt relative to
revenues and exports stay relatively stable and below their respective indicative threshold until 2035. The
share of concessional loans in new financing is projected to decline, which results in the concessionality of
new loans to decrease from nearly 50 percent to around 23 percent over the period 2015 to 2035. The rate
of debt accumulation is projected to increase from 0.9 to 1.8 percent in the same period.
Alternative Scenarios and Stress Tests
6.

Togo’s external debt outlook remains vulnerable to shocks especially toward the end of the

projection period (Table 1b, Figure 1). The policy thresholds for four key ratios are breached under
alternative scenarios and stress tests. First, the PV of external debt to GDP ratio deteriorates under the
scenario in which new loans are obtained on less favorable terms. In this case, the threshold is breached in
2022. Second, under the same scenario of less favorable terms, the PV of debt-to-revenue ratio breaches
the 200 percent threshold in 2028. Further, the PV of debt service-to-revenue ratio surpasses the indicative
thresholds at the end of the period under a combination of shocks on growth, exports, value of currency
and non-debt creating flows. Finally, under the historical scenario, the three ratios above and the PV of
debt-to-exports ratio breach their thresholds, although the latter is less relevant for Togo, which is a
member of a currency union.
4

Togo’s quality of policies and institutions, as measured by the average World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional
Assessment (CPIA) for the period 2011–13 (2.98), places it as a “weak performer”. The corresponding indicative
thresholds for the external debt indicators are 30 percent for the NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio, 100 percent of the debtto-exports ratio, 200 percent for NPV of debt-to-revenue ratio, 15 percent for the debt service-to-exports ratio, and
18 percent for the debt service-to-revenue ratio. The corresponding indicative benchmark for total public debt to
GDP ratio is 38 percent.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TOGO

7.

In light of the results from the baseline and alternative scenarios as well as the stress tests,

staff concludes that Togo remains at moderate risk of external debt distress.

PUBLIC SECTOR DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
8.

The inclusion of Togo’s domestic public debt in the analysis emphasizes the vulnerability of

the baseline scenario (Table 2a, Figure 2). Togo’s domestic debt burden reflects persistently high deficits,
recognition as debt of accumulated liabilities, and weak public financial management, including very
limited debt management capacity. The increase in domestic debt stemmed in particular from the
government’s recognition of liabilities arising from liquidated loss-making SOEs and increasing use of
domestic borrowing to finance the budget.
Baseline scenario
9.

Under the baseline scenario, indicators of overall public debt burden (external plus

domestic) show significant vulnerabilities. The PV of public debt to GDP breaches the benchmark level
of 38 percent—above which the risk of debt distress is assumed to be heightened for countries with a low
CPIA score—for most of the forecast period (Figure 2).5 The PV of debt-to-revenue ratio is projected to
decline gradually into the long term, although its values are higher than in the previous DSA. The PV of
debt service-to revenue ratio tends to increase over time. While the trend is similar to the previous DSA, the
level is higher, reflecting increasing debt service vulnerabilities to variations in fiscal revenues.
Alternative Scenarios and Stress Tests
10.

The evolution of the debt indicators would be highly sensitive to non-debt flows shocks and

real depreciation shocks, which would increase the debt level and debt service over the long run.
Total public debt dynamics are particularly vulnerable to both non-debt flows and real depreciation
shocks6, highlighting the need to strengthen Togo’s external public debt (Table 2b, Figure 2). In addition,
under the assumption of constant primary balance (i.e., assuming no fiscal adjustment), public debt ratios
would increase steadily during the projection period, stressing the need for the authorities to improve the
5

The public debt benchmark was introduced in the DSA framework in the 2013 review of the Debt Sustainability
Framework. Similar to the thresholds for PPG external debt, this benchmark varies depending on a country’s CPIA
score and designates levels above which the risk of public debt distress is heightened.
6

The non-debt-creating flows shock is a one-time increase in other debt-creating flows amounting to 10 percent of
GDP in the second year of the projection period. The real depreciation shock is a one-time 30 percent nominal
depreciation of the domestic currency in the first year of the projection period.

TOGO

balance in the near future. For debt ratios to remain at a reasonable level over the long-run, an
improvement in the macroeconomic outlook, a decrease of fiscal deficits, and a more cautious debt
strategy are critical factors.

CONCLUSION
11.

Togo remains at a moderate risk of external public debt distress but has a heightened risk of

overall public debt distress, reflecting vulnerabilities in domestic debt. Under the baseline scenario, all
external debt sustainability indicators are expected to remain below their indicative thresholds throughout
the projection period (2015–35). However, four out of the five indicators breach their threshold under
alternative scenarios and stress tests. Togo’s overall public debt dynamics present heightened
vulnerabilities, with the debt-to-GDP ratio remaining above the indicative benchmark for most of the
projection period. These dynamics highlight the vulnerability of the Togolese economy to macroeconomic
and financing shocks (in particular less favorable terms on new financing and lower revenue performance),
and stress the need for a prudent approach to new borrowing. This also underlines the importance of
improving debt management capacity in Togo to have a realistic assessment of the risks posed by various
sectors.
12.

Maintaining a robust external and public debt outlook will depend on a sustained

improvement in macroeconomic performance, as well as prudent debt management and solid fiscal
performance. While public investment is expected to lead to sustained growth if coupled with reforms
facilitating private sector investment and growth, Togo’s weak public investment management capacity
may impose risks on the underlying public investment-growth nexus. In this context, it is essential that the
Togolese authorities ensure efforts to strengthen public financial management and debt management,
restructure the banking system and promote financial development, reform state-owned enterprises, and
improve the investment climate, hence laying the foundation for accelerating growth prospects.
13.

There are downside risks and a caveat to this conclusion. First, given that growth projections

are predicated on high public investment and good fiscal and debt management, delays in structural
reforms to enhance expenditure efficiency and the monitoring of debt, and limited fiscal consolidation
could dampen these prospects. Second, given Togo’s exposure international economic developments,
uncertainty in the availability of external financing, especially from non-traditional donors, could hamper
the country’s financing strategies. Lastly, a caveat to this analysis is the availability and quality of data, an
area in which Togo could benefit from enhanced capacity development.

The authorities have a different perspective on Togo’s debt sustainability risks. In particular,

they do not see any risks associated with rising debt levels as long as they are below the WAEMU threshold
of 70 percent (compared to 58 percent as at end-2014).7 Furthermore, the authorities do not consider the
levels and dynamics of domestic debt as posing any liquidity or rollover risks, given the high demand for
Togolese government securities so far shown by the regional financial market players. The authorities also
consider that the baseline macroeconomic assumptions underlying this DSA are too conservative,
particularly those related to growth and external current account developments. They, however, agreed on
the need to restructure and enhance the capacity of debt management to enable it to effectively carry out
its functions.

7

Staff and the authorities discussed the differences between the WAEMU convergence criterion of debt-to-GDP ratio
and the sustainability indicators under the LIC-DSA framework. Specifically, the 70 percent debt-to-GDP ratio
criterion for WAEMU convergence is not directly comparable to the debt-to-GDP ratio debt burden indicator in the
LIC-DSA. The former is measured in nominal terms, while the latter is measured in present value terms. Also, apart
from the debt-to-GDP ratio, assessment of debt sustainability under the LIC-DSA takes into account other debt
burden indicators, such as debt-to-revenue and debt-to-exports ratios, a country’s specific policy and institutional
environment, and country-specific risks.

Statement by Mr. Yambaye, Executive Director for Togo
and Mrs. Boukpessi, Advisor to the Executive Director
October 26, 2015

1.
The Togolese authorities are appreciative of the constructive engagement with the
Fund. They thank staff for the candid and productive dialogue during the 2015 Article IV
consultation, which will guide them in the implementation of their macroeconomic policy
and development agenda. They also thank Executive Directors and Management for their
continued support and guidance.
2.
The action plan of the new government appointed following the presidential elections
held in April 2015, approved by the Parliament in June 2015 is centered on four main fronts:
(i) making economic and social inclusion the first vector of national cohesion; (ii)
continuing modernizing the country through the deepening of economic reforms and the
intensification of major infrastructure projects; (iii) giving a new dynamic to the agenda of
political reforms with particular emphasis on decentralization and (iv) capitalizing on the
gains of reforms undertaken in the recent past to enhance Togo’s economic position in the
sub-regional and international environment.
3.
The authorities are broadly in agreement with staff’s assessment of the Togolese
economy, although with a less pessimistic view regarding the outlook and risks. They have
conveyed their continued commitment to strong macroeconomic management, as well as to
restoring macroeconomic stability and promoting inclusive growth.
Recent Economic Developments
4.
Economic growth has remained strong in recent years. Real GDP growth, estimated at
5.4 percent in 2013-14, is projected to remain stable in 2015 and to reach 5.6 percent in
2016 thanks to solid performance in the primary and tertiary sectors of the economy.
5.
Indeed, economic activity in 2014 was supported by the recovery of agricultural
production, which benefited from good rainfall and an increased use of fertilizers, in the
context of the Programme National d’Investissement Agricole et de Sécurité Alimentaire
(PNIASA). This program developed by the Ministry of Agriculture and launched in 2011
aims to increase the productivity of the agricultural sector by providing, among others,
fertilizers to producers. The improvement of the agricultural sector through the
implementation of the PNIASA has enabled Togo to be among the 38 countries pointed
out by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO).
6.
Investments undertaken especially in the context of the extension of the Port of Lomé,
the international airport, the completion of major road infrastructures as well as investments
in a clinker and cement plant were also main contributors to the strong growth recorded.

2
7.
Inflation was low and stood at 0.2 percent in 2014 (1.8 percent in 2013, 1.9 percent in
2015), in the context of declining food prices and lower retail fuel prices reflecting the
global oil price trends. The balance of payments came under pressure, reflecting a widening
of the current account deficit from 7.5 percent of GDP in 2012 to 12.8 percent in 2014.
Medium-term outlook and policies
8.
The medium-term outlook remains positive, with staff’s growth projection at around
5.6 percent in 2016-18, while the Togolese authorities consider that economic growth will
be above 6 percent over the medium-term. The authorities’ optimistic projection is based on
the fact that the extension of the Port of Lomé and capabilities of the international airport as
well as investments in infrastructure are expected to give a strong boost to private sector
activities. Moreover the pursuit of the agricultural reforms together with the new industrial
complex - ScanTogo mines- should also help expand economic activity and spur growth.
9.
Cognizant of the socio-economic challenges facing Togo, in particular the increase in
population and labor force, the authorities will continue their determined efforts to
strengthen macroeconomic performance as well as restoring stability and promoting
inclusive growth. In this context, efforts will also focus on further strengthening economic
and social institutions, as described in the presidential program for national development –
Togo Vision 2030.
Fiscal and debt management policies
10. Fiscal policy remains in line with the authorities’ objectives to increase domestic
revenue mobilization while containing current spending. In this regard, the 2015 budget was
revised earlier this month and is better aligned with execution capacity and takes into account
adjustments in the wage bill, shortfall in budgetary support and other adjustments. The
authorities agree that they need to enhance their efforts aimed at strengthening fiscal policy
and pursuing fiscal reforms in order to generate fiscal space for the much-needed social
spending.
11. On the revenue side, while revenue to GDP in 2015 is now projected to be lower than
budgetary estimates, it will still be higher than in 2014. The improvement in revenue is the
result of revenue administration measures put in place by the Office Togolais des Recettes
(OTR). The authorities will pursue efforts aimed at reducing tax exemptions, streamlining
tax policies and modernizing the revenue administration. Regarding expenditure, all current
spending, except the wage bill and fuel subsidies, have been reduced. The authorities are
determined to keep the wage bill unchanged in real terms and to continue resisting pressures
coming from different categories of professions. While recognizing that the lower global oil
prices have allowed them to lower the fuel price subsidies, the authorities reaffirm their
intention to apply the oil price adjustment mechanism taking into consideration prices
charged by the neighboring countries and the value of their currencies against the CFAF.

3
12. As regards Public Financial Management, key reforms have been implemented and
the Togolese authorities see the urgent need to pursue the remaining reforms agenda
including the establishment of the Treasury single account as well as the operationalization
of the Treasury cash management system to curb growing risks and improve budget
execution. The authorities also take note of the need to reorganize the ministry of finance
especially the establishment of a tax policy unit. To this end, they will continue to need
Fund technical assistance which has contributed much to the recent years’ improved
performance.
13. The authorities note the updated joint Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) which
indicates that Togo remains at a moderate risk of external public debt distress but has an
increased risk of overall public debt distress reflecting vulnerabilities in terms of debt
management and capacities constraints in domestic debt. While agreeing on the need to
restructure and enhance the capacity of debt management, the authorities do not share staffs’
overall assessment of an increased risk of public debt distress. They believe that their debt
levels remain below the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU)
convergence threshold, and that given the high demand for Togolese government securities
on the regional financial market, there are no risks of liquidity or refinancing. Moreover, staff
note in their assessment that under the baseline scenario, all external debt sustainability
indicators are expected to remain below their indicative thresholds throughout the projection
period, with vulnerabilities occurring only under alternative scenarios. The Togolese
authorities will take this assessment into consideration regarding future borrowings. They
would like to point out that they are committed to a prudent borrowing strategy, and have
taken measures to strengthen the technical and operational capacity of the debt management
unit, Direction de la dette publique. To this effect, they have requested additional technical
assistance.

14. The authorities are mindful of the challenges and vulnerabilities facing the financial
sector and remain determined to safeguard the sector’s stability by following international
standards in close collaboration with the regional Banking Commission of the WAEMU.
Measures to enhance the microfinance’s sector regulatory and supervisory framework in this
regard are underway. The CAS-IMEC, the unit monitoring the microfinance sector under
the supervision of the Ministry of economy, finance and development planning should see its
capacities improved in terms of staffing and resources.

undertaken by the provisional administration that was put in place. The authorities have

Structural reforms
16. In order to attain the objective of structural transformation of the economy and achieve
higher, sustained and inclusive growth, the Togolese authorities intend to strengthen
structural reforms. To this end, they welcome the focus at page 17 of the accompanying
Selected Issues paper on “Policies for sustainable growth”. The authorities intend to give full
consideration to the policy recommendations while pursuing their investment plan in the
infrastructures networks, which has proven to be effective and successful. Additionally, they
are committed to improving the role of the private sector in this process by creating a
favorable business climate, strengthening competitiveness and addressing the weaknesses in
sectors such as the energy, mining and telecom sectors. They believe that closing the
infrastructure gap and removing growth bottlenecks could be done by the public sector
through the public-private partnerships.
Data issues
17. On data issues, the authorities share staff main recommendations. The recent
establishment in February 2015 of the national statistics institute - Institut National de la
Statistique et des Etudes Economiques et Démographiques (INSEED)- is an evidence of the
importance of the issues to the authorities and of their determination to tackle them. Further
strengthening of the INSEED capacities with the assistance of the development partners will
help enhance Togo’s economic statistics (compilation and dissemination) and allow for a key
role in the accurate assessment of the country economic activity and major indicators.
Conclusion
18. Togo has made important progress over the past years regarding macroeconomic
performance and reforms agenda. Nevertheless, although growth has been strong and the
outlook is positive, much more remain to be done in terms of growth inclusiveness and
poverty reduction. The Togolese authorities recognize the challenges ahead and are
determined to pursue the structural transformation of their economy through enhanced
revenue mobilization, increased investment in infrastructure and education, health and
training. They will continue to seek the support of the Fund, the World Bank and other
developments partners in the implementation of their development agenda.
