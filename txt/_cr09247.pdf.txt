I. SUMMARY AND APPRAISAL
Up to the Spring of 2008, the Swedish economy boomed
1.
Since 2002, Sweden thrived in buoyant global conditions, reflecting strong policies
and a composition of output—investment goods and consumer durables—particularly
favored by the boom.
2.
But the same worldwide factors which supported this record also left Sweden highly
exposed to the post Fall-2007 financial crisis. Its investment goods and consumer durables
exports were hurt by weakening external demand long before the major contraction in global
trade late in 2008. And as the international financial wholesale markets closed and investor
concerns with Baltic exposures mounted, liquidity crunched. Having surfed the earlier global
wave, Sweden has been hit hard by its crash.
Policy action has steadied confidence, but the tide is still out
3.
The authorities’ response was prompt and appropriate, and immediate concerns with
financial sector stability have been addressed. The full range of measures typical elsewhere
was implemented, incorporating the agreed European Union (EU) response, including on the
fiscal side, full operation of automatic stabilizers and a discretionary budget loosening
for 2009—taking the budget from a surplus of 2½ percent of GDP in 2008, to a deficit of
4 percent in 2009. Much has been done.
4.
Immediate prospects for recovery are at the mercy of developments abroad. As a
producer of goods disproportionately favored by the prior global boom, Sweden was one of
the first into the downturn. And if demand for those goods recovers slowly relative to other
components of global demand—as seems likely given large output gaps, credit constraints,
and wait-and-see behavior by investors and consumers abroad—Sweden could be one of the
last out. Accordingly, with GDP already declining slightly through 2008, staff project it to
fall by 6 percent in 2009 with recovery firmly taking hold only from the middle of 2010. In
this context, unemployment will rise significantly.
Policy for 2009–10 should continue to aim to minimize the fall
5.
The ongoing integrated policy response could be strengthened in various ways, to
further boost Sweden’s resilience in this testing environment, while maintaining confidence.
Large fiscal stabilizers should continue to operate, along with the stimulus underway
6.
However, the case for additional discretionary fiscal activism to offset the downturn
is not persuasive at this juncture. The scale of the fiscal action underway—as measured by
the change in the general government headline balance—is, on staff projections, already one
of the largest in the EU. Furthermore, plausible estimates of potential output yield widely

4
varying estimates of the structural balance and the fiscal outlook, and it is unclear how much
public debt will rise due to financial sector rescue operations that may prove to be necessary.
In addition, the stabilizers are large, the multipliers are small, and with estimates of mediumterm potential output growth being lowered globally, the long run fiscal strength, apparent at
the outset of the crisis, will need to be thoroughly reassessed when the waters settle.
7.
Accordingly, the scale of the shift in the structural fiscal balance projected by staff—a
weakening of 2¼ percentage points of GDP in 2009, and a further ¼ percentage point
in 2010—goes as far as is appropriate in providing a decisive fiscal response to a uniquely
sharp fall in demand, without compromising sustainability. The composition of the
discretionary component of the shift focuses on tax reductions, aiding supply side
efficiencies even though their immediate demand impact is likely limited.
8.
On the fiscal side, the key strengthening suggested concerns operation of the fiscal
rules. The target of a surplus of 1 percent of GDP over the cycle should remain, as should the
firm commitment to the nominal spending ceilings, because these support fiscal
sustainability. But a new commitment to adjust the spending ceilings to offset the net
revenue impact of any further discretionary tax reforms on projected budget balances would
strengthen medium-term sustainability further.
Monetary policy is appropriate
9.
On the monetary side, a modest undershoot of the inflation target—1 to 3 percent—is
likely this year. However, risks of sustained disinflation appear low: in particular, short and
long term indicators of inflation expectations point this way. Only if inflation is expected to
fall significantly and on a sustained basis, should consideration be given to further action.
10.
The exchange rate is probably modestly undervalued. Given the particular exposure
of Sweden to the global collapse in demand for investment and durable consumer goods, a
good part of the recent depreciation is likely an equilibrating adjustment. Accordingly, along
with the reforms to labor market structures and income taxation in recent years, it will play a
key role in containing increases in unemployment and the accompanying concerns with
hysterisis.
Additional proactivity may strengthen the financial sector further
11.
Financial sector fragilities reflect Baltic exposures, recession, and banks’ reliance for
funding from global wholesale markets.
12.
These fragilities have been assessed in thorough stress tests, indicating that banks will
meet regulatory minimum requirements even in highly adverse contexts. But market
concerns about the adequacy of Swedish banks’ capital remain, indicating, as internationally,
that more remains to be done, notwithstanding the extraordinary stability support measures
that are in place.

5
13.
Further steps to strengthen the resilience of the banks, including by boosting capital,
when needed, and developing contingency planning, are warranted as soon as possible. Such
steps would boost resilience to short term shocks, reduce risks to credit supply and to
taxpayers, and enhance an early exit from the extraordinary support measures.
14.
Where specific banks appear to be at risk, enhanced supervision and (if needed) rights
issues should be considered. If such steps prove insufficient, then public equity—injected at
prices appropriate to ensure protection of taxpayer interests—and implementation of a badbank model are further options.
15.
Alongside, continued broader contingency planning by the authorities is also
appropriate, including further review of the toolkit for supervisory intervention to ensure
robustness. There is also scope for further increases in international reserves beyond those
already announced.
16.
Beyond this, the institutional capacity of the Financial Supervisory Agency should
be boosted. Given sizable international operations of large Swedish banks, further concerted
efforts to strengthen cross-border crisis resolution mechanisms, coordinated with EU
partners, should also be made.
17.

Sweden should remain on the standard 12–month consultation cycle.
II. THE CONTEXT—2004–08 1

In buoyant global conditions, Sweden thrived (Figures 1 and 2)
18.
Activity rebounded strongly after 2001–03, led initially by a turn-around in exports
and the associated boost to investment. Income flows from earlier foreign investments by
Swedish banks and corporates provided an additional boost. In this context, domestic factor
markets tightened, which, alongside positive wealth effects from the associated booms in
stock and house prices, buoyed private consumption. Household debt rose sharply, and
import growth caught up with, and eventually outpaced export growth.
This has reflected and supported strong policies
19.
As noted by the authorities, in the context of high household savings rates, countercyclical policies helped restrain demand (Figure 3; ¶60). Automatic stabilizers are large and
discretionary fiscal policy is tightly constrained by rules on the overall balance and on
expenditure (Box 1). This framework has produced strong fiscal outcomes (Table 8).
Inflation remained within the 1–3 percent target band bar mid-2008 when global food and oil

Box 2. Implementation of IMF Recommendations
Fiscal policy and framework. Consistent with IMF recommendations, the authorities have
maintained adherence to their fiscal rules.
Monetary policy: Following Fund recommendations, prior to fall 2008, the Riksbank
maintained a tightening bias to anchor inflation expectations—which remained above the upper
bound of inflation target. Since October, the monetary policy stance has been accommodative
to keep inflation expectations from falling below the lower band of inflation target.
Financial sector: IMF calls for a dedicated bank resolution framework have recently been
implemented, but a clear PCA type framework is required, more rapid Deposit Insurance
payout arrangements, and additional resourcing of the FSA remain outstanding.

Bank profitability grew rapidly between 2002–07, reflecting domestic and foreign
lending, including in the Baltics. Overall capital adequacy was around 10½ percent, while
Tier 1 capital adequacy was around 7 percent, with loan losses remaining low.
But strong growth has also reflected the composition of Sweden’s output (Text Table)
21.
Sweden’s output bundle is
dominated by investment-related and
durable consumption goods—
computers, industrial machine tools,
electrical equipment, and chemicals—
and increasingly, business services.
These goods disproportionately
benefited from the global boom
after 2002. This accounts, in part, for
rapid export growth to European
emerging markets, oil exporters, and to
booming Nordic economies.
22.
Alongside, Baltic entry
into the EU in 2004 heralded a
period of rapid growth in Swedish
banks’ asset acquisition there—
largely funded on buoyant
international capital markets. This
generated high income reflows
and strong performance of the
associated banks’ stock prices

Rather, both, in hindsight, appear to have reflected temporary surges, the first reflecting the
composition of global demand during a bubble—the 2009 Spring WEO projects growth of
fixed investment in coming years to significantly lag domestic demand in the US and Euro
areas, in contrast to earlier in the decade—and the second reflecting unsustainable returns from
bank investments in the Baltics. With durables, investment-input, and investment exports
constituting well over half of total exports, a reduction in their earlier-estimated trend growth
rate by 1/3 lowers total exports by some 1¼ percentage points of GDP by 2014. And the
revised outlook for the Baltic states may lower investment returns by some 3 percentage points
of GDP over the medium term.

Current CGER Estimates
Following these revisions, estimates as of May 2009 were as
follows (Text Table). The reported range is large and all the
2009
measures are subject to uncertainty. However, the External

implied by the RER estimate would be inconsistent with this.
And the macro balance estimate is much smaller. Accordingly, alongside other indicators,
notably the moderate level of inflation expectations, plummeting exports (like elsewhere), and
the similar goods competitiveness as was realized during the last global downturn, the staff
assessment, despite Krona depreciation since Q4 2008, is that the currency is probably not very
significantly undervalued.

By 2008, however, Sweden was highly exposed to external shocks
23.
The global factors supporting the recent boom also increased vulnerability to the
subsequent international recession. Swedish exports felt the impact as early as Q2 2008, with
a significant acceleration in the decline as elsewhere in Q4 2008 (Figure 6). In addition,
credit growth began to fall, both to households and corporates, albeit gently, with few signs,
even in the April 2009 lending conditions survey, of rationing.
24.
Meanwhile, weaker consumer confidence—reflecting tumbling equity values, rising
borrowing costs, and later, by falling employment—was reflected in greater precautionary
saving through all of 2008, and consumption fell. Subsequently, investment—already bruised
by falling exports and the global outlook—also fell starting Q2 2008. Output fell throughout
H2 2008.
Overt banking and financial sector strains also emerged
25.
Banks’ profitability fell sharply in 2008–09 despite negligible exposure to US
subprime—or other structured—assets (Figures 7 and 8). Two of the largest banks, both
increasingly funded on wholesale markets and exposed to the Baltics, both saw sharp
increases in loan losses with their share prices and ratings marked down accordingly. Money
market spreads—though lower than elsewhere—tightened sharply in Q4 2008 and have yet
to return to pre-crisis levels. The stock market dropped nearly 40 percent in 2008, recovering
somewhat recently, and spreads of mortgage bonds over government bonds rose to
unprecedented highs. Alongside, solvency ratios of insurers fell (Figure 9).

Monetary and Financial Sector Stability policies adjusted decisively
26.
Until September 2008, the Riksbank had maintained a tightening bias but the stance
has since switched to accommodating, as the severity of the deflationary impact arising from
the global financial crisis was increasingly recognized (Figure 10). The policy rate has been
cut by 425 basis points to ½ percent. Against this background, the freely floating Krona
depreciated significantly. The authorities have also taken a wide range of measures to
stabilize financial markets (Box 4).
And weaker activity was quickly reflected in budget revenue
27.
Against this backdrop, a shortfall in revenue lowered the general government fiscal
surplus from 3.8 percent of GDP in 2007 to 2½ percent of GDP in 2008. While expenditure
rose broadly in line with a planned increase of 4 percent, revenue rose just 1.6 percent
(compared with the budget-envisaged 4.1 percent). In addition to automatic stabilizers, the
significant decline in asset prices notably in stock market indices following the global
financial crisis took their toll on corporate income and capital income tax that had been
particularly buoyant in recent years. Excluding the cyclical and one-off factors, however,
given a small opening of the output gap, the structural balance is estimated to have improved
slightly in 2008 to about 2½ percent of GDP. Public debt stood at 38 percent of GDP at end2008.
And discretionary policies will weaken fiscal outturns further in 2009
28.
With automatic stabilizers at full play together with fiscal measures, a large fiscal
stimulus—6.6 percentage points of GDP deterioration in the headline budget balance—is
expected.

20

Box 4. Actions Taken to Stabilize the Financial Sector
Measures to increase Krona liquidity
•

Since October 2008, the repo rate was cut by 425 basis points to ½ percent.

•

The Riksbank started fully accepting covered bonds and lowered the minimum credit rating
requirements for long-term securities pledged as collateral.

•

The Riksbank set up new 3, 6, and 12-month loan facilities to facilitate banks’ access to longerterm funds.

•

The Riksbank established a new temporary credit facility using commercial paper as collateral
(with a maturity of up to one year) to facilitate the supply of credit for non-financial companies.

•

The National Debt Office issued treasury bills and invested the funds raised in covered bonds to
boost covered (mortgage) bond market.

•

The Riksbank granted emergency liquidity assistance facilities to Kaupthing Bank Sverige AB
and Carnegie Investment Bank AB (both SEK 5 billion). Later, Kaupthing Bank was liquidated,
while the licensing of Carnegie Investment Bank BA was revoked.

Measures to increase foreign exchange liquidity
•

The Riksbank and U.S. Fed set up temporary reciprocal swap facilities ($30 billion). A separate
swap facility was also established with the ECB.

•

New dollar term loan facilities (with the maturity of 28 and 84 days) have been offered.

•

The Riksbank began to restore the level of the foreign currency reserve funded by borrowing by
the National Debt Office of equivalent SEK 100 billion.

Measures to support banks’ capital and assure market confidence
•

The government increased the deposit guarantee from SEK 250,000 to SEK 500,000, and extend
the coverage to include all types of deposit in accounts (October 6, 2008).

•

In October 2008, the government approved a debt guarantee scheme for the medium-term
borrowing of banks and mortgage institutions. The total amount of guarantee was set at SEK
1.5 trillion, of which a maximum of SEK 0.5 trillion would be used for covered bonds with the
maturity of 3 months -5 years. An institution applying for the guarantee would pay fees and be
subject to restrictions on remuneration for senior management. Two financial institutions have
availed themselves of this guarantee scheme.

•

The bank recapitalization scheme is intended for banks and other credit institutions. The
government’s capital takes the form of shares or hybrid capital (Tier 1 capital). Participating
institutions are subject to restrictions on remuneration for senior management.

•

In October 2008, the government enacted “Government Support to Credit Institutions Act” which
gives the National Debt Office power to take over a troubled bank if there is a serious systemic
risk and bank capital falls below 25 percent of the regulatory requirement (¶67).

•

The government set up a stabilization fund to finance government measures to support the
financial system (the sources of the funds are annual fees from banks and other credit institutions).

Staff has estimated the net expected cost of all these actions at 7.7 percent of Swedish GDP.

III. OUTLOOK AND RISKS
External factors continue to weigh on near term prospects
29.
Given output and exports dominated by capital goods and consumer durables,
Sweden may be both an early and chronic victim of the global recession, if global demand
for those goods recovers slowly relative to other components of global demand. This may be
compounded by exposure to the Baltics, and the likely slow recovery of global wholesale
markets on which Sweden’s banks have hitherto depended heavily.
30.
Imports of Sweden’s trading partners grew on average over 8½ percent annually
between 2004–07, by just 2½ percent in 2008, and are projected to fall 11 percent in 2009,
recovering significantly only in 2011. Given strong US and Eurozone spillovers, this will
weigh heavily on the Swedish outlook (Attachment I). Accordingly, income, unemployment,
and confidence effects will depress private consumption growth through 2009—which is not
expected to return to positive territory until early 2010, and only to make a fuller recovery
well beyond that. This, and the outlook for exports, is expected to be reflected in a fall in
investment through 2009, with recovery beginning in the second half of 2010. These
developments will also be reflected in falling imports, shielding activity somewhat, though
the trade balance will likely deteriorate in both 2009 and 2010.
31.
Consequently, though the authorities were somewhat more optimistic, quarterly
GDP will likely fall through 2009—with annual activity projected to shrink by 6 percent—
before recovering sufficiently to yield a flat path in annual terms by end-2010 (Text Table;
Table 2; ¶61). Recovery in the global economy post-2010 is anticipated to result in a quicker
growth in exports and domestic demand beyond 2011, raising GDP growth up to 3¾–
4½ percent during 2012–14. But on the external side, weakness in the Baltics is expected to
permanently lower income flows relative to the recent past.
32.
Headline annual CPI inflation will be considerably lower through 2009 reflecting
weak demand, the impact of lower interest rates on housing costs, and global energy and
food price developments, despite the impact on prices from the Krona depreciation. A
gradual increase—corresponding to that in demand—is expected in 2010.

Various downside risks are associated with this outlook
•

Prolonged global financial market strains, even weaker-than-projected export
markets, and worse Baltic outturns.

•

Weakening housing and property markets, along with rising unemployment, would
decrease collateral values and the supply of credit-worthy borrowers.

•

Corporate financial positions are weakening. Since 2007, companies’ capacity to
cover interest payments has deteriorated.

But these are mitigated by various factors
•

Global recovery could be faster than projected.

•

Stabilization efforts in Baltic countries could succeed, with stronger-than-projected
activity, reducing associated uncertainties.

•

The significant fiscal and monetary relaxations, including via a significant
depreciation, could cushion the projected downturn in 2009.

And the outlook for potential output is unclear
33.
Recent Swedish global integration has raised growth and amplified the volatility of
output. Correct identification of the trend and the cycle is key to projections of the near- and
medium-term prospects (Box 5).

24
Box 5. Prospects for Sweden’s potential output
Conventional approaches—HP filtering of real GDP or simple estimation of Solow residuals in
Cobb-Douglas framework—may malfunction given the unique depth of the ongoing recession.
In particular, application of the HP filter to the Cobb-Douglas production function does not
capture the fall in trend capital accumulation and trend growth in total working hours that may
accompany the current downturn—as they did during the early 1990s recession. Consequently, it
assigns greater part of the volatility in real GDP to the cycle, and hence, potential GDP exhibits
the least correlation with output over the last decade under this approach implying scope for a
large recovery from the present downturn. At the opposite extreme, simple HP-filtering of the
real GDP series may deliver an excessively volatile trend estimate.
To address these issues, two further exercises were conducted. First, the production function
approach was modified to allow for a deterioration in trend capital accumulation and in trend
growth in total working hours of magnitudes comparable to the early 1990s over the forecast
horizon. These ad hoc adjustments likely provide a lower bound on trend growth in factor inputs,
as reforms to labor market structures and income taxation in recent years is anticipated to limit
labor market hysteresis relative to the 1990s.
Second, a trend line was fitted to the Solow residuals from a Cobb-Douglas decomposition of
real Swedish GDP, and used to estimate potential output. The raw TFP estimates indicate
various breaks: (i) in 1975, possibly reflecting the global oil shock; (ii) in 1995, possibly
reflecting the banking crisis and associated institutional changes (e.g., floating currency, labor
market reforms enhancing productivity); and (iii) in 2006, possibly an early sign of the
unsustainable global boom then underway. So the linear representation of TFP trends, with
turning points reflecting these 3 breaks, was constructed and the resulting series applied together
with labor and capital inputs to obtain a trend GDP series (Figure 11).
These exercises underscore the fragility of the standard—and indeed other—approaches to
estimating potential output now. And even though most of them suggest medium-run potential
growth in the region of 2 percent, the uncertainty surrounding all the measures suggests that this
“average” is not a strong result. In the short term, both additional exercises described yield
estimates of the output gap which lie between the extremes yielded by the standard
methodologies. Finally, because the segmented time trend approach seems to best describe
developments during the 1990s recession, that approach has been used as the baseline case.

IV. IMPLICATIONS FOR POLICIES AND POLICY FRAMEWORKS: 2009–10
34.
Even with domestic policies well cast, prospects are gloomy for an early end to the
recession that is underway. And any case for more stimulative countervailing domestic
policies should carefully weigh risks that they may backfire and so compound the downturn.
35.
In that context, the immediate priority is to ensure that the financial stability
framework is ready to address downside tail risks should those materialize. Alongside, with
the medium-term focus of fiscal policy remaining strongly credible, the operation of
automatic stabilizers should proceed unimpeded. Furthermore, with inflation pressures
abruptly diminished, support for activity from monetary action—both conventional and, if
needed, unconventional—should remain aggressive. These steps will cushion the downturn,
and buttress resilience to any additional shocks.
A. Financial Sector Policy and Framework
36.
Challenges to financial sector stability derive from exposure to Baltic countries
whose EU and Euro convergence aspirations have faltered, a severe Nordic (including
domestic) economic recession, and banks’ reliance on global wholesale markets—now
impaired—for their financing. All three interrelate, through market assessments of bank
capital adequacy. And the framework for handling crises requires further strengthening
(Boxes 6 and 7).
37.
The authorities’ actions have addressed the immediate fallout from these strains
(¶66). Official liquidity support has cushioned the loss of wholesale finance; the increase in
bank deposit insurance limits has helped stabilize the deposit base; one domestic bank has
been resolved; others have raised capital; and the authorities’ commitment to “do what is
needed” has calmed both deposit and interbank markets. With the market still exposed to
further possible shocks, including from abroad, as the authorities pointed out, that leaves the
challenge of how and when to strengthen banks further, how to ensure that the flow of credit
does not become a bottleneck to growth, and how to eventually exit from these extraordinary
measures (¶67).
Recent stress tests follow best international practice
38.
The most recent step addressing these challenges was publication of stress tests by
the Riksbank and the FSA respectively. Both base case scenarios reflected 4½ percent GDP
declines in 2009, and elevating credit losses in the Baltics, with probabilities of default and
losses given default ratios based on past Swedish and international patterns. The stress
scenarios both reflected expert adjustments to those ratios, consistent with assumed GDP
contraction at twice the base case rate, along with impaired earnings. Under these
assumptions, both sets of stress tests found that all banks observed the 4 percent Tier 1
capital requirement even in the stress scenario. The severity of the underlying assumptions
used, the detailed institutional analysis, and the transparency and speed with which the

27
results were reported all reflect best practice. But market concerns about the adequacy of
Swedish banks’ resilience remain, as indicated by bank stock prices, CDS spreads, and the
continued freeze in the interbank market, although financial prices have eased from their
troughs of a few months ago, in the context of the stabilization of international financial
markets.
This indicates, as elsewhere, that more needs to be done
39.
Ultimately, banks’ business models, contingency plans, and capital ratios should all
signal both institutional and market resilience, even in the absence of extraordinary
stabilizing support. And significant steps towards such resilience would best be required over
a relatively short time horizon. Early action—with due regard to costs—would reduce
vulnerability to short term shocks, risks of curbed credit supply, contingent claims on
taxpayers, and it would anticipate eventual exit from the extraordinary support measures.
40.
As part of this, work should continue with all banks to ensure appropriate
contingency plans. Enhanced supervisory scrutiny is the appropriate first response to
institutions most at risk. Using Basel's Pillar II approach, such banks could also be assigned a
higher capital requirement, which they would be expected to meet over time including
through new rights offerings and (as a bridge) via the government’s capitalization program.
This approach would not be procyclical. Market concern with banks’ robustness constitutes
the binding constraint on banks’ credit extension decisions now. Swift relief of that
constraint, backed by public injection of equity where necessary, will boost credit prospects.
The authorities are proceeding cautiously (¶67).
41.
Such a strengthened preemptive strategy will require continued close cooperation of
all the domestic and host countries authorities of foreign subsidiaries of Swedish banks. And
to address risk that the strategy is overtaken by events, such as further bouts of investor
uncertainty, contingency plans should be developed alongside in coordination with relevant
regional authorities. With banks overtly stronger and contingency plans strengthened,
resilience would be enhanced. Beyond this, the institutional capacity of the FSA should be
boosted, including by prompt determination of strengthened arrangements for its ongoing
resourcing, and it should expand its mandate to deposit-taking non-bank financial
institutions.
42.
The 2006 FATF assessment report suggested some weaknesses in Sweden’s
AML/CFT framework. Among several measures to address such concerns, Sweden
implemented the third EU Money Laundering Directive on March 15, 2009.

28
Box 6. Is Sweden Ready to Manage Financial Instability?
Some elements of the financial stability framework could usefully be strengthened.
•

Bank resolution framework. In October 2008, the government enacted “Government
Support to Credit Institutions Act” which gives the National Debt Office power to grant
credit guarantees, and if there is a serious systemic risk and bank capital falls below
25 percent of the regulatory requirement, take over a troubled bank The effectiveness of
this new scheme, including how and when to use intervention power, has yet to be
demonstrated in practice (¶67).

•

A Prompt Corrective Action framework is needed, covering all banks and fully
empowering the FSA to take the full range of supervisory corrective actions.

•

Supervisory capacity. The FSA has been constrained by high staff turnover, and it
would benefit from greater funding, including to allow more thorough on-site
inspections. Supervisory oversight over the leverage ratio and maturity mismatch could
be strengthened.

•

Deposit insurance scheme. Under the current legal framework, deposit insurance funds
can only be disbursed after a failed bank is placed into bankruptcy, which could be a
lengthy process. Furthermore, the ability of the authorities to obtain relevant information
about the balance sheet of a troubled bank at an early stage should be clarified.

•

Cross border coordination. There are major uncertainties in how a cross-border crisis
would be resolved in a coordinated way. Memorandums of Understanding on crisis
management were signed at the EU level and with three Baltic countries, but generally
lack specifics and are not legally binding.

•

Emergency liquidity assistance (ELA). The design of the ELA framework is generally
sound to deal with domestic liquidity problems. Nonetheless, how ELA would work for
cross-border liquidity problems remain unclear.

•

Non-bank financial institution supervision. A number of non-bank financial institutions
raise deposits, but they are not subject to FSA supervision nor reporting requirements.

29
Box 7. How do the Baltic Subs Affect the Case to Support Swedish Banks?
Swedish banks’ exposures
to the Baltic are extensive.
SEB and Swedbank hold
significant market shares
there (40–80 percent in loan
markets and 30–85 percent
in deposit markets), and the
authorities remain engaged
with these activities (¶67).

December 2006, the
Riksbank signed a quadripartite Memorandum of Understanding with central banks of Estonia,
Latvia, and Lithuania to set an agreement on cross-border cooperation in crisis management
situations. In February 2009, with uncertainties about the external viability of Baltic countries
heightened, the Riksbank entered into currency swap agreements with Latvia (the Riksbank to
lend up to EUR 375 million) and Estonia (up to SEK 10 billion).
This reflects close Swedish-Baltic linkages:
•

Direct financial linkage. Swedish banks’ equity and loan claims on their Baltic
subsidiaries at end 2008 represented 8 percent of Swedish GDP, while their loans to
their subs amounts to 35–45 percent of bank capital. In addition, Swedish banks’
reliance on operating profits from Baltic operations is extensive (25 percent for
Swedbank and nearly 10 percent for SEB). Accordingly, a deterioration in asset quality
or profits in Baltic subsidies could present material risks to Swedish banks’ capital.

•

Possible contagion. Retreat from the Baltic subsidiaries could damage the franchise
value of the parents, with possible contagion through the Swedish banking system, and
the region.

•

Overall macroeconomic stability. A disorderly retreat from the subsidiaries could
prompt broader loss of confidence in Sweden.

Given these considerations and the risks in the Baltics, a coordinated regional
contingency plan is needed. It should address (i) the division of crisis management
responsibility; (ii) methodology for evaluating bank asset quality and diagnosing the viability
of institutions; (iii) restructuring policies; and (iv) burden sharing agreements addressing the
respective liabilities of the home and host fiscal authorities. The last will need to be carefully
considered—given various options that may be considered. A credible contingency plan would
help stabilize confidence in the Baltic region and, by extension, in Sweden itself.

30

B. Fiscal Policy and Framework
The fiscal framework is strong
43.
Sweden entered the downturn in robust fiscal health. Debt was low and falling, the
framework of rules guiding policy has been consistently adhered to and the authorities have
reiterated their commitment to it even in the context of the ongoing global shock. And not
only is Sweden one of only a few countries to have completed a full long-term fiscal
balance sheet exercise, but of those, it is one of very few to have strong results even under
that most testing of examinations.
44.
As the authorities underscore, that does not however establish the case for
discretionary fiscal activism beyond that which is already planned (¶62). First, uncertainty
over the level and path for potential output implies a substantial range of uncertainty around
estimates of the structural balance now, and therefore the consistency of the current stance
with the fiscal rule (See Box 8). Second, the fiscal stabilizers appear to be large and fiscal
multipliers appear to be small, as suggested by the 2-country version of the IMF Global
Integrated Monetary and Fiscal Model (See Text Table & Figure and Attachment III).
Furthermore, it is unclear at this point how significant the public debt implications will be of
any financial sector rescue operation, net of recoveries. And finally, the composition of any
stimulus matters.

Given the absolute size of automatic stabilizers and multipliers, the potential burden
of the financial sector on public debt, and uncertainties about the structural balance, the scale
of the authorities’ proposals for discretionary action in 2009–10 has merit. But it will strain
efforts to remain compliant with the fiscal rule, and the composition of the discretionary
stimulus raises some concerns.

31
Box 8. Implications of Various Estimates of Potential Output for the Budget
The wide range of estimates for potential GDP and the output gap imply uncertainty in assessing
the underlying fiscal stance—a range of nearly 3 percentage points of GDP for 2008—with
associated widely varying implications about the space within the fiscal rule for discretionary
stimulus. And trend output may be hit by further external shocks, with staff model-based
estimates suggesting that such output volatility could reach ±1.1 percentage points of GDP a
year.

Much of the turnaround reflects the
effects of the automatic stabilizers. With
relatively high tax burden to finance the
generous welfare system, public finances in
Sweden are comparatively sensitive to cyclical
fluctuations and labor market developments.
The Spring Bill projects a sizeable widening of
the output gap in 2009 (to 7.2 percent). In this
context, the full operation of the automatic
stabilizers accounts for more than half of the
deterioration in general government finances.

1.6 percent of GDP. These are mostly on the
tax side, including permanent cuts in personal, social contributions and corporate income tax,
amounting to 1 percent of GDP. Though these steps will yield supply-side efficiencies and
the income tax cut was well targeted to lower income households, their immediate impact on
aggregate demand is likely small. In particular, the estimated multiplier for such tax cut is
only 0.35, compared with a 0.7 from expenditure measures. In response to further
deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook, additional measures were introduced especially
to boost active labor market policies.

49.
The structural balance—on the authorities’ estimates of potential output—is
projected to remain in surplus of at least 1 percent of GDP at all times through the projection
period—consistent with the fiscal rule. But the margin for error—or to allow further
adjustment if needed—is limited under the rule. On official projections, public debt rises to
46 percent of GDP in 2012 (See Text Table).
50.
A larger than projected deterioration in the fiscal accounts in 2009 appears likely,
reaching a deficit of slightly above 4 percent of GDP, in part reflecting staff’s more
pessimistic view about the near-term growth outlook ¶61). In addition, possible official
overestimation of the structural balance in 2008—reflecting staff’s more pessimistic view
about Sweden’s potential growth in recent years—and the end of “windfall” revenues
associated with the boom in asset prices, impacting corporate and capital income, also play a
role in this difference of view. This assessment lowers even further the estimated margin for
discretionary policy consistent with the fiscal rule.

51.
The budget outlook is relatively robust to assumptions about prospects for aging
costs (Figure 12). Projections of these costs—2.6 percent of GDP over the period 2007-60
based on the 2009 Aging Report by the European Commission—compare with 5.2 percent
for Euro area countries). Furthermore, the public sector balance sheet approach assessing
the long-run intertemporal financial position based on staff baseline scenario shows positive
net worth through 2060, albeit by a small margin (Table 9). Accordingly, debate about
changing pension adjustments for asset returns raises concerns for sustainability. The rule
requires cuts in nominal pensions in 2010 due to low recent returns. But even a “temporary”
suspension of the rule could, de facto, become permanent if it is repeated. Adjusting the
formula to smooth the path will address these long-term risks, only if smoothing is
symmetric and the formula remains unchanged thereafter.

A change to the expenditure ceiling framework may be needed
52.
In the current economic downturn, the established fiscal indicators (the structural
balance, 7-year rolling average and the cumulative overall budget balance measures) will
malfunction. Even if the structural fiscal balance is maintained at a surplus of 1 percent of
GDP, these indicators will flash red simply because headline budget balances, boosted by
automatic stabilizers will show such large deficits during the recession. For this reason, these
indicators should be deemphasized and an alternative means of showing adherence to the
medium-term surplus target may be needed.
53.
In this context, the firm commitment to the nominal spending ceilings should be
maintained. This would also avoid a structural drift in spending especially when the
underlying fiscal position is difficult to measure. In addition, this allows automatic stabilizers
to operate unhindered on the revenue side, while accommodating considerable latitude for
this on the spending side. However, to ensure that this is consistent with the surplus target
over the medium-term, any impact on net revenues reflecting further discretionary tax
reforms on projected budget balances need to be offset by an equal downward adjustments in
expenditure ceilings. The Fiscal Council could play a useful role in monitoring compliance
with the letter and the spirit of these principles. This option remains under review by the
authorities (Attachment III; ¶63).

An undershoot of the 2009 inflation target is now likely
55.
The staff’s baseline forecast—consistent with the authorities— is for a steady decline
in inflation through most of 2009, followed by a return to a positive inflation—but still below

36
the lower bound of target—by the middle of 2010 (¶64). This forecast is based on (i) the
authorities’ expansionary fiscal policy stance; (ii) subdued commodity process (WEO
projections); and (iii) the growth outlook discussed in Section III.
However, the monetary stance should be retained, for now
56.
Risks of sustained disinflation appear low. Nominal wage patterns, inflation models,
market analysts’ assessments, and short and long-term indicators of inflation expectations,
including 5-10 year breakeven inflation rates, all point this way, with many of the latter
having rebounded from troughs at end-2008. This partly reflect significant depreciation of
the exchange rate since fall 2008, which has, implicitly, relaxed monetary conditions
considerably.
57.
Accordingly, the case for further immediate steps into Quantitative Easing (QE) is not
compelling. As the authorities indicate, only if inflation expectations fall below target on a
sustained basis, should consideration be given to the various QE options (Box 9; ¶65).
Actions to support individual credit markets, if any of these fail, should remain under review,
nevertheless.
Box 9. Options for Quantitative Easing
•

Outright purchase of assets. In close coordination with the Ministry of Finance, the Riksbank
could increase purchase of government bonds at its own discretion. This measure is expected to
lower long-term government bond yields. The Riksbank could also assist specific frozen
markets, such as mortgages, to restore normal functioning of the monetary transmission
mechanism. However, risks to the Riksbank’s balance sheet as well as an exit strategy should be
considered, with the government guaranteeing the Riksbank against financial losses, if needed.

•

The usage of the NDO’s treasury functions. The NDO could increase the issuance of treasury
bills in exchange of frozen market securities. This option would clarify the division of labor
between monetary and fiscal functions.

•

Non-sterilization of foreign asset purchases by the central bank could be considered.

The Inflation Targeting framework serves well
58.
The Riksbank is among the most transparent of inflation targeters. It publishes
policy committee minutes with two-week lag, a three-year inflation forecast, and
corresponding interest rate path. This enhances effective communication. Recently,
publication of individual votes of the Executive Board members has begun. However,
in 2007, the government-sponsored special commission proposed amendments to the
Riksbank Act, aimed at strengthening the Riksbank’s financial independence. Until now, no
follow-up actions have been taken. And, as with inflation targeting regimes elsewhere,

37
there may be need in the aftermath of the global financial crisis to review if and how their
operations could be further strengthened in light of that experience.
59.
The recent decision to raise international reserves by SEK 100 billion—2 percent of
total external debt—will boost resilience (See Text Table). As the authorities suggested,
although reserves are complemented by

curb institutions’ access to international capital markets. In this way, banking stresses could
spill over into pressures on the Krona. Thus, to support the subsidiaries, the exchange rate
regimes of their hosts, and address possible fallout on the Krona, additional foreign
currency resources may be required.
V. THE AUTHORITIES’ VIEWS 2
60.
Sustained strong policies—as reflected in low inflation, significant current account
and budget surpluses translating into long-term fiscal sustainability and low public debt, low
unemployment, and structural labor market and tax reforms aimed at increasing supply-side
efficiencies—have prepared Sweden well to face the global crisis (¶18–22, 43, and 58).
The economic outlook has weakened significantly
61.
Given global conditions and recently revised quarterly national accounts data, the
Ministry of Finance in the Spring Bill in April projects output to fall some 4¼ percent
in 2009 (¶23–35). Downside risks are contained by expansionary fiscal and monetary
policies, the strong automatic stabilizers, Krona depreciation, and the strong and flexible
2

38
structural characteristics of the economy. In this context, reforms to unemployment benefits,
labor market programs, and the tax regime in recent years will reduce risks of labor market
hysteresis. But options for further such measures remain under active review.
Fiscal policy—allowing scope for large stabilizers—should remain bound by rules
62.
Though stimulus measures predated the intensified global financial crisis from the
Fall of 2008, they provided the stimulus needed in the face of the downturn. In this context,
given firm commitment to maintain strong fiscal sustainability, no need is apparent now for
further broad based discretionary fiscal stimulus, and the fiscal rule—targeting a 1 percent
overall surplus over the cycle and respecting the three year expenditure ceilings—remains
(¶44–51).
63.
The risks of the established fiscal indicators malfunctioning, even if policy remains
on course for its medium-term target, are recognized (¶52). But the appropriate option to
address this difficulty remains under review. In principle, staff’s suggestion of adjusting the
expenditure ceiling mechanism would address the difficulty, but such a change runs the clear
risk of undermining a long-established and credible anchor of the fiscal framework (¶53). In
the authorities’ view, there is no alternative to a continued thorough annual analysis of the
budget balance, notwithstanding the uncertainties associated with measures of the structural
balance.
Interest rate cuts have successfully averted threat of disinflation
64.
A further decline in the headline CPI is anticipated for the remainder of 2009, but
underlying inflation (excluding mortgage interest rates) is expected to hover around
2 percent, and inflation expectations continue to be anchored at the target level of 2 percent.
The outlook for policy remains accommodative, with the repo rate expected to stay at
½ percent through 2009–10. The impact of monetary actions already taken remains under
review (¶ 54–56).
65.
Nevertheless, the preparation for possible next steps are underway, partly because
term rates remain more elevated than is desired. While the repo rate could be further
lowered—the floor is not necessarily at ½ a percent—options for the unconventional
measures included the provision of 12 month fixed rate loans at the repo rate and the outright
purchase of government bonds. Beyond that, purchase of mortgage or corporate bonds would
imply undue credit risks and distort still-functioning corporate credit markets (¶57). In regard
to the exchange rate, the freely floating regime will be maintained, but increases in
international reserves are warranted, on a pre-announced schedule, to address financial
stability risks (¶59). The Riksbank targets inflation, but has no target for the Krona.

39
Financial sector stabilization policy is comprehensive
66.
Liquidity support, the guarantee program, and other steps consistent with the EU
response, have contributed to stabilizing financial markets (Box 4; ¶37). However, normal
functioning has not resumed and the situation remains fragile. The recent stress tests for
major banks show that loan losses are expected to rise, but banks will still meet the minimum
regulatory capital requirements even under the most stressed scenarios (¶38–41).
67.
The recent bank resolution law empowers the government to take over failing banks,
with recourse for the shareholders to the Examination Board of three judges strictly limited to
examine the appropriateness of the conditions—the takeover itself is not subject to review by
the Examination Board or any other legal authority. Looking ahead, as credit losses become
clearer, banks may have to raise capital to fill the shortfalls over time. If needed, banks will
be recapitalized through government capital injections of common stock. Swedish banks
have made commitments to continue to support their subsidiaries with liquidity and capital.
Since the outbreak of the crisis, the authorities have continuously been involved in a dialogue
with the major Swedish banks. It should be noted that the measures that the government has
adopted have not been ring-fenced and have thus been able to benefit entire banking groups.
Looking ahead, the government’s actions will be guided by need to safeguard the legitimate
interests of taxpayers (¶39–41).

ATTACHMENT I. GLOBAL SPILLOVERS TO SWEDEN, AND ITS EXTERNAL VULNERABILITY.1
1.
Sweden’s exposure to the global business cycle—as measured by both, trade and
financial linkages—has increased substantially over the last two decades, with a marked
acceleration in this process during the recent boom.
2.
On the trade front, this is
evident from the increase in export
and import volumes, both in
absolute terms, and in relation to
the size of the economy. Activity
related to exports contributed, on
average, over 35 percent of
economic growth since 1990, a
substantial increase compared to
the 1980s.2 Sweden’s export basket
is dominated by goods and services
characterized by cyclically sensitive
demand.

Prepared by Jay Surti.

On an average contribution basis, net exports has supplied 0.8 percentage points to annual GDP growth since
1990—36 percent of the total. The comparable numbers through the 1980s were 0.1 percentage points—or 2
percent of the total.

50
3.
Over the last decade, the rapid development of global and EU capital markets and
products, and the recovery and growth of its own banking sector since the mid-1990s, has
resulted in large financial flows into and out of Sweden. Banks and larger NFCs have
increased borrowing from international capital markets, and in turn, this has translated into a
substantial increase in overseas assets held by Swedish institutions. For example, investment
of financial capital into the Baltic region has increased systematically over the last decade,
and particularly since 2005. The resulting income flows have bolstered the current account—
and national income—non-trivially during the recent boom.3

The turn-around in net factor income from abroad has—in a longer-term context—also benefited by the
secular depreciation in the public sector’s external liabilities.

Spillover Channels
5.
The primary objective of this note is to quantify the trade and output impact—
visually apparent in these GDP dynamics—on Sweden of cyclical fluctuations in its major
trading partners. After discussing the various spillover channels, we formally investigate
their significance via alternate VAR models.4
6.
These trends suggest that global financial and economic cycles may be expected to
exert significant impact on Swedish GDP. There are at least 3 channels through which such
an impact may arise:
•

Trade Channel: through the direct impact on Swedish exports due to shocks to
domestic—hence import—demand, and to GDP more generally, in Sweden’s key
trading partners. This includes the Euroarea, the Nordic countries, the U.S., and
since 1995, emerging Europe, particularly, the Baltic countries (Text Table).

While a large number of potential domestic and external covariates will be identified, the actual specifications
will be necessarily parsimonious as the sample size is limited to 1995Q2–2008Q4. Data needs are met via time
series information on Swedish domestic demand, trade, unemployment, and GDP (Statistics Sweden); GDP for
trading partners in the Baltic region (Eurostat), the Nordic region, the Eurozone, and the U.S. (OECD); retail
sales and gross fixed investment in the Nordic countries, the Eurozone, and the U.S. (Haver); Swedish basis
spread (Haver); and the NASDAQ composite index (Bloomberg).

latter appear to follow growth dynamics of the
U.S. economy (Text Figure).

GDP
8.
The informal description above renders plausible, as a starting hypothesis, that
Swedish GDP is statistically associated with GDP in the US, the Eurozone, Nordic-Baltic
trading partners, global equity indexes—proxied throughout by the NASDAQ composite—
(positively), and with oil prices, domestic credit market conditions, and unemployment
(negatively).
9.
Results are reported for a specification including in reverse order, Swedish GDP,
domestic unemployment and basis spread, Baltic GDP, Nordic GDP, Eurozone GDP, and
U.S. GDP (Text Figures). For a number of alternative specifications and variable orderings,
impulse responses of Swedish GDP are consistently of the expected sign, and quantitatively
large and persistent, with respect to innovations in U.S. and Eurozone GDP, and domestic
credit spreads. For example, a one percentage point increase in U.S. and Euroarea GDP
growth is associated with as much as 3/5 and ¾ percentage point rise in Swedish GDP over
four quarters. For others (e.g., domestic unemployment), the impulse response was sensitive
to the specification being in-levels as opposed to in-rates-of-change, and for some (e.g., oil
prices, Nordic-Baltic GDP), impulse responses were consistently quantitatively negligible.5
5

Specifications wherein the covariates were represented in terms of rates of change did not present problems of
data non-stationarity. For the in-levels specifications, vector error correction models were chosen instead of
VARs where necessary. GDP for non-U.S. trading partners is taken to mean the component of the data series
(continued)

53
However, in a manner most likely reflective of the small sample size that begins in the 1990s
(1995Q1), the impulse responses are statistically insignificant for almost all specifications,
including those covariates for which they are quantitatively large (Text Figure).

The negative results for Nordic and Baltic GDP may be partly explained by the fact
that the covariates are designed to be the component of these economies’ GDP that is “not
driven by” U.S. GDP, and it may well be the case that purely idiosyncratic economic shocks
to these small, open economies may not produce a tangible cyclical response.

ATTACHMENT II. HAVE THE RIGHT LESSONS BEEN LEARNED FROM THE BANKING CRISIS OF
THE 1990S? 1
1.
Sweden’s approach to its banking crisis of the early 1990s—generally perceived as
“quick action, bank nationalization, bad banks, and transparency— is widely viewed as a
success. Many suggest that this provides useful lessons for global policy now. However,
this review suggests that the lessons may be richer and more subtle than that.
A. THE ROOTS OF THE EARLY 1990S BANKING CRISIS
2.
Financial market deregulation spurred a lending boom; this was compounded by
pro-cyclicality in macroeconomic policy; and the fixed exchange regime aggravated financial
system vulnerabilities.
•

Financial liberalization through the 1980s lifted credit constraints, resulting in a major
boost to bank lending (Drees and Pazarbaşioĝlu, 1998, and Attachment II Figure 1).
Banks focused on market share rather than profitability, alongside weaknesses in risk
management, governance, and internal controls (Ingves, 2002).

•

Bank supervision lacked authority and capacity, and supervisory frameworks were
unprepared for deregulated markets (Ingves, 2002).

•

Deregulation led to a real estate bubble in the late 1980s, which further fueled credit
expansion through increased collateral value (Lundgren, 2009).

•

Monetary policy options were limited under the fixed exchange rate regime, and the
expansionary macroeconomic policy stance led to higher inflation by early 1990.
Meanwhile, the real exchange rate followed a steady upward trend.

3.
In 1990, the economic boom ended, and strains in the financial system began to
emerge. Global interest rates rose in the wake of German reunification, domestic recession
began, real estate prices fell sharply, and speculative attacks began on the Krona. In response,
monetary policy was sharply tightened, compounding activity weakness. In the Fall of 1990,
financial companies faced financial difficulties, and a year later, two large banks,
Nordbanken (state-owned) and Főrsta Sparbanken, announced difficulties in meeting
prudential capital requirements. The government injected capital to the former and provided
a loan guarantee to the latter. By mid-1992, volatility in foreign exchange and money
markets had heightened significantly, and increased numbers of banks and mortgage

57
companies faced financial difficulties. International capital markets were all but shut down
for Swedish banks and firms (Appendix II Box 1).

Appendix II Box 1. Sweden: Major Events of the Swedish Banking Crisis in 1990-1996
1990: In Autumn, financial companies started to face financial difficulties. One of the major financial
companies, Gamlestaden, was taken over by Nordbanken.
1991: In Autumn, financial difficulties in Nordbanken and Swedbank became clear. The government, as the
major owner of Nordbanken, subscribed SKr 4.2 billion (½ percent of GDP) of its SKr 5.1 billion new
share issue.
1992: In spring, the government bought all outstanding shares of Nordbanken (SKr 2.1 billion). Nordbanken’s
bad assets were transferred to its asset management company, Securum AB, later in 1992.
In September, the Gota Group faced severe financial problems. The government announced its intention
to present a bill to the parliament to grant a general state guarantee covering all Swedish-chartered banks
and their foreign subsidiaries (at that time no formal deposit insurance was in place), as well as mortgage
companies. Meanwhile, the Riksbank continued to supply abundant liquidity, including depositing foreign
currency funds in banks.
In December, the government approved a bill, “Measures for Strengthening the Financial System.” The
parent company of Gota Bank, Gota AB, was declared bankrupt, and the government nationalized Gota
Bank.
1993: In early year, the government took over Securum AB from Nordbanken. The BSA established an asset
management company for failed Gota Bank, Retriva, for the management of the bad assets of Gota Bank.
In February, SEB and Swedbank applied for bank support measures. However, later on, both of these
banks announced its intention to raise capital by issuing new shares and withdrew the application.
In November, the government offered capital adequacy protection support to Főrningsbanken.
In late 1993, Gota Bank (the good assets) was auctioned and merged into Nordbanken.
1996: In July, the parliament approved a bill, “Ending the Bank Support,” official declaring the end of the
banking crisis.

B. “Swedish Model”
Banking crisis resolution policies
4.
By mid-1992, investor confidence had plummeted. To head off the risk of a fullblown banking and BOP crisis, in September 1992, the authorities announced a blanket
unlimited guarantee to all creditors and depositors, except share capital and perpetual
debentures, covering the entire banking system. This was followed, on December 18, 1992,
by a new bank resolution framework bill, “Measures for Strengthening the Financial
System,” a watershed move toward resolving the banking crisis.

58

The key resolution measures taken:
•

The Bank Support Authority (BSA). The government created a new agency—
separate from the Ministry of Finance (MOF), the Riksbank, and Financial
Supervisory Authority (FSA)—in order to avoid capacity constraints and conflict of
interest issues in these other organizations, and in recognition of the unique nature of
the task of bank resolution. Parliament gave the BSA an open-ended budget for
rescue operations. Furthermore, politicians left most of the implementation to
technocrats.

•

The upfront recognition of expected losses. Two strategies were initially
considered: one involving deferring losses and gradually writing off the loss making
assets using bank profits; the other rapid evaluation of the financial conditions of each
bank over a horizon of three-to five years, to estimate the capital shortage in banks—
a de facto stress test. Sweden took the latter approach to restore confidence quickly.

•

Bank classification. Based on the stress test results, the BSA grouped the banks into
three categories, Category A (strong banks with regulatory capital adequacy ratio
above eight percent), Category B (banks whose regulatory capital adequacy ratio
could temporary fall below eight percent), and Category C (nonviable banks to be
resolved).

•

Bad bank strategy. The government took control of a Category C bank (Gota Bank)
and splits their assets between good and bad assets. The evaluation of assets was
assisted by the Valuation Board (a body of expert auditors set up by the BSA) and
carried out purposefully to err on the side of undervaluation—but this valuation of
these assets by the BSA set floor prices in the market, contributing to maintaining
market liquidity (Ingves and Lind 2008, and Jonung, 2009). The bad assets were
transferred to an asset management company, established for each of the troubled
banks. The bad-bank approach was considered to be most cost efficient mainly
because it allowed specialization in the associated tasks.

5.
In sum, the essence of the Swedish model was its comprehensive and systematic
nature. Sweden legislated a special bank resolution bill, which gave the authorities power to
evaluate the financial condition of troubled banks in a forward looking manner, to force bank
shareholders to recapitalize banks; and if necessary to take control, including nationalization.
Parliament also authorized the BSA to provide an unlimited guarantee to the banking system,
and political influence in the individual bank workouts was successfully held at arms length.

59
End of the banking crisis
6.
As soon as early 1993, confidence in the financial system began recovering. The
financial position of the banks stabilized, with profitability and assert quality improved and
loan losses decreased. At the beginning of 1993, Swedbank and SEB entered into discussions
with BSA about the possible rescue plan, but subsequently, their financial difficulties were
solved without public assistance as their shareholders injected additional capital. Through the
resolution period, overt disruption in the financial system was avoided, though credit
volumes dropped sharply.
7.
Four major banks availed themselves of the government rescue package. Most of
the government’s assistance was concentrated in two of them, Nordbanken and Gota Bank,

and their associated asset management

companies (Securum and Retriva,
respectively).

8.
In total, the government’s
commitment amounted to SKr
88 billion (5 percent of GDP),9 and the
government initially anticipated that
the resolution operations would take
10 to 15 years (Attachment II Table 2).
However, not all government guarantees
committed were paid out, and total
budgetary costs of rescue measures were
smaller at SKr 65 billion (4 percent of
GDP). In addition, much of these costs
were later recovered through dividend
payments, privatization receipts, and
sales of bad assets at prices higher than
anticipated.

9.
In July 1996, the government announced the end of the banking crisis. It annulled
the 1992 bank resolution bill, removed the blanket guarantee, and dissolved the BSA
(transformed to the Deposit Guarantee Board).
C. Discussion
10.
The usual summary of the essence of the Swedish model greatly oversimplifies a
much richer picture. Furthermore, key issues in assessing the implications of that model for
9

GDP is an average for 1993-96.

60
global policymakers now—was it the small size of the underlying financial sector credit
losses, the macroeconomic content, or the financial sector stabilization policies which
underlay “success?”—have to be carefully considered.
Two years elapsed before decisive action.
11.
The initial signs of financial system strain emerged in Autumn 1990, but until the end
of 1992 (the passage of the bank resolution bill), the government relied on ad-hoc individual
bank support measures. Nonetheless, this time lag was shorter than elsewhere (e.g. Japan in
the 1990s) and, in retrospect, intervention came quickly enough to contain crisis, as reflected
in the absence of disruption in the banking system disruption and modest fiscal costs. In
addition, to bridge the gap between diagnosis and resolution, the government also introduced
a blanket guarantee, which sustained market confidence in the interim.
Nationalization was not the centerpiece, while the bad bank approach proved effective.
12.
Only one bank, Gota Bank, was nationalized. The other troubled bank, Nordbanken
(Category B), was already partially owned by the government prior to the onset of the crisis.
13.
The bad bank strategy worked well for the efficient recovery of bad assets. The
relatively homogeneous nature of those assets (mainly bank loans related to commercial
property development and residential mortgages) apparently helped rapid valuation. The
amount of bad assets to be transferred to a bad bank was carefully calibrated to ensure a level
playing field between troubled (Category C) banks and other healthier banks. An immediate
sale of bad assets was considered to be more costly given the risks of fire sale at very low
prices and lack of securitization markets in Sweden at that time (Thomas 1998).
Transparency served well and regulatory forbearance was avoided.
14.
The transparent upfront recognition of loan losses, based on the purposefully cautious
assessment of expert auditors, helped allay markets concerns and restore confidence in the
banking system promptly.
The modest scale of underlying credit losses may have allowed a bold and transparent
strategy to work.
15.
The Swedish crisis was smaller than many others. Nonperforming loans peaked at
13 percent of total loans in Sweden, compared to the average of 25 percent for a sample of 42
crisis episodes (Laevan and Valencia, 2008). Gross fiscal costs totaled just 4 percent of GDP
in Sweden, and after dividend payments and privatization receipts, net costs were much

61
smaller.10 By contrast, other countries bore much higher fiscal costs. The larger scale
elsewhere may have been key in impeding decisive and transparent intervention.

The macroeconomic environment may have underpinned successful bank resolution.
16.
Fear of a full blown twin crisis--balance of payments and banking--in mid 1992
prompted comprehensive macroeconomic adjustment, with measures going well beyond the
banking sector. Following the abandonment of the fixed exchange regime, the Krona
depreciated more than 30 percent in 1993. Monetary policy was eased, and interest rates fell,
supporting aggregate demand. On the fiscal front, the authorities consolidated, including:
tighter rules on transfers to households, increases in income taxes, social security fees, and
employee payroll taxes, all aimed at achieving fiscal balance.
17.
With these policy shifts, Sweden also reaped the benefits of an ongoing global
economic recovery around 1992-93. The exchange rate devaluation improved external
competitiveness, and with strong global demand, exports quickly rebounded in early 1993,
and GDP growth resumed from the middle of 1993 (Appendix II Figure 2). In contrast,
despite substantial measures taken in the banking sector, bank lending did not recover until
the middle of 1995. This suggests that economic recovery helped banking resolution, rather
than vice versa.
D. Lessons from the earlier experience for global—and Swedish—policymakers now
18.
Determination of the appropriate lapse of time before decisive fundamental
corrective action is taken should balance two considerations—difficulties should not
fester overlong, but adequate time for diagnosis and preparation is required. It is
notable that the lapse of time between Fall 2007, when the current global crisis broke out,
10

50%

60%

62
and now, is shorter than the lapse of time before decisive action in Sweden in the 1990s.
From that perspective, global policymakers have moved promptly in the current context.
19.
Blanket guarantees can play a useful role in bridging the lapse of time between
diagnosis and action, when they are credible. Credibility requires both strong fiscal
backing, political will, and an exit strategy—in particular to ensure that they do not
accommodate undue delay in corrective action. Though the EU has now abjured their
explicit use on competition grounds, implicit guarantees are widely perceived and have
achieved similar stabilizing effects. This lesson from Sweden appears, to that extent, to have
been learned. And while many decisive corrective steps have been taken globally, it remains
to be seen if the premium on avoiding undue delay in corrective action is fully reflected in
policy now.
20.
Similarly, liquidity provision to troubled banking systems can be key to
preserving stability, but may also thereby inadvertently impede consensus building on
measures to correct the underlying problems. Sweden in the 1990s was able to
circumvent this problem because the macroeconomic stress signals were so transparent that
political will for strong action was roused promptly—and action to restructure banks was
tied to those macroeconomic coat-tails. Globally, now, similar factors may appear to be at
work with macroeconomic stress indicators prompting calls for substantial change in
banking practices. But, as above, it again remains to be seen if, like Sweden in the
early 1990s, those calls for change can be effectively channeled into action to remedy the
underlying problems in the financial sector.
21.
Context also appears to be critical. Though in the heat of the moment, the size of
underlying credit losses is typically poorly known (indeed, that is often a key root of crisis),
a crisis with small underlying credit losses will clearly be more manageable. In that sense,
the Swedish experience does not afford clear lessons for all other cases: where the
underlying losses are much greater, acting decisively and transparently would be a greater
challenge.
22.
As particular examples of the role of contextual issues, consider which assets
should be transferred into bad banks, and at what price. The former requires detailed
“bottom up” information about loan portfolios, which is not always available quickly,
especially if banking sector problems are widespread across many asset classes and
institutions, rather than, as in the earlier Swedish case, concentrated in domestic commercial
and residential estate. And all authorities facing financial sector emergencies face conundra
with pricing of assets—be it plummeting real estate prices in 1990s Sweden, or structured
assets for which markets have disappeared now. But whereas the Swedish 1990s case
suggests the benefits of purposeful low-pricing of bad assets, to identify capital shortages
robustly and drive efforts to fill those gaps, it is striking that in the present global crisis,
neither the Swedish nor the global authorities have taken that approach. At least as concerns
their stress testing, central estimates of losses are reported in each scenario, rather than the

63
losses one or two standard deviations below the central estimates for each of the stress
scenarios that are considered. This approach may be holding back efforts to drive capital
raising efforts now.
23.
And the apparently dominant role of macroeconomic imbalances in the genesis
and resolution of the 1990s Swedish banking crisis may also qualify broader
applicability of the remedial measures for the financial sector used in Sweden then. In
essence, macroeconomic policies (including depreciation) rather than bank resolution
actions may have been largely responsible for the earlier Swedish success, and the bank
restructuring elements may not be so applicable in other contexts. On the other hand, if the
global economy recovers soon, the context for resolving global financial sector strains will
be greatly eased. Perhaps an implication from Sweden in the 1990s is that macroeconomic
problems have to be addressed before those targeting the financial sector can be fully
effective, whether or not the financial sector was at the root of the macroeconomic
difficulties.
24.
The 1990s Swedish experience also yields negative lessons. The abolition of the
special bank resolution framework after the crisis ended left Sweden unprepared for strains
which emerged following the Fall of 2007. Furthermore, the difficulties in the regulatory
framework, which had contributed in part to the genesis of the problem, remained even
though they were identified by an official review which followed the crisis.
25.
This raises a fundamental question for global policymakers—to understand
why lessons which are learned during a crisis are then forgotten. The 1990s Swedish
case seems to underscore clearly that as crisis eases, political focus moves elsewhere. This
seems to imply that actions to correct long-run weaknesses in the financial stability
framework should be taken immediately, even while efforts are focused on containing the
immediate crisis. In the case of Sweden now, this consideration points to urgent need to
reform the resourcing arrangements for the supervisor.
26.
And even so, in light of current Swedish banking strains, the final implication
for global policymakers suggested by the 1990s Swedish case is that “never again” is a
hope too far. Banking and financial crises will recur.

ATTACHMENT III. SHOULD THE FISCAL RULE REMAIN?1
1.
Since its introduction in 2000, the fiscal rule has played a key role underpinning
Sweden’s fiscal framework. The main fiscal target is to achieve a general government
surplus of 1 percent of GDP over the business cycle. Achievement of this objective is
supported by expenditure ceilings (three years ahead) for central government outlays
(excluding interest payments) and social security spending and by a requirement that local
governments maintain balanced budgets. The framework aims at strengthening public
finances to provide a buffer to cope with economic fluctuations and the impact of
demographic changes to ensure long-term fiscal sustainability and intergenerational
fairness.
2.
To avoid problems in precisely dating business cycles (especially ex-ante), the
Swedish authorities have adopted three indicators to assess actual budget performance
relative to the fiscal target. These indicators are (i) the average overall budget balance
since 2000, the year in which the target was first applied; (ii) a seven-year rolling average of
the overall budget balance centered on the current year; and (iii) the structural overall budget
balance, the budget balance adjusted for cyclical and other one-off and temporary effects.
3.
The firm implementation of the framework has contributed to Sweden’s strong fiscal
performance in recent years. Excluding 2002 and 2003, when the economy was affected by a
global economic slowdown, the overall budget balance has consistently been in surplus. As a
result, public debt declined from 65 percent of GDP in 1999 to 38 percent of GDP in 2008.
The strong fiscal performance has been achieved primarily through expenditure reduction
rather than higher taxes. Lower social transfers, reflecting a tightening of criteria for sickness
and disability payments, were a key contributing factor. In addition, lower interest payments
have contributed. The nominal expenditure ceilings, introduced in 1997, also have played a
role in restraining spending growth; since being introduced, they have been consistently met.

To evaluate the performance of the
fiscal rule, simulations are conducted using
a two-country “New Keynesian” model
with rational expectations.2 The model is
estimated for 1993Q1-2008Q4 with
Bayesian estimates of the parameters. In the
simulations, the model is subject to various
dynamic stochastic shocks. Each set of
model simulations consists of 1500
simulations that last for 200 quarters.

The first set of simulations suggest

that when the automatic stabilizers are
allowed to operate fully without any
discretionary policy, on average, the 1 percent of GDP fiscal surplus target is met over the
business cycle. 95 percent of the time the cumulative debt at the end of each cycle would be
within ±4 percentage points of GDP of the debt level consistent with attaining the target
precisely over each cycle. However, this does not necessarily ensure long-term sustainability
of the fiscal position. The small deviation in debt levels over each cycle could cumulate
resulting in a substantial deviation in debt to GDP away from what might be sustainable.
6.
Because of the problems in estimating the intensity and duration of each business
cycle ex- ante and the need to assess long-term sustainability, a second set of simulations test
the performance of the 7-year rolling average indicator. Simulations suggest this indicator is
appropriate, especially since the model suggests that the average length of business cycles in
Sweden has been close to 7 years. In these simulations, under the full operation of the
automatic stabilizers only, 95 percent of the time the indicator is within ±0.5 percent of GDP
with 0 average, while the cumulative debt at the end of each simulation (50 years ahead)
would be within ±8 percentage points of GDP of the debt level consistent with attaining the
target precisely over the simulation period. This is well within plausible tolerance limits.
7.
However, Sweden is a small open economy, and its sensitivity to external shocks is
enhanced by its relatively large banking sector with significant cross-boarder exposure.
Accordingly, a case might be made for building a safety margin into any indicator used as a
guide for achieving the fiscal target. In a third set of simulations, a small discretionary fiscal
adjustment (½ percent of GDP) is introduced in periods when the economy is above trend
and expected to remain so over the succeeding three years. Accordingly, in these simulations,

2

69
on average the level of debt is 8 percentage points lower at the end of the simulations,
eliminating the concern of a debt drift.

However, the intensity of the current
economic downturn lies well outside the range of
average historical experience. For example,
historically the 95 percent confidence interval
for Sweden’s output gap is ±3½ percent. Staff
projects the output gap during the current
downturn will reach and remain large at about
9 percent for the next few years. Clearly, the
current situation can be considered to be a “tail
event”.

9.
In these circumstances, even if the only
fiscal action is to allow automatic stabilizers to operate, both the cumulative average surplus
and the 7-year rolling average indicators are expected to deviate substantially from the target
over the next 5 years. In addition, uncertainties regarding estimates of the output gap at
present and going forward make it difficult to estimate the structural budget balance with any
kind of reasonable degree of confidence. And finally, trying to meet the fiscal rule could be
highly procyclical.

This situation raises two questions:

What is the appropriate fiscal policy?

•

What is the appropriate indicator to monitor fiscal performance?

Appropriate fiscal policy
11.
Reflecting the high tax burden in Sweden and a generous social safety net, the
automatic stabilizers—the budgetary impact of a given change in output—are relatively
large. The most recent OECD estimates (OECD 2005) of the impact of a 1 percent change in
output on the budget balance as a percent of GDP (semi-elasticity) is 0.55 for Sweden,
compared to an OECD average of 0.44 and an Euro area average of 0.48. In addition, Flodén
(2009) estimates the budget elasticity including active labor market measures, the recent cuts
in income tax, and regular unemployment benefits shows that automatic stabilizers have
remained broadly unchanged at 0.62. Further he finds no clear evidence that the elasticity in
Sweden has declined during the last decade (see Text Figures).

12.
At the same time, the impact on the economy of discretionary fiscal measures in
Sweden tends to be small. Estimates of the fiscal multipliers for Sweden using the 2-country

and Fiscal model3 suggest that a temporary

permanent reduction in labor income taxes would only boost output by 0.35 percent in the
first year. In contrast, being small and open implies Sweden benefits from measures
introduced in the rest of the world. A temporary 1 percent increase in public investment in
the rest of the world boosts Sweden’s output by 0.6.
13.
With stabilizers large and multipliers small, the case for discretionary fiscal action is
attenuated. Furthermore, long-term sustainability issues and current risks associated with
contingent liabilities in the banking sector counsel further caution.
•

The outlook for productivity growth and potential output is unclear. With a
substantial range of uncertainty around estimates of the structural balance, it is
difficult to correctly assess the consistency of the current stance with the fiscal rule.

•

Political difficulty in adjusting pensions during downturns in accordance with
Sweden’s defined-contribution plan financed on a pay-as-you-go basis raises a
concern about the sustainability of the pension fund.

•

The government at present faces considerable contingent liabilities owing to both
explicit and implicit guarantees provided to the banking system arising in particular
from the banks’ exposures in the Baltics. The heightened risk calls for keeping the
fiscal powder dry.
14.
Finally, once the uncertainty surrounding Sweden’s growth potential and the
cyclical position is reduced, the surplus target will need to be reviewed to ensure long-term
sustainability can be maintained.

Appropriate monitoring
15.
The key question in the short term is how to try to ensure that there is not a
significant deterioration in the underlying fiscal position during this period when it is
difficult to measure that position and when using the rolling average and the cumulative
budget deficit measures to assess policy could misstate the underlying position. One way to
prevent a drift in the fiscal balance would be to retain the expenditure ceiling. However, any
discretionary cuts in taxes would have to be offset by equal downward adjustments in the
expenditure ceilings.
16.
Given the current circumstances, a further extension could be to use the expenditure
ceiling as a “guideline” and not as a strict limit. Strictly adhering to the ceiling in the event
the recession is worse and more protracted than envisaged could impede the working of the
automatic stabilizers on the expenditure side. Also, since the ceiling covers only central
government spending, there could be an incentive to meet it by cutting transfers to local
governments, compounding procyclical fiscal policy as these entities are required to meet
balanced budgets. If this possible “softening” of the ceiling was adopted, any important

72
deviation from the ceiling would need to be accounted for in a transparent fashion. On the
other hand, if there is a high risk that a breach of the ceiling could seriously undermine the
credibility of the fiscal framework, there may be a case for strictly observing the ceilings.
The Fiscal Council could play a useful role in publicly monitoring compliance with the
letter and the spirit of the fiscal framework.

ATTACHMENT IV: FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY
Baseline scenario
In the baseline scenario, the underlying fiscal position is projected to improve slightly over
the medium-term to about ¼ percent of GDP reflecting the impact of recent reforms to
reduce welfare expenditures. After the cyclical downturns expected for 2009-2011, the public
debt-to-GDP ratio declines from a high 53.4 percent of GDP in 2012 to 49.4 percent of GDP
in 2014. With a primary surplus of about 1½ percent of GDP and a declining public debt
ratio in 2014, Sweden’s fiscal position is expected to remain strong.
In the alternative scenarios, a one time shock to contingent liabilities and lower-thanexpected output growth constitute key risks to the baseline scenario. Given the relatively low
level of public debt (38 percent of GDP in 2008) in the context of strong fiscal performance
in recent years, the impact of higher interest rate is projected to be small. In addition, the
portion of the government’s liabilities denominated in foreign currencies is small
at 20 percent share, which would imply a modest impact from a sudden depreciation in the
real exchange rate. A confluence of shocks—lower growth, higher real interest rates and
weaker primary balance—would pose some threats to the debt reduction plan but the impact
would remain modest at about 4 percent of GDP.
External risks
•

The impact of a permanent ½ standard-deviation shock to the interest rate—a
0.7 percentage point increase from the baseline—would increase public debt by
2 percentage points to 51 percent of GDP in 2014.

•

A one-time 30 percent depreciation in the REER (in 2010) would immediately
increase public debt but the impact is not large, by about 4 percentage points to
53.2 percent of GDP. Debt would subsequently fall at a pace envisaged in the
baseline to 53.2 percent of GDP in 2014.

•

A one-time 10 percent of GDP shock to contingent liabilities (in 2010) would
increase public debt to 55.2 percent of GDP. Assuming the baseline case of speed of
debt reduction thereafter, public debt would lower to 58.7 percent of GDP in 2014
(about 10 percent of GDP higher than the baseline).

Domestic risks
•

A ½ standard deviation shock to primary balance, which lowers primary balance by
nearly 1 percent of GDP each year during the forecast period, would translate into a
more gradual debt reduction going forward. Debt in 2014 would be higher by
4½ percentage points of GDP (to 54 percent of GDP) in 2014 relative to the baseline.

74

•

A ½ standard deviation shock to growth would bring average projected annual
growth down by 0.8 percent. The impact on public debt is substantial, rising it to
57 percent of GDP in 2014 due to adverse debt dynamics.

•

One-quarter standard deviation shocks to growth, real interest rate, and primary
balance (i.e., compared to the baseline, lowering output growth by 0.4 percent a year,
raising real interest rate by 0.35 percent a year, and reducing the primary balance by
½ percent of GDP a year) would bring public debt to 53.4 percent of GDP in 2014—
an increase of 4 percentage points of GDP from the baseline.

Public sector balance sheet
Despite the weaker underlying fiscal position over the medium-term reflecting fiscal
measures, Sweden’s current fiscal policies remain sustainable over the long-run. Sweden,
like most industrialized countries, faces significant challenges associated with population
aging that have significant budgetary implications. However, the projected increase in
spending with aging (2.6 percent of GDP) is relatively small compared to other European
countries (5.2 percent in the euro area). Using a public sector balance sheet approach to
calculate the long-run intertemporal financial position based on the staff baseline scenario
suggests that the net worth constraint continues to be met by 2060, albeit with a smaller
margin to absorb upside risks to the aging costs.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
July 22, 2009
1.
This statement contains information that has become available since the Staff Report
was circulated to the Executive Board on June 30, 2009. This information does not alter
the staff’s board assessment of policy issues and recommendations contained in the staff
report.
2.
Recent economic indicators provide mixed signals regarding prospects for recovery in
the near-term. Euro values for merchandise exports and imports, as well as industrial
production have continued to decline—falling 33, 35, and 22 percent respectively in the
twelve months to May—but data on new foreign and domestic orders, though still at a low
ebb, appear to have stopped falling.
3.
In this context, the Riksbank has revised its baseline forecast since it was last
published in April (paragraph 61 of the staff report). It now projects a 5.4 percent reduction
in real GDP in 2009—about 1 percentage point weaker than in April—on account of both,
lower domestic demand and weaker anticipated recovery in key export markets. This brings
the forecast closer to the staff’s assessment (paragraph 31 and Table 2 of the staff report).
4.
In part reflecting this revision, the Riksbank lowered its policy rate by
0.25 percentage points to 0.25 percent on July 1. As a result, bank deposits at the Riksbank
now earn a modestly negative nominal interest rate, though such balances are normally
modest as excess funds are typically absorbed in a weekly repo auction. The Riksbank has
forecast that repo rate will remain at 0.25 percent until the autumn of 2010.
5.
In addition, the Riksbank has supported the signal inherent in the policy rate cut by
providing up to SEK 100 billion in fixed rate loans to banks at a 12 month maturity (see
Paragraph 65 in the staff report). The associated auction on July 13 was oversubscribed with
the rate set at a premium of 20 basis points over the policy rate.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2009 Article IV Consultation with
Sweden
On July 22, 2009 the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Sweden. 1
Background
Sweden has been hit hard by the global financial crisis. Two of its banks built up large
exposures in the Baltics that significantly increased loan losses beyond normal recessionary
levels. Liquidity crunched in the wake of dysfunctional wholesale funding markets on which
these banks increasingly relied, and extensive public guarantees only partly mitigated market
unease about their capital adequacy. Sweden was particularly vulnerable to the global
recession that followed the crisis given the dominance of its output bundle by investment goods
and consumer durables. Exports turned sharply negative in the fourth quarter after weakening
throughout 2008, and with investment following them down, this led to large reductions in
economic activity and inflation. Driven in part by increased risk perception, the Swedish krona
depreciated substantially, albeit, to the extent that the composition of global demand that
favored Swedish exports during the recent boom was temporary, this depreciation has probably
resulted in only a modest undervaluation.
In response to the crisis, the authorities have taken wide-ranging measures to stabilize the
financial system and support demand. The measures included expansion of Riksbank’s lending
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

facilities, often at lengthened maturities at fixed interest rates and via extension of the eligible
collateral; expanded deposit and credit guarantees; and a new bank recapitalization scheme.
Considerable policy stimulus has also been injected into the real economy. A decisive relaxation
of the monetary policy stance led by a reduction in the policy rate to ¼ percent has recently
been complemented by the imposition of a penalty on banks’ excess reserves at the Riksbank’s
deposit facility. On the fiscal side, full operation of large automatic stabilizers and a discretionary
budget loosening for 2009 is underway taking the budget from a surplus of 2½ percent in 2008
to a deficit of 4 percent in 2009.
These steps have supported the economy and helped address downside tail risks, but
prospects for recovery are very much dependent on developments abroad. If global demand for
Sweden’s output bundle recovers slowly relative to other components, Sweden could have a
late exit out of the current recession. Staff projects the economy to contract by 6 percent in
2009, with a modest recovery beginning in the middle of 2010.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that the Swedish economy has been relatively harder hit by the global
crisis, owing to its export composition and the regional role of Swedish banks. Directors
welcomed the authorities’ prompt and appropriate policy responses, which have allayed
immediate concerns with financial sector stability, and helped cushion domestic demand.
Immediate prospects for recovery are, however, highly dependent upon developments abroad,
and downside risks remain. Accordingly, Directors encouraged the authorities to adapt their
integrated policy response as necessary to this testing environment.
Directors considered securing confidence in financial sector stability to be a key immediate task,
given the impact of recession on asset quality and Swedish banks’ exposure to Baltic
economies. While recent stress tests indicated that regulatory capital requirements would
continue to be met by all major institutions, market doubts persist. Thus, steps to strengthen
banks further—including raising private capital where necessary—should be undertaken as
soon as possible. Where private capital proves insufficient, public investment—at prices
ensuring protection of taxpayer interests—alongside implementation of a bad-bank model, could
be considered. Directors encouraged the authorities to review the current toolkit of supervisory
intervention as part of contingency planning, with increases in the Financial Supervisory
Agency’s capacity. It would also be important to continue efforts to strengthen coordinated
cross-border financial oversight and crisis resolution mechanisms.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ aggressive monetary easing, noting that inflation
expectations remain well anchored in low, but positive, territory. Further immediate steps into
quantitative easing should remain under review, ready for use should risk of sustained deflation
rise.
Directors noted the staff assessment that the krona is probably modestly undervalued. Recent
steps to raise international reserves, combined with swap arrangements with other central
banks, will boost the Riksbank’s capacity to respond to financial sector liquidity stresses.

3
Directors endorsed the significant fiscal stimulus provided by the 2009 budget, notably via full
play of the large fiscal stabilizers and the planned discretionary measures—which has been
made possible by Sweden’s strong fiscal performance in recent years. The composition of the
discretionary component would assist supply-side efficiencies. Directors considered that further
fiscal stimulus should be weighed carefully reflecting the importance of maintaining fiscal
sustainability and recognizing the uncertainties about the public debt burden resulting from
financial sector fragilities. Most Directors did not see a need for additional discretionary fiscal
action at present. In this context, Directors suggested that the current fiscal rules should be
retained, and many Directors considered that the nominal spending ceilings could be supported
by a new commitment allowing for adjustments to the spending ceilings that offset the revenue
impact of any further discretionary tax reforms.

Statement by Jens Olof Henriksson, Executive Director for Sweden
July 22, 2009
On behalf of my Swedish authorities, I would like to convey their appreciation to staff for
constructive discussions in Stockholm and for a well written report.
The Swedish authorities broadly agree with staff’s overall assessment of the Swedish
economy. The Swedish economy exhibits sound long-term prospects but is currently in a deep
recession. The authorities also agree with the view that monetary and fiscal policy have been
well designed for dealing with the current crisis: an accommodating monetary policy and
strong automatic stabilizers at full play together with additional fiscal measures in line with
the European Union Recovery Plan and specific labor market policies to avoid unemployment
persistence. Staff concludes that policy actions have strengthened confidence but should
continue to aim at minimizing the downturn of the Swedish economy. The authorities agree
with the view that strengthening the financial sector is of particular importance. Staff
furthermore expresses concerns regarding the developments of public finances and the
financial market as well as the surveillance of the financial market. These concerns are partly
shared by the authorities.
Near term outlook and risks
The authorities agree with staff’s broad near term picture of the Swedish economy, i.e. that
the Swedish economy has been hard hit by the current crisis and that it will take time for the
economy to recover. But also that many factors, including the expansionary fiscal and
monetary policies, strong automatic stabilizers and the flexible characteristics of the economy,
have helped cushion the downturn. The authorities believe that these same factors will also
contribute to turn around the economy.
The main differences between staff and the authorities regarding the near term macro outlook
concern the economy’s recovery dynamics where the authorities have a somewhat more
optimistic view on output growth and the support from global growth. Staff’s forecasts of
GDP and output gaps are on average more pessimistic than those of the authorities. Staff’s
forecasts include estimates of larger output gaps than the authorities in the near term. This
difference may be due to differences in estimates of both actual and potential GDP. It may
also be due to a difference in methodology regarding trend forecasting, i.e. estimates of
potential GDP.
The authorities agree with staff that potential output has been adversely affected by the crisis.
Staff suggests that potential output has decreased mainly due to a permanent change in
demand for Swedish exports. The authorities recognise the concern of staff about Sweden’s
heavy dependence on export developments and the fact that the composition of Swedish
exports is rather unfavourable at the present juncture. However, the authorities have a more
optimistic view of the developments of exports than staff, and - actually - already during the
last two months export orders have increased and the Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) for
Sweden is now back in the area of growth and well above the PMI both in the USA and the
EU. Staff similarly has a more pessimistic forecast for imports. Despite both forecasts of
lower imports and lower exports, forecasts for net exports and the current account are lower
than those of the authorities. Staff forecasts higher inflation during 2009 and 2010. With
regard to final domestic demand and unemployment, staff’s forecasts are, on the other hand,
generally more optimistic than those of the authorities.

The authorities agree with staff that the Swedish krona is likely to appreciate somewhat in the
years to come. However, staff suggests that the weakening of Swedish exports due to the
downturn of global demand and the composition of Swedish exports combined with
weakening net factor income have lowered the equilibrium real exchange rate.
The authorities largely agree with the view concerning both the downside and upside risks
and have considered these in various alternative scenarios in different reports and bills.
However, the household sector or the weakening housing and property markets are not
regarded as considerable risks. According to stress tests of the household sector carried out by
the Riksbank, the Swedish households’ debt servicing ability is only slightly affected by
increased unemployment. These stress tests show that households in general have the capacity
to manage an economic downturn, with rising unemployment and higher interest rates. Lower
house prices do not automatically mean that the household sector constitutes a threat to
financial stability, as the effects are likely to be contained and households still will be able to
pay off their loans.
Financial sector policy and framework
Sweden has in accordance with the European Council Conclusions from October 2008
implemented a framework for dealing with problems in financial institutions and for restoring
confidence in the financial markets. The legal framework includes a possibility to give
support to troubled credit institutions, an increase and widening of the deposit guarantee, a
guarantee scheme for bank borrowing and a recapitalization scheme to support lending. The
National Debt Office has been appointed as Support Authority. As a result, an acute
confidence crisis has successfully been avoided.
The authorities are prepared for possible further negative outcomes. Fragilities have been
assessed, as concluded by staff, in thorough stress tests by the authorities, and contingency
plans have been developed and discussed by the Standing Committee consisting of the
Ministry of Finance, the Riksbank, the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority
(Finansinspektionen), and the Swedish National Debt Office (Riksgälden). The banks’
operations in the Baltic countries continue to be a cause of concern. Lending to the Baltic
countries accounts for a non-trivial part of total lending for two of the Swedish banks. The
risk of a sharp macroeconomic deterioration in these countries has now materialised.
However, stress tests show that the banks should be able to stay above minimum required Tier
1 ratios even if the situation were to further deteriorate in the Baltic countries.
Notwithstanding, in line with staff’s conclusion, market concerns about the banks’ resilience
will probably require banks to raise more capital. Such action would also reduce risks of
curbed credit supply. In case the banks are not able to raise capital on their own, they can
apply for capital in the recapitalization scheme.
The government agrees that it is important that the supervisory authority has adequate
resources. The Swedish FSA has continuously been given increased resources from the
government during the past years. For both 2008 and 2009 the resources were increased by
more than 10 percent. It is, however, also important that the supervisory authority has the
right focus. The Swedish Agency for Public Management (Statskontoret) - on commission of
the Swedish government - has reviewed the operations of the Swedish FSA and come to the
conclusion that additional resources are not a priority, but there are other issues, primarily

governance issues, that need attention. The government is currently considering what the next
step should be.
The FSA does indeed play an important role in a banking crisis situation, and also in the
continued supervision of a bank subject to authority measures. However, the FSA cannot be
expected to handle all issues related to crisis management. Therefore, the government has
appointed the National Debt Office as Support Authority.
Fiscal policy and framework
The government broadly agrees with staff’s view of the fiscal position and the appropriate
fiscal policy stance in the current economic situation.
Sweden entered the downturn in robust fiscal health and as staff points out the government’s
commitment to the budgetary rules − the surplus target and the nominal expenditure ceiling −
is here a key factor. The deep recession does not change the government’s view of the need to
adhere to these targets. One basis of the government's policy in the severe recession is
keeping public finances in good order to ensure that the deficits are temporary and
manageable. In this way, households and firms can continue to have confidence in economic
policy and the foundation on which welfare rests.
The initial strong fiscal position has permitted the government to let the automatic stabilisers
operate fully besides leaving room for some additional discretionary measures. Along with the
measures presented since the 2009 Budget Bill, the government is allocating a total of SEK 45
billion in 2009 (1.5 percent of GDP) and SEK 60 billion in 2010 (2 percent of GDP) in
response to the crisis. Besides structural tax cuts, these measures include increased
municipality grants, preventing the municipalities to act pro-cyclically, and increased
resources to the labor market, preventing people from becoming long-term unemployed and
improving conditions for those most detached from the labor market. The size of the
discretionary package is fully in accordance with the European Union Recovery Plan. Similar
to staff’s projections, the fiscal stimulus − discretionary measures and automatic stabilisers
taken together - is one of the largest in the EU.
Even if the government’s view is that the fiscal position is strong in the long-term and the
government’s ambition is to keep deficits temporary and manageable, it must be underscored
that the development of the budget balance in the near future is highly uncertain due to the
crisis, which staff also points out. Tax revenues have fallen dramatically due to the economic
downturn and the strong automatic stabilisers make the budget balance very sensitive to a
more prolonged recession. In addition, there is no guarantee that the budget balance
automatically reaches the surplus target when the economic situation becomes more
favourable. This relates in part to the fact that the crisis may affect potential output in a
negative way. The government agrees with the conclusion that policy decisions, in this highly
uncertain situation, should not rely only on estimates of the structural budget balance, but also
on close monitoring of the development of the actual budget balance. As staff points out,
plausible estimates of potential output yield widely varying estimates of the structural balance
and the fiscal outlook. In addition, as staff also points out, it is unclear how much public debt
will rise due to financial sector rescue operations that may prove to be necessary.
The government will continue to closely monitor and examine the situation when making its
policy choices. The current assessment, in line with staff’s, is that there is very little room for

further reforms. The government will continue to tackle the crisis, weighing each measure for
the effects it will have on the jobs and the public finances.
Regarding the expenditure ceiling, staff suggests that it should be more closely linked to the
surplus target by allowing the ceiling to be adjusted if tax rates are cut after the ceiling has
been settled. The government agrees with staff that the principles for how the expenditure
ceiling is determined might be improved, but this involves a lot of difficulties that need to be
more closely looked into. The issue, together with the formulation of the surplus target, is
currently under review.
Monetary policy and framework
The Riksbank welcomes staff’s conclusion that the Riksbank is one of the most transparent
central banks, that the transparency has increased credibility and enhanced communication,
and that its inflation targeting framework has worked well. This is indeed an aim that is given
high priority by the Riksbank. The Riksbank agrees with staff that in the aftermath of the
crisis it will be necessary to evaluate the functioning of the framework as well as the
effectiveness of the different policy actions taken.
The Riksbank also agrees with staff that the risks of sustained disinflation in the Swedish
economy are low and that monetary policy can and should currently focus on mitigating the
downturn as well as on enhancing resilience to any additional shocks. Staff suggests that
monetary policy, conventional and unconventional, if needed, should remain aggressive.
According to the Riksbank’s latest forecast inflation will, during 2009, fall below the lower
bound of the target, remain within the bound of the target in 2010 and rise above the upper
bound of the target in 2011. Inflation expectations remain steady around the target in the long
run. At the last monetary policy meeting of the Riksbank the repo rate was cut to 0.25 percent
and the announced repo rate path was supported by the Riksbank offer of loans to the
monetary policy counterparties at a fixed interest rate and with a maturity of approximately 12
months. These actions are in line with staff suggestions concerning monetary policy.
Staff expresses concerns regarding the foreign reserves and although the Riksbank has
recently raised its reserves by SEK 100 billion, and has swap agreements with both the
Federal Reserve and the ECB, staff sees a need for further strengthening of reserves. This is,
according to staff, motivated by possible banking sector liquidity stress and possible spillover
effects on the krona. The Riksbank is currently not planning any further actions to strengthen
reserves and does not have an explicit target for the exchange rate.
Final note
I look forward to conveying the outcome of the Board discussion to my authorities. This will
complete the constructive dialogue in which they have been involved with the Fund’s staff
during this consultation. On behalf of the authorities, I also look forward to a fruitful
cooperation in the years to come. The authorities intend to authorize publication of the staff
report, in accordance with normal Fund procedures.
