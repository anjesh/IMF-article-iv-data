Staff Report for the 2005 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by Staff Representatives for the 2005 Consultation with Aruba
Approved by Alessandro Leipold and Martin Fetherston
April 8, 2005
The 2005 Article IV discussions were held in Oranjestad during January 12–19, 2005. The
staff team comprised Mr. Székely (head) and Mmes. Allard and Tsounta (all EUR). It met
with the governor, the prime minister, the finance minister, the president, and other
representatives of the Central Bank of Aruba (CBA), the senior staff of several ministries and
government agencies, and representatives of labor unions, employer organizations, and the
banking association. Mr. Roovers (Senior Advisor to the Executive Director) attended the
meetings.
In concluding the 2002 Article IV Consultation on February 24, 2003, Executive Directors
commended Aruba’s economic performance during the 1990s but expressed concern about
the deteriorating budgetary position. They encouraged the authorities to strengthen financial
system surveillance and improve statistics.
As part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, Aruba has accepted the obligations under Article
VIII and, apart from the foreign exchange tax described in the text and certain security
restrictions, maintains an exchange system free of restrictions (Appendix I).
The authorities held a joint press conference on the mission’s concluding statement and have
agreed to the publication of the staff report.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background: After a two-year long recession, GDP growth reached 1.4 percent in 2003, as
both tourism and investment picked up, and accelerated further to an estimated 3½ percent
in 2004. For 2005, growth is projected to level off at 3¼ percent, as hotel capacity constraints
slow tourism growth. After a spurt in 2002–03, inflation has come down to U.S. levels
in 2004, reflecting tight monetary conditions. The non-oil current account deficit reached
historic highs in mid-2003, but has narrowed significantly since then on the strength of
tourism. The fiscal deficit (including health care), however, remained high after the recession
and widened further in 2004 to an estimated 5½ percent of GDP. Public debt reached some
46 percent of GDP in 2004, up from 28½ percent in 2000.
Policy discussions centered on the interaction of policies and institutions and focused on
the following key issues:
• There was a consensus that ambitious fiscal consolidation would be needed to lower
public debt to a safer level, reducing Aruba’s vulnerability to external and internal shocks
and safeguard the credibility of the exchange rate peg. To secure this in a sustainable manner,
the authorities have implemented a reform of the public sector pension plan for new
members, made renewed efforts to reduce health care expenditure, and plan to offer
severance packages to selected groups of civil servants. Staff welcomed these measures and
recommended additional measures to rein in the wage bill, balance the health care budget,
and restore the solvency of the public sector pension scheme. Moreover, staff advocated a
medium-term fiscal framework and supported the initiative to adopt a fiscal responsibility
law to promote required fiscal consolidation.
• Meeting the challenges of population aging requires policies that create conditions
for faster productivity growth. To this end, the authorities have promoted diversification into
higher-value-added service industries, though with little success recently. Staff recommended
applying the successful model of public-private sector cooperation developed in the tourism
industry to promote diversification in other areas, in particular in financial services. The
authorities have also recognized the importance of improving labor skills to promote higher
labor productivity and of freeing up fiscal resources to improve public education. Noting that
the cost of postponing reforms is prohibitive, staff called on the authorities to take early
action on these fronts.
• Renewed efforts are needed to further improve the quality of public institutions.
Aruba’s impressive development in the 1990s is largely due to its early efforts to create highquality public institutions, but scant progress has been recorded recently. There was
agreement that the central bank law needed to be reviewed with a view to strengthening the
legal guarantees for central bank independence. Staff urged the authorities to speed up the
restructuring of public companies and reinvigorate their efforts to improve statistics.

I. BACKGROUND
1.
The economy is pulling out of its first postautonomy recession (Figure 1).
Similarly to other countries in the region, GDP declined by a cumulative 3.2 percent in
2001-02, caused by a series of external shocks (starting with the post-9/11 decline in tourism)
(Figure 2). Growth reached 1.4 percent in 2003, helped by the construction of a large hotel
and a rebound in oil processing (Tables 1 and 2).1 Tourism has been a particularly strong
engine of growth since early 2004, while construction and oil processing have remained
robust. Staff estimates growth at 3½ percent in 2004. Key characteristics of the Aruban
economy are described in Box 1.
2.
The fiscal deficit, however, has remained large, mostly reflecting health care and
wage expenditures (Table 4). The Health Care Fund (AZV) has repeatedly experienced
large spending overruns since the introduction of universal health care in 2001. Moreover,
despite a nominal freeze, total wage costs increased by a cumulative 12 percent in 2001–03,
reflecting a rapid increase in public sector employment. As a result, the deficit, including
AZV, widened by 2 percentage points, to 5½ percent of GDP in 2004, according to staff
estimates. Large deficits and called guarantees (issued to foreign investors over time and paid
in 2003 in an amount equivalent to 6 percent of GDP) sharply increased public debt from
28½ percent of GDP in 2000 to 41.7 percent in 2003. Reflecting these developments, Fitch
has recently reaffirmed its negative outlook on Aruba’s credit rating (BBB).
3.
Nevertheless, as a result of monetary tightening, inflation has been brought
down to the U.S. level. Strong domestic demand, fueled by double-digit private credit
growth and fiscal expansion, and a sharp increase in the oil price in 2002 had reignited
inflation, which peaked at about 4.3 percent in mid-2003. However, credit ceilings were
reintroduced in that year and subsequently tightened in 2004, enabling the CBA to slow
down private sector credit growth by September 2004 (Table 5). Average inflation fell to
2½ percent in 2004.
4.
The non-oil current account, which deteriorated sharply during the recession,
started to improve in the second half of 2003 as tourism picked up.2 Declining net
tourism revenue and robust import demand expanded the (rolling 12-month) non-oil deficit to

1

In the absence of proper price deflators, real GDP is calculated using the CPI, which does not capture the
fluctuations in tourism prices that has characterized the post-9/11 period. As a result, both the extent of the
decline in 2001–02 and that of the recovery in 2004 are likely to be overestimated.
2

The operations of a foreign-owned refinery, which reexports oil products, create large swings in the current
account, but these operations are financed directly by the owners from abroad. Staff, therefore, bases the
analysis of Aruba’s external position on the non-oil current account, which excludes the activities of the
refinery. As disaggregated national accounts data are not available, a complete macroeconomic framework,
including saving-investment balances, cannot be put together for the non-oil sector.

Box 1. Aruba
Aruba, which is part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, is a small Caribbean island with about
96,000 inhabitants (Box Table). The economy is highly dependent on tourism, mainly from the
United States, which generates about 43 percent of GDP in export revenues. Strong legal
institutions, good governance, and openness have brought the country stability and rapid
development since it gained autonomy (status aparte) in 1986. Aruba’s per capita GDP
($21,200) is one of the highest in the region and similar to that of the lower-income
Mediterranean members of the EU (Table 3). The overall level of social development is also
high compared with other Caribbean countries, but in some areas, Aruba lags behind its highincome comparators (Figure 3). Aruba’s development fund receives official aid from the
Netherlands, amounting to about ¾ percent of GDP in 2003. Reflecting Aruba’s success, net
immigration to the island has been sizable since 1986, mostly from poor countries in the region,
while net emigration to the Netherlands has been negligible.

almost 12 percent of GDP by mid-2003, a level not seen in Aruba in the previous decade
(Table 6). The deficit has narrowed subsequently with the strengthening of tourism revenue.
The debt-creating deficit (current account balance plus FDI), however, has been significantly
smaller and has improved faster than the headline current account deficit (Text Figure). The
Aruban florin, which has been pegged to the U.S. dollar since 1986, has appreciated against
the U.S. dollar by about 3 percent in real terms since 2001.

The present government of the People's Electoral Movement (MEP) took office
in 2001. The next parliamentary elections are scheduled for September 2005.
II. REPORT ON THE POLICY DISCUSSIONS
6.
In addition to assessing the short-term outlook and associated policy stance,
discussions focused on the interaction of policies and institutions. These covered three
key areas: (i) the need for medium-term fiscal consolidation and the fiscal framework that
can best promote it; (ii) the long-term implications of population aging; and (iii) the areas
where the quality of public institutions needs to be improved. There was consensus that the
short-term outlook is favorable but that the macroeconomic policy mix needs to be
rebalanced by tightening the fiscal stance, though the political economy environment of
approaching elections is not favorable. Over the medium term, the authorities recognized the
need for consolidating public finances and supporting reforms before aging set in. Box 2
summarizes the implementation of previous IMF recommendations.

-9-

Box 2. Implementation of Previous Recommendations
In the past five years, the IMF has advised Aruba to strengthen its public finances by
implementing expenditure reforms and broadening the tax base and simplifying its tax regime.
The Fund has also recommended strengthening the supervision and regulation of the onshore
and offshore financial sectors; increasing the operational independence of public companies;
and improving statistics. The authorities agreed with the recommendations, but progress in
implementation has been uneven.
Building on Fund technical assistance, the public sector pension scheme has been reformed for
new entrants, and measures have been taken to rein in the fast-increasing health care costs. The
civil service reform and the reform of the universal pension system, however, have been
postponed. The corporate income tax has been modernized, but no progress has been made
with simplifying the personal income tax and introducing a broad-based indirect tax. Financial
supervision and regulation have been strengthened in important ways, but major legislation on
money laundering has been delayed by legislative bottlenecks. Limited progress has been made
with restructuring public enterprises and improving statistics.

A. Near-Term Outlook
7.
With a strong rebound in tourism and vibrant private investment, the shortterm economic outlook is favorable. Broadly in line with the authorities’ forecast, staff
projects growth to decelerate only slightly, from 3½ percent in 2004 to 3¼ percent in 2005,
as hotel capacity constraints slow tourism growth. Planned investments in the oil refinery and
the hotels, dominated by foreign investors, will keep growth at about 2½ percent in the
medium term, according to staff estimates. Absent fiscal adjustment, however, staff expects
the non-oil current account deficit to gradually widen, starting in 2006. Risks to the forecasts
are evenly balanced. Besides possible shocks to tourism, the main medium-term downside
risk is from a loose fiscal stance and the real appreciation and associated negative impact on
FDI that this could cause. However, a rebound of tourism fueled by a stronger-than-projected
recovery in the United States could accelerate investment in tourism.
B. Fiscal Policy
8.
The authorities recognized the importance of rebalancing the policy mix, but the
preelectoral period was not seen as conducive to expenditure cutbacks. The budget
targets a combined deficit, including the AZV, of about 2¼ percent of GDP, down from an
estimated 5½ percent in 2004. Staff welcomed the targeted fiscal adjustment, which would be
essential for arresting the rapid growth of public debt, but noted that, in light of the 2004
fiscal outcome, the revenue projections were unrealistic. Projecting a combined deficit of
5¼ percent of GDP, staff recommended corrective measures: keeping the wage bill
unchanged from last year and reducing expenditure on goods and services. The authorities
thought that their recent measures in the health care system would be sufficient to meet the

- 10 -

deficit target of AZV but felt that additional sizable expenditure measures would have to be
postponed toward the end of the year.
9.
There was, nevertheless, consensus that ambitious medium-term fiscal
consolidation would be needed to lower public debt to a safer level. The authorities
explained that their plan to eliminate the budget deficit by 2007 (laid out in their 2002
medium-term fiscal strategy) had been hindered by the recession and the rapid increase in
health care costs (Text Figure). Noting that public debt (at over 45 percent of GDP) was
already too high, given Aruba’s vulnerability to external shocks, and that debt would
significantly increase further if fiscal policy were left unchanged (Table 7), staff urged the
authorities to renew efforts to consolidate public finances. To this end, in addition to the
measures in 2005, staff recommended a medium-term adjustment path that would eliminate
the budget deficit and reduce public debt to 40 percent of GDP by 2009 (Text Table). Given
the already considerable overall tax burden, including social security contributions, and the
need to maintain competitiveness and high labor utilization, adjustment should be mostly on
the expenditure side—focusing on payroll and health care expenditures (both of which have
increased rapidly since 2001).3

The monetary authorities stressed the need for fiscal adjustment in light of the
deteriorating net foreign asset position. Staff agreed, adding that its foreign debt
sustainability analysis, assuming the absence of fiscal adjustment, projects net foreign assets,
which were over 10 percent of GDP in 2001, to turn into a net liability position of about
14 percent of GDP by 2009 (Tables 8 and 9). This decline, together with the refinancing risk
stemming from a large gross foreign debt (57 percent of GDP by 2009), would pose a risk to
macroeconomic stability.
11.
To facilitate fiscal adjustment, staff advocated multiyear budgeting and
supported the initiative to adopt a fiscal responsibility law. To strengthen the fiscal
framework in a medium-term context, the mission suggested setting rolling three-to-five-year
nominal ceilings on major expenditure categories—with a view to identifying the structural
measures needed to achieve them—and integrating them into the annual budget process. This
would provide flexibility: revenue shocks could be accommodated and provisions could be
made for adjusting the ceilings if the key parameters underlying the framework (e.g., the

- 12 -

assumption on long-term growth) changed. To support such a framework, the authorities saw
merit in conducting a focused expenditure policy review to set new budget priorities and
identify expenditure reform options, and the possibility of a fiscal responsibility law had been
put forward. Staff agreed that a fiscal responsibility law that strengthened fiscal transparency,
improved the budget process (e.g., by requiring multiyear budgeting), and set a fiscal rule
would provide credibility and a forward-looking perspective to fiscal policy. In particular, it
would not only induce the government to take timely action when the fiscal rule was not
observed, but it would also strengthen the case for such action vis-à-vis society and
parliament. The authorities expressed interest in obtaining Fund advice on design and
implementation issues.
12.

The discussions turned to the details of the required expenditure reforms:

•

The authorities have taken a series of measures to rein in health care costs. They
explained that the management of the newly-created AZV was caught off guard by
the rapid increase in health care costs after the introduction of universal health care
in 2001 (Text Table). As a result, health care expenditure relative to GDP reached
9.1 percent in 2003, one of the highest in the world (Figure 5). The government has
replaced AZV management and has taken measures to introduce stricter controls on
hospital admissions, referrals to specialists and lab tests by family doctors. Staff
welcomed these measures, while also urging the authorities to submit the legislation
on copayments, which was an essential measure to limit demand for health care
services. The authorities also planned to increase contribution rates with a view to
balancing the position of AZV. Staff considered that it was necessary and achievable
to balance the position of the AZV by 2007 by reducing demand and costs and
improving revenue collection, and recommended preserving an increase in
contribution rates only as a measure of last resort.

Despite a wage freeze and plans to reduce the size of the civil service, payroll
costs have increased rapidly since 2001. The authorities attributed this to the 13
days of additional annual leave granted in the agreement with the unions on the wage
freeze, which created a need for additional hiring (Text Figure). They also regretted
the delay in implementing their plan to reduce the civil service by offering severance
packages to selected groups of employees. While appreciating the difficulties that
such schemes typically entailed, staff urged the authorities to move ahead on this
front and use all available options, including natural attrition, to start reducing public
sector employment. Noting that public sector wages, in particular for low-skilled
workers, were significantly above market wages, staff considered strong wage
discipline in the public sector essential to maintaining wage moderation in the
economy.

The authorities saw the recent pension reform for new members as an important
first step to restore the solvency of the public sector pension scheme. The
retirement age has been increased from 55 to 60 years, and benefits have been
significantly reduced. Reflecting these changes, the combined contribution rate for
new entrants has also been reduced, from 31.5 to 15.5 percent. This reform, together
with the conversion of past government-contribution arrears into interest-bearing
loans, has considerably improved the financial position of the pension fund for public
sector employees (APFA). Nonetheless, as the authorities explained, APFA’s assets
still covered less than 90 percent of its accrued pension liabilities. As part of the
process of making it fully independent from the government, APFA was given
independent legal status in December 2004. Further reform for the existing members
is needed, however, to fully restore APFA’s capital base. This is also a prerequisite
for planned central bank supervision, which would strengthen APFA’s oversight.

- 14 -

•

The reform of the universal pay-as-you-go pension scheme has also suffered a
political set-back. The authorities pointed to the still generous public sector pension
scheme and the lack of adequate private pension savings as factors that made it
politically difficult for them to increase the retirement age from 60 to 62 years. In this
context, they noted that participation in private pension funds other than APFA was
below 15 percent of the working-age population. Acknowledging the authorities’
concern on this point, staff recommended reviewing the tax code, with a view to
eliminating disincentives to pension saving.

13.
The authorities have taken several measures to improve the tax regime but have
further postponed the introduction of a broad-based consumption tax previously
recommended by staff. They broadened the corporate income tax (CIT) base and instituted
a single-rate 35 percent profit tax and a 10 percent dividend tax. Moreover, in accordance
with an agreement with the OECD in the context of eliminating harmful tax practices, the
offshore CIT regime is being phased out. While confirming their commitment to refrain from
offering CIT incentives, which was welcomed by staff, the authorities noted that the growing
tax competition in the region encouraged foreign investors to seek other forms of tax
concessions in Aruba. In addition, they explained that the introduction of a consumption tax
had to be further postponed because the tax department was found unprepared to administer
such a tax. Staff viewed a simple tax system as the best way of attracting foreign investors to
Aruba. Noting that a broad-based consumption tax would also be necessary to reduce the
disproportionate reliance on income taxes (which generated about half of the total tax
revenue of the central government), staff urged the authorities to continue implementing the
required tax administration reforms. The mission also reiterated its previous recommendation
to simplify the personal income tax, particularly with a view to narrowing the tax wedge for
highly-skilled people, since the marginal rate could currently reach as high as 60 percent.
14.
The government has made significant progress in eliminating expenditure
arrears and putting in place a control mechanism to avoid accumulating new arrears.
Owing to poor budget management, arrears to APFA and suppliers had accumulated rapidly
in the past, reaching 8.4 percent of GDP by end-2003. Besides converting the arrears to
APFA, about 80 percent of the total, into loans, most uncontested arrears to suppliers were
also settled in 2004. The government has also made further efforts to start collecting overdue
student loan payments. Welcoming these improvements, which will increase fiscal
transparency and reduce costs, staff encouraged the authorities to extend their efforts to other
parts of the general government and remain vigilant to avoid the reoccurrence of arrears.
C. Monetary Policy
15.
Though inflationary pressures were absent, the authorities were considering
tightening monetary policy to restrain domestic demand because of current account
concerns. In agreeing that short-term inflationary pressures were absent, staff noted that the
lagged impact of monetary tightening still in the pipeline was likely to keep inflationary
pressures at bay. Moreover, with FDI financing a considerable part of the non-oil current

- 15 -

account deficit in 2003–04, the mission felt that the underlying current account position had
improved considerably and, therefore, saw no immediate need for a tightening. However,
there was agreement that a continued loose fiscal stance would deteriorate the current
account position and, thus, would likely make monetary tightening unavoidable in the future.
16.
The use of indirect monetary policy instruments remains limited. The CBA
introduced a six-month certificate of deposit, but the absence of a liquid market and the
CBA’s reluctance to compensate for this in the price made this instrument unattractive for
banks. The authorities also felt that, in general, the absence of a well-functioning interest rate
channel rendered indirect monetary policy instruments ineffective in curbing excessive credit
demand. While appreciating the difficulties involved, staff noted that direct control entailed a
significant efficiency cost and, thus, encouraged the authorities to renew their efforts to
introduce new indirect instruments.
17.
Pointing to Aruba’s vulnerability to external shocks and the rapid increase in
foreign public debt, the monetary authorities stressed the need to strengthen
international reserves. They also stressed, and staff concurred, that improving the current
account position, rather than further reliance on public foreign borrowing, was the best way
to increase reserves. There was also agreement that Aruba’s vulnerabilities—specifically,
dependence on highly volatile tourism receipts—suggest a need for a substantial margin of
comfort (Box 3 summarizes the staff’s analysis, carried out in cooperation with the
authorities). Staff, while finding the reserve position broadly adequate in the present
circumstances, agreed on the advisability of reversing the erosion in the level of reserves
since 2002—also to accommodate the future increase in repayment obligations resulting
from higher public debt (Text Figure). At the same time, staff noted that it was not clear that
the merits of increasing reserves above this level would outweigh the financial carrying costs.
18.
Views on Aruba’s competitiveness differed, with staff finding it broadly
adequate. The monetary authorities were concerned about the real appreciation of the
Aruban florin against the U.S. dollar and the impact of the devaluation of several Latin
American currencies. Private investors in the tourism sector, however, were upbeat about
Aruba’s competitiveness and considered the exchange rate appropriate. The historically
highest level of hotel room capacity utilization and foreign investors’ plans to rapidly
increase room capacity in the coming years also support this assessment. Reflecting the
weakening of the U.S. dollar, the real effective exchange rate calculated by staff based on
market shares in tourism, by far the most important export industry, shows no persistent real
appreciation in the past few years, thereby further supporting the private sector’s assessment
(Text Figure). There was agreement that, given the strong ties to the U.S. economy and the
stable real effective exchange rate, the peg to the U.S. dollar remained an adequate exchange
rate arrangement.

- 16 -

Box 3. Adequacy of Aruba’s International Reserves
To better inform the public discussion, the monetary authorities asked the staff to assess
the adequacy of Aruba’s international reserves. The CBA has targeted a reserve level,
including the net foreign assets of commercial banks, equal to six months of imports of goods.
While recognizing the importance of the import coverage ratio, staff also recommended
indicators that took into account the demand for reserves generated by capital account
transactions in judging reserve adequacy. Moreover, it suggested calculating the indicators more
conservatively by excluding the net foreign assets of domestic commercial banks. While noting
that the CBA had the legal power to invoke these assets, staff reiterated the view that it might
prove difficult for the CBA to mobilize these funds in a timely fashion in periods when reserves
were under pressure.
Though Aruba’s reserve position is broadly adequate, several indicators show an erosion of
the international reserve position since 2002 (Box Table). Import coverage and the reserve-tomoney indicators have declined significantly. Aruba meets most internationally-applied standard
thresholds. In particular, reserves cover more than twice the short-term external debt (on a
residual maturity basis, including private debt). Regarding international comparison, Aruba’s
indicators are overall within the range for countries that have successfully maintained similar
exchange rate regimes.

has been significant in Aruba. Staff calculations show that the average annual cost (net of
earnings on reserves) was about 0.6 percent of GDP in 1998–2003.

D. The Long-Term Growth Challenges
19.
The rapid growth of the 1990s relied on a continuous inflow of immigrants to
maintain an ample supply of low-skilled labor, but this strategy kept labor productivity
growth low. While average annual real growth was about 5 percent, labor productivity grew
at a low rate—less than 1 percent a year, about half the rate in European countries with
similar income levels (Figure 4).4 At the same time, the population has increased by about
60 percent since 1986 (Figure 5), making Aruba one of the most densely populated islands in
the Caribbean. Moreover, over one-third of the population is now foreign-born. There is an
emerging consensus in Aruba that the island is nearing its carrying capacity.
20.
With net immigration subsiding, the long-term growth potential will
significantly decline, especially if labor productivity trends remain unchanged. In spite
of low fertility rates, the continuous inflow of young immigrants has so far kept the share of
the working-age population high (Figure 5). A recent official study, based on the
2000 Census, however, found that halting immigration would almost immediately lead to
rapid population aging. Staff noted that, with an unchanged labor productivity trend, this
would lower potential growth to below ½ percent by 2020, putting strong pressure on public
finances (Table 10).5
21.
Fiscal consolidation put aside, meeting the challenges of population aging also
requires policies that create conditions for faster productivity growth. The authorities
have made efforts on several fronts to strengthen Aruba’s long-term growth potential:
•

4

They have promoted diversification, including into higher-value-added service
industries, though with little success recently. While the government’s policy to create
a highly competitive tourism industry has been very successful, many other attempts,
including the creation of a free trade zone, have faltered. With a view to finding new
ways to diversify, the government has requested a World Bank Foreign Investment
Advisory Service review. The plan of the private tourism association to promote, in
cooperation with the government, conference tourism (where value-added is higher) is a
promising avenue for diversification that builds on existing expertise and infrastructure.
Staff welcomed the close cooperation with the private sector in tourism and encouraged
the authorities to apply this model to promote diversification in other areas, in particular
in financial services. It reported, however, that the private sector representatives with

The high share of tourism, which relies extensively on low-skilled labor and has low productivity growth, is
the main factor explaining these productivity trends.
5
The accompanying selected issues paper, which was presented in a public seminar, provides a detailed
analysis of the long-term growth and fiscal implications of population aging. Staff estimates that the ratio of
pension contributors to beneficiaries would decline from about 6 at present to 2½ by 2030, if net immigration
were reduced to nil starting in 2005. This decline, which almost fully accounts for the deterioration in the
primary position, combined with a resulting slowdown in economic growth and a weak initial primary position,
would lead to an escalation of public debt.

- 19 -

whom the mission met considered the poor road infrastructure as a major hindrance to
their initiatives.
•

The authorities recognized the importance of improving labor skills to promote
higher labor productivity. The large share of low-skilled labor has locked Aruba into
low-value-added service industries, where productivity growth is slow. Recognizing this
problem, and to preserve Aruba’s achievements in creating high-quality public education,
the authorities saw a need for improvements, in particular in areas with high
concentrations of immigrants. They also recognized that fiscal reforms were needed to
free up resources for education, where expenditure as a share of GDP had remained
unchanged in the past years, even though the student population had increased rapidly.
Pointing to the strong relationship between educational achievement and poverty, staff
encouraged the authorities to monitor the most disadvantaged groups more closely. Staff
stressed that lifting these groups out of poverty by promoting higher educational
achievement was also central to accelerating economy-wide labor productivity growth.

22.
Maintaining a high level of labor utilization is also essential to sustain growth in
the long run. Aruba’s overall level of labor utilization, one of the highest among developed
economies, was maintained in the 1990s, owing to high labor force participation and long
working hours, in particular among immigrants. Labor utilization among the Aruba-born,
better-educated and higher-income population, however, was significantly lower. This
suggests that, in the absence of reforms and sizable net immigration, existing trends are likely
to lead to a continuous decline in the overall rate of labor utilization. Pointing to low old-age
labor participation rates, staff noted that pension reforms, by increasing the effective
retirement age, could to a large extent counterbalance this decline.
E. Improving the Quality of Public Institutions
23.
There was an agreement that the central bank law needed to be reviewed with a
view to strengthening the legal framework for central bank independence. In assessing
the law, staff noted that the term in office of the CBA president and modalities of dismissal
were not stipulated by law but instead set on an ad hoc basis in a private contract. Moreover,
the existing legislation provides the government-appointed supervisory board with wideranging control over the management of the CBA, including close control over its operational
budget and opportunities to interfere with monetary policymaking. The law also allows for
the direct financing of the budget, though only for temporary needs and upon the approval of
the CBA president. While agreeing that a review of the law would be useful, the monetary
authorities explained that the actual practice provided the CBA with a high degree of
operational independence and that the CBA had for long refrained from providing any
financing for the government. To avoid delays, the government expressed interest in
receiving assistance with preparing the necessary amendments.
24.
Progress in restructuring public companies has been slow. The planned
incorporation of public sector utility companies to improve their governance has been
delayed. The private sector representatives with whom the mission met said that they were

- 20 -

disappointed by the lack of progress in this area and were strongly critical of the expansion of
the activities of public companies into areas where the private sector could thrive, such as
cable TV or garbage collection. Staff urged rapid progress on this front and noted that the
restructuring of public companies was also needed to strengthen wage discipline in this
sector. The mission also emphasized the importance of opening up, where possible, the
markets of these companies to competition.
25.
Though national accounts at current prices and general government fiscal
accounts have been compiled, little progress has been made in improving price and
labor market statistics. As a result, national accounts at constant prices and terms of trade
data are still not available, and basic labor market statistics are not produced on a regular
basis. Moreover, the general government statistics published by the Central Bureau of
Statistics (CBS) need to be reconciled with the data produced by the Finance Directorate.
The CBS management explained that long-awaited household and labor market surveys had
had to be postponed because of the lack of funding. Moreover, they thought that the CBS
needed technical assistance in several areas to tackle these problems. Noting that the lack of
proper and timely data hindered macroeconomic policymaking, staff urged the government to
provide the CBS with adequate funding and offered to help in securing and coordinating
external technical assistance.
F. Financial Sector
26.
The authorities are confident that the banking system is sound and well
supervised (Table 11). They explained that the successful takeover and subsequent
restructuring of a small bank by one of the large commercial banks on commercial terms—
a model for future interventions—had significantly improved the overall soundness of the
system. Staff welcomed the decisive approach the authorities had taken to deal with problem
banks and encouraged them to remain vigilant, especially because of the absence of deposit
insurance in Aruba. Staff, however, agreed with the representatives of the Aruba’s Bankers
Association that this absence encouraged prudent risk management. Noting the persistently
high after-tax return on equity in banking, staff encouraged the authorities to seek ways to
increase competition.
27.
Central bank supervision has been strengthened to combat money laundering,
but the legislation on the supervision of insurance intermediaries and company service
providers has been delayed. The CBA has issued new directives on credit and foreign
exchange risks and carried out on-site examinations to assess key risk areas. Moreover, the
cooperation with banking supervision authorities in the Netherlands Antilles and the United
States has been strengthened. To comply with the recommendations of the Financial Action
Task Force, the authorities adopted a law on the supervision of money transfer companies.
However, the government’s Department of Legal and Legislative Affairs has lacked the
capacity to process the draft legislation on the supervision of company service providers for
submission to parliament. Staff stressed the importance of these laws to improve the
supervision of the financial system and strengthen Aruba’s capacity to fight money

- 21 -

laundering and urged the authorities to make every effort to overcome the legislative
bottleneck.
G. International Trade
28.
Aruba’s has refrained from erecting nontariff trade barriers, but the tariff
structure has remained overly complex, distorting economic activity and imposing an
unnecessary burden on revenue administration. There are no import quotas, and import
licensing is limited to fresh eggs, arms, and medication. The tariff structure, however, has
been left largely unchanged since 1986, with rates ranging from nil on raw materials and
semifinished goods to 40.5 percent on vehicles. Staff encouraged the authorities to simplify
the tariff structure in a revenue-neutral manner.
29.
The authorities plan to abolish the tax on payments to nonresidents, which is a
foreign exchange restriction subject to Fund approval under Article VIII, Section 2(a)
of the Articles of Agreement of the IMF.6 This tax, amounting to 1.3 percent of the
transaction value and levied on any payment by a resident to a nonresident, yields about
0.4 percent of GDP revenue to the government. The authorities plan to replace it with a
license fee for banks providing foreign exchange services.
III. STAFF APPRAISAL
30.
Aruba should build on its success to meet the challenges of the twenty-first
century. Sound institutions and prudent policies helped Aruba achieve a high level of
economic and social development after gaining autonomy. At this stage, however, further
wide-ranging policy and institutional reforms are needed to secure Aruba’s long-term
prosperity. The key tasks are to consolidate public finances in the medium term, to pursue a
new strategy to enhance the long-term growth potential of the country and address the
problems of rapid population aging, and to improve further the quality of public institutions.
31.
The favorable cyclical position provides a good opportunity to rein in the
widening fiscal deficit. With a strong economy, a fiscal stimulus is unnecessary. Moreover,
it is also detrimental from the standpoint of narrowing the non-oil current account deficit and
keeping inflationary pressures in check. Notwithstanding election pressures, efforts should be
made to meet the original budget deficit target in 2005, including measures to curtail
expenditure on purchased goods and services, wages, and health care. This would rebalance
the policy mix and thus reduce the need for the central bank to keep monetary conditions
tight. To improve the budget process, the factors that lead to persistent revenue
overestimation should be identified and eliminated.

6

This tax was introduced when Aruba was part of the Netherlands Antilles to generate revenue for the
government, and Aruba adopted it after gaining autonomy (status aparte) in 1986. Since then, it has served as a
source of general tax revenue for the central government.

- 22 -

32.
Monetary policy should for now remain on hold, barring the reappearance of
inflationary pressures. Given a favorable inflation outlook and a considerable narrowing of
the underlying current account deficit of the non-oil sector, there is no immediate need for
further monetary tightening. Nonetheless, the CBA should closely follow inflation and
current account trends and stand ready to tighten the monetary policy stance if necessary, in
particular if fiscal policy remains loose. Although the reintroduction of credit ceilings seems
to have been effective, the CBA should strive to rely increasingly on market-based monetary
policy instruments in the future.
33.
Aruba has preserved its competitiveness, and the peg to the U.S. dollar remains
appropriate, but international reserves need to be strengthened to raise resilience to
external shocks. Given Aruba’s vulnerability to external shocks and the rapid increase in
public external debt in the past few years, reserves—while still broadly adequate— should be
raised to reverse the erosion since 2002. Costs, however, should be carefully weighed against
benefits before increasing reserves above this level.
34.
In light of the rapid growth of public debt, continued fiscal adjustment is
essential in the medium run. Public indebtedness should be reduced to a safer level to
lessen Aruba’s vulnerability to external and internal shocks. Measures to halt the rapid
growth of the government payroll should be a central element of this adjustment. Further
reforms to reduce health care costs, including measures to limit the demand for health care
services, to restore APFA’s capital base, and to reform the universal pay-as-you-go pension
system before the onset of aging should be the other main areas of reform.
35.
Introducing a medium-term fiscal framework and a fiscal responsibility law
would be key steps to promote fiscal consolidation and enhance the transparency and
credibility of macroeconomic policies. As a first step, an expenditure policy review would
help set new budget priorities and identify expenditure reform options. Setting rolling threeto-five-year nominal ceilings on main expenditure categories—backed by well-identified
fiscal reforms—would provide a suitable framework for medium-term fiscal consolidation. A
fiscal responsibility act, stipulating a transparent fiscal rule, would enhance the credibility of
fiscal policy.
36.
Further tax reforms are needed to broaden the tax base, narrow the tax wedge
on labor, and simplify taxes. The introduction of a broad-based consumption tax is key to
achieving these goals. A simplification of the personal income tax regime would greatly ease
the burden on the tax administration. A lower marginal rate for high-income taxpayers would
also make Aruba a more desirable location for skilled labor and, thereby, facilitate the
development of high-value-added service industries. The outdated import tariff structure also
needs to be simplified to eliminate trade distortions.
37.
Aruba needs to take early action to sustain growth in the face of rapid
population aging. In addition to fiscal consolidation and pension reforms, the economy’s
growth potential needs to be raised. This will require reforms to maintain high labor
utilization and create the conditions for faster productivity growth, including by improving

- 23 -

education and public infrastructure. The cost of postponing reforms is prohibitive, as in their
absence, growth would decline to a very low level and public debt would escalate in the long
run.
38.
While the banking system is generally sound and well supervised, a legal
framework to extend central bank supervision to insurance intermediaries and
company service providers needs to be created. The bottleneck in drafting and vetting
legislation that is hindering the introduction of much-needed supervisory and anti-moneylaundering legislation should be eliminated.
39.
Central bank legislation needs to be modernized, with a view to strengthening
central bank independence. In particular, the term of the CBA president, the reasons for,
and the modalities of, dismissal, the exclusion of government officials from policymaking
bodies, and the explicit prohibition of direct financing of the government by the central bank
should be stipulated by law. In fact, in many areas, these changes would legislate longexisting practices in Aruba.
40.
As it was not introduced for balance-of-payments reasons, staff does not
recommend approval of the foreign exchange restriction arising from the foreign
exchange tax on payments to nonresidents. Moreover, to promote free trade, staff urges the
authorities to phase out this tax as soon as possible. In drafting the regulation on the new
license fee for banks offering foreign exchange services, cooperation with the Fund would be
important to ensure that the regulation is in full compliance with the Articles of Agreement.
41.
The government should reinvigorate its efforts to improve statistics. While data
are broadly adequate for surveillance, macroeconomic policymaking could be usefully
supported by important improvements in several areas. In particular, national accounts,
government finance, and labor market statistics urgently need strengthening, and sufficient
funds should be allocated to the CBS to conduct regular labor market and family budget
surveys. These surveys would also allow the CBS to compile a core set of social indicators to
support social policy formulation.
42.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Aruba remain on the
24-month cycle.

1/ General government (excluding social security and health care) gross debt.
2/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + αε(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; α = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and ε = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as αε(1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium- and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
8/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
9/ In 2005 and 2006, the GDP growth drops by one standard deviation and the revenue to GDP ratio drops by one percentage point. Real interest rate is permanently higher by 200 basis points.
10/ Real depreciation is defined as nominal depreciation (measured by percentage fall in dollar value of local currency) minus domestic inflation (based on GDP deflator).
11/ Or average over a shorter period of time, depending on data availability.
12/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and primary balance) remain at the level in percent of GDP/growth rate of the last projection year.

1/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; ρ = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms,
g = real GDP growth rate, e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock. ρ increases with an appreciating domestic currency (ε > 0)
and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
4/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
5/ The implied change in other key variables under this scenario is discussed in the text.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and nondebt inflows in percent of GDP) remain
at their levels of the last projection year.

B1. Nominal interest rate is at historical average plus two standard deviations in 2005 and 2006

Exchange Arrangements:

The Aruban florin has been pegged to the U.S. dollar at Af. 1.79 per US$1 since
January 1, 1986. In compliance with relevant UN resolutions, Aruba maintains exchange
restrictions on financial transactions with respect to individuals and entities associated
with the former government of Iraq and the previous government of the former Republic
of Yugoslavia.
There is a foreign exchange restriction arising from the foreign exchange tax on
payments by residents to nonresidents. This tax, which amounts to 1.3 percent of the
transaction value, was introduced when Aruba was part of the Netherlands Antilles to
generate revenue for the government. Aruba adopted it after gaining autonomy (status
aparte) in 1986. Since then, it has served as a source of general tax revenue for the
central government of Aruba.

APPENDIX II

KINGDOM OF THE NETHERLANDS—ARUBA: STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.

Real sector

Aruba produces CPI data, and the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) recently published
national accounts for 1995 through 2002, as well as preliminary estimates for 2003. More
detailed sector accounts have been made available for the years 1995–2000. There are plans
for the compilation of input-output tables and for a detailed tourism satellite account. The
CBS is interested in developing deflators and trade price data, also in order to be able to
compile national accounts at constant prices. A joint Caribbean labor market survey should
improve the availability of labor market data this year.
2.

Fiscal sector

Aruba does not report government finance statistics to STA, either for publication in the GSF
Yearbook or in the IFS.
3.

Monetary sector

The Central Bank of Aruba (CBA) reports monetary data to STA on a timely basis, and it is
anticipated that Aruba’s planned shift to the standard reporting format for monetary statistics
will provide a new opportunity to review their methods in compiling the statistics.
4.

External sector

The CBA reports quarterly balance-of-payments data. However, it would be useful to publish
a more detailed breakdown of exports and imports, for example by economic use (consumer
goods, fuels, raw materials, and capital goods) or by commodities. Also, it would be
desirable to narrow––to the extent possible––the differences between trade data from the
CBA and those in the national accounts.
Aruba publishes monthly data on the official reserve position, with a lag of one month,
providing a breakdown in holdings of gold and foreign currency. As prescribed by the SDDS,
data on foreign liabilities of the monetary sector—including a breakdown by maturity (long
and short term) and instrument—and the central government are published on a quarterly
basis, with a lag of about one quarter. Data provision on foreign debt of the nonfinancial
private sector, however, is on an annual basis only. A debt survey covering both the public
and private sector debt provides information on the amount, average maturity, and currency
denomination of foreign debt outstanding. There is no disaggregation by instrument or
information on amortization payments coming due.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
June 1, 2005

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Concludes 2005 Article IV Consultation with the Kingdom of the
Netherlands—Aruba
On May 25, 2005, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with the Kingdom of the Netherlands—Aruba.1
Background
After a two-year long recession, GDP growth reached 1.4 percent in 2003, helped by strong
private investment, and accelerated to an estimated 3½ percent in 2004. Growth is projected to
level off at about 3¼ percent in 2005, as hotel capacity constraints slow tourism growth. Planned
investments in the oil refinery and the hotels are expected to keep growth at about 2½ percent in
the medium term.
Strong domestic demand, fueled by double-digit private credit growth and fiscal expansion, and a
sharp increase in the oil price in 2002, had reignited inflation, which peaked at about 4.3 percent
in mid-2003. To stem inflationary pressures, credit ceilings were reintroduced in 2003 and
subsequently tightened in 2004. Average inflation fell to 2½ percent in 2004. The real effective
exchange rate of the Aruban florin, which has been pegged to the U.S. dollar since 1986, has
remained largely unchanged since 1998. Declining net tourism revenue and robust import
demand widened the (rolling 12-month) non-oil current account deficit to almost 12 percent
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return
to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive
Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board,
summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's
authorities.

-2of GDP by mid-2003, but the deficit has narrowed subsequently with the strengthening of tourism
revenue. The debt-creating external deficit (non-oil current account deficit plus FDI), however,
has remained significantly lower and improved faster than the headline deficit. Reflecting these
trends and government payment obligations, international reserves have declined since 2002, to
about 5¼ months of imports in September 2004.
The fiscal deficit, which widened sharply during the recession, continued to deteriorate, from
3½ percent of GDP (including health care) in 2003 to an estimated 5½ percent in 2004.
The health care fund has experienced large spending overruns since the introduction of universal
health care in 2001. Moreover, despite a nominal freeze, total wage costs increased by a
cumulative 12 percent in 2001–03, reflecting a rapid increase in public sector employment. Large
deficits and called guarantees increased public debt sharply, from 28½ percent of GDP in 2000 to
some 46 percent in 2004.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for Aruba’s strong record of sustained high
growth and macroeconomic stability since gaining autonomy in 1986. These achievements have
been underpinned by strong public institutions and prudent macroeconomic policies. Looking
ahead, Directors encouraged the authorities to build on their successes and pursue further wideranging policy and institutional reforms to secure Aruba’s long-term prosperity. The key tasks are
to consolidate public finances, to pursue a strategy to enhance the economy’s long-term growth
potential and diversification and address the problem of rapid population aging, and to improve
further the quality of public institutions. Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to pursue
the policies and reforms required to achieve these objectives.
Directors urged the authorities to take advantage of the favorable cyclical position in order to rein
in the widening fiscal deficit, and make strong efforts to meet the original 2005 budget deficit
target. They viewed fiscal consolidation as essential to narrow further the non-oil current account
deficit and reduce the burden on monetary policy.
Looking forward, Directors stressed the need for ambitious fiscal adjustment over the medium
term to lower public debt to a safer level. In this context, they encouraged the authorities to
introduce a fiscal responsibility law and a medium-term fiscal framework, which should facilitate
the required fiscal consolidation and enhance policy credibility. They considered that a key
medium-term objective should be to eliminate the budget deficit and reduce the public debt by the
end of the decade. This will require wide-ranging expenditure reforms, including with respect to
health care, civil service, and pension reforms. In this context, they welcomed the recent
measures to reduce health care costs and the reform of the public sector pension scheme for
new participants. Directors welcomed the progress made in eliminating expenditure arrears, and
encouraged the authorities to continue strengthening budget management to prevent their
recurrence. Directors highlighted the need for further tax reforms to broaden the tax base, narrow
the tax wedge on labor, and simplify taxes. In particular, the introduction of a broad-based
consumption tax and a simplification of the income tax were regarded as important. In the area of
tax policy, Directors commended the authorities’ decision to phase out tax holidays and
guarantees.
Directors encouraged the authorities to take early action to sustain growth in the face of rapid
population aging. In addition to fiscal consolidation and pension reforms, they recommended

-3measures to maintain high labor utilization and create the conditions for faster productivity
growth, including by improving education and public infrastructure. Directors also called for faster
progress in restructuring public enterprises to open up markets for private sector activity.
Underscoring the importance of economic diversification to enhance the country’s growth
potential, they welcomed Aruba’s request for a World Bank Foreign Investment Advisory Service
report on Aruba’s development strategy.
Directors commended the authorities for successfully taming the inflationary pressures that had
emerged at the beginning of the recent recovery. Noting that the inflation outlook is favorable and
the underlying current account deficit of the non-oil sector has been narrowing, Directors saw no
immediate need for further monetary tightening. Given the uncertainties, however, they called on
the central bank to continue to monitor price and non-oil current account developments closely,
and to stand ready to tighten the monetary policy stance if necessary. Directors noted that credit
controls have been effective in dampening inflationary pressures. They encouraged the
authorities to strengthen efforts to develop indirect monetary policy instruments over the medium
term.
Directors noted that the peg to the U.S. dollar remains appropriate, and that Aruba has broadly
maintained its competitiveness. Given the economy’s dependence on highly volatile tourism
revenue and the rapid increase in public sector external debt, Directors saw a case for rebuilding
reserves to end-2002 levels.
Directors noted that the financial sector is generally sound and well supervised. Overcoming the
capacity constraints that have slowed drafting and vetting of supervisory and anti-money
laundering legislation should be given priority. Directors also considered it particularly urgent to
proceed with extending central bank supervision to company service providers and insurance
intermediaries.
Directors noted that long existing practices in Aruba provide the central bank with a high degree
of operational independence. Nonetheless, they considered strengthening the legal guarantees
for central bank independence as an important way to enhance policy credibility further. In this
context, they welcomed the authorities’ intention to move toward modernization of the central
bank law and encouraged the authorities to seek IMF technical assistance with drafting the new
law. Directors called on the authorities to eliminate the remaining exchange restriction subject to
Fund approval under Article VIII as soon as possible.
Directors urged the authorities to renew their efforts to strengthen statistics. They judged that
improvements are particularly needed in national accounts, government finance, and labor
market statistics, as well as social indicators.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.
