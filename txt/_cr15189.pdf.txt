IMF Executive Board Concludes 2014 Article IV Consultation with Antigua and Barbuda
On November 24, 2014, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Antigua and Barbuda.
A modest recovery is underway but macroeconomic indicators are still weak and important
vulnerabilities remain. Economic activity in the first half of 2014 showed continuing signs of
recovery following real GDP growth of 1.8 percent in 2013. Tourism has performed strongly,
with stay-over arrivals up 7.7 percent during the first half of the year. The winter tourist season
was the most successful since 2009. Nevertheless, tourist arrivals are still over 5 percent below
pre-global crisis (2008) levels while real GDP is 14 percent lower. Commercial bank credit to the
private sector was down by 4.4 percent in June 2014 compared with a year ago, as banks
continue to deal with high levels of non-performing loans. Inflation remains subdued, reflecting
sluggish aggregate demand and the absence of international commodity price pressures. The
fiscal stance was eased after the Stand-by Arrangement ended in June 2013 and in the run up to
the June 2014 elections. At the same time, scheduled external amortization has more than
doubled this year to nearly 3 percent of GDP. With limited financing options, there was a reemergence of arrears on external debt.
On current trends, growth would remain modest, with risks tilted slightly to the downside. Real
GDP would grow by 1.9 percent in 2014 and 1.7 percent in 2015, underpinned by the ongoing
recovery in North America and the United Kingdom. Although the government has begun to
address its fiscal imbalances, arrears would be projected to grow. Increased cash flow problems
for the government and unattended banking system problems represent serious downside risks.
On the other hand, the possibility of large inflows from the Citizenship by Investment Program
(CIP) and foreign direct investments could significantly improve the outlook. However, these
would not obviate the need for important policy adjustments.
Executive Board Assessment1
Executive Directors noted that macroeconomic and financial conditions in Antigua and Barbuda
remain challenging. While a modest recovery continues, long standing problems in the fiscal and

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers

banking sectors remain unresolved, including unsustainable public debt, persistent large
financing gaps, and high non performing loans and the delay in bank resolution. Directors
underscored the need for decisive action to restore fiscal and debt sustainability as a matter of
priority. They also emphasized the importance of achieving macroeconomic and financial
stability to underpin stronger growth.
Directors noted the urgency of addressing the cash flow problem. They encouraged the
authorities to adopt a comprehensive medium term fiscal consolidation program beginning with
the upcoming 2015 budget. While welcoming the measures recently taken, they considered that,
given limited financing options, additional measures would be required on the revenue side to
improve tax collection and administration, and reduce tax incentives while enhancing regional
collaboration to avoid tax competition. They also recommended measures to reduce the wage
bill, and cut transfers to state owned enterprises and improve their financial performance and
oversight more broadly.
Directors stressed that fiscal efforts should continue over the medium term to reform public
financial management and strengthen the cash management system. They saw the benefits of a
strong fiscal framework, including a fiscal rule prioritizing the reduction of debt to sustainable
levels. In this context, Directors recommended using revenues from the CIP to first pay off
arrears and reduce debt, while adhering to the highest level of transparency and governance in
the administration of the CIP.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to expedite the resolution of Antigua and Barbuda
Investment Bank. It would be important to ensure that resources are available to fund the
resolution while safeguarding fiscal sustainability. Directors looked forward to progress on the
asset quality review and legislative reforms in support of the ECCU regional bank resolution
strategy.
Directors agreed that boosting growth and employment continues to be a high priority. They
advised that the focus be placed on improving cost competitiveness and the investment climate.
In this regard, they saw a need for reforms of the energy sector, including the state owned utility
company, aimed at reducing energy costs and improving efficiency. Lower labor costs and
deeper regional collaboration, particularly on labor market issues, would also help enhance
productivity.
Directors welcomed the new government’s swift action to settle arrears and commitment to
remain current with its obligations to the Fund. Noting the high risk of debt distress, they
encouraged the authorities to explore available financing and debt management options.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
AND SECOND POST-PROGRAM MONITORING

KEY ISSUES
Context. The new government that came to power in June 2014 inherited serious fiscal and
external payments problems, including arrears to the Fund and other creditors, and
unresolved banking sector problems. Moreover, public debt remains at an unsustainable
level of close to 100 percent of GDP, while economic activity has been weak with output still
well below the level reached at the time of the 2008/09 global financial crisis.
Main policy recommendations
 Implement fiscal measures equivalent to 2.8 percent of GDP in 2015 to tackle cash flow
problems and achieve an underlying primary surplus of 3.0 percent of GDP by 2016 to
address debt sustainability challenges. Underpin measures with structural fiscal reforms.
 Use Citizenship by Investment Program revenues to pay down arrears and debt and fund
bank resolution. The program should be managed in line with the high standards of
governance and transparency set out in the law.
 Move expeditiously as planned with the resolution of ABI Bank and support initiatives
underway to strengthen the regional bank resolution framework, in particular, the
passage of needed legislative reforms.
 Improve competitiveness by moderating labor costs; increasing energy efficiency,
including by better performance of the state-owned utility company; and improving the
investment climate.
Authorities’ views. The authorities broadly agreed with staff’s assessment of the economic
situation and risks, and its recommendations to reduce fiscal vulnerabilities and strengthen
the banking system. They were more optimistic about growth prospects for 2015 based on
expectations for substantial FDI. They are opposed to increases in taxes and plan to focus
fiscal efforts on cutting recurrent spending. On bank resolution, they wish to work closely
with the Fund and World Bank to speedily address outstanding problems. They paid the
arrears to the Fund and committed to timely servicing of Fund obligations.
Data provision. Data provision is adequate for surveillance and post-program monitoring
although significant areas for improvement remain, in particular on labor market statistics,
measurement of arrears, financial information on state-owned enterprises, and national
accounts by expenditure components.

BACKGROUND
1.
Political and economic environment. On June 12, 2014, the Antigua and Barbuda Labor
Party won a clear victory over the United Progressive Party, which had been in power for ten years.
The new government, sworn in on June 13, inherited a difficult economic situation, including weak
activity, severe cash flow problems, unsustainable debt, and banking problems.
2.
Relations with the Fund. The last Article IV Consultation was completed on October 31,
2012. The Executive Board discussed the First Post-Program Monitoring on April 21, 2014. At that
time, Directors noted the significant deterioration of economic performance in the aftermath of the
36-month, SDR67.5 million Stand-by Arrangement (SBA), which ended in June 2013. They stressed
that if this situation persisted, growth would continue to be subdued, fiscal pressures would grow,
and debt would remain unsustainable. Antigua and Barbuda has accepted the obligations of Article
VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on making payments
and transfers for current international transactions.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
Since the end of the SBA in June 2013, growth has been modest but macroeconomic
management has weakened and serious cash flow problems have emerged.
3.

A modest recovery is underway but fiscal and financial sector risks have risen.



Economic activity. Activity in the first half of 2014 showed continuing signs of recovery
following real GDP growth of 1.8 percent in 2013 (Figure 1). Tourism has performed strongly,
with stay-over arrivals up 7.7 percent during the first half of the year. The winter tourist season
was the most successful since 2009. Nevertheless, tourist arrivals are still over 5 percent below
pre-global crisis (2008) levels while real GDP is 14 percent lower. Inflation in August stood at
1.7 percent (y-o-y), up from 1.1 percent at end-2013, with higher clothing and energy prices.



Public finances. The fiscal
stance was eased substantially
in the run-up to the elections
(Figure 3). Spending for the
first six months of 2014 was
up 7.1 percent compared with
the same period in 2013,
while tax revenue grew by 3.1
percent. For the 12-month
period July 2013-June 2014,
the primary balance
deteriorated to -1.5 percent

of GDP from +0.6 percent for the July 2012-June 2013 period. Scheduled external amortization
has more than doubled this year to nearly 3 percent of GDP from 1¼ percent in 2013, mainly as
a result of repayment obligations to the Fund and Paris Club creditors (Box 2). With limited
options for external borrowing following the end of the SBA on account of Antigua and
Barbuda’s already elevated debt levels, external financing was mainly through the accumulation
of arrears, which grew by 1.5 percent of GDP in the first half of 2014. Arrears to the Fund
emerged in early June as two scheduled payments were missed. The new government settled
Fund arrears in July and has made subsequent payments on time.


Monetary and financial developments. Both indigenous and foreign banks continue to suffer
from weak financial soundness indicators (Figure 4).1 Non-performing loans stabilized at
14.5 percent of total loans in March 2014 (including ABI Bank). Credit to the private sector, which
was down 4.4 percent (y-o-y) in June 2014, has been in decline since 2011. ABI Bank, which has
an estimated capital gap of 8 percent of GDP was intervened by the ECCB in 2011 but is still
unresolved. An asset quality review (AQR) of all indigenous banks will start in 2014Q4.

1

8 commercial banks operate in Antigua and Barbuda with total assets of 168 percent of GDP at end-March 2014. There are
four indigenous banks and four branches/subsidiaries of foreign banks. These two groups have broadly equal shares of
deposits, while the indigenous banks have only 35 percent of total assets, reflecting the large negative equity of ABI Bank.

Recommendations

Implementation status

Fiscal policy
Expenditure rationalization and structural reforms: Seek fiscal saving
through more targeted subsidies and transfers; rationalizing public benefit
packages; and improving government services through outsourcing,
amalgamating departments, and forming a single civil service.

Draft revised public service legislation was prepared and functional reviews of
ministries were initiated, with TA support in 2013. However, the need for fiscal
saving through effective PFM as initially advised still remains a key fiscal
challenge.

Tax reform: Broaden tax base by eliminating exemptions, and carrying out a
tax exemption study to identify possible reforms.

Legislation to tax benefits as required under PAYE law was approved. Increased
tax compliance of state-owned enterprises was achieved. The compliance rate
of professionals with tax obligations was significantly increased. However, the
passage of the Tax Administration and Procedures Act is still pending.

Parametric reform in the pension sustem: Raise contribution rate, increase
the retirement age, and change the formula for calculating pensionable
earnings. Similar measures were recommended for the non-contributory civil
service pension scheme.

Comprehensive reform of the social security scheme was approved by the
Social Security Board.

SOE oversight and reform: Set up an oversight, institutional and reporting
framework for SOEs, commence reviews of selected SOEs to assess fiscal risks.

An oversight unit for SOEs was established in the Ministry of Finance. But few
SOEs (on average 6 out 26) are fully (and consistently) complying with the
data submission requirement and fiscal risk assessments are still pending.

Financial policy
Offshore banks and non-bank financial institutions: Need for a more
coordinated approach to supervision that takes into account possible links
between off-shore institutions and the domestic financial system.

No progress made.

Banking supervision and regulatory reform: Introduce consolidated
supervision and prepare a plan to improve regulations for asset classifications,
loan loss provisioning, and risk-based supervision. More specifically: (i) passing
stand-alone legislation to govern the Financial Services Regulatory
Commission (FSRC) which supervises non-banks; and (ii) ECCB to conduct onsite examinations of indigenous banks in Antigua and Barbuda.

Stand-alone legislation to govern the FSRC was approved by the parliament
and on-site examinations of indigenous banks have been undertaken.
However, further strengthening of supervision is needed.

Swiftly address problem bank resolution.

Valuation report for ABIB concluded in December 2012 and an asset
management company to dispose of the impaired assets of ABIB was
established in 2013. However, the resolution of ABI Bank is still pending.

Business environment and growth
Raising productivity in the public sector: Unify established and nonestablished employee frameworks.

No progress made.

Reform of labor market: Reform policy for hiring temporary or seasonal
workers. Produce labor market statistics (non-existent in Antigua and Barbuda).

No progress made.

Box 2. Government Financing
The IMF was a key source of financing during 2010-13. On average, IMF funding accounted for about
68 percent of the government’s net financing
between 2011 and 2013. However, with the end of
the SBA program in June 2013 the IMF is no

securities (including some private placements), and repaid about EC$106 million, for net financing of
EC$108 million from the RGSM. However, the government is experiencing some difficulties in securing
financing from the RGSM; one of its auctions was undersubscribed and another one was cancelled given the
uncertainty surrounding the timing and result of the elections. In these circumstances, the authorities have
resorted to private placements to surplus quasi-public sector entities such as PDVCAB, the entity that
administers the Petrocaribe arrangement, and MBS, the medical benefits fund. In July 2014, the government
made two private bond placements totaling about EC$39 million with MBS, PDVCAB, and the National
Development Fund, which administers the contributions to the Citizenship by Investment Program (CIP), in
part to settle outstanding arrears to the Fund.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
On current trends, growth would remain modest. However, worsening cash flow problems
and unattended banking system problems would increase risks of a crisis. The prospect of
large CIP revenues and private investments could significantly improve the outlook but
would not obviate the need for significant policy adjustments.
4.
Growth would continue to be modest in 2014–15 (Text table 2). Growth is projected at
1.9 percent in 2014 and 1.7 percent in 2015. A moderate recovery is expected in the tourism sector,
based on the ongoing cyclical recovery in North America and the United Kingdom and the
expansion of the airport scheduled to be completed in early 2015, which will allow more flights. At
the same time, rising government arrears, ongoing banking system problems, and deteriorating

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA

conditions at key SOEs would undermine confidence and be a drag on growth in the non-tradable
sectors of the economy. With aggregate demand still subdued and no international price pressures,
inflation would remain low.
5.
Although some fiscal consolidation is envisaged, arrears would be projected to grow
(Text table 3). For 2014 as a whole, the central government primary balance would shift from a
deficit of 1.6 percent of GDP in 2013 to surpluses of 1.6 percent in 2014 and 3.2 percent in 2015. The
improvement is based on cuts in recurrent expenditure (see paragraph 7). In addition, revenues
could increase substantially owing to the new Citizenship by Investment Program (CIP). The
underlying primary deficit (i.e., excluding CIP revenues and one-off factors) would narrow to
0.3 percent of GDP in 2014 and 0.2 percent in 2015. However, the improvement in the overall
primary balance would not be sufficient to cover elevated debt service obligations, thereby leading
to further accumulation of arrears and a financing gap of 0.6 percent of GDP in 2014 and 1.8 percent
in 2015. There would be insufficient resources to finance the resolution of ABI Bank.

There is significant uncertainty associated with this projection with risks tilted slightly
to the downside.2


Upside risks. The authorities are counting on substantial private investments in the hotel sector.
If these were to materialize, growth could turn out to be substantially stronger than projected in
2015 and beyond (Text table 4 and paragraph 26). 3 For example, a new Sandals resort could
raise the growth rate by an average of 2 percentage points in 2015–17 (Appendix II). The largest
investment project is the proposed Yida resort development which, according to the authorities,
would amount to an investment of 160 percent of GDP over ten years. The country’s financing
windows could be larger than envisaged under the current trend. In particular, the authorities
are aggressively seeking new sources of bilateral financing, including from China and Mexico,
and exploring options to improve debt management. CIP revenues could also turn out to be
larger than projected—the comparable program in St. Kitts and Nevis earns more than
10 percent of GDP for the treasury. In an emergency, to ease a liquidity crunch, PDVCAB, the
state-owned company that administers the Petrocaribe arrangement, could liquidate some of its
foreign investments and increase its exposure to the government (Appendix III).

Downside risks. There is a risk that the projected domestic financing may not be forthcoming.
Some investors, in particular, the foreign-owned banks, are reducing their exposure to
government debt, while the ability to expand issuance in the regional government securities
market is limited. In addition, CIP revenues, given their inherent volatility, are susceptible to a
sudden stop; and PDVCAB, which has been a key investor in government securities, would no

longer have resources to purchase government paper if the Petrocaribe arrangement were to
end. Tighter funding conditions would worsen the cash flow situation and push up
arrears/financing gaps. If arrears to suppliers were to increase or spread to wages and debt
service to IFIs and domestic creditors, economic activity could be disrupted, confidence
undermined, and nonperforming loans pushed up in an already weak banking system. In this
context, the risk of a financial crisis, which already exists as long as bank resolution continues to
be delayed, would rise significantly. The main risk from the global economy is a possible
protracted period of slower growth in advanced and emerging economies. This would negatively
affect domestic growth and worsen external balances through a slowdown in tourism and FDI
flows. Heightened geopolitical risks in the Middle East could lead to a sharp rise in international
oil prices with possible negative spillovers on domestic growth and the balance of payments.


Authorities’ views. The authorities were more optimistic about the outlook although they
broadly agreed with the risks. They believed that even if a couple of the private projects in the
pipeline were to materialize, there would be a significant impact on growth. They were very
aware of the risks associated with the CIP, but were confident, given the momentum thus far,
that revenues from the program would be strong, at least for the next couple of years.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
Authorities and staff agreed on the overriding policy issues facing the country, which
revolved around three themes: the urgent need for fiscal consolidation and supportive
structural reforms; immediate actions to address the fragile banking system; and policies
to boost growth and improve competitiveness.

A. The Need for Fiscal Consolidation and Supportive Structural Reforms
Background
7.
The authorities agree on the need for fiscal consolidation. With public debt close to
100 percent of GDP, serious cash flow problems, and limited financing options, they have taken
some early measures to reduce spending but they have not yet outlined any fiscal plan or target for
2014 or 2015. However, they have cut election-related expenditure, and are tightening spending on
goods and services (e.g., lowering rents paid by government agencies; terminating or renegotiating
service contracts with suppliers), and streamlining and/or cutting transfers (especially to government
agencies). The authorities believe that there is a lot of waste in government spending and want to
develop their fiscal adjustment efforts in that area. While supporting the government’s initiatives,
staff indicated that the authorities should ensure that reductions in transfers did not simply move
the problem from the central government to state-owned enterprises. Staff also expressed concern
that the authorities’ measures would take time to fully implement and were unlikely to be sufficient.
In particular, fiscal policy was unsustainable since large financing gaps were likely to persist. In
addition, debt would remain high; and tackling key issues, such as the resolution of the ABI Bank or
the funding of infrastructure investment would be difficult.

Policy Discussions
8.
Because the “current trends” scenario above appears unsustainable, staff proposed a
medium-term fiscal consolidation plan to address cash flow problems, eliminate the financing
gaps, and restore fiscal and debt sustainability (Text table 5).4 Specifically, the plan would be
anchored on achieving a debt to GDP ratio of 60 percent by 2023. This would imply raising the
underlying primary surplus by 2.8 percent of GDP to around 2.6 percent of GDP in 2015 and then to
3 percent in 2016 and maintaining it at that level for the next 8 years.5 Fiscal saving would come
mainly from additional expenditure measures, such as lowering the wage bill through attrition and
wage restraint, but would also include raising taxes. The primary surplus and the available borrowing
room in the regional government securities market would be sufficient to fund the bank resolution
process, preliminarily estimated at around 11½ percent of GDP.6 However, the Debt Sustainability
Analysis indicates that debt would remain fragile and highly vulnerable to a variety of shocks,
including contingent liabilities and low growth.
9.
Staff discussed potential benefits from implementing a strong fiscal adjustment
program in the context of a Fund-supported program. In such a scenario, staff’s recommended
fiscal adjustment in 2015-16 might be somewhat more evenly distributed across the two years. This
is because the strong front-loading of the fiscal adjustment in staff’s active scenario was, in part,
based on the need to close a projected financing gap in the context of limited financing options. On
the other hand, a Fund-supported program would increase the likelihood of new financing from IFIs
to help close the financing gap. In addition, there would be improved prospects for debt
management operations to smooth out debt service payments to bilateral creditors. In any event,
the authorities’ contingency planning should retain a Fund-supported program as a possible option.
10.
To achieve its proposed scenario, staff argued that there was room to significantly
increase mobilization of revenues. Antigua and Barbuda has the lowest tax to GDP ratio in the
ECCU and staff’s analysis suggests that the country has the potential to increase tax collection by
around 4 percent of GDP over the medium term (Appendix IV). In this context, and given the need
to increase fiscal savings, staff urged the authorities not to follow through on their campaign
promise to eliminate the personal income tax. Staff also recommended that the amount of tax
incentives be reduced, emphasizing not only the large revenues forgone but also the economic

4

The macroeconomic projections in Tables 1, 3–5, and 7–10 refer to staff’s proposed scenario. Table 2 reflects the
current trends scenario.
5

Under, staff’s proposed scenario, growth would be lower in 2015 and 2016 than under current trends because of
stronger fiscal consolidation but would be higher over the medium term (Table 1).

6

A more definitive estimate would be obtained from the planned asset quality reviews of the banks (paragraph 19).
The resolution costs comprise filling the capital gap (liabilities minus assets); raising the capital adequacy ratio to the
required 8 percent.

introducing comprehensive tax reform policies to scale back incentives. In contrast, Antigua and
Barbuda passed legislation earlier this year that granted broad tax incentives (i.e., exemption from all
import duties, VAT, and income tax, and large concessions on property taxes) for a wide range of
new investments.
11.
In the area of tax administration, reforms need to improve collection. While efforts had
been made to strengthen revenue administration, there are critical challenges to be addressed. Most
importantly, staff urged the authorities to pass the Tax Administration and Procedures Act, which is
long overdue (structural benchmark in SBA). There is also substantial room to strengthen tax
compliance by improving the exchange of information between the Customs and Inland Revenue
departments. Finally, staff noted that increased efforts were needed to address the high level of tax
arrears, especially by SOEs, which the authorities estimate at 3.2 percent of GDP for ABST (at endJune 2014).
12.
The possibility of strong CIP revenues over the next 12 months should not weaken the
commitment to undertake strong fiscal adjustment measures. Given the inherent volatility of CIP
revenues and the evident cash flow stress, these should first be used for clearing arrears, paying
down debt, and funding the resolution of ABI Bank. Over time, the CIP revenues could also be used
to build buffers and fund key strategic infrastructure projects. Given the increased international
scrutiny on such programs, the CIP should adhere to the highest standards of governance and
transparency, including subjecting applicants to targeted AML/CFT measures and publishing regular
audited financial accounts of the program. Staff expressed concern that application fees for the CIP
in excess of the operating expenses were being retained by the CIP administration unit and not
being turned over to the treasury.
13.
Structural reforms are needed to underpin the recommended fiscal measures,
especially since the fiscal consolidation gains will need to be maintained for several years. The
easing of fiscal policy in the lead up to the election exposed several serious weaknesses in public
financial management and highlighted the need to strengthen the fiscal policy framework in order
to enhance the credibility of the medium-term fiscal consolidation program. Reforms will need to:


Strengthen the revenue forecasting system. In recent years, revenue projections have been
systematically over-optimistic, ultimately contributing to arrears, the rationing of payments, and
poor execution of the budget.



Sort out existing problems in the Free Balance system for tracking revenue and
expenditure flows and make it operational across more government agencies.



Establish a framework to prioritize public investments to ensure that they fit in an overall
envelope consistent with restoring debt sustainability. In recent years, most of the large
capital projects have been undertaken by statutory bodies and it is not clear that they were
vetted to ensure that these were the projects with the largest economic and social returns.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA



Introduce a multi-year fiscal framework and make annual budgets consistent with the
framework. The 2014 PEFA Report recommended establishing such a framework to guide the
government’s strategic plan and improve predictability and control in budget execution.



Scale back the use of special warrants, which have undermined the budget as an
instrument of fiscal policy, to comply with existing legislation.



Underpin the framework by a fiscal rule that clearly prioritizes eliminating arrears and
reducing debt to sustainable levels and also has strong accountability provisions. This is
urgently needed given that the existing fiscal anchor, i.e., the ECCU-wide debt target of
60 percent of GDP by 2020, has not proven to be effective and no longer appears feasible.



Undertake a review of the legal framework to enable the (above) PFM reforms and
ascertain their consistency with the legal environment.

14.
Staff emphasized the urgency of taking stock of the government’s contingent
liabilities and implementing policies to improve monitoring and control. It will be important to
improve oversight and efficiency of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to enhance overall fiscal
performance (Appendix V). In this regard, stronger enforcement of SOE financial reporting
requirements, which were established at the time of the SBA, is required. The state-owned utility
company, APUA, is in urgent need of reorganization to address the ongoing build up of arrears and
cross debts with various public and private sector entities.8 In the area of worker compensation, the
authorities estimate that outstanding liabilities in the form of deferred payments (such as back pay)
amount to at least 3 percent of GDP. The government pension system also should be reformed to
contain rapidly rising costs. Some combination of measures to contain the growth of benefits and
introduce some form of worker contribution may need to be considered. The existence of
potentially large contingent liabilities further underscores the urgent need for a comprehensive
fiscal consolidation plan to reduce debt, and to expand the perimeter of the government’s fiscal
policy plan to encompass the public sector, rather than only the central government.

Authorities’ views
15.
The authorities were confident that their fiscal consolidation effort would be
successful. They acknowledged that some measures, such as closing down certain government
agencies, would require strong political commitment. They believe that with the strong increase in
economic activity from the private investments that they were counting on, there could be a
significant growth in revenues. In addition, they were aggressively exploring options for securing
foreign loans and grants and were also actively engaging creditors to restructure some of their
debts to lower interest rates and/or extend maturities. At the same time, the authorities were
strongly opposed to considering a new Fund-supported program. They believed that the very short
maturity of Fund lending would create new cash flow problems down the road.

8

According to APUA, central government debt to APUA stood at 12.4 percent of GDP at June 2014.

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA

16.
The authorities were opposed to any increase in taxes but outlined a number of
initiatives in the area of tax administration. They considered that the tax burden is already too
high. They are committed to eventually eliminating the personal income tax but agreed that such a
move was not appropriate given the current fiscal situation. The authorities agreed on the need to
scale back tax incentives, but argued that this had to be a medium-term process. Because of the
difficult economic situation, creating jobs was an overriding political priority and tax incentives were
seen as an expedient way to promote this in the short run, notwithstanding the costs. In the area of
tax administration, they planned to extend their professionals tax compliance program to real estate
agents and engineers. On TAPA, they plan to revisit some aspects of the bill, e.g., the proposal
allowing the tax authority to seize bank accounts of tax payers, before re-submitting the bill to
parliament. They broadly agreed with staff’s recommendation on the use of CIP revenues, noting
that the CIP Act prohibited the use of CIP revenues for recurrent spending.
17.
On structural fiscal reforms, the authorities acknowledged that there were problems in
the cash flow management system. They stated that they were taking steps to iron out problems
in the Free Balance system and were also implementing recommendations of the 2012 FAD technical
assistance, including on establishing a single treasury account. In the meantime, the Ministry of
Finance indicated that it was not authorizing any payment requests by ministries for which there was
not a previous advance warrant authorization issued by the Ministry of Finance. On the need to
strengthen the fiscal framework, they noted that the ECCU’s Monetary Council was likely to change
the existing fiscal anchor in the near future. The authorities emphasized their intention to turn SOEs,
including APUA, into profit centers, reiterating plans to implement reforms and cut government
transfers.

B. Strengthening the Banking System
Background
18.
The government intends to expedite the long overdue resolution of ABI Bank, which
has been in conservatorship for three years. At the Prime Minister’s request, Fund and World
Bank staff prepared a proposal that involves a good bank-bad bank structure using a purchase and
assumption (P&A) framework. The P&A would be followed by the near simultaneous withdrawal of
ABI Bank’s license, with remaining assets (NPLs) dealt with in receivership by a professional asset
manager and liquidator. To address potential liquidity pressures and boost confidence, the
government would establish a temporary liquidity facility available to the successor bank. For this
purpose, staff recommended using funds from the Citizenship by Investment Program. The
government was encouraged to actively seek a stronger investor bank, which would bring credibility
to the transaction and contribute to the consolidation of the financial sector. Legislative reforms will

15

ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA

be needed, in particular those being prepared in the context of the ECCB/CDB/IMF/WB regional
bank resolution strategy.9
19.
Despite delays, progress has been made in implementing the regional strategy.
Agreement has been reached in a number of areas; e.g., on AQR, which will start in 2014Q4; and
most legal reforms, with LEG technical assistance. Discussion is ongoing in other areas such as
options to resolve insolvent banks on a least-cost basis and upfront recognition of losses.
20.
Improving the framework for addressing the large stock of non-performing loans
(NPL) will be crucial for successful bank resolution. The difficult economic environment, poor

Policy discussions
21.
In designing the proposal for the resolution of ABI Bank, staff emphasized that the
outcome must be a healthier and more viable banking system that is resilient to future crises.
More specifically: (a) banks should be viable in order to perform a productive financial
intermediation function and be seen as secure places for deposits (i.e., healthy and properly
regulated); (b) the funding and capital structure needs to be sufficient to provide loans to support
economic growth through profitable lending; and (c) the successor bank should not be encumbered
with legacy problems such as NPLs and/or large amounts of government debt that are a by-product
of resolution. Staff stressed the importance of having in place a comprehensive contingency plan,
including an effective communication strategy and adequate liquidity for ABI Bank’s successor bank.

A detailed description of the regional strategy can be found in the ECCU Common Policies staff report (pages 3234). The reforms aim to address regulatory deficiencies indentified by a 2012 Joint ECCB/CDB/IMF/WB Financial
Sector Task force, as well as weaknesses and gaps in the bank resolution framework identified by LEG in 2013/14.

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA

22.
Staff urged the authorities, as a member of the ECCB Monetary Council, to avoid
delays in the AQR process and quickly finalize the draft legislation being prepared in the
context of the regional bank resolution strategy. While the financial situation of ABI Bank was
well known, assessing and addressing problems in other banks in Antigua and Barbuda would need
to await the results of the AQR. On legislation, staff emphasized the importance of the
comprehensive regional reforms currently under preparation.10 The Antiguan authorities will need to
take swift measures at the national level to have the legislation adopted by their Parliament, once
approved by the ECCB Monetary Council. In the event that ABI bank is resolved ahead of the
passage of regional reforms, interim legislative reforms will be needed.
23.
The authorities have made important progress in strengthening the anti-money
laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) framework in compliance
with international standards. This was acknowledged in February 2014 by the Caribbean Financial
Action Task Force (CFATF). Further efforts should now focus on the compliance and effective
implementation of the 2012 FATF standard. In this context, continuous focus needs to be on
preventing financial integrity and security risks related to the newly introduced CIP.
24.
Authorities’ views. The authorities were in broad agreement with the staff’s ABI Bank
resolution proposal and have requested Fund technical assistance to help in the design and
implementation of the strategy. They considered that, from a political and social standpoint, it was
crucial to protect all depositors. They also emphasized that since taxpayers were going to fund the
cost, they should be able to benefit from any upside on the recovery of the successor institution. In
this context, the authorities indicated that, although they had no interest in controlling or managing
the successor bank, they would still want a temporary equity stake, which could be sold
subsequently to realize capital gains and offset some of the incurred costs.

force for the ECCU. The Fund is providing technical assistance in drafting the legislation.

to boost competitiveness, in particular, based on various indicators of declining tourism
performance over the past decade (Box 3 and Appendix VI). The Caribbean Growth Forum has
highlighted the need to improve air, maritime and ICT connectivity, enhance the business climate by
facilitating the creation of new businesses, and improve skills and productivity through better
training and coordination with labor demand. Another key factor in boosting potential growth will
be increasing resilience to natural disasters.
26.
As noted, a key pillar in the authorities’ growth strategy is attracting large private
investment projects in the tourism sector. The authorities expect that the execution of projects in
the pipeline will substantially raise growth, first through an increase in construction, and
subsequently through an expansion in tourism arrivals and positive spillovers to the rest of the
economy, (Text table 4 and Appendix VI).
27.
The authorities have also launched an important drive to boost energy efficiency,
including by boosting the production of renewable energy. The high cost of energy is a key
impediment to doing business (Box 4). Oil imports, which amount to 14 percent of GDP, are also
major source of risk, given the volatility of global prices and the country’s dependence on
Petrocaribe financing. The authorities’ 20-20-20 program seeks to reduce energy costs by
20 percent (including through a comprehensive reform and modernization of APUA) and generate
20 percent of energy from renewable sources by 2020. In other areas, the authorities have initiated
programs aimed at improving key “Doing Business” indicators and building entrepreneurial skills of
the small business sector.

Policy recommendations
28.
The authorities should prioritize achieving macroeconomic stability and strengthening
the banking system in order to establish conditions supportive of growth. Resolving the
government’s cash flow problems and taking decisive steps to achieving debt sustainability are
important not only in their own right but also to create a stable economic environment which will
provide long-term confidence to investors. Similarly, cleaning up the banking system will allow it to
support growth by mediating funds between savers and investors. Investors need to be assured of a
stable, predictable planning horizon, where the banking system is sound, the public finances are
healthy, and the government pays its bills on time.
29.
Staff supported the authorities’ drive to bring new investment to the hotel sector.
About 30 percent of the room stock is outdated and needs investment. The government can help
speed this process of renovation by not subsidizing troubled hotels with government assistance
(allowing them not to pay taxes and utilities). The current owners need to invest or sell the
properties to others capable of making the required capital injections, but have reduced incentive to
do so while they are receiving government support.
30.
To increase cost competitiveness, it will be important to ensure that labor costs are
moderated and wage adjustments do not outpace productivity gains. Given Antigua’s strong
labor union tradition, it is important that unions play a key role in this effort. In addition, an analysis

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA

of labor productivity and unit labor costs should be inputs in collective bargaining negotiations. In
this context, staff urged the authorities to devote resources to compiling labor market statistics,
which are virtually nonexistent, in order to be able to make informed policy decisions. To the extent
that public sector wage settlements set the benchmark for the private sector, the government and
civil service unions will need to exercise restraint in their negotiations.
31.
Initiatives to increase energy efficiency and address other impediments to doing
business are welcome. However, on energy policy, staff did not agree with the authorities’ plan to
have APUA subsidize energy costs while production costs remained above expected post-reform
levels. APUA’s customers should only realize the gains from reduced energy prices when the
efficiency gains are reflected in lower production costs for APUA. Staff cautioned against shutting
down the Antigua and Barbuda Investment Authority (ABIA) without properly transferring its duties
and services to the appropriate ministry. ABIA was working with key partners in the region such as
the Caribbean Growth Forum and Compete Caribbean, and was in the process of setting up a onestop shop to facilitate registration of businesses and investments in Antigua.
32.
Staff urged the authorities to deepen regional collaboration. There is substantial
potential to boost productivity and cost efficiency by better coordination on labor market issues,
energy policies, disaster insurance, and provision of government services to overcome capacity
constraints, and exploit economies of scale.
33.
The government should improve physical and macroeconomic resilience to natural
disasters and climate change. Small islands are particularly vulnerable to natural disaster and
global warming, as Antigua was recently reminded with the encounter with Hurricane Gonzalo in
October 2014. The government could work with the World Bank as part of their Small Island States
Resilience Initiative, or with the Green Climate Fund to build technical expertise and physical
resilience to disasters. At the same time, the government should prioritize lower debt, so that when
a disaster strikes the country has enough fiscal space to accommodate reconstruction expenditures.
34.
Authorities’ views. The authorities are counting on substantial private investment in the
hotel sector, not only to raise the number of hotel rooms, but also to raise the overall quality of the
hotel room stock and increase the overall competitiveness of the Antiguan tourism product. On
infrastructure, they are close to completing an expansion of the airport and are also exploring
funding options for a major expansion of the ports, which could substantially boost their
competitiveness in cruise ship tourism by increasing the size of ships that are capable of docking in
the island. They asked for support from the Fund in finding low-interest long-term infrastructure
financing and in developing frameworks to facilitate innovative methods of project implementation
(e.g., public-private partnerships). To diversify the economy, they want to revive the offshore
financial sector and expressed concern that the various global transparency initiatives were
becoming excessive and were serving more as trade barriers for small states. They believe that there
could be a strong synergy between the offshore sector and the CIP.

Box 3. Competitiveness in Antigua and Barbuda
While standard CGER-type methodologies do not suggest any significant real exchange rate
misalignment, other indicators point to competitiveness challenges. The real effective exchange rate
(REER) has depreciated by around 7 percent since the first half of 2013, largely driven by inflation
differentials. However, the current account deficit has widened since 2012 and remains large. CGER-type
methodologies suggest a range of exchange rate misalignment from -4.2 to 4.5 percent. The results from
the macroeconomic balance and external stability approaches are underpinned by relatively large current
account deficit norms, which reflect the large (negative) net foreign asset position and large oil trade deficit.
Due to a lack of data, it is not possible to compute a cost-based REER, but costs of electricity (Box 4) and
labor relative to Antigua’s competitors are important price indicators of its competitiveness.

The overall ease of doing business in Antigua and Barbuda ranks close to the world average but has
steadily declined in recent years. Its ranking is above most Caribbean economies and also above the
regional (Latin America and Caribbean) average over the past three years. For many years, the areas
highlighted as most challenging for doing business have been registering property and paying taxes. In the
last couple years, getting credit and resolving insolvencies have emerged as issues, most likely associated
with the problems in the banking system. Labor market regulations may also be somewhat of an obstacle to
doing business: while indicators of flexibility of working arrangements compare favorably with other
Caribbean countries, the cost of dismissal is among the highest in the Caribbean.

Box 3. Competitiveness in Antigua and Barbuda (Concluded)
Antigua and Barbuda’s tourism sector has lost competitiveness with respect to their ECCU and
Caribbean peers. This loss took place over the 1990s with Antigua maintaining its ground over the last
decade and experiencing some improvement over the last couple of years. However, the industry is still not
back to pre-crisis levels. Despite having one of the top 20 airports in the Caribbean in terms of number of
flights) Antigua has seen one of the largest declines in flights over the last ten years; and although the
situation is improving, 2013 still showed a decline in the number of flights (see charts below and Appendix
VI).

However, there are some encouraging developments; despite the troubles in the industry the sector
appears to be picking-up. The recent winter season was the best since 2009, airlift is also improving and
there is news of more flights for the coming winter season. The new airport terminal building, the new
Beaches hotel, and some of the other tourism developments in the pipeline will help improve the
attractiveness of Antigua as a tourist destination.

Box 4. High Energy Prices in Antigua and Barbuda
High energy prices have resulted in sizeable economic costs for Antigua and Barbuda. Over the last ten
years, the fuel import bill rose from 6 percent of
Current Account and Oil Imports

GDP to over 14 percent of GDP on account of rising

oil import prices. The increase in the current

The authorities’ 20-20-20 program aims to improve energy efficiency by 20 percent, generate 20
percent of energy from renewable sources, and reduce the carbon footprint by 20 percent by 2020.

 Renewable Energy: Currently, renewable energy is less than 1 percent of the total generated in the
country. The government intends to increase the use of renewables by encouraging private investment
into the sector. To acomplish this it is working on a Renewable Energy Act, and two regulations that will
encourage generation of solar energy among

the World Bank to undertake a comprehensive restructuring of APUA to boost administrative and
operational efficiency. The authorities intend to change the tariff structure and the reference prices used.
The changes will lower prices and eliminate subsidies, allowing for a complete pass-through of
international prices to consumers and full cost recovery. The government is also keen to start charging
each ministry by their electricity consumption, which should result in more efficient energy consumption.

 Carbon footprint: The government intends to target higher fuel efficiency standards for the transport
sector, which should result in a lighter carbon footprint.

POST-PROGRAM MONITORING
35.
Antigua and Barbuda’s capacity to repay the Fund on schedule is highly uncertain
under the current trends scenario. As of September 2014, outstanding debt to the Fund stood at
US$ 80.6 million (6.5 percent of GDP and 15.3 percent of external public debt). During 2015–17, debt
service to the IMF would constitute 48.8 percent of scheduled external debt service obligations.
Under the current trends scenario, arrears on external debt service are projected to continue to
accumulate and financing gaps are projected to widen. In this context, there are significant risks that
arrears to IFIs, including the Fund, could emerge. Under the staff‘s proposed scenario, the capacity
to repay is substantially enhanced. Nevertheless, risks remain, especially if funding from Petrocaribe
or CIP were to be lower than projected. In this context, staff reiterated the importance of fiscal
adjustment and exploring debt management options to smooth out the debt service profile.
36.
Authorities’ views. The authorities reiterated their commitment to the timely servicing of
their Fund obligations and indicated that they would make every feasible effort to meet other
external debt service obligations.

STAFF APPRAISAL
37.
Macroeconomic performance deteriorated in the 12 months following the end of the
SBA in June 2013. The fiscal policy stance was eased leading up to the June 2014 general elections
at the same time that debt repayments jumped sharply and external financing opportunities shrunk.
The resulting cash flow problem already has resulted in the emergence of arrears on external debt
and there have been delays in payments to suppliers. At the same time, longstanding vulnerabilities
related to weak growth, the debt overhang, and unresolved banking problems remain. Without
significant short-term strengthening, current policies appear unviable.
38.
Urgent fiscal measures are needed to address the short-term cash flow problem and
accumulation of arrears. The current situation has a negative impact on confidence, threatens the
provision of key services, exacerbates the problem of securing funding for the budget, and will raise
NPLs, which would worsen the condition of already fragile banks. The authorities have implemented
some measures to reduce spending, including on goods and services and transfers. However, given
the size of the estimated financing gaps, additional fiscal measures are needed, including reducing
the wage bill, improving financial performance of state-owned enterprises, and reducing tax
incentives. The uncertainty surrounding ongoing initiatives to raise additional financing and
restructure existing debt underscores the importance of preparing contingent fiscal measures.
39.
The commitment to restoring debt sustainability over the medium term that began
during the SBA needs to be re-invigorated. The debt sustainability analysis, which is based on
staff’s proposed scenario, points to a high risk of debt distress. Fiscal consolidation measures will
need to be sustained over time. The introduction of a multi-year, medium-term budget underpinned
by a fiscal rule that clearly prioritizes arrears payments and debt reduction to sustainable levels
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

23

ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA

would help support fiscal consolidation and provide credibility to the authorities’ efforts. In addition,
further initiatives to strengthen public financial management will be crucial, especially to improve
cash flow management and reduce the use of special warrants.
40.
Inflows from the CIP should first be used to lower debt pressures. Indeed, the inherent
volatility of these revenues dictates that, as specified in law, they should not be used to fund
recurrent spending. Moreover, they should not deter the authorities from taking the strong fiscal
measures needed to durably restore fiscal sustainability. In this context, CIP revenues should be used
first to pay off arrears and lower the debt, and assist in the resolution of ABI Bank. Given the
increased international scrutiny on citizenship investment programs, the highest level of governance
and transparency should be enforced. In this context, staff strongly recommends that application
fees for the CIP be transferred to the treasury.
41.
The authorities’ commitment to expedite the long-delayed resolution of ABI Bank is
welcome. To be able to move ahead in a timely manner, it will be important for the authorities to
support the regional bank resolution strategy by approving crucial legislative reforms; and ensure
that resources are available to fund the resolution without endangering fiscal sustainability.
42.
The authorities’ efforts to re-energize growth by seeking potential investors are
commendable. If these projects roll out as planned the positive impact on growth could be
substantial. Some of the projects will raise competitiveness in the stay-over and cruise tourism
sectors. At the same time, the authorities will need to be vigilant to ensure that labor costs are kept
under control and that wage adjustments do not outpace productivity. However, labor market
statistics are currently unavailable and need to be produced to guide discussions between policy
makers and stakeholders. Improving energy efficiency and increasing the use of renewable energy
are crucial to improving cost competitiveness. In this context, there is an urgent need to reform and
modernize the state-owned utility company.
43.
It is recommended that the next Article IV Consultation be held on the standard 12month cycle.

Based on August 2014 Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM). The RAM shows events that could materially alter the outlook (both the
current trends and staff’s proposal scenarios). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks
surrounding the scenarios projections (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between
10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability of 30 percent or more). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall
level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.

Appendix II. Growth Impact of the Beaches Hotel Project
The Beaches hotel that the Sandals group is planning to build in Antigua will entail an
investment of about EC$405 million over a period of 18 months starting in mid-2015.
Assuming that half of the investment is done in 2015 and half in 2016, and that only 30 percent of
the total investment is value added to construction activity, this would imply a real GDP growth rate
of 3.3 and 3.6 percent in 2015 and 2016.1 That is, the direct effect of the Beaches construction
project on growth could add 1.9 and 1.8 percentage points, respectively, to staff’s’ growth

Once the new hotel is completed and running it will add some 300 high quality rooms to the
stock of rooms in Antigua and Barbuda (or about 10 percent). Based on the average occupancy
rate of Sandals throughout the Caribbean (including Sandals Antigua) of about
85 percent, that would translate to over 53,000 new tourists per year on the island.2 This would be
reflected in higher growth of tourist arrivals of 12 and 11 percent, respectively, in 2016 and 2017.
This would in turn translate into additional real GDP growth of 1.7 and 1.6 percentage points in 2016
and 2017, respectively. Furthermore, airlift to the island would have to be expanded by about 6-7
new flights per week to accommodate the increase in demand. This improved availability of flights
and schedules will likely have positive spillovers for the entire tourism industry in the country.

Appendix III. PDVCAB Debt and Financing
The governments of Antigua and Barbuda and Venezuela signed the PetroCaribe agreement
in 2005. For this purpose the government of Antigua created PDV Caribe Antigua and Barbuda Ltd.
(PDVCAB). PDVCAB was set up as a privately incorporated company wholly owned by the
government of Antigua and Barbuda and was charged with managing the agreement.
The setup of PetroCaribe in Antigua and Barbuda. PDVCAB imports fuel (diesel, gasoline and jet
fuel) from PDVSA and pays upfront only 50 or 40 percent, and the rest is financed over 25 years
(with 2 years of grace period) at an annual interest rate of 1 percent.1 PDVCAB then sells the fuel to
the local wholesaler in Antigua (the West Indies

interest of about 4.6 percent on its investments, the financial situation of the company is
sustainable.3 However, the large exposure of PDVCAB to Antigua’s government could pose a
problem to the company if the government cannot service its debts on time.
A disruption, conclusion, or change of the agreement entails a serious risk to Antigua and
Barbuda. Currently PDVCAB holds 22.3 percent of Antigua’s outstanding T-bills in the RGSM
market, and 70 percent of its outstanding bonds. It is expected that over the next 5 years PDVCAB
will continue to invest significant amounts in Antigua government paper. Furthermore, it finances
about 1.9 percent of GDP of the current account deficit. Hence a change, or early termination of the
agreement would require new sources of financing for both the government and the balance of
payments, or it will require a rapid and large adjustment to government spending and imports.

3
The 4.6 interest rate is based on very conservative assumptions on the interest PDVAB earns on its investments. By 2021
PDVCAB’s assets will match its liabilities, and by 2030 assets would exceed liabilities by 38 percent.

Appendix IV. Antigua and Barbuda and Small States—Tax
Efforts and Tax Capacity–Scope for Revenue Mobilization
This appendix assesses to what extent tax revenue collection can contribute to fiscal consolidation
efforts. It attempts to answer two questions: (i) Retrospectively, to what extent tax collection has been
efficient; and (ii) prospectively, by how much could tax revenue contribute to fiscal consolidation
efforts? Overall, the results indicate that there is substantial scope for raising tax revenue in small
states, including Antigua and Barbuda. Results show that Antigua and Barbuda has the potential to
improve its tax collection by around 4 percent of GDP over the medium-term.

A. Introduction
Despite debt restructuring in 2010 with a reduction in face value, the public debt ratio is still
above the pre-global crisis level in 2008. During the 2010–13 SBA, efforts to contain public
spending were associated with a significant decline in public investment. Tax revenue collections
were lower than program expectations. This was partly due to tax reform implementation lags and
lower than projected growth. To reduce public debt and boost growth, the authorities will need to
rely more on increasing tax revenue and reducing recurrent spending, while allowing for an increase
in public investment.
Antigua and Barbuda’s tax revenue to GDP ratio is among the lowest in the ECCU. The country
faces limited administrative capacity to raise revenue. At the same time, the proliferation of income
tax holidays and other incentives add to the impediments to achieve higher tax collection. As a
result, tax revenue collections are likely to be below the country’s potential.
The literature on tax capacity and tax effort remains sparse for small states. Furthermore, the
fiscal challenges that Antigua and Barbuda are facing call for better understanding of the realism of
the country’s tax collection effort given its economic fundamentals. To understand what potential
Antigua and Barbuda has to increase the revenue, we estimated a range of tax frontiers in panel
econometric models and evaluated tax potential and tax capacity for economic groups and
individual countries, including Antigua and Barbuda.

The rest of the appendix is organized as follows. Section B will describe the econometric
methodology and results and Section C will conclude.

B. Methodology and Results
A benchmark stochastic frontier tax function is developed. This approach measures taxable
capacity by regressing the tax revenue to GDP ratio for a sample of countries on explanatory
variables that serve as proxies for possible tax bases and other factors that might affect a country’s
ability to raise tax revenue. A stochastic frontier tax function is defined with a reduced form equation
for cross-country panel regression (Coondo et al., 2003; Varsano, 2006). The predicted tax ratio from
such a regression is considered a measure of taxable capacity, i.e., tax revenue potential, while the
ratio of the actual to the predicted tax ratio is then computed and used as an index of tax effort.
The stochastic frontier model is originally based on Aigner, Lovell and Schmidt (1977)1 as follows:
=∝ +xit + vit - uit,

GDPC is the natural log of real PPP-adjusted GDP per capita, which is a proxy for the level of
development. We also include the square of GDPC to account for non-linearity in the elasticity of tax
to income. TAX is the central government tax revenue collection (in percent of GDP), excluding
pension contribution. AGRI is the natural log of value added of the agricultural sector, proxy for ease
of tax collection–and government intention to provide tax exemptions or subsidies. The GINI
coefficient is a proxy for compliance among income classes. EXP is the total expenditure on
education (in percent of GDP) as a proxy for the level of education. TRADE (Exports+Imports)/GDP is
the degree of openness. CORR is the natural log of the corruption index (high correlation with
governance/accountability). INF is the percent change in the consumer price index (annual average,

100=2005). It is a proxy for seigniorage revenue from printing money. POP is the natural log of the
level of population.
The error term in the model has two parts. vit is the country’s time specific idiosyncratic and
stochastic part of the frontier which could be either positive or negative. The second component, uit
represents cost inefficiency, and is positive. The model is usually specified in (natural) logs, so the
inefficiency term uit is interpreted as the percentage deviation of observed performance or a
measure of the country’s “ failure” to produce the relative maximum level of tax collection.
The typical model procedure consists of predicting and measuring the inefficiency term.
Economically, it is defined as the ratio of actual tax revenue to (optimal) stochastic frontier tax
revenue (or tax capacity). Hence, the tax effort is given by:

v

u

The key empirical challenge is to estimate the “inefficiency” term, that is disentangling it from the
estimated error terms where
it = vit  uit = yit - ∝-xit
To do this, we use the JLMS methodology by Jondrow, Lovell, Materov, and Schmidt (1982).2
Estimation results are broadly consistent with the literature. We first estimate a benchmark
model with all variables and all countries in the panel.3 In particular, we include a dummy for each
economic group. With the exception of oil-producer countries, the coefficients associated with all
other country groupings appear to be significant. Moreover, the coefficients of all variables are
generally significant with the expected sign. Overall, the results are in line with findings in the recent
literature (Fenochietto et al., 2013, Davoodi et al., 2007), where higher tax potential is associated
with higher real output per capita, higher degree of openness, higher quality of institutions, less
agricultural value added, and lower inflation. We also estimated other model specifications for each
country group. Various panel Bayesian stochastic frontier models that focus on both parametric and
non-parametric approaches were explored and the models were selected based on which best fitted
the data generation process of each economic grouping.4 Estimated coefficients for the ECCU,
Caribbean, and Small States appear to be in similar ranges. The tax elasticities with respect to

pages 233-238.

The estimation uses a panel dataset that covers 189 countries over the period 1990–2013, with 59 low-income
countries (LIC) , 49 upper-middle-income countries (UMIC), 36 advanced economies (AE), 153 emerging markets
(EM), 12 Caribbean countries, 42 small states.

Contrary to the one-size-fits-all approach, the model selection uses various specifications of production possibility
fronteirs to help identify the data generation process that best fits each country grouping including: true fixed and
random-effect models (Greene, 2005a); maximum likelihood (ML) random-effects time-varying inefficiency effects
models (Battese and Coelli, 1995); and ML random-effects flexible time-varying efficiency models (Kumbhakar, 1990).

income per capita for these country groups are relatively low compared to other regions, notably,
LIC, EM, AE. Advanced countries are near their tax capacity. Caribbean and Small states could
further improve their tax collections by 4.3 percent of GDP to 4.9 percent in the long-run.

Antigua and Barbuda’s tax capacity has remained
broadly stable since 2009. These outcomes reflect
partly sluggish tax-related structural reforms. At the
same time, actual tax to GDP declined slightly (from
18.8 percent of GDP in 2010 to 17.4 percent of GDP
in 2013) reflecting mostly slow growth. As a result,
there has been a small increase in the tax gap.

generally, the results show that low levels of income
and population, and limited capacity to benefit from economic of scale are the main challenges for
small states to substantially raise their tax collection. In addition, efforts to reduce sources of
inefficiencies (tax exemptions, inequality, inflation) and increasing tax base could significantly help
improve tax revenue collection in small states. In Antigua and Barbuda, in particular, in light of
recent mixed performance in implementing structural reforms, the country would need to lift
administrative and structural bottlenecks and strong policy commitment to reap the benefit of high
tax collection.

Appendix V. Antigua and Barbuda: Oversight, Cross-Debts,
and Fiscal Risks Associated with State-Owned Enterprises
This note attempts to highlight some fiscal risks associated with the continuous weak coverage and
oversight of state-owned enterprises (SOEs), and the growing cross-debts among SOEs and central
government. The financial difficulties at some SOEs and the recent increase in government guaranteed
debt of SOEs is an early warning.
Full coverage and oversight of SOEs in Antigua and Barbuda is challenging. Not all SOEs
subject to oversight are complying with the requirement to produce financial statements on a
regular and timely basis. This lack of compliance also includes the absence of a systematic approach
to identify and monitor the creation, dissolution, or sale of SOEs.1
Weak oversight and risk management of the SOEs increases fiscal risks. Only 8 SOEs out of 26
are current on reporting on their financial statements and business plans. The number of SOEs that
have submitted their financial statements at the Ministry of Finance declined from 11 in 2009 to 5 in
2012. Since 2013, eight have committed to be current on their reporting obligation (quarterly
management reports, annual business plans, and annual report and audited financial statements).
This general lack of compliance and absence of enforcement to impose fiscal discipline at SOEs creates
fiscal risks.
Cross-debts and contingent liabilities have

including APUA and ABSS.
The financial situation of the
ABSSB has started
deteriorating since 2013, in
part, due to government
arrears on contributions and
interest. Under current actuarial
provisions, the ABSSB system
parameters are projected to be
unsustainable and the deficit
would widen. Currently, the
monthly operating deficit of
ABSSB is estimated at EC$1.3
million, which was partially offset
by changes in contribution rates
to private and public sector
employees in 2013. The
medium-term deficit is likely to
persist in the absence of
significant changes in the
current actuarial parameters,
particularly the retirement age.

The Antigua Public Utility
Authority (APUA) is also
experiencing financial difficulties. From being a profitable financial centre in the mid-20s, the
APUA’s cash flow turned negative in 2012 following the liberalization of the sector. As consumers,
including central government and many SOEs (e.g., Port Authority, St John’s Development, and the
Airport Authority) , are not current on their bills, APUA’s revenue and cash flow have deteriorated.

Appendix VI. Tourism Sector Competitiveness in Antigua and
Barbuda
This note seeks to give a broad overview of the tourism sector in Antigua and Barbuda. With
tourism being the largest driver of economic activity on the twin island nation it is important to
study the general characteristics of the tourism industry in Antigua as well as its performance
relative to its ECCU neighbors and the broader Caribbean.

A. Characteristics of the Tourism Sector in Antigua
Tourism is one of the largest sectors in the Antiguan economy accounting for almost
14 percent of real GDP. However, the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC) estimates that the
total contribution (direct and indirect) of tourism to the economy is about 63 percent of GDP (WTTC,
2014). This ranks Antigua as the country with the sixth largest tourism concentration in the world,
surpassed only by Aruba (third place) in the Americas.
Tourists Arriving to Antigua and Barbuda

The tourism sector in Antigua and Barbuda is
concentrated in three markets; the United Sates,
the United Kingdom, and Canada. About 77
percent of all stay-over tourist arrivals to Antigua
come from these three countries. The US is the
largest market with 36 percent of all arrivals followed
by the UK. However, over the last couple of years the
Canadian market has been growing strongly with the
introduction of more direct flights from Canada.

Tourist arrivals to Antigua are highly seasonal.
The high season accounts for almost 60 percent of
all the tourist arrivals in the year; it starts around the
end of November and extends until April, usually
around Easter. The worst months are September and
October when on average only 5 percent of annual
tourists arrive to the country. Although, the major
markets show a similar pattern of arrivals, the
seasonality is more marked in the case of Canada
where ¾ of the arrivals come in the high season and
very negligible business is seen over the summer.

The average length of stay in Antigua is about 7 days (a week). But Europeans (7.8 days) in
general and UK travelers (8.8 days) in particular tend to stay longer. Hence, their economic impact
on Antigua is larger than what is reflected in the stay-over arrivals alone. Although the average age
of tourists has been steadily increasing since 2010 the new Beaches hotel that the Sandals Group is

planning will likely reverse the trend. Beaches is a family oriented resort (unlike the Sandals brand,
which is exclusively for couples) that should bring a lot of new young customers.1

The tourism industry suffered an important
blow in the aftermath of the global recession.
Almost four thousand monthly tourist arrivals
disappeared from late 2008 to the end of 2010, and
since then the recovery has been slow and prone to
reversals. And, although recent evidence indicates
that the tourism sector is picking up pace, the level
of tourist arrivals is still far below its 2008 peak of
almost 23,000 arrivals per month. The recent high
season (Nov. 2013 – Apr. 2014) was the most
successful since 2009 and the recovery is expected
to continue.

Sources: Caribbean Tourism Organization; and IMF staff calculations.

Antigua has made gains in other markets vis-a-vis the ECCU; however, overall its market share
has remained flat. Over the last decade Antigua’s share of the ECCU tourist arrivals from the UK
and other Caribbean countries declined substantially, after an initial expansion. This decline has
been compensated mainly by large inroads into the Canadian market where Antigua started to
make up for lost ground at around 2009. Another tourism area where Antigua has done comparably
well with respect to the region is in yachting. However, Antigua’s cruise industry has lost ground in
the region particularly in the last year.

Sandals expects to start construction during the first half of 2015. For an analysis of the potential impact of the new

Although in general all hotels suffered during the global recession, some hotels (mid-size and
budget) did worse. The Antigua Hotels and Tourist Association (AHTA) publishes the occupancy
rates of its members classified by size (large, medium, and small) and room rates (luxury, mid-range
and budget).2 The largest drop in occupancy rates during the global recession was experienced by
mid size and budget hotels. This last group in particular saw a steady decline in its occupancy up to
the end of 2013, when it started to recover. In the meantime most other groups were already
recovering by 2011-12, although currently most hotels still have occupancy rates below the precrisis level.

The current condition of part of the hotel room stock explains the performance of budget
hotels. Different stakeholders (government, the AHTA, and other private sector businesses)
recognized that almost 30 percent of the room stock is outdated and in dire need of investment,
particularly at the lower end of the market, which explains the bad performance of budget hotels.
Fortunately, some of those properties are in the process of being renovated or sold to new

2

Small hotels are those with fewer than 50 rooms, mid size have between 50 and 150 rooms, and large hotels have
150 or more rooms available. The AHTA does not explicitly show the ranges of room rates used to classify hotels by
this metric.

investors, but there are still a couple of hotels that will need a strategy to improve their situation
going forward.

C. Antigua’s Market Share
Despite the emerging recovery Antigua’s tourism sector has lost competitiveness over the last
two decades. Although the share of passengers traveling from the US to the Caribbean has
remained somewhat stable since 1990 at around 11 percent of total US passengers traveling abroad,
the share of passengers going to Antigua (out of total passengers to the Caribbean) dropped from
3.1 percent in 1990 to 1.3 percent in 2012.3 This large drop took place during the 90s with Antigua’s
market shares stabilizing in the last decade. It is important to note that Antigua’s tourist arrivals
grew during the last decade (especially until 2008) while its market share stagnated. This suggests
that the country could have expanded its sector more rapidly if the right infrastructure (i.e. hotel
room stock) and prices had been in place.
Antigua has also lost market share with respect to the ECCU. The ECCU only experienced a small
drop in its share of US passengers relative to the Caribbean; its share went from 4.6 to 4.0 percent
between 1990 and 2012. However, Antigua’s share of the tourism market in the ECCU has seen a
similar decline as compared to the Caribbean; with a sharp decline in the 1990s stabilizing in the
2000s. Antigua went from having two-thirds of the ECCU market to less than 30 percent. This
change mainly reflects the development of the tourism sector in Grenada and St. Kitts. But it is also a
consequence of a more aggressive expansion in St. Lucia whose participation doubled to 38 percent
of the ECCU market over the last 24 years (see charts below).
The loss of market share within the ECCU could be exacerbated in the near future. The new
international airport in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, expected to be operational by the second
half of 2015, will accommodate direct flights from the mainland US, which could rob some of its
ECCU neighbors (including Antigua) of a slice of their US market. Given that the US market is the
largest source of tourists to Antigua accounting for 36 percent of tourist arrivals, the increased
competition from the Vincentian market could further erode the competitive position of Antigua in
the region.

3 The data on US passengers and flights over the period 1990-2013 come from the U.S. Bureau of Transportation
Statistics which records all international flight segments that originate or end in a US airport. They report data on
passengers, flights, and carriers for each origin-destination airport. It is important to note that it is not possible to
identify the final destination of the passengers; the data only show the direct international segment from a US airport
to a non-US airport, so it is possible that passengers who fly from the US to Antigua have as a final destination some
other country in the sub-region.

Regardless of the loss in market share Antigua continues to serve more flights and passengers
per square kilometer than most other Caribbean countries. Antigua and Barbuda has an area of
440 km2 and the average ECCU country has an area of 465 km2 while the typical Caribbean country
has an area of almost 20,000 km2. Therefore, there is an important constraint on the amount of
tourists that Antigua, and the ECCU countries, can service compared to larger Caribbean islands.
While Antigua received almost 300 passengers a year per km2 (the ECCU 150) the Caribbean average
was only 16 passengers. However, the trend also indicates a loss of competitiveness for Antigua; in
1990 the country received almost 100 passengers per km2 more than it does today. Most of the
decline occurred in the 1990s, and over the past 3 years Antigua has seen some improvement.

Other indicators of tourism competitiveness also show a deterioration of the tourism sector in
Antigua compared to the region (Figure 1). While the ECCU and the Caribbean have steadily
gained passengers, the number of people flying to Antigua has remained flat. These trends are also
reflected in the number of flights where Antigua has seen no gains, while the Caribbean has.
Although, the number of carriers serving Antigua is similar to the Caribbean, and higher than for the
average ECCU country, the losses in originating markets within the US (i.e. cities with direct flights to
Antigua) after the global recession has been substantial. At its 2004 peak, there were 14 US cities

D. Price Competitiveness
In terms of pricing Antigua ranks among the more expensive destinations in the Caribbean.
According to TripAdvisor, a one week vacation for one person would cost almost US$5,000
compared to an average of US$3,800 for the Caribbean4. Although it is true that Antigua caters to a
more upscale market than Jamaica or the Dominican Republic, Antigua is still more expensive than
most ECCU countries which tend to attract a similar type of clientele. The only indicator where
Antigua ranks better than its ECCU neighbors, and even better than the Caribbean average, is on the
cost of a round-trip flight from the US (see Figure 2). While meals and tourism attractions
(snorkeling) in Antigua are close to the average, it is the cost of a hotel night (US$526 on average)
which results in Antigua being a costlier vacation spot than most countries in the region.

4
Based on TripAdvisor’s TripIndex Caribbean 2014. Costs include a one week vacation for one person between March 1 and April
30, 2014; including 7 hotel nights, dinner for 6 nights, round-trip airfare, and a half day snorkeling trip.

E. Airlines Servicing Antigua
The main airline serving Antigua has been American Airlines (AA), largely from San Juan
(Puerto Rico) and lately from Miami. Except for a brief period in the late 1990s, AA has been the
airline carrying most US passengers to Antigua. The ebb and flow of the different airlines and
markets that Antigua’s tourism industry has served in the US since 1990 can be seen in Figure 3. In
there it is possible to see the importance of opening new markets like Newark and Atlanta over the
last decade. For example, in 2012 Newark accounted for 22.6 percent of the passengers traveling to
Antigua, and overall the new routes that started in the middle of the last decade now transport 30
percent of all US passengers to the island. The top two charts in Figure 3 also show the change in
AA’s Caribbean hub, from when it concentrated its flights in San Juan in 2002-03 (dark blue shade),
to when it began to phase out San Juan in favor of Miami in 2008 (red shade).1 The charts in Figure 3
clearly show it is vital to expand and diversify both airlines and markets. It is critical to keep and
open new source markets from within the US as well as extend the network of airlines servicing
those markets to reduce dependence and vulnerabilities.

The new airport terminal will improve airlift to the country benefitting the entire sector. The
current terminal facilities are at full capacity, so there is little scope to add new routes or more
flights. Most airlines want to come in between 12 pm and 3 pm because that allows them to go back
to their home market in time to make evening connections to domestic airports. However, there is
little scope to add flights at this peak time, but the new terminal with its expanded capacity will be
able to handle more flights at peak time making Antigua more attractive to existing and prospective
airlines. The opening of the Beaches hotel will also improve airlift to the country, to keep the new
hotel at the average occupancy rate of the Sandals hotels throughout the Caribbean it is estimated
that an additional 6 to 7 weekly flights will be needed (see Appendix II).2

2
This numbers assume that all other hotels maintain their occupancy levels, that is, the new Beaches hotel attracts
new tourist to the island instead of diverting customers from existing hotels.

The dependence of the Caribbean as a whole on one carrier to do most of the airlift to the US
could be problematic. In 2013, American Airlines (AA) transported 27 percent of all passengers
originating from the US to the Caribbean, and with their recent merger with US Airways that market
share would increase to 37 percent. Furthermore, AA and US Airways have 64 percent of the market
to the Caribbean among major US carriers.3 The only major US carrier that had a clear expansion
strategy in the Caribbean over the past two decades was US Airways (see Figure 4); the airline
doubled its share of flights to the region while increasing the share of passengers too. At the same
time all other airlines reduced the share of their operations destined to the Caribbean. Hence, the
AA and US Airways merger could curb the pace of expansion of new routes or more frequent flights,
and their combined presence in the Caribbean could increase airfare prices.

F. Concluding Remarks
Antigua and Barbuda’s tourism sector has lost competitiveness with respect to their ECCU and
Caribbean peers. This loss took place over the 1990s with Antigua maintaining its ground over the
last decade and experiencing some improvement over the last couple of years. There are some
challenges that need to be addressed including a solution to troubled hotels; they will need large
investments to bring them up to date; and the improvement of services surrounding the hotel
industry (taxi drivers, restaurants, etc) that need upgrading to its physical and human capital. Several
stakeholders signaled the need for a sector wide training program in hospitality along the lines of
“Team Jamaica” to enhance the quality of all services provided to visitors to the country.
Despite the troubles in the industry the sector appears to be picking up. The recent winter
season was the best since 2009, airlift is also improving and there is news of more flights for the
coming winter season. The new airport terminal building, the new Beaches hotel, and some of the
other tourism developments in the pipeline will help improve the attractiveness of Antigua as a
tourist destination.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION AND SECOND POST-PROGRAM
MONITORING—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Approved By
Adrienne Cheasty and
Bob Traa

Prepared by the Staff of the International Monetary Fund

Antigua and Barbuda’s debt remains fragile and highly vulnerable to a variety of shocks,
including contingent liabilities, low growth, and unclear fiscal consolidation efforts.1 Public
sector debt, consolidating central government and SOE debts, is expected to decline to
81.2 percent of GDP by 2019 after climbing to 102.6 percent in 2015 to finance the
resolution of the banking system. Large gross financing needs would materialize in 2015
to address the banking problems. The risk of near-term debt distress remains high, given
serious cash flow problems, accumulating arrears, and risks of a financial crisis. The size of
the fiscal consolidation envisaged is substantial, which highlights the challenge of
maintaining the fiscal effort over the medium term.

1

By exception, the “baseline” adopted for this DSA explores the staff’s proposed scenario, because the staff
does not consider the “current trends” scenario as viable (the authorities agree). The authorities have not yet
formulated their own medium-term policy scenario, and when they do, this will become the baseline scenario
for the DSA. Even with the staff’s proposed scenario, the risk of debt distress remains high for some time.

ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA

PUBLIC SECTOR DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Background2
There is one main revision to the DSA compared to the one for the first Post-Program
Monitoring Staff Report (EBS/14/34, Supplement 1). Medium-term growth projections have
been revised down significantly from 3.5 percent in the previous DSA to 2.5 percent.
Cash flow problems have emerged as the reform effort stalled. Strains on government loan
payments are acute and the authorities are having difficulties meeting their current financial
obligations. With a rise in amortization payments and limited external financing sources, arrears
built up (including temporarily to the Fund) reaching 3.1 percent of GDP by end-June 2014. 3
Although arrears to the Fund have been cleared, future payments are at risk.4

Realism of Projections (Figures 1, 2, and 3)
Debt level. The public sector’s debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to peak at 102.6 percent in 2015
(from 94.3 percent and 96.6 percent in 2013 and 2014 respectively) and will decline to 81.2 percent
by 2019, before reaching the ECCU 60 percent debt target by the year 2023. The projected
deterioration of the central government debt ratio in 2014 reflects the settlement of the Half Moon
Bay debt.5 The reduction after 2015 arises from an expected improvement in the primary fiscal
balance owed to average annual CIP revenues of about 1.9 percent of GDP and underlying primary
balances of 3 percent of GDP starting in 2016. .
Growth. The real GDP projections in 2015–19 have been revised downward. Recent projections of
growth outcomes have exhibited reasonable forecast errors, particularly during 2011–13 (Figure 2,
top left panel).6 The macroeconomic forecast is still associated with large uncertainties, tilted slightly
to the downside (see Appendix II in the Staff Report).
Fiscal adjustment. Staff projections target an average primary surplus of 4.9 percent of GDP for the
period 2016-19, assisted by CIP receipts; the underlying surplus is 3.0 percent. However, in 2015 the
2

This DSA uses the Market Access Countries framework; the guidance note of the new DSA framework can be found
at: http://www.imf.org/external/np/pp/eng/2013/050913.pdf.
3

Arrears to Paris Club creditors amounted to US$7 million (or 0.6 percent of GDP) by end-June from US$2.5 million
at end-2013 (or 0.2 percent of GDP). Arrears have also emerged vis-à-vis non-Paris Club countries (Venezuela and
China) as well as the European Investment Bank and the OPEC Fund for International Development.
4

Scheduled debt service payments to the Fund have been made through September 2014, secured by a private
domestic bond of EC$25 million (0.7 percent of GDP). Payments of US$5.6 million (EC$15.1 million or 0.5 percent of
GDP) are due between October and December 2014.
5

The Half Moon Bay settlement amounts to US$40 million (or 3.2 percent of GDP). The government is waiting for
the ruling on their proposed payment schedule.

government would run a primary deficit of 5.6 percent of GDP, reflecting one-time costs to help
resolve ABIB.7 Achieving these primary balances will be a challenge; the headline fiscal adjustment
required by the cyclically-adjusted primary balance (CABP) in Antigua places it at the top decile of
world adjustments (see Figure 2).8 As noted, much of this “adjustment” is the result of windfall
revenues from the Citizenship by Investment Program. The underlying primary surplus of around
3 percent of GDP is much lower and would be in the 3rd quartile of world adjustments.
Financing needs. The public sector gross financing needs will almost double to 17.7 percent of GDP
in 2015 to finance the bank resolution, but then will quickly return to an average of about
11 percent of GDP for the 2016-19 period.
Interest rate profile. As the bulk of future financing is expected to come from domestic sources the
effective interest rate is expected to increase. Through end-2013, the share of public sector external
debt stood at 46 percent with an average interest rate of 3.1 percent and maturities ranging from 5
to 20 years. In the meantime, domestic debt carries an average interest rate of 5.8 percent with
shorter maturities.
Fan charts. The fan charts in Figure 1 highlight the risks surrounding the DSA projections. While
there is the potential for a rapid reduction in the debt to GDP ratio such scenarios have a low
probability. Furthermore, when considering that the probability of positive shocks to the primary
balance is zero (and the historical data supports this assumption) the asymmetric fan chart shows
that risks are mostly tilted to the upside; suggesting that the probability of a higher debt to GDP
ratio in 2019 is more likely than a lower debt ratio.

Shocks and Stress Tests (Figures 4 and 5)9
The stress tests further highlight deep vulnerabilities of the debt profile to various shocks.
Growth shock. A lower real output growth of 1 standard deviation for 2 years starting in 2014
would have a significant impact on the level of gross debt, which would reach 123.7 percent of GDP
in 2016 and although the debt ratio would start to decline afterwards, it would still be above the
2014 level by 2019. This is the result of a deterioration in the primary balance relative to the 2015-16
baseline of about 2.9 percent of GDP. On the other hand, the staff report points to an upside risk to

Excluding the resolution of ABIB the government would have a headline primary surplus of 6 percent of GDP.

with debt above 60 percent of GDP) only 10 percent of those adjustments have been larger as measured by the
headline balance than the one envisaged for Antigua under the staff’s proposed scenario.
9

This section discusses the major sources of debt distress. Given Antigua and Barbuda’s current and prospective
debt structure, the pass-through of the exchange rate is relatively small (compared to growth, fiscal, contingent
liability, and interest rate shocks). It should be noted that the exchange rate shock also makes part of the combined
shock.

growth stemming from possible large investments in the tourism sector. If these investments were
to materialize, the debt to GDP ratio would decline much faster than in the baseline scenario.
Primary balance shock. A shock equivalent to 50 percent of the planned adjustment through 2019
would be equivalent to a deterioration of 2.7 percentage points in the primary balance (from the
baseline scenario) in 2015–16. The debt-to-GDP ratio would be about 4.5 percentage points higher
than the baseline on average over 2015–19, and gross financing needs would also be about 2.5
percent of GDP higher than the baseline over the same period.
Interest rate shock. This stress test assumes a permanent increase in the nominal interest rate by
200 bps starting in 2015.10 Higher borrowing costs would slow the decrease in the debt-to-GDP
ratio, which ends up 5.3 percentage points higher than in the baseline in 2019, at around 86.6
percent.
Combined macro-fiscal shock. A combination of the above shocks generates unsustainable debt
dynamics. In this case, the debt-to-GDP ratio would reach 123.4 percent of GDP in 2019 (from 119
percent of GDP in 2015) and continue to rise thereafter. Similarly, gross financing needs would
exceed 25 percent of GDP by 2019.
Contingent liability shock. The sizeable contingent liabilities of the banking and public sector still
remain a significant source of risk to debt sustainability. Despite the lack of detailed information,
many SOEs are facing debt management and financial problems (e.g. APUA, the Airport Authority,
and St John’s Hospital). If the government was required to assume 10 percent of banks’ total assets
(excluding banks recapitalization11) through a one-time bail out, the debt-to-GDP ratio would jump
to 141.6 percent by 2016 before declining to 128.6 percent by 2019, and gross financing needs
would be about 15.8 percentage points above the baseline (on average). 12

EXTERNAL PUBLIC SECTOR DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
ANALYSIS
Gross external financing needs are expected to remain high in the medium term to service the
debt from Paris Club and the Fund (Figure 6 and Table 1). External debt was revised upward by
4 percent of GDP in 2013 to account for borrowings from China for the airport terminal. Over the
medium term, SOEs debt is assumed to remain around 18.6 percent of GDP to account for their
difficult financial situations. This is consistent with the deteriorating current account projection,
10

It could be associated with market concerns about the credibility of policies to bring down debt that could
increase the sovereign risk premium. It is assumed that this higher borrowing cost will not depress growth.

11

The contingent liabilities associated with bank resolution have already been incorporated into the debt projections
starting in 2015.

12

The DSA framework standard stress test on contingent liabilities assumes 10 percent of banks’ assets are borne by
the government (directly through non-interest expenditure). The scenario also implies a real GDP growth shock of a
1-standard deviation for 2 years.

growth slowdown and less optimistic outlook of foreign direct investment inflow. Most of the
consolidation is expected to be done on domestic debt. While external debt remains resilient to an
interest rate and growth shock, it is highly vulnerable to adverse current account or depreciation
shocks. Gross external financing needs are expected to remain high, although on a declining path, at
about 16 percent of GDP on average in 2014–19 as Antigua and Barbuda starts to service their debt
from Paris Club and the Fund.

Conclusion
The analysis indicates that the debt-to-GDP profile under staff’s proposed scenario is sustainable
but subject to a high risk of debt distress. The debt trajectory shows a steady decline after the
banking sector is resolved, but it entails substantial headline fiscal adjustments that will be
challenging to sustain over time, and that rely heavily on the volatile Citizenship by Investment
revenues. Furthermore, finding the resources to finance the banking system resolution in 2015 will
be a challenge, given the government cash flow difficulties; which could be exacerbated if
PetroCaribe flows are disrupted. Thus, the outlook for public debt remains fragile and is vulnerable
to shocks, particularly contingent liabilities, and growth and fiscal shocks.

ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA

As of August 31, 2014 Antigua and Barbuda has outstanding obligations to the Fund of
SDR54.84 million, or 406.3 percent of quota, arising from cumulative disbursements under the
Standby Arrangement. The last Article IV Consultation was concluded by the Executive Board
on October 17, 2012. Missions from the Caribbean Regional Technical Assistance Centre
(CARTAC) and the Fiscal Affairs Department (FAD) have visited Antigua and Barbuda since
2006 to assist in strengthening revenue collection, public financial management, CPI
compilation and balance of payments statistics. Antigua and Barbuda is a member of the
Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB), which manages monetary policy and the exchange
system for its eight members. The common currency, the Eastern Caribbean dollar, has been
pegged to the U.S. dollar at the rate of EC$2.70 per U.S. dollar since July 1976. Antigua and
Barbuda has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, and maintains an
exchange system free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current
international transactions.

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
(As of July, 2014)
World Bank Group OECS Regional Partnership Strategy: In June 2010, the Board of
Executive Directors of the World Bank discussed a joint Bank/IFC Regional Partnership Strategy
(RPS or Strategy) for the six independent countries of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean
States1 (OECS). The Strategy covers a five year period (2010-14) which coincides with the
duration of the election cycles in all six countries, although the timing of the elections in the
countries is not aligned. It sets forth the terms of engagement of the International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), the International Development Association (IDA) and
the International Finance Corporation (IFC) with the countries of the Eastern Caribbean, subregional organizations and other development partners in pursuit of the following strategic
objectives: (a) building resilience; and (b) enhancing competitiveness and stimulating growth
over the medium term. A Progress Report that assesses the implementation of the Strategy at
the mid-term and outlines how the Bank will position itself strategically for the remainder of
the RPS period has been presented to the Board in May 2012.

To help build resilience, the Bank Group supports interventions aimed at promoting fiscal and
debt sustainability, protecting and improving human capital—particularly social safety nets,
education and health—and strengthening climate resilience. To help enhance competitiveness
and stimulate sustainable growth, it focuses its support on two critical areas: strengthening the

While the OECS comprises six independent countries and three British Overseas Territories, the RPS covers only
the six independent countries, namely: Antigua and Barbuda; Dominica; Grenada; St. Kitts and Nevis; Saint Lucia;
and St. Vincent and the Grenadines. Excepting St. Vincent and the Grenadines which did not join IFC, all are
members of the World Bank Group.

countries’ domestic financial sectors and improving access to quality services to create more
competitive business environments.
The RPS is also providing remedial measures to address the crippling effects of the global and
regional crises, while supporting key policy reforms that establish a platform for growth in the
medium term. The program of support entails new commitments totaling up to about
US$120 million on IBRD terms for the six independent countries and up to US$73 million of
IDA (depending on their Country Policy and Institutional Assessment-CPIA) for the four eligible
OECS (Dominica, Grenada, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines) which are also eligible to
IDA (“blend” countries).
The WBG is currently working on the new OECS RPS which will cover the period FY15-19, and
is expected to be presented to the Board by the end of 2014. The high-level objective of the
new RPS will be to contribute to lay the foundations for sustainable inclusive growth, in line
with OECS government priorities. In order to achieve this goal, the program is planned to be
organized around three main themes. Under the first theme, the WBG is planning to support
competitiveness. Growth and job creation in the private sector will be supported both
horizontally – by improving the business environment and, in particular, contributing to a
sound financial sector – and vertically – by focusing on specific sectors with a high potential to
generate inclusive sustainable growth (including tourism, agriculture and their respective
linkages). The second theme is public sector modernization, with particular focus on public
financial management (PFM) and institutional capacity, including for statistical capacity
building and public private partnerships (PPPs), to better leverage private investment in
infrastructure and service provision. The third theme is resilience to systemic vulnerabilities,
and focuses on building social, economic, fiscal, and disaster risks resilience.

A. Projects
Currently, the WBG portfolio in Antigua and Barbuda consists only of a US$10 million
investment loan, for a Public Sector and Social Transformation (PSST) project, first WBG
lending engagement ever in the country, approved on June 5, 2013. The operation is aimed at:
(i) strengthening government capacity in managing public policies and the public service; (ii)
improve the efficiency of social protection spending through an integrated monitoring and
targeting system; and (iii) improve the income and the employability of vulnerable population
through temporary employment and training programs.
In addition, there is an active Institutional Development Fund (IDF) grant on Enhancing
Efficiency in Personnel Expenditures, which supports activities aimed at achieving a fiscally
sustainable wage bill. The Bank also conducted a Social Protection Assessment, for which
consultations on the findings and recommendations outlined in the Assessment were carried
out in late June 2011.

RELATIONS WITH THE CARIBBEAN DEVELOPMENT
BANK
(As of June 30, 2014)
The Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) has supported the economic and social development
of Antigua and Barbuda (AB) since its inception in 1970 by financing priority capital and
technical assistance (TA) projects and by engaging in policy dialogue with the Government.
Over the years, CDB’s involvement with AB has been mainly concerned with activities such as:
formulation and implementation of macroeconomic, social and sectoral policies; development
of economic and social infrastructure to facilitate growth and economic diversification; and
direct and indirect lending to the productive sectors. At the end of June 2014, CDB had
approved loans totaling USD136.6 million (mn) to AB, of which USD38.2 mn was undisbursed.
Net resource flows to AB have been generally positive but were negative in 2009, 2012 and
during the first half of 2014. Table 1 provides a summary of CDB’s net resource flows to AB
over the period 2009 to the first half of 2014.

As at June 30, 2014.

Major current capital projects currently under implementation include the following:
1.

Policy-based Loan – intended to support policy and institutional reforms in the areas
of macroeconomic management; expenditure and debt management; revenue
enhancement; and social transformation. It is also expected to help the Government of
Antigua and Barbuda (GOAB) restore fiscal and debt sustainability by closing the
financing gap through a combination of financing from the International Monetary
Fund and CDB, as well as a comprehensive debt restructuring.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

2.

Fleet Modernization Project – is a loan to be on lent to LIAT (1974) Limited for use in
its fleet modernization, which is expected to result in an improvement in the airline’s
financial performance and operational efficiency. The age of the fleet of aircraft had
posed a significant risk to the airlines viability and the socio-economic benefits
accruing to AB and the wider Caribbean, particularly the support provided to the
tourism industry.

3.

Basic Education Project II – is aimed at enhancing the education sector by improving
access quality and effectiveness of education at the pre-primary and secondary levels.
It will also entail enhancements of the learning and teaching environments; school
management and institutional effectiveness; and planning and management of the
sector.

Major TA projects currently under implementation include the following:
1.

Functional and Efficiency Reviews of Government Ministries – is intended to provide an
analytical framework with recommendations and action plans to assist GOAB to
rationalize and restructure the public service to increase efficiency and effectiveness in
the delivery of services.

2.

Institutional Strengthening of the Framework for Development Planning and
Management – is aimed at assisting GOAB to undertake a review of the current
development planning framework and make recommendations to strengthen its
operation and provide training to staff involved in the planning process.

3.

Medium-term Development Strategy – is intended to provide GOAB with a
development strategy to guide socio-economic development and accelerate economic
growth over the medium-term.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As on November 7, 2014)
I.
Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance.
Most affected areas include the national accounts, labor market statistics fiscal, financial
information on state-owned enterprises, and balance of payments statistics.
Real Sector Statistics: The national accounts were rebased to a more recent year (2006) in
accordance with the methodology of the 1993 System of National Accounts in 2010. The
rebasing has led to significant improvements in the revised GDP estimates in current and
constant prices, along with broader data coverage, conceptual and methodological changes,
and improved estimation procedures.
The ECCU also rebased the national CPI to a more recent year (January 2010) and the new
index was published in December 2010. The new basket of goods and services (e.g., owneroccupied housing, cell phones, MP3 players, and college tuition and expenses) and
expanded samples of outlets improved the CPI by reflecting current patterns in consumer
purchases, making it more representative of the entire country.
There is no comprehensive labor force survey and thus little coverage of labor market
developments. An Annual Wages and Hours Worked Survey for the private sector were
conducted in 2003, although the coverage of Barbuda was limited. The latest population
census was conducted in 2011 and preliminary results were released in February 2012.
Government finance statistics: Annual and quarterly data on central government finances
published by the ECCB are compiled broadly in line with the methodology set out in the
1986 Government Financial Statistics Manual. To better understand the underlying fiscal
situation of member countries, the ECCB has agreed that the ECCU would implement the
methodology of the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001). Work is in
progress in this area.
Monetary statistics: Monetary statistics are compiled by the ECCB on a monthly basis with
a lag of six weeks. In November 2009, an STA mission helped the ECCB develop report forms
(returns) to collect monetary data from non-bank financial institutions in an effort to expand
the coverage of the Other Depository Corporations Survey (ODCs) to include mortgage
companies, finance companies, building societies, credit unions, and development banks.
The mission also helped develop a financial corporations’ survey, which would include other
financial corporations (OFCs) such as offshore banks, trust companies, mutual funds, money
service firms, and insurance companies. The ECCB has developed an action plan to
implement these recommendations. Source data for commercial banks do not provide the
desegregation recommended by the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual and
Compilation Guide. Close coordination between the ECCB and the single regulatory unit

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA

(which supervises financial corporations other than those licensed under the Banking Act) is
crucial. The ECCB is currently working in implementing a new reporting system for
commercial banks that is envisaged to address the recommendations made by the April
2007 data ROSC mission. It is expected that the new reporting system would be
implemented in 2015.
Balance of payments: The ECCB is preparing new BOP survey forms, which will include
trade in services and provide a better coverage of foreign direct investment. In the mediumterm, the improved forms will allow for the presentation of the BOP in the Extended Balance
of Payments Services (EBOPS) and for the preparation of the International Investment
Position (IIP). However, due to delays in updating the software to reflect changes made to
the survey form, the launch of the new survey forms has been postponed. On Balance of
Payments and International Investment Position, the ECCB has been encouraged to use
Microsoft Excel, as an interim solution to process the information. They have agreed and the
new forms are scheduled to be implemented in early 2015.
II.
Data Standards and Quality
Antigua and Barbuda participates in the Fund’s General Data Dissemination System (GDDS)
since October 2000. Its metadata is posted the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin
Board and updated since October 2, 2002 (http://dsbb.imf.org). Metadata and plans for
improvement for most of the categories (except central government debt, depository
corporations survey, and external debt and debt service schedule) have not been updated
since December 2010.
A data ROSC mission was conducted in April 2007; however, the report has not been
published.
III.
Reporting to STA
Annual national account statistics are provided to the IMF for publication in the International
Financial Statistics (IFS). STA staff converted quarterly fiscal data currently available in the
ECCB website into the GFSM 2001 format and, with the authorization of the authorities,
disseminated this dataset in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook (GFSY, annual
data) as well as in the IFS (quarterly data). In July 2006, the ECCB started reporting
monetary and financial statistics to the IMF in accordance with the methodology of the
Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM 2000); the associated data have been
published in the IFS since September 2006. The ECCB reports annual balance of payments
statistics for dissemination in the Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook (BOPSY).
However, Antigua and Barbuda does not report trade data for publication in the Direction of
Trade Statistics Yearbook (DOTS).
