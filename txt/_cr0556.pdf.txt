Staff Report for the 2004 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2004 Consultation with Spain
Approved by Michael Deppler and G. Russell Kincaid
January 19, 2005

•

Consultation discussions were held in Madrid during October 27–November 8, 2004.
The staff team comprised Messrs. Leipold (head), Hoffmaister, Catalán, and Guajardo
(all EUR), and Messrs. Spilimbergo (FAD) and Vázquez (MFD). Mr. Carstens, Deputy
Managing Director, joined the mission for the final meeting. Mr. Moreno (OED) also
participated in the meetings. The team met with Vice-Prime Minister and Minister of
Economy Solbes, Bank of Spain Governor Caruana, other senior officials, and
representatives of financial institutions, the employers’ association, labor unions, and
major political parties.

•

Following elections in March 2004, a new government, led by the Socialist Party, took
office. Its majority is dependent on various small left-wing and regional parties.

•

Spain maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on payments and transfers for
current international transactions, except for those maintained solely for the preservation
of national or international security, and notified to the Fund under Decision No. 144(52/51); Spain has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4
(Appendix I).

•

The authorities held a press conference on the mission’s concluding statement
(http://www.imf.org/external/np/ms/2004/110804.htm) and indicated their intention to
publish this staff report.

prices, with fuel-dependent transportation sector price increases substantially outpacing those
in the euro area. Price increases have also been marked in sheltered services sectors. The
cumulative headline (core) inflation differential with the euro area since EMU qualification
in 1997 amounts to about 7 (8½) percentage points; this margin does not appear to have been
offset by productivity gains, though data on the latter are weak.1 The associated real
appreciation contributed to a plateauing of exports to the euro area, with some losses in
specific markets (Figure 3), and a continued compression of export margins. The external
current account deficit is estimated to have widened to some 4¼ percent of GDP in the first
half of 2004 (Table 2).
3.
The boom in house prices and the sharp increase in household indebtedness
have continued unabated. With a sixth consecutive year of double-digit percentage
increases in 2004, house prices have virtually doubled in real terms since 1997. Mortgage
credit—almost exclusively at variable rates—has also continued to grow at a rapid pace
(around 25 percent in 2004). Relatedly, household indebtedness has overtaken euro area
levels, exceeding 70 percent of GDP in 2004.

The authorities agreed that there was scant evidence of a Balassa-Samuelson effect, as
productivity growth in Spain appeared to lag that of the euro area (¶27). Further efforts to
advance research on the nature of the inflation differential have been hampered by delays in
planned data improvements, now expected in the spring of 2005 (for earlier analysis, see
Country Report 03/40).

Policy conditions have been
accommodative. In particular, real interest
rates have been in negative territory for some
three years, spurring strong credit demand.
The general government is estimated—
excluding one-off accounting adjustments
amounting to 0.8 percent of GDP2—to have
recorded a slight surplus in 2004, implying a
mildly stimulatory stance (Table 3). The
strength of social security contributions has
continued to ensure a comfortable social
security surplus (slightly under 1 percent of
GDP), more than offsetting the deficits
recorded by the central and subnational
governments.

II. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
5.
Early in the tenure of the new Socialist-led government, the discussions—in
addition to reviewing policies to ward off short-term risks—focused on the
government’s announced priorities of fiscal stability, transparency, and productivity
enhancement. In large part, the direction of policies in Spain has been in line with Fund
advice (Box 1). Building on this record, the discussions sought to safeguard essential
elements of achievements to date (notably the stability-orientation of fiscal policy), secure
continued progress in initiatives underway (e.g., with respect to greater transparency), and
assign higher priority to areas still largely on the drawing board (first and foremost, pension
reform). Overall, the discussions were marked by a high degree of agreement, though
policies in several areas remained to be defined and mixed signals, affecting policy
cohesiveness, had emerged on some fronts.
A. Cyclical Outlook and Risks
6.
The authorities were somewhat more sanguine than staff on the outlook. There
was agreement that domestic demand (particularly consumption and construction) would
remain robust and that net exports would continue exerting a drag on growth. Overall,
however, the authorities expressed greater confidence in the economy’s ability to weather the
oil price rise and to gather steam going forward, and pointed in particular to evidence of a
long-awaited pickup of investment in machinery and equipment. They noted that the negative
contribution of the external sector thus also reflected the buoyancy of imports of capital
2

The authorities—in the name of greater transparency—made a number of one-time
adjustments to the general government accounts in 2004, corresponding primarily to the
assumption of the debt of the railway operator, RENFE (see Appendix II).

Box 1. Spain: Policy Recommendations and Implementation
Policy implementation in Spain has for several years been largely consistent with Fund
policy advice, and based on a stability-oriented fiscal policy and structural reforms in
labor and product markets. Fiscal policy has largely avoided the procyclical responses
that the Fund saw as a potential risk in case of a rigid implementation of the Budgetary
Stability Law. Improvements have been made in the strengthening of fiscal reporting
and monitoring but these still fall short of what is needed, particularly at the
subnational level.
A series of structural reforms have appreciably improved the workings of labor and
product markets. Political and institutional constraints have, however, stood in the way
of two long-advocated measures: comprehensive pension reform, key to long-term
fiscal sustainability, and of the land supply and zoning process to improve its
responsiveness and transparency. In addition, growing regional responsibilities in
several areas have limited the central government’s reach, inter alia complicating the
implementation of competition policy.

goods. The discussions took place at a time of marked uncertainty regarding oil prices and
exchange rates, and some of the differences in perspectives reflected different underlying
assumptions. The authorities recently revised their 2005 growth projection downward, albeit
only marginally, to 2.9 percent (from 3 percent in the 2005 budget)—still above staff
(2.7 percent), but with both projections around estimates of potential growth.
7.
Staff saw a greater risk of inflation persistence. The updated Stability Program
(end-December) raised the official projection for inflation in 2005 to 3.1 percent (as
measured by the private consumption deflator). Staff however remains less sanguine, as
backward-looking wage indexation—affecting three-quarters of contracts—stands to exert
pressure on wage costs. Given relatively high year-end inflation, a significant proportion of
the revision clauses is likely to be triggered, risking second-round effects from the oil price
increases.3 Furthermore, the pervasiveness of such wage indexation, along with the lack of
effective competition in sheltered services sectors—where the income catch-up process is
prompting relatively stronger demand pressures—risks contributing to the stubbornness of
inflation.

3

At the time of writing, there is also an ongoing debate on the indexation of the minimum
wage.

Oil price developments were seen to cloud prospects, particularly given Spain’s
relatively greater oil dependency. The authorities were nonetheless cautiously optimistic,
both on future oil price movements and on their impact on the economy. They noted that the
effect on growth (and inflation) of higher oil prices was being mitigated by the appreciation
of the euro—which, they acknowledged, presented risks of its own.4 On the policy response
to higher oil prices, they

(which were seen as less able to pass on cost increases), while reassuring staff that the
measures would be limited and temporary, and that similar calls from other sectors would be
resisted.
9.
The main domestic risk to the recovery is posed by the continued boom in house
prices and the high level of household indebtedness. With house prices continuing their
unrelenting rise, there was a greater readiness than in the past, both in private and official
circles, to recognize that the prolonged boom had led to measurable overvaluation (Box 2).
The authorities were inclined toward the lower range of available estimates, and saw the
degree of overshooting as remaining within the bounds that would allow for an orderly

4

The authorities estimated that a 10 percent increase in oil prices would reduce growth by
about 0.1 percentage point in a year, at unchanged ECB interest rates; the impact would be
twice as much if interest rates were to rise by 50 basis points.

Box 2. House Prices Overvaluation and Impact on Consumption
The Bank of Spain uses two models to study the housing market.1 The first model posits that the observed real house
price can be split into its long-run equilibrium value and a short-run deviation, with the equilibrium determined by real
gross disposable income (per person older than 24), and the nominal interest rate on household mortgage loans. The
second model posits that the observed price-rental ratio can be split analogously, with its equilibrium determined by
the expected net present value of household consumption and (the growth in) house rents. The explanatory variables are
derived from long-run projections of a reduced-form model (augmented by staff to include employment).
These models were re-estimated using data through 2004:Q3. The results suggest that house prices may be overvalued
by 20 and 30 percent respectively in the most recent period (text figures A and B) and remain within the range of
historical deviations. It should be noted, however, that the second model could overstate the overvaluation to the extent
that rental rates are subject to administrative controls, which could result in an undervaluation of rental prices. Also, the
net present value of consumption might be underestimated due to structural changes in the economy.

Assessing the potential impact on private consumption of a return to long-run equilibrium requires a macroeconomic
model and specifying the adjustment scenario. Here, however, the impact is illustrated by using the consumption
equation of the Bank of Spain’s quarterly model2—assuming an unchanged macroeconomic scenario—for two price
correction paths. Figure C illustrates the cumulative impact from a correction path in real house prices similar to that
experienced in 1992–96, when real house prices fell by about 20 percent (with more than half of the adjustment in the
first year). This historical pattern of adjustment was applied to both models: the first illustrating a correction of 20
percent (12 percentage points in the first year, Model A) and the second depicting a correction of 30 percent (18
percentage points in the first year, Model B). The model suggests that consumption would decline by about 0.3 (0.5)
percent in two years in Model A (B).
Figure D depicts the cumulative effect of a more gradual decline in real house prices (1.0 and 1.5 percent real decline
per quarter for 20 quarters in Model A and B respectively). In this case, consumption declines by about 0.1 (0.2)
percent after two years in Model A (B).

correction. They recalled the various fundamental factors driving house prices (historically
low real interest rates, lengthened mortgage maturities, Spain’s relatively later “baby boom,”
high immigration, and strong nonresident demand),5 and saw them as providing a reasonable
degree of reassurance. They thus continued to hold the view that the situation was not yet
alarming, but would become so if current trends were to persist. Staff noted that, with no
signs of abatement in underlying trends, this view was becoming more tenuous.6
Furthermore, given Spain’s high degree of home ownership (85 percent), real estate assets
now account for more than 80 percent of household wealth, heightening the possible adverse
effects on consumption from a price correction. Staff estimates (Box 2) put such effects at
between 0.1 and 0.5 percent over two years, but these should be viewed as a lower bound,
since they do not include the indirect macroeconomic effects that may work through income
and employment—construction represents 12 percent of employment and 8 percent of
GDP—nor possible financial sector strains.7
10.
The government’s main response to the house price boom has consisted of
measures to promote the underdeveloped rental market, along with increased
investment in social housing. In July 2004, the government adopted a so-called “shock
plan” (Plan de Medidas Urgentes) to address the situation in the housing market. The plan
focuses on measures to promote the rental market as a viable alternative to home ownership
(mainly via subsidies for young renters and preferential credit lines to refurbish rental
properties) and on an increase in the supply of social housing. It also sets up a new
intermediation and information agency to promote rental activity (Agencia Pública de
Alquiler) and a panel of experts charged with proposing reforms to the legal framework
(whose limited protection to landlords was recognized to smother rental supply). While
looking forward to the outcome of the latter work, staff saw the plan as not addressing
fundamental problems in the housing market, notably: the distortions arising from arbitrary
regulations governing developable land, and the unequal fiscal treatment favoring home
ownership (at an annual budgetary cost of 0.4 percent of GDP). The authorities agreed on the
importance of these issues but also stressed their complexity: the availability of developable
land was closely linked to local authority financing, while established tax relief could not be
easily changed or even (as suggested by staff) phased out without risking adverse sideeffects, including disruptions to construction activity (Spain’s comparatively robust supply
5

In concluding the 2003 Consultation, the Executive Board had noted that “the boom in
housing prices and rising household indebtedness—although driven by structural factors and
not posing an imminent risk—cannot continue unabated without increasing the potential for
an adverse fallout” (Public Information Notice No. 04/31, 4/2/2004).

The impact is small also due to the low incidence of mortgage equity withdrawal, and the
moderate sensitivity of private consumption, by EU standards, to nonfinancial private wealth.

response was seen as a distinct strength to be preserved). They nonetheless saw possible
room to address the tax issue in the broader context of personal income tax reform (¶14).
B. Fiscal Policy
The near-term stance
11.
The 2005 budget is designed to reflect the new government’s economic priorities
of continued fiscal stability, productivity enhancement, and transparency. The budget
targets a small general government surplus (0.1 percent of GDP), the same as that set in the
previous government’s Stability Program. On the revenue side, it contains no major tax
initiatives, other than an adjustment of personal income tax brackets for inflation and small
increases in taxes on alcohol and tobacco products. On the expenditure side, the ceiling on
central government spending is set at a level that maintains a constant expenditure-to-GDP
ratio, an objective the authorities viewed as key to securing fiscal discipline. However, they
noted that the composition of spending had been tilted in favor of initiatives designed to
enhance productivity (notably spending on R&D, education, and public infrastructure). The
budget also announces various initiatives to enhance competition and improve the regulatory
framework in product markets.
12.
The budget documents include a number of innovations designed to further
enhance transparency of the central government accounts. A fiscal Report on the
Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC) mission in mid-2004 concluded that, thanks to
steps taken over the last several years and recent initiatives, Spain now fully meets or
exceeds the Fiscal Transparency Code’s standards in many areas (see separate ROSC report,
forthcoming). The Article IV mission welcomed, in particular, the inclusion in the 2005
budget of a reconciliation of budget and national accounts presentations and of information
on potential risks emanating from certain public enterprises, as well as the intended close
attention to be paid to contingent liabilities associated with private-public partnerships.8 Staff
noted, however, that the announcement of a large multi-year investment project outside of
the budget process (for national roadworks) ran against the grain of these initiatives.
13.
The 2005 budget implies a mildly restrictive fiscal stance. The budget’s target of a
general government surplus of 0.1 percent of GDP is the same as the estimated outcome for
2004 (excluding one-off adjustments), making for a mild fiscal withdrawal. Despite slowerthan-budgeted real growth, staff saw higher inflation as likely to raise nominal GDP growth
8

Spain is one of the ten countries selected for pilot case studies on public investment and
fiscal policy following the Executive Board seminar of April 2004, on which the Board will
be informed in the spring of 2005. The issue of strengthened monitoring and reporting of

even above the budget assumption. A larger-than-targeted surplus (in the order of 0.3 percent
of GDP—Table 3) was, in staff’s view, thus both possible (thanks in particular to the
continued strength of social security contributions, sustained by a planned further
regularization of illegal immigrants) and desirable. The persistent inflation differential, the
real estate asset boom, and the presence of overly easy monetary conditions for Spain all
militated in favor a larger surplus. The authorities intended to let the stabilizers play toward a
better outcome if that was forthcoming; staff encouraged a proactive approach in this
direction.
14.
The authorities intend to revamp the personal income tax to broaden its base
and simplify the framework. Although no decisions had been made (and measures were
likely only toward the end of the legislature, after a process of open public debate),
consideration was being given to the possibility of a flat tax—including a moderately high
exemption, and possibly a surcharge for higher income levels. The authorities estimated that,
with the reduced tax rate under consideration, revenue neutrality would require a
reassessment of tax deductions. Staff viewed the proposal with interest and looked forward to
its further specification.
Changes to the Budgetary Stability Law (BSL)
15.
While recognizing the contribution of the Budgetary Stability Law—which
enshrines balanced budgets at the different levels of government—to promoting a
culture of fiscal stability, the authorities intend to introduce a number of modifications.
The authorities agreed on the importance of a disciplining fiscal framework for the
maintenance of hard-earned fiscal stability. They highlighted the usefulness of several of the
current framework’s core elements, particularly the ceiling on central government spending,
the contingency fund to deal with unforeseen circumstances, and the dedication of any social
security surplus to the pension reserve fund. Nonetheless, they saw a need to modify the BSL
with the promulgation of a new law (to be dubbed Budgetary Stability and Transparency
Law) with a view to providing explicit scope for countercyclical action, increasing
observance by the regions in a highly devolved system, and enhancing fiscal transparency.
At the time of the mission, various working groups were examining alternative options; no
final proposals have as yet been put forward.
16.
A first intended modification is the reformulation of the BSL’s annual “balanced
budget” target as “balance-over-the-cycle,” to avoid the risk of procyclical fiscal policy.
Past Fund advice has called for a flexible implementation of the BSL to take due account of
cyclical developments.1 The authorities were considering various ways to best achieve this
goal, ranging from using pre-established formulae to compute the cyclical position and the

fiscal stance, to a less structured system largely forgoing rules in favor of case-by-case
judgments by a panel of experts. While mindful of the technical difficulties, staff favored a
system governed by pre-specified, clear rules covering (a) the desirable medium-term target
(which, due to the fiscal costs of aging, it saw as a small surplus—see ¶21), and (b) the
cyclical adjustment to this target, subjecting the resulting assessment of the cycle and the
related structural fiscal position to public scrutiny. It pointed to Chile and Switzerland as
providing potentially interesting country cases where fiscal objectives are expressed in
structural terms and the methodology is clearly defined and publicly available.2 In this vein,
it also encouraged setting up an independent, non-partisan agency to monitor budget
assumptions and developments.
17.
The authorities also intend to enhance ownership to strengthen adherence to the
BSL by lower levels of government—essential given their large share of total spending.
Following considerable expenditure decentralization, territorial entities now account for over
70 percent of public expenditure

authorities noted that, in the BSL’s

Furthermore, several regions had
challenged the constitutionality of
the BSL, perceived as impinging on their autonomy, and there was a risk of a legislative void
if the appeals were accepted. The authorities thus saw a need for a greater degree of “buy-in”
by the regions. Staff, while recognizing the importance of ownership, was concerned by the
political economy forces at play in a situation in which the government depends on small
regional parties for its majority, and cautioned that changes to the BSL be pondered
carefully.

10

Similarly, the U.S. Congressional Budget Office provides a detailed step-by-step
derivation of the “standardized” and cyclically adjusted deficits on its website.

11

Only the regions of Cataluña and Valencia had required adjustment plans. In monitoring
the BSL, subnational fiscal balances are expressed as a percent of national GDP rounded to
one decimal point (2nd column of text table). Staff noted that this method favored smaller
regions, and advocated measuring fiscal outturns in relation to regional GDP.

18.
A key concern is how to effectively secure discipline at lower levels of
government in a highly devolved political and institutional setting. There was agreement
that, in such a setting, full use would need to be made of all available instruments (see
Selected Issues paper). Among these, the authorities saw scope for increasing regional
revenue-raising powers, strengthening the authorization process for subnational borrowings,
and introducing an explicit no bail-out clause. Regional authorities could also consider
improving budgetary processes—by including, for example, expenditure ceilings and
contingency funds (as at the central government level)—was also viewed as holding promise.
19.
A related issue is that of the potential shortfall of transferred national revenues
relative to devolved non-discretionary expenditures, notably on education and health.
National officials were unconvinced that any of the mandates were “unfunded.” A possible
exception was health, whose financing the government has undertaken to review in the
course of 2005. A separate issue is the cyclicality of transferred revenues (which are based
on revenue-sharing of national taxes, and thus related to actual GDP) in the face of the
relative rigidity of expenditure on education and health. The authorities did not view this as a
pressing matter, noting that—with a total share of such expenditures ranging between 60 and
70 percent of regional budgets and with scope for efficiency gains—there was a margin for
regions to adjust under most plausible scenarios. They also emphasized that the transfer
system was designed to strengthen the incentives toward greater fiscal discipline, and were
keen not to undercut those efforts. While supporting these objectives, staff noted that, in any
revision of the BSL, it would be important to ensure that the framework was cyclically
robust. To this end, consideration might be given to making the transfers to the regions

- 14 -

proportional to trend (or potential) rather than actual GDP. This would serve to limit cyclical
swings in regional revenues and hence spending, thus reducing the scope for regional
borrowing or procyclical policies, and help underpin the feature of the present system
whereby regions should always aim to achieve budget balance.12 To the extent that—as
appears to be the case in some of the proposals under study—regions would no longer be
held to a “zero” budget balance, staff saw merit in the build-up of regional stabilization
reserves (“rainy day funds”) to provide savings for unexpected revenue shortfalls.
Dealing with the fiscal consequences of aging
20.
Although the fiscal costs of aging are generally recognized, the focus has so far
been mainly on the build-up of the pension reserve fund, with substantive action on
pension reform continuing to be postponed. The sharp declines in fertility rates and
increases in life expectancy are driving the demographic transition to an older Spanish
population (Figure 4). The fiscal

(Table 4).14 The authorities saw the

to build consensus on a reform agenda, but staff noted limited implementation of this agenda

Under such an arrangement, the anticyclical role would be essentially retained by the
central government. The role of countercyclical fiscal policy at subnational level was studied
extensively in the context of the U.S. in the 1970s when the fiscal role of states was
becoming more relevant. The conclusion of this debate was that the countercyclical role
should remain in the hands of the central authorities (see inter alia Wallace Oates, Fiscal
Federalism, 1972, and Selected Issues paper).

the course of 2005, in the context of ongoing work by the EU’s Economic Policy Committee.

- 15 -

recent years, fueled by the sharp increase in the number of contributors since the late 1990s
and its coincidence with a small cohort of pensioners. The authorities confirmed their
intention to continue to devote such surpluses to the pension reserve fund, which is set to
approach 3 percent of GDP in 2005 (equivalent to some four months of benefits), resisting
pressures for increased social spending and/or a generalized reduction of social security
contributions.
21.
While welcoming the build-up of the reserve fund, staff pressed that
comprehensive pension reform be moved up on the policy agenda. Spain’s demographic
profile implies a peak in the dependency ratio in about 40 years with a subsequent
reduction—at however a still relatively high level. In these circumstances, it appears
reasonable to “pre-fund” the transitory impact through fiscal adjustment and to implement
pension reform to ensure the longer-run sustainability of social security. Staff thus saw fiscal
adjustment as a complement to, and not a substitute for, pension reform. On the first count,
staff advised setting a moderate structural fiscal surplus as Spain’s medium- to long-term
fiscal target; the Stability Program updated in late December 2004 indeed envisages a
gradually rising surplus, to slightly above the previous program’s target for 2007 (to
0.4 percent of GDP) and extending the same to 2008 (Table 5). On the second count, staff
encouraged the authorities to move ahead with reforms of the pension system that would
increase the effective retirement age (primarily by changing the provisions governing early
retirement) and further align contributions and benefits (by extending the base period used to
compute pensions to life-long earnings). The authorities noted that, following the raising of
this period from 8 to 15 years in 1997, its further lengthening was controversial; gradually
raising the minimum contribution period was seen as likely to be a politically more
acceptable route. There was recognition that aging, along with other factors (including
immigration), would place pressures also on healthcare spending—as already apparent at the
subnational level, where regions with an above-average share of the elderly face aboveaverage health costs (Figure 4). The authorities saw as immediate priorities addressing some
particularly costly aspects of the pension and healthcare systems (notably surviving spouses’
pensions, and abuses of disability pensions and extended sick leave). They also favored
crafting a social pact on healthcare reform, along the lines of the Pacto de Toledo, as part of
the upcoming review of the system’s financing.
C. Banking Sector Developments
22.
The banking system continues to display a strong financial position, helped by
the favorable macroeconomic environment and the rebound of economic activity in
Latin America. The authorities noted that the quality of bank assets had improved from
already strong levels, with non-performing loans (NPLs) falling to a record low of 0.6
percent of gross loans, and provisioning surpassing 250 percent of NPLs. Although
capitalization ratios have been eroded somewhat by the increase in risk-weighted assets as
credit portfolios expanded, the Basel ratio remains above 12 percent (Table 6). In recent
years, the strong expansion of credit has surpassed the growth of deposits, inducing banks to
search for alternative sources of financing, including cross-border interbank credit, asset

The authorities’ assessment was that

rate hikes of up to 300 basis points before experiencing loan repayment difficulties—an
increase they viewed as unlikely in current circumstances. Bank provisioning (in excess of
€20 billion) was seen to offer a reassuring additional cushion.
24.
The continued growth of mortgage credit—almost exclusively at variable
rates—was nonetheless viewed with concern. This was particularly the case with respect to
credit to real estate developers, who in the past had faced difficulties when the real estate
market had cooled off. The Bank of Spain has issued repeated calls for prudence, but felt

that, beyond such moral suasion, there was little that could be done directly to rein in the
expansion of credit. Prudential controls were seen to be operating adequately, and the
authorities did not see a role for a tightening of such controls for cyclical credit management
purposes. They put the emphasis

25.
The governance of the savings banks (cajas) is being strengthened by the
ongoing implementation of new legislation. This legislation, approved in 2003, greatly
reduced the presence and role of political appointees in the cajas’ governing organs. It also
strengthened the cajas’ governance through the mandatory creation of Investment and
Compensation Committees, which are entrusted with the approval of, respectively, new
strategic investments and remuneration policies and their disclosure. Furthermore, beginning
in 2004, the cajas—as well as all companies issuing publicly traded instruments—are
required to publish an annual report on corporate governance. Staff welcomed these
developments, stressing the need to remain vigilant, given a continued proclivity of political
parties to attempt to influence cajas’ decisions when important local issues are at stake.
26.
The authorities are well-advanced in defining new accounting and reporting
norms for deposit-taking institutions. The Bank of Spain had issued a draft circular, for
public comment, revising accounting norms with a view to adoption of the International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as from 2005. The circular provides new regulations
governing asset classification and provisioning, risk measurement, reporting standards, and
rules for consolidating financial conglomerates. On provisioning, although the circular
envisages merging generic and “statistical” provisioning, the authorities emphasized that the
countercyclical feature of the system—which they valued—would remain.1 The adjustment
also imply some relaxation of provisioning parameters and tightening of classification rules.
16

Statistical provisioning was introduced by the Bank of Spain in June 2000. Such
provisioning is designed to cover expected losses on the basis of long-run experience over
the cycle and, therefore, to mitigate the cyclical impact of specific provisions on banks’
profit and loss accounts.

- 18 -

Although the net effect on the level of provisions will depend on the specific characteristics
of individual bank portfolios, the authorities expected some initial freeing up of resources for
the system as a whole. In response to staff queries on whether this was timely, the authorities
noted that the amounts involved were of a magnitude unlikely to have a macroeconomic
effect, and that the timing was at all events dictated by the required adoption of International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) in 2005.

Significant progress has been
made in improving the functioning of the
labor market since the late 1990s, thanks
to a series of labor market reforms. This
is evident even in some traditionally lagging

the employment rate among older workers.
While these trends have moved Spain closer

significantly behind key Lisbon Objectives.

Experience to date with the implementation of the 2002 reform of the
unemployment benefits system has been mixed. The reform was designed to promote
active job search and greater geographical mobility, in the face of a very high regional
dispersion of unemployment rates. Although formal observance of the reform’s “return-towork” requirements appears high (e.g., all unemployment beneficiaries have signed so-called
activity contracts), there remain doubts about its practical implementation—in terms of
effective job search assistance and the application of sanctions—by the public employment
agency. On the other hand, the reform has provided the possibility of side-stepping the
protracted dismissal process, entailing an effective reduction in dismissal costs. This involves
(text figure) declaring at the outset that a dismissal is unjustified, thereby avoiding the
payment of “procedural” wages (salario de tramitación) during the prolonged settlement
process. At any event, employers viewed recourse to court proceedings as largely ineffectual,
as roughly three-quarters of all labor rulings favored the employee.

Recent trends were seen to provide confidence in a gradual improvement in
female employment rates. The authorities acknowledged that the root causes of Spain’s low
female employment rate—in comparison, for example, to the relatively higher rate of
neighboring Portugal—were not well-understood, with some observers attributing it also to
working hours that hamper balancing work and family commitments. They observed
however that female labor market participation had grown steadily, following reforms that
increased the flexibility of part-time work, established tax incentives for the creation of
workplace childcare centers, and granted tax rebates for working mothers. The authorities

Fixed-term contracts account for about 30 percent of total employment, compared to a

Reducing the prevalence of fixed-term contracts to improve the quality of

important role of the construction sector, where fixed-term contracts are widespread. Also,
there had been a steady increase in the use of such contracts in the public sector, particularly
at the municipal level. The authorities saw merit in continuing along the path of the 1997

- 21 -

reform, extending the applicability of contratos de fomento to a wider range of sectors, while
also rooting out abuse in the stringing of consecutive fixed-term contracts. The mission
stressed the need to focus on the primary cause of the high recourse to fixed-term contracts,
namely the considerably higher dismissal costs and rigidities of open-ended contracts. This
wedge needed to be reduced by lowering the latter, rather than—as suggested in some
quarters—rendering fixed-term contracts less attractive.
32.
The wage negotiating framework is also part of the ongoing social dialogue and
of potential importance to productivity developments. Staff reiterated the need for reform
of a collective bargaining system that generates a high homogeneity of wage increases across
sectors, skills, and regions, and is insufficiently attentive to relative productivity
developments, dampens incentives to human capital accumulation, and discourages
geographical mobility. Its institutional features also lead to an almost exclusive focus on the
nominal wage award, at the expense of other key features that could help raise productivity
(the flexibility of work organization, specific performance-related incentives, training, etc.).
The authorities noted that the social dialogue agreement, while recognizing the importance of
this issue, left it exclusively in the hands of the social partners.
33.
Immigration has become an increasingly important dimension of the Spanish
economy, particularly evident in the labor market. The government has approved a plan
to regularize a large number of immigrants in the course of 2005. Although there was
uncertainty regarding the number of illegal immigrants, rough estimates place the upper
bound in the range of 1.2–1.3 million (about 3 percent of the population).18 The actual
number likely to be regularized, however, was markedly less. The mission stressed that this
heightened the importance of creating a flexible and adaptive labor market to ensure a
smooth and efficient absorption of immigrants.
Product markets
34.
While competition in a number of key product markets has advanced, obstacles
to effective competition in retail distribution persist. Strengthened competition in key
product markets has entailed notable price declines, and the full liberalization of the
electricity and gas markets has advanced further. Going forward, the authorities intended to
modernize the Competition Law, strengthen regulatory agencies, and liberalize professional
services. At the same time, they recognized that competition in retail distribution—an area
where subnational governments have jurisdiction and have erected a series of restrictions—
remains wanting, accounting in some instances for a widening of retail margins. Lack of
competition in this sector was viewed as all the more worrying in light of evidence that a
large share of the productivity differential between the U.S. and EU countries lies in the
18

This estimate stemmed from the fact that there were some 2.4 million immigrants
registered at the municipal level—a requisite to benefit from public education and health
services—and only about 1.1 million were (legally) registered in the social security system.

- 22 -

distributive trades.19 While the devolution of competencies in this area limited possible
action by the central government, the authorities saw the EU Directive on Services in the
Internal Market as providing an opportunity to address entry barriers throughout Spain. In
this regard, staff was critical of the government’s recent decision to lower minimum opening
hours, noting that it reversed earlier efforts toward complete liberalization. The authorities
recognized that the decision was a compromise in the face of legal recourse by certain
regions, and stressed that the provision did not prevent regions from adopting more liberal
regimes than the minimum indicated.
E. Other Issues
35.
The authorities noted progress in increasing energy efficiency and complying
with the Kyoto Protocol. The goal is to increase the share of renewable sources of energy to
12 percent by 2012 (text table). Progress has been made in the generation of electrical power
but less so in heating, and adjustments were under consideration to achieve the overall goal
as envisaged. These efforts are complemented by an
Medium Term Energy Targets
energy conservation strategy geared toward reducing

projected energy use by 7.5 percent by 2012. The

36.
The authorities saw a successful completion of the Doha trade round as key to
sustained world economic growth, and in this context supported the 2003 reform of the
Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). The reform will begin to be implemented in Spain as
from 2006, while however maintaining the maximum permissible coupling of aids with
production—an approach questioned by staff. Spain has furthermore expressed public
reservations vis-à-vis reform initiatives affecting sugar and Mediterranean products. These
would convert a large share of farm subsidies from production to income support, which the
authorities expected to lead to a decline in sugar beet, cotton, and olive oil production, and
possibly a significant change in the rural economy.
19

Studies suggest that up to 50 to 75 percent of the productivity differential in market
services between major EU countries and the U.S. is accounted by the distributive trades
(wholesale and retail). This is attributed to the ability of large discount stores to use
information technology intensively and to save costs from large-site operations and just-intime inventory management (see Adair Turner, “What’s wrong with Europe’s economy?,”
2003).

- 23 -

37.
The authorities expressed their commitment to counter money laundering
(AML) and the financing of terrorism (CFT). They reported on progress in implementing
EU AML Directives, notably in the area of identifying individuals and activities, including
the extension of reporting duties to new categories (including currency couriers and
lotteries), and a strengthening of reporting requirements. The authorities stressed their strong
commitment to CFT, given also Spain’s unfortunate experience of terrorist attacks, but noted
limits to such activity, since devastating acts of terrorism could be perpetrated with relatively
limited funds: it was estimated, for example, that the Madrid attacks of March 2004 had cost
under €10,000.
III. STAFF APPRAISAL
38.
Spain’s economic performance remains remarkably strong. Output growth and
employment creation have been brisk, enterprises and banks have strengthened their balance
sheets, and the fiscal accounts are in good health. The outlook is for continued economic
growth in excess of the euro area average.
39.
There are however clouds on the horizon, primarily in the form of inflation and
housing market developments. The unbalanced nature of the recovery—largely
consumption-led—and its related demand pressures in services sectors, where competition
remains inadequate, is contributing to the stubbornness of inflation. Higher oil prices and
backward-looking wage indexation are also set to prolong inflation and further erode
competitiveness. At the same time, the unrelenting rise in house prices and household
indebtedness—while driven by a number of fundamental factors—has raised the economy’s
vulnerability to adverse developments.
40.
The government’s priorities of fiscal stability, transparency, and productivity
enhancement are well-placed. In various areas, these priorities now need to be translated
into concrete measures to deal with both immediate and longer-term challenges and risks.
41.
The persistent inflation differential and booming housing market, together with
the presence of easy monetary conditions for Spain, argue for fiscal restraint. The 2005
budget target of a 0.1 percent of GDP surplus implies an only mildly restrictive stance. A
better outcome is both possible and desirable, and should be pursued proactively by
containing central government spending below the budget ceiling, safeguarding the
contingency fund for truly exceptional circumstances, and fully saving the expected social
security surplus. For their part, regional governments will need to adhere firmly to their
commitment to balanced budgets.
42.
Longer-run fiscal sustainability also requires pension reform. While moving to a
larger-than-targeted fiscal surplus in 2005 and beyond would help toward dealing with the
fiscal consequences of aging, fiscal restraint is not a substitute for comprehensive pension
reform. The Pacto de Toledo has served to build consensus on a reform agenda, but progress
has been disappointingly slow. If enacted promptly, reform measures could be phased in
gradually, with relatively muted immediate effects, thus avoiding the need for more radical

- 24 -

action as the demographic shock nears. For while this shock is further removed in time in
Spain than in other EU countries, it stands to be considerable. Reforms will need to aim for a
gradual increase in the effective retirement age and an improved alignment of benefits and
contributions. Features of the system which perversely encourage early retirement also need
to be corrected, with a potentially powerful growth-enhancing effect.
43.
Spain needs a strong budgetary framework, and the prime objective of changes
to the Budgetary Stability Law must be the promotion of greater overall fiscal
discipline. Spain has been well served by a disciplining framework, with the BSL legally
enshrining the objective of fiscal stability. Nonetheless, the authorities are seeking
improvements by providing explicit room for countercyclical action, strengthening the
framework’s persuasive element, and increasing ownership and observance by the regions.
These are complex issues, and changes to the BSL should be pondered carefully, shielded
from political pressures, and guided by sound general principles. These establish that a
model fiscal framework be well-defined and transparent: to this end, it should be governed
by pre-specified, clear rules covering the desirable medium-term target, the methodology
used to determine observance “over the cycle,” and—importantly—the fiscal relations with
subnational governments.
44.
Any fiscal framework needs to take account of Spain’s constitutional reality in
which hard enforcement mechanisms for subnational governments are largely
unavailable. In this setting, the arrangements should be cyclically robust over time, and
designed with the objective of ensuring that the regions consistently aim at budget balance,
avoiding a build-up in subnational debt. All admissible means to contain risks of fiscal laxity
need to be drawn upon. Among such means, the regions could usefully arm themselves with
the budgetary instruments that have proved their worth at the central government level,
notably an expenditure ceiling and a contingency fund. There is also a role for increased
regional revenue-raising powers, to enhance local accountability, and for a more effective
use of borrowing authorizations. Independent agencies reporting their assessments of
budgetary developments and trends to national and regional parliaments could also play a
useful role in bolstering the fiscal framework’s effectiveness.
45.
Ultimately, however, enforcement will need to rely largely on dissuasive peer
and public pressure, whose exercise requires the highest degree of fiscal transparency,
as recommended by the fiscal ROSC. A rationale for decentralization is that proximity
breeds greater efficiency and accountability, but this holds only if the public is adequately
informed about the state of local finances. In this light, a critical ingredient—a sine qua
non—of any change to the fiscal framework embodied in the BSL must be increased
transparency of the subnational governments’ fiscal accounts. This should include timely
publication of data on regional budget execution and, more generally, the pursuit of a degree
of transparency similar to that being commendably sought at the central government level.
46.
Fundamental problems affecting the housing market remain to be addressed. A
resolution of these problems will require bolder measures than those contained in the
authorities’ plan, and aim in particular at (i) phasing out the unequal fiscal treatment arising

- 25 -

from generous tax relief that favors home ownership and weighs heavily on the budget;
(ii) changing a legal framework that is prejudicial to rental activity; and (iii) reforming the
regulations governing developable land that limit its supply. Until these key issues are dealt
with resolutely, other measures will likely have only a palliative effect.
47.
In the labor market, earlier reforms are bearing fruit, but further action is
needed to approach the still distant Lisbon Objectives. The intense immigration to Spain,
which has contributed to the strong growth performance of recent years, requires an adaptive
labor market for its smooth and efficient absorption. The outcome of the ongoing social
dialogue should be unequivocally in this direction. The response being sought to Spain’s
uncommonly high rate of temporary employment contracts should thus be guided by the
principle of increasing labor market flexibility, with the primary avenue being a reduction in
the rigidity and high dismissal costs of standard open-ended contracts. There also remains a
need for changes to the collective wage bargaining system, with a greater attention to relative
productivity and non-wage aspects of work organization that could contribute to the desired
improvement in the economy’s productivity performance.
48.
In product markets, the emphasis on increased competition in various areas is
well-placed. A continued sore point remains that of the various restrictions to effective
competition in retail distribution imposed by the subnational authorities who have
competence in the matter. Such barriers have costs for the regions themselves, in terms of
their relative attractiveness for investors, consumer welfare, and economic performance. The
opportunity provided by the EU Directive on Services in the Internal Market should be
actively pursued to remove entry barriers throughout Spain.
49.
Commercial banks and cajas are recording increasingly positive results, but the
continued expansion of real estate-related lending has raised vulnerabilities. The Bank
of Spain’s ongoing vigilance in this area is well-placed. Also important are the steps to
ensure that the system is in a position to flexibly offer financial products that could facilitate
the response to a prospective rise in interest rates. In other areas, Spain is commendably
well-advanced in defining new accounting rules for deposit-taking financial institutions, and
the strengthening of governance in the cajas has proceeded, helping to increase the
protection against unwarranted political interference. The planned conduct of a Financial
Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) in 2005 is welcome.
50.
Spain is encouraged to build on the increase in Official Development Assistance
(ODA) in 2004 and move closer to the 0.7 percent of GNP benchmark. Spain’s support
for trade liberalization is welcome, and the authorities are encouraged to actively promote
the completion of the Doha Round, including by supporting the flexibility needed on
agricultural trade issues. Spain’s data are adequate for effective surveillance, although the
quality of productivity data and the frequency and timeliness of regional fiscal data need to
be improved (Appendix III).
51.

It is recommended that the next consultation be held on the standard 12-month cycle.

1/ General government defined by ESA-95.
2/ The figures for the years 2020, 2030, 2040, and 2050 are also annual changes with respect to the preceding year.
3/ Reflects the most recent official long-run projections for social security expenditure dating from 2001.
4/ Defined as: r = interest rate; π = GDP deflator, growth rate; g = real GDP growth rate.
5/ Reflects official projections in 2001, which are consistent with the social security expenditure projections.
6/ Defined as the ratio of the population aged 65 and older to those aged 20-64.
7/ Real appreciation is approximated by nominal appreciation against U.S. dollar plus increase in domestic GDP deflator.

APPENDIX II

2004 Adjustments to Fiscal Accounts
Three main changes were made:
• RENFE debt. To comply with new railway legislation coming into effect in December
2004—whereby the construction and operation of railways are to be managed by distinct
entities—capital transfers will be used to pay off 80 percent of the operator’s (RENFE)
debt.
• RTVE debt. To recognize the debt of the heavily indebted public radio and television
corporation (RTVE).
• Argentina loan. To write-off partially the 2001 bilateral loan to Argentina was charged in
2004; smaller charges are envisaged in 2005–06.
In addition, the central government settled Andalucia’s disputed debt from the subnational
financing agreement in place before 2001. This affects the composition of the deficits but not
the general government balance

APPENDIX III

Spain: Statistical Issues
Areas for improvement include:
• General government. Historical revisions, preliminary estimates, and planned fiscal
accounts data should be made available to the public shortly after being sent to Eurostat in
March and September. In addition, major revisions should be fully documented. Although
the 2005 budget included a reconciliation of the budget and national accounts
presentations, details could be added to further clarify the reconciliation. Details of these
calculations would enhance monitoring at higher frequencies. The statistical nature and
impact of a large multi-year investment project for national roads, announced to be
outside the budget, should be reflected appropriately in the statistical treatment of general
government accounts.
• Territorial governments. The timeliness of fiscal outcomes improved with the publication
of 2003 fiscal balances on September 14, 2004, but expenditure and revenue details
remain wanting. The importance of monitoring fiscal developments at the territorial level
is heightened by considerable expenditure decentralization, and recent deviations from
their fiscal targets, and is essential for the implementation of the Budgetary Stability Law.
• Labor market. Two different measures of unemployment are reported by the authorities
(so-called “registered” and “survey” unemployment), which vary substantially. Data on
employment growth are distorted by the flow of workers from the informal to the formal
labor force, which complicates the calculation of productivity growth and hence unit labor
costs.
• National Accounts. These have been revised in line with the 1995 version of the European
System of Accounts, but pre-1995 data have not been revised yet.

Statement by Moises Schwartz, Executive Director for Spain
and Pablo Moreno, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
February 9, 2005
Our authorities appreciate the candid and constructive dialogue held with the staff during the
Article IV mission. The staff has produced a high quality set of papers that provide a very
useful contribution to the economic policy debate and the ongoing reform agenda; the
authorities will take careful note of their comments.
ECONOMIC PROSPECTS
In 2004 the Spanish economy grew around 2.6 percent. Unemployment rate has continued its
downward trend and it is now at 10.38 percent, the lowest since 2001. In 2005, the authorities
are projecting GDP growth at 2.9 percent, slightly higher than staff’s estimate. A larger
contribution to growth from investment and a lesser drag of the external sector will
contribute to this improved short-term prospect. The sharp acceleration on equipment
investment registered in the second half of last year is expected to keep its pace in 2005
sustained on strong domestic demand, accelerated exports, favorable financial conditions,
and the realized need for technological renovation.
The Consensus Forecast for inflation in 2005 is now in the range of [2.5, 3.0]; our authorities
expect that CPI inflation will be on the lower limit. Latest data on January HIPC inflation
already reflects a downward trend, and updated information on wage indexation also
indicates more moderation than expected. Additionally, the combination of better balanced
pattern of growth, a mitigated impact of higher oil prices, and the effects of the appreciation
of the euro, point to a more benign inflation forecast.
POLICY FRAMEWORK
The new government that took office last April has designed an economic policy framework
structured around three basic axes:
Budgetary stability: there is a firm commitment to ensure short- and medium-term
budget consolidation as the basis for sustainable growth. This commitment is founded on a
widely spread recognition within the public opinion and across political actors of the benefits
of fiscal stabilization. Efforts will focus on strengthening the Budgetary Stability Law (to be
renamed Budget Stability and Transparency Law, BSTL) by introducing two new elements:
(i) applying the principle of stability over the cycle, thereby avoiding procyclical fiscal
policy; and (ii) strengthening the transparency of the fiscal framework and anchoring its
observance through all levels of government. Staff’s comments have largely focused on this
area.


A boost to productivity: Spanish strong economic growth in the past few years has had a
major drawback: the weak contribution of productivity to growth. The new government has
put in place a strategy that should serve the goal of boosting productivity growth. This


-2strategy is built around a combined action in multiple fronts including: increasing public
spending in education, R&D and technological innovation, reinforcing competitiveness in
product markets, labor market reform, improving the investment climate, and modernizing
the Competition Authority.
Transparency and quality of the regulatory framework: the new government has
embraced a widespread application of the principle of transparency as a central element to
enhance the efficiency of the public sector and to foster a predictable framework for private
agents. The principle of transparency has already been applied to areas such as the budget,
economic data provided by the government (recently approved guidelines require on-line
availability of economic and financial data to be provided according to predetermine
calendars), good-governance practices in the public sector (a new Code of Good Governance
has been approved), and enhancing the transparency of regulatory procedures (which will
have to be accompanied by an assessment of their economic rationale and budgetary impact).


This triple-axed policy framework is to be developed in an environment characterized by
shared economic responsibilities between central and regional governments. The 1978
Spanish Constitution provides a framework that allows territorial authorities to assume
competence over a number of economic policy actions (which should nonetheless be
consistent with the general principles of economic policy set up by the central government).
The Constitutional arrangement has led to a profound transformation of the Spanish
economic policy in the last 25 years with a progressive transfer of economic policy domains
to territorial authorities, placing Spain among the highest decentralized economies in Europe.
A non-exhaustive list of competences in the hands of territorial authorities includes: the
provision of education and health, control of over 70 percent of the general government
budget (excluding social security), taxing capacity, labor market active policies, and product
and service market regulation. The staff rightly stresses in many instances throughout the
report, specially when referring to the fiscal framework and retail distribution problems, the
central role of territorial authorities in undertaking reforms.
This decentralized legal framework limits the ability of the central government to impose
economic regulations. Enforceability of economic policy should thereby be reliant in other
means, mainly through consensus and coordination with territorial authorities to improve
regional ownership of economic policy. In this context, elements such as transparency and
peer pressure play a central role. The government has enhanced the institutional framework
for coordination with regional authorities by creating a Summit of Presidents of
Comunidades Autónomas, that complements existing sector coordination bodies at the
ministerial level. The government will also pursue the reform of the Senate to better adapt it
to the regional reality.
FISCAL POLICY
The final 2004 budget incorporates additional payment commitments assumed by the new
government (including accounting adjustments in line with ESA-95 and the debt of the
public railways entity, RENFE) which shall bring the general government deficit to

-30.8 percent. Excluding these one-off measures, the 2004 general government position would
have been close to balance implying a broadly neutral fiscal policy.
The 2005 budget projects a surplus of 0.1 percent of GDP, which is estimated to increase up
to 0.4 percent of GDP by 2008 (see Stability Program Update1), as expenditures remain
constant in GDP terms and revenues will increase with economic growth given the
progressive nature of the tax system. In cyclically-adjusted terms, these numbers will imply a
restrictive stance in 2005 and a broadly neutral fiscal policy in 2006-2008. It is also worth
noting that, in line with the objective of boosting productivity, the government has readjusted
expenditure in favor of R&D (to be doubled in four years), education, and infrastructure.
The 2005 budget already incorporates new transparency measures such as the reconciliation
of the budget with national accounts and the inclusion of information on potential risks from
public enterprises. Transparency measures will be taken further with the new BSTL. The
fiscal ROSC, which has found Spain to fully meet or exceed transparency standards,
provides a timely input for the ongoing fiscal transparency reform.
The Staff makes many interesting suggestions to the reform of the BSTL, including in the
Selected Issues paper on fiscal discipline. Given the principle of financial autonomy
recognized in the Constitution, many of the proposals (such as the rainy day funds or
expenditure ceilings for regions) can only be undertaken by regional governments
themselves, since the central government cannot impose them. The specifics of the reform
are still under analysis; here we would stress two considerations in response to the staff’s
comments on political economy issues and the need to ensure fiscal stability: (i) the reform
will be undertaken through a process of permanent dialogue with territorial authorities, and
(ii) the law will preserve the objective of budget equilibrium and/or surplus as the central
scenario, with deficits being the exception to be justified because of cyclical considerations.
The BSTL will include features that will enable regional authorities to operate a cyclesensitive budget thereby increasing their co-responsibility to fiscal stabilization.
The Selected Issues paper on pension reform provides a useful analysis of the effects of
alternative approaches to deal with the fiscal costs of aging. The absolute magnitude of this
phenomenon needs to be reviewed in light of the new data on national accounts and
productivity, and the uncertain effects of the significant demographic changes due to
immigration (updated estimates for the population in the year 2050 have increased from 41 to
53 million people). The Economic Policy Committee is working on the new projections of
expenditure related to population aging which will be available in mid-2005. Regardless of
the new scenario, the authorities are well aware that, even in the most favourable
demographic situation, the budgetary burden of an aging population will eventually increase.
To safeguard the long-term sustainability of the public finances, the new government
structures its strategy around three main lines consistent with the staff’s view: (i) budgetary
discipline, with the social security surplus to be allocated to the Social Security Reserve Fund
(which will reach a 3 percent of GDP on 2005); (ii) sustained growth in GDP and

-4employment; and (iii) structural actions on pensions in line with the Pacto de Toledo
recommendations.
STRUCTURAL ISSUES
The strong financial position of the banking system is rooted on prudent management of
financial institutions coupled with a supportive regulatory and supervisory framework.
Financial supervision will be reinforced with a new bill on financial conglomerates that
includes a more updated distribution of competences between the supervisory bodies and the
creation of a coordinator figure (the bill will be effective next April, and adapts the 1992
regulation on financial conglomerates to the new EU Directive on this matter). On
provisioning, the Bank of Spain issued a circular in force since January 1, 2005, adopting the
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). In the new system, generic and
“statistical” provisions are merged and there is a slight decrease in the current level of
provisions, which will nonetheless remain among the highest in Europe.
Avoiding any room for complacency, the authorities closely monitor market vulnerabilities
including those associated with the expansion of real estate-related lending. Here, there is
margin for confidence as loan-to-value ratios are typically 80 percent (and far less on
average), and the authorities estimate that households could undergo interest rates increases
up to 300 basis points, before experiencing loan repayment difficulties. Even in such an
unlikely scenario, market flexibility gives households ample maneuver to anticipate changes
in financing conditions by redesigning their mortgage contracts. The authorities are focusing
on ensuring full transparency of market options and on setting up the conditions for a
diversification in the risk profile of outstanding mortgage debt through greater use of fixed or
semi-fixed rate loans.
The authorities look forward to the findings of the FSAP scheduled for 2005 which shall
provide a useful input to further strengthen the Spanish financial system.
Further improvement of the functioning of the labor market remains a central priority of the
authorities and the social partners as expressed in the joint 2004 Social Dialogue Declaration
on Competitiveness, Employment and Social Cohesion. The Declaration defines thirteen
priority areas that should focus reform efforts on the labor market including: reducing the
prevalence of fixed-term contracts, improving female employability, adapting collective
bargaining to productivity considerations, increasing the minimum wage, and enhancing
labor market active policies. The staff diagnosis on theses issues will be useful.
The 2004 Progress Report on Economic Reform of Product and Capital Markets2 reviews the
ongoing product market reforms. The authorities are developing a comprehensive
Competition Plan focused on sector liberalization measures. Among the initiatives underway,
2

-5it is worth stressing the modernization of the competition system. The reform will create by
the end of 2005 an independent and better funded National Commission of Competition that
will integrate the current instruction and resolution bodies, maintaining nonetheless the
independence of both procedures. We would again stress here the role to be played by
territorial authorities on product market reform, as pointed out by staff when referring to
retail distribution.
The new government has placed the reform of the housing market as one of its key priorities
on the political agenda (explicitly signaled with the creation of a new Housing Ministry).
Notwithstanding the risks introduced by the boom in housing prices in the last few years, it
should be highlighted that price increases have been backed by fundamentals, with supply at
historical records but not keeping up with the pace of demand (last year has marked yet
another construction record with an estimated 675,000 new homes built). Housing prices in
2004 are already showing signs of a decelerating trend and the authorities expect an orderly
stabilization of prices in the coming years with limited impact on the economy (Box 2 on the
staff paper provides a stress-test that reflects limited impact even in worse case scenarios of
absolute price declines). In order to favor this orderly adjustment, the authorities have
undertaken a package of urgent measures in 2005, focused on promoting the rental market
and increasing the supply of social housing. The government is now working on a more
comprehensive strategy that will consider fiscal measures and a reform to the law on land
use.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2004 Article IV Consultation
with Spain
On February 9 2005, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Spain.1
Background
With growth proceeding at a steady pace of 2.6 percent during 2004, the Spanish economy
has weathered the slowdown in the EU relatively well. Output growth has remained above
the euro-area average, thanks to the strength of domestic demand—buoyed by private
consumption and construction—while net exports have exercised a strong drag on
economic growth. This pattern of growth has contributed to the maintenance of an inflation
differential of about 1 percentage point vis-à-vis the euro area average. Concurrently,
household indebtedness has continued rising amidst an ongoing real estate boom, with
house prices experiencing double-digit increases for the sixth consecutive year. Despite a
further erosion in competitiveness, overall export market shares have held up reasonably
well, with, however, a continued compression of export margins. The external current
account is estimated to have widened to some 4¼ percent of GDP in the first half of 2004.
A gradual, but sustained recovery is expected, with GDP growth projected at 2.7 percent in
2005—again based on the strength of domestic demand, with a continued negative
contribution of net exports. Growth would thus continue to outstrip that expected for the
euro area, but inflation is also projected to remain comparatively higher.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of
the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to
the country's authorities.

-2-

Policy conditions have been accommodative. In particular, real short-term interest rates
have been negative for three years, spurring strong credit demand. The general
government is estimated—excluding one-time adjustments—to have recorded a slight
surplus in 2004, implying a mildly stimulatory stance. For 2005, the budget target of a
0.1 percent of GDP general government surplus implies a slightly restrictive fiscal stance.
The authorities intend to modify the fiscal framework embodied in the Budgetary Stability
Law to provide explicit scope for cyclical swings and increase observance by subnational
governments in a highly devolved system.
The banking sector has maintained a strong financial position, helped by the favorable
macroeconomic environment, the rebound of economic activity in Latin America, and
vigilant prudential oversight. Rapidly rising real estate lending has heightened credit risk,
but stress tests remain reassuring. A Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) is
scheduled for 2005.
On the structural front, earlier reforms in labor and product markets have improved the
flexibility of these markets. Some long-standing issues remain however to be addressed,
including notably pension reform, the wage negotiating framework, the land supply
process, and competition in retail distribution.

Executive Board Assessment
They commended the authorities’ skillful macroeconomic management and welcomed the
economy’s remarkably strong performance, reflected in the continued rapid rise in per
capita incomes, vigorous job creation, and comparatively strong fiscal position. Sound
policies—stemming from a well-established recognition of the benefits of fiscal discipline,
wage moderation, and growth-enhancing structural reforms—underpin this performance.
Directors endorsed the government’s announced priorities of fiscal stability, transparency,
and productivity enhancement, and welcomed the initiatives being taken in each of these
areas. They looked forward to the further definition of policies in the period ahead to deal
with both immediate and longer-term challenges and risks.
While short-term prospects remain favorable, Directors stressed that maintaining this
positive outlook will require countering key domestic risks posed by the persisting real
estate boom, rising household indebtedness, and an appreciable inflation differential with
the euro area. While Directors recognized that the rise in house prices is partly driven by a
number of fundamental factors, they cautioned that the longer the process continues, the
greater the potential for an overshooting and an adverse fallout. At the same time, the
unbalanced nature of the consumption-led growth, the prevalence of backward-looking
wage indexation clauses, and the lack of sufficient competition in sheltered sectors risk
prolonging inflation and further eroding competitiveness.
In the face of these risks, and given the presence of very accommodative monetary
conditions for Spain, Directors stressed the importance of firm fiscal restraint. They thus
welcomed the indications of a better-than-expected fiscal outcome in 2004, boosted by the
strength of tax revenues and social security contributions. Directors encouraged the
authorities to build on this result and pursue a better-than-budgeted surplus in 2005,

-3-

by proactively containing central government spending below the budget ceiling,
safeguarding the contingency fund, and fully saving the expected social security surplus.
Directors also stressed the importance that regional governments—which account for a large
share of expenditure—adhere firmly to their commitments to balanced budgets. While
acknowledging the importance of prudent fiscal policy, some Directors noted that structural
policies would be more effective in stemming inflationary pressures, given the underlying
rigidities of the economy. In this connection, Directors supported the authorities’ efforts to
shift the composition of spending in favor of research, development, and education in order
to enhance Spain’s productivity and competitiveness over the medium term.
Directors highlighted the importance of a strong budgetary framework for the maintenance of
Spain’s hard-earned fiscal stability. They stressed that the primary objective of changes to
the Budgetary Stability Law thus needed to be the promotion of greater overall fiscal
discipline, with reliance on well-defined and transparent rules covering the desirable
medium-term target, the methodology used to determine observance over the cycle, and the
fiscal relations with subnational governments.
Directors stressed the importance of fiscal discipline at lower levels of government in Spain’s
highly decentralized system. In the absence of hard enforcement mechanisms for
subnational governments, all available means to contain risks of fiscal laxity would need to
be drawn upon. Many Directors advised that the regions should consistently aim at budget
balance, avoiding a build-up in subnational debt. Directors felt that the regions could usefully
adopt budgetary instruments that have proved effective at the central government level, such
as an expenditure ceiling and a contingency fund. They also saw a role for increased
regional revenue-raising powers and the establishment of independent agencies to assess
budgetary developments and trends.
Directors noted that fiscal discipline would ultimately need to rely largely on dissuasive peer
and public pressure, whose exercise requires the highest degree of fiscal transparency.
They welcomed the positive assessment of the fiscal Report on the Observance of
Standards and Codes (ROSC) that Spain meets, or exceeds, the Fiscal Transparency
Code’s standards in many areas, as well as the authorities’ more recent steps to enhance
transparency. However, Directors called for a significant improvement in the timeliness and
publication of subnational budgetary data. Several Directors noted that such improved fiscal
transparency would need to be an integral part of any changes to the Budgetary Stability
Law.
Directors urged the authorities to assign higher priority to comprehensive pension reform,
noting the slow progress under the Pacto de Toledo process to date. They remarked that the
fiscal costs of aging, while arising comparatively later in Spain than in other EU countries,
would still be considerable. While the build-up of the pension reserve fund is thus welcome,
Directors stressed that such pre-funding could not by itself ensure the longer-run
sustainability of social security. Reforms aimed at raising the effective retirement age and
strengthening the link between contributions and benefits would also be needed. Directors
noted that, if decided promptly, reform measures could be phased in gradually, avoiding the
need for more difficult measures as the demographic shock nears.

-4-

In the labor market, Directors welcomed the appreciable progress in key employment and
other indicators, on the heels of a series of labor market reforms. Nonetheless, Spain
continues to lag significantly behind key Lisbon objectives, and Directors encouraged the
authorities to take further action to narrow this gap. The ongoing social dialogue should
clearly aim to promote the labor market flexibility required for the smooth absorption of
Spain’s large immigration flows. In this vein, Directors suggested that reducing the rigidity
and costs of standard open-ended contracts is the best way to reduce the uncommonly high
rate of fixed-term contracts. They also reiterated the need to reform the collective wage
bargaining system to assign greater attention to relative productivity developments, and
move away from indexation clauses.
In goods and services markets, Directors supported the authorities’ emphasis on increased
competition in various areas, including through a modernization of the Competition Law.
Directors expressed concern about the continued impediments to competition in retail trade
and distribution enacted by subnational authorities. Noting that such barriers have costs for
the regions themselves, they urged the authorities to continue working with subnational
governments on policies to make competition effective throughout Spain. Finally, Directors
noted the urgent need to address fundamental problems affecting the housing market, in
particular by phasing out the generous tax relief favoring home ownership, changing the
legal framework that discourages rental activity, and reforming the regulations constraining
the supply of developable land.
Directors welcomed the further strengthening of the banking system, boosted by the
favorable economic environment and the rebound of economic activity in Latin America.
They noted, however, that the continued expansion of real estate-related lending has raised
vulnerabilities, and welcomed the Bank of Spain’s continued vigilance and the planned
conduct of a Financial Sector Assessment Program. Directors also commended Spain’s
commitment to counter money laundering and the financing of terrorism.
Directors encouraged the authorities to build upon the increase in Spain’s official
development assistance in 2004, and to progress further toward the U.N. target. In noting
Spain’s support for trade liberalization, Directors urged the authorities to actively promote the
completion of the Doha round, inter alia by supporting the flexibility needed on agricultural
issues. Directors welcomed Spain’s progress in increasing energy efficiency.
