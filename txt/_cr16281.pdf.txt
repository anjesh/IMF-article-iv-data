IMF Executive Board Concludes 2016 Article IV Consultation with Guatemala

On August 22, 2016, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation1 with Guatemala, and considered and endorsed the staff appraisal
without a meeting.2
The Guatemalan economy withstood the 2015 political crisis well. A solid policy track record
together with favorable external conditions contributed to the resilience. The new administration,
who took office in January, 2016, is undertaking important efforts to tackle corruption, one of the
major challenges facing the country’s economy and society at large. The main strands of these
efforts include a broad-based reform of the tax and customs administration, more transparent
public procurement, increased accountability of Congress, a more independent Judiciary, and
stricter application of the rule of law.
Macroeconomic performance has been solid. The economy grew at 4.1 percent in 2015, slightly
above potential, despite a slowdown in public consumption and investment during the crisis.
Private consumption was lifted by lower oil prices and strong remittances. The latter also
boosted the external position, creating a comfortable reserve cushion. With inflation wellanchored, monetary policy was eased to support growth. The financial system remained stable
with no material loss of correspondent banking relationships. Fiscal revenues, however, fell well
below expectations. The shortfall was offset by even larger spending cuts, resulting in a fiscal
deficit below the budget target.
Progress on social objectives is lagging. Only one fourth of the Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs) for 2015 were met, with none met for the rural and indigenous population. Moreover,
there have been reversals in reducing extreme poverty and raising school enrollment.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.
2
The Executive Board takes decisions under its lapse-of-time procedure when the Board agrees that a proposal can
be considered without convening formal discussions.

2
The macroeconomic outlook remains benign. Growth is set to return to its trend rate of 3.8
percent in 2016 and gradually rise to 4 percent in the medium term, reflecting the positive impact
of efforts to increase transparency and efficiency of public spending. Despite a pick-up in food
price inflation, headline inflation has remained within the target range so far in 2016 and is
expected to stay on course in the medium term. The external position is set to widen to 1.7
percent of GDP by 2021, driven by gradual reversal of the oil price decline and strong domestic
demand. Fiscal deficit is projected to remain close to 1.5 percent of GDP in the medium term.
Risks, however, are tilted towards the downside due to global uncertainties and domestic policy
constraints.
Executive Board Assessment
The economy weathered the 2015 political crisis well. Despite the impact of revenue shortfalls
on public expenditure, growth remained robust in 2015, supported by low oil prices and strong
remittances. The exchange rate has been stable and inflation has remained within the central
bank’s target range. These trends are expected to continue in the medium term, with GDP
growing at potential and inflation within the target range. The current account deficit is projected
to increase only gradually. However, there are downside risks to growth from global
uncertainties and domestic policy constraints.
A higher fiscal deficit could be justified on structural and social grounds. With the output gap
closed, the current broadly neutral fiscal stance is reasonable. However, a fiscal relaxation to
bring the overall deficit to around 2 percent of GDP may be justified to maintain capital and
social spending and to implement the anti-corruption reform agenda. However, this should be a
temporary increase in the deficit while efforts to raise the revenue-GDP ratio are put in place.
Monetary policy should be attuned to signs of an increase in inflation. Core inflation remains
below the target range, inflation expectations well-anchored, and inflation is forecasted to remain
within the target range. However, the central bank should stand ready to increase the policy rate
promptly if inflationary pressures intensify.
Structural objectives should guide fiscal policy over the medium-term. A gradual increase in
fiscal revenues to at least 15 percent of GDP would be essential to meet critical social, security
and infrastructure needs and to support long-term growth. This will require both improvements
in tax administration and a revamp of the tax policy framework, including through an increase in
tax rates. Tax reform should be presented in the context of a more comprehensive reform
strategy to help secure public support. Measures to improve fiscal transparency and efficiency on
the expenditure side would help raise government credibility.
The central bank should transition to a full-fledged inflation targeting. Additional measures to
strengthen the monetary transmission, including continuing efforts to increase exchange rate
flexibility, discourage dollarization, cover past and current operational losses of the Central Bank

3
in the short term and recapitalize the Central Bank in the longer term, and develop capital
markets would help with that transition.
Guatemala's external position is moderately stronger than the level consistent with medium term
fundamentals and desirable policy settings. A lower-than-desirable fiscal deficit accounts for
most of the identified policy gap. Reducing crime and corruption, investing in education and
infrastructure, strengthening legal protection, and deepening the financial system would help
mitigate the competitiveness gap.
Efforts to fortify the financial system should continue. The financial system appears sound,
though moderately high credit dollarization, fast growing foreign bank liabilities, and exposure
to sovereign debt represent vulnerabilities. The system has not been materially affected by the
loss of correspondent banking relationships. However, this should not slow efforts to strengthen
risk-based Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism supervision and bring
the framework into line with the Financial Action Task Force standards, especially as it would
complement efforts to combat crime and corruption. Continued implementation of the 2014
Financial Sector Assessment Program update and regional cluster surveillance report
recommendations, including strengthening capital and liquidity buffers as well as enhancing
consolidated supervision of financial conglomerates, will help strengthen financial system’s
resilience.
Structural reforms should support higher and more inclusive growth. Increasing the size and
efficiency of social assistance programs as well as raising public expenditures on education,
infrastructure, and security will be important to continue building human and physical capital.
Improved childcare and support to indigenous women could help raise female labor force
participation. Continued progress on regional and international integration, stronger competition
policies, and measures to support financial deepening and inclusion, will also help stimulate
long-term inclusive growth. Articulating an overarching long-term growth and social strategy
would help garner public support for the reforms.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
August 2, 2016

KEY ISSUES
Context. Despite a political crisis, linked to the arrest of the former President and other
officials on corruption charges, Guatemala’s economy has coped well. Growth and the
external position have been boosted by low oil prices and strong remittances, while the
fiscal deficit had declined. However, progress on social objectives is lagging. There are
downside risks from global uncertainties and domestic policy constraints.
Near-term policies are effectively balancing growth and inflation considerations.
However, the authorities should remain vigilant if inflation pressures intensify. Raising
revenue is the main priority, but given the low public debt and fiscal deficit, a temporary
fiscal relaxation could be justified to address pressing structural and social needs.
The authorities are undertaking important efforts to tackle corruption. The main
strands of these efforts include a broad-based reform of the tax and customs
administration, more transparent public procurement, increased accountability of
Congress, a more independent judiciary, and stricter application of the rule of law.
Fiscal policies should focus on supply side and social objectives. Accommodating
higher social, security and infrastructure spending will necessitate an increase in
revenues from both improved tax administration and tax policy changes. Greater fiscal
transparency and spending efficiency will be important to increase government
credibility.
Fortification and deepening of the financial system should continue. The transition
to a full-fledged inflation targeting should be completed and should support a reduction
in financial dollarization. The authorities should further pursue efforts to improve their
AML/CFT supervision, strengthen the bank resolution framework, fortify capital buffers,
and enhance the consolidated supervision of financial conglomerates. Strengthening the
legal and regulatory frameworks will help provide a climate for further financial
deepening and inclusion.
Structural reforms are vital to raise potential growth and lessen poverty and
inequality. Higher and more efficient public spending, greater regional and global
integration, stronger competition policies, rural development and higher female labor
force participation could help support higher inclusive growth.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
1.
The 2015 political crisis has brought an anti-corruption agenda to the fore. Corruption
is deeply-rooted in Guatemala. The global competitiveness report (2015–16) lists corruption as one
of the most problematic factors for doing business in Guatemala. During 2015, the International
Commission against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG) helped unveil cases of tax graft, money
laundering, and illegal funding, which led to the arrest of top officials in the Tax and Customs
Authority (SAT) and the Social Security Institute, and to the indictment of former President Perez
Molina and Vice President Baldetti. Amid broad national discontent, traditional political parties lost
support in favor of President Morales, who took office in January 2016 on a platform of no-tolerance
against corruption (Box 1).

Box 1. Key Elements of the Anti-Corruption Strategy
A central priority in the fight against corruption is the tax administration (SAT). Unveiled cases of tax
graft in 2015 have sharply eroded the credibility of an already ailing SAT, weakened tax compliance, and led
to collection losses. The new government has adopted emergency actions to regain control over customs
and institute a new SAT law recently approved by Congress aimed at strengthening governance and
removing bank secrecy constraints to tax enforcement starting in 2017. A strategic plan for tax and customs
administration is being developed, with Fund assistance.
In late 2015, Congress approved changes to strengthen the governance and transparency of
government’s procurement practices. Key innovations are the creation of an e-outlet (“Guatecompras”) to
provide transparent information on procurement transactions and the introduction of reverse auctions to
enhance competition among suppliers. The new bill on procurement forbids government contracts with
state officials and sponsors of political parties. It also improves the technical capacity of government’s
awarding committees, and sets up penalties for collusion or noncompetitive practices in supplying the
government. The authorities are also developing a strategy to increase fiscal transparency, with Fund
assistance.
The anti-corruption effort extends to Congress, the Judiciary, and political parties. New organic laws
were passed to improve the accountability of Congress and enhance the independence of the Judiciary in
2016. The bills reduce conflict of interest by discouraging deputies from switching political parties and
constrain their hiring of excessive staff. The bills also reduce discretion in the removal of the general
attorney; grant him/her with broader powers to designate prosecutors and strengthen criminal investigation.
More recently, Congress passed bills to increase the transparency of funding of political parties, set
guidelines to develop the judicial service, and enhance recruitment and promotion of civil servants in
Congress based on merit. A civil service initiative for the Executive is also under way.
The government plans to reform the Constitution to further strengthen the Judiciary. Congress will
soon consider reforms to broaden access to justice, strengthen the role and protection of judges, and
reduce abuses of immunity granted to government officials. In the meantime, a stricter application of the
rule of law has led to multiple legal proceedings against the illicit use of government funds, money
laundering, and bribery, which have led to the recovery of past-due taxes and other assets.

3.
Inflation rose in 2016 but remains close to the center of the target range. Inflation was
below the 4±1 percent target range during most of 2015 driven by lower transportation and utility
tariffs (Figure 1). It returned to the target range in 2015, and exceeded the center of the range in
early 2016, driven by higher food prices as well as dissipation of last year’s declines in transportation
and utility tariffs. High food inflation reflected both higher demand associated with strong
remittances that eased constraints on the poor as well as weather-related supply shocks (Box 2). Core
inflation slowed further in early 2016, likely due to the second-round effects from lower oil prices
and appreciation of the real effective exchange rate (REER). Inflation expectations remained wellanchored and are now close to the center of the target range.

Box 2. Food Price Inflation
Guatemala-specific factors are behind consistently high food price inflation (AN). While rising global
prices of wheat and corn —the main food imports of Guatemala— contributed to high food inflation in
2010-11, this has not been the case since 2013. Differences in food inflation across Central American
countries suggest that country-specific factors have likely been at play.
Strong remittances have been an important driver of the recent increase. A few products have driven
the pickup in food inflation—especially, vegetables and meat. These products tend to be added to the basic
diet of poor households as incomes rise. The prices of some vegetable products rose strongly in late 2015
due to the weather-related shocks. However, demand factors, including strong remittances growth, have
also likely played a role, not least because remittances constitute an important income source for mid- and
low-income families in rural areas.

Other structural factors may also be at fault. Higher transportation and intermediation costs,
compared to regional peers—possibly due to poor transport infrastructure, particularly in rural areas, or
competition issues—could prevent rapid adjustment in the face of demand or supply shocks and contribute
to persistently high food inflation. Non-tariff barriers, such as sanitary and phyto-sanitary measures, could
also be limiting regional trade of food products.
Supply side policies could help. Increased investments in transport infrastructure, stronger competition
policies, including the adoption of the new Competition Law and the establishment of the competition
agency, further advances in regional trade integration, and policies to support agricultural production,
including through programs to improve access to irrigation, financing, and technical assistance, could help
reduce pressures from food prices.

The balance of payments strengthened significantly in 2015. The current account deficit
shrank by 1¾ percent of GDP while the REER appreciated by 10 percent on the back of low oil prices
and robust remittances. Net international reserves (NIR) stood at US$7 billion or 4.2 months of
imports at end-2015, above the alternative IMF reserve adequacy metrics. The net debtor
international investment position (20 percent of GDP) is low, compared to peers (Annex I).
5.
The external position is moderately stronger than implied by fundamentals and
desirable policy settings (Annex I). Staff’s preferred EBA-lite current account (CA) methodology
suggests a CA gap of about 2 percent of GDP, implying a moderate (7 percent) REER undervaluation.
Lower-than-desirable fiscal deficit accounts for most of the identified policy gap. Competitiveness
weaknesses appear linked to crime and corruption, low fiscal spending on education and
infrastructure, weak legal system, and relatively shallow financial system.

With inflation contained, monetary
policy has been loosened to support growth.
The central bank cut the policy rate three times in
2015 by a cumulative 100 basis points (to 3
percent). The nominal exchange rate has remained
broadly stable vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar. In 2016 the
exchange rate fluctuation margin under the central
bank’s intervention rule was widened slightly—
from 0.7 to 0.75 percent of the five-day moving
average—as part of a gradual process to allow for
more exchange rate flexibility.

8.
The financial system appears sound, although vulnerabilities remain. Banks meet Basel I
capital requirements, have sufficient liquidity, and NPL ratios are low (Figure 3). However, capital
levels are low by regional standards and insufficient to cover market and operational risks under
Basel II. Credit expanded rapidly in 2015, mostly in foreign-currency. Credit growth has subsequently
slowed as large electricity projects, financed by loans in foreign currency, have been completed and
there are no indications of a buildup in credit risks (Table 3). Nonetheless, credit dollarization stood
at a moderately high 36 percent of total loans at end-May2016 (up from 27 percent at end-2010).
Reliance on foreign funding has continued rising with bank foreign liabilities currently at a decade
high (15 percent of total bank assets) and among the highest in the region. Government bond
holdings are relatively large (11 percent of bank assets) and about half of the bonds are in the
available-for-sale portfolio used to manage liquidity. Private sector balance sheets appear healthy
with limited accumulation of debt in the last decade, and foreign currency loans are concentrated in
the corporate sector (AN).

Progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) has been slow.
Only one fourth of the MDGs targets for 2015 were met, with none met for the rural and indigenous
population (Figure 3). Moreover, there have been reversals in reducing extreme poverty and raising
school enrollment. Low fiscal revenues and the need for a comprehensive social strategy remain key
hurdles to achieving the new sustainable development goals.

MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND RISKS
10.
The macroeconomic outlook remains solid. Growth is set to return to its trend rate of 3¾
percent in 2016 as weaker public expenditures and lingering effects of the REER appreciation offset
the positive impact of lower oil prices and monetary stimulus from 2015 (AN) . Potential growth is
expected to rise gradually to 4 percent in the medium term reflecting the positive impact of efforts
to increase transparency and efficiency of public spending on investment climate and productivity.
Inflation is projected to remain within the target range. The external current account deficit is set to
widen to 1¾ percent of GDP by 2021, driven by gradual reversal of the oil price decline and strong
domestic demand, while remaining more than fully financed by FDI. Reserves are expected to remain
stable in light of the authorities’ commitment to maintain exchange rate flexibility with reserves-toimport cover declining somewhat over time. Staff welcomed the move towards more flexibility and
stressed the need to maintain reserve adequacy.

The fiscal deficit is expected to remain at 1½ percent of GDP in 2016 and hover around
this level in the medium term. The 2016 budget envisions a deficit of 1½ percent of GDP—lower
than the historical average of 2 percent of GDP. Staff expects the actual deficit outcome to be close
to the budget. However, there is a possibility of a somewhat higher deficit in 2016 in the event of
continued revenue shortfalls.
12.
Near-term risks are on the downside, owing to global uncertainties and domestic
policy constraints (Annex II):


External risks. Deeper-than-expected slowdown in advanced and emerging markets,
including due to increased protectionism, could reduce growth. Extreme bouts of financial
volatility could inflict damage, with a substantial depreciation vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar
increasing credit risks from un-hedged borrowers (Figure 5, AN). Conversely, continued REER
appreciation in line with the U.S. dollar could negatively affect competitiveness. There are
also downside risks from potential reductions in provision of financial services by global
banks, including the withdrawal of correspondent banking services.



Domestic risks. Failure to credibly address the crisis at the SAT could endanger efforts to
increase revenue and jeopardize much needed social and investment spending. Anti-money
laundering efforts that implicate staff or owners of domestic banks could lead to transitory
financial pressures (although recent arrests of delinquent bank managers have not had
broader effects on financial stability). A further deterioration in the security situation would
jeopardize growth.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
13.
There was a shared view that the policy agenda should focus on achieving higher longterm inclusive growth while preserving macroeconomic stability. In the short term, the
authorities have to balance prudent macro-economic management with the need to start addressing
pressing structural and social needs. In the longer-term, strengthening fiscal and monetary policy

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

GUATEMALA

frameworks, fortifying the financial system, and broadening social opportunities will help facilitate
higher and more inclusive growth.

A. Near-Term Policy Mix
14.
Pressing structural and social needs could justify a temporarily higher deficit. The
primary balance is expected to remain near zero in 2016 with the output gap closed. Hence, from a
cyclical perspective there is no need for fiscal support. While the first-best option is to quickly
mobilize revenue to cover the originally planned budget spending in 2016, a temporary relaxation of
the overall deficit (to its historical average of 2 percent of GDP) could be justified to prevent further
cuts in social and capital spending in the event of revenue shortfalls. The acute problem of extreme
poverty and malnutrition as well as the dire infrastructure and security needs could warrant
maintaining a deficit at 2 percent of GDP, or even modestly higher, over the medium term to allow
the time needed for revenue mobilization. This would not jeopardize fiscal sustainability (Annex III)
and be consistent with current implementation capacity. The authorities agreed with staff view and
the Minister of Finance saw room for a temporary deficit higher than 2 percent of GDP.
15.
Reform of tax and customs administration is a key priority, both to raise revenue and
reduce corruption. In this regard, measures to address governance, management and operational
difficulties in line with IMF technical assistance recommendations are crucial. These include: (i)
strengthening management and broadening the implementation of pro-integrity measures
internally; (ii) strengthening customs by ensuring more effective control of goods, more accurate
valuation of imports, and stricter control of special trade regimes; (iii) more effective control of large
and medium-size taxpayers’ compliance; (iv) taking measures to improve VAT administration,
including the enforcement of issuance of VAT invoices; (v) increasing the effectivity of audits; and (vi)
improving taxpayer services, including by broadening e-services. There is a need for a short- and
medium-term reform strategy encompassing these measures, with clear priorities, and timetables.
The authorities agreed on the main steps and have started implementing some of them but
emphasized that these measures will take time to bear fruit.
16.
The monetary policy stance is broadly appropriate but the central bank should be
ready to tighten if inflationary pressures intensify. The financial conditions index (FCI) suggests
that lower real lending rates, strong credit growth, and higher housing prices contributed to a small
loosening of financial conditions in 2015 despite an
Monetary and Financial Conditions Index (2007-15)
(Percentage points of y/y real GDP growth, quarterly)
appreciation of the REER (AN). The estimates of the
neutral policy rate point to an accommodative
monetary stance (although there is significant
uncertainty surrounding these estimates). However,
core inflation has been below the target range since
2013, and inflation expectations are firmly within the
target range. Despite this, there are upside risks to
inflation due to the possible food price pressures,

delayed effects of the past monetary easing (AN). As such, the central bank should be ready to raise

commitment to its inflation goals and emphasized the hard-earned credibility of the monetary policy
in Guatemala.

17.
Sound financial sector policies have contributed to financial stability. So far, Guatemala
has not been materially affected by a loss of correspondent banking relationships (CBRs) but other
risks related to financial integrity have increased supervisor’s vigilance and contingency planning
(Box 3). As a result, banks are facing increasing pressure to comply with AML/CFT regulations. Staff
commended the authorities for the recently taken steps to strengthen control of customer
identification, perform national risk assessments, increase the frequency of on-site inspections, and
increase protection of supervisors. Staff also welcomed the ongoing initiatives to develop a

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

GUATEMALA

comprehensive macro-prudential program and strengthen the resolution framework through the
introduction of an “open bank” intervention. Staff encouraged the authorities to continue
implementing risk-based AML/CFT supervision, and bring the framework in line with the 2012 FATF
standards.
Box 3. Financial Integrity in Guatemala
The loss of CBRs has been limited but the risks from money laundering activities are real. So far, only
four correspondent banks have canceled accounts with four small Guatemalan banks. The small scale of
business in Guatemala, high operational and compliance costs, the risk of enforcement actions, and the
change in the business model of foreign banks, are the likely reasons for the loss. Nonetheless, three of the
affected local banks have foreign credit lines with other correspondent banks. Moreover, the overall value of
the foreign credit lines has continued rising in 2015 and the amount drawn stands at $4.9 bn (22 percent of
credit to the private sector). The number of correspondent banks has also increased. However, there are
other risks. Several bank managers and small individual customers are under money laundering
investigations though the banks involved have remained well-capitalized and liquid.
The supervisor has stepped up vigilance and contingency planning. Tougher AML/CFT laws aimed at
strengthening controls on activities such as remittances transfers, leasing, and factoring are under
consideration. The supervisor is improving enforcement of the policy of knowing the final beneficiaries of
bank operations. Harsher penalties for non-compliance with the reporting of suspicious transactions are
under way. Guatemala’s Financial Intelligence Unit (IVE) has undertaken a national risk assessment and has
increased the number of on-site inspections, which helped uncover several money laundering schemes and
enhance customer due diligence. The authorities have also developed a proposal for an “open bank”
intervention, which could facilitate the strengthening of ailing systemic institutions by temporarily placing
them under public sector management.

This debt ratio is below the level of other Central
American countries and countries with similar credit
ratings. A permanent fiscal relaxation of ½ percentage

percent of GDP. The debt path is resilient to macro
shocks.

19.
Fiscal policy should be reoriented towards supply side and social objectives. Raising
fiscal revenues to at least 15 percent of GDP would be essential in the longer run to accommodate
higher social and infrastructure spending and to support efforts to durably reduce crime and
corruption.1 For example, eradicating extreme poverty would cost the budget around 1 percent of
GDP per year while lifting all of the poor out of poverty would cost upwards of 7 percent of GDP per
year (AN). Achieving the SDG objective of halving poverty would require at least 5 percent of GDP in
fiscal spending. A revenue level of around 15 percent of GDP is well within reach with Guatemala’s
tax capacity—the maximum level of tax revenue that a country can achieve given its current
fundamentals—esimated at 20 percent of GDP.2 The authorities concurred that revenues would have
to rise to at least 15 to 17 percent of GDP for the government to be able to fulfill its basic public
functions.
Box 4. Poverty, Inequality, and Fiscal Redistribution
Mobilizing revenue through PIT could prove less distortive and more equitable than through VAT.
Model simulations indicate (AN) that raising one percent of GDP in additional revenue through VAT would
depress GDP by almost 2 percentage points over 5 years, compared to less than 1 percentage point decline
with similar revenue effort through PIT. VAT is also regressive, thus, poverty and inequality increase more.
The premise that the VAT is neutral for investment may not apply to Guatemala for two reasons:


Large informal economy, which escapes VAT taxation. VAT penalizes consumption of goods
produced in the formal sector, reduces demand for these goods and lowers their prices, thereby,
reducing marginal returns to formal sector firms. VAT becomes distortive because the relative prices
shift in favor of a less productive informal sector, which invests little.

1

Literature finds that the optimal size of the government, in particular, with respect to human development is at least
15 percent of GDP (AN).

Box 4. Poverty, Inequality, and Fiscal Redistribution (Concluded)
Low PIT versus medium VAT rates. PIT rates of 5 and 7 percent are among the lowest in the world
and raising them from this level would reduce GDP only slightly, compared to raising the VAT rate,
which is 12 percent―just below the regional average.1

Both government transfers and public investment will need to rise to spur growth and reduce poverty
and inequality. Expanding existing cash transfer programs could help advance towards social goals but
would be less conducive of growth than higher infrastructure spending. Proportionally expanding existing
cash transfer programs with one percent of GDP revenue generated through PIT could reduce extreme
poverty by 20 percent and inequality by 2½ percentage points. However, GDP would fall by about 1¾
percentage points since resources are shifted away from investment by the productive sector towards
consumption by the poor. In contrast, investing additional resources in infrastructure would raise the stock
of public capital and improve private sector productivity boosting GDP by about ½ percent. The impact on
extreme poverty and inequality, however, is smaller than with cash transfers. Growth and social objectives
are not necessarily incompatible as higher growth would improve living conditions and the productivity of
the poor, thereby, contributing to faster economic growth.

1/ An empirical study by Acosta-Ormaechea and Yoo (2012) also finds that in low income countries PIT does not significantly
affect growth, likely due to the low level of PIT collection in such countries (1.5 percent of GDP on average). This result is relevant
for Guatemala where PIT collection is only 0.4 percent of GDP.

20.

A multifaceted approach would be needed to achieve ambitious revenue targets:



Further measures are needed to strengthen the SAT. These should be focused on
improving control and minimizing tax evasion, including (i) strengthening the SAT’s legal
framework; (ii) encouraging staff responsibility by strengthening the performance evaluation
system and actively and consistently addressing integrity issues; and (iii) broadening and
improving the quality of the SAT’s digital services.

though in evaluating the macroeconomic and
distributional consequences of the various tax options (Box 4).



Tax reform should be set against a more comprehensive government reform strategy.
Given the fragmented political environment and recent multiple corruption scandals, the
fiscal strategy should clearly articulate the government’s broader macroeconomic and social
objectives and use these to motivate the tax and spending reforms that will be needed to
achieve those objectives. Doing so would help garner public support for reform.



The high level of revenue earmarking (currently 40 percent) should be reduced to
strengthen the efficiency of the budget. The authorities indicated that some of the
earmarking is prescribed by the constitution and will be difficult to change.

21.
Improving fiscal transparency and efficiency would help increase government
credibility. The mission encouraged the authorities to implement the IMF’s recent technical
assistance advice on fiscal transparency. In particular, the efforts should focus on (i) improving fiscal
accounting, consolidation, and reporting with adequate elaboration of fiscal risk assessments; (ii)
protecting tax administration from political interference; (iii) improving control and audit of fiscal
spending, including strengthening of units in charge of planning government purchases and internal
auditing; and (iv) regulating and making government’s direct purchases more transparent. The
authorities pointed out that they are already implementing some of the recommendations, including
measures aimed at improving transparency in the procurement of goods and services. Staff
recommended supplementing transparency efforts with measures to raise spending efficiency—in
particular, in education (Figure 2) – by continued strengthening of the implementation of program
budgeting.

Strengthening Monetary and Financial Frameworks
22.
There was an agreement on the need to continue strengthening the institutional
framework for inflation targeting. Recent improvements have been made in the monetary
transmission to credit and repo interest rates. Efforts should now focus on (i) continuing raising
exchange rate flexibility to credibly convey the primacy of the inflation objective to the public3 (ii)
reinforcing recent measures, if needed, to discourage credit dollarization, (iii) developing private debt
and securities market, (iv) refining the framework for monetary operations, including management of
short-term and structural liquidity, and (v) covering accumulated operational losses of the central
bank that are eroding its capital base and impeding the conduct of the monetary policy while
developing a more permanent solution to the legacy of past quasi-fiscal operations, including
recapitalization of the Central Bank.4
23.
The financial system appears relatively resilient though continued vigilance is
warranted. The discussion focused on the sources of financial vulnerabilities, including moderately
high degree of credit dollarization, a relatively large exposure to public debt, fast growing bank
foreign liabilities and possible FX maturity mismatches. A top-down stress test by the staff suggests
that the system could withstand sizable shocks (AN). Notwithstanding the overall long foreign
currency position of the banking system, a large exchange rate depreciation may affect asset quality
through un-hedged borrowers. It appears that the banking sector could withstand a historically
sizeable 20 percent depreciation shock, but there could be unknown non-linear effects on credit
quality. Banks balance sheets are robust to a 2 percent increase in interest rates or a severe growth
shock of 4 percentage points. Nevertheless, a combined shock in a severe adverse macroeconomic
scenario would push the aggregate capital ratio below the regulatory minimum, requiring
recapitalization of the banks.5 Rollover risks associated with foreign funding remain manageable but
the fast growth in bank foreign liabilities is an area that warrants close monitoring. Moreover,
maturity mismatches between FX assets and liabilities could represent risks though data constraints
prevent accurate assessment of these risks. Domestic and international interbank contagion effects
from credit and funding shocks appear limited with relatively small bilateral bank exposures (AN).

3

Adhering to the current intervention rule designed to mitigate excessive FX volatility while not targeting a specific
level of the exchange rate is also important to contain inflation and output volatility (AN).
4

The Central Bank keeps debt on its balance sheet, which was a result of the quasi-fiscal operations performed in the
80’s and 90’s. Every week the Central Bank sterilizes the repayment of a large amount of securities reaching maturity,
which hinders liquidity management. The organic law of the Central Bank dictates that the government covers annual
losses. However, Congress failed to approve the government transfer for this purpose for the past few years.
5

The combined shock scenario was generated by a general equilibrium model (AN). The initial shock comprised a 20
percent XR depreciation and an increase in credit risk from unhedged borrowers associated with a risk premium
increase of 200 basis points. The assumptions on growth (a decline by 4 percentage points) and interest rates (an
increase of 200 basis points) were then generated by the model.

24.
There was a joint view that the current period of stability should be used to fortify the
financial system. Efforts to differentiate risk weights based on currency denomination and to
gradually eliminate exemptions from this requirement for mortgage loans and loans to the electricity
sector may help reduce credit dollarization. However, staff noted that further macro-prudential
measures should be prepared in case the degree of dollarization persists and credit quality
deteriorates. Staff welcomed the authorities’ plan to introduce higher capital requirements for
market risk, which could help mitigate the risk from government debt exposure. The authorities
expressed reservations against the introduction of differential reserve requirements for FX deposits,
given concerns about deposit migration to offshore banking. Instead, they are considering the
introduction of a liquidity coverage ratio differentiated by currency, which staff supported. Staff also
pointed out the need to further strengthen capital buffers through a stricter definition of related
parties to mitigate risks of overestimating capital and adopting capital ratios consistent with Basel III
(including a capital surcharge for large systemic institutions). Such reforms are planned for the
coming years.
25.
Progress on implementing the 2014 FSAP update recommendations is encouraging. The
authorities have taken steps to strengthen the regulatory and supervisory frameworks, set up
dedicated committees on macro-prudential issues and crisis management, and develop a safety net
and a resolution framework for financial cooperatives and microfinancial institutions. Further efforts
are needed to improve consolidated supervision of financial conglomerates, to adjust the legal
framework in line with international standards, appoint national lead supervisors, and create a
regional council for financial stability (see the IMF Cluster Surveillance Report on Financial
Integration in CAPDR). Stepping up the ring-fencing of on-shore banks with respect to the
operations of off-shore banks will also be important.

There is a need to better articulate a long-term strategy for raising growth and making
it more inclusive. Potential growth in Guatemala is among the lowest in the region, due to both low

productivity and low human and physical capital while

growth and social objectives when evaluating
alternative spending instruments (Box 4). Increased access to education, investment in
infrastructure and information technology could also help raise LFP, including that of women
(AN). Improving provision of childcare and expanding conditional cash transfers targeting
education of indigenous girls could help narrow the gender gap in the labor market with
time.



Improving the efficiency and targeting of social assistance programs. The recent initiatives to
reform a food support program, improve control of beneficiaries of social support, and
strengthen coordination among various ministries providing social assistance are positive
steps forward.



Facilitating regional and international integration through (i) further improvements in
infrastructure, including further development of regional highways, upgrading ports and
airports; (ii) harmonizing information technology and customs transit procedures to reduce
cost; (iii) making trade rules and taxes more consistent across the region; and (iv) integrating
further the services and factors markets. Plans to implement a customs union with Honduras
and El Salvador is an important milestone in this process.



Strengthening competition policies, including through the adoption of the pending
competition law.



Promoting rural development through programs to improve access to irrigation, financing,
and technical assistance in the agricultural sector (Box 2).

Efforts toward financial deepening will help support long-run growth. Guatemala’s
financial development exceeds the level implied by its macroeconomic fundamentals (Figure 8) but
there are no indications of a significant risk buildup (Table 3). However, financial development, in
particular, market development is low by regional standards and has a long way to go to allow
reaping maximum growth benefits. Market development could be helped by strengthening the legal
and institutional foundations for market finance. This should include the adoption of the securities
market law, continued progress on issuing securities in electronic rather than physical form
(dematerialization), standardization of government securities as well as the adoption of the public
debt law, which could facilitate concentration of government debt into a smaller number of large
volume issues.6 Strengthening property and ownership rights, improving the efficiency of the legal
system, reducing corruption, and improving corporate governance will also facilitate financial
deepening.

6

About half of all securities accepted as collateral by the central bank are kept as physical securities and are not
settled through a book–entry system. Dematerialization would require establishing an efficient central depository for
all securities; putting a book–entry system in place; and providing investors with automatic cash flow payments on
dematerialized securities.

Recent progress in financial inclusion is encouraging, but continued follow-through on
the government initiatives is needed. Guatemala lags other emerging markets on financial
inclusion (Box 5). Strengthening the regulatory environment and reducing entry costs are key
priorities (AN). Recent regulatory initiatives go in this direction, including the adoption of the
microfinance law and the regulation of mobile financial services as well as ongoing efforts to develop
a national financial inclusion strategy and promote financial education. Introduction of simplified
bank accounts for low-income customers, currently under consideration, as well as other measures
aimed at reducing entry costs would not only raise financial inclusion but also help stimulate growth
and reduce inequality. In the longer run, once entry barriers are reduced, there is scope to examine
financial institutions’ lending practices and credit concentration limits, facilitate the development of
credit bureaus and promote greater bank competition. These measures, aimed at lowering
information costs and collateral requirements, could also boost growth.

Box 5. Financial Inclusion, Growth, and Inequality
Guatemala has a wide network of access points but financial services remain underutilized and regulation is
lagging (AN). With 37 branches and 36 ATMs per 100,000 adults, outpacing LAC averages of 24 branches and 25
ATMs, Guatemala is among the regional champions. A wide network of banking correspondents also facilitates
access. However, the country does not score well on regulation This reflects the absence of a formal
comprehensive financial inclusion strategy, under-developed credit reporting systems, weak regulation of
electronic payments and others (AN). The use of financial services is also low. Only 41 percent of adults (47 percent
in LAC) and 60 percent of SMEs (90 percent in LAC) have a bank account. Progress on inclusion is constrained by
Guatemala’s fundamentals: income level, education level, in particular, among women, shadow economy size, and
the rule of law.
Reducing entry costs could help lower inequality and raise growth. Among LAC peers, Guatemalan companies
face moderate collateral requirements and intermediation costs. In contrast, they have low access to credit. Model
simulations suggest (AN) that the reduction in either entry, borrowing, or intermediation costs will generate an
improvement in growth. 1 However, easing the borrowing and intermediation constraints could also increase
inequality—with already moderate levels of collateral and borrowing costs, the benefits would accrue mostly to
productive and wealthy entrepreneurs. In contrast, reduction in the entry costs, which would allow higher access
for productive firms at the bottom of the distribution, will both raise growth and reduce inequality. Given high
degree of inequality in Guatemala, efforts should focus on reducing the entry costs in the first place.

Intermediation Costs

The model considers 3 types of financial market constraints. Entry (participation) costs reflect high documentation requirements
by banks for opening, maintaining, and closing accounts and other barriers, including red tape and the need for informal
guarantors as connections to access finance. Borrowing constraints are determined by collateral requirements. Intermediation
(monitoring) costs result from information asymmetries and limited bank competition.

STAFF APPRAISAL
29.
The economy weathered the 2015 political crisis well. Despite the impact of revenue
shortfalls on public expenditure, growth remained robust in 2015, supported by low oil prices and
strong remittances. The exchange rate has been stable and inflation has remained within the central
bank’s target range. These trends are expected to continue in the medium term, with GDP growing
at potential and inflation within the target range. The current account deficit is projected to increase
only gradually. However, there are downside risks to growth from global uncertainties and domestic
policy constraints.
30.
A higher fiscal deficit could be justified on structural and social grounds. With the
output gap closed, the current broadly neutral fiscal stance is reasonable. However, a fiscal relaxation
to bring the overall deficit to around 2 percent of GDP may be justified to maintain capital and social
spending and to implement the anti-corruption reform agenda. However, this should be a temporary
increase in the deficit while efforts to raise the revenue-GDP ratio are put in place.
31.
Monetary policy should be attuned to signs of an increase in inflation. Core inflation
remains below the target range, inflation expectations well-anchored, and inflation is forecasted to
remain within the target range. However, the central bank should stand ready to increase the policy
rate promptly if inflationary pressures intensify.
32.
Structural objectives should guide fiscal policy over the medium-term. A gradual
increase in fiscal revenues to at least 15 percent of GDP would be essential to meet critical social,
security and infrastructure needs and to support long-term growth. This will require both
improvements in tax administration and a revamp of the tax policy framework, including through an
increase in tax rates. Tax reform should be presented in the context of a more comprehensive reform
strategy to help secure public support. Measures to improve fiscal transparency and efficiency on the
expenditure side would help raise government credibility.
33.
The central bank should transition to a full-fledged inflation targeting. Additional
measures to strengthen the monetary transmission, including continuing efforts to increase
exchange rate flexibility, discourage dollarization, cover past and current operational losses of the
Central Bank in the short term and recapitalize the Central Bank in the longer term, and develop
capital markets would help with that transition.
34.
Guatemala's external position is moderately stronger than the level consistent with
medium term fundamentals and desirable policy settings. A lower-than-desirable fiscal deficit
accounts for most of the identified policy gap. Reducing crime and corruption, investing in education
and infrastructure, strengthening legal protection, and deepening the financial system would help
mitigate the competitiveness gap.
35.
Efforts to fortify the financial system should continue. The financial system appears
sound, though moderately high credit dollarization, fast growing foreign bank liabilities, and
exposure to sovereign debt represent vulnerabilities. The system has not been materially affected by

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

29

the loss of correspondent banking relationships. However, this should not slow efforts to strengthen
risk-based AML/CFT supervision and bring the framework into line with the FATF standards,
especially as it would complement efforts to combat crime and corruption. Continued
implementation of the 2014 FSAP update and regional cluster surveillance report recommendations,
including strengthening capital and liquidity buffers as well as enhancing consolidated supervision of
financial conglomerates, will help strengthen financial system’s resilience.
36.
Structural reforms should support higher and more inclusive growth. Increasing the size
and efficiency of social assistance programs as well as raising public expenditures on education,
infrastructure, and security will be important to continue building human and physical capital.
Improved childcare and support to indigenous women could help raise female labor force
participation. Continued progress on regional and international integration, stronger competition
policies, and measures to support financial deepening and inclusion, will also help stimulate longterm inclusive growth. Articulating an overarching long-term growth and social strategy would help
garner public support for the reforms.
37.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12month cycle.

GUATEMALA

Annex I. External Sector Assessment
Staff’s preferred EBA-lite current account (CA) methodology suggests a CA gap of about 2 percent of
GDP, implying moderate undervaluation of the real effective exchange rate (REER) of 7 percent. Lowerthan-desirable fiscal deficit accounts for most of the identified policy gap. Based on this, staff concludes
that Guatemala’s external position is moderately stronger than implied by fundamentals and desirable
policy settings. However, while there are no indications of serious price competitiveness problems,
there are signs of structural competitiveness weaknesses that need to be addressed. Reducing crime
and corruption, investing in education and infrastructure, strengthening legal protection, and
deepening the financial system would help improve competitiveness and facilitate economy’s
adjustment to large external shocks.
Since 2000, the CPI-based REER has appreciated by 66 percent while the trade balance has
improved. The NEER remained relatively stable over the same period suggesting that the
substantial real effective exchange rate appreciation

The positive terms of trade shock and strong remittances contributed to a significant
improvement in the CA position and a notable appreciation of the REER in 2015. Between 2014
and 2015 the CA deficit shrank by 1.8 percentage points of GDP driven by strong remittances and

low international oil prices while the REER appreciated by 10 percentage points resulting in a
significant positive deviation from its long term trend with remittances’ contribution estimated at ¼
of the total appreciation. At the same time, the non-oil trade balance and the non-oil and nonremittances CA deteriorated by 0.5 and 0.7 percent of GDP, respectively. Staff considers this abrupt
movement in the current account as, at least in part, temporary with the economy not been able to
fully adjust to a large external shock in a short period of time.
The financing structure of the current account deficit, high reserves, and low external

Notes: Guatemala's specific elasticities of -0.95 and 1.3 are assumed for exports and imports respectively,
as in Tokarick, 2010. The actual CA for the purposes of the EBA-lite CA methodology has been adjusted to reflect
the abrupt ToT shock and allow for the delayed response of the economy by taking the medium-term CA projection of
-1.7 percent of GDP as a reference. The EBA and EBA-lite CA gaps with respect to the 2015 CA balance would be 3
and 3.2 percent of GDP respectively. The medium term CA norm in the EBA-lite ES model stabilizes NFA at the
Central America's weighted average of -55.5 percent of GDP. Given high remittances and low negative IIP, and the
estimation uncertainty affecting the IREER model, staff believes that the EBA-lite CA methodology better represents
Guatemala's country-specific circumstances.

Staff’s prefered EBA-lite CA methodology suggests that Guatemala’s external position is
moderately stronger than the level consistent with medium term fundamentals and desirable
policies but the divergence with the REER methodology warrants caution in interpretation.
This result, and other estimates under the EBA-lite and EBA approach, captures the one-off effect of
the terms-of-trade and remittances shock in 2015, which has not yet fully worked itself out through
the economy, by assuming that the final adjusted CA balance equals the forecasted medium-term
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

deficit of 1.7 percent of GDP. This adjustment implies that the decline in oil prices and increase in
remittances will be partially reversed while the permanent income windfall is reflected in higher
imports.


The EBA-lite CA methodology based on the CA regression points to a CA gap of 2 percent
of GDP, implying a moderate undervaluation of the REER of 7 percent. A relatively young
population, low income level, and high remittances would warrant a higher-than-observed
current account defict in Guatemala, according to the model. The identified policy
contribution to the CA gap is almost entirely due to the lower-than-desirable fiscal deficit.



The EBA-lite External Sustainability (ES) methodology compares projected medium-term
CA with the level that stabilizes the net foreign assets position, currently at negative 30
percent of GDP, at the regional weighted average of negative 55 percent percent of GDP.
Similarly to the CA methodology, this approach suggests a CA gap of 2 percentage points of
GDP implying a moderate undervaluation of 7 percent.



The EBA-lite Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) Index methodology based on the REER
index regression leads to a very different result, compared to other methodologies,
suggesting an overvaluation of 17 percent. In constrast to the CA methodology, no
adjustment is made for the 2015 shock in this case. This is because a permanent positive
term-of-trade shock, which boosts the real income and wealth, can be expected to leave the
REER more appreciated, as opposed to its limited impact on the currecnt account as
permanent real income and spending will move in tandem once economic agents have
internalized the permanent income windfall.



The EBA CA methodology leads to a reassuringly similar result as those obtained in the
EBA-lite CA and ES methodologies, suggesting a moderate undervaluation of 6 percent.

Given low negative IIP and high remittances, as well as methodological limitations of the REER index
model in countries undergoing large adjustments structural in nature or short data spans, staff
believes that the EBA-lite CA methodology better reflects Guatemala’s country-specific
circumstances.
While there are no indications of serious price competitiveness problems there are signs of
structural competitiveness weaknesses that need to be addressed. Between 2000 and 2015,
Guatemala’s share in global trade decreased by more than 10 percent, but other emerging markets,
excluding China and Asian Tigers, experienced a similar loss during this period (Figure 3). On the
other hand, survey-based competitiveness indicators highlight challenges for Guatemala. The
country maintained its low-ranking position of 78th out of 140 countries in the 2015-16 World
Economic Forum Global Competitiveness Report, although it improved substantially compared to
the 86th position in 2013-14. The weak ranking reflects concerns about crime, corruption, excessive
government bureaucracy, inadequate infrastructure and human capital. Guatemala’s position in the
2016 Ease of Doing Business Index also remained unchanged from 2014 at 81st out of 189 countries,
down from 79th in 2013. The most problematic areas include protecting minority investors,

enforcing contracts, and resolving insolvency. Structural rigidities, which prevent economy’s
adjustment to a new external equilibrium in the face of large external shocks, may also be partly
responsible for a stark divergence between the CA and the REER index EBA-lite results. In particular,
shallow financial systems (Figure 8) could encourage precautionary savings while high crime,
corruption, low human and physical capital and weak legal environment could prevent expansion of
investment projects in the face of a permanent external shock.



Oil prices could be persistently lower, triggered by
supply factors reversing more gradually than
expected.



Insufficient revenue mobilization would deter
investment in physical and human capital.

If protectionism prevails it could slow down
global trade flows, which in turn would
depress global growth, including in a very
open economy like Guatemala.



Ease monetary policy if weak demand
drives inflation below target.



Let automatic fiscal stabilizers operate and
consider discretionary stimulus, including
investment in infrastructure.



Strengthen bank capital buffers to cover
macro-financial risks, and gradually move
towards Basel III standards.



Consider taking additional measures to
discourage dollarization if dollarization
persists and credit quality deteriorates.



Provide emergency liquidity assistance as
needed.



Ease monetary policy if financial distress
weakens demand and drives inflation below
target.



Strengthen risk-based AML/CFT supervision
of the banking sector.



Ease monetary policy if weak demand
drives inflation below target.



Let automatic fiscal stabilizers operate and



Persistently low oil prices would improve
Guatemala’s terms of trade and
counterbalance inflationary pressures,
potentially yielding a modest boost to
growth prospects.



Take advantage of favorable environment
to advance fiscal reforms, including
reforming energy taxes.

High



This could significantly weigh on the
country’s growth and social prospects in the
long run.



Address governance, management and

1/ This path is the baseline through 2021, with a small primary deficit, which stabilizes the debt
ratio thereafter.
2/ Permanent relaxation begins in 2017. It has a primary deficit compatible with an overall deficit of
2 percent of GDP for the entire period.
3/ Temporary relaxation scenario runs a 2 percent of GDP overall deficit between 2017 and 2021,
the deficit declines thereafter.

Safeguards Assessment. Under the Fund’s safeguards assessment policy, the Bank of Guatemala
was subject to an assessment with respect to the Stand-By Arrangement approved on April 22, 2009
(IMF Country Report No: 09/143). The assessment, which was completed in September 2009, found
that the Bank of Guatemala has strengthened safeguards in the areas of transparency of financial
reporting and the management of foreign exchange reserves. Recommendations were made to
further strengthen the bank’s governance and independence.
Exchange Rate Arrangement. Since March 1994, Guatemala has had an arrangement based on an
interbank foreign exchange market in which authorized financial institutions buy and sell foreign
exchange at market-determined rates. Financial institutions authorized to operate in the foreign
exchange market include commercial banks, finance companies, and exchange houses. Guatemala
has a de jure floating exchange rate arrangement, also de facto classified as “floating”. However, the
Bank of Guatemala (BOG) may intervene to limit volatility in the nominal exchange rate without
affecting its trend. The BOG intervenes through foreign exchange auctions based on a transparent
rule that limits daily volatility. Effective January 1, 2016, the fluctuation margin (added to or
subtracted from the five-day moving average of the exchange rate) that determines whether the
BOG may intervene was increased to 0.75% (previously 0.7%) as part of the BOG’s commitment to
increase exchange rate flexibility. The BOG may also intervene whenever the nominal exchange rate
shows unusual volatility. Guatemala has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3 and 4,
and its exchange system is free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current
transactions. As of July 6, 2016 the reference exchange rate was Q7.63 per U.S. dollar.
FSAP Participation. An FSAP Update was carried out during March 18-April 1, 2014, and the
Financial System Stability Assessment was discussed by the Executive Board on September 12, 2014
at the time of the 2014 Article IV consultation.
Article IV Consultation. The last Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on
September 12, 2014.
Resident Representative. Mr. Mario Garza is the Regional Resident Representative for Costa Rica,
Guatemala, and El Salvador, and is based in Guatemala.

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK AND BANK-FUND
COLLABORATION UNDER THE JOINT MANAGEMENT ACTION
PLAN (JMAP)
1.
The IMF’s Guatemala team led by Mrs. Ivanova met on various occasions with the
World Bank’s Guatemala team led by Mrs. Manuela Francisco (Program Leader) to discuss
macroeconomic challenges facing Guatemala, identify macro-critical structural reforms, and
coordinate the two teams’ work for the period July 2015–July 2017.
2.
The teams agreed that Guatemala’s main macroeconomic challenges are to safeguard
macroeconomic stability while addressing social and structural deficiencies.
3.
The teams concurred that Guatemala’s near-term outlook is generally positive, though
there are risks stemming from global uncertainty and domestic policy constraints.
4.
Based on the shared assessment of macroeconomic challenges, the teams have
identified the following structural reform areas as macro-critical


Fiscal Policy. In the short, term, arresting revenue decline, increasing transparency and
efficiency of fiscal spending are priorities. In the long run, raising the level of revenue and
expenditure while prioritizing the latter, would be essential. While not an immediate
concern, rising demographic pressures, if left unaddressed, would pose challenges for the
budget in the longer term.


Revenue mobilization. Guatemala continues to have revenue-to-GDP ratio among
the lowest in the world. The 2012 tax reform has yielded less additional revenue than
anticipated due to the implementation problems and legal challenges. Revenues
declined amid the 2015 political crisis and The World Bank and the IMF, together
with the IADB and the U.S. Treasury have been working in close collaboration in
assisting the new administration to arrest the revenue decline and develop a longterm strategy for strengthening tax and customs administration in the SAT. Going
forward, implementing this strategy and revamping the tax policy framework are key
priorities.



Government spending: level, efficiency, and transparency. Both teams believe
that raising the level, improving the efficiency and composition of public spending as
well as raising its transparency will be critical to achieving social and structural
objectives that will help raise growth and make it more inclusive.



Pension reform. In the longer run, a parametric pension reform will be required to
bring the pension system on a sustainable footing.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

7

GUATEMALA



Monetary policy framework. Strengthening further the monetary framework, including by
improving the monetary transmission mechanism is key to improve the effectiveness of
monetary policy,



Financial sector issues. Guatemala is well placed to apply key Basel III components and is in
compliance with most of the Basel I framework. However, important work remains, including
continued implementation of the risk-based AML/CFT supervision, strengthening bank
resolution framework, fortifying capital buffers, and enhancing consolidated supervision of
financial conglomerates. Strengthening the legal and regulatory frameworks will also be
important for further financial deepening and inclusion. In this regard, approval of the
securities market law and dematerialization of the government bonds market will be
important. Adoption of the national strategy for financial inclusion and measures to reduce
entry costs will help stimulate financial inclusion, spur growth and reduce inequality. The
2016 Article IV IMF mission and the World Bank team, led by Patricia Brenner, held joint
discussions on financial inclusion with the Guatemalan authorities.

5.

The teams agreed on the following division of labor:



Fiscal Policy. The IMF will continue providing advice on the overall strategy for fiscal policy.
The IMF and the World Bank will continue coordinating recommendations on macro-fiscal
issues and conducting the debt sustainability analysis.

8



Revenue mobilization. The IMF has fielded several tax administration missions during
this period, including the mission aimed at assisting the new administration in
developing a strategic plan of the SAT reform in May 2016. The IMF has also fielded a
technical assistance mission on tax policy aimed at significantly raising revenue-to-GDP
ratio in the long run in June, 2016. The Fund will continue providing technical assistance
on the overarching strategy for tax administration and tax policy reforms. It will also
provide support for implementing specific aspects of these reforms through its regional
technical assistance center in Guatemala, CAPTAC-DR. The World Bank together with the
other TA providers will continue providing advice, and on-the-ground support, on the
implementation of these strategies, and is currently preparing a large lending operation
to support the medium-term institutional development agenda in the tax administration.



Government spending: level, efficiency, and transparency. The IMF will take the lead
on defining the overall spending envelope consistent with macroeconomic and social
objectives. The World Bank will take the lead on providing recommendations on
improving the composition and efficiency of public spending as well as financing of
various programs. The Bank completed a Public Expenditure Review in 2013 along with a
database on expenditures at the municipal level. The World Bank is preparing a
Development Policy Loans, which is expected to be approved by the World Bank in the
last quarter of 2016. The IMF has provided technical assistance on fiscal transparency in
April, 2016 and follow up on this advice.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

GUATEMALA



Monetary policy framework. The IMF will continue providing policy recommendations and
technical assistance to improve the monetary framework, including macro-prudential policy
and strengthening of the monetary transmission mechanism.



Financial sector stability. An FSAP follow that in 2014was undertaken in collaboration by
the Fund and the Bank. It identified the main arrears of reforms need to strengthen the
financial system. The World Bank and the IMF will continue cooperating as necessary in
assisting Guatemala to follow up on the 2014 FSAP recommendations, bringing the financial
framework in compliance with the 2012 FATF standards, and continue effectively
implementing risk-based AML/CFT supervision.

6.

The teams have the following requests for information from their counterparts:



The Fund team requests to be kept informed of progress in the above macro-critical
structural reform areas. Timing: when milestones are reached (and at least semi-annually).



The Bank team requests to be kept informed of the Fund’s assessments of macroeconomic
policies and prospects, including updates of the Fund’s macroeconomic framework, and
progress in the above macro-critical structural reform areas.

The attached table lists the teams’ separate and joint work programs during August 2016–July
2017.

RELATIONS WITH THE INTER-AMERICAN DEVELOPMENT
BANK
(As of June 2016)

A. Recent Projects and Objectives
1.
On December 2012, the IADB approved its country strategy for Guatemala for
2012–2016. It focuses on improving living conditions for the Guatemalan population, particularly
those living in rural areas. The strategy’s priority target areas were structured along two axes, the first
institutional, covering the areas of (i) fiscal and municipal management, (ii) social protection, and
(ii) peaceful coexistence and citizen security; and the second addressing rural development, including
the areas of (iv) productive development, (v) health, and (vi) transportation. The strategy also identified
crosscutting work areas of climate change adaptation and mitigation, natural disaster impact
mitigation, indigenous peoples and gender; and regional integration. The IADB is currently working

has also actively participated in the collaborative effort of multiple donors on providing the assistance
to the new administration on the SAT reform. IADB has participated as well in the IMF technical
assistance mission on fiscal transparency.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of July 1, 2016)

Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance.
National accounts: In 2010, the Bank of Guatemala (Banguat) began publishing quarterly
national accounts statistics consistent with the SNA 1993, with 2001 as the base year. In addition,
a new monthly index of economic activity (IMAE) consistent with the quarterly and annual
accounts is disseminated on a regular basis since June, 2013. The Banguat has started the national
accounts rebasing process that will be completed in 2017 and disseminated in December 2018,
with 2013 as the new base year.
Consumer prices and unemployment: In 2011, the consumer price index was re-based to
December, 2010, and the index weights were updated to reflect changes in the consumption
basket since the base 2000 index. Unemployment is estimated only on an biannual basis.
Government finance statistics: Revenue, expenditure, and financing statistics for social security
agencies, local governments, and nonfinancial public enterprises are not reported, hindering the
calculation of a consolidated operations statement and balance sheet for the nonfinancial public
sector. The coverage and periodicity of data on central government financing and debt is
adequate.
Monetary and financial statistics: Monetary and financial statistics are reported on a regular
monthly basis to STA using the standardized report forms (SRFs) for the central bank, other
depository corporations, and other financial corporations (OFCs). OFCs comprise insurance
companies, warehouses and exchange houses. Monetary data exclude credit card companies,
securities dealers, other financial intermediaries, and other financial auxiliaries.
Financial sector surveillance: The authorities report on monthly basis all 12 core financial

soundness indicators (FSIs) and 10 (out of 13) of the encouraged set for the deposit taking sector.
The authorities are working for expanding the FSI coverage of the OFCs sector.
External sector statistics: External sector statistics: Guatemala has made significant progress
on the prerequisites for data quality as well as on methodological soundness of concepts and
definitions, scope, classification, and basis for recording. The legislation on the obligation of the
private sector to provide information to the Bank of Guatemala for statistical purposes is still
pending, which affects the response rate to balance of payments surveys and limits the availability
of the required information. On dissemination of external sector statistics, Guatemala has
successfully: (1) migrated to the sixth edition of the Balance of Payments and International
Investment Position Manual (BPM6); (2) disseminated the Reserves Data Template; (3)

disseminated comprehensive inward/outward data on the Coordinated Direct Investment Survey
(CDIS), and; (4) provided total external debt statistics by sector on the World Bank’s website
Data Standards and Quality
Guatemala participates in the enhanced
General Data Dissemination System (e-GDDS)
and meets nearly all of the recommended
periodicity and timeliness recommendations of
the e-GDDS.

A data ROSC was completed on October 28,
