Staff Report for the 2010 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives of the Western Hemisphere Department
(In consultation with other departments)
Approved by Miguel A. Savastano and Tamim Bayoumi
August 25, 2010
Executive Summary
Context. Since 2008, Chile’s economy has successfully withstood two large adverse shocks—
the global financial crisis and a devastating earthquake in February 2010. The economy’s
resilience has been underpinned by a strong policy framework, a well-capitalized banking
system, and the absence of imbalances in the private sector. Real output growth is expected to
recover strongly in 2010–11, driven by reconstruction spending and a rebuilding of inventories.
In concluding the 2009 Article IV consultation, Directors strongly supported Chile’s policy
framework and highlighted its track record of exemplary policies, but encouraged the
authorities to consider extending the horizon for fiscal policy formulation.
Policy discussions. Staff supported the authorities’ intention to start withdrawing fiscal
stimulus in 2011 even with higher spending on reconstruction and normalizing the stance of
monetary policy. Staff agreed with the authorities’ decision to review the fiscal rule, with a
view to enhancing its effectiveness, and their plans to develop further domestic financial
markets and strengthen the prudential framework. The discussions also covered options to
better align the fiscal rule with international best practice, policy responses to a possible surge
in capital inflows and steps to increase productivity growth.
Analytical Work. Background studies include options for strengthening Chile’s fiscal
framework, assessing the extent of “too-connected-to-fail” risk through network analysis,
estimating potential output, and measuring the effects of terms of trade shocks on income
distribution.
The 2010 Article IV consultation discussions were held in Santiago during July 19–30. The
team comprised R. Rennhack (Head), D. Iakova, J. Chan-Lau, T. Daban, and N. Magud (all
WHD). M. Ricaurte (OED) participated in the meetings. The mission met with Finance
Minister Larraín, Governor of the Central Bank of Chile De Gregorio, other senior officials and
representatives of the private sector.
Exchange Rate System. Chile has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4
and maintains an exchange rate system free of restrictions on the making of payments and
transfers for current international transactions, and a floating exchange rate.
OECD membership: Chile joined the OECD in May 2010.

I. CONTEXT
1.
Since 2008, Chile’s economy has successfully withstood two large adverse
shocks—the global financial crisis and a devastating earthquake in February 2010.
Chile’s resilience has been underpinned by a strong policy framework (a fiscal rule, inflation
targeting and exchange rate flexibility), a well-capitalized banking system, and the absence
of imbalances in the private sector. In

increases, reprioritization of spending, and
some borrowing. With large fiscal savings accumulated over the past decade, and a proven
track record of low inflation and prudent banking practices, these sizable policy responses
have not compromised confidence in economic policies.
II. OUTLOOK FOR 2010
2.
A strong economic recovery is underway, and staff projects that real GDP will
grow by 5 percent in 2010 (Figure 1 and Table 1). After contracting sharply after the
collapse of Lehman, real GDP grew at an annualized rate of 7 percent in the second half of
2009. Domestic demand led the recovery, supported by the substantial easing of fiscal and
monetary policies. Consumer and business confidence strengthened as the global economy
stabilized and Chile’s terms of trade improved. Growth was temporarily disrupted by the
end-February earthquake, but resumed in the second quarter of 2010. Strong private
consumption and large private and public investment, including on inventories, are expected
to sustain domestic demand growth.

1

As discussed in last year’s Article IV report, the government announced a sizable fiscal stimulus in January
2009, followed by the adoption of measures to facilitate credit in March 2009, and the expansion of subsidies in
May 2009. The central bank started to provide liquidity to the financial system in October 2008 and in
January 2009 started lowering the policy interest rate (from 8.25 percent to 0.5 percent by July 2009).

4
3.
With diminishing spare capacity in the economy, inflation is expected to rise to
3.7 percent by end-2010. The rapid growth of domestic demand has contributed to strong
real import growth and to a rise in domestic inflation (consumer prices increased by
2.2 percent y/y in July, after falling by 1.4 percent during 2009, Figure 2). At the same time,
the earthquake is likely to have caused a transitory decline in the level of potential output.
Staff’s estimates suggest that Chile’s output gap would average about 2 percent of GDP in
2010, and would close in 2011 (Box 1).
4.
The rebound in growth, together with higher copper prices, will help narrow the
fiscal deficit in 2010. The central government deficit is projected to decline to 1¾ percent of
GDP in 2010 (from 4.4 percent of GDP in 2009), reflecting a recovery in tax revenues from
both the mining and non-mining sectors and lower current expenditure (Figure 3 and Table
2). The revenue gains are being supported by efforts to restore tax compliance, which
declined during 2009, as well as temporary tax increases. On the expenditure side, the end of
several of the temporary stimulus measures adopted in 2009 and the government’s efforts to
improve expenditure efficiency are expected to lower real expenditure growth to 9 percent
(from almost 20 percent the year before). Staff estimates that the reconstruction spending
would raise the structural deficit (the balance with revenues measured at potential output and
the long-term trend copper price) to about4.1 percent of GDP in 2010, from 3.1 percent of
GDP in 2009.2 The net financial asset position of the central government is projected to
decline to 14 percent of GDP by the end of 2010, from a peak of 20 percent of GDP in 2008
(Table 3).
5.
Financing conditions have eased and credit growth is picking up. After tightening
significantly in late 2008 and early 2009, credit conditions for both corporations and
households have eased, and credit growth resumed (Figure 4). Lending rates have declined in
the course of 2009, in line with the reduction of the policy rate. Corporate bond spreads have
also declined to their pre-crisis levels. The normalization of liquidity conditions allowed the
central bank to terminate in June 2010 the temporary short-term bank liquidity facility set up
during the crisis.
6.
The central bank started raising the policy rate in June 2010 to help moderate
the pace of demand growth. After three consecutive monthly increases, the policy rate
stands at 2 percent in August 2010. Inflation expectations for end-2010 are above the
3 percent target, but remain anchored at target at the end of the 24-month policy horizon.

2

Staff calculations of the structural balance in 2009-10 rely on staff estimates of the output gap, which are
smaller than the authorities’ estimates used to calculate the structural balance. Based on the interim findings of
the fiscal rule commission, the authorities revised their estimates of the structural deficit to 3.1 percent of GDP
in 2009 and 3.2 percent of GDP in 2010, from 1.2 percent of GDP and 1.6 percent of GDP, respectively.

5
7.
Chile’s external position remains strong. The net international investment position
has improved by about US$30 billion since mid-2009, largely due to valuation gains on the
assets held abroad by institutional investors (Figure 6). The external current account is
projected to shift from a surplus of 2½ percent of GDP in 2009 to a deficit of about 1 percent
of GDP in 2010, as real import

8.
The financial system weathered the crisis well, with only a moderate cyclical
deterioration in credit quality. Non-performing loans remain relatively low, at 3 percent of
all loans. Banks are well capitalized and have a relatively stable funding base (Figure 7).
Provisioning levels have strengthened, in part due to stricter provisioning requirements in
place since January 2010. Annual bank credit growth to the private sector has recovered to
7.5 percent in mid-2010.

III. MEDIUM TERM OUTLOOK AND RISKS
9.
Real GDP growth is expected to accelerate to about 6 percent in 2011, and
thereafter converge to the potential output growth rate of about 4½ percent (Table 4).
The staff baseline scenario assumes that the overall position of the central government will
return to virtual balance by 2014, and its net financial assets will remain close to 15 percent
of GDP. The current account deficit is expected to stabilize at around 2¼ percent of GDP,
financed mainly by continued net foreign direct investment. Net international reserves are
projected to remain stable, given central bank commitment to exchange rate flexibility.

6
10.
While near term risks are broadly
balanced, Chile remains vulnerable to global
economic shocks over the medium term. In
the near term, strong consumer and business
confidence, underpinned by large reconstruction
spending and still easy financing conditions,
could translate into a greater-than-expected
boost to demand and a faster than envisaged
narrowing of the output gap. However, as a
highly open and financially integrated economy,
heavily dependent on copper exports and oil
imports, Chile remains vulnerable to volatility
in world commodity prices, global growth, and
capital markets (see chart).

IV. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
11.
The authorities are committed to preserving macroeconomic stability,
strengthening further the policy framework, and creating incentives to boost
productivity. They noted that the fiscal rule in place since 2001 had been critical in helping
the government effectively manage the effects of the global financial crisis and the 2010
earthquake. However, recent experience with implementation of the rule showed that certain
aspects of it could be improved, and for that purpose the government convened a high-level
commission with the task of recommending reforms to the fiscal rule. The authorities also
stressed that a key priority of the new government is to create conditions to accelerate
productivity growth. Key initiatives in this area include increasing the efficiency of the
public sector, and securing legislative approval for comprehensive capital market reforms.
Fiscal Policy
12.
The authorities emphasized that expenditure restraint would anchor fiscal policy
over the medium term. They noted that, even with the additional spending on
reconstruction in 2010–12, they aimed to reduce the structural deficit to 1 percent of GDP by
2014, which would require a cautious expenditure policy. Staff and the authorities agreed
that to ensure a consistent policy mix and moderate exchange rate appreciation pressures, a
gradual withdrawal of fiscal stimulus should start in 2011, while still allowing room for
reconstruction expenditure. Detailed fiscal plans for 2011 and for the medium term will be
released in September, when the draft 2011 budget is sent to Congress. The authorities
estimated that the government’s share of the estimated total reconstruction costs of about
US$30 billion would be on the order of US$8.4 billion (4 percent of GDP) over 2010–13,
which would be financed through insurance reimbursements, improved efficiency and
reallocation of spending, temporary tax increases, and debt issuance. The authorities noted
that the temporary tax increases would help avoid a compression of spending in the near
term, and would be combined with a productivity-enhancing extension of the reduction in the

7
stamp tax on financial transactions and some tax breaks for small and medium sized
enterprises (text table). In July the government placed a US$1 billion 10-year bond at a
spread of 90 basis points, and sold a US$500 million peso-linked bond to international
investors at an interest rate of 5.5 percent.

Staff supported the authorities’ goal of narrowing the structural deficit to 1
percent of GDP by 2014. It noted that attaining this goal would entail keeping the growth of
government spending below the growth rate of output for most of this administration
(assuming broadly an unchanged tax burden and stable long-term copper prices). Staff
discussed a scenario where the headline

deficit would remain about 3 percent of
GDP in 2011, and gradually fall to a deficit of 1 percent of GDP by 2014. This fiscal profile
would result in a gradual withdrawal of the 2009 fiscal stimulus between 2011 and 2014,
which would help avoid undue compression of expenditure at the end of the period. While
staff supported the fiscal target for 2014, it stressed that it would be prudent to return the
structural position to balance over a longer horizon, say by 2016, to signal the intention to
keep fiscal policy neutral over the long term and preserve the net financial position of the
government on a sustained basis. To this end, staff suggested that any rise in the structural
revenues caused by upward revisions in the long-term copper price could be used to reduce
the structural deficit faster than currently planned. The authorities noted that the current
institutional framework required the government to formulate goals for fiscal policy only
during its term.

8
14.
Staff welcomed the government’s decision to establish a commission to review
the fiscal rule. In late August 2010, the commission published its interim report and
recommended revisions to the methodology for calculating the structural balance. The final
report (due by November 2010) will consider the scope for broader reforms to the rule,
possibly including proposals to modify its countercyclical role and strengthen its institutional
basis. Staff noted that the rule in place since 2001 has helped stabilize spending growth and
accumulate sizable net financial assets during the copper price boom, but could be improved
in several aspects. Staff analysis, drawing on best international practices (Annex 1), suggests
the following points to consider in reviewing the design of the rule:3


Make the calculation of the structural balance more transparent and easy to
replicate.



Introduce an explicit escape clause to allow for discretionary countercyclical policy
in the case of large shocks.



Complement the rule with a medium-term policy framework that would extend
beyond the 4-year presidential term to provide a clear path for returning to the fiscal
target after temporary deviations.



Minimize unintended procyclicality. An expenditure growth ceiling could help
prevent procyclical increases in public spending in the event of a significant
increase in the long-term copper price.



Expand the role of the expert committees to include an ex-post assessment of the
implementation of the rule and consider the adoption of a full “fiscal council”
system to increase further fiscal transparency and accountability.



Complement the rule with an indicative target for the government’s long-term net
financial assets, taking into account contingent liabilities.

The authorities agreed with the recommendations in the interim report but wanted to
carefully review the final report before offering any views on possible reforms to the rule.
15.
Staff encouraged the fiscal authorities to continue the recapitalization of the
central bank. Between 2006 and 2008, the government reduced the estimated capital
shortfall of the central bank to ½ percent of GDP, but these transfers were suspended in
2009.4 Completing the recapitalization of the central bank would help strengthen further its
credibility, without affecting the overall asset position of the general government. The
3
4

See “Strengthening Chile’s Rule-Based Fiscal Framework” in the Selected Issues Papers.

The 2006 Fiscal Responsibility Law established a mechanism for the central government to gradually
recapitalize the central bank in years of fiscal surplus. In line with the law, these transfers stopped in 2009 when
the countercyclical fiscal stimulus moved the central government’s overall balance into deficit.

9
authorities replied that they would review a report on the capital position of the central bank
before deciding on the next steps.
Monetary Policy
16.
Monetary policy has appropriately moved to a tightening stance since June.
The strengthening economic outlook calls for further tightening in the coming months, as
envisaged in the latest Monetary Policy Report. Market expectations suggest that the policy
rate will increase to 5.5 percent by early 2012.
17.
Staff noted that the widening of interest rate and growth differentials with
major advanced economies could trigger capital inflows. Staff and the authorities agreed
that in the event of a surge of capital inflows, the first line of defense should be to allow
nominal exchange rate appreciation, possibly accompanied by macroprudential policies to
limit excessive growth in credit. Staff suggested that possible prudential measures could
include higher bank reserve requirements, countercyclical provisioning or capital
requirements, and limits on loan-to-value and loan-to-deposit ratios. Limits and/or higher
capital requirements on banks’ forward foreign exchange positions could also be considered
in the case of excessive exchange rate volatility. The authorities noted that there were a wide
range of macroprudential measures that could be considered, and the choice would be
tailored to the specific situation and coordinated with the supervisory agencies. In some
cases, these measures would require legislative approval. Staff agreed with the central bank’s
view that intervention in the foreign exchange market would be warranted only in the case of
extreme exchange rate misalignments, accompanied by the risk of disruptions in domestic
financial markets, in line with the framework for sterilized interventions in place since 2000.5
Strengthening the Financial System
18.
Staff and the authorities agreed that domestic credit risks would diminish
further as the recovery firms up. The earthquake could have a limited temporary impact on
credit risk in the affected zones, as indicated in the latest financial stability report of the
central bank. However, for the banking system as a whole, this effect is expected to be offset
by the rebound of economic activity and lower unemployment. Stress tests conducted by the
central bank suggest that banks’ capital ratios will remain above minima, even if economic
conditions deteriorate and the cost of financing increases relative to the baseline projections.
Staff and the authorities also agreed that the risk of financial contagion from Europe
appeared to be contained, as the large domestic banks that are subsidiaries of Spanish and
U.S. banks have a stable domestic funding base (Figure 8 and Box 2).6 As of April 2010,
external funding was only 9 percent of total liabilities and most of it was long-term debt.
5
6

The central bank has intervened only on three occasions since 2000.

A more detailed analysis is presented in “Too-Connected-to-Fail (TCTF) Risk in the Chilean Banking
System” in the Selected Issues Papers.

10
19.
The authorities remain committed to continue financial sector reforms. These
reforms are intended to further strengthen the prudential framework and deepen domestic
capital markets, which should be beneficial for productivity growth. The third capital market
reforms law (MKIII), approved by Congress in May 2010, broadens the universe of
authorized financial instruments, including exchange-traded funds and mortgage bonds;
facilitates the process of securitization; and extends tax exemptions on selected fixed income
instruments to foreign institutional investors. In addition, the government is developing
another set of reforms (the bicentennial capital market reform or MKB) to improve further
the liquidity of financial markets and update the institutional framework, especially in the
areas of consolidated supervision and corporate governance of the financial supervisors
(Box 3).
20.
The staff fully supported these initiatives, and suggested possible additional
measures to strengthen further the regulatory and supervisory framework.7 These
included: (i) adopting a functional approach to regulation and supervision to limit regulatory
arbitrage and facilitate systemic risk assessment; (ii) formalizing cooperative supervisory
arrangements among the three supervisory agencies, including by setting up a systemic risk
council; (iii) strengthening cross-border coordination with international counterparts;
(iv) addressing information gaps to help identify vulnerabilities and price misalignments; and
(v) using a regulatory benchmark model and common assumptions to assess the adequacy of
dynamic loan loss provisions. The authorities agreed with the staff’s view that a functional
approach, similar to the one currently applied to investment funds and mortgage financing,
would broaden the perimeter of regulation to currently unregulated entities and improve the
uniformity of regulatory standards. They added that the three main supervisory agencies—the
SBIF (banking), the SVS (securities and insurance), and SP (pensions)—are currently
implementing a pilot exercise on consolidated supervision of financial conglomerates, with a
view to setting up a formal framework for cooperation. They also agreed that addressing
information gaps is important and noted that they are expanding the set of data collected
from financial conglomerates. Staff supported the planned adoption of dynamic provisioning,
and suggested that it could be complemented by the introduction of countercyclical capital
buffers to reduce macroprudential risks associated with procyclical credit expansion.
Enhancing Productivity Growth
21.
Staff also supported the government’s other initiatives to enhance productivity
growth. In 2010, Chile ranked 49th in the World Bank’s Doing Business Indicators,
reflecting relatively high costs for starting a business, inefficient bankruptcy procedures, and
labor market regulations that favor short-term subcontracting. The government is planning
reforms aimed at increasing competition, facilitating the entry of new firms, making credit
more accessible to small and medium-enterprises, and improving bankruptcy regulations. It
7

See Annex 2 for a concise description of the financial system and the supervisory framework.

11
also plans to establish a specialized stock market to facilitate initial public offerings for startups and increase the availability of venture capital. Staff agreed with the authorities that
replacing the current high severance payment system with a more comprehensive
unemployment insurance scheme could help increase labor market mobility and encourage
greater investment in education and on-the-job training. Increasing the share of skilled
workers in the labor force could also help reduce income inequality.8 Staff also noted that
relatively high minimum wages in Chile—45 percent of the average wage compared to the
OECD average of 40 percent—could increase youth unemployment and contribute to the
growth of the informal sector.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
22.
Chile’s economy has shown remarkable resilience in the past two years. The
economic recovery is fully underway, helped by appropriate policy responses to the two large
adverse shocks. The recent success in tapping international capital markets on very favorable
terms attests to the strong market confidence that macroeconomic stability will be preserved.
23.
Fiscal policy played a critical countercyclical role, drawing on the public
savings accumulated prior to the global crisis. The 2009 fiscal stimulus helped support an
early recovery of economic activity. The planned withdrawal of the fiscal stimulus was
delayed by the demands on government spending placed by the devastating earthquake of
February 2010. The government has adopted a prudent approach to financing the emergency
spending through reprioritization of other expenditure, temporary tax increases, efficiency
gains, and some debt issuance. The government’s commitment to firm expenditure restraint
starting in 2011 is important to ensure that fiscal policy helps reduce the risk of overheating
and limit exchange rate appreciation pressures.
24.
Staff supports the authorities’ goal of reducing the structural deficit of the
central government to 1 percent of GDP by 2014. The target is challenging, as it implies
firm expenditure restraint over a number of years. However, over a longer horizon, it would
be advisable to return the structural position of the central government to balance in order to
keep the government’s discretionary fiscal policy neutral while preserving its net financial
assets. Thus, any increase in the long-term copper price could be used to reduce the structural
deficit even faster. Staff encourages the government to renew its commitment to fully
recapitalize the central bank.
25.
The government’s decision to review the fiscal rule is welcome. While the rule
has worked well and is one of the main pillars of Chile’s policy framework, its design can be
refined to make the rule even more effective. Areas for improvement include making the rule
more transparent and easier to replicate; introducing an explicit escape clause and features to
limit unintended procyclicality in spending; complementing the rule with an explicit

medium-term policy framework that extends beyond the term of each government; and
strengthening accountability through ex-post assessment of compliance. Once the
commission has issued its final report, the government could limit any uncertainty by
outlining a clear timetable for adopting any revisions to the rule.
26.
Staff supports the recent shift of monetary policy to a tightening stance.
Diminishing spare capacity in the economy calls for continuing withdrawal of monetary
stimulus to bring inflation in line with the target by the end of the 24-month policy horizon.
The implementation of monetary policy could become challenging, however, if the widening
interest rate and growth differentials with major advanced economies lead to a surge in
capital inflows. Staff supports the central bank’s intention to rely on exchange rate flexibility
as the first line on defense to mitigate the risk of excessive inflows, and notes that the central
bank has intervened in the foreign exchange market only on three occasions since 2000 under
exceptional conditions. It also supports the central bank’s willingness to consider
macroprudential measures to help prevent excessive growth in credit.
27.
The financial system has weathered the crisis well, but a further strengthening
of the prudential framework would be beneficial. The planned introduction of
consolidated supervision of financial conglomerates will allow a more comprehensive
assessment of risks. In addition, it would be important to adopt a functional approach to
regulation and supervision, which would facilitate a broadening of the perimeter of
supervision to include nonbank credit providers. Other important reforms that could enhance
systemic risk surveillance include formalizing cooperation arrangements among the
supervisory agencies, strengthening cross-border coordination with international
counterparts, and addressing information gaps to help identify potential vulnerabilities. The
cooperation arrangements should also include the consumer protection agency, once it
becomes operational.
28.
Staff supports the authorities’ focus on fostering faster productivity growth.
Government initiatives to reduce the cost of doing business by increasing competition,
facilitating the entry of new firms, making credit more accessible to small and mediumenterprises, and reforming the corporate bankruptcy procedure are welcome. Increasing labor
market efficiency should be another key objective. Replacing the current high severance
payment system with a more comprehensive unemployment insurance scheme, for example,
would increase labor mobility and encourage greater investment in education and on-the-job
training.
29.
Staff proposes that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard
12-month cycle.

Box 1. Measuring Chile’s Output Gap 1/

Kalman filter estimates give a similar
range. The three lines in the second chart
correspond to estimates from a backwardlooking Phillips curve (M1), with inflation
deviations positively linked to the output
gap, a backward-looking IS curve model
(M2), and an Okun’s law approach (M3)
relating the output gap and deviations of
the unemployment rate from NAIRU.

Using linear filters, the output gap is
estimated about 2–3 percent in Q1-2010.
The top chart shows the results from a
piece-wise linear trend, the HodrickPrescott filter (HP), the Baxter and King
band-pass filter (BK), and the ChristianoFitzgerald (CF) method. The results are

Staff estimates suggest that Chile’s
output gap was about 2–3 percent as of
end-2009. The results, obtained using
several different estimation methods,
suggest that the ongoing recovery should
close the output gap by mid-2011.

production function approach, a structural

Box 2. Too-Connected-to-Fail (TCTF) Risk in the Chilean Banking System 2/
Proper systemic surveillance requires the assessment of too-connected-to-fail risk
in the banking system. Any banking system is vulnerable to negative spillovers from
the failure of individual institutions. The spillovers could be transmitted through direct
exposures (such as losses incurred from claims on the defaulted institution or the
sudden withdrawal of funding from a creditor), indirect exposures (such as mark-tomarket losses due to declining asset prices from asset fire sales prompted by the
default), or a combination of both.
Balance sheet network analysis suggests that, within Chile’s banking system,
TCTF risk from direct exposures is small. Balance sheet data from the banking
supervisory agency (SBIF) suggests that interbank exposure, relative to banks’ capital,
is relatively small. This suggests that Chilean banks are relatively insulated from credit
shocks (losses on claims on a defaulted bank) and funding shocks (sudden withdrawal
of funds by a creditor). In the worst case, some banks would experience an average loss
of 6-10 percent of their capital.
The main source of TCTF risk in Chile is associated with funding from domestic
non-bank financial institutions and foreign banks. A sudden withdrawal of funding
from foreign banks could induce an average capital loss of 17 percent, and up to
22 percent if combined with a credit shock. If domestic non-bank financial institutions
were to withdraw their funding, the average capital loss would exceed 40 percent of the
capital of the banking system. The likelihood of such event, however, is very small.

Box 3. Bicentennial Capital Markets Reform (MKB)
The new financial markets reform initiative, announced on May 5, 2010, rests on the
following seven pillars:
Updating the institutional framework, including implementing consolidated
supervision of financial conglomerates; strengthening of the corporate governance of
the securities and insurance supervisory agency; increasing the autonomy of the
banking supervisory agency, and updating the bankruptcy law for non-financial
corporations.
Reducing credit procyclicality and upgrading the solvency and liquidity
requirements for financial institutions.
Enhancing information and transparency in the financial system through further
integration of securities exchanges, improved price information in exchange markets,
minimum professional certification requirements for financial sector employees, and
the use of “Chinese walls” to prevent the misuse of inside information.
Reforming the taxation framework to simply the value added tax on investment
funds and the tax treatment of fixed income instruments and derivatives products.
Creating a financial consumer protection agency.
Improving market access for middle class households and small and medium
enterprises through increased banking services to households, reduction of initial
public offering costs, and further incentives for venture capital.
Developing new markets and financial products to reduce financing costs,
including the development of a high yield bond market, better access to foreign
exchange hedging by small firms, and the provision of a sound legal framework
governing microfinance institutions.

ANNEX 1. CHILE’S FISCAL RULE FROM AN OECD PERSPECTIVE
Compared to practices in other OECD economies, Chile’s fiscal rule presents several
strengths, but also some shortcomings. The differences between Chile’s fiscal rule, and the
practices in the other 27 OECD economies that have a fiscal rule could be usefully grouped in
the seven categories listed below:
OECD Practices

Chile’s Fiscal Rule

Clear statutory
basis

In most OECD countries fiscal rules are
supported by special legislation
(e.g. national law, guidelines or
supranational agreements) that usually
includes stringent procedural rules on
accountability, transparency and fiscal
stability, as well as key budget principles.

Chile’s Fiscal Responsibility Law (FRL) of
2006 does not provide much guidance on the
design and practical implementation of the
fiscal. The FRL only mandates (i) that the
President of the Republic enacts, within the 90
days of entering office, a decree indicating
how the fiscal policy planned for his/her
administration will affect the structural
balance; and (ii) that the Budget Directorate
calculates the structural balance. The nature,
rationale, and methodology for the calculation
of the structural balance rule have been
usually explained in policy papers issued by
the Budget Directorate.

Clear targets

The legislation on fiscal rules in most
OECD countries typically includes clear
methodological principles and definitions
for the fiscal covered by the rule; normally,
these comprise targets on gross or net public
debt, on several definitions of deficit
(overall, structural balance, primary
balance, non-oil primary balance), on tax
ratios, and on the growth rate of government
expenditure.

Chile’s FRL defines the structural balance, as
the difference between the central government
revenues and expenditures that would have
been obtained if, in any given year, the
economy was operating at potential and the
copper price was at its (estimated) long-term
level. The initial methodology outlined by the
Budget Directorate to calculate the structural
balance was easy to understand and replicate.
However, the computation of the structural
balance has became increasingly complex and
difficult to replicate over the years owing to
the expansion of the private mining sector, the
introduction of new taxes on mining, the
coming into stream of output of non-copper
minerals (e.g. molybdenum), and nontransparent changes in the elasticities of tax
collections with respect to the output gap.

Clear
objectives

The rationale for fiscal rules is usually
spelled out clearly in special legislation or
guidelines. The objectives of fiscal rules in
OECD countries typically include ensuring
public debt sustainability, addressing
common pool problems in highly
decentralized countries or within

A 2001 policy paper of the Budget Directorate
spelled out the objectives of Chile’s fiscal
rule. The paper noted that the structural
surplus targeted with the rule (1 percent of
GDP at the time) was to be used to
recapitalize the central bank, pre-finance
contingent liabilities, and create a buffer of net

international arrangements, avoiding
domestic demand pressures, and tackling
ageing-related issues.

financial assets to allow the central
government to absorb external shocks. The
2006 FRL, however, did not refer to these
objectives, and only stipulated the creation of
two separate sovereign funds for the allocation
of overall surpluses.

Clear link
between
targets and
objectives

Fiscal rules in OECD countries usually set
targets/benchmarks on several fiscal
indicators covering both sustainability and
cyclicality aspects of fiscal policy. The most
common are (i) an upper limit on gross or
net public debt and ceilings on one or
several definitions of deficit (e.g. Maastricht
Treaty and the Stability and Growth Pact);
and (ii) ceilings for the overall balance and
the growth rate of expenditures, either in
nominal or real terms (e.g. Sweden, Finland,
Netherlands).

Chile’s structural balance rule does not
establish a clear link with medium-term fiscal
goals. The rule is not formulated within a fullfledged medium-term framework nor is it used
to assess how current policies would affect the
government’s net financial wealth. Moreover,
the upward revision of the long-term copper
price in recent years has imparted an
unintended procyclicality to government
expenditures.

Flexibility

Fiscal rules in most OECD countries
include provisions to deal with unexpected
shocks. These provisions allow temporary
deviations from the targets and provide
guidance for a gradual adjustment to those
targets, while avoiding procyclicatlity and
preserving credibility. The most common
provisions include: (i) “exceptional
circumstances clauses” that allow for
temporary deviations in the face of major
shocks; (ii) “notional accounts” to store
small ex-post deviations, which would be
corrected overtime (e.g. Germany and
Switzerland); and (iii) clear procedures to
undertake periodic and rolling adjustments
of the numerical targets.

Chile’s rule is, in principle, quite flexible, as it
does not constrain the government’s capacity
to modify the structural balance target. In fact
the target has been changed over time for
several reasons, and the changes have been
usually justified by analytical work. However,
Chile’s fiscal framework does not provide
much guidance on how to introduce changes
to the target or how to implement a
discretionary response to a shock. In terms of
ex-post compliance, Chile’s FRL does not
contain mechanisms to assess small ex-post
deviations or eliminate them over time.

Transparency
provisions

OECD legislation on fiscal rules usually
contains provisions to promote full
transparency of fiscal policy plans and expost fiscal performance. Through these
provisions the public is generally well
informed of deviations and of plans to
correct them over time.

Chile’s FRL does not include provisions to
promote full transparency (either of the exante calculation of the structural balance or
ex-post performance). The only requirement is
that the Budget Directorate computes the
structural balance every year. The government
monitors fiscal performance on an ongoing
basis and has showed a strong responsiveness
to new informational demands, even though
not required by law. Because of those actions,
understanding of Chile’s rule by the public is
quite high, in spite of its complexity.

34

Accountability.

OECD Practices

Chile’s Fiscal Rule

A large number of OECD countries have
created independent fiscal councils to
provide independent fiscal policy analysis
and recommendations. The councils usually
provide: (i) objective analysis of current
fiscal policy; (ii) independent projections
and forecasts of key macrofiscal variables;
and (iii) an assessment on the application of
the rule, and the quality of the fiscal
adjustment to comply. Typically, the
councils only have an advisory role, and are
accountable to the legislative branch.

Chile fiscal framework delegates to two
independent panels of experts the
determination of critical inputs for the
calculation of the structural balance (the longterm copper price, and the rates of growth of
the labor force, capital accumulation, and total
factor productivity). The composition of the
panels and their main recommendations are
published by the Budget Directorate on a
regular basis. However, the recommendations
of the panels are not binding, and the law does
not assign to any third party the task of
assessing compliance with the rule.

ANNEX 2. CHILE—FINANCIAL SYSTEM DEVELOPMENTS
A. The Financial System
30.
The financial system is large and well diversified. The financial system comprises
mainly commercial banks, pension funds, insurance companies and securities market
intermediaries. Three of the largest locally incorporated banks (accounting for 44 percent of
bank assets) are partly owned by foreign banks (Santander, Banco de Chile, BBVA).

Non-banks play an important role in credit provision. Non-banks, including
department stores, cooperatives, and others, account for about 45 percent of total consumer
debt and about 15 percent of mortgage debt.
32.
The country is highly
integrated within the global financial
system. Consolidated banking statistics
from the BIS indicate that in 2009Q4,
claims on Chile by BIS reporting banks
amounted to $86 billion (52 percent of
GDP), slightly above their pre-crisis
levels and 25 percent above their lows
in 2008Q4. Spanish banks claims on
Chile, at $53¾ billion, were back to the
pre-global financial crisis levels. Claims
by Brazilian banks increased five-fold
to $5¾ billion during 2009.

B. The Regulatory and Surveillance Framework
33.
Financial supervision is performed by three separate institutions. The institutions
are the banking supervisory agency (SBIF), the securities and insurance supervisory agency
(SVS), and the pension fund supervisory agency (SP). Supervisory coordination takes place
through the Committee of Superintendents, in which the central bank has an observer role.
The Committee also includes a technical secretariat which coordinates technical work related
to risk-based supervision and the analysis of domestic financial markets, and liaises with
foreign counterparts and other international bodies. The OECD has recommended adopting
formal cooperation arrangements such as information sharing protocols. Domestic banks and
branches of international banks, insurance companies, and exchanges are under the direct
supervision of one of the three main supervisory agencies. These agencies are currently
cooperating in a pilot exercise on consolidated supervision of financial conglomerates with a
view to setting up a formal supervisory framework. A consolidated supervision law to be
finalized by end-2010 or early 2011 would provide the required legal framework.
34.
. Addressing information gaps with respect to transactions and positions
involving foreign exchange was considered adequate given the high level of disclosure
and information collection by the authorities, and the relatively simple instruments,
investment and trading strategies used by financial institutions. Less detailed information,
however, is available on disaggregated fixed income securities and related derivatives
positions. Finally, lack of information sharing on credit histories between department stores
and banks prevents a full assessment of the creditworthiness of individuals.
35.
Supervisors are currently assessing private sector dynamic loan loss provision
models. The SBIF has started a joint study with banks to assess their dynamic provisioning
practices and/or proposals. The assessment could be further strengthened by using a
regulatory benchmark model and common regulatory scenarios.
36.
The new proposed capital markets reform law MKB aims to further strengthen
the prudential and supervisory framework. MKB contemplates the adoption of best
supervisory practices including policies to reduce credit procyclicality and limit the risks of
individual institutions. MKB also contemplates a substantial update of the institutional
supervisory framework to broaden the autonomy of the supervisory agencies and facilitate
the resolution mechanism for failed institutions. The update includes changing the structure
of the SVS to a securities and insurance commission (CVS) composed by two independent
bodies, one on charge of regulation and supervision and the second one of enforcement, in
order to ensure independence and accountability. The senior officers in the commission
would be designated by the President from a roster proposed by the Council of Public
Administration. The authorities are also exploring changes to the corporate governance
structure of the SBIF geared towards enhancing its autonomy and independence.

37
ANNEX 3. CHILE—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Chile’s external debt is relatively low (Figure A1). Total external debt increased to
45 percent in 2009 from 38 percent in 2008. Debt levels are not very sensitive to growth or
interest-rate shocks, but are somewhat sensitive to a depreciation of the peso, as nearly all of
Chile’s external debt is denominated in foreign currency.
Chile remained a net public creditor in 2009. Net public sector assets decreased to
11.2 percent of GDP in 2009, and gross central government debt remained low at 9 percent
of GDP (Figure A2).

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
September 29, 2010

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2010 Article IV Consultation with Chile
On September 13, 2010 the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Chile.1
Background
Chile’s economy has withstood successfully two consecutive large negative shocks—the
global financial crisis and the February 2010 earthquake. Its resilience has been underpinned
by substantial macroeconomic easing, a well-capitalized banking system, and absence of
imbalances in the private sector. Strong growth has resumed since the second half of 2009,
and the earthquake caused only a temporary disruption in economic activity. The
unemployment rate has declined and annual Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation increased to
2.2 percent in July.
The financial system has weathered the crisis well and the cyclical deterioration of credit
quality has been moderate. Non-performing loans remain relatively low at 3 percent of all
loans. Banks are well capitalized and have a relatively stable domestic funding base.
Financing conditions have eased since the second half of 2010 and credit growth has
resumed. As liquidity conditions normalized, the central bank has unwound unconventional

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
policy measures implemented during the crisis. The temporary short-term bank liquidity facility
was terminated in mid-June 2010, and the policy rate has been raised to 2 percent by August.
Large fiscal savings accumulated over the past decade allowed the authorities to put in place a
substantial fiscal stimulus in 2009, followed by an ambitious earthquake reconstruction
program, while preserving trust in the soundness of public finances. The overall fiscal balance
shifted to a deficit of 4.4 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2009. The structural
fiscal deficit is expected to remain high in 2010 due to reconstruction spending. Nonetheless,
fiscal credibility remains strong. Moody’s raised Chile’s government debt rating to Aa3 in June,
and the recent turbulence in Europe has had little impact on risk premia.
Looking ahead, the economic recovery is expected to continue. GDP is expected to grow by
5 percent in 2010, accelerating to 6 percent in 2011. Large scale private and public
reconstruction spending should continue to boost growth. At the same time, net exports are
likely to weaken further, as some of the domestic demand growth spills over to imports. CPI
inflation is expected to exceed the 3-percent target by the end of 2010, before coming down
gradually in 2011, as the effect of interest rate increases filters through.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities’ skillful responses to the global financial crisis
and to the devastating earthquake of last February, capitalizing on Chile’s robust policy
framework. As a result, the economy is back on track for a sustainable recovery. Directors
viewed the authorities’ decision to accommodate relief and reconstruction spending through a
combination of tax and expenditure measures, and some debt issuance, as timely and
prudent. Looking ahead, the government’s commitment to firm expenditure restraint starting
in 2011 will anchor expectations, help reduce the risk of overheating and limit appreciation
pressures.
Directors supported the authorities’ target of lowering the structural deficit of the central
government to 1 percent of GDP by 2014. Returning to a zero structural balance over a longer
horizon would be desirable. Directors also encouraged the government to renew its
commitment to fully recapitalize the central bank.
Directors welcomed the government’s decision to review the fiscal rule. While Chile’s fiscal
rule has served the country well in the last decade, it could be made even more effective by
making it more transparent; introducing an explicit escape clause and features to limit
spending procyclicality; and complementing it with an explicit medium-term policy framework
that extends beyond the government’s term. Directors encouraged the government to outline a
clear timetable for adopting any revisions to the rule, once the fiscal rule commission has
issued its final report.

3
Directors supported the gradual tightening of the monetary policy currently underway. They
recognized the risk that widening interest rate and growth differentials with major advanced
economies could result in a surge in capital inflows, and agreed with the central bank’s
approach to let exchange rate flexibility be the first line of defense. In addition, macroprudential
measures could be useful to protect domestic balance sheets and prevent excessive growth in
credit.
Directors noted that Chile’s financial sector is sound and has weathered the crisis well. They
welcomed the authorities’ intentions to enhance the supervision of the financial sector,
including the planned move towards consolidated supervision of financial conglomerates. They
recommended continued strengthening of the prudential framework by adopting a functional
approach to regulation and supervision; formalizing cooperation arrangements among the
supervisory agencies; and strengthening cross-border coordination with international
counterparts.
Directors supported the government’s initiatives to reduce the cost of doing business by
facilitating the entry of new firms, making credit more accessible to small and medium
enterprises, and reforming the corporate bankruptcy procedures. Increasing labor market
efficiency should be another key objective.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The staff report (use the free Adobe Acrobat

Mr. Miguel Ricaurte, Advisor to the Executive Director
September 13, 2010
1.
Our authorities would like to thank the staff for the Staff Report and Selected Issues
papers and for the thorough discussions on the recovery process from the international crisis
and the earthquake which occurred on February 27 of this year, as well as on the policy
responses implemented to deal with these events. Such discussions reflect the permanent
dialogue between the Chilean authorities and the Fund staff on policy issues which has
characterized the relationship between Chile and the Fund. In early 2010, more dynamic
activity and receding unemployment meant the Chilean economy was on a recovery path
from the global downturn of the last quarter of 2008. This was achieved thanks to the
significant policy stimulus, made possible by the credible fiscal and monetary frameworks,
and incipient world recovery. However, a significant earthquake that destroyed infrastructure
and disrupted productive activities altered short term prospects. The new administration acted
decisively and assumed a leadership role in the reconstruction process. The costs associated
with this unexpected natural disaster meant that envisaged fiscal structural balance goals had
to be revised. Our authorities are committed to taking advantage of these challenges to push
for pro-efficiency reforms in terms of government management and labor and financial
market functioning, as well as improving the structural balance rule seeking to achieve more
transparency. The final goal is to attain higher potential output growth, keeping price and
financial stability always in sight.
The Global Crisis and the Earthquake
2.
The degree of financial and commercial integration of Chile meant the global crisis
took a large toll on the economy. Starting in the fourth quarter of 2008, output growth slowed
and became negative. For eleven months following December 2008, economic activity
contracted, reaching its worst point in April 2009, when the 12-month growth rate of the
economic activity index was -4.9 percent. Accordingly, unemployment, measured by the new
employment survey, rose to a maximum of 11.6 percent in the June-August quarter, while
employment contracted 1.9 percent between the January-March and May-July quarters.
Moreover, inflation rapidly decelerated during 2009, showing negative y-o-y growth during
the last five months of the year, with the largest drop of 2.3 percent registered in November.
In response to the impact of the global crisis, our authorities undertook significant monetary,
fiscal, and pro-credit policies in order to mitigate the impact of the global downturn as much
as possible.
3.
As a result of these policies, as well as the incipient improvement in international
conditions towards the end of 2009, the economy began to recover, with output growing at
2.1 percent in the last quarter of 2009, as well as receding unemployment. In 2009, GDP
dropped by 1.5 percent (1.4, SA), compared to the 3.7 percent growth of 2008 (3.4, SA). An

2
inventory drawdown process and falling investment played important roles in the faltering of
the economy. Moreover, the prospects for recovery in 2010 looked promising as the indicator
of economic activity grew at an annual rate of 3.9 percent in January and unemployment
stood slightly above 9 percent, although prices continued to fall that month (headline
inflation was -1.3 and core inflation, -2.2 percent).
4.
Yet, on February 27, Chile was hit by an 8.8 Richter-scale earthquake and a
subsequent tsunami. With considerable damage to the south-center regions of the country important to the paper and pulp, oil refining, fishing, and iron and steel product industries private and public infrastructure destruction, and lives lost, short-term prospects took a heavy
blow. Production fell 2.3 percent in March and employment was affected, especially in the
regions most hardly hit by the earthquake. The Banco Central de Chile (BCC) estimated that
the earthquake destroyed 3 percent of the country’s capital stock, narrowing the output gap
generated during the global crisis. Our authorities took this challenge as an opportunity to
strengthen the country and its economy. The government’s share of the estimated US$30
billion cost of the reconstruction is anticipated to be US$8.4 billion (4 percent of GDP),
which will be implemented between 2010 and 2013. The reconstruction plan will be funded
by a temporary rise in taxes, improved expenditure efficiency and debt issuance. For this
purpose, Chile placed two bonds in international markets in very favorable conditions at the
end of last July. Since the earthquake, recovery has been stronger than expected. In the first
quarter of 2010, output grew 1.5 percent (1.4, SA), while the second quarter saw a 6.5
percent growth rate (6.5, SA); and the unemployment rate for the May-July quarter was 8.3
percent. In light of these developments, market expectations for output growth for 2010 have
increased, in line with the BCC’s current forecast of 5.0 to 5.5 percent.
5.
Consumer price inflation has begun to pick up after the rapid and steady decline of
2009 and the first half of 2010, in part due to mounting international pressures and the
closing of the output gap triggered by the earthquake. Headline inflation reached 2.6 percent
in August, whereas core inflation was 1.9 percent. Currently, CPI inflation is expected to
reach over 3 percent by the end of 2010, and to converge to 3 percent in 2011. In line with
these developments, the BCC revised upward its y-o-y inflation forecast to 3.9 percent for
December 2010.
6.
In the midst of these changing economic conditions, a new administration took office
in March, facing extraordinary challenges in terms of economic policy. Our authorities
acknowledge that the responses in terms of monetary, fiscal, and credit policies started by the
previous administration were possible thanks to sound policy frameworks that allowed the
government to save resources needed not only to fund the fiscal stimulus and reconstruction
packages, but to add credibility to the incoming government programs. Nevertheless, the new
administration is aware that more needs to be done and, therefore, is working to introduce
significant reforms seeking to improve government, regulatory, and productive efficiency
and restore fiscal balance lost during the global crisis.

3
Monetary Policy
7.
Following the unraveling of the global crisis, the BCC aggressively decreased the
monetary policy rate 775 basis points in seven months, bringing it down to 0.5 percent in
July 2009. This was consistent with the view that a massive monetary stimulus was necessary
to attain the inflation target in the policy horizon. The BCC indicated that 0.5 was the lower
bound rate and complementary funding measures were adopted in order for the market to
incorporate the BCC’s stance into their expectations. Once the economy showed signals of
recovery, the BCC board announced in the November 2009 Monetary Policy Meeting
communiqué that the term funding facility would be phased-out by May 2010, and that the
policy rate would be kept at its minimum at least up to the second quarter of 2010.
8.
The policy rate was left unchanged at 0.5 percent until May. The BCC considered that
the short-term impact of the earthquake was larger than initially assessed and inflation
remained subdued. However, new information showed that the earthquake had a very
transient impact on the economy, which began to recover rapidly. Since June, the monetary
policy rate has been hiked by 50 basis points each time, currently standing at 2.0 percent.
Although headline inflation rose in July, the BCC authorities highlight transitory shocks as
the sources behind this surge, while underlying measures remain contained. Although there is
higher uncertainty regarding the international environment as recovery of developed
economies has not materialized in a definite manner, the outlook for Chile remains favorable.
Therefore, the BCC authorities informed in the September monetary policy report that the
monetary stimulus would continue to be withdrawn at a pace that depends on the evolution of
internal and external macroeconomic conditions. Private sector expectations are consistent
with this stance.
9.
While the nominal exchange rate has fluctuated due to market developments, the real
exchange rate broadly remains aligned with its long-term fundamentals. Our authorities are
committed to maintaining the flexible exchange rate regime in place since late 1999.
Nevertheless, this framework does not preclude intervention during extraordinary
circumstances.
Fiscal Policy and Productivity-Oriented Reforms
10.
The government's fiscal position deteriorated as the country faced the global crisis
and the earthquake. The new administration is not only committed to improving fiscal
accounts, but has the goal of increasing the efficiency of the government apparatus which,
alongside other labor market and financial reforms, will contribute to enhancing Chile's
potential growth rate over the next four years.
11.
The structural budget rule and the Fiscal Responsibility Law resulted in the Chilean
government saving the windfall gains in the copper price surpluses during the commodity
price boom into the two Sovereign Wealth Funds: the Pension Reserve Fund and the
Economic and Social Stabilization Fund (ESSF), the latter of which had accumulated US$

4
20.2 billion as of December 2008. The ESSF served the country well when resources were
needed during the global crisis to fund the countercyclical policy responses involving a
Fiscal Stimulus Plan to support economic activity and employment; a Pro-Credit Plan to
secure the flow of credit to businesses and individuals in the lower phase of the economic
cycle; and the Pro-employment Employment Accord to mitigate the impact of the cycle on
employment. The Fiscal Stimulus Plan was announced in early January 2009, with a size
equivalent to 2.4 percent of GDP (US$4 billion). As additional resources were needed,
withdrawals from the ESSF continued to be made amounting to a total of US$9.3 billion in
2009. By the end of the year, public expenditure had grown 18.2 percent in real terms,
surpassing initial estimates.
12.
In 2010 the real growth rate of government expenditure is expected to decrease to 9
percent. To finance government expenditure, our authorities sent a comprehensive funding
package to Congress which included temporary tax increases, redirecting the share of
government-owned Codelco revenues intended for the armed forces towards the central
government's budget, and a proposed increase in the mining royalty regime to take advantage
of currently high commodity prices. All measures, except the royalty to the mining sector,
were approved by Congress and the authorities had to look for alternative sources of funding,
including an alternative royalty scheme reform recently sent to Congress. In late July, Chile
issued two bonds, one denominated in US dollars and another linked to pesos in the
international markets. Both were heavily overwritten, reflecting the positive position Chile
has in international markets in spite of the tough conditions it has faced in the last two years.
The US$1 billion dollar bond paid a 90 basis points premium, the best conditions an
emerging market has been able to achieve under similar circumstances. The peso-linked bond
of US$500 million was issued at a 5.5 percent interest rate.
13.
One of our authorities' main goals is to return to structural balance once the fiscal
stimulus package and reconstruction spending are phased out. This requires resetting a clear
structural balance goal. Our authorities acknowledge the fact that the fiscal rule applied in
Chile between 2001 and 2008 proved to be a fundamental pillar of the existing
macroeconomic framework to secure domestic and external stability. However, the rule did
not allow for the type and magnitude of counter-cyclical policies needed in 2009 to deal with
the global crisis. The authorities’ plan originally contemplated a reduction, on a temporary
basis, in the structural surplus target from 0.5 to 0 percent of GDP, which finally became a
1.2 structural deficit as the conditions warranted a larger fiscal stimulus. In response to this
event, the current administration is seeking to perfect the rule in order to deal with
exceptional situations, keeping in mind it is a key instrument for macroeconomic stability.
For this purpose, a Committee of Advisors on the Structural Balance Rule was assembled.
14.
The Committee will give a final report containing specific recommendations on the
structure of the rule, as well as its governing legal framework later in the year. However, in
mid-August, it presented a preliminary report, which evaluates the current stance and
provides guidance for the 2011 budget. In general terms, the Committee recommended using

5
the rule as it currently stands for next year's budget, but suggested: (1) reversing the
correction for transitory tax measures; reversing the cyclical adjustment of (2) the "other
income" account and (3) the interest earned on the treasury's financial assets; and (4) reestimating the elasticity of health insurance contributions. Applying the revised methodology
to historical data results in larger structural deficits as percentage of GDP for 2008 (-0.6 vs.
0.0) and 2009 (-3.1 vs. -1.2). Since the authorities have adopted the Committee's preliminary
methodology for the 2011 budget, they have revised the outlook to a 3.2 percent deficit for
2010 and to a 1 percent structural deficit target (instead of structural balance) for 2014. Our
authorities want to stress the fact that underlying conditions have not changed, but rather,
these modifications clarify what constitutes expenditures and income under a neutral stance
of GDP with the goal of improving transparency on the structural balance situation of Chile.
15.
Beyond mere expenditure control measures, the authorities are seeking to gain
efficiency in the state apparatus by improving institutional governance, as well optimizing
expenditure. Currently, government programs are being audited in order to identify their
social returns so that resources can be aimed at those from which society benefits the most.
Additional gains are sought from labor legislation reforms aimed at making the labor market
more flexible, favoring indefinite versus fix-term contracts, as well as labor force
participation. Our authorities expect to favor training and human capital accumulation under
indefinite contracts, once large firing costs are substituted by a more comprehensive
unemployment insurance scheme. Moreover, pro-investment policies seeking to favor smalland medium-size enterprises, along with the above mentioned reforms, are expected to yield
an additional 1 percentage point to potential GDP growth rate. All in all, it is this
administration's goal to attain a 6 percent potential growth rate for Chile.
Financial Sector
16.
Chile’s sound regulatory framework has proven to be fundamental in securing the
stability of the financial system, and therefore insulating the domestic market from the global
turmoil. The financial sector performed well during the crisis, with banks capitalization
remaining well above minimum regulatory requirements. The financial sector has also
proven resilient to the earthquake and the recent period of financial turmoil triggered by
events in Europe. The most recent bank lending conditions survey shows that banks are
easing credit conditions – which is consistent with the recent recovery in credit growth.
17.
Our authorities are committed to further enhancing the financial regulatory
framework. The most recent financial market reform approved, the MKIII, broadens the
range of authorized financial instruments, facilitates securitization, improves conditions for
foreign institutional investors and expands the set of long-term financing alternatives for
banks. Moreover, the current administration is working on a comprehensive reform agenda,
denominated the Bicentennial Capital Markets reform, or MKB, which would further
improve market liquidity, update corporate governance of supervisors, improve information
sharing and, ultimately, move towards a comprehensive reform of the supervision scheme.

6
Progress has also been made in strengthening the supervision of financial conglomerates. The
first steps were taken in June 2009 when a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was
signed by the members of the Committee of Superintendents (which includes the banking,
pensions and securities supervisors), in order to formalize the cooperation and coordination
channels between them. This committee is currently conducting a pilot oversight project for
conglomerates, under a lead supervisor model. Additionally, the strengthening of the
consumer protection agency’s role in financial products is under discussion in Congress.
Finally, concrete steps have been taken to strengthen securities clearing and settlement
infrastructure.
Conclusion
18.
Following the effect of global crisis on Chile’s economy, a comprehensive stimulus
package was put forward to minimize its adverse effect, financed with resources saved during
the commodity price boom. Chile’s economy had begun to recover when the February 27
earthquake hit the country. Nevertheless, the new administration took a decisive stance to use
these challenges as opportunities to push for significant reforms aimed at reconstructing lost
infrastructure, restoring fiscal balance and, ultimately, attaining higher potential output
growth for Chile. Funding for reconstruction will come from, among other sources,
temporary increases in taxes and borrowing. Moreover, learning from the last crisis, the
authorities are seeking to enhance the fiscal balance rule to cope with extreme situations as
the one lived in 2009 as well as improving the transparency of fiscal balance goals. Chile is
currently on a solid recovery path, with output growing at healthy rates and decreasing
unemployment. Our country’s strong institutions and policy frameworks have been
instrumental in the process of becoming a member of the OECD, which culminated in May
of 2010 with the accession to the organization as an official member.
