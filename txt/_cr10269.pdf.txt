EXECUTIVE SUMMARY


The global crisis has negatively impacted Namibia, reversing years of strong
economic performance and deteriorating the fiscal and external positions. Robust
economic growth, underpinned by a strong mining sector and sound macroeconomic
policies, gave way to a contraction in output as external demand for minerals fell.
Government revenue–to–GDP ratio declined, while expenditure levels were increased
to address the impact of global crisis, resulting in a fiscal deficit in 2009 after three
consecutive years of fiscal surpluses. Despite a deterioration of the external position,
the level of international reserves remained high partly thanks to the allocation of
SDRs that helped mitigate the impact of the decline in export earnings. Growth is
expected to recover gradually over the medium term as the global economy
strengthens and private investment in the mining sector firms up, but downside risks
remain.



Stimulus measures in 2009/10 and the expansionary stance in the 2010/11 budget
contributed to a deterioration in the fiscal outlook. The countercyclical policy
stance has helped cushion the impact of the global crisis. However, fiscal deficits
over 8 percent of GDP are projected for 2010/11 and 2011/12, leading to a rapid
accumulation of public debt.



Accordingly, the authorities have committed to undertake fiscal consolidation
with a view to reducing the fiscal deficit to 2.6 percent of GDP by 2014. In this
connection they are considering measures to strengthen non-SACU revenue and
reducing total expenditures to pre-crisis levels while reorienting spending to quality
capital projects and critical social programs. The authorities also intend to strengthen
public financial management and further improve the budget process.



Staff underscored the need for an earlier withdrawal of the stimulus measures
and a more ambitious fiscal consolidation than envisaged by the authorities in the
baseline scenario to provide room to respond to adverse shocks going forward. Staff
also called for streamlining fiscal rules with the debt-to-GDP ratio as a key anchor to
be complemented with a target on the non-SACU fiscal balance to help isolate fiscal
policy from volatile SACU revenues.



The financial sector weathered the global financial crisis relatively well.
Commercial banks are profitable and continue to benefit from effective supervision
by the Bank of Namibia. However, there are weaknesses in the supervision of
nonbank financial institutions, which the authorities are taking steps to address,
notably through strengthening of the Namibia Financial Institutions Supervisory
Authority.



Growth potential needs to be increased. Efforts should focus on reducing the
continuing high cost of doing business, and improving the environment for private
sector-led growth.

mineral exports, favorable terms of trade, and increasing SACU transfers. However,
significant capital outflows—mostly through pension funds—dampened the accumulation of
international reserves, which rose slightly to US$1.4 billion at end-2008 (3.8 months of
imports).
II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS: ENDURING THE GLOBAL CRISIS
3.

The global crisis adversely affected Namibia’s macroeconomic performance:


Output contracted in 2009 as external demand for the country’s main
exports collapsed. Real GDP is estimated to have decreased by 0.8 percent in
2009, from a 4.3 percent growth in 2008 driven by a sharp decline in mineral

5


production. Diamond production halved in 2009, while the copper company
suspended operations in late 2008 in response to sharply lower prices.
Inflation started to moderate as food and fuel prices eased, and the
strengthening in the South African rand, to which the Namibian dollar is
pegged at par, is passed through to domestic prices. The twelve-month
inflation rate stood at 5 percent in April 2010, compared to 10 percent a year
earlier.
Box 1. Social Indicators

Despite the strong macroeconomic performance, Namibia’s key social indicators
remain weak. Progress is being made towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs) by 2015, but poverty is widespread. Income inequality has eased slightly, but
remains among the highest in the world. Lack of job opportunities and a skills mismatch in
the nonmining sector have led to high structural unemployment with the rate estimated
between 35 to 50 percent. The relatively high prevalence of HIV/AIDS is another key
challenge confronting the country as it is undermining the country’s productive capacity, and
contributing to the weak social indicators.



The fiscal position shifted into a deficit in 2009/10. Government revenue fell
by 2.3 percentage points of GDP reflecting a drop in mineral revenue and
lower SACU transfers as South Africa’s economy contracted. This, combined
with a ramp up in expenditures, led to a shift of the fiscal balance into a deficit
of 2.8 percent of GDP in 2009/10 from a surplus of 2 percent in 2008/09.



The external current account position also deteriorated. In 2009, the current
account balance is estimated to have shifted into a deficit of 1.8 percent of
GDP from a 2.7 percent surplus in 2008 because mining exports fell, and
imports increased on the back of an appreciation of the South African rand
and a pickup in construction activities related to mining projects. In addition,
foreign direct investment (FDI) slowed down owing to the downturn in the
mining sector, while compliance with domestic investment requirements
curtailed capital outflows. Gross international reserves remained relatively
unchanged at US$1.4 billion (3.4 months of imports) thanks to the allocation
of SDRs1 that helped mitigate the impact of the decline in export earnings.

III. SHORT-TERM MACROECONOMIC POLICIES: RESPONDING TO THE CRISIS
4.
The authorities used the available fiscal space for countercyclical policies. The
2009/10 budget combined tax relief for non mining companies and households (1 percentage
point of GDP) and expenditure increases, including spending on infrastructures and social
programs (0.9 percentage points of GDP) to offset the decline in external demand. The
authorities also granted wage increases to the civil service (0.9 percentage points of GDP).
These measures helped sustain activities in construction, manufacturing and services sectors,
which partially offset contraction in the mining sector. Given uncertainties about the strength
of the global recovery and a time when the output is still below its potential (Box 2), the
authorities have decided to maintain an expansionary fiscal stance in the 2010/11 budget,
which implies a non-SACU fiscal deficit of 14.8 percent of GDP, up from 13.3 percent of
GDP in 2009/10, and an increase in the public debt-to-GDP ratio to 19.6 percent, up from
14.9 percent (¶ 9).
5.
Monetary easing in the anchor country enabled the Bank of Namibia (BoN) to
pursue an accommodative policy stance. Since the end of 2008, the BoN cut its policy rate
by 300 basis points to 7 percent in June 2009 in line with the monetary policy stance of the
South African Reserve Bank (SARB). Growth of credit to the private sector remained

In the wake of the global crisis, the IMF approved a general allocation of Special Drawing Rights (SDRs)
equivalent to US$250 billion (SDR 161 billion) and a special one-time allocation of SDR 21.5 billion. Namibia
received a total amount of SDR 130.4 million (US$203.4 million at end-August 2009 exchange rate), which
was saved.

8
subdued at 10 percent in 2009, well below its pre-crisis level, as banks tightened their
lending conditions.
Box 2. Estimating Potential Output for Namibia
Estimates of the potential output using the Hodrick-Prescott (HP) filter indicate an
output gap in 2010. The results suggest that between 2004 and 2008, buoyant growth in the
mining and service sectors pushed the real output above its potential. However, growth
contraction in 2009 following the global economic downturn has led to a negative output
gap,1 estimated at 2.5 percent of GDP. While the economy is projected to grow close to its
potential rate in 2010, this will still leave barely unchanged the output gap resulting from the
slack in economic activity in 2009. Eliminating this gap would require a growth rate of
5.9 percent in 2010. It is worth noting that estimations of the output gap for Namibia is
complicated by a number of factors, particularly short time series and some weaknesses in
national account data.

IV. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
6.
Against the backdrop of a challenging global environment, the discussions
focused on how and when to exit from the current expansionary stance of fiscal policy to
preserve fiscal sustainability over the medium term in the face of the significant drop in
SACU revenue, while managing risks, and maintaining external and financial stability.
A. Outlook and Risks
7.
The near-term and medium-term growth outlooks are positive. In the near term,
growth would benefit from the stimulus measures and a gradual recovery in the external
demand for Namibia’s exports, particularly diamond. Over the medium term, real GDP

9
growth is predicated on a strong recovery in private investment in the mining sector. Mining
of uranium is expected to be the key driver with the commissioning of at least three new
mines in the medium term. The improved outlook for world demand for uranium is
sustaining inflows of FDI, with a positive impact on the balance of payments over the
medium term. Diamond exports, which for a long time helped to sustain economic growth,
are also expected to rebound although not to their pre-2008 levels.
8.
However, downside risks remain. The authorities recognized that a weakening of
the global economic recovery or worse, another dip, could dampen activity within the
mineral sector by impacting negatively on commodity prices, with implications for the
overall economy.2 In addition, delays in the thawing of financial markets may adversely
affect FDI inflows and hinder the recovery in private investment. On the fiscal front, customs
and mineral-related taxes, accounting for just under half of total revenue, will continue to be
affected by growth prospects in South Africa and external demand for mineral exports.
Further downside risks to SACU revenue stem from the possibility of a revision to the
revenue sharing formula and the possible expansion of SACU to include additional countries,
even though the authorities noted that new members with larger economies may also bring
more resources to the revenue pool. Finally, failure to carry through the fiscal consolidation
plan could put at risk internal and external sustainability.
B. Unwinding Fiscal Stimulus and Managing Fiscal Risks
9.
The authorities recognized that the countercyclical stance contributed to
deteriorate the fiscal outlook. With SACU revenue anticipated to drop from 10.5 percent of
GDP in 2009/10 to only 2.8 percent

government securities would help in the financing of the emerging deficits. While trending

Recent events in Europe have heightened the risks of a double-dip recession.

In addition to the reduction in the size of the SACU revenue pool, Namibia is to repay excess SACU transfers

public debt, which would nearly double by 2013/14 (29.1 percent of GDP). Inclusion of
publicly-guaranteed debt will push the debt-to-GDP ratio to over 30 percent by 2012/13.
10.
The authorities are aware of the need for a timely unwinding of the fiscal
stimulus and to undertake fiscal consolidation to preserve fiscal sustainability over the
medium term. They indicated that the 2010/11–2012/13 Medium-Term Expenditure
Framework (MTEF) envisages a sharp reduction in expenditure in 2011/12–2012/13
(4.9 percentage points of GDP) with a view to bringing government expenditure to
28 percent of GDP by 2012/13. Moreover, the authorities are considering measures to
strengthen non-SACU revenue, including improving value added tax (VAT) compliance and
tax audits, expanding the mineral tax to all minerals and introducing an environmental levy.
To this end, they have requested technical assistance (TA) from the Fund to conduct a broad
review of tax policy.
11.
The authorities are committed to keep the public debt level within the target of
30 percent of GDP. With the onset of the global financial and economic crisis, the
authorities decided to raise the public debt-to-GDP ratio from 25 percent to a range of 25–
30 percent. On current policies, the debt sustainability analysis (DSA) shows that the level of
public debt is sustainable,4 but could escalate if a negative growth shock occurs or contingent
liabilities materialize, including losses by some state-owned enterprises (SOEs), borrowing
by local government, and possible liabilities from envisaged Public-Private Partnerships
(PPPs).
12.
The authorities are convinced that strengthening public financial management
and the budget process are also needed to improve fiscal outcomes. In line with the
recommendations of Fund technical assistance, they have taken steps to move to program
budgeting. A new chart of account is being finalized, and four pilot line ministries have been
identified to roll out program budgeting with all ministries expected to complete the process
by 2011/12. While aware of the need to address the fragmentation of the responsibilities for
compilation of current and capital budgets to further strengthen the budget process, the
authorities pointed to legislative hurdles that may take time to overcome.
13.
Staff underscored the need for deficit reduction starting from 2011/12, and for a
more ambitious fiscal consolidation over the medium term. Staff also emphasized the
importance of reorienting stimulus spending in favor of capital projects and improving the
quality of public expenditures in general. Given the public debt outlook, staff proposed an
alternative scenario (Box 3) that would bring the fiscal deficit to near balance, and the public
and publicly-guaranteed debt to 27.2 percent of GDP by 2014/15, thereby providing room to
respond to adverse shocks going forward. There is also a need to streamline overlapping

11
fiscal rules to provide clearer guidance for fiscal policy.5 In this regard, the debt-to-GDP ratio
should be the key anchor for fiscal policy since it captures better on and off-balance sheet
items. Setting a target on non-SACU fiscal balance would also help isolate fiscal policy from
volatile SACU revenues.
Box 3. Alternative Fiscal Scenario
Staff is of the view that a more ambitious fiscal consolidation centered on expenditure
reforms and revenue enhancement should continue through 2014/15. Compared to the
baseline scenario, fiscal consolidation under the alternative scenario would start with an
overall budget deficit reduction a year earlier in 2011/12. Expenditure measures should aim
at gradually reducing

of SOEs. The authorities also need to contain the wage bill within budgeted levels.1 Increased
non-SACU revenue mobilization is also critical to fiscal consolidation efforts. Already,
revenue administration has been strengthened through the introduction of comprehensive
auditing of VAT refunds and the plan to expand mineral tax to all minerals is a welcome
step, but additional measures are required including streamlining tax exemptions, and
implementing an integrated tax system to further raise revenue. Creation of a large taxpayer
unit would help focus limited resources on large taxpayers.

The fiscal consolidation plan envisaged in the current MTEF could only be achieved if the projected increases
in the wage bill (3 and 7 percent in 2011/12 and 2012/13, respectively) are not exceeded; these are below the
16.3 percent average increase in 2008–11.

5
To guide fiscal policy over the period of the medium-term expenditure framework —MTEF (2010/11–
2012/13), the authorities adopted the following fiscal rules: (i) a public debt-to-GDP ratio of 25–30 percent
annually; (ii) an average budget deficit of 5 percent of GDP; (iii) public expenditure levels below 30 percent of
GDP; (iv) interest payments capped at 10 percent of government revenue; and (v) contingent liabilities below
10 percent of GDP annually.

12
14.
Fiscal risks need to be addressed. The authorities acknowledged the importance of
fiscal risks and the need to take appropriate measures to mitigate their impact (Box 4). They
pointed out the budget documents submitted to parliament already clearly identify fiscal
risks, though more could be done. They indicated that steps have been taken to address those
risks stemming from contingent liabilities by subjecting SOEs to performance agreement,
and moving away from blanket subsidies with a view to strengthening their performance. The
authorities are prepared to work with the IMF and other development partners to refine the
budget process and adopt best practices with regard to disclosure and management of fiscal
risks. In this regard, they have requested technical assistance, notably from the
Commonwealth.

Box 4. Fiscal Risks in Namibia1
Fiscal risk is defined as the possibility of deviations of fiscal outcomes, including
government expenditures, revenues, assets, and liabilities, compared to the expectations at
the time of the budget preparation. Deviations can be on the upside, when government fiscal
balance and public debt are better than envisaged in the budget or on the downside when
fiscal outcomes worsen.
Assessment of various sources of fiscal risks suggests that shortfalls in SACU revenue and
economic growth are the main sources of fiscal risks in Namibia. After stripping out the
impact of anticipated changes in SACU revenue, economic growth, interest rates, terms of
trade, and inflation from the deviations of fiscal balance and public debt, there remains a
large unexplained residual, which may reflect the importance of contingent liabilities and
forecasting errors.
Adopting fiscal rules based on a sustainable non-SACU fiscal balance, and strengthening the
budget framework and processes could contribute to mitigate fiscal risks. Moreover, budgets
should be based on reasonable growth assumptions and alternative scenarios on key
assumptions should be considered. Further, improving disclosure of fiscal risks, especially
contingent liabilities, could help promote appropriate contingency responses should they
materialize.

and Swaziland co-authored by T. Fontaine, K. Kpodar, and N. Toé.

C. Preserving External Stability and Competitiveness
15.
The authorities consider the peg to the South African rand as the best option for
Namibia given the historic and economic linkages. They indicated that the peg does not
only enhance trade between the two countries, but has also resulted in Namibia having
relatively low rates of inflation.
16.
Staff estimates under the baseline scenario indicate that Namibia’s real effective
exchange rate (REER) is broadly in line with fundamentals (Box 5). Despite a 10 percent
real appreciation in 2009 owing to the strengthening of the rand, the REER assessment
suggests a negligible overvaluation of the Namibian dollar provided that the authorities’
fiscal consolidation under the baseline scenario takes place. The authorities believe that
effective fiscal consolidation and implementation of structural reforms are critical to foster
external stability, improve competitiveness, and increase confidence in the viability of the
monetary arrangement. Indeed, the envisaged fiscal consolidation by the authorities would
contribute to bring down the external current account deficit to 1.9 percent by 2014, which
will peak at 5.7 percent in 2011.

Box 5. Assessment of the Equilibrium Real Effective Exchange Rate
The assessment of Namibia’s REER using the three CGER methodologies suggests a
negligible overvaluation of the Namibian dollar under the baseline scenario. With the
macroeconomic balance approach, the

when real output will be close to its potential
(see Box 2), which leads to an overvaluation
of 5.9 percent.1 Also, the findings of the

overvaluation of 4.7 percent, with the current

foreign assets being estimated at a surplus of
1.3 percent of GDP in 2014. Finally, the equilibrium REER approach yields similar results,
with the overvaluation estimated a 1.6 percent based on a model that explains changes in the
REER by trade openness, investment rate, broad money and relative productivity against
main trading partners.2

Improving the business environment is essential to stimulate growth and foster
higher employment opportunities. Namibia’s main challenge is creating the conditions to
attract and sustain FDI, particularly in the non mining sector. While recognizing that the
country’s main strengths lie in its strong institutions, staff noted that labor skill shortages
combined with delays in processing work permits, high cost of transport and energy
shortages, complicated business registration and licensing procedures, continue to undermine
firms’ productivity and weaken FDI inflows. Reducing the continuing high cost of doing
business, and creating an enabling environment for private sector-led growth are all critical
for improving Namibia’s competitiveness.

D. Monetary and Financial Stability Issues
18.
As a member of the Common Monetary Area, monetary policy of the BoN tracks
closely that of SARB. Nevertheless, the BoN decided to maintain its repo rate at 7 percent in
April and June 2010, despite the fact that SARB cut its rate by 50 basis points to 6.5 percent
in March 2010. The BoN felt that a further reduction in the policy rate was not necessary at
present as the effects of the previous interest cuts are yet to be fully passed through given the
lag in monetary policy transmission.
19.
The financial sector weathered relatively well the global financial crisis. The
commercial banks, most of which are South African subsidiaries, have been conservative in
their lending practices and have had little direct overseas exposure. They tend to be well
provisioned and profitable and continue to benefit from prudent supervision by the BoN.
However, there has been a sizeable contraction in lending to the private sector from the
banking system, which could further limit private sector development.

20.
The authorities have taken measures to address vulnerability stemming from
weaknesses in the supervision of the rapidly growing nonbank financial institutions
(NBFIs).6 These include efforts to improve supervision through the strengthening of the
Namibia Financial Institutions Supervisory Authority (NAMFISA), but capacity constraints
remain. In this regard, the authorities are looking to enhance human capacity within the
organization and have formally requested IMF TA in the area of supervision. Further, the
Financial Institutions and Markets Bill has been approved by Cabinet and is set to be tabled
in Parliament by the end of 2010. Passage of this bill will help to further strengthen
NAMFISA in carrying out its obligations.
21.
The authorities are aware that careful consideration should be given to the
modifications to the domestic investment requirements for insurance companies and
pension funds. The amendment, which was put in place in 2009 and is envisaged to be
phased-in over a five-year period, limits dual-listed companies to a maximum of 10 percent
of local assets and requires a minimum of 1.75 percent of total assets to be invested in
unlisted Namibian companies. Given the limited size of the domestic market, the repatriation
requirement could encourage risk taking by these institutions and may force them to forgo
higher yield investments abroad, thus lowering their profitability. The authorities stressed
their commitment to safeguarding the long-term financial viability of the pension funds and
insurance companies, but indicated that the domestic investment requirement has stemmed
capital outflows, and contributed to the development of local capital markets.
E. Promoting Broad-Based Growth and Poverty Reduction
22.
The recent global downturn has highlighted the need for a comprehensive
strategy to spur broad based growth in Namibia. The country’s heavy reliance on the
mining sector makes it highly vulnerable to commodity price shocks. The economic
contraction last year, following more than a decade of uninterrupted growth, has heightened
the need for a more broad-based growth strategy. While tapping the potential of the mining
sector, it is critical to unlock growth potential in agriculture, manufacturing and services,
particularly tourism, through reducing the cost of doing business, improving access to credit,
and attracting FDI. Structural reforms to improve the business climate and policies to address
infrastructure bottlenecks would contribute to the development of the nonmining sector, and
help make a dent in widespread unemployment. The authorities reiterated their commitment
to reducing the cost of doing business by investing heavily in infrastructure, roads, port
facilities, and power grid extension.

The NBFIs comprise mainly pension funds, insurance companies, unit trusts, stock brokers, asset managers,
and micro-lenders.

Prioritization in the execution of the National Development Plan 3 (NDP3)
(2007/08–2011/12) is needed. The recent global downturn has negatively impacted the
Namibian economy and set back the government’s efforts at achieving the NDP3 goals.
Renewed efforts and prioritization in the execution of that plan are therefore needed. In this
regard, the authorities noted that the MTEF (2010/11–2012/13) will devote about 45 percent
of government expenditures per annum over the next three years to priority sectors such as
education, health and agriculture, while improving the social safety net to alleviate poverty
and inequality. However, low productivity and limited implementation of structural reforms
will need to be overcome to foster steady growth.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
24.
The economic recovery is well underway, supported by timely macroeconomic
stimulus. However, the outlook is subject to downside risks stemming from uncertain global
economic recovery calling for coordination in the policy mix going forward. In particular, if
external demand for commodities weakens, and the thawing of financial markets is delayed,
the recovery could lose steam.
25.
The countercyclical measures have been instrumental in cushioning the impact
of the global downturn, but have deteriorated the fiscal outlook. The authorities
appropriately took advantage of the fiscal space available entering the crisis to stimulate the
economy. However, although an expansionary fiscal stance in 2010/11 appears appropriate
given the slack in economic activity and uncertainties about the global recovery, careful
attention should be paid to the quality of spending and efforts need to be made to reorient
spending in favor of quality capital projects while protecting critical social programs.
26.
A more ambitious fiscal consolidation than envisaged in the current MTEF is
key to ensuring internal and external sustainability. Fiscal consolidation should start from
2011/12 by targeting a reduction in the overall budget deficit so as to preserve
macroeconomic stability. Given the projected sharp drop in SACU revenue and rapid debt
accumulation in the medium term, the authorities need to step up efforts at reducing public
spending and mobilizing non-SACU revenue to reduce the projected fiscal deficits and public
debt to sustainable levels. In this context, containing the wage bill, accelerating the reforms
of SOEs, and improving non-SACU revenue mobilization should be accorded high priority.
27.
Fiscal risks need to be closely monitored. The measures being undertaken by the
authorities need to be complemented by reforms, including strengthening the budget process,
bringing into effect the SOEs Governance Act, and establishing the institutional and legal
framework for PPPs.
28.
The exchange rate peg to the rand continues to be the main anchor of monetary
policy. Despite the peg to the South African rand, the BoN monetary policy stance has
started since April 2010 to deviate from the interest rate policy of SARB. Staff believes that

20
there is a scope for reducing domestic interest rates by bringing the policy rate in line with
South Africa’s.
29.
Upgrading the supervision of NBFIs and addressing concerns about the
tightening of the regulation on domestic investment requirements for pension funds and
insurance companies are critical to ensure financial stability. Speeding up the approval of
the Financial Institutions and Markets Bill, and strengthening NAMFISA as an independent
body would go a long way in addressing weaknesses in prudential regulations and
supervision of the NBFIs. Regarding domestic investment requirement, short of reversing it
or reducing its rate, it is of paramount importance to monitor closely the impact on pension
funds with a view to mitigating risk taking by institutional investors and safeguard their longterm financial viability.
30.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the
standard 12-month cycle.

1/ "Overall balance" reflects externally financed project spending (except for roads) that is not channeled through the state account.
2/ "Overall balance excluding extrabudgetary spending" excludes such spending and thus corresponds directly with the authorities' concept.
3/ The change in domestic debt includes bonds issued for local capital market development.

When a member has overdue financial obligations outstanding for more than three months, the amount of
such arrears will be shown in this section.

VII.

Exchange rate arrangement

The Namibia dollar is pegged at par to the South African rand, and both currencies are legal
tender in Namibia. Namibia formally accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2(a),
3, and 4 of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement, as of September 20, 1996. While Namibia is
currently judged by the Fund to maintain an exchange system free of restrictions on the
making of payments and transfers for current international transactions, staff is in the process
of gathering information to make an assessment of whether measures introduced by
authorities concerning a limit (50 percent of the ex-factory cost) on the provision of foreign
exchange for advance payment for the import of capital goods may give rise to exchange
restrictions subject to Fund jurisdiction.
VIII. Article IV consultation
Namibia is on the standard 12-month Article IV consultation cycle; the last Article IV
consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on February 27, 2009 (IMF Country
Report No. 09/136).

4
During the Executive Board meeting, Directors commended the authorities' sound
macroeconomic management, which, together with a favorable external environment, has led
to robust economic growth and strong fiscal and external positions. Directors underscored the
need to scale down the expansionary fiscal stance to allow a more gradual increase in capital
expenditure while safeguarding fiscal sustainability. Directors considered that the exchange
rate peg to the South African rand remains appropriate, but stressed the limited scope for
effective independent monetary policy over the longer term. Directors also stressed the
importance of further progress in addressing the HIV/AIDS pandemic, high unemployment,
and large disparities of income.

III. STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of June 28, 2010)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance.
The authorities provide core monthly data to the Fund with a lag of one to two months,
except for the national accounts and international trade data, which are reported quarterly and
annually with longer lags. Frequent revisions affected real sector statistics and the balance of
payments, and the coverage of the international investment position (IIP) needs
strengthening.
Real sector statistics: National accounts. In 2008, the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS)
released updated national accounts data for 2000–07 that significantly revised the previous
series for both constant and current prices. The revisions reflect the introduction of an
expanded data survey that has resulted in a substantial upward adjustment to estimates of
output, particularly in the mining, services and manufacturing sectors. In addition, the
constant price series was rebased from 1995 to 2004 prices, with adjustments to the deflators
used for a number of sectors. As a result, gross domestic product measured in current prices
has increased by an average of 14 percent for the period 2000–07 over previous estimates,
while growth in real GDP increased by an average of 0.7 percentage points over previous
estimates. A regional IMF real sector advisor covering Botswana, Mauritius and, Namibia
assisted the CBS with these improvements. Seasonally adjusted quarterly national accounts
(QNA) estimates, at 2004 prices are disseminated on Namibia’s National Planning
Commission’s website, though there is a need to improve existing source data.
Price and labor market statistics: In February 2005, the government introduced a nationwide consumer price index to replace the previous index that only covered the capital city of
Windhoek; the new index is available from January 2002. However, the weights for the index
are estimated from the 1993–94 National Household Income and Expenditure Survey and
seasonal items and new products are excluded. Data on the labor market, including labor
force, employment, and wages are not systematically collected, which impedes the analysis
of labor market developments. The last labor market survey was conducted in 2008, but the
report is yet to be published.
Government finance statistics: Annual budgetary central government data by fiscal year,
which are reported on a cash basis in the GFSM 2001 format, are reasonably complete,
despite some gaps in terms of details. The authorities have compiled monthly data for the
2008 calendar year. Establishing regular reporting of these high frequency data is work in
progress. Currently, the African Department receives actual fiscal data (including

8
government debt) several months after the end of the fiscal year. No data are provided on
budget implementation during the fiscal year.
Monetary and financial statistics: Monthly monetary statistics for the Bank of Namibia
(BoN) and the other depository corporations (ODCs) are reported on a regular basis, although
there is room to improve the timeliness of reporting, particularly with regard to BoN data.
Beginning in April 2002, data are based on standardized report forms, which accord with the
concepts and definitions of the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual.
External sector statistics: Since 2001, the BoN has been reporting the balance of payments
data on a quarterly basis with a lag of one quarter. Those data are subject to substantial
revisions. The methodology underlying the balance of payments is consistent with the fifth
edition of the IMF’s Balance of Payments Manual. The international investment position
(IIP) data are compiled quarterly with a lag of one quarter. The Bank of Namibia has focused
its work to improve the compilation of capital and financial transactions and IIP statistics.
They have expanded their data collection capabilities through survey data collection.
However, further work is needed to expand the coverage of the IIP and restate the IIP in a
format that will allow for comparison with the balance of payments statistics.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Namibia is a participant in the General Data
Dissemination System (GDDS) since
December 19, 2002.

A ROSC (Data Module) was published in
2002 and updated in 2005.

III. Reporting to STA
The MOF have initiated regular reporting of annual data for publication in the Government
Finance Statistics Yearbook, while work on establishing monthly reporting of high frequency
data is in progress. Annual fiscal year data on budgetary central government through 2007/08
have been disseminated in the 2009 GFS Yearbook.
The BoN reports monetary and financial statistics to STA regularly. Balance of payments and
international investment position data are published in International Financial Statistics
(IFS) and in the Balance of Payments Yearbook. Namibia has recently reported revised data
for BoP covering the period 1999Q1-2009Q4, as well as revised data for IIP for the period
2004Q4-2009Q4.

IV. PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
1.
At end-2009, Namibia’s public debt is estimated at about N$12.9 billion,
(15.7 percent of GDP). About a third of the debt is owed to bilateral and multilateral foreign
creditors, while the rest is domestic debt. Since 2005, domestic debt has declined gradually
from around 23.1 percent of GDP to 11.3 percent at end-2009 due to strong fiscal
consolidation and prudent fiscal policies. Privatization receipts of 1.3 percent of GDP in
2006, from the sale of a telecommunications firm, contributed to the decline. Moreover, the
authorities decided to pay off some external debts and redeem maturing domestic debts in
FY 2009/10, which further reduced the public debt ratio. Given the expansionary stance of
fiscal policy in 2009/10-2010/11 and the projected drop in SACU revenue, current
projections suggest that the debt-to-GDP ratio will rise steadily in the medium term, reaching
29.1 percent in 2015, driven largely by rising domestic debt.
2.
Under the baseline scenario underlying the macroeconomic framework, the central
government primary budget balance shifted into a deficit in 2009 as government revenue
declined and the authorities increased expenditures to cushion the negative impact of the
global economic and financial crisis. With SACU revenue anticipated to decline from
10.5 percent of GDP in 2009/10 to a mere 2.8 percent in 2011/12, the fiscal deficit will pick
up to 8.3 percent of GDP in 2010/11 and 8.5 percent of GDP in 2011/12, up from 2.8 percent
of GDP in 2009/10, before trending down over the medium-term as fiscal consolidation takes
place. Consequently, the public debt to GDP ratio will increase rapidly, reaching 29.1 percent
of GDP by 2015, nearly doubling the level in 2009.
3.
Table 1 shows two scenarios. In the first scenario, with real GDP growth, real interest
rates, and the primary balance remaining at their historical 10 year averages, the public debt
to GDP ratio would fall to 9.9 percent of GDP by 2015, reflecting the relatively more benign
historical levels of the key variables, as well as a prudent fiscal stance that delivered primary
surpluses in the recent past. The second scenario shows the fiscal outcome if government’s
policies in 2009 remain unchanged, with the primary balance standing at 5.6 percent of GDP.
Indeed, if the fiscal consolidation under the baseline scenario does not take place, the debt
ratio could escalate to 45.3 percent of GDP by the end of the forecast period, thereby
breaching the authorities’ target range of 25 to 30 percent of GDP.
4.
The bounds tests reveal the vulnerability of the fiscal position to exogenous shocks
(Figure 1). The results show that with different levels of standard deviation shock to key
indicators, the debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to increase by between 5 to 10 percentage
points of GDP depending on the shock. The most benign shock is that from the unlikely
event of a 30 percent real depreciation in the South African rand, which could result in a
2 percentage point increase in the debt to GDP ratio, reflecting the relatively low level of
external debt in Namibia. However, the debt outlook remains sensitive to a negative growth
shock and an increase in contingent liabilities, which could lead to an increase in the debt to
GDP ratio by 9 and 10 percent of GDP respectively compared to the baseline scenario.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2010 Article IV Consultation with
Namibia
On July 23, 2010, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Namibia on a lapse of time basis. Under the IMF’s lapse of time
procedures, the Executive Board completes the Article IV consultations without convening
formal discussions.1
Background
The global crisis led to a contraction of Namibia’s economy in 2009, following a period of
relatively strong growth. Growth averaged 5.5 percent during 2006-08, supported by sound
macroeconomic policies and robust mining sector output. In 2009, however, growth is estimated
to have contracted by 0.8 percent, down from 4.3 percent a year earlier as mineral production,
especially diamond, dropped sharply in the wake of the global economic downturn. The 12month inflation rate, which dropped to 5 percent in April 2010, is trending down further thanks to
a decline in food and fuel prices and the strengthening in the South African rand, to which the
Namibian dollar is pegged at par.
The countercyclical measures implemented to support growth led to a deterioration of the fiscal
position. A drop in mineral revenue and lower Southern Africa Customs Union (SACU) revenue

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
combined with the stimulus measures shifted the fiscal position into a deficit of 2.8 percent of
GDP in 2009/10, after three years of fiscal surpluses.
In light of slowing economic activity and moderating inflation, and in line with the monetary
policy stance of the South African Reserve Bank (SARB), the Bank of Namibia (BoN) cut its
policy rate to 7 percent in June 2009, down from 10 percent at the end of 2008. However, since
April 2010, the BoN has maintained a 50 basis point positive differential with the SARB’s policy
rate. The financial sector weathered the global financial crisis relatively well; commercial banks
remain profitable and continue to benefit from effective supervision by the BoN.
The external position also deteriorated. The current account position is estimated to have
shifted into a deficit in 2009 on account of the drop in mineral exports and higher imports
associated with new mining projects. Gross international reserves remained relatively
unchanged at US$1.4 billion (3.4 months of imports) in 2009, supported by the allocation of
Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) that helped mitigate the impact of the decline in export
earnings.
The short-term growth outlook is positive but subject to downside risks. A recovery is in the
offing with growth projected at 4.4 percent in 2010, predicated on a strong rebound in the
mining and continued fiscal stimulus supporting construction and the services sectors. However,
a possible weakening of the recovery in the global economy and in South Africa could impact
negatively commodity prices and growth in the mining sector. The fiscal deficit is projected to
widen in 2010/11 as stimulus-related spending is maintained and SACU revenue drops further.
Executive Board Assessment
In concluding the 2010 Article IV Consultation with Namibia, Executive Directors endorsed
staff’s appraisal, as follows:
The economic recovery is well underway, supported by timely macroeconomic stimulus.
However, the outlook is subject to downside risks stemming from uncertain global economic
recovery, calling for coordination in the policy mix going forward. In particular, if external
demand for commodities weakens, and the thawing of financial markets is delayed, the
recovery could lose steam.
The countercyclical measures have been instrumental in cushioning the impact of the global
downturn, but have deteriorated the fiscal outlook. The authorities appropriately took advantage
of the fiscal space available entering the crisis to stimulate the economy. However, although an
expansionary fiscal stance in 2010/11 appears appropriate given the slack in economic activity
and uncertainties about the global recovery, careful attention should be paid to the quality of
spending and efforts need to be made to reorient spending in favor of quality capital projects
while protecting critical social programs.
A more ambitious fiscal consolidation than envisaged in the current Medium-Term Expenditure
Framework (2010/11–2012/13) is key to ensuring internal and external sustainability. Fiscal

3
consolidation should start from 2011/12 by targeting a reduction in the overall budget deficit so
as to preserve macroeconomic stability. Given the projected sharp drop in SACU revenue and
rapid debt accumulation in the medium term, the authorities need to step up efforts at reducing
public spending and mobilizing non-SACU revenue to reduce the projected fiscal deficits and
public debt to sustainable levels. In this context, containing the wage bill, accelerating the
reforms of state-owned enterprises (SOEs), and improving non-SACU revenue mobilization
should be accorded high priority.
Fiscal risks need to be closely monitored. The measures being undertaken by the authorities
need to be complemented by reforms, including strengthening the budget process, bringing into
effect the SOEs Governance Act, and establishing the institutional and legal framework for
Public Private Partnerships.
The exchange rate peg to the rand continues to be the main anchor of monetary policy. Despite
the peg to the South African rand, the Bank of Namibia’s monetary policy stance has started
since April 2010 to deviate from the interest rate policy of SARB. Staff believes that there is a
scope for reducing domestic interest rates by bringing the policy rate in line with South Africa’s.
Upgrading the supervision of nonbank financial institutions (NBFIs) and addressing concerns
about the tightening of the regulation on domestic investment requirements for pension funds
and insurance companies are critical to ensure financial stability. Speeding up the approval of
the Financial Institutions and Markets Bill, and strengthening Namibia Financial Institutions
Supervisory Authority as an independent body would go a long way in addressing weaknesses
in prudential regulations and supervision of the NBFIs. Regarding domestic investment
requirement, short of reversing it or reducing its rate, it is of paramount importance to monitor
closely the impact on pension funds with a view to mitigating risk taking by institutional investors
and safeguard their long-term financial viability.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.
