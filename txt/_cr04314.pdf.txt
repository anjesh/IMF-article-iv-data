Article IV consultation discussions were held in Moscow during June 15–25, 2004.
The mission met Deputy Prime Minister Zhukov, Minister of Finance Kudrin,
Central Bank of Russia Governor Ignatiev, other senior officials, members of the
Duma, representatives of the business and academic communities, and the press.

The staff team comprised Mr. Thomsen (head), Mr. Lall (PDR), Mmes. Ohnsorge and
Oomes, Mr. Owen (all EUR), Messrs. Spilimbergo (FAD) and Teo (MFD), and was
assisted by Mr. Kwon (Moscow Office). Mr. Mozhin, Executive Director for Russia,
and Mr. Palei, Senior Advisor to the Executive Director, participated in the
discussions.

•

In the last consultation, concluded on May 2, 2003, Directors commended the
authorities for generally strong macroeconomic performance, but recommended a
stronger focus on reducing inflation, with fiscal policy geared toward containing
upward pressures on the real exchange rate. They urged the authorities to reinvigorate
structural reforms in order to boost long-term growth.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background. Growth and the balance of payments have strengthened, driven by high oil prices
and increasing investment. However, macroeconomic tensions are rising, with core inflation
entrenched and the ruble appreciating briskly in real terms. Tightening labor markets and
emerging capacity constraints are adding to inflationary pressures. Monetary policy continues to
target both inflation and the ruble, and the authorities plan to loosen fiscal policy by spending
more of the oil revenue windfall. Progress on structural reforms has been limited. Recent efforts to
press ahead with reforms in the banking sector triggered some deposit runs, to which the central
bank responded with a substantial general liquidity injection and extension of household deposit
insurance to all banks.
Outlook. Growth is expected to remain robust over the near term, on current assumptions that oil
prices will stay relatively high and that negative repercussions from recent events in the banking
sector are temporary. The balance of payments should remain strong too, notwithstanding some
volatility in short-term capital flows. While external vulnerabilities are likely to remain low, there
are significant downside risks, associated not only with the oil price outlook but also with the
possibility that further turmoil in the banking system or the handling of the Yukos affair could
damage confidence. On planned policies, the pace of disinflation is likely to remain sluggish.
Policy discussions. The discussions focused on the following issues.
•

Plans to relax fiscal policy while burdening monetary policy with the task of limiting real
ruble appreciation point to increasing policy contradictions. Staff recommended that there
should be no further loosening of fiscal policy at this point in the economic cycle. The
authorities acknowledged that there were risks, but stressed that these had been weighed
carefully against the benefits of higher spending on reforms.

•

Monetary policy should focus on reducing inflation, unburdened of exchange rate
objectives. CBR officials agreed with staff that fiscal policy is the appropriate instrument
for limiting real appreciation. But, with little prospect of fiscal tightening and strong
political concerns about real appreciation, the CBR would maintain its dual targeting
regime, seeking to reduce inflation while limiting ruble appreciation.

•

Recent turmoil in the banking system highlights the need for the CBR to have strong
political support and more effective instruments as it seeks to strengthen banking
supervision and deal with problem banks. Following years of regulatory forbearance and
limited reforms, the authorities recognized that the current favorable macroeconomic
environment was likely masking problems that would only emerge when oil prices drop.
They agreed with staff that problems need to be addressed now, while the economy is
strong and systemic vulnerabilities are manageable.

•

Structural reform plans are ambitious but implementation has yet to be initiated. Some
senior officials shared staff’s concern that high oil prices and strong growth might be
causing complacency about reforms. They recognized that, in an environment of lower oil
prices, strong growth could only be maintained if reforms are accelerated.

I. ECONOMIC BACKGROUND
1.
GDP growth has increased and become better balanced since early 2003. It rose to
7¼ percent in 2003, with all main sectors, except agriculture, and most industrial sub-sectors
buoyant. Data for the first half of 2004 suggest that growth remains high, around 7½ percent,
and broadly based. The acceleration in 2003 was mainly due to higher investment, but also to
increased oil export volumes. With consumption growth still strong, driven by rising real
wages, all main demand components are now providing positive stimulus. The strength of
growth continues to hinge on the favorable external environment—notably higher energy
prices—but the rise in investment is likely also to have been due to political stability,
generally sound macroeconomic policies and some structural reforms, suggesting that GDP is
increasingly deriving strength from domestic factors as well.

Core inflation has become entrenched
and the ruble is now appreciating
briskly in real terms. Although headline
inflation has continued to decline, by
3 percentage points over the past year, this
is entirely accounted for by lower
increases in non-core elements of the price
index, notably administered prices, while
core inflation has remained in the 10–
11 percent range since mid-2002.1 With

Administered prices include prices of gas, electricity, and rail transportation, which are set at the federal level,
as well as a range of other prices set at lower levels of government. Core inflation also excludes most volatile

Box 2. Short-term Capital Flows 1/
In 2003, short-term net capital inflows were positive for the first time since the early 1990s.
While large capital outflows continued, they were offset by unprecedented net foreign borrowing by
the Russian corporate sector and Russian banks. Foreign direct investment remained small, partly
because of the still difficult business environment and partly because of the predominance of offshore transactions for large investments. Many inflows were likely driven by expectations of ruble
appreciation and the search for higher-yielding assets as low global interest rates compressed yields
for more mature market assets.
Most capital flows continue to be intermediated by the banking system, although non-bank
flows increased rapidly during 2003. During the first nine months of 2003, almost 60 percent of
capital inflows and a third of capital outflows were mediated by the international or Russian banking
system. Despite rapid net foreign borrowing by commercial banks during 2003, they remained net
lenders to international banks throughout 2003 and maintained positive net foreign assets for most of
2003 and the first half of 2004. Russian corporates also made heavy use of foreign borrowing,
increasingly through bond issues and syndicated loans. While syndicated loans were concentrated in
the energy and metals sectors, bond issues covered a wide range of sectors. Equity issues continued to
be small, reflecting in part a preference for debt financing.

contributed to the volatility in short-term

have been changes in expectations about

The CBR has intervened heavily to slow the ruble’s appreciation. Despite
changing its intervention policy at the beginning of 2003—from one of instigating a gradual
nominal depreciation to one of allowing some appreciation against the dollar—the CBR has
increased its net international reserves by over $40 billion since then. A slow predictable
appreciation against the dollar in the first half of 2003, and again in the fourth quarter of that
year, fuelled expectations about further appreciation and caused surges in short-term inflows
and attendant large interventions. Both of these periods were followed by large short-term
outflows as the intervention policy was changed so as to inject more uncertainty about nearterm exchange rate movements. Gross international reserves stood at $88 billion in mid-2004
(around seven months of imports and more than 200 percent of short-term external debt).

Increased interventions have caused a surge in money growth and contributed to
core inflation getting entrenched. Base money growth accelerated during 2003 and, despite
a recent decline, is still running at around 40 percent year-on-year. The CBR has only
sterilized a small part of its intervention, believing that more substantial sterilization would
merely attract additional capital inflows, and policy interest rates have been very low since
early 2003. The increase in unsterilized interventions has taken place at the same time as a
relaxation of fiscal policy has limited the extent to which higher government deposits at the
CBR could sterilize interventions.

Bank credits are rising fast. Broad money is recovering rapidly, with a notable shift
from foreign currency to ruble deposits, and with a reduction in foreign currency holdings
outside the banking system.2 This, together with the large reduction in banks’ net foreign
assets, has enabled a sharp increase in bank credits to the economy, by about 45 percent
during the past 12 months, and over 200 percent since the beginning of 2001. This surge has
coincided with booming real estate and, until recently, stock market prices. However, with
broad money and bank credits to the economy still amounting to only 27 percent and
22 percent of GDP, respectively, monetization and intermediation remain low compared to
other emerging market economies.

Fiscal relaxation continued in 2003. The general government surplus was about
1 percent of GDP, only ½ percentage point higher than in 2002, despite the acceleration in
GDP and significantly higher oil taxes. Measured at a constant oil price of $20 per barrel, the

general government deficit increased by 1 percent of GDP, to about 1¼ percent, continuing
the relaxation underway since 2001. This suggests that fiscal policy was notably pro-cyclical
in 2003, although the concept of an oil price adjusted fiscal balance only provides an
indication of the cyclically-adjusted fiscal position (Box 3). The reduction in non-energy
sector taxes by 1 percent of GDP reflects the impact of tax cuts.

The 2004 budget entails some tightening of the fiscal stance, but a renewed
relaxation is likely in 2005. The planned tightening in 2004, of almost 1 percent of GDP, to
be achieved by reducing non-interest expenditures, would nearly balance the budget at an oil
price of $20 per barrel. While, in recent years, the authorities have yielded to within-year
pressures resulting from high oil prices to increase spending limits, they expect to be able to
resist such pressures this year, partly by pushing the next wage indexation to early 2005.
Their ability to resist has been strengthened by the recent creation of an oil stabilization fund,
which accumulates revenues arising from oil prices above $20 per barrel. However, the
government’s draft 2005 budget entails reduced saving of oil revenues and an attendant
relaxation of fiscal policy, as discussed in Section II.
9.
There has been only limited progress on structural reforms for two years.
Reforms of the pension system and the electricity sector were scaled down, while reforms of
Gazprom, the public administration, and the social and military sectors effectively stalled.
The only major legislation adopted was the introduction of deposit insurance and the
liberalization of capital flows. The deposit insurance law aims at leveling the playing field
between state and private banks by extending insurance (for household deposits up to
Ruble 100,000) to all qualified banks. Banks that do not meet strict prudential eligibility
criteria will lose their license to take retail deposits by September 2005. The liberalization of
capital flows is far-reaching; the law eliminates the existing system of permits and controls,
and empowers the CBR to impose unremunerated deposit requirements on capital flows. The
CBR has decided to avail itself of this opportunity by introducing moderate deposit
requirements on both inflows and outflows with effect from August 1, 2004, citing the

Staff analysis of the direct impact of oil prices on energy taxes suggests that a $1 decline in
the oil price would reduce revenues by ⅓ percent of GDP.1 On this basis, at a Urals oil price
of $20 a barrel, the general government would have run a deficit of 1¼ percent of GDP in
2003, compared with the recorded surplus (at the actual Urals oil price of $27 a barrel) of
1 percent of GDP. This represents an underlying loosening, at constant oil prices, of
4 percent of GDP since 2000.
This calculation does not take account of the impact of the economic cycle on the fiscal
balance, estimates of which are hampered by the lack of any normal economic cycles during
most of the transition period so far. However, given the strong correlation of GDP growth
with the oil price since 1995, it is clear that the above calculation understates the total impact
of changes in the oil price on the fiscal balance. Based on estimates, including those of the
ministry of economy, that a reduction in oil prices of $1 a barrel would reduce GDP in the
short term by ¼–½ percent, and given that general government revenues are about one third
of GDP, a conservative estimate of the indirect impact on the budget of a $20 oil price in
2003, via lower GDP, would be in the range ½–1 percent of GDP. Thus, the total impact on
the budget—direct plus indirect—of a $1 change in the oil price could be nearly ½ percent of
GDP. Figures quoted elsewhere in the text and in tables only take account of the direct
impact, for which estimates are relatively soundly based.

pressures on the ruble to appreciate and the need to protect the still weak banking system
from the impact of volatile external flows.
10.
Considerable weaknesses remain in the banking system and the regulatory
framework. According to soundness indicators, based on Russian Accounting Standards,
banks overall have been profitable and are adequately provisioned and capitalized. Asset
quality has been improving in tandem with the strong macroeconomic environment.
However, structural weaknesses remain, including an economy and banking system that is
highly sensitive to oil prices; concentrated exposures, many to related parties; a nontransparent operating environment, with poor corporate governance and risk management;
weak creditor rights; unreliable financial statements; an inadequate bank bankruptcy law, and
a history of supervisory and prudential forbearance. Meanwhile, Sberbank continues to
dominate the system, and there has been no progress in developing a strategy for its future.3

11.
Increased regulatory vigilance in recent months has sparked turmoil in parts of
the banking system. The CBR has strengthened enforcement of prudential standards as part
of the process of enrolling banks in the deposit insurance scheme and enforcing AML/CFT
legislation. As these processes unfolded, some banks have faced liquidity problems arising
from depositor nervousness. Since the closure of a bank in May, nine other private banks—
two among the top 25 in terms of assets—have publicly acknowledged liquidity problems
and three have been closed. After Guta Bank, one of the top 25, suspended operations
because of a deposit run in July, other private banks also experienced runs and the CBR took
strong measures to restore confidence, including support for the purchase of Guta Bank by
state-owned Vneshtorgbank (VTB), a halving of reserve requirements to 3½ percent, and
immediate extension of deposit insurance to all banks, even those that fail to meet the
eligibility criteria for the new scheme.4 State-owned banks have been seen as a safe haven
during the turmoil among private banks.
12.
The prospects for early WTO accession have improved. The main outstanding
problems hindering accession appear to have been overcome with the recent agreement
between Russia and the EU, including on a phased increase in domestic energy prices. The
authorities hope that accession will take place by end-2005.
II. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
13.
With signs that strong GDP growth and the favorable balance of payments are
causing macroeconomic tensions, and with the new government planning to implement
reforms that will be costly to the budget, discussions of macroeconomic policies focused
primarily on balancing concerns about short-term macroeconomic risks and the desire to
advance reforms. Discussions of other issues were mainly concerned with the risk of serious
disruptions in the banking system, including from a drop in oil prices, and with the structural
reforms needed to strengthen the economy’s ability to sustain rapid growth with lower oil
prices. The discussions were timely, as the new government was at the early stages of
preparing the 2005 budget and formulating its medium-term reform program.
14.
The Fund’s policy advice in recent years has focused on the need to reduce inflation
to a low and stable rate; gearing fiscal policy to the economic and oil price cycles so as to
limit pressures for real ruble appreciation; the need for strong structural reforms to improve
the investment climate and limit the economy’s dependence on the natural resource sector;
and measures to strengthen the supervisory and regulatory framework for banks. Progress in
these areas has been mixed, with the rise in world energy and commodity prices leading to
pressures for fiscal relaxation, slow progress on disinflation, and a weakening resolve to
tackle vested interests opposed to reforms.

4

Deposits in banks that cannot meet the eligibility criteria for the regular deposit insurance scheme will be
guaranteed by the CBR, subject to the same terms as the general scheme. Any unrecoverable cost to the CBR
will eventually become a charge on the budget.

A. Outlook
15.
Real GDP growth is likely to remain robust over the near term. On the
assumption that oil prices remain relatively high and that there are no adverse jolts to the
investment climate, recent trends in the main components of demand are likely to be
sustained, except for some decline in the contribution of net exports, reflecting the impact of
real ruble appreciation and a slowing of oil export volume growth from exceptional rates
over the past two years. Staff projects GDP growth of 7¼ percent in 2004, slowing only
slightly to 6½ percent in 2005, on the assumption of a Urals oil price of $30 a barrel in 2004,
and $28½ in 2005 (Table 1). The authorities are somewhat less optimistic, projecting
6½ percent growth in 2004 and 6 percent in 2005, based on lower Urals oil price assumptions
of $29 and $26 a barrel respectively.
16.
The outlook is, however, subject to much uncertainty, with notable downside
risks. In addition to the oil price outlook, uncertainty arises from the risk that recent turmoil
in the banking system and concerns among investors about the handling of the Yukos affair
could impact negatively on investment and capital flows. While there is little evidence as yet
of any adverse impact of the Yukos affair on investment, it has likely contributed to the
volatility of capital flows. In addition, the initiation of bankruptcy procedures against Yukos
could disrupt oil production, with a possibly significant direct negative impact on exports and
GDP. Moreover, sale of Yukos’ assets in anything other than a transparent manner, at fair
market prices, would be very damaging to confidence. The outlook assumes that the
authorities are successful in restoring confidence to the banking system, and that their
handling of the Yukos affair does not lead to widespread concerns among investors about the
transparency, fairness and even-handedness of the enforcement of laws and regulations. The
authorities’ assurances in this regard, and their intention to advance structural reforms,
underlie the staff’s assumption that any negative repercussions of recent events are likely to
be temporary.
17.
Growth is assumed to slow over the medium term from its current rapid pace.
Most studies, including by the ministry of economy, put trend growth at about 5 percent,
reflecting estimates that perhaps 2 percentage points of last year’s growth was due to
exceptionally high oil prices, and assuming steady progress on structural reforms. The staff’s
medium-term scenario assumes growth will slow to this rate as oil and other commodity
prices decline to more normal levels (Table 2). On this view, the economy is presently
roughly at potential and would remain on that track over the medium-term.
18.
The balance of payments should remain strong. As to the remainder of 2004 and
2005, rapid domestic demand growth and real ruble appreciation are driving strong import
growth, but this should be offset by the impact of high oil prices this year (Table 3).
Although capital inflows will likely be lower than in 2003, reflecting the developments
during the first half of the year discussed in paragraph 3, reserve accumulation is still
expected to be substantial, at around $20 billion this year. Looking to the medium term, as oil
and commodity prices return to more normal levels, the current account surplus is likely to
decline. However, net private capital inflows should increase over time, reflecting higher

- 16 -

direct investment as reforms take hold, as well as continued shorter-term inflows, not least
because slow progress in reducing inflation is likely to cause continued sizeable interest rate
differentials.
19.
External vulnerabilities are, therefore, likely to remain low. Public external debt,
net of reserves, has already fallen close to

20.
On planned policies, the pace of
disinflation is expected to remain sluggish, at best. The authorities are targeting headline
inflation of 8–10 percent in 2004 and 6½–8½ percent in 2005, and expect that real effective
ruble appreciation can be limited to 3–7 percent a year. The authorities may continue to meet
headline inflation targets, primarily through restraint of administered prices. However, as
discussed below, staff believes that without a change in the policies discussed with the
mission, the authorities will struggle to lower core inflation substantially while reducing the
pace of real ruble appreciation, barring a much sharper reduction in oil prices than currently
expected (Table 6).
B. Fiscal Policy
21.
Pressures for fiscal relaxation to finance reforms are increasing. According to
ministry of finance officials, the view is gaining ground that Russia should take advantage of
the oil tax windfall to accelerate costly reforms, and that this will have no serious
macroeconomic implications as long as the budget is in surplus. The government is
determined to cut the unified social tax (UST) and launch a major expenditure reform by
replacing many existing in-kind benefits—so called “unfunded mandates”5—with monetary
benefits, at a cost to the 2005 budget of about 2 percent of GDP.6 The government is,
5

Expenditure responsibilities devolved from the federal government to sub-national governments without any
identified source of financing. In practice, some of these benefits are financed by enterprises that provide
services to certain beneficiaries free of charge.

6

See Selected Issues, Chapter 4. The UST cut is estimated to reduce revenues of the extrabudgetary funds by
1¼ percent of GDP. The draft budget envisages an increased federal transfer to the pension fund to cover about
half of this shortfall. Federal spending will also increase by about ¾ percent of GDP to finance the monetization
of in-kind benefits.

- 17 -

however, resisting pressures for larger tax cuts and higher infrastructure spending. Reflecting
significant expenditure savings in other areas, mostly at the local government level, the draft
budget for 2005 assumes that the relaxation at constant oil prices will be only about
¼ percent of GDP. Officials felt that this would not pose macroeconomic problems. Overall,
they judged that the proposed fiscal stance carefully balanced macroeconomic risks and the
need to facilitate reforms.
22.
Less oil taxes will be saved. Officials explained that, whereas all revenues arising
from oil prices above $20 a barrel are currently being saved in the stabilization fund, only
half of such revenues will be saved once the existing cap on the fund of Ruble 500 billion
(about 2¾ percent of GDP) is reached. This will happen by mid-2005 under the budget’s oil
price assumption of $26 a barrel, and much earlier if prices remain at current levels. The half
that will be spent will be transferred to the pension fund to cover the gap left by the cut in the
UST. The other half will be saved outside the stabilization fund, and could be used for early
repayment of debt.
23.
Staff found that the relaxation could be significantly higher than assumed in the
budget. It doubted the realism of the assumed expenditure savings, in particular the
assumption that regional and local governments will cut spending by around 1½ percent of
GDP and run a surplus of ¾ percent of GDP. In view of the still weak framework for
controlling spending at lower levels of government, staff argued that sub-national
governments should be assumed to balance their budgets, at best. Overall, it expected the
draft budget to entail a relaxation of the general government stance at constant oil prices of
1–1¼ percent of GDP in 2005 (Tables 7–8).
24.
Staff argued that fiscal policy should not add stimulus at this point in the
economic cycle. In view of already existing macroeconomic tensions and the favorable
outlook for private demand and the balance of payments, fiscal policy should not be
loosened. A case could be made for tightening, but staff felt that an unchanged stance would
strike an appropriate balance between macroeconomic concerns and the need to advance
reforms. Additional measures yielding savings or revenues of 1–1¼ percent of GDP in 2005
were therefore needed. The implication was also that revenues from oil prices above the
current benchmark of $20 per barrel should continue to be saved in the stabilization fund and
that the cap on the fund should be lifted.
25.
Ministry of finance officials agreed that the budget entailed somewhat increased
macroeconomic risks. They acknowledged that it would be challenging to ensure the
assumed expenditure restraint at local and regional levels. Scope for other savings was,
however, very limited, and the UST and expenditure reforms could not be scaled back at this
stage. The officials reiterated that risks had been weighed against benefits of lower non-oil
taxes and expenditure reforms.
26.
The authorities expect tax cuts to yield early benefits. Some senior officials
dismissed staff’s concerns about the draft budget, expecting that the cut in UST would have a
stronger impact on the revenue base than assumed in the draft. They also felt that this cut
would quickly lead to higher investment and GDP growth. While supportive of cutting the

- 18 -

UST, staff warned that more optimistic assumptions about the impact on the revenue base are
not supported by international experience. It also cautioned that the impact on investment
will depend on broader reforms to improve the investment climate. Staff welcomed the
efforts to eliminate unfunded mandates, but questioned whether the attendant monetization of
in-kind benefits was sufficiently well targeted.
27.
There is a need to clarify policy objectives. The increasing support for immediate
fiscal relaxation to finance reforms conflicts with the authorities’ unwillingness to accept real
ruble appreciation. On the current outlook, preventing any real appreciation—as advocated
by some officials—would require a benchmark for the stabilization fund well below the
existing $20 a barrel, significantly reducing scope for costly reforms. Staff argued that some
gradual real appreciation is inevitable and desirable (Box 4). It acknowledged that this
assessment is subject to much uncertainty as it depends on whether the strength of the
balance of payments is temporary or permanent, the impact of reforms on competitiveness,
and the quality of reforms burdening the budget, among other factors. But, whatever the
conclusions about the sustainable pace of real appreciation, there was a need for consistency
with the fiscal stance. Relaxing fiscal policy to finance reforms, while burdening monetary
policy with the task of controlling the real exchange rate, pointed to increasing contradictions
in the policy mix.
28.
Fiscal policy is facing important medium-term challenges. The authorities’ plans
for further reductions in the non-oil tax burden beyond 2005, and the need to mobilize
additional resources for important reforms and improvements in social services, suggest that
the pressures on limited public sector resources are set to remain high. The outlook for public
debt—currently only around 25 percent of GDP and set to decline further—suggests little
cause for concern about debt sustainability, even under a scenario with markedly lower oil
prices (Table 9). Staff therefore recognized that, once the current cyclical pressures ease,
there could be a case for spending more of the oil revenues on carefully elaborated long-term
structural reforms. It cautioned, however, that medium-term fiscal loosening should be
tempered by the existence of substantial unfunded pension liabilities, contingent liabilities,
including those resulting from the recent introduction of deposit insurance, and the need to
ensure that fiscal policy does not add to volatility in GDP in what remains a highly oil
dependent economy.
C. Monetary Policy
29.
CBR officials explained that monetary policy will target headline inflation of
10 percent by end-2004 and 7½ percent by end-2005. They expected slower administered
price increases to continue to bear down on inflation, and said that the CBR has no target for
core inflation. Some senior officials doubted that there would be much progress in reducing
core inflation as long as pressures to resist ruble appreciation persist.

Box 4. Indicators of Russia’s Competitiveness
According to available indicators, Russia’s competitiveness remains adequate on a number of measures, although there are some
signs of increasing pressures, particularly from rising labor costs.

• While a rebound of Russia’s real effective exchange rate following the post-1998 crisis depreciation was inevitable, the rate
of increase of both the CPI- and ULC-based REER has declined substantially since 2002; although appreciation has picked
up over the past year, it remains well below the growth rates seen from 1999 to 2002.

• Productivity growth has been strong and rising, particularly in the industrial sector. The unit labor cost-based REER has
nonetheless risen by more than the CPI-based measure since the crisis, reflecting the rapid recovery of wages following a
sharp post-crisis decline in real wages.

• There are no obvious signs from producer price developments of deteriorating price competitiveness, although profitability
may have declined as costs have risen. Comparing sectoral to overall producer prices, the evidence suggests that while
relative prices of tradable commodities have gone up (reflecting increases in world commodity prices), those of
manufacturers have not, and even those of construction (a classic nontradable) have remained below the average. This
suggests that cost pressures associated with the commodity price boom are not being passed on to prices of nontradables and
noncommodity exports.

• Despite real exchange rate appreciation, Russia has broadly maintained its share of nonoil exports in world markets, while
increasing its share of total world trade.

30.
The CBR will continue the dual targeting policy of seeking to reduce inflation
and stem ruble appreciation. CBR officials acknowledged that monetary policy could resist
real ruble appreciation only in the short term, although they took this to be longer than did
the mission; that the pressure on the CBR in this regard had been a main reason for the slow
progress in reducing inflation; and that a fiscal tightening would be the appropriate
instrument for pursuing real exchange rate objectives. However, with little prospect for such
a tightening and considering political concerns about real ruble appreciation, the CBR could
not accept staff’s recommendation to give priority to the inflation target, and to reduce or
cease interventions and allow nominal appreciation if interventions threatened the inflation
target. Thus, while monetary policy would target some further reduction in inflation, the
exchange rate objective would not be subordinated to the inflation target, and the official
monetary policy guidelines for 2005 would likely again include an explicit limit for real ruble
appreciation as a target for monetary policy.
31.
There is limited scope for sterilization. CBR officials argued that sterilization
would be largely ineffective in the current situation, as the attendant upward pressure on
interest rates would increase inward capital inflows. The mission saw somewhat more scope
for sterilization but agreed that this would not be an effective instrument on a large scale.
32.
In view of these limitations, CBR officials believed that fiscal relaxation would
make it difficult to meet the inflation target. They felt that the proposed relaxation of fiscal
policy assumed in the draft 2005 budget was relatively modest—the best that could be hoped
for in the current policy environment. But they were concerned that the weakening of the
stabilization fund mechanism meant that there would be less of a safeguard against spending
higher-than-expected oil revenues. This was a problem since the oil price assumption in the
budget was conservative, suggesting that revenues might well be higher than budgeted. In the
event that such revenues were spent—or if, as staff warned, spending at regional and local
levels was likely to be higher than assumed in the 2005 budget—the end-2005 inflation target
might not be met.
33.
Staff felt that monetary policy was too accommodating of inflationary pressures
from fiscal relaxation. On planned policies, such pressures would intensify, unless oil prices
fell significantly from recent levels. Staff believed that the cost to the economy of high
inflation was not sufficiently recognized—notwithstanding President Putin’s recent call for
lower inflation—and that the cost of appreciation was exaggerated. With some real
appreciation inevitable, staff argued that the choice for monetary policy is whether this
should take place through higher inflation or nominal ruble appreciation. Staff urged the
CBR to take advantage of the disinflationary impact of nominal appreciation to set core
inflation on a more ambitious downward course. But the pace of disinflation was less
important than the commitment not to let the inflation target give way to exchange rate
considerations. Staff called for the CBR to focus on core inflation—although it might
continue officially to target headline inflation—and urged that administered prices not be
used to control inflation. Continued administered price restraint could not be sustained
without seriously threatening reforms of the natural monopolies.

- 21 -

34.
CBR officials believed that nominal ruble appreciation would encourage capital
inflows. They noted that the two episodes of large inflows last year had occurred during
periods when the ruble had been appreciating. Staff argued that these had been periods when
a controlled slow and steady nominal appreciation had in effect eliminated short-term
exchange rate uncertainty, encouraging speculative bets on ruble appreciation at a time when
high domestic interest rates were already attracting inflows. Making clear to the market that
monetary policy would be firmly focused on reducing inflation would increase short-term
exchange rate uncertainty and so discourage speculative flows. But, with the balance of
payments fundamentally strong and the still high rate of inflation implying that interest rate
differentials would be large for the foreseeable future, staff warned that fundamentals pointed
to continued pressures for medium and long-term capital inflows. This was yet another
argument for faster disinflation.
35.
Unremunerated deposit requirements will be imposed on capital flows. CBR
officials were determined to avail themselves of the right under the new foreign exchange
law to invoke such requirements. While they agreed with the law’s objective of liberalizing
capital controls, deposit requirements were needed to control inflows of volatile short-term
capital to weak banks. They would also help stem ruble appreciation.
36.
Staff questioned the effectiveness of deposit requirements. While appropriate as a
transitional measure from the system of permits and controls, the experience of other
countries suggests that the main result of such requirements is to raise the cost of capital,
especially for small and medium-sized enterprises. Their impact on inflows is transitory, at
best, as markets quickly learn how to evade them. They should, therefore, be seen only as a
temporary measure, reserved to deal with exceptionally large inflows, and not as a substitute
for a more flexible exchange rate policy. Staff agreed with concerns about inflows to weak
banks, but argued that strong banking supervision was the more effective instrument in this
regard.
37.
CBR officials confirmed the intention to move to inflation targeting over the
medium term. The necessary conditions for doing so—including technical requirements
identified by MFD—were likely to be in place in 2–3 years, at the earliest.
D. Financial Sector Vulnerabilities7
38.
The CBR is determined to enforce stricter prudential standards. CBR officials
stressed that the recent closure of a small bank reflected this—it was the first closure since
the 1998 crisis of a bank that had not already defaulted. The forthcoming comprehensive
review of banks wanting to join the new deposit insurance scheme and the enforcement of
new AML/CTF legislation would provide an opportunity to implement stricter standards.
7

The mission took place soon after the CBR’s closure of a bank for violation of AML legislation, and the initial
problems that arose in this regard were discussed during the mission. The acute turmoil, precipitated by the
closure, occurred after the mission and was discussed with the authorities by staff of the Fund’s Moscow Office.

- 22 -

While many banks that did not meet such standards would be able to take corrective actions
or merge with stronger banks, CBR officials expected additional closures.
39.
The banking system faces increasing risk. CBR stress tests confirm that credit risks
have increased, not least because of recent rapid credit growth, as well as the larger exposure
to oil price related risk and the economy’s dependence on such prices. They found that a
shock as severe as the 1998 crisis would result in losses of 4 percent of GDP, based on end2003 data; the FSAP test on the basis of end-2001 data had estimated losses of 3 percent of
GDP. Officials agreed with staff that liquidity risk has also increased. While liquidity
remains high for the system as a whole, the lack of an effective interbank market, of assets
that can serve as collateral, and of transparency about ownership of banks and their activities
mean that individual banks may be vulnerable to depositor nervousness, as demonstrated by
recent events.
40.
CBR officials believed, however, that systemic
and macroeconomic vulnerabilities are limited. They
noted that the monetization of the economy is still relatively
low. Moreover, about ⅔ of household deposits are with
CBR-owned Sberbank and a few other state-owned banks,
which enjoy a government guarantee of their deposits and
have generally been viewed as a safe haven for depositors in
times of turbulence, as during the recent turmoil. They also
noted that external vulnerabilities have declined to low
levels: the public sector’s debt, net of foreign reserves, is
close to zero, and the corporate sector’s debt is also limited,
as it regained access to markets only a few years ago.

blunt. The new interim deposit insurance law had helped to
restore confidence, but it entails some moral hazard, and its stabilizing role will be
undermined if payouts to depositors are not rapid. CBR officials stressed the need for
passage of amendments to the bank bankruptcy law, to provide for more certain and speedy
resolution processes and so allow the CBR to intervene effectively with minimum
implications for confidence in the system. Staff also agreed with officials about the need to
broaden the range of eligible collateral to facilitate the provision of targeted liquidity to
sound banks experiencing deposit runs. More generally, staff noted that the episode
demonstrated the importance of the CBR being transparent when closing banks and
expeditious when faced with negative consequences.

42.
Staff was concerned that recent events might lead to continued regulatory
forbearance. It felt that there had only been very limited progress in implementing banking
reforms since the 1998 crisis, notwithstanding the recent steps to strengthen enforcement of

- 23 -

prudential norms, and worried that high oil prices and strong growth could be masking
longstanding problems. It stressed the importance of tackling the problems now, while they
were still manageable, and while the economy was strong and there were resources available
to recapitalize banks if necessary. International experience had shown that, if unaddressed,
the problems would only get bigger. The CBR would need the full support of the government
in exercising its mandate to strengthen supervision, notably in the context of reviewing
banks’ applications for participation in the deposit insurance scheme. Staff reminded the
CBR that this had been seen as the cardinal mechanism for strengthening the banking system,
and regulatory forbearance during the process would seriously increase the risks of a major
crisis in the future. In this regard, it was worrisome that some recent statements by officials
from other parts of government raised doubts about the broader political support for the
process.
43.
Medium-term reforms need to be accelerated. Priorities include moving to riskbased supervision, improving governance and transparency of bank ownership, and adopting
International Financial Reporting Standards. CBR officials noted that these are all reflected
in the authorities’ medium-term action plan. While acknowledging that the plan was
generally well focused, staff expressed concern that it did not give priority to the
development of a strategy for state-owned banks, notably Sberbank. While these banks have
been a stabilizing force by acting as safe havens during periods of turmoil, they are subject to
many of the same concerns regarding transparency and governance as private banks. It would
be highly regrettable if periodic bouts of nervousness about the soundness of private banks,
combined with the absence of any strategy for the state-owned banks, led to a consolidation
of the dominant position of the state-owned banks and stifled the development of a more
dynamic and competitive banking sector.
E. Structural Reforms
44.
The authorities intend to undertake a broadly-based acceleration of reforms.
Among the main priorities are general administrative reforms and comprehensive reforms of
the health, education, housing, and military sectors, in addition to the tax and banking
reforms discussed above. Ongoing reforms of the natural monopolies also remain high on the
agenda. Officials of the ministry of economy and trade explained that the new government
had decided on its broad priorities, but was still in the process of elaborating its programs and
was not ready to discuss details, including timing of key steps, with the mission.
45.
Officials explained that the overarching objective is to reduce dependence on oil
by improving the investment climate, beginning with public sector reforms. The public
sector’s large claim on resources and still pervasive interference in the economy, not least at
local and regional levels, remain serious deterrents to private investment, particularly for
small and medium-sized enterprises. The authorities are, therefore, giving priority to reforms
of this sector, focusing increasingly on expenditure reforms now that the main tax reforms
are nearing completion. General administrative reforms are particularly important. They
involve streamlining at all levels of government, elimination of overlapping functions, and a
general reduction in the role of government in the economy. The reforms of specific sectors
are intended to address a wide array of problems. Common to these reforms is the

- 24 -

establishment of performance targets and a shift to performance based budgeting. Some of
these reforms will be politically very difficult, not least because they involve eliminating
provisions establishing general entitlements to housing and social services, provisions left
over from central planning and unsuitable to a market economy. (Structural fiscal reforms are
discussed in Box 5.)
46.
Other parts of the reform program will also improve the investment climate. Housing
reforms, including development of the mortgage market, are important for labor mobility,
the lack of which produces large regional income inequality and limits potential GDP growth
by causing regional labor shortages.8 Reforms of the banking sector—as discussed above—
are key to improving what, despite recent increases, is still a relatively low level of financial
intermediation, to the detriment of small and medium-sized enterprises. The drive for early
WTO accession will catalyze key reforms, promote competition and reduce rent-seeking. On
the strength of this broad-based acceleration of reforms, officials believe that Russia would
be on track to meet President Putin’s challenge to double GDP in ten years.
47.
Staff welcomed the basic thrust of the government’s reform program, especially
its focus on the investment climate, but was concerned about the lack of specificity and
in particular about the lack of support for implementation. It broadly shared the
authorities’ views of priorities, especially the focus on reforms of government to reduce the
public sector’s interference in the economy, including corruption. But, stressing that several
of the most important reforms in this area remained to be elaborated, staff worried that the
process of preparing reforms for implementation could be lengthy, since this would be
politically and technically difficult. In this regard, staff noted that most of the reform
objectives on the government’s agenda are not new, but that preparation of reforms or
implementation of those that had been prepared and approved have been stalled for some
time because of resistance from vested interests. In some areas—like reforms of Gazprom—
there appeared to be no agreement on the basic concept, and in others—like reforms of
military, housing, education and health sectors—there was agreement on broad objectives but
not on detailed plans. In still other areas—like pension and electricity reforms—original
plans were being scaled back or subject to protracted implementation periods. Overall, there
had been very limited progress during the past two years, and staff worried that high oil
prices and robust growth were causing complacency about reforms.
48.
Russia’s trade regime remains moderately open. Its average tariff rate is about
11 percent. Officials informed staff that bilateral negotiations regarding WTO accession had
been completed with partners accounting for three-quarters of trade, but issues relating to
market access for automobiles, aircraft and agricultural products were outstanding with
remaining countries. Liberalization of the services sector also remains an outstanding issue.
Staff welcomed the progress on WTO accession, and urged the authorities to resist
opposition from sectors seeking to maintain protective barriers by unduly prolonging

See Selected Issues, Chapter 5.

- 25 Box 5: Medium-term Structural Fiscal Reform
Fiscal reforms play a key role in the authorities’ ambitious long-term strategy to diversify the economy and double GDP in ten
years. To achieve these objectives, the authorities plan to:
•
•
•

Cut the tax burden on the non-oil sector by about 1 percentage point of GDP a year for the next few years. The authorities
believe that redistributing the tax burden from the non-oil to the oil sector will promote economic diversification;
Increase taxation of oil sector rents associated with exceptionally high oil prices; a policy of saving windfall oil revenues will
play a stabilizing role, as federal fiscal revenues become increasingly dependent on oil;
Rationalize public expenditure to eliminate the remaining legacy of subsidies and inefficiency.

This strategy, which the staff broadly supports, requires measures in the fields of tax and expenditure policy, fiscal federalism, and quasifiscal activities.
Revenues
Unified social tax is a regressive tax, which is particularly burdensome to small and medium-sized enterprises. The authorities have
decided to cut the top rate from 36 percent to 26 percent starting next year, at an estimated cost of 1–1½ percent of GDP. While the
reduction is welcome, it is important that this does not threaten the sustainability of the pension system.
VAT. The authorities plan to unify the rates (currently 18 percent and 10 percent), probably at 16 percent, in 2006 or 2007. The
unification of the rate will reduce distortions and simplify tax administration. However, staff has cautioned against further rate
reductions, arguing that the focus should be on cutting other less efficient taxes.
Oil taxes. The authorities have increased the marginal rates of export and extraction taxes when the price of Urals oil is above $25 a
barrel, effective in 2005.
Tax administration. Poor rules on transfer pricing are a key weakness of tax administration, especially in the oil sector. An
amendment to the tax code is needed to eliminate abuses.
Expenditure
The authorities’ long-term goal is to reduce the size of the government and rationalize expenditures. The goal is commendable, given that
the legacy of the command economy is still present in many areas.
Expediting civil service and public administration reforms is essential to improve governance and raise the efficiency of public
expenditure, and should be a top priority. The government has started a sweeping reform of the public sector by reorganizing several
ministries and agencies, but a huge amount of work is still ahead.
Reforms in the military, health, and education sectors are urgent to improve the efficiency of services.
Reforms of energy pricing are long overdue, to reduce quasi-fiscal activities and promote reforms throughout the economy.
While the authorities are committed to increase domestic gas and electricity prices over the next few years, staff is concerned that the
pace might be too slow, in part because the authorities see restraint of administered price increases as a way to reduce headline
inflation.
Fundamental decisions are need to ensure the long term sustainability of the pension system, in view of the projected aging of
the population.
State-owned housing and subsidized communal services companies are inefficient and financially nonviable. Reforms in this
area are necessary to rationalize public expenditure, especially at local government level. Moreover, housing reforms would reduce
obstacles to intra-regional labor mobility.
Other reforms
Intergovernmental relations. Expenditure responsibilities among different layers of government remain inefficient and
nontransparent. A major reform is underway.
The plan to reduce unfunded mandates and monetize some in-kind benefits is an important step toward making public subsidies
more transparent. It needs to be accompanied by a hardening of budget constraints of public enterprises providing the services, to
ensure fiscal neutrality.
Budget process. The government has recently started a reform of the budget process, which aims to improve efficiency in the
formulation and administration of the budget, including through the introduction of performance-based budgeting.
Overall evaluation
While the staff broadly supports the strategy, it is concerned that strong growth and high oil prices may weaken the resolve to press ahead
with these and other reforms. It considers that broad structural reforms and not redistributive tax cuts are the best way to promote economic
diversification and sustained growth. In line with the conclusions of the recent fiscal transparency ROSC, it would also like to see a higher
priority given to reforms of major public enterprises and the reduction of associated quasi-fiscal activities.

- 26 -

transition periods before being exposed to foreign competition. The authorities explained that
Russia is also pursuing liberalization within the Eurasian Economic Community (consisting,
besides Russia, of Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, and Tajikistan), although the
customs agreement is expected to come fully into force only after WTO accession. Staff
reminded the authorities of the need for speedy removal of all exchange restrictions subject
to Article VIII.
III. STAFF APPRAISAL
49.
Russia’s economic situation is good, but handling growing tensions will be a
challenge. GDP growth is high and is becoming broader based and better balanced;
employment and incomes are rising; and key social indicators are improving. With oil prices
likely to remain high, the outlook is good, provided the authorities are forceful in addressing
recent problems in the banking system and their handling of the Yukos case does not damage
the investment climate by raising increasing concerns about the transparency, evenhandedness, and political impartiality of the judicial and regulatory system. With these
important caveats, the challenge to macroeconomic policies will be to deal with tensions
associated with high growth and a strong balance of payments.
50.
Contradictions in macroeconomic policies appear to be rising. They have been
prevalent for some time: fiscal relaxation has exacerbated the pressures for real ruble
appreciation arising from the exceptionally strong balance of payments, while monetary and
exchange rate policies have sought to resist such pressures, at the cost of entrenched
inflation. The current drive for a further fiscal relaxation to finance reforms, while the CBR
remains committed to resisting appreciation, suggest that contradictions are rising. Whether
this will cause already existing macroeconomic tensions to intensify will depend on the
environment, notably on oil prices and private demand. Under the current outlook, staff is
concerned that planned policies will permit little if any progress in reducing core inflation
and that real ruble appreciation will continue apace.
51.
Staff believes that fiscal policy should not provide additional stimulus at this
point in the economic cycle. This would strike an appropriate balance between limiting
macroeconomic risks and facilitating the government’s desire to accelerate reforms. It does
not believe that regional and local governments will cut spending and run a surplus, given the
weak framework for controlling spending at lower levels of government. Additional
measures yielding 1–1¼ percent of GDP should, therefore, be included in the draft 2005
budget to ensure an unchanged fiscal stance. Taxes from oil prices above $20 a barrel should
continue to be fully saved in the stabilization fund.
52.
Once cyclical pressures ease, there would be a case for spending more on
carefully elaborated long-term reforms, implying a larger deficit at constant oil prices.
Given the relatively low public sector debt and good prospects for growth, a small deficit
over the full oil price cycle would be sustainable; balancing the budget might be unduly
restrictive, considering that important reforms entail significant budgetary costs. On the other
hand, if private demand continues to grow strongly, fiscal policy would need to be more
restrained and savings in the stabilization fund higher. The challenge will be to maintain a

- 27 -

fiscal stance that at no point in the oil price cycle will require a pro-cyclical tightening. The
appropriate strategy with regard to oil revenues will thus need to be flexible, to allow
changes as circumstances warrant. But if harnessed in support of strong reforms, Russia’s oil
wealth provides the authorities with enviable room for maneuver.
53.
Monetary policy should focus on reducing inflation, unburdened of exchange
rate considerations. With a continued recovery in money demand, there is scope for some
unsterilized interventions while keeping inflation on a downward path, but they should cease
or be scaled back and the ruble allowed to appreciate if they threaten the inflation target.
Making clear to the market that the CBR will focus on inflation and allow ruble appreciation
is likely to increase short-term exchange rate variability and so discourage speculative capital
inflows. Unremunerated deposit requirements will only stem capital inflows temporarily, if at
all, and are not an alternative to a more flexible exchange rate policy.
54.
The early reduction in inflation to 3 percent called for by President Putin is
desirable and achievable. The disinflationary pressures from the inevitable real ruble
appreciation will facilitate this, as will the prospect for continued remonetization. While the
CBR’s headline inflation target of 7½ percent by end-2005 could be more ambitious, the
more important point is that there should be a corresponding decline in core inflation. Using
administered prices to bear down on inflation must be resisted. It merely postpones inevitable
price increases, at considerable cost to resource allocation and structural reforms.
55.
Recent turmoil in the banking sector shows the urgency of strengthening crisis
management tools while pressing ahead with closing unsound banks. It points clearly to
insufficient vigilance in the past, as well as weaknesses in the resolution and crisis
management framework, not to any mistake in the more recent decision to begin closing
unsound banks. It would, therefore, be regrettable if the turmoil was to lead to renewed
forbearance and reluctance to close banks. This is especially important because the recent
decision to extend interim deposit insurance to all banks increases moral hazard, and because
the favorable macroeconomic environment could be masking problems that will surface only
if oil prices drop. The sudden loss of confidence at a time when the environment is good is
thus a sobering reminder of problems that could arise under much less benign circumstances.
It is therefore crucial that the CBR remains unwavering in enforcing sound prudential
standards as it assesses eligibility for participation in the deposit insurance scheme. Without
such resolve, the CBR will in effect have surrendered what it has insisted is the pivotal
instrument in its reform strategy. Further delays will only increase the ultimate cost to the
government of dealing with the problems. While closing banks clearly involves risks, a more
effective crisis management framework, including prompt depositor payout under the deposit
insurance scheme, would help to limit contagion. Staff believes that it is preferable that
negative repercussions surface now while systemic vulnerabilities are manageable. The CBR
will need the full support of the government to improve the soundness of the system.
56.
The government’s reform agenda is generally well-focused. The priority given to
improving the still poor investment climate for small and medium-sized enterprises is
important, if the economy is to diversify away from its dependence on oil and a few large
conglomerates. The priority given to reform of government is particularly important as the

- 28 -

public sector’s large claim on resources and its still pervasive interference in the economy
remain a serious obstacle to investment. Also important is the focus on banking reforms, to
increase the still low level of intermediation; on housing reforms, to reduce severe labor
market bottlenecks; and on early WTO accession, to promote competition and broader
legislative and regulatory reforms.
57.
But there is a gap between intentions and achievements. After a burst of reforms
in 2000–01, the momentum slowed significantly. Most of the objectives on the government’s
agenda are not new, but preparations and implementation have been stalled or progressed
only slowly for some time owing to fierce resistance from vested interests. The reasons are
plain: most of the important achievements to date, such as tax and land reforms, have had
broad popular support; most of the key reforms that lie ahead will involve socially difficult
changes or resistance from powerful stakeholders. In this regard, it is essential that high oil
prices and strong economic growth be viewed not as grounds for complacency but as a
unique opportunity to carry out the structural reforms needed to sustain growth over the
medium term.
58.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation for Russia be conducted on the
standard 12-month cycle.

Projections

1/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; ρ = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms,
g = real GDP growth rate, e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock. ρ increases with an appreciating domestic currency (ε > 0)
and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
4/ High standard deviation of deflator gives aberrant results.

Current account deficit, excluding interest payments
Net non-debt creating capital inflows
Nominal external interest rate (in percent)
Real GDP growth (in percent)
GDP deflator in US dollars (change in percent)

Historical Statistics for Key Variables (1994-2003)

1. Real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator, non-interest current account, and non-debt inflows are at historical average in 2004-2009
2. Nominal interest rate is at historical average plus two standard deviations in 2004 and 2005
3. Real GDP growth is at historical average minus two standard deviations in 2004 and 2005
4. Change in US dollar GDP deflator is at historical average minus two standard deviations in 2004 and 2005 4/
5. Non-interest current account is at historical average minus two standard deviations in 2004 and 2005
6. Combination of 2-5 using one standard deviation shocks
7. One time 30 percent nominal depreciation in 2004

VII. Exchange Arrangements: Managed float. The exchange rate of the ruble is
determined in the interbank foreign exchange market, which was unified on June
29, 1999. The interbank market electronically links exchanges across the country.
The official rate of the ruble is set equal to the previous day's weighted average
rate in the interbank market.

- 39 -

APPENDIX I

The Russian Federation accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3,
and 4 of the IMF Articles of Agreement with effect from June 1, 1996. At the
time of the last Article IV consultation on May 2, 2003, the Russian authorities
still imposed a number of exchange restrictions that are subject to approval under
Article VIII, Sections 2 and 3, and that were not approved by the Executive
Board.
The following exchange restrictions subject to Article VIII were identified at the
time of the 2003 consultation:
•

Conversion Operations through non-residents’ S accounts (exchange
restriction and multiple currency practice). These are special accounts for nonresidents used for GKO-OFZ-related transactions. Before balances arising from
such transactions can be repatriated, fund have to be transferred to a noninterest
bearing transit account for a fixed period. As a result, the repatriation of interest
earnings and other current proceeds from GKO/OFZ investments would be made
with delay and at unfavorable terms.

•

Repatriation restrictions on ruble balances of nonresidents not participating
in the GKO/OFZ novation (exchange restriction and multiple currency practice).
The rules governing the repatriation of ruble balances are similar to those
described above with respect to the S-accounts. They apply to ruble balances
arising from GKO/OFZ investments which matured before December 31, 1998.

•

Restrictions on advance import payments (exchange restriction). The
authorities do not freely permit the making of all advance payments that are
required under valid import contracts.

•

Restrictions on nonresidents’ N-accounts (exchange restriction). These are
nonresident bank accounts used for trade and some bond-related transactions.
Existing restrictions limit the ability of nonresidents to effect moderate amounts
of amortization from the proceeds of bond transactions.

•

Use of a more depreciated exchange rate for repatriation of S-account
balances (exchange restriction and multiple currency practices). Non-residents
who participated in the GKO/OFZ novation are allowed to repatriate part of the
proceeds by purchasing foreign currency in special auctions arranged by the CBR
at a depreciated exchange rate.
The authorities have recently enacted a new Federal Law on Foreign Exchange
Regulation and Foreign Exchange Control and are currently drafting the
implementing regulations. A comprehensive review of the new legal framework
will be required at the end of the legislative overhaul. Staff is working on
assessing the jurisdictional implications of various regulations recently enacted by

- 40 -

the authorities on the existence of the previously identified exchange restrictions
and multiple currency practices.
VIII.

Article IV Consultation: Russia is on the standard 12-month consultation cycle.
The last consultation was concluded on May 2, 2003.

IX. FSAP Participation and ROSCs
Russia participated in the Financial Sector Assessment Program during 2002, and
the FSSA report was discussed by the Board in May 2003, at the time of the 2003
Article IV discussion (IMF Country Report No. 03/147). An MFD TA mission on
key monetary, banking, and related issues took place in April 2004. In addition, a
long-term advisor on banking supervision will be in Moscow until end-2004.
A Fiscal Transparency ROSC mission, headed by Peter Heller (FAD), visited
Moscow in July 2003, and a new Data ROSC module was undertaken by a
mission in October 2003, led by Armida San Jose (STA).

APPENDIX II

RUSSIAN FEDERATION: RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
1.
The current Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) was approved by the Bank’s Board in
June 2002. Overall, the strategy envisages continued emphasis on Bank support to deepen
structural reforms. In particular, the current CAS emphasizes the need to (1) improve the
business environment in order to encourage new firm growth, (2) strengthen public sector
management (including civil service reform, intergovernmental finance reform and support
of judicial reforms), and (3) safeguard against the social and environmental risks of
transition. The World Bank Group’s work in each of these three areas is described in more
detail below.
Improving the business environment and enhancing competition
•
•

•
•

•

Removing administrative barriers to business activity, including monitoring
administrative barriers to small business development and WTO accession advisory
work.
Restructuring priority sectors: preparation underway for lending operations in areas
such as the land cadastre and housing and communal services; and advisory work in
areas such as electricity and gas sector restructuring, railways restructuring, and urban
transport.
Enhancing the protection of property rights, contract enforcement, and
corporate governance, including enterprise support: preparation of a judicial
reform project; and IFC and IBRD work on corporate governance.
Improving financial intermediation: IFC investments and MIGA program;
preparation underway for an IBRD regional banks loan to focus on medium-size
enterprises; FSAP; advisory work on bank supervision, deposit insurance, and
housing finance.
Strengthening Russia’s role in the global knowledge economy: advisory work
focusing on science and technology policy; Global Knowledge Economy strategy for
Russia; reform of the telecommunication sector; and preparation of a science and
technology lending project.

Strengthening public sector management
•
•

Strengthening and modernizing civil service, public administration and judicial
systems: multi-year advisory work, in partnership with DFID and other donors,
focusing on civil service reform; and preparation of a judicial reform project.
Improving public finance: Regional Fiscal Federalism, Treasury Modernization,
Tax Administration and Customs Modernization, and St. Petersburg Economic
Development IBRD loans; WBI work on intergovernmental fiscal relations and urban
and city management capacity building; public expenditure reviews; advisory work
on housing and communal service reform; Country Financial Accountability
Assessment (CFAA); IDF grant on public expenditure management for the Ministry
of Finance.

- 42 -

APPENDIX II

Mitigating social and environmental risks
•
•
•

•

Improving health status, services and finance: TB/AIDS and Health Reform
Implementation loans; advisory services and capacity building in health policy, adult
health, and health insurance.
Improving relevance and delivery of modern educational services: Education
Reform and E-Learning loans; and advisory work on modernizing the education
system.
Mitigating income insecurity, vulnerability and minimizing the risk of poverty:
Northern Restructuring loan and preparation of a child welfare project; multi-year
capacity building program, in partnership with DFID, aimed at poverty monitoring
and policy development; and advisory work on pension reform, child welfare and
targeting of social assistance.
Mitigating environmental risks and improving the environment: Forestry loan
and related advisory services; preparation of loan to modernize meteorological
forecasting; Global Environment Facility (GEF) program; and advisory work on
Environmental Management Systems.

2.
The Bank’s analytical program encompasses a robust program of just-in-time
demand driven policy notes, multi-year technical assistance aimed at building capacity, and
deeper analytical studies. The Bank has also adopted a Programmatic Country Economic
Memorandum (CEM) approach, which addresses a different theme every year in line with
CAS priority areas, rather than aiming at a single report that covers the economy
comprehensively. The draft of the first CEM, which assesses the extent of structural change
in the Russian Federation and its contribution to long-term growth, has recently been issued.9
In this CEM, five connected dimensions of structural change are analyzed:
•
•
•
•
•

Spatial reallocation caused by the legacy of industrialization and urbanization under
central planning;
Reallocation of employment across the economy’s main sectors;
Productivity changes originating from shifts of employment across sectors and from
restructuring within sectors;
Restructuring in the industrial sector; and
Concentration of ownership and its implication for industrial restructuring and
economic performance.

3.
The recently completed Poverty assessment develops comparable survey data to
estimate trends in poverty and inequality in the Russian Federation. The report documents
the success in reducing poverty since 1999 and highlights the challenges facing the country
in reducing poverty by half by 2007. The report stresses the need for a three-pronged
strategy:
9

APPENDIX II

a. promoting broad-based and diversified growth to reduce poverty;
b. targeting interventions to fight the deep pockets of poverty among children, rural
areas and depressed regions; and
c. improving the targeting effectiveness of social programs.
Government priorities and future World Bank Group operations
4.
In his recent public appearances, President Putin has signaled the intention to shift the
focus from macroeconomic stability and growth to sustaining high levels of growth and
reducing poverty and regional disparity. In light of the growing urgency of the reform agenda
covered in the CAS, the government has recently reaffirmed a keen interest in continuing a
strategic partnership with the World Bank Group, to encompass policy advice and technical
assistance, sovereign lending, joint public and private financing, and guarantees.
5.
In light of recent budget surpluses and growing reserves, which have led to the need
to strictly limit foreign borrowing for non-interest budget expenditures, the government is
seeking to selectively use the IBRD’s project design, preparation and monitoring capacity
while limiting loan amounts and maintaining flexibility.
6.
In order to maximize knowledge transfer associated with loans design and
implementation, the IBRD and the government jointly agreed to future sovereign borrowing
in three areas:
•
•
•

public infrastructure projects of national importance;
institutional strengthening of public administration; and
social infrastructure.

7.
The priority considerations for the future lending program are to increase the amount
of government co-financing and to develop new lending instruments and mechanisms, which
will allow for tailoring resource flows to the budgetary situation over an extended period of
time.

- 44 -

APPENDIX III

RUSSIAN FEDERATION: STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
Russia has a reasonably comprehensive and timely statistical database, but difficulties
remain in terms of the data accuracy. State and private enterprise activities are measured
through forms sent to firms included in enterprise registers, with sample surveys increasingly
replacing full-count collections. The authorities are generally cooperative in reporting data to
the Fund, mainly through the resident representative office, and during missions. Data are
provided on a timely basis, albeit with a few exceptions. Russia produces a wide range of
regular, timely publications on financial and economic statistics. The authorities report data
for the Fund’s International Financial Statistics (IFS), Government Finance Statistics
Yearbook, the Direction of Trade Statistics, and the Balance of Payments Statistics
Yearbook.
2.
A draft ROSC module on data dissemination practices was prepared in 1999–2000,
but never published. A new ROSC data module was prepared in October 2003, and on
April 25, 2004, the authorities approved the publication of the report on the IMF website.
3.
Recent improvements in data dissemination practices have moved Russia closer to
subscription to the SDDS (see below). The Ministry of Finance contacted STA on
April 28, 2004 to reiterate Russia's commitment to subscribe to the SDDS. Russia has not yet
nominated a National SDDS Coordinator and STA is awaiting an official letter from the
authorities in this regard.
National accounts
4.
The State Statistics Committee (Goskomstat) compiles and publishes quarterly and
annual national accounts data on a timely basis, using the 1993 System of National Accounts.
Source data are obtained from surveys of businesses and households, including financial
surveys of businesses and employment surveys of households, and are supplemented by
administrative data. There has been much effort to improve coverage, but further progress is
needed in covering small and medium enterprises. The estimates of gross domestic product
(GDP) are compiled by type of economic activity and expenditure category; however, the
estimates by type of activity are considered more accurate. The statistical discrepancy
between the production and expenditure approaches is generally no more than 2 percent,
which is acceptable by international standards. The data are also presented by income
category. Estimates of the financial account by institutional sector are not compiled although
these estimates are needed.
5.
The delay in finalizing a modern statistics lawrequiring firms to provide data and
with realistic penalties for noncompliance, together with a guarantee of confidentialityis an
impediment to further improvement of national accounts data.
6.
The authorities do not publish separate data on export and import volumes. Revisions
to the data are not flagged when the data are disseminated. As a result, it is difficult for users,
including the Fund, to maintain any form of consistent time series.

- 45 -

APPENDIX III

Prices
8.
Goskomstat compiles a good quality national consumer price index (CPI), developed
with Fund technical assistance. Since January 2003, as a result of achieving moderate
inflation in the recent years, Goskomstat has stopped the weekly publication of headline
inflation and continued only with monthly reports; in addition, Goskomstat has started the
publication of monthly core inflation data. Further improvements could be made on the basis
of a new household budget survey—which has been under consideration for some time—and
by the current efforts to improve the treatment of seasonal items in the index. World Bank
and TACIS assistance is available in these areas. Goskomstat also publishes a producer price
index. The State Customs Committee has initiated the development of foreign trade price
indexes.
9.
Since November 2003, the monthly CPI and PPI are presented in two formats: (i) as
an index using annual average prices for 1995 as the reference (1995=100) and (ii) as a
percentage of a previous month (the previous month and the same month in the previous
year). However, data on the basic components of the CPI and PPI are not readily available in
time series format, and the weights of the CPI and PPI components are not disclosed,
rendering time series analysis difficult.
Government finance statistics data
10.
The staff is provided with monthly information on revenues, expenditures, and
financing of the federal and local governments and quarterly information on revenues,
expenditures, and financing of extrabudgetary funds. The published functional
classification of expenditure differs slightly from international standards. Expenditure data,
classified by economic type, need improvement. Presently, they are compiled with a long
delay on an annual basis, with a publication lag of one year. Data on domestic and external
federal debt are compiled monthly, but are made public only in summary form on an annual
basis; in addition, there is no unified debt monitoring and reporting system. In the context of
a work program for statistical improvement agreed with STA, there have been ongoing
improvements in the coverage and quality of GFS data, although expenditure data remain
poor. The reform of budgetary accounting is well advanced. Its objectives include the
introduction of accrual accounting for the whole of government. The latest data provided for
publication in the GFS Yearbook for 2002 were reported on an accrual basis, in accordance
with the methodology of the Manual on Government Finance Statistics 2001. The Treasury
has been reporting aggregate government finance data for publication in IFS on a cash basis
since April 1996.
Monetary statistics
11.
Monetary data are reasonably comprehensive and generally in accordance with
international standards. The data ROSC mission in 2003 identified the following
methodological issues: (1) the scope of monetary statistics did not include financial
institutions issuing deposit substitutes, such as mutual funds and financial companies, and

- 46 -

APPENDIX III

credit institutions in the process of liquidation; (2) classification and sectorization were in
line with the methodological guidelines, except that securities repurchase operations of credit
institutions with nonresidents (currently at insignificant levels) were not treated as
collateralized loans, and financial derivatives (which are at an initial stage of development in
Russia) were not included in the instrument classification; and (3) the basis of recording
broadly followed methodological recommendations, except that monetary gold and securities
for investment purposes were not valued at current market prices. In addition, accrued
interest was not included in the underlying instrument. Following the data ROSC, the
authorities included all unoperational credit institutions in the coverage of the monetary
statistics and reclassified their deposits as restricted deposits. The Central Bank of Russia
(CBR) intends to revise further its compilation procedures to conform fully with the
guidelines of the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual 2000.
12.
Analytical accounts for the monetary authorities and commercial banks are reported
for publication in IFS with a lag of one month. Timely interest rate data are available.
External sector statistics
13.
The balance of payments is compiled on the basis of the Fund’s Balance of Payments
Manual (Fifth Edition). In cooperation with the Fund, significant progress has been made
with regard to balance of payments statistics. More detailed data have been published and
new data sources have been developed. Though significant improvements have been made to
enhance the quality of balance of payments statistics, there is further scope to improve the
coverage of certain components of the current and the capital and financial account. There is
especially also scope to improve the detail of data available to the public especially on the
financial account to analyze the relatively complex flows.
14.
The State Customs Committee needs to substantially improve the coverage and
valuation of exports and imports. Merchandise imports data published by the State Customs
Service are subject to large adjustments for under recording, especially for “shuttle trade” by
individuals, smuggling, and under-valuation. Large, persistent differences between partner
country and customs data on imports remain, although statistical agencies are seeking to
reconcile the data with those of partner countries. The CBR has developed a methodology for
calculating components of export and import transactions unrecorded by the customs
authorities. Goskomstat needs to improve the coverage and quality of surveys on direct
investment, and trade in services including travel. The CBR has moved toward direct data
collection to address these limitations.
15.
Russia has began disseminating the data template on international reserves and
foreign currency liquidity. However, published historic series on reserves have not been
corrected for changes in definitions. Headline data on reserves are reported to the Fund and
the markets on a weekly basis with a four-business day lag. The Fund receives additional
detail on reserves and reserve liabilities through the central bank balance sheet, but this is not
as comprehensive as the reserve template.

- 47 -

APPENDIX III

16.
Quarterly external debt data are now published by sector, maturity, instrument, and
currency, with a lag of one quarter as prescribed by the SDDS. Moreover, while
improvements have been made, there are a number of gaps in data, notably the lack of a debt
service schedule. Underlying balance of payments data also lack information on gross
payments, for example, for the banking system, which is necessary to monitor liquidity risk.
There is also a need to monitor corporate sector off-balance sheet obligations and more
generally, information on interest and exchange rate exposure of the sector.
17.
The CBR has commenced publishing an annual international investment position for
all sectors with data starting in 2001. The international investment position for the banking
sector is now available on a quarterly basis.
Special Data Dissemination Standard
18.
Significant progress has been made towards meeting SDDS dissemination
requirements. Goskomstat, the MOF, and the CBR are already following the SDDS metadata
framework to disseminate information regarding their statistical practices, and Russia’s data
dissemination practices currently meet most of the SDDS requirements. During the ROSC
mission, the authorities disseminated, for the first time, international reserves data using the
Fund’s Data Template on International Reserves and Foreign Currency Liquidity. After the
ROSC mission, Goskomstat published the price statistics in index format (1995=100) on its
website, and the CBR disseminated the analytical accounts of the monetary authorities with
the timeliness prescribed by the SDDS, beginning with data for the reference period of
October 2003.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
RUSSIAN FEDERATION
Staff Report for the 2004 Article IV Consultation
Supplementary Information
Prepared by European Department
Approved by Michael Deppler and Carlos Muñiz
August 30, 2004
1.
This supplement contains information on recent economic developments in Russia
that has become available since the circulation of the staff report for the Article IV
consultation.
2.
The recent rise in oil prices and attendant changes to the WEO oil price
projections—to $37 a barrel in 2004 and 2005—have strengthened the balance of
payment and fiscal outlook, but are otherwise expected to have only limited
macroeconomic implications:
•

As to the balance of payments, the current account surplus in 2004 is likely to be
higher than previously expected, by perhaps 1½ percent of GDP, but higher private
capital outflows over the summer, as a result of recent turmoil in the banking system
and uncertainties arising from the legal proceedings against Yukos, suggest that the
overall balance of payments position will not be notably affected this year. Looking
to next year and beyond, higher current account surpluses (by 2–3 percent of GDP a
year) are expected to translate into an accelerated increase in foreign reserves
provided the authorities move forcefully to strengthen the banking system and prove
even-handed and transparent in enforcing tax legislation and the rule of law more
generally, as discussed in the staff report.

•

As to the public sector, higher oil revenues will be fully saved in the oil stabilization
fund in 2004. Reflecting mainly higher oil prices, but also payment of back-taxes by
Yukos, the draft 2005 budget submitted to the Duma on August 26 assumes that
revenues will be about ⅔ percentage points of GDP higher than projected at the time
of the mission. Half of these additional revenues have been reflected in higher
spending, and the 2005 budget deficit on a constant oil price basis will, therefore, be
about ⅓ percent of GDP higher than previously projected, raising the total fiscal
stimulus to 1⅓–1½ percent of GDP next year. While savings in the oil stabilization
fund are supposed to cease once the cap of Rub 500 billion is reached—which under
the revised oil price assumption could happen late this year—statements made by the
president and the minister of finance at the time of the budget submission suggest that

-2-

any revenues arising from Urals oil prices above the revised budgetary assumption of
$28 per barrel will be saved.
•

Recent developments do not suggest any need to change the projections for GDP and
inflation in 2004. A recent upward revision by the authorities of their GDP forecast
for 2004 has brought this forecast closer to the staff’s. As to 2005, while oil export
earnings have been revised up by 1½ percent of GDP, staff has raised its forecast for
GDP growth by only ¼ percentage point, reflecting the likelihood that much of the
windfall will be saved, especially as about 80 percent of higher oil sector earnings are
taxed at the current level of oil prices. Headline inflation rose slightly in July, to
10.4 percent, and the ruble remained broadly stable against the dollar. The authorities
have narrowed the target range for end-year inflation in 2005 to its upper half, from
6½–8½ percent to 7½–8½ percent.

3.
Regarding other developments, the situation in the banking sector remained
calm during August. Amendments to strengthen the bank bankruptcy law, which were
approved by the Duma at end-July and by the Federation Council on August 8, were signed
into law by the president on August 20. Banks’ balance sheet data for July, needed for a
fuller assessment of recent developments, are not yet available.
4.
Finance Minister Kudrin indicated last week that Russia would like to replace its
Paris Club debts with marketable securities. This issue is likely to be discussed by Paris
Club creditors once the Russian authorities have made specific proposals. Staff will be in a
position to provide a more detailed assessment once the specifics are known.
5.
The additional information available since the circulation of the staff report does
not alter the general thrust of the staff appraisal. Staff continues to believe that there
should be no fiscal stimulus at this point in the economic cycle, whereas the draft 2005
budget submitted to the Duma entails a somewhat larger fiscal stimulus than projected at the
time of the mission. More importantly, with oil prices now well above the assumption
underlying the 2005 budget, staff views a policy of fully saving oil revenues over and above
what is assumed in the budget as key to the authorities’ ability to manage the macroeconomic
challenges associated with very high oil prices.

IMF Concludes 2004 Article IV Consultation with the Russian Federation
On September 1, 2004, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with the Russian Federation.1
Background
The macroeconomic environment continues to be favorable, with strong GDP growth,
moderate inflation and large current account and fiscal surpluses. The oil-driven boom is,
however, leading to growing macroeconomic tensions. While the near-term outlook is strong,
based on current projections for oil prices, and external vulnerabilities are generally low, recent
nervousness in the banking sector and uncertainty related to the Yukos affair highlight the
fragility of confidence.
GDP growth rose to 7–7½ percent in 2003 and the first half of 2004, and became better
balanced. The acceleration was mainly due to higher investment, but also to increased oil
export volumes. Growth continued to depend heavily on the favorable external environment, in
particular high oil prices, but recent increases in investment were also related to political
stability, generally sound macroeconomic policies, and some structural reforms, suggesting that
GDP is increasingly deriving strength from domestic factors as well.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. This PIN summarizes the views of the Executive Board as expressed during
the Executive Board discussion based on the staff report.

-2-

Macroeconomic tensions have increased, however, as growth has risen and the balance
of payments strengthened. While headline inflation declined to 12 percent at end-2003 and
further during the first half of 2004, this was mainly due to administered price restraint; core
inflation has become entrenched at 10–11 percent over the past two years. Tightening labor
markets have added to inflationary pressures. With inflation still high relative to competitors and
the ruble broadly stable in nominal effective terms, the pace of real ruble appreciation has
increased to nearly 10 percent over the past year.
The balance of payments has strengthened further. Despite higher imports related to rapid
demand growth and real appreciation, the external current account surplus has remained at
8-9 percent of GDP during the past two years, supported by high world commodity prices.
Meanwhile, net private capital outflows declined substantially in 2003, reflecting higher
corporate and banking sector borrowing as well as some reversal of foreign currency
substitution. In the first half of 2004, net outflows increased, with volatility reflecting periodic
uncertainty linked to the Yukos affair, prospects for global interest rates, and perceived
changes in the central bank’s intervention and exchange rate strategy. Nonetheless, reserves
accumulation continued, even as the banking system was hit by turmoil in July. Gross
international reserves stood at about $88.5 billion (over seven months of imports) at end-July.
Public external debt, net of reserves, has fallen close to zero, compared with $140 billion in
1998.
The Central Bank of Russia (CBR) has intervened heavily to slow ruble appreciation over
the past 18 months. The interventions were largely unsterilized, causing a surge in money
growth during 2003. Rapid broad money growth, partly reflecting conversion of cash foreign
currency holdings into ruble deposits, fuelled growth in credit to the economy of around 44
percent in the year to June 2004.
The trend toward fiscal relaxation is continuing, notwithstanding some tightening in the
2004 budget. Despite higher oil prices and strong economic growth, the general government
surplus increased by only ½ percent of GDP, to 1 percent of GDP, in 2003. This represents an
underlying loosening of the fiscal stance at constant oil prices of about 1 percent of GDP. The
2004 budget envisions a moderate tightening, to be achieved through postponement of noninterest expenditure increases, but plans for the 2005 budget suggest that this will be reversed,
in response to growing pressures to spend more of the oil revenue windfall on tax cuts and
expenditure reforms.
Progress on structural reform has been limited. The two major reforms in 2003 relate to the
financial system. The law on foreign exchange regulation introduced a far-reaching liberalization
of capital flows. It allows the imposition of unremunerated deposit requirements on capital flows,
and the CBR decided to introduce such requirements from August 2004. Additionally, legislation
was passed to introduce mandatory insurance of household deposits.
Increased regulatory vigilance in recent months has triggered nervousness in the private
banking sector. The CBR has begun to assess applications by banks for entry into the deposit

-3insurance system and has strengthened enforcement of prudential standards and
Anti-Money Laundering/Combating Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) legislation. Confidence
was shaken when the CBR withdrew the license of a bank in May 2004 for AML/CFT violations,
leading to a liquidity squeeze and deposit runs at some banks. Although the situation has since
calmed down, reflecting prompt actions by the CBR, confidence remains fragile.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors commended the authorities’ good management of the economy, and the
strengthening of GDP growth and the balance of payments, driven by high oil prices, increasing
oil export volumes, and strong domestic demand. They were pleased that growth was becoming
broader based and better balanced, and that key social indicators were improving. However,
Directors advised that, with a buoyant economy, fiscal policies should not be eased and
monetary policy should focus more on controlling inflation than on resisting nominal
appreciation. To maintain competitiveness and diversify the economy, they also saw a need to
invigorate the pace of structural reforms.
Given the strong oil price outlook, and Russia’s large international reserves and low public debt,
Directors expected that growth would remain robust over the near term and that external
vulnerabilities would likely remain low. They cautioned, however, that further turmoil in the
banking system could damage confidence.
Directors commended the achievement of a fiscal surplus in recent years and the establishment
of an oil stabilization fund. They cautioned, however, that fiscal policy should not provide
additional stimulus at this point in the economic cycle, and viewed the authorities’ plans to relax
fiscal policy in 2005 as exacerbating pressures for real ruble appreciation, arising from the
exceptionally strong balance of payments, and increasing inflationary pressures.
They recommended increasing the cap on the collection of windfall oil revenues in the oil
stabilization fund and considering the use of some revenues in the fund to reduce debt.
Directors recognized, however that, once cyclical pressures eased, there could be a case for
spending more on carefully elaborated long-term fiscal structural reforms, including on health
care and pension reform, and on public infrastructure. They welcomed the authorities’ plans to
restructure and monetize the system of in-kind benefits, and to judiciously reduce the social tax
rate, accompanied by any necessary measures to ensure achievement of the broader fiscal
objectives. They concurred on the importance of further development of regional and local fiscal
capacity.
Directors agreed that the central bank needed to clarify the two competing objectives of
controlling inflation and managing the exchange rate. They highlighted their concern over the
emphasis on stemming real ruble appreciation, because, in their view, monetary policy could
not target the real exchange rate, except in the short run, and the efforts to resist appreciation
had resulted in inflation becoming entrenched at a relatively high level. Most Directors felt that
the cost to the economy of high inflation was not sufficiently recognized, while the cost of ruble
appreciation was exaggerated. They urged the central bank to allow more nominal exchange
rate flexibility, to facilitate a reduction of interest spreads and discourage speculative capital

-4inflows, and to take advantage of the disinflationary impact of nominal appreciation. They also
highlighted the need to strengthen the independence of the central bank.
Directors welcomed steps to liberalize the capital account. Most Directors saw unremunerated
deposit requirements as, at best, a temporary measure to stem capital inflows and advised the
authorities to consider the experience of other countries where such requirements have raised
the cost of capital, especially for small- and medium-sized enterprises. It was felt that deposit
requirements could help limit large inflows of volatile short-term capital to weak banks.
However, Directors took the view that deposit requirements should be temporary, reserved to
deal with exceptionally large and volatile inflows, and should not be used to stem sustained
pressure for ruble appreciation.
Directors stressed that recent turmoil in the banking sector demonstrated the urgency of
strengthening prudential supervision and crisis management tools, while pressing ahead with
closing unsound banks. They commended the central bank for taking prompt actions to calm
the situation, including halving reserve requirements and extending interim household deposit
insurance to all banks. However, they noted that extension of deposit insurance could increase
moral hazard, and encouraged the central bank to be unwavering in enforcing sound prudential
standards. Directors urged the authorities to give the central bank strong political support and
facilitate the development of more effective instruments for further strengthening banking
supervision and weeding out problem banks. In this regard, Directors welcomed the prompt
action by the Duma to strengthen the bank bankruptcy law. They also encouraged further
development of a private banking sector and stronger action to counter money laundering.
Directors noted that the authorities’ structural reform plans were well focused and progress had
been made in some areas, including pension reform. However they thought that these plans
would benefit from more emphasis on specifics, as overall implementation had slowed.
They encouraged the authorities not to view high oil prices and strong growth as grounds for
complacency but, rather, as a unique opportunity to carry out the structural reforms needed to
sustain growth over the medium term. They emphasized the importance of diversifying the
economy and reducing reliance on natural resources, and in this regard, welcomed the priority
given to encouraging domestic and foreign direct investment and improving the investment
climate for small- and medium-sized enterprises. They also supported the focus on public
administration reform, banking reform, and housing reform, and underscored the benefits of
liberalizing trade and early WTO accession. They underscored the need to improve governance
and the rule of law, and to resolve successfully the Yukos affair. They also emphasized the
importance of reforming the energy sector, breaking up inefficient monopolies, and improving
labor market flexibility.
Directors welcomed the findings of recently conducted Reports on the Observance of Standards
and Codes modules on data and fiscal transparency, and the authorities’ decision to publish
these reports. They noted that Russia’s statistical database is mostly adequate for surveillance
and that dissemination practices meet most of the Special Data Dissemination Standard
requirements, and welcomed the authorities’ intention to subscribe to the SDDS. They also
commended the progress made in strengthening fiscal transparency and financial management.
