IMF Executive Board Concludes 2016 Article IV Consultation with Spain

On January 27, 2017, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation1 with Spain.
The economy has continued its recovery and imbalances are falling. Real GDP expanded by
3.2 percent in 2015 with the same growth rate expected for 2016, despite a prolonged period of
domestic political uncertainty. Almost 1.1 million jobs were created over the past two years. The
rebound in private consumption, exports, and investment, aided by past reforms, has remained
the main driver of growth. The European Central Bank’s accommodative monetary policy, low
oil prices, as well as fiscal relaxation have also provided support. The current account is
projected to record its fourth consecutive annual surplus. Private sector balance sheets have
further strengthened, while public debt remains high at about 100 percent of GDP remains high.
Real GDP growth is projected to moderate to 2.3 percent in 2017.
Earlier reforms and confidence-enhancing measures have laid the ground for this rebound. In
particular, wage moderation and greater labor market flexibility have helped the economy regain
competitiveness and have contributed to strong job creation. Together with banking sector
reforms they have made the Spanish economy more resilient.
Nevertheless, unemployment remains very high at around 19 percent, with about half of the
unemployed having been jobless for more than a year. Labor market duality is still widespread,
and productivity growth is relatively weak. At the same time, high public debt, pockets of overindebtedness in the private sector, and the still large negative net international investment
position leave the economy vulnerable to shocks.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors welcomed Spain’s impressive economic recovery, strong job creation, and
rapid decline in imbalances. Directors recognized that decisive policies and structural reforms
had contributed to the solid rebound. They noted that while the economy is now more resilient,
adjustments are incomplete and structural weaknesses persist, including high unemployment,
elevated public debt, and weak productivity growth.
Directors emphasized the need to preserve the past reform efforts and economic performance by
sustaining the policy momentum and advancing structural reforms. They agreed that immediate
attention should focus on priority areas where there is broad political support. These include
implementing more effective active labor market policies to lower long-term and youth
unemployment, reforming regional public finances to safeguard overall public finances, and
strengthening innovation and education policies to lift productivity.
In light of the elevated public debt and structural fiscal loosening in the past two years, Directors
called for a resumption of gradual but credible fiscal consolidation to put debt firmly on a
downward path. A growth- and job-friendly adjustment would need to rely more on indirect
taxes, while shielding vulnerable groups. Directors commended the authorities for the revenueenhancing measures adopted for 2017. They highlighted that advancing expenditure
rationalization could also contribute to fiscal adjustment but should not come at the expense of
targeted incentives for employment creation and productivity growth. Directors underscored the
need to reform the regional fiscal framework with a view to improving regions’ incentives and
capacities to comply with their fiscal targets.
While recognizing the strong employment growth, Directors stressed that reducing the still very
high unemployment, in particular long-term and youth joblessness, remains a priority. They
welcomed ongoing efforts to strengthen active labor market programs and encouraged further
improvements, particularly through more effective coordination with regional governments.
They recommended consolidating hiring subsidies into better-targeted schemes, particularly for
low-skilled and long-term unemployed. Directors also called on the authorities to fully address
the long-standing issue of labor market duality.
Directors encouraged the authorities to take steps to enhance medium-term growth prospects,
particularly by strengthening conditions for small and medium-sized enterprises to grow and
raise productivity. They called for faster implementation of the Market Unity Law, advancement
of the liberalization of professional services, enhancing R&D investment, improving access to
non-bank financing for frontier innovation, and revisiting size-contingent regulations.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers
used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

Directors commended the strengthening of bank balance sheets. To further enhance the banking
system’s ability to withstand shocks and facilitate sufficient credit provision as credit demand
picks up, Directors encouraged continued efforts to ensure adequate provisioning, increase
efficiency, boost non-interest income, and further increase high-quality capital. They looked
forward to the upcoming 2017 FSAP which will review the overall financial stability architecture
and provide guidance on further enhancing the financial system’s resilience.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
January 10, 2017

KEY ISSUES
Context. The recovery is strong and imbalances are falling fast, aided by past reforms.
External tailwinds and expansionary fiscal policy also buoyed activity and job creation.
The economy is now more resilient but adjustments are incomplete and structural
weaknesses persist. In particular, high unemployment, elevated public debt and
shortcomings in the regional fiscal framework, feeble productivity growth, and the still
large negative net international investment position pose policy challenges.
Policies. Preserving past reform achievements is of utmost importance, but Spain needs
to go farther if it is to sustain the dynamic economic performance. Given the fragmented
parliament, immediate attention should focus on priority areas for which the reform
needs and objectives are broadly shared: enhancing active labor market policies to lower
long-term and youth unemployment, reforming regional public finances to safeguard
public finances, and strengthening innovation and education policies to lift productivity.
Additional labor and product market reforms need to enhance such a strategy.


Fiscal policy: Resumption of gradual fiscal consolidation would ensure that debt is
firmly put on a downward path. A growth and job-friendly adjustment would need to
rely more on indirect taxes. Reforms of the regional fiscal framework should aim to
improve regions’ incentive and capacity to comply with fiscal targets.



Labor market: Enhancing the effectiveness of active labor market programs (ALMP)
is critical. Hiring subsidies could be consolidated to better-targeted schemes,
particularly for low-skilled and long-term unemployed. At the same time, the longstanding issue of labor market duality is still to be fully addressed.



Structural reforms: Creating conditions for SMEs to grow and raise productivity call
for implementing faster the Market Unity Law, advancing the liberalization of
professional services, enhancing R&D investment, improving access to non-bank
financing for frontier innovation, and revisiting size-contingent regulations.



Banking sector: Continuing to ensure adequate provisioning, further improving
efficiency gains—possibly through mergers—, boosting non-interest income, and
further increasing high-quality capital would enhance the banking system’s ability to
withstand shocks, and facilitate sufficient credit provision as credit demand picks up.

CONTEXT
1.
The recovery is strong and imbalances are falling fast, helped by past reforms. Real
GDP and employment growth remain well above euro area averages, despite a prolonged period
of domestic political uncertainty. Spain continues to reap the benefits of the major financial sector
and labor market reforms taken during the crisis years, which in combination with external tailwinds
and expansionary fiscal policy have buoyed activity. The Spanish economy has regained
competitiveness, employment creation has been swift, and private sector balance sheets have
continued to strengthen.
2.
But adjustments are not yet complete and structural problems persist. Unemployment,
particularly long-term and youth joblessness, is still painfully high, while temporary work remains
wide-spread. Without a boost to the low productivity of Spanish enterprises and greater efficiency
and inclusiveness of the labor market, growth is set to ease and structural unemployment risks
staying exceptionally high. At the same time, elevated public debt, lingering debt overhang in parts
of the private sector, and the large negative net international investment position continue to leave
the economy vulnerable to shocks.

Political fragmentation and reform fatigue have delayed fiscal adjustment and
impeded deeper structural efforts. The priorities of the new minority government, which took
office with a 10-month delay, are preserving earlier reform achievements and meeting short-term
fiscal commitments under the Stability and Growth Pact. However, rekindling the momentum for
structural reforms and medium-term fiscal consolidation will be challenging (Appendix I), despite
broad-based agreement on reform needs in areas such as regional public finances, active labor
market policies (ALMP), and education and innovation policies.

disposable income, lower oil prices, the
depreciation of the euro, and the ECB’s quantitative easing (Box 1). A relaxation of the fiscal stance
has also provided stimulus to the economy. After returning to positive territory in September,
headline inflation jumped to 0.7 percent in October and November (y-o-y), reflecting higher oil
prices and moderate increases in food and services prices (Figure 1).
5.
Job creation has remained strong but further reducing unemployment—especially for
those long out of work—is a key challenge. Employment has been growing at more than
3 percent annually with almost 1.1 million jobs created over the past two years, supported by wage
moderation and labor market reforms (see Annex I). Real unit labor costs have been growing at a
modest pace (0.5 percent y-o-y in 2016: Q1–Q3). Temporary contracts still make up the largest share
of new jobs (about 53 percent) even though there is some evidence that the share of permanent
hires is picking up (Figure 2). Although the unemployment rate has declined by 8 percentage points
from its peak three years ago, it remains very high at just under 19 percent; the rate for Spain’s
youth is more than double that level. Almost 50 percent of the unemployed have been jobless for
over a year, a large share of them being low-skilled and previously employed in the construction
sector. Prospects for this group appear particularly grim, with unemployment exit rates significantly
lower than the average and higher risks of poverty and social exclusion. In contrast, exit rates for the
short-term unemployed (less than a year) have improved by more than 5 percentage points since
2013. The ongoing positive labor market dynamics have been critical in starting to recoup some of
the fall in living standards and reverse the rise in inequality caused by the crisis (Box 2).

The private sector has further deleveraged while access to credit has improved. New
bank lending has picked up in line with the strong economic recovery, in particular consumer credit,
lending to agriculture, manufacturing, and non-real-estate services, but total credit growth is still
negative (Figure 3). With private debt-to-GDP about 65 percentage points below its 2007 peak level,
excess leverage is now concentrated mostly in a few corporate sectors for which the loan repayment
capacity is still weak (construction and real estate) and in households (Figures 4–5). Improving profit
margins since the crisis have helped the corporate sector finance new investment with retained
earnings, along with more debt financing by large corporates. Households proceeded in rebuilding
their net wealth positions and further reduced their bank debt. As a result, demand for loans is still
weak, but credit supply—underpinned by a stronger banking system—is broadly supportive of the
economic recovery, with financial conditions having eased further.

Bank balance sheets strengthened further amid new challenges. Asset quality has
improved, but banks still hold sizeable nonperforming loans (NPLs), though much lower than in
some EU countries. The NPL ratio stood at 9.5 percent for business in Spain at end-June 2016, which
is 4.2 percentage points below its peak in 2013, despite the contraction of overall lending (Figure 6).
Banks have also continued to build up capital buffers raising the regulatory capital ratio to
14.6 percent by end-June 2016. Although Spanish banks’ holding of common equity tier-1 (CET1)
still lags that of European peers, they are generally less leveraged than their European peers thanks
to the higher risk weight intensity. Reduced profitability over the four quarters (2015:Q3–2016:Q2)
indicates that the operating conditions for banks have become more challenging, amid low interest

rates, still elevated levels of legacy assets, continued deleveraging, and stiffened pricing competition
for new loans.1 Meanwhile, Spain’s two largest banks have benefited from their globally-diversified
earnings mainly accruing from retail banking, performing relatively well among major European
banks during the period of market stress earlier this year. However, more difficult economic
conditions outside Spain—in particular in Latin America, Turkey, and the U.K. where large Spanish
banks have subsidiaries—risk lowering group-wide profits and their contributions to group-wide
capital (Box 3).

In 2015, the overall deficit significantly exceeded the excessive deficit procedure (EDP) target of
4.2 percent of GDP. In particular, regional governments (1 percent of GDP) and social security
(0.7 percent of GDP) underperformed, but this was partly compensated by over-compliance of
the central and the local (i.e. municipal) governments. At the regional level, capital, health and
education spending outpaced the budget plan. Moreover, the reclassification of regional public
private partnerships (0.2 percent of GDP) into the public sector, despite stricter reporting
requirements introduced in recent years that were expected to prevent such surprises, revealed
weaknesses in public financial management. The Council of EU Finance Ministers found that
Spain did not take effective action to reduce its excessive fiscal deficit in 2015 but cancelled
potential sanctions.



For 2016, staff projects the fiscal deficit to decline to 4.5 percent of GDP in 2016, thus putting
the new EDP deficit target of 4.6 percent of GDP within reach. The projected deficit is nearly
1 percentage point higher than budgeted and envisaged in Spain’s April 2016 Stability Program
(3.6 percent of GDP). Public debt remained high, at just under 100 percent of GDP.

9.
The current account registered another surplus. In 2015, the external current account
surplus increased by ½ percentage point to 1.4 percent of GDP and it is expected to be around
2 percent of GDP in 2016. While non-oil imports accelerated further as domestic demand rose, the
external surplus increased on the back of lower oil prices and interest rates. Sustained and healthy

The authorities stressed reform achievements and progress made in reducing
imbalances, both having contributed to the solid growth performance. They highlighted major
improvements in employment, bank balance sheet cleansing, deleveraging, credit allocation, and
external competitiveness. They emphasized that structural changes of the Spanish export sector are
supporting sustained current account surpluses and, for the first time in decades, are considered to
be compatible with strong growth. While broadly agreeing that the large negative NIIP remains a
source of vulnerability, they stressed its gradual improvement over the last years as well as
additional risk-mitigating factors such as equity holding and external debt held by the Bank of
Spain.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
12.
After a strong performance this year, growth is expected to moderate next year but
stay well above the euro area average. Real GDP is projected to expand by 3.2 and 2.3 percent in
2016 and 2017, respectively, with domestic demand continuing to be the main driving force. Brexit is
estimated to lower Spain’s real GDP by about 0.3 percentage point through 2018 via confidence and
trade channels. As the external tailwinds dissipate and fiscal policy envisages some tightening in
2017, real GDP growth is set to ease. Small positive spillovers in 2017 from potentially higher global
growth on the back of a possible US fiscal stimulus are expected to more than offset somewhat
tighter financial conditions, with Spain’s 10-year government bond yields having risen by 19 basis
points from end-October to end-December. Households are expected to further bolster their overall
net wealth position and raise their still depressed savings ratio, implying a deceleration in
consumption growth, though household deleveraging is set to moderate (see Box 1 in Country
Report 15/232). Investment growth is also projected to slow with the unwinding of temporary
factors but as the corporate debt overhang continues to shrink, prospects for investment and
productivity growth should brighten somewhat.2 As a result, credit growth is projected to turn
positive but remain subdued. A small positive contribution from net exports is forecast for this and
next year as exports continue to benefit from improved competitiveness and better partner-country
prospects while import growth should moderate in line with domestic demand and higher public
and private savings. The current account surplus is projected to rise a bit this year and stabilize at
around 2 percent of GDP, allowing for a gradual reduction of the NIIP. Inflation will likely pick up
gradually to an estimated 1.2 percent in 2017, in line with the projected gradual recovery of oil
prices and euro area inflation.

Spain’s reform achievements are paying off but need to be enhanced to uphold high
and job-rich growth over the medium term. In particular, the 2012 labor market reforms have

result, once tailwinds dissipate growth is set to slow and converge in the medium term to its
potential rate of around 1½ percent.
14.
Risks to the outlook are tilted to the downside. External risks to the outlook include weak
growth in key advanced and emerging economies or a significant slowdown in the latter, as well as
uncertainty about the potentially protracted negotiations of a post-Brexit arrangement
(Appendix III). Moreover, the recent erosion of support for European institutions and increased
protectionist sentiment in many economies is a risk to international integration, trade, and
coordination. Slowing external demand would generally weigh down Spanish activity through the
trade channel, while weaker macroeconomic conditions in Latin America would mostly be
transmitted through financial channels, including through potentially reduced profits of Spain’s
global banks (Box 3). Sharply tighter or more volatile global financial conditions could renew
sovereign and financial sector stress via loss of market confidence, upward pressure on private
sector lending rates, and resulting bank balance sheet effects, but the ECB’s policies mitigate against
excessive financial volatility and private sector balances have strengthened.3 Domestically, reversal of
past policy achievements could hurt market confidence, dampen investment, and weigh down
medium-term growth prospects. Weak implementation of fiscal commitments could further delay
the reduction of fiscal vulnerabilities, limiting the room for maneuver in case of future shocks.
Authorities’ Views
15.
The authorities broadly agreed with staff on the outlook and balance of risks, stressing
their commitment to preserve reforms in the face of pressure for their reversal. The Bank of
Spain’s projections for real GDP growth and medium-term growth potential are similar to staff’s,
while the government expects somewhat stronger growth dynamics over the medium term. High
unemployment and low productivity are considered to be the key structural challenges. Therefore,
the authorities recognized that there is no scope for complacency.

POLICY AGENDA
16.
Sustaining the strong momentum of the recovery while proceeding to make the
economy more inclusive and robust to shocks requires continued broad-based policy efforts.
Priorities include (i) a return to gradual, credible, and growth-friendly fiscal consolidation;
(ii) enhanced labor market performance, particularly by assisting the long-term unemployed and
young; (iii) improved productivity, including by removing barriers to competition and obstacles for
small firms to grow; and (iv) continued strengthening of the financial sector’s position and its
capacity to support growth. Undoing past reforms could create uncertainty and weigh on mediumterm prospects.

A. Fiscal Policy: Resuming Growth-Friendly and Inclusive Consolidation
17.
The fiscal stance is set to tighten in 2017. The Council of EU Finance Ministers extended
Spain’s deadline to exit the EDP by two years, with new deficit targets of 3.1 and 2.2 percent of GDP
in 2017 and 2018, respectively, calling for an annual structural adjustment of 0.5 percent of GDP.
Fiscal measures adopted by the government for 2017 will offset part of the CIT revenue decline, by
tightening CIT credit and deductions for large companies, raise excises for tobacco and alcohol, and

budget for 2017 still has to be adopted, the
planned fiscal adjustment is an important step to reduce the structural deficit and public debt.
18.
However, a credible medium-term consolidation path has yet to emerge. The
government projects the structural deficit to fall to about 1¼ percent of GDP by 2019 on the
account of expenditure restraint, but no specific measures have been announced. Thus, under
current policies, staff estimates the structural deficit to remain at around 2¼ percent of GDP over
the medium term—still far from the structural balanced budget objective.4 Risks to reach fiscal
targets are also considerable at the regional level, given the poor compliance track record (see SIP
chapter III), weak enforcement of regional targets, and weak market discipline related to support via
the regional liquidity mechanisms (which lowered the regions’ interest payments by 0.3 percent of
GDP in 2015).
19.
Fiscal space is limited and remaining fiscal vulnerabilities demand gradual but steady
and well-specified fiscal adjustment. Under current policies, both gross and net debt ratios are
projected to remain elevated over the medium term at around 95½ percent and 80 percent of GDP,
respectively, despite the favorable interest-growth differential, thus limiting fiscal space for cyclical
policy responses to shocks. Gross funding needs are still high at about 18 percent of GDP in 2017.
The fiscal outlook faces risks, particularly from policy implementation shortfalls, potential negative
growth shocks, and the realization of contingent liabilities. For example, in a growth shock scenario
with two consecutive years of recession, debt levels would be pushed near 110 percent of GDP
(11 percentage points higher than in the baseline projection) and annual gross financing needs
above 22 percent of GDP in 2018 (Appendix IV). In contrast, returning to a gradual but sustained
4

Staff baseline projections (i.e., “current policies”) include 0.4 percent structural revenue measures in 2017 and

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

SPAIN

fiscal consolidation would put debt firmly on a downward path. For instance, an annual adjustment
of the structural primary balance of about 0.5 percent of GDP beyond 2017, and a multiplier of 0.6
(assuming revenue-based measures), would lower the debt-to-GDP ratio by 4 percentage points in
2021 compared to the baseline (Figure 7). Such an adjustment pace would strike an appropriate
balance between preserving growth and ensuring public debt sustainability, while simultaneously
lowering the sovereign-bank nexus (Annex II) It would also be consistent with the latest EC
recommendation and with reaching structural balanced budget in five years, close to the target date
set for meeting national rules.


Most of the medium-term adjustment will need to come from higher revenues and should
also create space to support greater inclusiveness and employment creation. While there is
some room for spending restraint and rationalization, the public primary spending-to-GDP ratio
is already relatively low compared to those of EU peers. So far, nearly two-thirds of the
adjustment (5½ percent of potential GDP) has come from spending measures. And the
expenditure-to-GDP ratio is expected to decline by another 2½ percentage points over the
medium term under current policies, as expenditure is envisaged to rise only in line with the
GDP deflator and thus fall relative to nominal GDP (according to the latest Stability Program).
With total medium-term adjustment needs of 2¼ percent of GDP for structural balanced budget
by 2021, priority should be given to the least distortive revenue measures that raise VAT
collections, tackle the remaining inefficiencies in the tax system, and increase environmental
levies or excises. Such revenue measures also have low multipliers, thus limiting their negative
short-term impact on economic activity. Advancing expenditure rationalization could also
contribute to the fiscal adjustment, but should not come at the expense of targeted incentives
for employment creation and productivity growth.

Improving the value added tax (VAT) efficiency. VAT collection is about 3 percentage points
of final consumption lower than the EU average, mirroring Spain’s large VAT gap. Only about
60 percent of the consumption basket pays VAT at the standard rate in Spain, compared to 70
and 80 percent in France and Germany, respectively. VAT preferential treatments via lower rates



Addressing the remaining tax system inefficiencies. Despite the 2014 tax reform, the tax
system is still characterized by a large number of deductions, exemptions, and fiscal incentives,
which tend to reduce the tax bases and collection even with the high marginal rates. Addressing
remaining inefficiencies in the Spanish tax system, as recommended by the governmentappointed committee of experts in 2014, would therefore be important and could yield
additional revenue of ¼–½ percent of GDP. Continuing efforts against informality and tax
evasion can also help improve the efficiency of revenue collection.



Raising excise duties and environmental
levies. Despite increases in recent years,
environmental taxes remain significantly
below the EU average, with reduced effective
rates especially on energy. Harmonizing and
enhancing the performance of environmental
taxes could raise about ¼–½ percent of GDP
in a relatively non-distortionary way.

cuts in 2016 could usefully be replaced by
thorough expenditure reviews that focus on improving the quality and efficiency of public
spending via better targeting, and eliminate unfunded mandates at the regional level.
Conducting health and education reviews would be a priority to assess expenditure needs and
minimum provision standards against the availability of financing resources at all government
levels, including social security. Improved procurement procedures, in particular for

vulnerable—could also help to lower or contain fiscal costs. And finally, better targeting hiring
subsidies, as well as streamlining various hiring incentives—to lower further the tax wedge for
the young and low-income earners—would provide more effective support for job creation for
those that have difficulties in entering the labor market.


Supporting job creation and inclusion. Active labor market programs and R&D fiscal
incentives continue to be ineffective, calling foremost for better coordination and targeting,
with fiscal resources to be reallocated to the most efficient programs (see Sections B and C).
Any of the proposed fiscal measures should create sufficient space to provide better protection
for vulnerable groups. Moreover, an introduction of fiscal incentive schemes could be
considered, in the context of the regional financing system reform, to encourage regional
governments to accelerate the implementation of structural reform measures, for example, in
the area of the Market Unity Law and active labor market policies.

20.
Without bold reforms the regional
financing framework remains a risk for the
achievement of fiscal targets. The last electoral
cycle was a first true test for the fiscal governance
framework adopted in the 2012 Budget Stability Law
reform, and it exposed old and new fault lines, in
particular of the sub-national fiscal regime.
Compliance with the rules has been weak and
uneven so far with limited enforcement (Figure 7). In
addition to the weaknesses on the governance side,
issues with fiscal autonomy—the intergovernmental
fiscal mechanism—continue to hamper compliance
and fiscal discipline. A two-pronged approach could address this:

Allowing regions’ fiscal targets to temporarily differ would help to account for structural
differences in adjustment needs and fiscal capacity. In the medium term, governance can be
strengthened further by (i) enforcing more automatically sub-national fiscal rules, starting with

preventive actions and escalating to corrective and coercive mechanisms; (ii) harmonizing
conditions, monitoring, and transparency requirements for regions that access the regional
liquidity mechanism with those under the Economic and Financial Plans; and (iii) improving
public financial management systems to allow for comprehensive and frequent evaluation of
compliance with fiscal rules and targets.


Reforming the system of regional finances. Enforcement will likely remain challenging unless
the governance framework is matched with a regional financial system that improves the
regions’ capacity and incentives for fiscal discipline. In connection with a regional spending
review (in particular for education and health), reforms should aim at (i) increasing the
transparency and effectiveness of the fiscal equalization system to ensure meeting the public
service provision standards without undermining regions’ broader spending mandates;
(ii) enhancing the regions’ revenue-raising capacity so as to better match the greater degree of
expenditure decentralization and raise accountability; (iii) enhancing the intergovernmental
transfer settlement system by reducing the size discrepancies and time lags between advance
payments and legal entitlements; and (iv) phasing out the use of regional liquidity mechanisms
for non-emergency purposes and considering introducing rainy-day funds to improve fiscal
resilience in normal times.

Authorities’ Views
21.
The authorities are committed to achieving the 2017 deficit target and agreed with the
need to improve regional public finances. They considered that the adopted measures will deliver
at least ½ percent of GDP structural adjustment, enough to reach the 3.1 percent of GDP deficit
target. While the authorities generally agreed on the need for reducing the deficit and debt in the
medium term in order to strengthen the resilience of the Spanish economy, they also stressed that
the pace and composition of the fiscal adjustment should not weaken the momentum of growth
and job creation. They stressed that the approach set out in the Draft Budgetary Plan for 2017 would
allow for a progressive reduction in the structural deficit, including through improved fiscal
compliance and the application of the spending rule, which would avoid the need for future tax
hikes. Regarding the system of regional public finances, the authorities noted that fundamental
reforms were necessary, particularly to enhance fiscal prudence, but the complexity of the issues
would require strong political commitment, beyond the broad consensus on the reform needs, if
progress was to be made. They also suggested that stricter enforcement of corrective measures
introduced in the 2012 Budget Stability Law had started to improve the fiscal compliance of some
regions and mitigated moral hazard risks.

B. Labor Market: Tackling Long-Term Unemployment and Labor Market
Rigidities
22.
An immediate priority is promoting job creation for the long-term unemployed and
low-skilled youth. The impact of ALMPs, especially for those who have been jobless for years and
low-skilled youth, has been limited, and high unemployment had unfortunate implications for social

exclusion (Box 2). This calls for urgent improvement in policy effectiveness, particularly by better
coordination with regional governments. Reviewing the effectiveness of the current toolkit of
ALMPs, for example as part of the OECD peer review exercise, could guide the reallocation of
resources to the most promising programs and development of new alternatives in line with the
most successful programs in other EU countries. Specifically, profiling of job seeker’s characteristics
should be strengthened to provide more personalized assistance programs, and cooperation
between the public employment service and private job-placement agencies will need to be
improved for better outcomes of customized programs. Improving and modernizing training,
apprenticeship, and education programs, including by better aligning them to current labor market
needs, would help reduce skill mismatches, especially for low-skilled youth and individuals formerly
employed in the construction sector. In this respect, reducing the high share of early school leavers
is a key challenge. Making effective use of—and potentially enhancing—the EU’s Youth Guarantee
schemes could support the employability of low-skilled youth, too. At the same time, the ties
between active and passive policies could be strengthened, for example by strictly enforcing the
requirement of the verification of an active job search and participation in activation programs to
receive unemployment benefits. Finally, various hiring subsidies, including lower social security
contributions for all new contracts, could be consolidated to create effective and better-targeted
subsidy schemes, particularly, for low-skilled and long-term unemployed.

Lowering labor market duality requires
making permanent contracts more attractive
for employers. The high labor market duality
(particularly among the youth) exacerbates
employment volatility, lowers human capital
investment and workers’ productivity, and
increases inequality. While labor market reforms
have lowered several obstacles for open-ended
hires, the remaining significant gap between the
costs for permanent and temporary workers
continue to act as a disincentive for employers to

offer open-ended positions (Annex I). This could be tackled by, for example, simplifying the menu of
contracts to choose from, while effectively reducing the employment protection gap. One option is
to introduce a single open-ended contract with no ex-ante time limit and severance payments that
increase gradually with tenure. This could co-exist with separate contracts that account for the
specific needs and costs related to training staff and employment in sectors with high seasonal
turnover (e.g., tourism and agriculture). An alternative is to gradually introduce the Austrian
‘backpack’ model, under which entitlements to severance payments acquired in one job can be
carried to subsequent jobs, so that severance payments grow with tenure regardless of contract
type. In the meantime, the persistent legal and administrative uncertainties that hamper the
effectiveness of labor market reforms and affect open-ended employment should be addressed. In
particular, a number of formal requirements for collective dismissals and the possibility of nullifying
the dismissal on formal grounds have been associated with high cost of annulled dismissals on
grounds of procedural mistakes. Simplifying the list of possible causes for nullifying a dismissal and
differentiating the corrective actions between annulments based on procedural and substantial
grounds would mitigate legal uncertainties that have served as disincentives to open-ended
contracts.
24.
Enhanced flexibility to set working conditions, especially in SMEs, is also critical.
Ensuring that wage dynamics reflect differences in firm- and sector-specific conditions would
promote a reallocation of resources toward more productive sectors, boost aggregate productivity
and income, and reduce structural unemployment. The labor market reforms included steps in this
direction: prioritizing firm-level agreements over higher-level ones; making it somewhat easier for
firms in economic difficulties to ‘opt-out’ from higher level agreements; and limiting ultra-activity
(the period during which an expired agreement would remain valid). However, the reform has not
been able to promote a substantial change in the structure of collective bargaining. Wage flexibility
generally improved, but the incidence of firm-level agreement has not increased significantly. Firmlevel agreements remain especially unusual for SMEs, and ‘opting-out’ is the only possibility of wage
adjustment for these firms, but only based on agreements with workers’ representatives, as the
procedures for resolving potential conflicts associated with ‘opt-outs’ remain excessively
demanding. Enhancing the flexibility at the firm rather than sectoral-regional level could be
facilitated by eliminating the automatic extension of negotiated working conditions to all firms in
the corresponding sector, for example by strictly verifying the thresholds of unions and employers’
representativeness.
Authorities’ Views
25.
The authorities emphasized the importance of continued job creation and the need
not to reverse the 2012 labor market reforms, while recognizing scope for some fine-tuning.
Lowering unemployment, especially for the long-term unemployed and low-skilled youth, is a policy
priority. The authorities stressed that there is broad political consensus that enhancing the
effectiveness of ALMPs is critical, with efforts already underway, such as improving the incentive
alignment with the regional governments and private sector partners. Tackling pervasive labor
market duality is a longer-term goal that requires a consensus among social partners on the ways

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SPAIN

forward. Therefore, an expert group will first develop policy options before engaging in a new
dialogue. As regards the collective bargaining process, the authorities noticed that the labor reforms
have given firms greater flexibility to adapt to their differentiated business needs, and the easier
opting out has served as a disciplining tool, despite its muted uptake so far. Nevertheless, the issue
of greater representativeness to conclude collective agreements with general effects could be
explored over the medium term. The authorities stressed that their immediate focus is on preserving
reform achievements, in particular in the context of the recent decision on temporary replacement
workers by the Court of Justice of the European Union.

C. Structural Reforms: Boosting Firm Productivity and Growth
26.
Spain’s weak productivity remains a core medium-term challenge. A large part of the
recent improvement in total factor productivity (TFP) growth was a result of drastic labor shedding
and exit of low-productivity firms during the crisis. The reform agenda initiated in 2012 is likely to
keep TFP growth at slightly above ½ percent over the next five years, implying that potential growth
will rise gradually but not surpass 1½ percent without further reform efforts. Spain’s corporate
landscape, with many small firms that tend to be less productive, innovative, and export-oriented
than European peers, is behind this phenomenon (Figure 9). At the same time, significant withinsector heterogeneity in firm productivity points to inefficient resource allocation.

1/ See Hsieh and Klenow (2009), “Misallocation and Manufacturing TFP in China and India,”
Quarterly Journal of Economics. The authors decompose the logarithm of sectoral TFP into the
difference between the logarithms of the “clean” TFP, i.e. TFP that would exist in a sector
without factor market distortions, and a measure of resource misallocation. Misallocation is
proxied by the variance of the logarithm of the total factor revenue productivity of a firm in a
specific sector, adjusted by the price elasticity of demand in the same sector. For illustration,
imagine a two firm economy, where only one of the firms faces capital distortions, e.g. capital
subsidies. Removing the distortion and reallocating the same amount of capital across all firms
(so as to equalize their marginal products of capital) would increase the aggregate output. This
would remove the firm-level distortion and also increase sectoral TFP, since the economy
would produce more with the same inputs.

27.
A number of factors weigh on firm growth and productivity. Staff analysis finds that
product market regulation, in particular in more tightly-regulated sectors, has weighed on TFP
growth. Moreover, different regulatory practices across regions, leading to an uneven business
environment, have limited the capacity of firms to benefit from larger markets and exploit
economies of scale. Size-dependent rules and regulations, including past tax incentives to SMEs,
have also lowered firm productivity growth. Finally, the relatively high debt-to-asset ratio, by
constraining access to finance and investment, has held back firm productivity and growth, in
particular, for SMEs that tend to have weaker financial position compared to other firms (second
chapter of SIP). Survey results corroborate these empirical findings.

Enhancing innovation capacity, which is currently limited by low private R&D spending and
weak public R&D spending efficiency. This could be addressed by improving the weak
coordination across government layers, strengthening public-private sector cooperation, and
enhancing internationalization and financing.

Authorities’ Views
29.
The authorities broadly agreed with the main obstacles to firm-level productivity
growth and the proposed policy options. In particular, they shared the need to improve the
regulatory environment and enhance competition by faster implementation of the Market Unity
Law. While the authorities concurred with the benefits from liberalizing professional services, they
stressed the importance to advance this agenda also at the EU level. Enhancing innovation would
need to go beyond R&D spending and require reforms also to the education system.

D. Financial Sector: Continue Strengthening Capacity to Support Growth
30.
Continued promotion of banks and borrowers’ resilience is a critical part of the
economic recovery. Due to better asset quality, stronger capital and funding positions, and
reduced debt overhangs, the system is closer to putting most of the crisis legacies behind it.
Similarly, borrowers have also reduced their debt overhangs amid improving labor market
conditions. Going forward, enhancing further the resilience of both sides and expanding the still
limited access to non-bank funding, particularly for frontier innovation, will be key to ensure stable
financing of the economy over the medium term.

33.
Adjusting to profitability pressures is a key challenge, especially in the current macrofinancial environment. Similar to other European economies, banks’ profitability in Spain is
currently well below the pre-crisis level, with the return on equity lower than the cost of capital.
Profitability has been stable in the past year, as for business in Spain reduced net interest and other
income has been offset by falling impairment costs. The more difficult domestic and global
operating conditions, in particular in a low interest rate environment, will put pressure on banks’
cost structure and business models. Achieving greater efficiency, in particular since Spanish banks
still rely on a larger branch network than European peers, further reducing operating expenses, and
raising non-interest income will be central to addressing the profitability challenge.

Efforts to further improve access to finance for SMEs should continue. Access of

complemented by European efforts, including by
guarantees extended under the Juncker plan.
35.
Three items under Spain’s financial sector reform remain to be completed: the
divestment of public ownership in two banks and the liquidation of real estate assets owned by the
Asset Management Company (SAREB). The framework for savings banks and banking foundations is
now fully in place, and requires banking foundations either to divest relevant credit institutions or to
set up reserve funds. The legal challenge related to the 2011 IPO of Bankia has been addressed,
removing the deadlock for further privatization. However, the plan by the Spanish Resolution
Authority (FROB) to sell its stakes in Bankia/BFA and BMN has stalled due to market conditions and
political uncertainties, with the new government extending the deadline for the sale of both
institutions by two years. FROB has recently hired a consultant to explore the option of merging the
two institutions before a sale. At the same time, SAREB reduced its portfolio more slowly than
planned (by 15 percent or about €8 billion) in the first three years due to difficult market conditions,
but the recovery of the real estate market should bolster future sales. SAREB again registered a loss
in 2015, following the adoption of the new accounting rule that requires appraisals of underlying
collaterals in all loan books to properly reflect marking-to-market. The loss significantly eroded its
capital and resulted in a conversion of subordinated debt into equity, with minimal impact on
exposed banks given provisions made already.
36.
The macroprudential policy framework remains to be fully put in place. The Bank of
Spain has employed macroprudential powers, setting the amounts of countercyclical capital buffers
(at zero) and capital surcharges for systemic banks, but the national macroprudential authority has
not been established. Given the financial cycle, there are no imminent systemic risks in the cyclical
dimension. Nevertheless, the macroprudential policy framework should be developed to safeguard
financial stability by mitigating a buildup of systemic risk following the return to positive credit
growth and rising housing prices in the near future.
37.
Progress towards the banking union continues. In February 2016, the Bank of Spain
completed the transposition of the capital requirements regulation and directive (CRR/CRD IV). The

22

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SPAIN

Bank of Spain also plans to amend regulations so as to align national discretions of the CRR with the
recent ECB regulation. Under the Single Supervisory Mechanism banks benefit from a more forwardlooking supervisory approach that focuses on business model and risk management. Preparation for
resolution plans remains work in progress, with banks preferring the multiple points of entry
approach for their subsidiaries outside the euro area. The upcoming FSAP will review the overall
financial stability architecture and advise on further enhancing the financial system’s resilience.
Authorities’ Views
38.
The authorities broadly agreed with staff’s assessment on the recent progress and
remaining challenges in the financial sector. The authorities stressed that the positive trends in
the banking system were the outcome of the decisive financial sector reform, including
recapitalization and balance sheet cleansing. They highlighted the progress made in NPL reduction
over the last years and considered this pace to be appropriate. The Bank of Spain has continued to
ensure adequate provisioning and forced weak banks to take additional measures, as needed, to
address legacy asset problems. The authorities considered that going forward, low profitability
would be the main challenge for banks, as in virtually all other European banking systems. They
viewed banks as being well-positioned to handle forthcoming regulatory changes and supported
the finalization and implementation of pending financial reforms. The authorities are committed to
develop the macroprudential framework.

STAFF APPRAISAL
39.
The Spanish economy has continued its impressive recovery and strong job creation.
Real GDP and employment growth have outpaced the euro area average despite a prolonged
period of domestic political uncertainty. The current account is projected to record its fourth
consecutive annual surplus. And private sector balance sheets have further strengthened.
40.
Earlier reforms and confidence-enhancing measures have laid the ground for this
rebound, and they need to be preserved. In particular, wage moderation and greater labor
market flexibility have helped the economy regain competitiveness and have contributed to strong
job creation. Together with banking sector reforms they have made the Spanish economy more
resilient. Reversing policy achievements could hurt market confidence and weigh on medium-term
growth prospects.
41.
Despite considerable progress, adjustment is still incomplete and structural problems
persist. Far too many Spaniards are still without employment and many have been jobless for years.
Together with still pervasive labor market duality this has raised social exclusion, inhibited human
capital investment, and served as a drag on productivity. Lowering structural unemployment
and raising medium-term potential growth above the estimated annual 1.5 percent remain key
challenges. At the same time, high public debt, pockets of over-indebtedness in the private sector,
and the still large negative net international investment position leave the economy vulnerable
to shocks.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

23

SPAIN

42.
Maintaining high job-rich growth calls for a comprehensive medium-term strategy.
Preserving past reform achievements is of utmost importance, but it cannot by itself sustain the
dynamic economic performance. To advance the structural agenda, immediate attention should be
given to those priority areas for which there is a commonly shared view on reform needs and
objectives, though not necessarily on the preferred policy tools: enhancing ALMP to lower long-term
and youth unemployment, reforming regional public finances to safeguard public finances, and
strengthening innovation and education policies to lift productivity. Going forward, additional labor
and product market reforms need to enhance such a strategy.
43.
Resumption of gradual fiscal consolidation would ensure that debt is firmly put on a
downward path. Building on the large fiscal measures adopted over 2010–13, adjustment can take
a more measured pace but should be steady and be underpinned by well-defined policy actions.
An annual adjustment of the structural primary balance of about 0.5 percent of GDP would bring the
structural fiscal deficit into balance in five years and markedly lower the debt ratio. The pace would
strike an appropriate balance between preserving the economic recovery and mitigating fiscal risks.
44.
A carefully designed adjustment can be growth and job-friendly. In particular, Spain
has room to raise revenues. Gradually reducing VAT exemptions as well as raising excise duties
and environmental levies would bring revenue collection more in line with that of European peers.
On the expenditure side, room for further efficiency gains could be best gauged by conducting
thorough expenditure reviews—in particular in health and education. At the same time, it will
be important to properly shield vulnerable groups and enhance the efficiency of expenditure
programs that directly support employment and growth, such as ALMP and public research and
development spending.
45.
Without reforms, the regional financing framework remains a risk for public finances.
Reforms should aim to improve regions’ incentives to comply with fiscal targets while accounting for
their different economic capacities to do so. This calls for more automatic and stricter enforcement
of targets and providing regions with greater power to mobilize their own revenues. And finally, the
introduction of performance-based transfers could be considered to strengthen regions’ incentives
to advance critical reform areas, such as the implementation of the Market Unity Law and ALMP.
46.
Reducing unemployment, in particular long term and youth joblessness, remains a key
challenge. Despite recent efforts, the limited effectiveness of ALMP calls for urgent improvements,
particularly though better coordination with regional governments. The range of hiring subsidies
could be consolidated into better-targeted schemes, particularly for the low-skilled and long-term
unemployed. At the same time, the long-standing issue of labor market duality is still to be
addressed. Allowing firms more control and flexibility over working conditions is also critical to
enhance the functioning of the labor market.
47.
The current cyclical recovery is the right time to get a high pay-off from structural
reforms. In particular, three types of policies can help raise the low productivity of Spain’s many
SMEs. Implementing the Market Unity Law, advancing the delayed liberalization of professional
services, and lowering the cost of doing business would promote competition. Enhancing private

R&D investment, increasing the efficiency of public R&D spending, and improving access to nonbank financing for frontier innovation would foster high productive investment. And finally,
revisiting size-contingent regulations would help overcome the small business trap.
48.
The banking system has gained further strength amid new challenges. Due to better
asset quality, stronger capital and funding positions, and reduced debt overhangs, the system is
closer to putting most of the crisis legacies behind it. However, banks have progressed at different
speeds, and NPLs and foreclosed assets remain sizeable, though much lower than in some EU
countries. At the same time, like other European banking systems, Spain’s banks face challenges
arising from the low profitability environment and new regulatory initiatives. Going forward,
continuing to ensure adequate provisioning, further improving efficiency gains—possibly through
mergers—, boosting non-interest income, and increasing further high-quality capital would enhance
the banking system’s ability to withstand shocks, and facilitate sufficient credit provision as credit
demand picks up.
49.

It is recommended that Spain remain on the standard 12-month Article IV consultation cycle.

Box 1. What Has Been Driving the Recovery?
A combination of temporary tailwinds and structural reforms has driven the strong recovery of the Spanish
economy. Beginning in mid-2013, the rebound followed major labor market and banking sector reforms as well
as falling long-term interest rates but otherwise still weak external conditions, which have since improved.
The stronger-than-anticipated rebound was largely driven by temporary factors. At 3.2 percent in
2015, real GDP growth exceeded staff’s (and consensus) projection in the 2014 October WEO by 1.5 p.p. A
decomposition of the growth surprise reveals that external tailwinds and fiscal expansion account for the
bulk of it.

The decline in oil price and interest rates explains
about two thirds of the better growth outturn, each
contributing about ½ p.p. Compared to the projection in
the October 2014 WEO, oil prices dropped by some
34 percent and long-term interest rates by about 100 bps.1

The impact of weaker euro in combination with
wage moderation (5 percent real exchange rate
depreciation, unit-labor-cost based) was broadly offset by
external headwinds from weaker growth in the euro area
and the resulting softer foreign demand for Spanish
exports (-¼ p.p.).


A looser-than-projected fiscal stance (structural primary impulse of about 0.8 percent of GDP)
provided an additional boost of about 0.4 p.p.

The remaining part of the growth surprise (about 0.2 p.p.) can be attributed to other factors, such as
stronger confidence effects of structural reforms.
For 2016, growth will likely exceed earlier staff projections by 0.6 p.p. of which two thirds can be attributed
to a looser than expected fiscal stance and most of the rest to stronger foreign demand.
At the same time, structural reforms, initiated in 2012, have made a difference. A simple benchmarking
exercise suggests that structural measures adopted so far could boost potential output by about 2½ percent

with moderate wage growth over the last few
years, are estimated to boost potential output by
1.1 percent over five years.

output by close to 1 percent over the medium term.

Box 2. Inequality and Poverty in the Aftermath of the Crisis
Income inequality and risks of poverty or social exclusion increased markedly with the global financial crisis on
the back of a dramatic fall in employment, which affected young, unskilled, and temporary workers
disproportionally. Measures to address duality and increase the employability of long-term and young
unemployed are a policy priority to reduce risks of social exclusion among vulnerable groups.
The swift job creation since 2014-15 has started to dent the
rising risks of poverty and social exclusion. But the benefit of
the recovery has been uneven across generations and levels of
education. Especially the employment of the young und lowskilled workers has lagged behind, making policies that improve
their employability a priority.
As a result of the crisis, social indicators deteriorated
sharply. The number of people at risk of poverty or social
exclusion increased by more than 23 percent between 2007 and
2015 in Spain. Low-skilled workers, youth, and immigrants have
been particularly vulnerable. At the same time, income inequality
also deteriorated markedly, with the Gini coefficient rising by
2¾ points during this period. Spain now exhibits the third
highest income quintile share ratio in the EU, with the top
20 percent of the population earning almost 7½ times as much
income as the bottom 20 percent.

sector under temporary contracts. Moreover, unemployment
spells of these groups have increased substantially, increasing the risks of social exclusion. At the same time,
wage dispersion has risen, correcting in part the pre-crisis misallocation of resources to low productivity
sectors and consequent wage inflation, including in the oversized construction sector, and in part reflecting
the dual labor market. However, estimates suggest that the dominant effect on income inequality has been
from the drop in employment (Bonhomme and Hospido, 2012; OECD, 2015). 1

their stock market prices. Meanwhile, FDI flows from
Latin America to Spain have grown rapidly in recent years, but remain low in terms of FDI stocks (less than
5 percent of total FDI).
Spain’s two largest and global banks maintain significant subsidiary operations in Latin America. As of
March 2016, they had about one-fifth of credit exposures to Latin America resulting in total claims of
Spanish banks to the region of about 12 percent of total banking sector claims—a much higher share than
other advanced economies’ banking systems. In 2015, operations in Latin America accounted for 43 and
80 percent of group-wide profits (excluding centralized corporate operations) for the two Spanish global
banks, respectively, contributing a higher return on assets than domestic-oriented banks. These banks
operate with a subsidiary model primarily based on decentralized management and funded locally in
domestic-currency.
Spanish subsidiaries appear to be in a solid position to deal with rising credit risk, but lower profits
would weaken contributions to the parents’ capital buffers. So far, the adverse macroeconomic
conditions, in particular in Argentina, Brazil and Venezuela, and asset quality deterioration have not yet
significantly marked down profitability, although NPLs typically worsen with some lag. Spanish subsidiaries
should be able to manage additional losses given their relatively strong profits and provisions. Their preimpairment net income could potentially absorb about up to twice the current NPL level, but an increase in
asset impairments could have a sizeable impact on group-wide profitability. For example, a 25 percent
increase in the impairment of financial assets by subsidiaries could reduce the contribution of profits to
group-wide capital by about 25 percent.

Annex I. Taking Stock of the 2012 Labor Market Reforms1
The labor market reforms enacted in February 2012 aimed at addressing Spain’s structural
problems. Spain’s labor market has historically been characterized by very high structural
unemployment, employment volatility, wage rigidity, high shares of temporary employment, and
low labor productivity. The 2012 reforms included measures to enhance market efficiency and
reduce duality; to foster firms’ internal flexibility and avoid employment destruction; and to enhance
the employability and fungibility of workers (see first chapter of Spain: Selected Issues Papers, 2015
for a detailed list of measures).
Overall, the 2012 labor market reforms have helped improve the functioning of the Spanish
labor market, but important rigidities remain. Although it is difficult to disentangle the effects of
the reforms and the agreement reached by social partners in early 2012 when the recession was
hitting employment hard, there is extensive evidence indicating that the reforms have supported
wage moderation. Moreover, reforms and moderate wage growth have supported job creation and
helped Spain regain competitiveness lost during the pre-crisis boom. The reforms have also made
the labor market more resilient to shocks and promoted a moderate reduction in duality and
structural unemployment. However, important structural problems remain. Unemployment is still
painfully high with a high incidence of long-term unemployment. Labor market duality remains
pervasive. And, although the reforms have enhanced macro-flexibility, micro-flexibility is still low.
The sections below summarize the main evidence so far of the impact of the reforms.

A.

Wages and Employment

Overall, the empirical evidence suggests that the labor market reforms have supported wage
moderation and contributed to a pickup in job creation. Although the evidence points to increased
macro-flexibility, there is no evidence of increased micro-flexibility (i.e., changes in wages still do not
reflect specific business conditions of firms and sectors).


Empirical analysis suggests that the reforms have contributed to significant wage moderation
(Bank of Spain 2013, OECD 2014, Garcia-Perez 2016). OECD (2014) estimates a reduction in unit
labor costs of 1.2–1.9 percent associated with the reforms (that is, half of the actual adjustment
in the year following the reform).



Analysis by IMF (2015), focusing on the variation of wages and employment across sectors
during pre- and post-reform years, points to increased macro-flexibility of wages. Results show
that before the reforms, wage growth accelerated in expansions, but also during downswings
(though by lesser extent), slowing labor market adjustment and contributing to excessive labor
shedding during recessions. Since the reform, employment contractions are no longer
associated with higher wage growth. At the same time, there is no evidence that wage dynamics

have responded systematically to sector-specific variation in economic conditions, pointing to
persistent lack of micro-flexibility. Finally, the study finds that wage moderation has contributed
to a recovery in headline employment growth, and the reforms have made the labor market
more resilient to shocks.


The extent of wage moderation, however, varied significantly across level of wages and between
workers who kept their jobs (stayers) and those who had to change jobs (movers). Real wages of
workers in the first and second lowest deciles fell by 25 percent and 15 percent, respectively,
between 2008 and mid-2013, while those of the highest deciles increased slightly (10 percent in
the top decile). The movers, especially those with temporary contracts, youth, and low-skilled
workers, suffered the largest losses (Conde-Ruiz and others, 2015). As a consequence of the
sharp adjustment in the low end of the wage distribution, wage inequality surged significantly
(see Box 2 in the 2016 IMF Staff Report).



Reforms have also supported hiring, in particular under permanent contracts through two
channels: by increasing the probability of transition from unemployment to permanent
employment and reducing the probability of dismissals for workers under temporary contracts—
arguably due to the fact that firms started using the new internal flexibility provisions introduced
by the reform (Garcia-Perez, 2016).2 In fact, OECD (2014) suggests that about 25,000 new
permanent contracts per month can be explained by the reforms (in the first 18 months), with
the impact concentrated in SMEs. De Cea and Dolado (2013) find that the output growth rate
threshold necessary for net job creation declined after the reform (estimating such threshold at
0.3–1.3 percent).



What does the evidence show on the impact of the reforms on dismissals? OECD (2014) finds
that the impact on separation rates in the first 1½ years since the reform was negligible.
Meanwhile, there was evidence pointing to some negative effects of the changes introduced to
the regulation on dismissals. The number of collective dismissals deemed null due to formal or
administrative/procedural omissions or mistakes increased sizably, with employers being forced
to re-hire dismissed workers.3 This proliferation of nullifying provisions by the courts had
increased legal uncertainty (Jansen, 2015; OECD, 2014).



Latest estimates suggest the following quantitative impact from the increased wage moderation
and firms’ internal flexibility, using two counterfactual scenarios (Doménech and others, 2016). In
the absence of the wage adjustment facilitated by the reform, additional 900,000 jobs would
have been lost—basically offsetting the overall net job creation observed in 2014–15. Moreover,
the loss of 2 million long-term jobs and an increase of about 8 percentage points in the

However, as explained below, the overall impact on duality has been marginal in the short term.

3

For instance, Palomo Balda (2013) shows that although litigation affected only about 5 percent of all collective
dismissals between March 2012 and March 2013, in 40 percent of the cases the court ruled the collective dismissals
to be null due to administrative reasons. This is the case even when in 85 percent of those cases the actual grounds
for dismissal were considered to be valid.

unemployment rate could have been prevented had the extent of wage flexibility observed after
the reform prevailed in the period 2008–12.

B.

Duality

The empirical evidence suggests that the labor market reforms have helped reduce duality. However,
although the impact is generally statistically significant, the economic significance is still quite small.


Although there is some evidence suggesting that the labor market reform promoted a pickup in
permanent employment, a large share of the new jobs (53 percent) relies on temporary
contracts and the share of temporary jobs in overall employment has remained fairly flat since
2008 at about 25 percent—among the highest in Europe. Compared to the pre-crisis levels, the
share of temporary jobs declined by around 6 percentage points, but most of the reduction was
due to the large destruction of temporary jobs (mostly in the period 2008–12) rather than a
substitution of temporary for permanent contracts. At the same time, the share of permanent
contracts in the flow on new contracts signed each month has remained fairly stable at around
8–10 percent, with no apparent change since the reform.



Results in OECD (2014) indicate that, although the reform could have contributed to some
increase in new permanent jobs and increase the share of permanent employment in new hires
by 3 percentage points, duality remained very high.



IMF (2015) finds some evidence that the share of new hires with temporary contracts has
started to decrease due to the 2012 reform. However, the reliance on temporary workers
remains strong overall.



Garcia-Perez (2016) finds that the reform appears to have promoted the exit from
unemployment into permanent employment both in absolute terms and relative to temporary
employment. The results indicate that the reform has raised the transition probability from
unemployment to permanent employment by about 50 percent, raising it from 1.7 percent to
2.6 percent, on average, in the first 12 months of unemployment. However, since the
probability of transition to temporary employment, which continues to be—by far—the most
likely option (12 percent in the first year of unemployment) the overall effect on the stock of
permanent employment is still marginal in the short term. The results suggest a positive but
very small impact of the reform on the still high duality, to the extent that exit from
unemployment to a temporary job is still five times higher than to a permanent job (12 percent
and 2.6 percent, respectively).

C.

Collective Negotiation

Existing evidence indicates that the 2012 labor market reforms did not have a major impact on the
structure of collective negotiation, with agreements still mostly negotiated at the sector-province level
with few firms ‘opting-out’ from higher level agreements.

46

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SPAIN



The evidence suggests that wage dynamics still do not adequately reflect differences in
firms’ business conditions. Although there has been an increase in the number of firm-level
agreements, these affect only a small number of workers mostly in large firms, and
collective agreements continue to be negotiated largely at the sector-province level. Firmlevel agreements remain especially unusual for SMEs, and ‘opting-out’ is the only possibility
of wage adjustment for these firms, but only based on agreements with workers’
representatives, as the procedures for resolving potential conflicts associated with ‘opt-outs’
remain excessively demanding.



The coverage of collective negotiation has not declined as many were concerned about (see, for
instance, Bentolila and Jansen, 2016). Although the number of workers affected by collective
agreements has declined since the reform, the number of private sector workers has fallen even
more, so that the coverage rate has actually increased moderately.

D.

Structural Unemployment

Although there is some evidence that the labor market reforms have helped reduce the structural
unemployment rate, the later remains stubbornly high, at about 16 percent.


OECD (2014) finds that the reform appears to have reduced the duration of unemployment
spells, which could help reduce structural unemployment.



IMF staff estimates indicate that between 2012 and 2015, the estimated structural
unemployment declined by around 3 percentage points. However, at about 16 percent, it
remains very high, reflecting both long-standing problems and the impact of the crisis.
Among the long-term issues are the pervasive labor market duality and its impact on workers’
skill levels.

Annex II. Balance Sheet Approach: How Much Has Spain
Adjusted?1
Despite some adjustment, the Spanish economy remains vulnerable to balance sheet shocks that could
be propagated through certain sectoral linkages. Potential sources of propagation are the high general
government indebtedness with large exposures to the domestic financial sector and the rest of the
world, lingering debt overhangs in parts of the private sector with banks, and the reliance on Euro Area
monetary policy. Changes in the regional monetary policy stance, risk perception, or the occurrence of
sizable shocks could put pressure on balance sheets via these sectoral linkages.
This note uses the balance sheet approach to assess the recent evolution of Spain’s financial
vulnerabilities.2 Given that many of the remaining vulnerabilities of the Spanish economy relate to
stocks rather than flows, the balance sheet assessment summarizes these exposures, their
interlinkages, and which sectors have adjusted their leverage and against whom (including the role
of valuation effects). The approach uses a matrix of intersectoral financial claims. For this purpose,
the economy is divided into seven sectors: general government (GG), the central bank (BdE),
monetary financial institutions excluding the central bank (MFI), other financial institutions (OFI),
non-financial corporates (COR), households (HH), and the rest of the World (RoW). By construction,
the sum of the domestic sectoral net positions equals the country’s net position vis-à-vis the rest of
the world (i.e., the Net International Investment Position, NIIP).3

Internal and external deleveraging reflects the ongoing but yet incomplete correction of precrisis imbalances and the impact of the crisis. From euro adoption in 1999 to 2008, Spain
experienced growing current account deficits that increased the private sector debt with the rest of
the world. While households and corporates

114 percent in 2016:Q2.
Spain’s net position against the rest of the world has changed little since the beginning of
2013 but its composition has shifted (Table A2.1). Even as Spain has exhibited large current
account surpluses in the last three years, its position toward the rest of the world is still highly
negative at 88 percent of GDP (2016:Q2). This is even slightly weaker than at end-2013, mostly due
to valuation changes and the significant increase in public liabilities held by the rest of the world
(17 percent) which more than offset the reduction in private sector’s net liabilities to the rest of the
world (by 16 percent of GDP).

The public sector is now more exposed
externally. Of the overall increase in the public
debt-to-GDP ratio of 21 percentage points since
2013, about 85 percent was absorbed by the rest
of the world. The external sector has largely
replaced the domestic financial system as the
main investor in newly issued government
securities, but banks’ exposure to the Spanish
sovereign remains large (see below).

Non-financial sector borrowing from

domestic banks has fallen from its peak in
2009. Credit growth to the non-financial private sector has remained negative owing to the weak
demand for new loans. While the demand for new loans has picked up in line with the economic
recovery, amortization has continued to outpace new bank lending. Depressed consumption and
investment levels, on the back of high unemployment, weak disposable incomes, low house prices,
and the need for corporates and households to strengthen their financial positions are the main
reasons behind the weak demand for new credit.
Banks’ exposure to households remains to be a vulnerability. Household debt (both relative to
GDP and disposable income) has been brought to a level that is comparable to other major EU
countries. However, household indebtedness in EU countries has been on the rise and is generally
considered to be a vulnerability. At the same time, the financial wealth of Spanish households is far
below that of EU peers and housing wealth well below pre-crisis levels, even though it is high in
international comparison.
The domestic banking system has reduced its sovereign exposure facilitated by the Public
Sector Purchase Program (PSPP). Since 2015, the ECB’s QE has purchased important amounts of
government-issued securities. These operations are largely carried out by domestic central banks
and kept on their balance sheets,4 while increasing their liabilities against the ECB (i.e., the rest of the

Spanish banks still hold a large proportion of
sovereign debt compared to peers. Even after
having stabilized their exposure to government
debt, domestic banks are still highly exposed to
sovereign risk. The fact that this exposure is
mainly domestic is a source of vulnerabilities.

Appendix I. Main Recommendations of the 2015 Article IV
Consultation and Authorities’ Actions
IMF 2015 Article IV Recommendations

Policy Actions
Fiscal Policy

Continue fiscal consolidation by using windfalls towards
deficit reduction, planning for an adjustment of
½ percent of GDP per year, and ensuring more ambitious
and better-specified measures at all government levels,
while protecting the most vulnerable.

At 5.1 percent of GDP the fiscal deficit exceeded the
deficit target by 0.9 percentage points despite strong
GDP growth and lower interest payments. The 2016
budget foresaw a small structural adjustment, but
higher-than-expected revenue shortfalls from PIT and
CIT changes and spending overruns are expected to
weaken the 2016 structural primary deficit.

Further improve the regional fiscal framework by
Some policy actions taken.
enhancing monitoring and enforcement of regional fiscal
targets, rules, rebalancing risk sharing and discipline, and
improving fiscal equalization and settlement procedures.
Financial Sector Policies
Further encourage banks to increase capital and reduce
the cost of carrying high NPLs.

Further strengthen SMEs access to finance by enhancing
market-based financing, accuracy of financial reporting
and transparency, by direct financing and guarantees for
new firms through ICO, including European efforts.

Banks have significantly strengthened their balance
sheets by further improving asset quality and increasing
capital buffers, though NPLs and foreclosed assets are
still sizeable.
New credit, including to SMEs, is being extended rapidly,
while private sector deleveraging still continues. Efforts
to increase market-based SME financing are also
continuing.

Facilitate private deleveraging by ensuring effective
implementation of the “fresh start” to encourage
demand, while preserving the strong payment culture.

The “fresh start” reform has been implemented but
additional efforts are needed to ensure the new system’s
efficacy.

Structural Reforms
Labor market reforms
Enhance labor market performance by (i) keeping wage
growth in line with productivity and external
competitiveness, (ii) ensuring the use of firm-level wage
bargaining and opt-out, particularly by small firms, (iii)
closing the gap between the dismissal costs of temporary
and permanent contracts, (iv) reducing legal and
administrative uncertainties in collective dismissals and
streamlining the application of objective criteria for fair
dismissals, (v) and increasing the effectiveness of active
labor market policies (ALMP).
Productivity growth
Support small firm growth by (i) fostering competition
through faster implementation of the Market Unity Law
and the liberalization of professional services, (ii)
assessing all size-related policies to identify and eliminate
unwarranted obstacles to growth, (iii) and supporting
internationalization and innovation.

Wage moderation continued. The use of firm-level wage
bargaining and opt outs is still being hampered by
administrative obstacles. No new policy action was taken
to close the gap between the dismissal costs of
temporary and permanent contracts. Similarly, no action
was taken to reduce legal and administrative
uncertainties in collective dismissals and streamlining the
application of objective criteria for fair dismissals.
Progress toward raising the effectiveness of ALMP has
been slow.
The implementation of the Market Unity Law is ongoing,
but differences in regulatory norms and practices across
Spain remain. Several size-dependent tax incentives were
eliminated with the 2015 CIT reform. No actions have
been taken to liberalize professional services.

Background. In 2016 the CPI-based real effective exchange rate (REER) increased by nearly 1 percent
from its average 2015 level and declined by about 6 percent from its 2009 peak. This partially reversed
the 17 percent appreciation from the euro entry in 1999 until 2009. The ULC-based REER, however,
shows the appreciation has been substantially reversed since euro entry, initially as a result of substantial
labor shedding, and more recently, of wage moderation
Assessment. The two EBA REER regression model approaches, the index and level REER tools, estimate
an overvaluation of 8.8 and 2 percent for 2016, respectively (with reference to the CPI-based REER).
Taking into account also the historical REER (CPI and ULC based) and model-based analysis, that
considers NIIP sustainability, on balance, staff assesses a 2016 gap of around 5 to 10 percent above the
level consistent with medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies.

Background. Financing conditions have continued to ease, with sovereign bond yields near historical
lows. At the same time, the private sector has continued its deleveraging against the rest of the world.
Assessment. The ECB’s actions as well as domestic reforms and fiscal consolidation have greatly helped
improve investor sentiment. However, large external financing needs both in the public and private
sector leave Spain vulnerable to sudden changes in market sentiment and spillovers from Europe.

Notes

1/ Based on data available through 2016Q2 and projections for 2016.
2/ The new EBA CA regression-based approach estimate would suggest that a CA surplus of 1.6 percent
of GDP would be appropriate for Spain. However, the empirically-based EBA norm does not fully
account for the very negative NIIP with less than 20 percent of liabilities in the form of equity. The staff
assessment is thus based on somewhat higher norm level (about 2 percent of GDP) that is consistent
with the overriding need to substantially strengthen the external balance sheet.

Background. The euro has the status of a global reserve currency.
Assessment. Reserves held by the euro area are typically low relative to standard metrics, but the
currency is free floating.

Background. After a peak CA deficit in 2007 of 9.6 percent of GDP, corrected initially by a sharp
contraction in imports, exports and imports have since grown strongly along with the economic recovery
leading to CA surpluses in 2013-15. In 2016, the CA surplus is projected to widen to 2 percent of GDP (or
1.2 percent of GDP cyclically adjusted). Regained competitiveness from price and wage moderation, and
the depreciation of the euro positively contributed to Spain’s healthy exports growth and resilient export
shares. ECB measures have helped to drive down interest rates on external debt, and the sharply lower
oil price has reduced import costs.
Assessment. While the EBA model-based estimates would suggest a CA norm for 2016 (1.6 percent of
GDP) close to the observed cyclically adjusted CA (1.2 percent of GDP), the staff assessment considers
the overriding need to sharply improve the NIIP and gauges the CA norm to be around 2 percent of
GDP. This implies that the cyclically adjusted CA was almost 1 percent of GDP weaker than desirable.
Surpluses of this magnitude will need to be maintained until the NIIP is at a safer and sustainable level.
Under staff’s current forecast, a gradually improving CA will strengthen the NIIP by about 4-5 percent of
GDP annually in the medium term. Reducing the still sizable structural fiscal deficit will be a key policy
requirement to lower the remaining imbalances.

Spain
Background. The net international investment position (NIIP) dropped from -35 percent of GDP in 2000
to –98 percent of GDP in 2009, driven mostly by substantial current account (CA) deficits but also
reflecting valuation effects. The CA improved subsequently, but the NIIP remains elevated at –88.5
percent at 2016Q2 which is 9 percentage point lower than in end-2014. Gross external debt is still high,
around 171 percent of GDP.
Assessment. The large negative NIIP comes with external vulnerabilities, including from large gross
financing needs from external debt and valuation changes. Mitigating factors are a favorable maturity
structure of Spain’s outstanding sovereign debt with an average of 6½ years and current ECB measures
such as QE.

Potential policy responses:
The authorities’ recent structural reforms,
in particular the labor market reform with
the resulting wage moderation, as well as
the Market Unity Law to reform product
markets, and fiscal deficit reductions are in
line with reducing imbalances.
In the medium term, further fiscal
adjustment and moving forward with
structural reforms of the labor market and
faster implementation of product market
reforms would be required to accelerate
the adjustment.
Continued monetary easing at the euro
area level to lift inflation closer to the
ECB’s medium-term price stability
objective should help increase external
demand, which would also support Spain’s
adjustment efforts.

Overall Assessment:
The external position in 2016 is estimated
to be substantially weaker than that
consistent with medium-term
fundamentals and desirable policy settings.
In 2016, the CA has continued to improve,
helped by lower oil import price and low
interest rates.
Despite the strong improvement in the CA
since the pre-crisis peak deficit in 2007,
achieving both a sufficiently declining NIIP
and much lower unemployment would
require a sustained weaker real effective
exchange rate.

Appendix IV. Debt Sustainability Analysis
Public debt sustainability risks remain sizeable, despite the reduction of the headline fiscal deficit over
the last six years. Under the baseline scenario, public debt is projected to decline slowly over the
medium term from the peak of 100.4 percent of GDP in 2014, on the back of a slightly favorable
growth-interest rate differential. However, at 95.6 percent of GDP in 2021, debt would remain at risky
levels. A negative growth shock and the realization of contingent liabilities represent the largest risks
to public debt sustainability. Returning to a gradual but steady and credible fiscal consolidation
remains a priority. An annual structural adjustment of about ½ percent of GDP over the medium term
would put debt firmly on a downward path, bringing it around 91.6 percent of GDP by 2021—
4 percentage points lower than under the baseline. Gross financing needs have declined below the
20 percent of GDP early warning benchmark and are projected to continue to fall gradually over the
medium term. However, at 16½ percent of GDP in 2021 they would remain among the highest in
the euro area.

A.

Public Debt Sustainability Analysis

Background
Definitions and coverage. Public debt comprises Excessive Deficit Procedure (EDP) debt in the
hands of the General Government. The General Government includes the Central Government,
Regional Governments, Local Governments, and Social Security Funds. It includes only those public
enterprises that are defined as part of General Government under European System of Accounts.
EDP debt is a subset of General Government consolidated debt (i.e., it does not include trade credits
and other accounts payable) and the stocks are recorded at their nominal value.
Developments. The public debt-to-GDP ratio increased from 35.5 percent of GDP in 2007 to
99.8 percent in 2015, driven by large fiscal deficits (of about 7¾ percent of GDP on average during
2008–15), and a largely unfavorable growth interest rate differential (which contributed by an annual
average of about 2½ percent of GDP). The support to the banking sector added about 4½ percent
of GDP to the public debt stock.
Gross financing needs have declined below 20 percent of GDP after peaking at 22 percent in 2012,
on the back of an ongoing maturity extension and nominal deficit reduction. The ECB’s quantitative
easing has helped bringing sovereign bond yields down. The 10-year bond yield has declined from
about 6¾ percent in mid-2012 to about 1.5 percent in November 2016. The effective interest rate
on outstanding debt has also declined, and interest payments are expected to fall below 3 percent
of GDP in 2016.
Other factors. The amortization profile of public debt is tilted towards the long term (82 percent of
total debt, on a residual maturity basis). The marginal life at issuance has increased steadily since
2012, from 5 years to over 9 years in 2015, with the average life of outstanding debt increasing from
6.2 to 6.6 years over the same period. Holdings of public debt are relatively well diversified. The

share held by the Spanish banking system has continued to fall to about 42½ percent, while that
of the ECB has increased to 7½ percent. The Eurosystem’s purchases under the public sector
purchases programme (PSPP) amounted to about EUR61 billion in 2015 (28 percent of the gross
financing needs). The share of public debt held by residents declined by 10 percentage points
since 2012 to 57½ by end-2015, but remains significantly above the 2007 level (50 percent). The
stock of financial assets has been increasing gradually since 2012, amounting to about 35 percent
of GDP in 2015. This constitutes a risk mitigating factor, with net public debt levels amounting to
80 percent of GDP.

Baseline
Public debt is projected to remain at 99.2 percent of GDP in 2017, before declining slowly to
95.6 percent by 2021. Gross financing needs are expected to remain below 20 percent, gradually
declining over the projection period. However, at 16½ percent of GDP in 2021, they would remain
relatively high compared to other euro area countries.
Assumptions. The baseline scenario is based on the medium-term projections (Table 1). In
particular, (i) growth is projected to remain at 3.2 percent in 2016 and moderate to 2.3 percent in
2017, as the effect of tailwinds dissipates; (ii) over the medium term, growth is set to converge
toward its potential rate of around 1½ percent; (iii) a structural adjustment of around ½ percent of
GDP in 2017, followed by a broadly neutral fiscal stance over the medium term in structural primary
terms; (iv) inflation (based on the GDP deflator) is projected to increase gradually from 0.5 percent in
2015 to 1½ percent in 2021; and (v) long-term sovereign spreads are assumed to increase slowly
from 1.2 percent in 2015 to 1.5 percent in the medium term, with 10-year bond yields increasing
moderately over the medium term in line with a gradual normalization of monetary policy.

Stress tests
Public debt levels would either remain broadly flat or increase under a number of standard shock
scenarios. Debt dynamics would worsen significantly in the event of a materialization of contingent
liabilities and in case the economy is hit by a combination of negative shocks to GDP growth and
the primary balance, with the stock of public debt peaking in 2018 at around 116½ percent of GDP
and 111 percent of GDP respectively.
Growth shock. In this scenario, real GDP growth rates are assumed to be lower than in the baseline
by one (10-year historical) standard deviation for two consecutive years, in 2017–18. This would
imply real GDP would decline on average by 0.5 percent per year, compared to annual average
growth of 2.2 percent under the baseline. Under this recession scenario, inflation would be lower
and the primary balance weaker (by about 2 percent of GDP per year, on average). In this context,
the debt-to-GDP ratio would raise substantially, reaching 109.8 percent of GDP in 2018 before
declining slowly to 106.6 percent in 2021 (11 percentage points higher than the baseline).
Meanwhile, gross financing needs would increase above the 20 percent benchmark level reaching
22.1 percent in 2018, due to the larger fiscal deficit.

58

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SPAIN

Primary balance shock. This scenario assumes a relaxation of fiscal policy in 2017–18, with a
cumulative deterioration of the primary balance of 4½ percent of GDP (that is, assuming a shock
equal to ½ the 10-year historical standard deviation of the primary balance-to-GDP ratio). Under
this scenario, the public debt-to-GDP ratio would continue to increase, peaking at 103.3 percent of
GDP in 2018 and then declining gradually to 100.3 percent in 2021, 4.7 percentage points higher
than in the baseline. The larger primary deficits would also imply more sizable gross financing
requirements than in the baseline, and would peak at 20.9 percent of GDP in 2018.
Interest rate shock. Over the five year forecast horizon, the debt dynamics could withstand
relatively well a nominal interest rate shock of about 240 basis points during 2017–21, given the
relatively long debt maturity and the high share of debt at fixed interest rates. Under such a
scenario, the effective interest rate would increase to 3.7 percent by 2021 compared to 2.7 percent
in the baseline. The debt-to-GDP ratio would remain broadly stable, amounting to 98.3 percent in
2021. However, a sizeable and sustained increase in interest rates would reduce the (already limited)
fiscal space.
Combined shock. A simultaneous combination of the previous three shocks would be particularly
adverse for public debt dynamics, mostly due to the impact of lower growth and higher primary
deficits. In this scenario, the public debt-to-GDP ratio would increase to 111.1 percent in 2018,
remaining at this high level through 2021 (almost 15 percentage points higher than under the
baseline). Gross financing needs would also be significantly higher, peaking at over 22.9 percent of
GDP in 2018.
Contingent liability shock. Large, negative unexpected events could put debt sustainability at risk.
A negative financial sector shock scenario, assuming a one-time increase in non-interest public
expenditures (in 2017) equivalent to 10 percent of banking sector assets, combined with lower
growth and lower inflation in 2017–18 (i.e., growth is reduced by 1 standard deviation) would be
particularly adverse for public debt dynamics. The materialization of such contingency liabilities
would raise the primary deficit to 10.9 percent of GDP in 2017, bringing gross financing needs to
28.7 percent of GDP (about 9 percentage points above standard early warning benchmark levels).
Moreover, the debt-to-GDP ratio would continue to increase, peaking at 116.5 percent in 2018, then
slowly declining to about 113.5 percent in 2021 (17.9 percentage points higher than the baseline).

Heat Map
Risks associated with public debt remain high as the benchmark level (85 percent of GDP) is
breached under the baseline scenario as well as in each of the shock scenarios. Gross financing
needs would remain below 20 percent of GDP under the baseline, but would surpass that
benchmark level in the case of output and primary balance shocks and the materialization of
contingent liabilities. Regarding the debt profile, risks stem from the high level of external financing
needs and—to a lesser extent—from the share of public debt held by non-residents.

B.

External Debt Sustainability Analysis1

While external debt is set to continue its gradual decline over the medium term, it will take time to
reach levels that significantly lower the vulnerability to external shocks. The currently low cost of debt,
favorable maturity structure, export and bank exposure diversification, and competiveness gains since
the crisis are mitigating factors.
Methodology. The external DSA provides a framework to examine a country’s external sustainability
that complements the External Sector Report (Appendix 2). The external DSA estimates the external
debt path under a number of alternative scenarios. While the assumptions are relatively mechanistic
and the estimates do not employ full-fledged alternative macroeconomic scenarios, they can
nevertheless provide useful insights on the potential impact of a range of shocks.
Baseline. As for the public DSA, the baseline scenario is based on the medium-term projections
(Table 1). In particular, it assumes a moderation of the Spanish real GDP growth recovery over the
medium term to its estimated potential growth rate of about 1½ percent of GDP. The trade balance
and current account are forecast to remain in surplus, somewhat above the 2015 levels. Driven by
continued strong export growth due to regained competitiveness, the external debt-to-export ratio
is projected to sharply decline (by over 132 percentage points) during 2016–21. After falling to
168 percent of GDP by end-2015, external debt and is projected to decline to 142 percent of GDP by
2021. At the same time, gross external financing needs will continue to decline in the projection
period but remain a vulnerability given their high level with around 61 percent of GDP by 2021.
Stress scenarios. The DSA scenarios suggest that Spain’s external debt will remain high but
continue to gradually decline over the medium term unless key macroeconomic variables return to
levels of the crisis episode. Overall, the external debt level remains a vulnerability given the sizable
external and domestic risks surrounding the Spanish economic recovery.
Historical shock scenario. The external debt path would fail to stabilize in a scenario based on
historical data properties. Assuming real GDP growth path of only 0.4 percent over the next five
years combined with a 1.2 percentage point higher nominal interest rate, would raise external debt
by more than 30 percent of GDP by 2021. Under such a shock the external debt-to-GDP ratio would
rise to 202 percent of GDP.
Interest rate shock.: In the case of a rather benign interest rate shock (an increase from 1.9 percent
in the baseline to 2.7 percent), external debt would rise only slightly (3 percentage points by 2021).
Real depreciation shock. A 30 percent real depreciation shock would have a similar impact as the
interest rate shock. In the external DSA, the mechanic transmission channel is via valuation effects,

1

Historical data revisions by the authorities explain the increase in external debt from 160.1 percent of GDP in 2014
(as reported in the 2015 Staff Report) to the currently reported value of 168.5 percent of GDP for the same year. This
one-off also affects the level of the projected external debt path.

60

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SPAIN

but Spain has a low share of debt denominated in foreign currency, so the increase in the debt ratio
would be small (2 percentage points of GDP).
Growth shock. Assuming that real GDP growth averages 0.6 percent, compared with 2 percent in
the baseline, external debt would be around 11 percent of GDP higher in 2021 (153 percent of GDP).
Combined shock. A similar elevated external debt path is obtained in the combined shock scenario,
which assumes one quarter standard deviation shocks to the real interest rate, real GDP growth rate,
and the current account balance. As a result, the external debt-to-GDP would be 12 percent higher
in 2021 at 154 percent of GDP.

An Extended External DSA
Methodology. Using estimated equations for export and import demand (see second chapter of
Selected Issues paper), the extended DSA incorporates some reduced form responses of the
components of the trade balance to specific shocks. While this is still not a full-fledged general
equilibrium exercise, it complements the standard external DSA presented above.2
Real appreciation shock. A 30 percent nominal appreciation of the Euro against the USD bilateral
exchange would appreciate the real effective exchange rate by about 8 percent, slowing down
export growth and thus reducing the trade balance to about 1/2 percent of GDP in the medium
term. This alone would result in an external debt of 6 percent by 2021. However, the revaluation
effect partially offsets this increase, with a resulting debt-to-GDP ratio of 149 percent by 2021.3
Oil price shock. A permanent reversion of the oil price to its 2001–15 average (US$ 66 per barrel) by
2017 would reduce the trade balance to 1.4 percent of GDP in the medium term, and external debt
would increase by 10 percentage points by 2021 relative to the baseline.
Global demand slow down shock. Assuming sustained weak global demand, in particular that
Spain’s trading partners’ import demand grows permanently by 1 percentage point less every year,
would lower’s Spain’s export growth. As a result, the medium-term trade balance would fall to
1.3 percent of GDP and external debt would increase by 10 percentage points relative to the
baseline.
Combined shock. A scenario that combines the EUR/USD appreciation, the oil price increase, and
the external demand deceleration would imply an external debt of 157 percent of GDP in 2021,
compared to the 142 percent of GDP in the baseline.

As in all other shocks, this partial equilibrium analysis ignores the effect on GDP growth that the shock may have.

1/ Public sector is defined as general government.
2/ Based on available data.
3/ Long-term bond spread over German bonds.
4/ Defined as interest payments divided by debt stock (excluding guarantees) at the end of previous year.
5/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;
a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
6/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
7/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as ae(1+r).
8/ Includes asset changes and interest revenues (if any). For projections, includes exchange rate changes during the projection period.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels of the last projection year.

5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.

4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.

3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.

2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic currency (e > 0) and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).

e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.

1/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; r = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms, g = real GDP growth rate,

Statement by the Staff Representative on the Spain
January 27, 2017

This statement provides information that has become available since the issuance of the staff
report on January 12, 2017. The thrust of the staff appraisal remains unchanged.
1.
CPI inflation accelerated in December, and real GDP growth in 2016 may have been
slightly higher than projected. The marked rise in inflation in December to 1.6 percent
(year-over-year), from 0.7 percent in November, reflects mostly higher energy prices. Core
inflation edged up to 1.0 percent in December, 0.2 percentage points higher than in
November. As a result, the average inflation outturn for 2016 was slightly higher
(-0.2 percent) than previously estimated. Base effects, along with possible further oil price
rises, create upside risks to the 2017 inflation projection. High frequency indicators for
December, including a stronger manufacturing PMI and continued solid employment
growth, also point to sustained strong economic activity that could have put 2016 annual
real GDP growth slightly beyond the estimated 3.2 percent.
2.
The government is launching several policy initiatives. Following the European
Court of Justice ruling that nullified abusive variable-interest mortgage contracts with floor
clauses, the government has issued a decree to establish a mediation mechanism that would
facilitate the settlement between banks and borrowers, reducing the burden of the court
system that needs to rule whether individual mortgage contracts are abusive. The government
has also announced its intention to task the fiscal council (AIReF) with conducting an
expenditure review. Moreover, the central government and most regional governments
agreed to seek reforms for the regional financing system, with an expert commission to be
formed in one month.

Statement by Mr. Jorge Dajani, Alternate Executive Director for Spain, Ms.
Sanchez Rodriguez and Mr. Lopez, Advisors to the Executive Director
January 27, 2017

We thank Ms. Schaechter and her team for the candid dialogue held during the mission, for the
congruence of views and for their hard work on the staff report, including the four selected
issues papers. We agree with their assessment that bold structural reforms have laid the ground
for Spain’s current recovery, and that it is essential to preserve them and continue to make
further progress. We also agree with the many constructive and useful economic policy
recommendations, which are broadly in line with the authorities’ goals.
Moreover, we are pleased that the staff report recognizes that “the priorities of the new
government are preserving earlier reform achievements and meeting short-term fiscal
commitments under the Stability and Growth Pact.” Although under a minority government,
there is broad political consensus about several policy priorities and reforms that can support
growth in the immediate future and more importantly, raise Spain’s growth potential to higher
levels.
Economic performance
Throughout 2016 Spain continued the expansionary trend that started three years ago,
outperforming the Eurozone and the world’s largest economies. Real GDP growth will be at
least 3.2 percent in 2016, and by mid-2017 the economy should have recovered pre-crisis
income levels. We agree with staff that growth forecasts for the subsequent years will remain
over 2 percent despite some deceleration coming from milder tailwinds. The staff report
correctly highlights that Spain has managed to achieve this “impressive recovery” thanks to
sound economic policies and structural reforms which have contributed to raise short-term
growth, growth potential and confidence. This economic turnaround has also allowed the
ongoing correction of Spain’s main external and internal imbalances under a more sustainable
growth model.
Labor market
The 2012 labor market reform is a case in point. It improved labor dynamics, allowing for wage
moderation and eventually lowered the GDP growth threshold for net employment creation
from 2 percent to around 0.7 percent. In the last two years, more than 1 million net jobs have
been created. Spain is currently creating around 500,000 net jobs per year on average, with
employment growing at rates over 3 percent year-on-year since 2015. This recovery has driven
down the unemployment rate by 8 p.p. from its peak, with youth and long-term unemployment

2
continuing to fall. Moreover, as staff rightly acknowledges, job creation has helped to reduce
inequality in Spain since 2014.
Measures to reduce duality and to make permanent contracts more attractive are paying off, as
almost half of total job creation among wage-earners is already permanent. The prospects for
the long-term unemployed keep improving, with flows out of unemployment gradually
strengthening for this group.
We also agree with staff’s assessment that there is no room for complacency: job creation
remains the key challenge for the Spanish economy. Staff correctly points out that it is essential
to safeguard the reforms, and that there is scope to continue improving the functioning of the
labor market, especially in the field of active labor market policies.
External sector
Spain is expected to record in 2016 a current account surplus for the fourth year in a row; never
before in recent history had Spain experienced subsequent external surpluses, especially
relevant in the context of high economic growth. The IMF expects a surplus of 2 percent in
2016, highlighting that “sustained and healthy export growth reflects regained competitiveness
arising from price and wage moderation and larger firm’s internationalization efforts.” Net
exports are currently contributing to economic growth, and the share of exports to GDP is
almost ten percentage points higher than before the crisis. In fact, Spain has shifted from being
a net borrower to a net lender, and will record in 2016 its fifth consecutive year with lending
capacity to the rest of the world.
This accumulation of external surpluses is finally being reflected in the reduction of the
negative NIIP despite adverse valuation effects. As these effects subside, and given that current
account surpluses are expected to continue, the NIIP is set to improve further. Although we
agree with staff’s views that this external vulnerability needs to be further addressed, a number
of mitigating factors should be taken into account: the NIIP has a large debt related FDI
component (20 percent of GDP), and significant large gross equity liabilities (60 percent of
GDP); debt is mainly denominated in domestic currency and its maturity is predominantly long
term; as for assets, they are diversified. Both staff and the authorities expect the NIIP to
continue improving in the coming years.
Financial sector
The authorities agree with staff’s assessment on the financial sector: the banking system has
gained further strength due to better asset quality, stronger capital and funding positions and
reduced debt overhangs. The system is closer to putting most of the crisis legacies behind it and
NPLs, which show a downward trend, are well provisioned. Furthermore, the dynamics of bank
credit are supportive of private sector deleveraging, while facilitating new credit flows.
Challenges ahead include the low profitability environment and new regulatory initiatives,

3
which are shared with the rest of the European banking sector. The authorities look forward to
the upcoming 2017 FSAP, which will be concluded by next September.
Private sector deleveraging
The deleveraging process of the private sector has been particularly intensive; non-consolidated
private sector debt has fallen by 50 percentage points since 2010, almost converging with the
euro area average in the third quarter of 2016. Corporate indebtedness has fallen below the euro
area average and household debt has decreased by almost 20 p.p., standing slightly above the
euro area level. More importantly, this deleveraging process has been compatible with new
loans to SMEs and households. As the IMF correctly states, “the stronger banking system has
been broadly supportive of the economic recovery, with financial conditions having eased
further.”
Fiscal policy
Fiscal consolidation has played an important role in restoring confidence. Over the last years
Spain has delivered one of the largest fiscal adjustments in the Eurozone, against the backdrop
of a severe recession. According to IMF projections, public deficit will stand at 4.5 percent of
GDP in 2016 and 3.2 percent in 2017, broadly in line with the authorities’ views. With the
support of other political parties, the government has approved fiscal measures amounting to
more than €7 billion for 2017, including, among others, increases in the CIT tax base, increases
in excise taxes and improvements in tax collection. The European Commission estimates that
these measures will yield an adjusted fiscal structural effort of 0.7 percent of GDP, thus
continuing with the consolidation process initiated a few years ago. With all these measures,
included in the updated Draft Budgetary Plan of Spain, the European Commission considers
that Spain is broadly compliant with the provisions of the Stability and Growth Pact. The
negotiation of a new budget for 2017 is now under way, and the government is committed to
deliver the fiscal targets for 2017. Unlike the IMF, we do not foresee any need to raise VAT in
the future, as the implementation of the spending rule should be sufficient to bring down the
deficit to equilibrium in structural terms going forward.
The public debt to GDP ratio peaked in 2014 and both the IMF and the authorities expect it to
come down to around 99 percent of GDP in 2017 and decline further in the coming years. The
debt reduction strategy is based on an adequate fiscal consolidation path and the government’s
full commitment to comply with the objectives of the Stability and Growth Pact.
Productivity
We concur with staff on the need to raise productivity, particularly for SMEs, through
structural reforms. The authorities are committed to guaranteeing continuous implementation of
the Market Unity Law, curbing red tape and market fragmentation, improving SMEs’

4
financing, corporate governance and competition. Similarly, there is consensus on the need to
support SME growth, which should help to foster R&D investment and the export capacity of
companies. The authorities are very appreciative of the analytical work made by staff regarding
competitiveness, productivity and the impact on growth of structural reforms, which is
estimated to be 2.5 p.p. in the next five years.
Economic policy and priorities
Going forward, the strong recovery of the Spanish economy does not imply that risks or
challenges have disappeared. In fact, as the staff report points out, external risks have not
abated and there are stock imbalances, such as high unemployment and high public debt, which
take time to be fully addressed and therefore deserve full attention by the authorities.
On this issue, we understand staff’s concerns that political fragmentation could pose challenges
to rekindling momentum for structural reforms and fiscal consolidation. However, the
significant number of reforms and measures announced by the new Government and the main
political partners since last December point to a reformist agenda. Some of these measures have
not been included in the staff report due to the cut-off date, and they are relevant in structural
terms.
Aside from the fiscal measures already mentioned, the recent Draft Budgetary Plan includes
plans to mandate the independent fiscal authority to conduct a thorough expenditure review at
all levels of the administration. An expert committee on pension reform will be set up and
Parliament will debate its main findings in the coming months. Similarly, a high level working
group on regional financing will be established with a view to a new regional financial
framework within one year. In the financial sector, a Royal Decree Law has been recently
adopted by the Council of Ministers establishing a new out-of-court procedure to facilitate a
smooth resolution of claims related with non-transparent floor clauses. Moreover, the
Government has announced reforms to the current Law on Mortgages which will improve
consumer protection.
After months of political uncertainty, a new government is finally in place. The
impressive achievements of the Spanish economy in the last few years, as highlighted by
the staff report, are the result of an ambitious structural reform program coupled with
fiscal consolidation, which have allowed the economy to reap the full benefits of
tailwinds, regaining the competitiveness lost, largely correcting its macroeconomic
imbalances and fostering confidence in the future.
