Staff Report for the 2010 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2010 Consultation with Barbados
(In consultation with other departments)
Approved by David J. Robinson and James Roaf

Executive Summary


Background. The global economic crisis has hit Barbados severely by choking tourism inflows
and limiting offshore activity. GDP declined 5 percent in 2009 and an estimated 1 percent in the
first half of 2010. External borrowing and the SDR allocation enabled an increase in international
reserves. The public debt reached 110 percent of GDP in FY 2009/10, nonperforming loans have
risen significantly, and the collapse of CLICO and BAICO has hurt the insurance sector.



Focus of consultation. Within the context of a projected gradual recovery, the discussions focused
on (i) the critical need to bring the public debt-to-GDP ratio down over the medium term; (ii) the
health of the banking sector; (iii) measures to resolve CLICO Barbados; and (iv) reforms to
strengthen supervision and regulation of the nonbank financial sector. The staff made the following
recommendations:
 Fiscal policy: Go beyond the planned expenditure controls and raise VAT and corporate tax
rates while widening their base to first stabilize and then put the public debt on a firm
downward path as a ratio to GDP.
 Monetary policy: A decisive fiscal adjustment would help to contain pressures on the
exchange rate peg, while monetary policy rates should be set to manage capital flows.
 Financial sector policy: Intensify monitoring and reporting requirements; conduct regular
stress tests and strengthen prudential regulation for banks; reform the regulatory and
supervisory framework of nonbank financial institutions; and resolve CLICO and BAICO.



Authorities’ views. The authorities agreed with the thrust of these recommendations. In particular,
they agreed with the staff’s view that a deeper fiscal adjustment would bring less disruption to
economic activity than an unsustainable public debt. They are planning to have the new Financial
Services Commission up and running by the spring of 2011.



Exchange system. The Barbados dollar has been pegged to the U.S. dollar at the rate of
BDS$2.00 = US$1.00 since 1975. Barbados has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections
2, 3, and 4, and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on current account transactions.
While the real exchange rate is not far from its estimated equilibrium, it is somewhat overvalued
and efforts should be intensified to address risks to external stability from large fiscal imbalances.



Mission. The team that visited Bridgetown during September 12–24 comprised Marcello Estevão
(head), Gamal El-Masry and Carla Macario (all WHD) and John Ralyea (FIN). John Rolle (OED)
participated in several meetings.

I. BACKGROUND
1.
The global crisis hit Barbados front and center. Output is expected to have
contracted by a cumulative 6 percent from late 2007 through end-2010, with widespread
weakness across all major economic activities, especially tourism, financial services, and real
estate. Indeed, the fact that the global recession originated in the U.S. and U.K. financial

has generally been higher than in key competitor markets in the last few years.

Box 1. Tourism Developments
Since the onset of the global slowdown in late 2007, Barbados’s large tourism sector has
contracted considerably. About 40 percent of value added is either directly or indirectly
related to tourism. In addition to hotels and restaurants, the core tourism activity drives to a
large extent the activity in

and it has bounced back in the
first half of 2010.
Looking ahead, airlift expansion and greater diversification will be critical in developing
tourist markets. The recent experience with the Canadian and U.S. markets shows that
expanding airlift capacity is key to attracting new customers. Indeed, the recent increase in
arrivals from both countries can be traced to new air carriers linking Western Canada and New
York to Barbados with nonstop flights. In addition, a recent direct flight from Brazil and
forthcoming direct flights from Dallas (Texas) and Germany will open up new markets for
Barbados.
Fiscal consolidation in key tourist markets will hurt tourism activity in Barbados. As
Europe and North America tighten fiscal policies, consumers’ disposable income, and thus
tourism demand, will grow slowly. Moreover, the recently introduced Airline Passenger Duty
in the United Kingdom—officially presented as an environmental tax—has raised the tax per
ticket to the Caribbean in two steps from £40.00 to £75.00 effective November 1, with twice
as much charged for travel in premium class.

5
Box 2. The Authorities’ Response to the Recession
Soon after the first signs of the economic downturn became visible in 2008, the
authorities implemented a number of countercyclical measures to protect employment
and minimize the impact of the recession on the most vulnerable groups:


The Tourism Investment Relief Fund was set up in 2009 to encourage the renovation
of tourism-related facilities through the provision of public loans, loan guarantees, and
grants;



An employment stabilization scheme was introduced in 2009 to allow employers to
defer for one year their contribution to the National Insurance Scheme (NIS) provided
that they maintain their employment levels;



On the social front, old-age benefits were increased, free transportation was introduced
on public buses for all school children, a training fund was established by the NIS to
retrain workers who lost their jobs, and more recently, unemployment benefits paid out
by the NIS were extended from 26 weeks to 40 weeks to cover the longer-term
unemployed; and

Large capital projects were encouraged or undertaken directly by government agencies. These
included the construction of two large office buildings by the NIS for later lease to the
government, infrastructure projects by the Barbados Water Authority to install and replace
main water and sewage pipes, and a loan guarantee provided by the central government to
private financiers and developers to restart the prominent Four-Seasons Hotel and Villas
project on the West Coast.

The fiscal accounts have deteriorated significantly, adding to trend increases in
the debt-to-GDP ratio. Tax revenue, particularly corporate income taxes and VAT, declined
considerably in FY09/10, reflecting sharply lower economic activity, while current spending
eased only marginally. Moreover, despite adjustment in some public service tariffs last year,
public enterprises as a whole continue to accumulate large losses and remain a burden on the
government budget, drawing direct transfers and loan guarantees. As a result, the central
government deficit widened from 5 percent of GDP in FY2008/09 to more than 9 percent in
FY2009/10, adding to the deterioration of the public accounts due to the steady increase in
central government current spending

5.
In an effort to stem the rising debt, authorities issued a “Medium-Term Fiscal
Strategy” (MTFS) in March. The strategy aims at reducing the overall fiscal deficit and
generating a balanced budget by 2014/15 and a surplus by 2015/16, while keeping economic
growth to acceptable levels by focusing on foreign exchange earning sectors. The authorities
proposed improving tax administration, and containing the growth of the wage bill and of
transfers (including to public health, education, and transportation providers). In addition, they
intend to substitute expensive foreign private loans with cheaper multilateral financing to
improve debt dynamics. They expect that the fiscal adjustment would bring down the public
debt-to-GDP ratio by about 14 percentage points in five years, with further steady
improvements thereafter. 1
6.
The weakness in the external sector has put pressure on foreign reserves.
Depressed tourism proceeds and high commodity prices more than doubled the current
account deficit to 9.6 percent of GDP in 2008. However, a recession-induced contraction in
imports outpaced a further fall in tourism and export revenues, narrowing the deficit to
5.5 percent of GDP in 2009. The relatively high deficits, along with a collapse in long-term
private sector inflows, put pressure on foreign reserves under the long-standing pegged
exchange rate regime. In 2009, the authorities issued US$120 million in external bonds and
got US$85 million in SDR allocations. By the end of 2010, under current plans, the authorities
would have borrowed an additional net amount of US$145 million.2 In the absence of foreign
borrowing and the SDR allocations, foreign reserves would have halved in two years.
7.
The real exchange rate, while somewhat overvalued, is broadly in line with
fundamentals (Selected Issues Paper, Chapter II). Staff analysis suggests that Barbados’ real
effective exchange rate, which has appreciated 13 percent over the last 24 months relative to
its main competitors, exceeds its equilibrium rate by 5 to 10 percent. The current level of
foreign reserves could be considered adequate under several criteria but others point to the
need for further accumulation of reserves. In addition, Barbados’ share of the Caribbean
tourism market slipped in 2009. However, concerns about overvaluation and possible losses in
competitiveness of the Barbadian economy may be mitigated somewhat by Barbados’ focus
on high-end tourism, which could be less price sensitive than other tourism segments.

1

In October 2010, S&P downgraded Barbados’ debt to BBB- from BBB (although it remains investment grade)
because of its negative dynamics. The ratings agency kept the country on a stable outlook, given low debtrollover risks and the authorities’ commitment to fiscal adjustment.
2

In June 2010, the authorities borrowed US$100 million (to be repaid in December 2010) using the proceeds to
repay a maturing bond of US$100 million. Later in the summer, they successfully placed a US$200 million bond
in New York with a 12-year maturity and 7.2 percent interest rate. In October, a US$45-million loan was
approved by the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB).

The banking system is showing strains from the recession. The Barbadian banking
sector, which consists of six foreign institutions, remains well capitalized, although several
indicators have deteriorated in recent months. Non-performing loans increased on average to

Offshore financial institutions have contracted and stock market activity has
stalled, but credit unions appear resilient to the crisis. Assets of offshore institutions fell
from 11 times GDP in 2007 to 9 times GDP in 2009, and the sector’s contribution to fiscal
revenues has declined. At the same time, stock trading dropped from 7 percent of GDP in
2007 to less than ½ percent of GDP in 2009, and has declined further so far in 2010. The
available information suggests that credit unions have faced the economic downturn without
severe difficulties, although membership has contracted and non-performing loans remain
high.

3

IMF staff is currently collaborating with Barbados’ central bank staff to perform a full-fledged stress test of the
entire banking system. The preliminary stress test done so far was based on migrating up to 100 percent of loans
in a given classification category to the next lower one. Under this shock scenario, the capital adequacy ratio of
individual banks fell by as much as 4 percentage points, but remained well above the regulatory 8-percent
threshold.

9
10.
The insurance sector faced a major crisis. In 2008, Trinidad and Tobago’s
CL Financial saw the value of its assets plummet, due in part to losses in real estate
investments in Florida and in methanol production. In February 2009, the government of
Barbados acknowledged difficulties in CL Financial’s domestic subsidiary, CLICO-Barbados.
Of CLICO-Barbados’ three business lines, the mortgage business has been sold and
negotiations to sell the general insurance business are in train. In contrast, CLICO’s lifeinsurance arm has sizeable net liabilities, currently estimated at about 3¼ percent of GDP. To
provide liquidity, the central bank deposited US$5 million into CLICO’s mortgage subsidiary
in early 2009 and granted access to a special credit window, while an oversight committee was
set up to conduct the resolution process. Another affiliate of CL Financial, British American
Insurance Corporation (BAICO), was recently put under judicial management. The
government will soon request the appointment of a judicial manager for CLICO.
II. OUTLOOK AND RISKS
11.
The outlook is for a gradual recovery with some downside risks around it. Staff
expects a marginal output contraction in 2010 and a moderate recovery in 2011 and onwards
with growth rates of 2½–3 percent. The projected recovery, which is weak when taking into
account the deep contraction of the past two years, is consistent with forecasts of anemic
recoveries and persistently high

Inflation is projected to moderate

After the blip in 2010, more stable fuel prices

addition, private employers have indicated
that it is becoming increasingly difficult to

face of continued weak foreign and domestic demand for goods and services. Thus, as
countercyclical programs wane—and absent a more vigorous economic recovery to close the
output gap—unemployment is expected to rise above 11 percent in 2011, a level not seen
since the late 1990s, before receding slowly toward historical averages.
13.
External headwinds will continue to weigh on the balance of payments in the
medium term under the current policy stance. The current account is projected to widen in
2010 to 7.9 percent of GDP, despite a projected two-percent increase in tourism revenues. The
large external borrowing volumes in 2010 are unlikely to be sufficient to offset the
deterioration in the trade balance, and reserves are projected to fall to 4.2 months of imports
by the end of the year from 4.6 months of imports at end-2009. In the absence of policy
changes or significant new borrowing, foreign reserves are projected to fall to just over two
months of imports in 2015. In addition, current and projected future reserves fall short of
covering 100 percent of short-term debt on a remaining-maturity basis.

14.
The medium-term outlook hinges crucially on the authorities’ ability to deliver
fiscal consolidation and on improved structural conditions to growth. Staff projects that
the public debt could rise by about 10 to 15 percent of GDP over the next five years without
measures to bring the public deficit down in a sustainable manner. That could increase
uncertainty about debt sustainability and reinforce existing pressures on foreign reserves.
Contingent liabilities from CLICO (and possibly BAICO) and from government guarantees to
construction projects would add to this negative scenario. The MTFS aims at reversing this
situation, which could be helped by reforms to raise trend growth in the country.
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Fiscal Policy
15.
The mission supported a decisive fiscal adjustment strategy that would first
stabilize and then put the debt-to-GDP ratio on a downward path. As a small, open
economy, the level of economic activity in Barbados is ultimately determined by global
conditions. Thus, the mission took the view that a strong fiscal consolidation effort would
have a small effect on economic growth when compared to the larger impact from negative

11
debt dynamics and risks around it. Indeed, reduced market confidence in Barbados’ ability to
consolidate the fiscal accounts could potentially result in loss of access to external debt
markets and much lower medium-term growth. The staff stressed, however, that the fiscal
adjustment needs to be done in a way that—to the extent possible—protects the poor and
limits its adverse impact on growth. To that end, the staff considered Barbados’ tradition of
cooperation between labor unions, employers, and government as a great asset.
16.
The mission broadly agreed with the targets set forth by the authorities’ fiscal
adjustment strategy, but argued for stronger revenue measures to reach them. Consistent
with the MTFS, the FY 2010/11 budget relies mainly on controlling public sector wages,
transfers, and capital spending to produce a small, ½ percent of GDP improvement in the
primary fiscal balance. However, preliminary data suggest that tax revenues for the beginning
of the budget year have been much weaker than expected, putting at risk the planned modest
adjustment for the year. Looking ahead, under the team’s economic assumptions, the
expenditure controls, improved debt management, and consolidation of tax revenue agencies
listed in the MTFS would not suffice to achieve the authorities’ medium-term targets. For that,
a possible set of measures, including concrete actions to improve revenue collection, could
include:


On the revenue side, an increase in the VAT rate by 3 percentage points to 18 percent,
combined with base broadening by eliminating many exemptions and zero ratings, and
improvements in tax administration. The staff also recommended raising the corporate
tax rate (from 2 to 3 percent) and reducing exemptions over the medium term,
particularly for offshore operations.



On the expenditure side, bringing down public sector wages and spending on goods
and services to their mid-2000s ratio to GDP. Staff also recommended adjusting tariffs
for public utilities and services to improve the financial situation of loss-making public
enterprises, thus allowing the government to cut transfers to them.



All these measures should be combined with well-targeted transfers to vulnerable
social groups to alleviate the impact of the fiscal adjustment. The adjustment could be
calibrated to leave space for moderate increases in capital spending to support
medium-term growth.
125

17.
The illustrative adjustment scenario
would put public debt on a stable, downward
trajectory, thus bolstering domestic and
external stability. The cumulative impact of the
suggested measures would be to strengthen the
consolidated government budget from a deficit of
7.3 percent of GDP in FY2009/10 to a 2 percent
surplus in FY2015/16. Thus, total public debt,
after peaking in FY2010/11 at 114 percent of

GDP, would gradually fall to just over 100 percent of GDP by the end of the projection period,
steadily improving thereafter, as broadly intended in the MTFS (Appendix I). Compared with
the baseline scenario, public debt would be about 20 percentage points of GDP lower. Weaker
pressure from government deficits and overall slower wage growth (including by the possible
signaling effect from low wage growth in the public sector to private sector wages) would
reduce the growth of imports. Thus, the

imports. Bound and stress tests confirm
that the downward trajectory of the public debt would be sustained under most standardized
shocks —such as an interest rate hike or exchange rate devaluation (Appendix I)—but debt
sustainability will remain vulnerable until debt ratios decline much further in the longer run.
18.
Authorities agreed that the fiscal adjustment needs to be deepened. In particular,
they agreed with a combination of stronger revenue measures and further spending cuts
starting this budget year. However, they showed some reluctance to perform major changes in
the tax code without further studies, including with the help of CARTAC. The authorities
reiterated their commitment to maintain only moderate growth in public wages and salaries
and reduce transfers to quasi-public enterprises, while highlighting their efforts to reform the
public sector and raise its efficiency, including in state-owned enterprises.
B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
19.
The mission argued against further declines in policy interest rates, as the effect
on economic activity is uncertain, while pressures on reserves could increase. The staff
noted that capital controls are being applied liberally in Barbados and are not too restrictive,
serving primarily to smooth currency

13
core economies, given usual country spreads, thus exacerbating pressures on foreign reserves
and the exchange rate peg.
20.
The authorities agreed that the impact of changes in the deposit rate on real
activity is fairly modest. They are currently setting the minimum deposit rate to maintain a
reasonable spread vis-à-vis the U.S. federal fund rates, thus managing pressures on foreign
reserves. However, the authorities stated that the low deposit rates have translated into
somewhat lower lending rates (albeit not one-to-one) and contributed to alleviate balancesheet pressures on households.
21.
Staff argued that fiscal adjustment was the best policy to stem pressures on the
real exchange rate. The authorities reiterated their strong commitment to the 2-to-1 peg to the
U.S. dollar, which has been in place since 1975 and has served as an effective nominal anchor
to the Barbadian economy. In this context, the authorities agreed with the staff that a decisive
fiscal adjustment path is essential to protect the peg.
C. Financial Sector Policies
22.
Staff pointed out that the deterioration in some of the financial soundness
indicators begs closer supervision. The significant increase in nonperforming loans in
recent months (and the likely further increase going forward, even in a baseline scenario of a
steady recovery, due to usual lagged effects) could pose risks to the financial sector and the
economy. This said, staff noted the banking system’s high capital ratio, which, according to
work from an MCM technical assistance mission in early September, would remain well
above the regulatory threshold under plausible additional stress.
23.
The authorities stressed that the structure of Barbados’ banking system and the
currently intensified bank supervision are sources of resilience. Large and stable
Canadian banks account for more than 70 percent of banking assets with the remaining
market share accounted for by large regional banks. Moreover, officials pointed out that these
institutions have a long-term commitment to the country, which was confirmed by bank
representatives who view the deterioration of financial conditions mainly as a cyclical
phenomenon. Central bank staff has intensified monitoring and reporting requirements, and
has stepped-up onsite inspections, focusing on credit risk. They are encouraging banks to
carry out stress tests, including by posting guidelines on the central bank’s website. The
central bank has also set up a financial stability unit that will carry out quarterly stress tests
and analytical studies.
24.
The authorities are reinforcing the regulatory framework for the banking system,
but staff suggested further improvements in provisioning requirements. Officials are
drafting regulations for prompt corrective action and have signed MOUs with Canadian
supervisors to facilitate cross-border coordination among regulators. They are participating in
a regional college of regulators to coordinate the consolidated supervision of commercial
banks based in Barbados. The authorities are also moving forward with changes in regulation
and legislation to introduce some of the recommendations of the 2008 FSAP Update

14
(Appendix II). The staff noted that provisioning levels were low, and reiterated the FSAP
suggestion that requirements be upgraded to international practices.
25.
The authorities are discussing different strategies for resolving CLICO-Barbados,
but are waiting for more information about BAICO. Discussions revolved around a
resolution plan that addresses the statutory gap in CLICO Life, while protecting small
individual investors. The authorities are aware of CLICO-Barbados’ net liabilities in other
countries in the region. The fiscal costs of such a plan would be bound by CLICO-Life’s net
liabilities of 3¼ percent of GDP and would ultimately depend on the extent that liabilities to
larger investors are guaranteed. 4 More concrete information and actions will be available as
the work of the judicial managers of CLICO-Barbados and BAICO progresses.
26.
Staff voiced concerns about the quality of insurance sector supervision. The
authorities stated that they are strengthening regulation and supervision of nonbank financial
institutions. They are moving forward with the consolidation of the supervision of onshore and
offshore nonbank financial institutions into the planned Financial Services Commission
(FSC). This commission—which would bring under one umbrella the supervision of
insurance, credit unions, securities and international business—is scheduled to be in place by
next spring. Staff noted that better and more timely information on nonbank financial
institutions would improve transparency and provide better market discipline to the sector.
D. Structural Issues
27.
Staff argued for measures to raise Barbados’ low productivity growth. Barbados
seems to have a relatively good business environment, as attested by the Competitiveness
Index from the World Economic Forum, which ranks Barbados at the top of CARICOM and
fifth in the Western Hemisphere. However, staff estimates that total factor productivity has
been declining in the country, which has welfare consequences and makes it more difficult to
consolidate the fiscal accounts in a sustainable manner. While the causes for this poor
performance are not clear, improving the efficiency of government services, including by
consolidating agencies with complementary mandates and alleviating the bureaucratic burden
on the private sector, would be steps in the right direction.
28.
Officials view facilitating private sector investment and diversifying tourism
sources as key to raising economic efficiency and growth. As examples, they highlighted
(i) the government project for an underwater pipeline to pump natural gas from Trinidad to
4

Other countries in the region have a range of strategies to resolve CLICO. In Trinidad and Tobago, the budget
proposed a restructuring plan that would pay investors up to a threshold of US$ 12,000, and would apply a
haircut in NPV terms to the remaining liabilities. The plan is being reviewed after it met with considerable
opposition from investors, including credit unions. In the Bahamas, the judicial manager is still trying to liquidate
assets and is exploring selling the life insurance portfolio. Guyana is financing the payout of CLICO liabilities
mainly with a Caribbean Petroleum Fund of US$15 million, but that would not cover the National Insurance
System, which had gross investments in CLICO equivalent to about 2¼ percent of GDP.

15
Barbados, to be financed entirely by private capital, which would lower energy costs and
carbon emissions; and (ii) recent efforts to access tourism source markets in Brazil and Asia.
Officials remarked on the difficulties that they sometimes face from exogenous forces, citing
as an example the new tax on airline travel imposed in the United Kingdom.
E. Statistical Issues
29.
Remaining data issues hinder optimal surveillance of the Barbados’ economy. The
authorities published revised national accounts (done with the support of CARTAC),
producing a better picture of nominal GDP growth and levels. However, this welcome revision
needs to be supplemented by official estimates of price deflators, and a consistent real GDP
series, which currently is calculated by the central bank still using the old national accounts
framework. Moreover, timely data on the financial situation of state-owned enterprises would
allow a better assessment of the state of public finances. More granular information on banks’
assets, liabilities, and capital composition would improve the CBB’s ability to monitor the
health of the banking system.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
30.
While the global crisis hit Barbados front and center, the outlook is for a gradual
recovery. Output will still contract in 2010, but at a much slower rate than in 2009. Looking
ahead, the recovery should be gradual with some downside risks due to uncertainties about the
strength of economic activity in core economies, including protractedly high unemployment
rates. Foreign reserves would remain under pressure, although government borrowing
provides a protective cushion.
31.
The major challenge ahead is to put the public debt on a steady declining path to
support both domestic and external stability. Economic activity in Barbados is ultimately
determined by global conditions, thus, fiscal policy should focus squarely on bringing the
debt-to-GDP ratio down in the medium term. The MTFS sets out a welcome commitment to
adjustment that, nonetheless, should be strengthened by concrete actions to improve revenue
collection. An increase in VAT and corporate tax rates, while broadening the tax base, would
be important steps in the right direction. On the expenditure side—very much in the spirit of
the MTFS—public sector wages and spending on goods and services could be brought down
to their mid-2000s ratios to GDP. Increases in tariffs for public utilities and services would
allow further cuts in government transfers to quasi-public enterprises. These measures should
be combined with well-targeted transfers to vulnerable social groups to alleviate the impact of
the fiscal adjustment and with moderate increases in capital spending to support medium-term
growth.
32.
A decisive fiscal adjustment is the best way to protect the exchange rate peg, while
the current monetary stance is broadly appropriate. The peg to the U.S. dollar has worked
as an effective nominal anchor for the past 35 years, but staff estimates suggest that the real
exchange rate is somewhat overvalued. Ongoing fiscal pressures are at the heart of the
problem and fiscal adjustment is the best policy for improving medium-term reserve dynamics

16
and protecting the peg, including by reinforcing Barbados’ status as a desirable destination for
foreign capital. The minimum deposit rate should continue to be set with an eye to prevent
misalignments vis-à-vis policy rates in core economies, given usual country spreads, thus
avoiding disruptive capital movements.
33.
Banks remain healthy, but tighter regulations are needed. The significant increase
in nonperforming loans in recent months (and the likely further increase going forward) poses
risks to the financial sector, although banks’ high capital ratios serve as effective cushions. In
addition, Barbados’ banking system is comprised of large and stable international institutions,
which is a source of great resilience. Despite these factors, the central bank should continue its
intensified monitoring of the banking system—now facilitated by its new financial stability
unit—including by performing periodic stress tests. Provisioning requirements should be
upgraded to international practices and banks should be asked to provide more granular
information about their loan portfolio.
34.
Supervision of nonbank financial institutions needs to be revamped. The
bankruptcy of two important insurance companies illustrates the weaknesses in the
supervisory framework. Consolidating the supervision of onshore and offshore nonbank
financial institutions into the planned Financial Services Commission (FSC), as well as
improving human capital in this area would be steps in the right direction. Better and timelier
information on nonbank financial institutions would improve transparency and provide more
effective market discipline to the sector. Smooth and swift resolutions of CLICO and BAICO
would lift the uncertainty in the sector and on the size of contingent fiscal liabilities.
35.
Low productivity growth is an obstacle to better life quality in Barbados. Despite
relatively good business conditions, staff estimates that total factor productivity growth is
quite low in the country, which has welfare consequences and makes it more difficult to
consolidate the fiscal accounts in a sustainable manner. Improving the efficiency of
government services, including by consolidating agencies with complementary mandates and
alleviating the bureaucratic burden on the private sector, would help to boost productivity
growth. Channeling private capital to investments that would lower the cost of living and
producing in the country would also increase economic efficiency. Going beyond raising
productivity growth, a more diversified tourism industry would boost the country’s resilience
to regional shocks and open up new sources of medium-term growth.
36.

It is recommended to hold the next consultation on the standard 12-month cycle.

Appendix I. Illustrative Scenarios and Debt Sustainability Analyses (DSAs)

The staff conducted debt sustainability analyses based on two medium-term scenarios.
The baseline scenario assumes current policies would be broadly maintained for the
foreseeable future; while the adjustment scenario assumes that a number of corrective
measures would be implemented, beginning in FY 2011/12 (April to March) and continuing
over the 5-year projection period.
A. Key Assumptions and Scenarios
Both the baseline and adjustment scenarios rely on a number of common assumptions.
These include a stable exchange-rate peg, and a recovery, albeit sluggish, in the global
demand for Barbados’s goods and services from 2011 onwards. Both scenarios also assume
that there will be no additional costs to the budget arising from the resolution of the problems
surrounding CLICO-Barbados. On the external side, it is assumed that some private capital
inflows will resume in 2011 to finance a number of stalled tourism projects, although the
adjustment scenario presumes significantly larger inflow.
Baseline scenario
The baseline scenario reflects a continuation of current fiscal policies. The nonfinancial
public sector (NFPS) deficit would decline marginally from 7⅓ percent of GDP in
FY 2009/10 to 7 percent of GDP in FY 2010/11. The NFPS deficit would improve as the
country emerges from the recession, but it would remain at around 3 percent over the
medium term, despite continued sizeable surpluses of the National Insurance Scheme of
about 3 percent of GDP. Accordingly, gross public sector debt would continue to rise from
about 110 percent of GDP at end-FY 2009/10 to about 121 percent of GDP by the end of
FY 2015/16. On the external side, the current account deficit would widen to about
7–8 percent of GDP during 2011–12, and only gradually fall thereafter. Capital will continue
to flow into the country at a weaker pace than in the past, and it will be insufficient to cover
the current account deficit. As a result, gross international reserves would drop from about
4.2 months of imports at end-2010 to
4
2.2 months of imports at end-2015.

undertaken starting in FY 2011/12, and would comprise revenue and expenditure actions, as
well as measures to increase efficiency in, and ensure financial viability of, public
enterprises.
While some of these actions will take some time to show their full results, others would
take effect immediately and deliver early fiscal savings. Accordingly, the NFPS deficit
would narrow by an additional 2¼ percent of GDP in FY 2011/12 to 2¾ percent of GDP.
Over the medium term, the NFPS balance would swing from a deficit of 7⅓ percent of GDP
in FY 2009/10 to a surplus of 2 percent of GDP in FY 2015/16. Compared with the baseline
scenario, this would constitute a cumulative improvement of nearly 19 percent of GDP over
five years. The medium-term adjustment scenario includes a moderate increase in capital
spending, as well as better targeting of social safety payments, as these are considered critical
to raising and sustaining growth.
The scale of corrective fiscal measures and their early implementation would help to
break the unfavorable debt dynamics. Accordingly, gross public sector debt, after peaking
in FY 2010/11 at 114 percent of GDP,

including investment activity in the
tourism and offshore financial sectors—would boost the subsequent economic rebound. In
turn, the higher growth in the outer years combined with lower interest rate spreads on
government borrowing would contribute to improved debt dynamics.
The fiscal consolidation effort will also improve the balance of payments outlook. As
domestic demand is tightened vis-à-vis the baseline scenario, the rate of import growth will
moderate, thus improving the current account balance. In addition, as investor confidence
strengthens, current and capital inflows in general, and FDI in particular, would rebound
more strongly. International reserves, while easing somewhat through 2013, would recover to
about 4¾ months of imports by the end of the projection period.

B. Assessment of DSAs
Baseline scenario
Bound tests show that standard shocks can adversely and significantly affect the path of
public debt. As discussed above, under the baseline scenario, public debt is expected to rise
over the projection period to 121 percent of GDP. Debt ratios are particularly sensitive to
growth and fiscal shocks. Should economic growth decline on a permanent basis by
½ standard deviation from its historic trend, public debt at the end of the projection period
would rise to 140 percent of GDP. Similarly, if the primary balance were to follow historic
trends, public debt would reach 144 percent of GDP at the end of the projection period.
External debt is less sensitive to standard shocks. This is mainly because of the
comparatively low share of external debt relative to total debt (less than one-third). Total
private and public external debt is estimated at about 42 percent of GDP at end-2009, and
after peaking in 2010, is likely to fall under the baseline scenario to about 36 percent of GDP
by the end of the projection period. However, as can be expected, external debt is most
sensitive to a real depreciation shock. Accordingly, an illustrative depreciation of 30 percent

30
would raise the external debt to 53 percent of GDP by the end of the projection period.
Another sensitivity test would be to estimate the potential shock arising from an increase in
the price of oil by 30 percent above current WEO projections during in 2011–15. This would
widen the current account deficit by about 2 percent of GDP, and could lead, everything else
left unchanged, to an effective depletion of reserves by 2015.
Adjustment scenario
Under the active scenario, the public debt outlook would not only improve considerably
but would also be more resilient to shocks. Rather than rising ceaselessly, public debt
would peak in FY 2011/12 and then turn downward, thanks to positive and sustained fiscal
balances, higher overall growth, and lower interest rates and payments. While the fiscal
accounts remain vulnerable to shocks, bound tests reveal that public debt-to-GDP ratios
would generally continue to decline even if some of these shocks impact the economy. A
similar improvement, albeit less pronounced, is also evident in stress tests to the external debt
outlook.

1/ Shaded areas represent actual data. Individual shocks are permanent one-half standard deviation shocks. Figures
in the boxes represent average projections for the respective variables in the baseline and scenario being presented.
Ten-year historical average for the variable is also shown.
2/ Permanent 1/4 standard deviation shocks applied to real interest rate, growth rate, and primary balance.
3/ One-time real depreciation of 30 percent and 10 percent of GDP shock to contingent liabilities occur in 2010, with
real depreciation defined as nominal depreciation (measured by percentage fall in dollar value of local currency)
minus domestic inflation (based on GDP deflator).

1/ Derived as [r - g - (1+g) + (1+r)]/(1+g++g) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms, g = real GDP growth rate,
 = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and  = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-(1+g(1+r1+g++g) times previous period debt stock. increases with an appreciating domestic currency (> 0) and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels
of the last projection year.

Appendix II. Status of Implementation of the 2008 FSAP-Update Recommendations

The 2008 Financial System Stability Assessment-Update noted that several of the shortcomings
identified during the 2002 FSAP had been addressed. However, it noted that regulatory reforms were
still needed to increase the flexibility and stability of the financial system, including the following
key reforms:
 Establishing a clear legal framework for the consolidated supervision of banking groups and
enhancing home/host cooperation;
 Updating the regulations on capital adequacy, asset classification, and loan-loss provisioning;
 Ensuring that the mandate and structure of the upcoming Financial Services Commission
were adequate for the effective supervision of the non banking financial sector.
At the time of the 2010 Article IV Consultation with Barbados, the authorities reported progress in
the following areas:
 Amendments are being drafted to strengthen the legal framework for consolidated
supervision, and a MOU was finalized with the Canadian authorities (a critical step given the
importance of Canadian banks in Barbados);
 Amendments are being considered to upgrade asset classification and provisioning, and
capital adequacy regulations will be updated in the future;
 Amendments are also being considered to establish related-party lending and large exposures
limits, including for aggregate large exposure;
 Legislation to establish the Financial Services Commission (FSC) has been approved by the
Attorney General, in preparation for its submission to Parliament.

APPENDIX II. BARBADOS—RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
As of July 31, 2010
1.
Barbados graduated from World Bank financing in 1993, but has continued to borrow on
an exceptional basis. Two regional HIV/AIDS projects were approved in 2001 and 2008. The
second HIV/AIDS Project (US$35 million), which became effective in January 2009, is
supporting the implementation of the 2008–2013 Barbados National HIV/AIDS Strategic Plan,
specifically to promote: (i) adoption of safe behaviors, in particular amongst the most vulnerable
groups; (ii) access to prevention, treatment and social care, in particular for the most vulnerable
groups; (iii) capacity of organizational and institutional structures that govern the NAP; and (iv)
use of quality data for problem identification, strategy definition and measuring results.

In order to provide a strategic focus to guide CDB’s interventions in Barbados, CDB has prepared a
Country Strategy Paper (CSP), outlining its overall intervention strategy for Barbados over the period
2010–13 to achieve the following outcomes: macroeconomic stability; renewed and improved physical
and environmental infrastructure; a more competitive productive sector; and enhanced social
development. The CSP is consistent with the Government’s own development objectives.

APPENDIX V. BARBADOS—STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
While data provision has some shortcomings, it is broadly adequate for surveillance
purposes. Barbados participates in the General Data Dissemination System, with metadata
and the authorities’ plans for improving the statistical base posted on the Fund’s
Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board.
Real Sector
2.
The Barbados Statistical Services compiles national accounts statistics according to
the 1968 SNA manual. A lack of current, reliable source data on nonsugar agriculture,
private construction, and nontourism service activities affects production-based GDP
estimates. To address some of the weaknesses in this area the authorities initiated a census of
economic activity in June 2005. The census covered tourism, financial businesses, and
transport and communications. Expenditure-based GDP estimates are derived from selected
surveys; the household survey yields a reliable estimate of aggregate consumption, but the
external trade and investment surveys suffer from certain weaknesses. Constant price GDP
estimates, compiled by the Central Bank of Barbados (CBB), have an outdated 1974 base
year; the authorities are currently updating the base year to 2000 in order to facilitate
comparison within the Caribbean Community area. The authorities, with the assistance of
CARTAC, recently completed a revision of the national accounts data. They published the
revised GDP series in current prices, which revealed that current GDP had been
underestimated in 2008 by about 10 percent. However, the revised current price GDP data
are not consistent with the constant price GDP data, which rely on 1974 as the base year, and
there are no meaningful GDP deflator data linking both series. These data shortcomings add
some uncertainty to GDP analyses and projections, as presented in the staff report. An early
rebasing of the constant price GDP data should be a high priority.
3.
Despite recent initiatives to update the consumer price index and the index of
industrial production, potential misalignments in real estate prices are not addressed due to
the absence of a systematic index of property prices. The consumer price index uses an
expenditure basket for 1998–99 for its July 2001=100 series introduced in January 2002. The
index of industrial production is based on the sectoral weights from 1982; the authorities are
currently working towards rebasing the series to 1994. Since these outdated base years do not
necessarily reflect the current structure of consumption and production, they possibly distort
the derived price data.
Government finance statistics
4.
Fairly comprehensive and up-to-date above-the-line data are available for the general
government, but government transfers are reported with a lag. As a result of the incomplete
coverage of off-budget transactions, a discrepancy exists between the overall balance and
financing data in some years. Public enterprise data are not systematically and promptly
reported to the Ministry of Finance. Financial sector data on public sector net domestic
borrowing usually cannot be fully reconciled with above-the-line fiscal data, partly because
of limited availability of nonbank financial sector information. This reduces the degree of
certainty about the actual fiscal position. The authorities introduced accrual accounting of
public finance in April 2007.

10
Monetary and financial statistics
5.
While some weaknesses remain with respect to the overall quality, coverage, and
timeliness of the monetary and financial statistics, they do not hinder Fund surveillance. The
2007 and 2008 STA missions found that the quality of monetary and financial statistics was
compromised by various methodological problems, misclassifications, and the inconsistent
application of residency criterion. The technical assistance missions recommended correcting
a number of misclassifications of accounting data and assisted the CBB in compiling the
standardized report forms (SRFs). The CBB has recently started compiling monetary
statistics based on the SRFs, which include comprehensive detailed depository corporations’
data.
External sector statistics
6.
Lags in the compilation of merchandise trade data, and infrequent and incomplete
information on the activities of the offshore sector, limit the timeliness of the external current
account balance estimates. Estimates of the components of the external financial account
need to be improved. The authorities, with assistance from CARTAC, are working on
compiling data on the net international investment position of Barbados.

BARBADOS
Staff Report for the Article IV Consultation—Supplementary Information
Prepared by the Western Hemisphere Department
Approved by David J. Robinson and James Roaf
November 30, 2010
1.
On November 22, Minister Sinckler presented a supplementary budget to
Parliament. He proposed a number of revenue and spending measures with a net fiscal effort
of BDS$149 million (or 1¾ percent of GDP) on an annualized basis. The most important
measures include:


On the revenue side, about BDS$180 million higher revenue on an annualized basis
by (1) raising the VAT rate from 15 percent to 17.5 percent for a period of 18 months
effective December 1, 2010; (2) removing various deductions for travel,
entertainment, and investment from taxable income; (3) raising the gasoline excise
tax and some other fees, while reducing the environmental levy on imported goods;
and (4) raising by one-third public bus fares, which have remained unchanged since
the early 1990s, thus allowing lower government transfers to the transport board.



On the expenditure side, additional net spending of BDS$31 million by increasing
(1) transfers to the Barbados Tourism Authority; (2) pension payments; and
(3) welfare grants and food voucher payments. The authorities also plan to establish a
grant to finance primary school textbooks, while limiting the free enrollment period
in the public university. New programs to shore up the private sector include a tax
credit for businesses that generate additional employment, and a loan-guarantee
facility to support investment in the tourism sector.

The proposed measures would
contribute to the much required fiscal
consolidation, particularly in the early
years. Moreover, some of the additional
spending is targeted at vulnerable
segments of society and at supporting
business investment. However, the fiscal
effort would not be as large as in the
staff’s adjustment scenario, most notably
because the VAT increase would be

reversed in 18 months. Accordingly, while the debt would stabilize at about 114 percent of
GDP in FY 2015/16 under the staff’s economic assumptions, it would remain very elevated.
3.
Overall, the staff believes that the recently announced supplementary budget is
an important first step toward fiscal consolidation, but would stress that additional
measures will be needed to put public debt firmly on a downward path, as envisaged in
the authorities medium-term strategy.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2010 Article IV Consultation with
Barbados
On November 29, 2010, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Barbados. 1
Background
The global economic crisis has hit Barbados particularly hard, by adversely impacting all of its
key economic activities, including tourism, financial services, and real estate investment. After
contracting by almost 5 percent in 2009, output is expected to continue its decline in 2010,
albeit at a slower rate. The weak economy has led to a steady increase in the unemployment
rate which reached 10.7 percent in the second quarter of 2010, up from 7.4 percent in 2007.
While average inflation fell in 2009, it has picked up in 2010 and is expected to end the year at
about 5 percent, fueled by higher energy prices, before receding again. Lower government
revenues and higher expenditures are contributing to persistently large fiscal imbalances. Thus,
the nonfinancial public sector deficit is expected to remain at around 7 percent of GDP in Fiscal
Year 2010/11 (April to March), only marginally lower than in the previous two fiscal years. As a
result, public debt continues to grow and could approach 115 percent of GDP by the end of the
current fiscal year.
The external current account deficit narrowed in 2009 to 5.5 percent of Gross Domestic
Product, down from almost 10 percent in the previous year, thanks to a recession-induced
contraction of imports and lower petroleum prices. Lower tourism receipts, the near-stop in
Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:

foreign direct investment inflows in 2009, and a US$100 million bond repayment in mid-2010
put the country’s reserves under severe pressure. However, the Special Drawing Rights
allocations of US$85 million in 2009, in addition to two foreign bond placements in 2009 and
2010, totaling US$220 million, boosted international reserves, which are expected to end 2010
above US$700 million.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that the global crisis severely impacted the Barbados economy,
especially its key sectors—tourism, financial services, and real estate. The economy is
expected to rebound gradually but downside risks persist mainly from the uncertain global
economic environment.
Directors commended the authorities for adopting a Medium-Term Fiscal Strategy aimed at
generating a balanced budget and reducing the high public debt-to-GDP ratio. They welcomed
the recent measures to raise VAT rates and public transportation tariffs, while boosting
spending targeted at vulnerable segments of society. Directors emphasized that to place public
debt on a sustainable path, additional measures will be necessary. They encouraged efforts
aimed at broadening the tax base, making the VAT increase permanent, raising corporate tax
rates, and streamlining government operations, while continuing to rein in current spending.
Prioritizing expenditure would also make room for moderate increases in capital spending to
support medium-term growth.
Directors observed that the peg to the U.S. dollar has provided a valuable anchor to Barbados.
Noting that Barbados’ real exchange rate may have become somewhat overvalued, they called
for decisive fiscal adjustment to safeguard the viability of the peg. Directors viewed the current
monetary policy stance as broadly appropriate. They recommended maintaining spreads
between the minimum deposit rate and policy rates in core economies at levels consistent with
prevailing market conditions.
Directors noted that banks in Barbados remain healthy. While nonperforming loans have
increased, robust capital bases provide effective cushions against future losses. They
commended the authorities for strengthening bank oversight, including by creating a financial
stability unit in the central bank. Implementing the recommendations of the 2008 FSAP Update
and more detailed data collection on banks’ loan portfolio will further strengthen supervision and
stress-testing exercises.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ efforts to improve the supervision of nonbank financial
institutions, an area of weakness highlighted by the recent demise of two insurance companies.
They called for timely action to consolidate nonbank financial supervision into the Financial
Services Commission and underscored the need to resolve the problematic insurance
companies to lift market uncertainty and provide clarity on contingent fiscal costs.
Directors acknowledged the relatively good business environment in Barbados. However, in
light of the country’s weak productivity growth, they saw merit in further streamlining
government agencies and procedures, and looking for ways to broaden growth sources.
