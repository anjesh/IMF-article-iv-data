STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
AND REQUEST FOR AN EXTENDED CREDIT FACILITY
ARRANGEMENT

KEY ISSUES
Background. Grenada is in the midst of a deep fiscal crisis. Public debt reached about
110 percent of GDP at end-2013, in part reflecting attempts to run countercyclical fiscal
policies since the outset of the global crisis. The government that took office in March 2013
found that it was unable to meet its financial obligations and immediately announced that it
would seek a “comprehensive and collaborative” debt restructuring. The economy is
meanwhile recovering slowly after a long period of negative growth.
Article IV Discussions. The discussions focused on the main challenges facing the
economy: the fiscal crisis and the debt overhang, weak competiveness and a weakened
financial system. These challenges must be fundamentally addressed to unlock sustainable
high quality growth in Grenada.
The Proposed Program. To address these challenges, the authorities have designed a
comprehensive adjustment program focused on:



Strengthening competiveness to improve medium-term growth prospects by tightening
income policies, removing constraints to growth through reforms in the energy and
other sectors, improving the investment environment, and putting in place the legal
infrastructure for public private partnerships.



Restoring fiscal sustainability through a comprehensive three pillar approach consisting
of: (i) a significant and frontloaded fiscal adjustment to address flow imbalances, (ii) a
comprehensive debt restructuring to address stock imbalances, and (iii) ambitious fiscal
structural reforms to support fiscal sustainability.



Strengthening the financial sector. Grenada is participating in the ongoing regional
strategy to strengthen financial regulation and supervision in the ECCU and will
undertake additional reforms to further strengthen financial institutions in Grenada.

Request for an Extended Credit Facility Arrangement. In support of their comprehensive
adjustment program, the authorities have requested a three year Extended Credit Facility
(ECF) in the amount of SDR14.04 million (120 percent of quota, about US$21.9 million).
SDR2.04 million will be available upon Board approval of the ECF and the remainder in six
subsequent installments of SDR 2 million upon successful completion of semiannual
reviews.

BACKGROUND
1.
A decade of natural disasters and economic shocks coalesced into a deep economic
crisis by 2011-12. In 2004, Grenada was hit by one of the strongest hurricanes ever recorded in
the North American Basin, which was followed by a protracted and costly recovery (Figure 1).1
Before the economy was able to fully recover from the hurricane, Grenada was severely affected
by the global financial crisis. Economic activity declined by over 8 percent of GDP from peak to
trough (2008-12) as tourism and construction collapsed. This compares to a 1⅓ percent decline
in emerging markets and a 5⅓ percent decline in the tourism-based Caribbean over the same
period. As a member of the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union (ECCU), a regional quasi-currencyboard arrangement with a common currency pegged to the U.S. dollar, Grenada lacks an
independent monetary policy, and therefore resorted to fiscal policy to try to counteract the
effects of the global financial crisis.2 However, the impact of the fiscal expansion on growth was
constrained by Grenada’s long-standing competitiveness challenges and small fiscal multipliers
due to the openness of the economy. As a result, fiscal imbalances widened without a
commensurate increase in growth.

2.
Two consecutive Fund arrangements during 2006–13 supported the authorities’
efforts to maintain macroeconomic stability following these shocks, while also addressing
Grenada’s underlying fiscal and macroeconomic imbalances.3 The first arrangement during
1

Hurricane Ivan (September 2004) caused catastrophic damage in Grenada (at about 150 percent of GDP). The
remainder of the ECCU and the wider Caribbean were much less affected. In terms of damages and affected
population, this was the largest storm in the Caribbean region in the last decade. Another hurricane, Emily, struck
the island in 2005.
2

The ECCU includes six independent countries (Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, Grenada, St. Kitts and Nevis,
St. Lucia, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines) and two dependent territories of the United Kingdom (Anguilla and
Montserrat). The EC dollar has been pegged at EC$2.7 to US$1 since 1976.

3

The first arrangement during 2006-10 was under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (now Extended
Credit Facility (ECF)), originally approved for US$15.2 million (SDR 10.53 million), and later augmented twice to
help mitigate the impact of commodity price shocks and the global downturn to US$24.9 million (SDR 16.4

2006–10 was successfully completed after several revisions to deal with unanticipated shocks
related to hurricanes, commodity price increases, and the global crisis. The second arrangement
went off-track soon after its first review in November 2010, as the authorities considered
initiating a debt restructuring and as approaching elections and a faltering economy led to
notable policy loosening. The second arrangement expired in April 2013.

By 2011–12, with the Fund-supported program off-track, Grenada faced a perfect
storm of low growth, large fiscal and current account deficits, high debt, and increasing
financing pressures.
 Widening fiscal imbalances. Following the hiatus in the IMF-supported program, the fiscal
situation deteriorated rapidly with a sharp cutback in grants, a fiscal stimulus that involved
tax breaks for the manufacturing sector and temporary employment schemes, and an overall
weakening of revenues. 4 The overall central government deficit widened to 5½ percent of
GDP by 2012, and public debt increased to 103 percent by end-2012.5
 Growing financing constraints. The government’s cash flows came under severe pressure as
the deteriorating fiscal position dried up multilateral financing and domestic banks limited
their exposure to the government. During 2011–12, most of the financing needs were met
through nonmarket placement of government paper with the national insurance scheme and
PetroCaribe, borrowing from the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB), sale of assets, and
accumulation of arrears.

million (SDR 8.8 million, or 75 percent of quota). See also the Ex-Post Assessment of Longer-Term Program
Engagement for Grenada (Press Release No. 14/29).

 External imbalances. Weak domestic demand narrowed the current account deficit to
19.2 percent of GDP in 2012, from an average of about 25 percent of GDP over the previous
five years. With the drying up of FDI inflows, the large current account deficits had been
increasingly financed by debt inflows, especially as banks accumulated foreign liabilities
through inflows of nonresident deposits and borrowing by foreign banks from their
headquarters.6 This increased Grenada’s external debt to 144½ percent of GDP in 2012, up
by about 40 percent of GDP since 2007, and kept reserves broadly stable at about 3 months
of imports.
4.
Most recent Article IV consultations. The most recent Article IV consultation was
concluded in July 2012, with Directors emphasizing the need for a vigorous domestic policy
response to improve weakening competitiveness and foster private-sector-led growth, while
undertaking the needed consolidation to ensure fiscal sustainability. Directors acknowledged the
challenge of achieving lasting fiscal consolidation while protecting the fragile recovery, and
stressed the need to protect social spending and public investment, while focusing the
adjustment efforts on widening the revenue base and streamlining current spending. Since the
last Article IV consultation, the authorities continued efforts to strengthen public finances,
including through improvements at customs and tax administration, but more meaningful
reforms were hindered by the difficult political and economic landscape. Under the proposed
new program, however, the authorities aim to address the recommendations from the last Article
IV consultations (discussed below).

6

ECCU regulations maintain a floor on saving deposit interest rates of 3 percent. The floor has increasingly
widened interest rate differentials with deposit rates offered outside the ECCU region. This has led to a gradual
inflow of nonresident deposits into the banking system, which reached 20 percent of GDP by March 2014, up
about 2 percentage points of GDP since the onset of the global crisis.

employer on the island.7 Except for the small, but
rapidly growing fishing sector, growth in other
sectors remains anemic. Tourism arrivals are
suppressed relative to Grenada’s Caribbean peers,
in part because of a heavier reliance on arrivals
from the UK, which were affected by an increase in
the UK’s air passenger duty (Figure 2).8 Staff
estimates that output was at about 3 percent
below potential in 2013. Unemployment was
recorded at 33.5 percent in the same year, with
youth unemployment as high as 55.6 percent.

6.
The external position worsened considerably in 2013 due to a one-time surge in
FDI-related imports and weak tourism receipts. In 2013, the current account deficit is
estimated to have widened to 27.1 percent of GDP from 19.2 percent in 2012 (Figure 3 and
Table 6). The deterioration was primarily driven by a sharp increase in imports related to the
resort construction project, estimated at about 6½ percent of GDP. Tourism receipts remained
weak, but exports of goods improved slightly on the back of the continued recovery in nutmeg
production after the 2004-05 hurricanes and the strong performance in the fishing industry.9 In
the financial account, while the resort construction project boosted FDI inflows in 2013, but the
large current account deficit continued to be financed by debt-related inflows and accumulation
of external arrears in the public sector. The overall balance of payments was in a surplus of
2 percent of GDP in 2013, pushing up reserves to 3½ months of imports from about 2½ months
of imports in 2012.
7.
Economic slack and tight monetary conditions brought the economy into
deflationary territory. On average, consumer prices declined marginally in 2013, held down by
declines in telecommunications and clothing prices in the first six months of the year (Table 7).
In the last four months of the year, prices fell for goods that account for about a quarter of the
CPI basket. The downward drift in inflation reflects in part weak demand and tight credit
conditions: the central bank’s discount rate has not changed over the past nine years and lending
rates have declined only marginally despite ample liquidity in the banking system, held up by
high delinquencies in existing portfolios and by the 3 percent interest floor on saving deposits.
7

The new Sandals Resort International project has undertaken works estimated at US$80 million (10 percent of
GDP) during 2013, reviving Grenada’s construction sector after a seven-year slump.
8

An excise duty charged on passengers flying from the U.K. The U.K. government has recently announced
reforms of the air passenger duty that will come into effect in 2015, which will reduce rates for “long-haul” flights,
including the ones to most of the Caribbean destinations.
9

It takes 7-10 years for nutmeg trees to reach the harvest level and 13 years to reach peak production. Most
trees were wiped out in the 2004 hurricane and, as a result, production remains at about 15 percent of prehurricane levels.

Constraints on both the demand and supply side of the credit market led to a 5 percent decline
in private credit in 2013, which continued in early 2014 (Figure 4). The real effective exchange
rate has depreciated slightly since mid-2013, reflecting low inflation and the depreciation of the
U.S. dollar against major currencies.

Financial sector balance sheets have been increasingly strained. Impaired assets
continued to increase with weak economic activity and are estimated at 13.8 percent of total
bank loans in December 2013 under existing loan classifications; however, the level of
impairments may be significantly higher under stricter international norms (Table 8). The related
increase in provisioning and decline in profitability weakened capital adequacy to a reported
13.6 percent of risk-weighted assets in December 2013, but capital adequacy would be lower
under stricter loan classification and provisioning rules. The erosion of capital over the past few
years also reflects provisioning against financial institutions’ exposures to the failed regional
insurance company, the CL Financial Group, which was fully written off by end-2012 by banks,

Subdued activity also weakened the 2013 fiscal position, despite efforts to rein in
current spending. Tax revenues weakened across the board reflecting sluggish activity outside
growth sectors and, to a lesser extent, fiscal stimulus to the manufacturing sector since 2010.11,12
Overall revenues held up, however, due to the receipt of a one-off licensing fee. On the spending
side, the need to make large retroactive wage settlements agreed by the previous government
for the period 2009-12 put pressures on government spending.13 By mid-2013, to alleviate the
mounting pressures on the fiscal accounts, the government stepped up tax administration efforts

Grenada’s exposure to the CL Group ― which includes British American Insurance Company (BAICO) and the
Colonial Life Insurance Company (CLICO) ― was estimated at 3.9 percent of GDP. Of this, banks’ had investments
of 0.7 percent of GDP, credit unions of 1.3 percent, insurance companies of 0.05 percent and individuals of
1.2 percent. The resolution of BAICO’s ECCU operations is almost complete, with the sale of its traditional
insurance portfolio to a large regional insurance company completed in March 2013, and planned full repayment
of its deposit-like liabilities underway – both with financial assistance from the government of Trinidad and
Tobago. However, progress on the resolution of CLICO remains slow.
11

Important growth drivers in 2013 (construction, education and fishing) have not contributed to an
improvement in tax revenues due to significant tax exemptions received by these sectors.
12

The main pillars of the stimulus (the manufacturer’s rebate program) included a halving of VAT rates on
selected construction materials and a reduction in non-VAT tax liabilities equivalent to 10 percent of
manufacturers’ gross annual sales. The revenue loss to date was limited (0.3 percent of GDP) due to the low
non-VAT tax liabilities, but the manufacturers have accumulated unused “rebate” balances of about 1.3
percent of GDP.
13

The triennial wage negotiations between the government and the unions for 2009–12 were completed by the
previous government in December 2012. The agreement involved a 6 percent wage increase (4 percent for 2009
and another 2 percent for 2012) and some one-off payments, which will translate into a 0.5 percent of GDP
permanent increase in wages and a 1.7 percent of GDP retroactive (one-off) payment. Half of the retroactive cost
was settled in 2013 (0.8 percent of GDP), with the remaining half to be settled in 2014.

and took action to contain spending on goods and services. It succeeded in containing the
primary deficit to 3⅔ percent of GDP, within the budgeted targets although still significantly
wider than the previous year. A step up in the coupon on the 2025 bond (issued in the 2005
restructuring) and the high cost of the bank overdraft to which the government had to resort,
have pushed the interest bill to 3½ percent of GDP, with the overall 2013 deficit widening to
7 percent of GDP (on an accrual basis) from 5½ percent in 2012.
10.
The weak fiscal position has continued to stoke financing pressures. Overall public
debt increased to about 110 percent of GDP by end-2013, among the highest debt ratios in the
world. Gross financing needs totaled 33.8 percent of GDP in 2013, which the government was
unable to meet in full (Figure 5):


Unable to secure financing for an upcoming coupon payment, the newly elected government
announced on March 8, 2013 that it would undertake a “comprehensive and collaborative”
restructuring of its public debt. The restructuring is to exclude treasury bills issued in the
Regional Government Securities Market (RGSM) to avoid contagion to other ECCU
sovereigns that tap that market, as well as debt to multilateral institutions. Together, these

POLICY DISCUSSIONS AND THE PROPOSED
PROGRAM
11.
The authorities and staff agree on the importance of restoring fiscal sustainability,
while creating supportive conditions for high-quality growth. The authorities have
developed a comprehensive policy agenda that seeks to: (i) enhance competitiveness to promote
private sector growth and employment, through the implementation of structural reform; (ii)
resolve the fiscal crisis through fiscal adjustment and debt restructuring, while protecting social
safety nets; and (iii) strengthen financial sector stability by enhancing regulation and supervision.

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

GRENADA

12.
The authorities’ policy framework draws on the lessons learned from the recent expost assessment (EPA) of Fund engagement with Grenada.14 The EPA found that performance
under the two latest Fund-supported programs was affected by the difficulties of tackling major
natural and economic shocks, while facing institutional challenges characteristic of small
countries. The main lessons pointed to overoptimistic growth projections, a large number of
structural reform measures that exceeded Grenada’s capacity constraints, and weak program
ownership. The EPA concluded that new Fund engagement would benefit from (i) a clear
ownership and track record demonstrated through prior actions and indicative targets; (ii) a
focus on only few macro-critical reforms, with greater emphasis on growth with assistance by the
World Bank and Caribbean Development Bank; (iii) a significant fiscal adjustment, with reductions
in the wage bill and efforts to scale back tax incentives; (iv) policy buffers and built-in flexibility to
deal with likely shocks, as well as (v) realistic growth projections.

A. Outlook, Risks and the Macroeconomic Framework
The recovery is expected to be modest in the near term and inflation to remain subdued. Downside
risks dominate for now and stem from the uncertain impact of the fiscal consolidation on growth,
faltering confidence, and a continued weak global recovery.
13.
The pace of economic recovery is expected to be modest over the program period.
Staff projects growth to average 1½ percent during 2014-17, supported by a broadening of the
recovery as the new resort boosts tourist arrivals (Table 1). The recovery is also expected to be
supported by an easing of government financing constraints as the fiscal crisis is gradually
resolved with the implementation of a comprehensive fiscal adjustment and the completion of
the debt restructuring. Nevertheless, a faster recovery is expected to be held back by the drag of
the fiscal adjustment and the weak credit growth as banks repair their balance sheets. The
unemployment rate is expected to remain high over the medium-term, reflecting a significant
structural component. Over the longer-term, growth is projected to recover steadily to about
2½ percent as domestic and external conditions normalize.
14.
Inflation is projected to remain subdued in the face of weak demand and moderate
commodity inflation. Staff projects that inflation would average 1½ to 2 percent a year over the
program period as spare capacity persists and the external price pressures remain modest. Over
the medium-term, inflation is projected to remain around 2 percent, in line with imported
inflation.
15.
The external current account deficit is expected to improve gradually with the fiscal
consolidation and a recovery in exports. Exports are projected to rebound steadily, as nutmeg
production recovers from hurricane-related damage and as global tourism demand improves. A

compression of public sector imports due to the envisaged fiscal consolidation is expected to
more than offset a projected pickup in private sector imports as the economy recovers. As a
result, the current account deficit is projected to narrow during the program period, from
27.1 percent in 2013 to about 18.9 percent of GDP by 2017. Nevertheless, without a significant
pickup in private capital inflows, and in the absence of debt restructuring, external financing
requirements are expected to remain high, with an external financing gap estimated to average
of US$58.3 million (6¾ percent of GDP) per year during 2014–17.

Downside risks to the macroeconomic outlook are high for the time being (Annex
I). The economy may be slower to recover or the drag of the fiscal adjustment may have a higher
impact than projected by staff. The main risks to the outlook stem from faltering confidence if
progress is not made soon in addressing the fiscal crisis, from a continued weak global recovery
(on which Grenada depends for tourism) and from potential natural disasters. The impact of
potential spillovers from the international financial markets (including changes in the U.S.
monetary policy) is likely to be low, given the relative insulation from traditional capital flows,

The authorities agree with staff’s views on the macroeconomic outlook and share
staff’s concerns regarding downside risks to growth. While committed to undertaking the
necessary consolidation to restore fiscal sustainability, the authorities are particularly concerned

that the sizeable fiscal consolidation may thwart the fragile recovery. Therefore, the authorities
stressed the importance of unlocking concrete gains in Grenada’s competitiveness and growth
through structural reform to attract more private investment and grants.

B. Improving Competitiveness and Setting the Stage for Higher
Sustainable Growth
The program aims to strengthen competitiveness and improve medium-term growth prospects by
tightening income policies, removing constraints to growth through reforms in the energy and
other sectors, improving the investment environment, and putting in place the legal infrastructure
for public private partnerships (PPPs).

Stronger and more sustainable growth is needed to address the economy’s pressing
social challenges. At 2¼ percent a year over the

particular:


Costs are high throughout the economy, reflecting both scale disadvantages and policyinduced costs: (i) electricity tariffs are among the highest in the world, reflecting the small
scale of production and the monopoly position of the electricity provider, including in the
market for renewable electricity generation;15 (ii) institutional and labor arrangements in the
public sector have made it difficult to pursue predictable and macro-consistent incomes
policies and contributed to high port charges, resulting in import costs that are among the
highest in the region; (iii) financing costs are high―with real lending rates at about 9 percent
in 2013; and (iv) staff estimates suggest that the real effective exchange rate could be
overvalued by more than 30 percent (Annex III).

15

The electricity provider (GRENLEC) has monopoly over electricity generation, transmission and distribution until
2073. In addition to some deficiencies in the tariff-setting mechanism, the monopoly over electricity generation
has thwarted entrance into the renewable electricity market.

Structural impediments have also contributed to weak competitiveness. Impediments to
higher growth and investment include closed distribution markets in Grenada’s main
agricultural products (cocoa and nutmeg), red tape throughout the investment process, and
inefficient public services. Natural disasters have further exacerbated the challenges. Further,
enterprise surveys conducted by the World Bank show companies are particularly concerned
about the unskilled workforce, ineffective tax administration, and to a lesser extent, trade
regulations as impediments to doing business.

Policy space to adjust to external shocks and to provide support to growth has also been
limited, if not exhausted. As part of the currency union, Grenada cannot use the nominal
exchange rate as an adjustment tool, and its fiscal space has been exhausted.

19.
In light of Grenada’s competitiveness challenges, a key objective of the authorities’
program is to create a propitious environment for the private sector to take over as the
main growth driver.

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

GRENADA



The fiscal consolidation and tight income policies in the public sector (see below) should
help boost the country’s competitiveness and external sustainability. Given the strong
linkages between public and private sector wages, restraint in public wages is expected to
be transmitted to private wages and contribute to a lowering of unit labor costs.16



As part of the strategy to promote internal devaluation, the authorities will pursue other
avenues to improve cost efficiency including, most importantly, a reduction in energy costs.
Complementing wage moderation, the government will focus its efforts on policies aimed
to reduce markups through liberalization of some sectors and improving the investment
environment to attract new capital inflows (MEFP ¶9). In particular, it will liberalize key
sectors in the economy (renewable energy, nutmeg and cocoa trade) and aim at lowering
electricity costs by operationalizing, with assistance from the World Bank, an independent
regulatory authority for a more efficient pricing of electricity (MEFP ¶12-13). The authorities
also aim to improve the business environment to address bottlenecks in the investment
process, transform the Industrial Development Corporation into a functioning one-stop
shop for investors, and codify all the tax incentives that could benefit investments. The
government will also explore PPPs, first by putting in place a comprehensive framework to
safeguard against associated risks (MEFP ¶10). The government will review the labor
agreements with the port authority and, more generally, will revise the Labor Code to
introduce a shift system to help reduce costs and increase efficiency (MEFP ¶14).



To ensure broad ownership of reforms to support growth and reach a consensus on
economy-wide wage restraint, the authorities have undertaken national consultations with
trade unions, private businesses and other social partners (MEFP ¶14). As a result of these
consultations, the stakeholders have recently finalized a Social Compact with the
government on a framework for fostering sustainable development, which includes
improved competitiveness and wage moderation.

C. Restoring Fiscal Sustainability
The program envisages a primary fiscal consolidation of 7¾ percent of GDP over three years, with
upfront legislated measures. Together with debt restructuring and fiscal structural reforms, this
should set public debt on a firm downward path to the regional target of 60 percent of GDP.

16

Evidence from available wage data for St. Lucia (which is often used as a proxy for the ECCU region) points to
public wage growth leading private wage growth.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

GRENADA

Fiscal Consolidation
20.
The authorities and staff agreed that significant fiscal consolidation is needed to
address Grenada’s fiscal imbalances. In the absence of debt restructuring and consolidation
measures, the overall deficit would remain in the range of 8–9 percent of GDP as debt servicing
costs would continue to rise. As a result, public debt would increase from about 110 percent of
GDP at end-2013 to over 134 percent of GDP by 2020, more than twice the regional target. The
authorities’ program targets a sizeable fiscal consolidation of 7¾ percentage points of GDP,
aimed at reaching a primary surplus of 3½ percent of GDP by 2016 (Box 1; MEFP ¶17). This
consolidation effort would put debt on a

The authorities envisage substantially front-loaded measures to turn around the
fiscal position, but the impact on growth is expected to be moderate. Three quarters of the
fiscal consolidation effort will be undertaken in the first two years of the proposed program, with
most revenue measures needed for the entire adjustment already approved (Tables 2a and 2b;
MEFP ¶18-19). The adjustment will focus on curtailing current spending and widening the tax
base. To minimize the impact of the fiscal adjustment on growth, staff and the authorities agreed
that the fiscal consolidation should protect social spending and growth-enhancing capital
investments and this has been reflected in the design of the authorities’ proposed program:


Half of the adjustment effort will focus on boosting the revenue base, since―with a tax
revenue-to-GDP ratio of less than 20 percent―Grenada’s tax intake is low compared to the
both the region and many countries at similar income levels. An essential revenue measure is
the reduction in the minimum threshold for paying the personal income tax, which—at three
times per capita income—was the highest in the region. The authorities have nearly halved
the threshold as of January 1, 2014, increasing the coverage of income tax from 5 percent of
income earners to an estimated 19 percent.17 Other revenue measures include: increases in
property tax rates and a revaluation of assessed property values; an increase in the custom

17

The personal income tax threshold was lowered from EC$60,000 to EC$36,000 as of January 2014. The marginal
tax rate will be 0 percent up to EC$36,000, 15 percent between EC$36,000 and EC$60,000, and 30 percent above
this threshold.

services charge; a broadening of the base of
income, VAT and other taxes through a
reduction in exemptions; and the
introduction of new taxes, such as a financial
activities tax and a small business tax. The
tax incentive regime will also be reformed as
part of the structural reform agenda to
ensure the integrity of the tax base going
forward.

spending will contribute more than a quarter
of the total fiscal savings. With about two thirds of revenues financing the cost of the civil
service (wages and pensions), the authorities’ expenditure measures going forward will focus
on tackling the large wage bill. The program envisages a freeze of the nominal wage bill at
current levels and its further reduction to historical levels through attrition, elimination of
vacancies, and structural reforms of civil service employment and pay. The government has
already reached agreement with the trade unions to defer all wage negotiations for the
duration of the program to avoid disruptive retroactive payments in 2015-16, and will cap
the growth of the wage bill from 2015 to a level that can be sustained by tax inflows in the
forthcoming fiscal responsibility legislation. Other expenditure measures include: a reduction
in spending on goods and services through savings in the utilities bill, rental and
communication costs, as well as a nominal freeze in most other categories of current
spending. While restraint in capital spending appears to contribute significantly to the
adjustment effort (about a quarter), it does so only when compared to the 2013 level, when
non-grant-financed capital spending was high by historical standards due to an increase in
spending on social programs.18

22.
Tax administration reforms will be critical in supporting the fiscal adjustment
effort. The authorities will focus on implementing the reform agenda already put together with
extensive support from the regional technical assistance center CARTAC over the past several
years. This agenda includes increased focus on risk management and large taxpayers; improving
incentives for tax collections by appropriately designing the compensation structure for tax
collectors; connecting the customs and inland revenue information systems and ensuring
exchange of information between the two departments; enactment of the newly drafted Customs
Bill that will modernize the existing legislation and introduce penalties for noncompliance,
among other things; and the creation of an internal audit unit at customs (MEFP ¶18 & ¶25).

18

Many social projects are classified under capital spending, a statistical issue that will need to be addressed in
future reform efforts.

Box 1. Fiscal Adjustment Effort and the Fiscal Impulse
In the case of Grenada’s program, the fiscal measures are more frontloaded and larger than suggested by
the headline fiscal numbers. The headline primary balance is programmed to improve by
7.2 percentage points of GDP between 2013 and 2016, but the underlying adjustment effort amounts to
7¾ percent of GDP. Also, the headline numbers

suggest the adjustment is focused on the last two

23.
The authorities and staff agreed on the need to accommodate increased social
spending for the most vulnerable groups during the period of fiscal adjustment. With
assistance from the World Bank, the authorities are strengthening their flagship social assistance
program SEED (Support for Education, Employment, Empowerment and Development) ―an
amalgamation of several smaller programs that now accounts for 18 percent of total social
spending―through the establishment of a beneficiary registry and the introduction of proxy
means testing as the eligibility criterion. During the program period, cash transfers under the
SEED program will be increased by an estimated 0.3 percent of GDP, a floor on spending under
the program will ensure the adjustment is not achieved by a retrenchment in targeted transfers,
and further assistance to support social safety nets will be sought from the donor community
(MEFP ¶15). To further rationalize social programs going forward, the government has approved
at end-March 2014 a Social Protection Strategy (Box 2). The major objectives of the new social
development strategy are to: (i) strengthen the production and use of household poverty data
for better policy design of social programs; (ii) increase the poverty reduction focus of social
safety net programs though consolidation of social programs; (iii) undertake social and legal
reforms to improve access to services for the poor and vulnerable by rationalizing the social
programs; (iv) help families make the transition from welfare dependence to economic selfsufficiency; (v) ensure an efficient, effective, transparent and accountable social protection service
delivery by using the proxy means test to develop a common targeting mechanism for all major
safety net and social protection interventions, and harmonize the eligibility criteria and

22

application processes. This strategy will serve as a basis for government’s Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper that will be finalized by June 2014 and will ensure that poverty reduction remains
a priority.
Box 2. Social Safety Nets

% of GDP

Social protection spending has increased significantly during the crisis, from 1⅓ percent of GDP in 2009
to 2½ percent of GDP in 2013. There are about 25 social protection programs in Grenada, covering both social
safety nets for the most vulnerable groups and
employment support programs, and largely financed

by donor funds. The three main social programs, which

spending, are SEED (consolidated cash transfer

and De-Bushing (employment program, clearing up of

beneficiary database and uniform eligibility criteria,
and the programs are poorly monitored.
Within this context, the Government has launched a two-pronged approach to strengthening the
delivery of social protection programs. With assistance from the World Bank, in 2010, the Government
designed and created a pilot program to consolidate its three top safety net programs (giving rise to SEED)
and set out to improve its targeting. For this purpose, the government is currently developing a database with
full demographic and economic background of the existing beneficiary households of the SEED program
(about 3,500 households) and is developing criteria for a proxy means test. Once tested, these criteria will be
applied to the existing SEED beneficiary households to determine eligibility, likely before end-2014. At the
same time, the Government has developed―with assistance from UNICEF and UN Women― a coherent social
protection strategy aimed at strengthening the social safety nets more broadly through the consolidation and
rationalization of the social programs, increasing the poverty reduction focus of social safety net, rolling out
the proxy means testing to other social programs to ensure an effective, transparent and accountable social
protection service delivery, and harmonizing the eligibility criteria and application processes across programs.
There is a need to strengthen and rationalize existing programs to ensure that they better address priority
groups.

24.
Risks to the fiscal outlook are significant. The main risks stem from underperformance
in revenues due to weaker-than-expected growth or a lower than expected yield of the new
revenue measures. Risks on the expenditure side stem from potential difficulties in controlling
expenditure commitments of line ministries before the programmed structural reforms come into
effect and from potential disaster-related spending hikes. To deal with these risks, the program
has identified contingency measures on both revenues and expenditures to bring the fiscal flows
on track with program targets (gradual release of spending appropriations and the expansion of
the income tax base), as well as contingency financing. On the latter, the authorities will save the
budgetary receipts from the recently established citizenship-by-investment program (CBI)

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

23

GRENADA

―which could yield revenues, as it currently does in other ECCU countries― for contingency
financing during the program period (Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU) ¶5).19 The
government is also seeking donor assistance to support the program by purchasing additional
natural disaster insurance for the duration of the program to ensure that government policies are
not derailed by natural disaster shocks (MEFP ¶20).

Debt Restructuring and Regularization of Arrears
25.
The authorities and staff agreed that comprehensive debt restructuring is essential
to bring the overall public debt to sustainable levels. While the planned fiscal adjustment
would reverse the upward debt dynamics and put debt on a downward path, public debt would
remain at a high level over the medium-term in the absence of debt restructuring. As shown in
the debt sustainability analysis (Annex II), the risk of debt distress would continue to remain high
as all debt and debt service thresholds would be breached even in the absence of unanticipated
shocks. The comprehensive debt restructuring being pursued by the authorities is critical to
reducing debt to sustainable levels, lowering the risk of debt distress, and putting the ECCU debt
target of 60 percent of GDP by 2020 within reach (Annex II, MEFP ¶22).
26.
With assistance from financial and legal advisors, the authorities have initiated
debt restructuring negotiations to address the debt overhang. The authorities have reached
out to all affected creditors to achieve a comprehensive and collaborative debt restructuring
(MEFP ¶23). Because of the diversity of the affected creditors, the pace of negotiations with
various groups of creditors will differ:


Formal discussions with creditors holding the US$ 2025 bond (30 percent of the eligible
debt) started in March 2014 with consultations on the economic program and the underlying
macroeconomic framework, and have continued through scheduled weekly conference calls.



On April 9, 2014, the government published restructuring scenarios for the holders of
EC$ 2025 bond (11 percent of the eligible debt), which are indicative of the restructuring
terms that the government is seeking in order to bridge its multi-year financing gaps and
achieve meaningful debt reduction. The initial offer from the government included two bond
options that would be issued in exchange for tendered debt: a 60 percent and a 50 percent
principal haircut, maturity extensions, and coupon reductions (Box 3). Some creditors have
already indicated their willingness to accept the 60 percent haircut option. After further
discussions, a formal offer is expected to be launched for these creditors. Negotiations have
also expanded to domestic financial institutions, including the National Insurance Scheme
(NIS

19

The program does not yet include these receipts as a financing item given the uncertainty surrounding their
magnitude.

Box 3. The Published Debt Restructuring Scenarios
In the context of its ongoing consultation with affected creditors, the government offered two
indicative restructuring options to the holders of its EC$ 2025 bond and to the Taiwanese bank ExportImport Bank of the Republic of China. The first option entails a 60 percent principal nominal haircut,
extends maturity to 15 years with equal installments of principal payments, and sets interest at 6.5 percent
throughout. The second option entails 50 percent principal nominal haircut, extends maturity to 20 years with
2 years of grace period followed by increasing installments of principal payments, and sets interest rate at 5
percent throughout (table and figures). Both options, albeit with different terms, imply the creditors would
receive around 33-43 cents on the dollar, for discount rates ranging between 8 and 12 percent, levels at or
above which the bond is currently trading in the secondary market.



The Export-Import Bank of the Republic of China (5.4 percent of eligible debt), whose
litigation in the U.S. courts to recover their outstanding claims on Grenada is still ongoing,
have indicated a willingness in principle to participate in the restructuring.20 The indicative
scenarios presented for the EC$ 2025 bond were also presented to the Export-Import Bank of
the Republic of China, along with a proposal on the treatment of outstanding arrears.



With regard to other bilateral creditors, the government will request financing assurances
from Paris Club creditors (1.7 percent of eligible debt) prior to the IMF Executive Board
meeting and will seek agreement on a date to discuss the treatment of its debt (including
outstanding arrears) following the approval of the proposed ECF arrangement. The

government of Trinidad and Tobago has also been contacted to initiate discussions on debt
restructuring. An agreement was reached with the Kuwait Fund in March 2013 to clear the
outstanding arrears by end-2015. The Kuwait Fund resumed new disbursements in 2013 and
will continue to provide further financing during the program period.
27.
The published debt restructuring scenarios are consistent with achieving debt
sustainability and reducing near-term debt servicing obligations.21 If all debts other than (i)
multilateral debt, (ii) treasury bills issued in the RGSM, and (iii) loan facilities extended by the
ECCB were to receive a haircut on the nominal value of the claims, a haircut of 50-60 percent, as
pursued by the authorities, would put debt on a firm downward path towards the regional target
of 60 percent of GDP by 2020. Given the scope of the restructuring and the diversity of the
creditor base (see Table 4 for the breakdown of debt by creditor), the range of instruments to be
offered will likely comprise combinations of principal haircuts and maturity extensions, all aimed
at yielding equivalent NPV terms. Therefore, the likely outcome of the debt restructuring will be a
combination of scenarios on equivalent NPV terms, resulting in a range of possible outcomes for
reductions in nominal debt. Under any scenarios that fall within the range presented by the
50-60 percent nominal haircut being pursued by the authorities and their NPV-equivalent terms,
the fiscal financing gaps for the near and medium term would be covered (see section “Program
Modalities”).

Structural reforms for fiscal sustainability
Fiscal structural reforms aim to address the root causes of fiscal imbalances and will focus on
overhauling public financial management (PFM) practices and introducing a rule-based fiscal
policy framework.
28.
In the near term, the authorities will focus the fiscal structural reforms on
strengthening their ability to achieve the targeted fiscal outcomes through reforms to
public financial management (MEFP ¶25). With ongoing technical assistance from the IMF, the
authorities will revise the PFM legislation before end-August 2014 to strengthen budgetary
discipline. The new legislation would mandate strict commitment controls, require all spending in
excess of the originally approved budget to be appropriated by parliament ex-ante through a
supplementary budget, establish clear rules for accessing any contingency appropriations or the
contingency fund, limit extra-budgetary funds held outside the Consolidated Fund, and impose
meaningful enforcement mechanisms. The new legislation would also prohibit changes to the tax
system without parliamentary approval, strengthen within-year budget reviews and multiyear
budgeting, and improve the capital budgeting process. In addition, to identify other reform
priorities across the spectrum of PFM functions, the authorities have requested the IMF to carry

21

The existing stock of debt arrears will be regularized as part of the debt restructuring negotiations, while the
supplier arrears will be fully cleared by end 2015, under the agreed schedule (see TMU ¶8-9).

26

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

GRENADA

out a Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) assessment during the coming
twelve to eighteen months.
29.
Subsequently, the fiscal policy framework will be strengthened to better anchor
fiscal policy decision-making (MEFP ¶25). The existing framework does not impose meaningful
constraints on the conduct of fiscal policies and does not provide a fiscal anchor to guide policy
decisions. It also limits government’s control over its income policies, as wage negotiations with
the trade unions are retroactive and not constrained by economic or fiscal considerations (Box 3).
The authorities will introduce fiscal responsibility legislation before end-2014, with technical
assistance from the IMF, to transition to a rule-based framework that would anchor fiscal policies
during the annual budget cycle and would steer them towards the achievement of the regional
debt target. Following the achievement of the desired fiscal balance, the authorities envisage
capping real spending growth at potential GDP growth (2-2½ percent), while allowing revenues
to absorb cyclical fluctuations; this will ensure that the desired fiscal balance is broadly
maintained over the cycle. The legislation would also establish a more systematic approach to
wage setting by capping personnel spending as a share of tax revenues to secure their
sustainability and by requiring forward-looking rather than retroactive wage negotiations.
30.
The need to reduce personnel spending will require broader reforms to rationalize
employment and the wage structure in the public sector (Box 3, MEFP ¶25). In addition to the
planned reduction in public sector employment through attrition, the government will undertake
a strategic review of the public sector structure, employment and wages, to eliminate
inefficiencies and right-size the public sector. The review will cover government functions, human
resource management, as well as civil service size, composition and remuneration structure. The
reforms will be undertaken in the first half of 2015 with grant support from the European Union.
Targeted reviews, focused on functions and employment in selected ministries, are currently
being undertaken with assistance from the World Bank.
31.
The authorities will also tackle the ubiquitous tax incentives, which have weakened
the tax base in many countries throughout the region (MEFP ¶25). In line with the
recommendations of an ongoing regional technical assistance from the IMF’s fiscal affairs
department, the authorities will make the process

review of the existing exemptions in terms of their rationale, cost and benefits.
32.
To minimize risks to the fiscal position, vulnerabilities in a number of other areas
will also be addressed (MEFP ¶25). The statutory bodies are on a weak financial footing, poorly
monitored and controlled, and present an important source of contingent liability for the central
government (Annex V). With technical assistance from CARTAC, the government will undertake a
strategic review of statutory bodies’ functions and rationale, and will develop a plan for their
liquidation, privatization, or retention before end-October 2014. The revised PFM legislation will
strengthen control over the finances of the statutory bodies, especially in cases where central
government financing is required to support them. As the government is considering PPPs to
bridge the infrastructure gaps, it will safeguard against potential risks by introducing a
comprehensive PPP framework before entering into PPP arrangement (technical assistance will
be provided by the World Bank). To strengthen its capacity to monitor the fiscal risks associated
with parastatal entities and PPPs in particular, the government will create a fiscal risk unit to
monitor and manage these risks. Other fiscal structural reforms under the program will focus on
strengthening debt management (with technical assistance from the IMF and the World Bank),
strengthening cash management through a transition to a more comprehensive Treasury Single
Account and more effective cash flow forecasting, and reforming the public pension system to
make it more equitable and streamlined (the latter two with assistance from CARTAC).

Box 4. The Cost of the Civil Service
At about 12 percent of GDP or two thirds of government revenue (excluding one-off costs), the cost of
the civil service in Grenada consumes a significant share of public resources. The compensation of current
civil servants accounts for about half of total government revenue or 10 percent of GDP, somewhat higher than
the 9 percent of GDP on average in small states. Public pensions consume another 10 percent of revenues or
2 percent of GDP. This leaves little room for high-priority public investment, and reduces the ability of the
government to respond to shocks. Significant rigidities in the public wage setting and in public hiring/firing
decisions has made the management of the wage bill, including its reduction, quite difficult:





28

Employment. The procedures for disciplining or firing
public servants are very cumbersome, resulting in de
facto life-long employment. As a result, the overall
government and the individual ministries have little
latitude in managing their human resources. For this
reason, ministries often rely on contractual (unestablished) employees that can be hired outside the
Public Service Commission1 and the public wage scale,
and these kinds of employees now account for about a
quarter of total public employment. Total public sector
employment has increased by about 12 percent over
the past six years, to about 6½ percent of population
(relatively modest by regional standards).

to boycott key institutions in the country, such as customs and ports. The negotiations cover periods of three
years, but are retroactive, and the need to make large retroactive payments soon after the negotiation imparts
significant uncertainty to fiscal policies and creates financing pressures. In addition, the wage negotiations are
not framed by macroeconomic developments or productivity increases in the public sector. Over the past
fifteen years, wage increases averaged 1.9 percent a year in real terms. In the last negotiations―which were
concluded in 2013 and covered the period 2009-12―the previous government agreed to a 6 percent nominal
increase in wages or a 3 percent wage decline in real terms. The cost of this agreement was 2 percent of GDP
in retroactive one-off payments that pushed up the government’s wage and pension bill in 2013 and 2014.

Pensions. The public pension scheme is non-contributory and covers only the civil servants who joined the
public sector before 1983 (those who joined later receive pensions through the national insurance scheme
(NIS). The civil servants covered under the scheme receive both an NIS and a public pension, introducing
inequities among various cohorts of public retirees. Although not required by law, public pensions are
traditionally indexed to wages. A significant rigidity associated with the pension scheme, however, is the
constitutional requirement that anyone who is “required to retire on abolition of his office or for the purpose
of reorganization” is entitled to a full pension, regardless of the time in service.

D. Strengthening Financial Stability
Grenada is participating in the ongoing regional strategy to strengthen financial stability in the
ECCU and will undertake additional reforms to further strengthen Grenadian financial institutions.
33.
The financial sector remains vulnerable, not least to a deterioration in the economic
environment and spillovers from the regional financial system. Weak economic activity could
result in a further deterioration of banks’ asset quality and erode their capital base. With banks in
the region facing notable financial challenges, Grenada is exposed to potential cross-country
contagion risks, including through confidence channels and interconnections between banks in
the ECCU. Thus far these have been contained in light of the confidence in the regional
authorities’ ability to provide full depositor and creditor protection, but a proactive
strengthening of banks’ balance sheets would be important to safeguard financial stability and
avoid materialization of potential contingent liabilities from weaknesses in the financial sector.22
Private sector solutions should be sought to address problem banks and to safeguard fiscal
sustainability. Stronger balance sheets would also help to limit the impact of the debt
restructuring.
34.
The impact of the debt restructuring on the financial sector is expected to be
manageable:


Banks have relatively limited exposure to the central government. Excluding nonrestructurable debt, their exposure accounts for 5⅓ percent of assets (about 7 percent of
GDP as of September 2013). Some banks are also exposed to statutory bodies, however,
and could be affected if the debts of these institutions (some not guaranteed by the central
government) are restructured as well. The authorities have requested the ECCB to
undertake a stress test of the potential impact of the debt restructuring on banks’ income
and capitalization.



In the nonbank financial sector, credit union exposure to the central government is modest,
concentrated in only two of the ten credit unions and largely in non-restructurable shortterm bills. Insurance companies are more exposed, with a tenth of their assets in
government paper, although a fifth of this exposure is holdings of T-bills. The national
pension scheme has the highest exposure to the central government: about one-fourth of
its portfolio (about 9 percent of GDP as of September 2013) is invested in government
paper. Therefore, the debt restructuring would curtail its income stream and accelerate its
loss in reserves (Annex V).

22

This is particularly true in the context of the ECCU’s quasi-currency board arrangement, which limits the central
bank’s ability to provide liquidity support.

1/ The captial adequacy ratio for credit unions is an approximation, where capital was devided by total assets
minus cash deposits.



Spillovers to the regional financial sector from the debt restructuring are expected to be
limited. The regional financial sector’s direct exposure to Grenadian government debt is
primarily concentrated in treasury bills issued in the Regional Government Securities
Market (RGSM), which are being excluded from the debt restructuring for the explicit
purpose of avoiding contagion to other ECCU sovereigns that tap that market.

35.
The authorities are participating in regional efforts to strengthen the banking
system, supported by the Caribbean Development Bank, the World Bank, and the IMF
(MEFP ¶26). The regional strategy consists of three key pillars: (i) banking sector diagnostics to
assess banks’ capital needs and viability; (ii) legal and institutional reforms to strengthen the
banking system and bring the regulatory framework in line with international standards; and (iii)
bank restructuring and recapitalization based on the results of the banking sector diagnostics. As
part of the program, should the regional banking sector diagnostics not be initiated before
September 2014, Grenada will undertake a comprehensive and independent valuation of
Grenadian bank assets. Subsequent to the valuation exercise, the government will reach
understandings with the ECCB, the regional bank supervisor, to strengthen the financial position
of commercial banks in Grenada and address the results of the valuation exercise by
implementing restructuring and recapitalization strategies. The government will seek private
sector solutions to strengthen the financial position of commercial banks in Grenada and will
seek to limit fiscal costs.
36.
In the nonbanking sector, Grenada has been at the forefront of regional efforts to
revamp insurance regulation and supervision, and proactively addressed weaknesses in the
sector (MEFP ¶26). The authorities support regional efforts to integrate nonbank supervisory
authorities−including through the creation of the Eastern Caribbean Financial Services
Regulatory Commission, which will be responsible for regulating insurance companies
throughout the ECCU−and improve the regulatory framework for nonbanks. With respect to

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

31

GRENADA

credit unions, the government continues to promote the consolidation of the credit union sector
as a means of strengthening the financial safety net. Meanwhile, to further strengthen credit
union regulation, the authorities will: (i) develop, together with the ECCB, options for providing
liquidity support to solvent nonbank institutions; (ii) strengthen the requirements for retaining
profits in the context of the new regional regulations; and (iii) require credit unions to increase
capital to assure adequate capitalization over the next three years. They will also complete the
move to a full risk-based supervision model for credit unions before end-2014.
Box 5. Structure of the Financial Sector
Grenada has a mid-sized financial sector compared to its peers in the region, which is dominated by
banks. Financial sector assets amount to 159 percent of GDP (about 193 percent of GDP including the national
pension fund).



Banks. There are five banks in Grenada: (i) the only indigenous bank (Grenada Cooperative Bank) accounts
for about a quarter of total bank assets, and is the second largest bank; (ii) two foreign-owned but locally
incorporated banks ―RBTT Grenada and Republic Bank Grenada― account for another 42 percent of
banking system assets; and (iii) two foreign banks branches, with headquarters in Canada and Barbados
―Scotiabank and FirstCaribbean International Bank (branch of a Barbados subsidiary of the Canadian bank
CIBC)― account for the rest of the assets. The banks are supervised by the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank.
Offshore banks are not permitted in Grenada.



Credit unions. There are 11 credit unions, with assets of about 18 percent of GDP and a relatively high
penetration of 62 percent of the population.1. Credit unions provide mostly mortgage and consumption
loans by mobilizing member deposits and shares. Credit unions have been supervised by Grenada Authority
for the Regulation of Financial Institutions (GARFIN) since March 2007.



Insurance companies. There are 23 insurance companies, with total assets of about 12 percent of GDP.
Insurance companies are also supervised by GARFIN.



National Insurance Scheme. In addition to these financial institutions, an important financial player is the
national insurance scheme (NIS), which provides a defined benefit plan to the entire population. The NIS
holds total assets of around 35 percent of GDP, with a relatively large share of its investment portfolio
allocated to Grenadian government securities. NIS is also regulated by GARFIN.

PROGRAM MODALITIES
A. Access and Conditionality
37.
The authorities have requested a three-year arrangement under the ECF with access
of 120 percent of quota (US$21.9 million, or SDR 14.04 million). The ECF-supported program
is expected to catalyze significant IFI and donor assistance, helping to meet balance of payment
needs and provide space for the country to undertake the needed fiscal and structural
adjustment. Given Grenada’s current credit outstanding with the Fund (152.4 percent of quota as
of March 2014), the proposed arrangement would imply high access, as it is above the norm of
75 percent of quota for a country that already has outstanding concessional credit of 100-200
percent of quota. Nevertheless, staff considers that high access is justified by the strength of the
proposed adjustment program, a protracted current account deficit, and the large financing gap.
A Fund program would also play a catalytic role by unlocking needed financing for Grenada:


Financing needs. Based on the programmed fiscal adjustment, total balance of payments
financing needs ―generated by the fiscal financing gaps― could reach about
US$233.4 million (about 27 percent of GDP) during 2014–17 (Table 6). About 65 percent of
this gap is to be filled by savings from the debt restructuring and regularization of arrears,
and the rest (US$82 million) by exceptional IFI financing. Fund support would account for a
quarter of the IFI support, and would be used for direct budget financing.23 The World Bank
and the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) are preparing new lending arrangements for
Grenada, each for disbursements of US$30 million during the three years of the program. The
European Union will resume its support for Grenada (expected at €12.4 million over the next
five years) once a Fund supported arrangement is in place.



Strong adjustment program. The authorities’ economic program is ambitious and they have
already undertaken numerous bold policy actions upfront, including obtaining legislative
approval of most of the measures required to support the adjustment program.

38.
Given Grenada’s weak track record of past program implementation, program
disbursements will be broadly evenly phased over each review to avoid front-loading. The
first disbursement available upon Board approval of the program will be SDR 2.04 million, with
the remaining disbursements of SDR 2.0 million each contingent on completions of reviews,
including the financing assurances reviews (Table 10). Given the catalytic role of the Fund,
financing support from other donors is expected to become available only after the Fund
arrangement is in place.

23

The quasi-currency board arrangement restricts the central banks’ ability to provide budgetary support.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

33

GRENADA

39.
Program conditionality is focused on monitoring fiscal targets and implementation
of structural reforms. Prior actions included meeting the 2013 budget targets, demonstrating
satisfactory progress in the debt restructuring discussions, obtaining Cabinet approval of the
draft 2014 budget consistent with the program, and securing parliamentary approval of the
relevant adjustment measures needed for the programmed consolidation. The program will be
monitored through compliance with program conditionality in the context of semi-annual
reviews:


Quantitative performance criteria (PCs) include a floor on central government primary
balance, a ceiling on central government primary spending, and a ceiling on the stock of
central government domestic arrears. There are also continuous PCs on the nonaccumulation of external debt arrears and the contracting of non-concessional external debt.



Indicative targets include a ceiling on central government direct and indirect (guaranteed)
borrowing and a floor on social spending.



Memorandum items. The wage bill and the public employment will also be monitored relative
to the agreed targets.



Structural benchmarks focus on supporting the achievement of fiscal targets, improving
public financial management, and removing obstacles to growth.

40.
Staff concludes that the authorities are in compliance with the Fund’s policies,
based on satisfactory progress on the debt restructuring process, and that the program is
fully financed for the next 12 months, with good prospects to fill the financing gap
subsequently. The authorities have initiated collaborative discussions with all creditor groups in
a transparent and equitable manner; discussions with commercial creditors are proceeding
through weekly scheduled conference calls; and the authorities have made initial offers to some
groups of creditors that are consistent with the debt sustainability and financing objectives
underlying the program. Staff believes that it has adequate assurances that a debt restructuring
will be successfully completed that will fundamentally address Grenada’s fiscal imbalances and
restore debt sustainability. As such, staff believes that the proposed program financing is
adequate as required under Fund policies:


A sustainable debt position. Successful implementation of the program will set debt on a
downward path over the medium-term (Table 4). In addition, staff has adequate assurances
that debt restructuring, which assures debt stock sustainability over the medium-term and
the financeability of the programmed fiscal position (and hence capacity to repay) is likely to
be concluded. The authorities aim to make significant headway in the debt restructuring by
end-2014.



Financing assurances. In line with the Fund’s policy on obtaining financing assurances in
programs involving debt restructuring policies, the authorities have engaged with the
creditors and are pursuing a credible debt restructuring that will ensure that the financing
gaps for 2014-15 are closed, with good prospects for adequate financing during the

34

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

GRENADA

remaining arrangement period. For the purposes of the program, staff and the authorities
agreed that satisfactory progress in the negotiations with the creditors would require: (i)
initiating the negotiation phase of the restructuring with private and bilateral official
creditors; (ii) seeking agreement on a debt restructuring consistent with closing the financing
gap under the program and reducing debt to 60 percent of GDP by 2020; (iii) obtaining
financing assurances from the Paris Club; and (iv) developing a credible timetable for
advancing the restructuring discussions with private creditors through mid-2014 (MEFP ¶24)
that provides adequate assurances the restructuring will be successful. As discussed above,
the authorities have already complied with steps (i), (ii) and (iv), and will request financing
assurances from the Paris Club (step (iii)) prior to arrangement’s approval. With regard to the
financing gaps, they are projected at about US$350 million during 2014-17, of which
US$230.5 million is generated by overdue payments accumulated through end-2014 (Tables
3a and 3b). If all eligible debt is restructured through a 50-60 percent nominal principal
haircut as pursued by the authorities, the cash flow savings could range between US$354410 million, sufficient to cover the projected gaps.


Arrears. In compliance with the Fund’s arrears policy for official creditors, the authorities are
taking steps to regularize arrears with official creditors during the program period (Table 5).
With regard to multilateral creditors, arrears are owed only to the OPEC Fund and they have
been recently regularized through an agreement to repay in full by the end of the third
quarter of 2014. On bilateral official debt, the authorities will request financing assurances
from the Paris Club prior to the IMF Board approval of the arrangement, and arrears to the
Paris Club creditors will also be discussed in the context of the debt treatment negotiations
following program approval. Arrears to the Kuwait Fund have been rescheduled and will be
repaid in installments through 2015. Consistent with the Fund’s lending into arrears policy: (i)
prompt Fund support is considered essential for the successful implementation of Grenada’s
adjustment program; and (ii) with respect to arrears to external private creditors―comprising
missed coupon payments on the US$ and EC$ 2025 bonds ― Grenada is making a good
faith efforts to reach a collaborative agreement in the context of the debt restructuring
negotiations.

B. Capacity to Repay the Fund and Risks to the Program
41.
Grenada’s capacity to repay the Fund is adequate (Table 9). Combined with the use
of Fund resources from two previous ECF arrangements, Fund credit outstanding would reach a
maximum of 3.8 percent of GDP and about 24½ percent of net imputed reserves in 2016. Debt
service to the Fund would peak at 0.6 percent of GDP and 1.9 percent of exports of goods and
services during the repayment period. The debt restructuring, along with the envisaged fiscal
adjustment and structural reforms under the program, will help put Grenada’s debt firmly on a
downward trajectory, which should facilitate timely Fund repayment.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

35

GRENADA

42.
Program implementation risks are high, but will be in part mitigated by strong
ownership of the reforms. Risks to the program include:
 Growth may be weaker than projected. The economy may be slower to recover or the drag of
the fiscal adjustment may be higher than projected by staff. This has informed the design of
the fiscal program and the contingency measures to deal with potential deviations from the
programmed growth path.
 Capacity constraints and difficulties in undertaking a large adjustment in a weak economic
environment. These constraints may result in delays in implementing policy reforms, in
weaker-than-anticipated fiscal outcomes, and potentially larger financing gaps. Some of the
implementation risks were mitigated by critical upfront actions taken by the government, a
relatively flat phasing of disbursements, and the strong electoral mandate of the current
government, which controls all seats in parliament. To address capacity constraints, the
authorities intend to hire a number of donor-financed macroeconomic and tax policy
advisors.
 Natural disasters and other external shocks. Grenada is also highly exposed to external risks,
including from natural disasters. Therefore, the proposed program includes contingency
measures and contingency financing that could be used to offset or finance some of the
associated costs.
These risks will be mitigated by strong ownership of the program both on part of the authorities
and their social partners. The social dialogue over the past year has built significant consensus
among the stakeholders for the urgency of fundamental reforms and for the need to share in the
adjustment effort.
43.
Under the Funds safeguards assessment policy, the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank
is subject to a full safeguard assessment under a four year cycle. The most recent assessment
was completed in April 2012, and no major risks were identified. Recommendations were made
to sustain the ECCB's autonomy going forward, and to ensure that member governments
maintain all foreign exchange balances at the ECCB in accordance with safeguards policy
requirements in cases of budget financing. The next assessment will take place in 2015.

STAFF APPRAISAL
44.
Grenada is facing a confluence of formidable challenges. First, the economy is still
weak after a long period of negative growth. While the incipient recovery provides some relief, it
remains dependent on a few sectors and a broader-based recovery may take time to come
about. Unemployment has long settled at high levels. Reflecting economic slack, inflation has
been on a declining trend over the past two years and is now hovering in deflation territory.
Second, the financial strains of a large public debt overhang and deteriorating fiscal flows have
led to a large financing gap for the government over the past couple of years and, subsequently,
to the decision to restructure its debt in March 2013. Third, Grenada’s competitiveness is weak,
both in terms of costs and the overall business environment, which will hamper growth prospects
going forward. Finally, the health of the financial system has been compromised by the frail
economy and weak credit risk management practices, making it difficult for the financial sector
to support a sustainable recovery. These challenges must be fundamentally addressed to unlock
sustainable high quality growth in Grenada.
45.
The economic program put together by the authorities is appropriately ambitious
to steer the economy through these challenges. The program focuses on strengthening the
economy’s competitiveness and growth prospects through structural reforms. It also focuses on
addressing the fiscal imbalances through a large fiscal adjustment and debt restructuring, as well
as on tackling the problems that led to these fiscal imbalances at their root through public
financial management and fiscal responsibility reforms. In the near term, therefore, the program
will face the difficult challenge of undertaking a strong fiscal adjustment at a time when the
economy is still weak and―in the context of the exchange rate peg―when monetary policy’s
ability to provide support to growth is limited.
46.
The government recognizes the need for a permanent fiscal correction that would
reverse decades of unsustainable policies. The fiscal targets under the program are ambitious
and commensurate with the need for deep reductions in the public debt levels. The planned
adjustment emphasizes both revenue mobilization, especially through a broadening of the tax
base, and current expenditure restraint, and has garnered strong political and social support. The
success and durability of the adjustment will hinge in significant part on the authorities’ ability to
bring down the cost of the civil service; for that, carrying through the related structural reforms
will be crucial. An equitable burden-sharing in the adjustment effort will also require efforts to
curb tax evasion, especially pronounced in sectors with a large share of self-employed. Social
programs are being strengthened to protect the most vulnerable.
47.
The debt restructuring negotiations are progressing satisfactorily. The authorities
have taken credible steps to correct the stock imbalances, by elaborating a comprehensive public
debt restructuring strategy and initiating negotiations with the external and domestic creditors.
Staff supports the authorities’ intention to seek a substantial nominal principal reduction in the

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

37

GRENADA

face value of public debt, to deal once-and-for-all with the debt overhang and set the country on
a path to sustainable growth. Staff concludes that the authorities are in compliance with the
Fund’s financing assurances and arrears policies, based on its judgment that the arrangement is
fully financed for the next 12 months, with good prospects to fill the gap during and after the
arrangement; on their plan to request financing assurances from the Paris Club prior to the
approval of the arrangement and regularize arrears to official creditors during the period of the
arrangement; as well as on their good faith efforts to reach collaborative agreement with their
private creditors.
48.
In addition to the policy correction, the program envisages structural changes to
strengthen the fiscal policy-making framework and institutions. The authorities will
introduce fiscal responsibility legislation to promote fiscal accountability, transparency and
macro-fiscal stability, including through the introduction of spending and wage-cap rules. While
fiscal responsibility legislation will not be a substitute for commitment to prudent fiscal policy, it
will focus government attention and efforts on building strong fiscal institutions. Public financial
management will also be strengthened, especially to make the budgeting process more
meaningful, curtail discretion to spend above budget, and strengthen the government’s ability to
control expenditure commitments.
49.
While the fiscal adjustment could ease competitiveness pressures, bold structural
reforms are needed to improve Grenada’s potential growth and competitiveness. These
reforms will focus on reducing electricity costs through regulatory reforms and opening the
market for renewable electricity generation, wage cost moderation, and reduction in markups.
Structural impediments to higher growth and investment will also be tackled through the
liberalization of key agricultural markets and improvements in the investment environment.
While these reforms are not expected to yield short-term results, they will firmly turn the
economy towards a path of a higher potential growth and employment.
50.
Proactive engagement with the ECCB is needed to secure the stability and health of
Grenada’s financial system. The authorities support and are participating in the regional
strategy to strengthen the regional banking system and improve its regulation and supervision.
At the same time, if consensus on the pace of regional reforms stalls, the program envisages
that―with help from the ECCB― Grenada will move ahead with an independent assessment of
the asset quality of its banking system. The results of the assessment will be used to design a
comprehensive strategy to strengthen the financial position of banks in Grenada. In the nonbanking sector, the authorities have made significant progress in overhauling the regulation and
supervision of credit unions and insurance companies, and will continue with reforms during the
program period.
51.
The authorities have shown strong ownership of the reform effort, demonstrated
by the important policy measures they have already undertaken since late 2013. Their
readiness to address the difficult challenges facing the country, the ambitious reforms they

38

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

GRENADA

intend to undertake and the substantial assistance from Grenada’s international partners, bode
well for the chances of addressing the country’s debt overhang.
52.
Nevertheless, program implementation will be challenging. Risks to the program are
largely driven by the potential for a slower-than-expected economic recovery and by severe
capacity constraints. To deal with these, the program envisages contingency adjustment and
financing measures to ensure that unanticipated developments do not derail the program, and
will also seek to identify technical assistance and donor support for all major reforms in the
program. In light of Grenada’s balance of payment financing needs and the strength of their
proposed reforms to restore macroeconomic imbalances, staff supports the authorities’ request
for a three-year Extended Credit Facility arrangement amounting to SDR 14.04 million.
53.
The staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation be held on the 24month consultation cycle in accordance with the provisions of Decision No. 14747, as
amended, on consultation cycles.

Figure 3. Grenada: External Developments
The current account deficit has narrowed significantly since
2006, although remained above 20 percent of GDP over the
past few years and widened in 2013 due to a large-scale resort
construction.

Both imports and exports have been subdued at relatively
low levels over the past few years.

FDI declined in recent years, except in 2013 when they surged
with the construction of the Sandals resort.

Until 2013, the external deficits were increasingly financed
through debt flows, as banks accumulated foreign liabilities
through inflows of nonresident deposits and borrowing from
headquarters by foreign banks. The latter flows reversed in 2013.

The sovereign default and limited opportunities for profitable
lending to the private sector led to a precipitous slowdown in
credit growth, which was negative throughout 2013.

This, along with overall deposit stability, has kept bank excess

Nature/Source of Main Risks

Relative
Likelihood

Expected Impact

Recommended Policy Response

1. Protracted period of slower
growth in advanced and
emerging economies.

High

High
Slower growth elsewhere could directly
dampen Grenada’s growth through lower
tourism arrivals, remittances, and FDI. The
fiscal position could also worsen with
weaker revenues.

Carry through with the
programmed fiscal adjustment
and structural reforms, which
would increase the probability of
continued FDI and donor flows.

2. Escalation of financial
sector stress in the ECCU.
Lack of a lender of last resort,
deposit insurance, and fiscal
space, make the weak regional
banking systems vulnerable to
liquidity stress.
3. Natural disasters, mainly
hurricanes, could cause severe
damage to infrastructure and
disrupt tourism flows.

Medium

High
Lack of a financial backstop could lead to
a disorderly adjustment to deposit
withdrawals, credit retrenchment and
lower growth. The potential need to
eventually bail out depositors could
further increase the unsustainable debt.
High
The cost of infrastructure rehabilitation
would put further pressures on the fiscal
position. The disruption to the hotel plant
would slow tourism inflows, reduce growth
and widen the current account deficit.

Accelerate banking sector reforms
at the regional level, and agree on
a backstopping mechanism in the
context of the regional reforms
before banks are resolved.

4. Sustained decline in
commodity prices triggered
by deceleration of global
demand and coming-onstream of excess capacity
(medium-term)

Medium

5. Disruption in the
PetroCaribe
Arrangement with Venezuela
(Annex VII)

High

Medium

Medium
A decline in oil prices could tighten
liquidity in the regional financial markets
that largely stems from the oil-producing
Trinidad and Tobago. This could increase
rollover risks for the sovereign T-bills and
lead to some withdrawal of nonresident
deposits in banks. At the same time, the
external current account would benefit
from a reduced fuel import bill.
Medium
Pressures on the balance of payment and
fiscal financing available through the
arrangement could result is some decline
in reserves and a tighter financing
envelope for the government.

Build financing buffers by saving
receipts from the recently
introduced citizenship-byinvestment program and
obtaining supplementary natural
disaster insurance with donor
assistance. In the long-term, work
with the World Bank to build
resilience to climate change.
Build fiscal and financing buffers
by carrying through the fiscal
adjustment and saving receipts
from the recently introduced
citizenship-by-investment
program. Support regional
reforms to build capital cushions
in banks.

Same as in risks 1-4.

Same as in risks 1-4.
Low
Spillovers from the international (as
opposed to regional) financial markets are
low, given the relative insulation from
traditional capital flows. At the same time,
some outflow of nonresident deposits
when interest differentials narrow could
put pressures on the balance of payments.
1/ The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to
materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks
surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30
percent, and “high” a probability of 30 percent of more). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of
concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.
6. Side-effects from global
financial conditions: surges in
global financial market volatility
(related to UMP exit), leading to
economic and fiscal stress, and
constraints on country policy
settings.

Annex II. Grenada: Debt Sustainability Analysis
Grenada’s public debt is in distress. The country defaulted on debt payments in March 2013 and a
debt service moratorium is in effect while debt restructuring negotiations are underway. Public debt
is estimated at around 110 percent of GDP at end-2013, one of the highest in the world. In the
absence of consolidation and debt restructuring, public debt would increase to over 134 percent of
GDP by 2020, more than twice the regional target (60 percent of GDP by 2020). The authorities’
planned fiscal adjustment, if maintained over the medium-term, will reverse the debt dynamics and
put debt on a firmly downward path. However, in the absence of a debt restructuring and only with
non-market financing, debt would fall to only 89 percent of GDP by 2020, a high level given the
country’s growth prospects and capacity. The risk of debt distress will continue to remain high as all
debt and debt service thresholds would be breached even in the absence of shocks. The
comprehensive debt restructuring currently being pursued by the authorities will be critical to
reducing debt to sustainable levels, lowering the risk of debt distress, and putting the ECCU target
within reach.

Grenada has one of the highest public debt-to-GDP ratios in the world. As of end-2013, the
stock of central government’s direct and guaranteed debt (henceforth public debt) is estimated
at around 110 percent of GDP. Over a third of the debt is held domestically (37 percent of GDP),
mostly by commercial banks, other financial institutions and statutory bodies. External debt is
owed to multilateral creditors (27 percent of GDP), especially the Caribbean Development Bank
(15 percent of GDP); commercial creditors (24½ percent of GDP); Paris Club members (1.3
58 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

GRENADA

percent of GDP); and other bilateral creditors beside Paris Club (12.3 percent of GDP). At end2013, the total outstanding borrowing from the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank was about
1.4 percent of GDP.
The outlook for public debt is expected to improve notably under the program, but debt
will remain high and unsustainable without a restructuring. In the absence of debt
restructuring and fiscal adjustment, public debt would increase to over 134 percent of GDP by
2020, more than twice the regional target for that year. The fiscal adjustment targeted under the
program would put debt on a

financing gaps would not be
covered by marketable instruments.
The outlook for external public debt improves slightly over the medium-term. External
public debt would decline to about 62.7 percent of GDP by 2020, as the authorities rely
increasingly on external concessional sources to meet their financing needs, while paying down
domestic non-concessional debt. For the

external debt distress remains high and
unchanged from the assessment under previous DSAs (Figure A1, Tables 3a-b). The breach of
two of these thresholds (related to the debt service ratios) would occur only in the medium-term,
with the upcoming debt restructuring likely staving off these vulnerabilities. In the case of the
private external debt, it remains on an upward path in the medium-term as it finances large
current account deficits and will continue to present an important risk given the already high
levels.

The outlook for the public debt is based on the program’s macroeconomic framework. In
particular:


Real GDP Growth. Growth is projected to recover from 1½ percent estimated for 2013 to
about 2½ percent, with a continued recovery in the tourism and FDI source markets. While
the fiscal adjustment will have some dampening effect on growth over the next three years,
the drag is expected to be limited by the high openness of the economy, the resumption of
financing flows and the resolution of lingering uncertainty associated with the current crisis.
 Inflation. Inflation is projected to pick up gradually to about 2 percent over the medium-term
in line with higher imported U.S. inflation.
 Fiscal Balance. The primary balance of the central government is programmed to turn from a
deficit of 3⅔ percent of GDP in 2013 to a surplus of 3½ percent by 2016, reflecting the
significant and front-loaded fiscal adjustment effort during the three years of the program.
The adjustment relies on both revenue and expenditure measures, including increasing the
personal income tax thresholds, freezing the public wage bill and other measures. The
baseline scenario does not assume the materialization of any contingent liabilities, including
in the financial sector, although the risks are present.
 Proposed ECF arrangement. Public debt developments are considered in the context of a
three-year ECF arrangement with access of SDR14.04 million (120 percent of quota). The
disbursements are programmed to become available on a semiannual basis following the
Board’s approval of reviews. Grenada’s proposed access is high, above the 75 percent of
quota norm for a country with outstanding concessional credit of 100-200 percent of quota.
 Debt Restructuring. This DSA’s baseline scenario assumes fiscal adjustment but does not
include debt restructuring.
 Financing. Financing gaps in the DSA are assumed to be filled by exceptional IFI financing
during the 2014-17 program period (expected at US$81.9 million, or about 9.4 percent of
GDP, from IMF, World Bank and CDB) and by borrowing on terms similar to official bilateral
debt (2 percent interest, 7 years grace and 20 years maturity).

The comprehensive debt restructuring, on which the authorities have embarked, will help
address the fiscal imbalances. The restructuring will exclude the treasury bills issued in the
regional securities markets (to avoid contagion to other ECCU sovereigns that tap that market)
and loans from multilateral institutions (together accounting for 29 percent of public debt). With
assistance from financial and legal advisors, the authorities have initiated debt restructuring
negotiations. Discussions have now extended to all creditor groups, and those with external
private creditors have continued through scheduled weekly calls. The authorities will approach
the Paris Club creditors before the Board approval of the arrangement to request financing
assurances and seek agreement on a date to discuss the treatment of its debt, including
outstanding arrears. In future reviews, staff will provide updates on the status of the debt
negotiations and will assess the outcomes at their conclusion.

1/ Includes public sector external debt only.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
The large residuals in external DSA reflect the fact that the template does not capture capital grants.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly
assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Annex III. Grenada: Competitiveness Issues and Exchange
Rate Assessment
The long-standing competitiveness challenges facing Grenada have only increased since
the global financial crisis. The country’s share in the Caribbean tourism market has declined
notably since 2007, as the recovery after the 2004-05 hurricanes was thwarted by the global
financial crisis and is now 66 percent of its pre-hurricane shares. On the goods side, Grenada’s
market share of nutmeg, a major agriculture export, plunged from about a fifth of world nutmeg
trade in early 2000’s to about 3 percent after the hurricanes destroyed almost all of the crops in
2004-05. Grenada’s real exchange rate, measured against its tourist origin markets, appreciated
significantly following the global financial crisis and has since remained 13 percent more
appreciated relative to the pre-crisis period. This partly reflects the rapid depreciation of the U.K.
Pound Sterling during 2008 as well as the low inflation in most of Grenada’s tourist origin
markets. 1 Measured against tourism competitor markets, the exchange rate has also appreciated
during 2013, as inflation in Grenada is much lower than most of its competitors.

As a result, Grenada’s external position failed to recover meaningfully in the posthurricane period. The current account deficits have settled around 20 percent of GDP,
compared to 8½ percent of GDP during the 1990s. With receding foreign direct investment, the
deficits have been increasingly financed by debt, deteriorating Grenada’s net foreign liability
position to more than 270 percent of GDP in 2012, among the highest in the world.

Formal exchange rate assessments point to a likely overvaluation of the exchange rate.
Two of the methods under IMF’s CGER-type assessments (macro balance and external
sustainability) suggest an overvaluation in the range of 12½–34¼ percent, while the third one
(equilibrium real exchange rate) suggests the exchange rate is broadly in line with its equilibrium
levels.


The macro balance approach (which relies on the gap between the underlying current
account balance and the fundamentals-driven savings-investment norm) implies a
potential real exchange rate overvaluation of 34¼ percent, since the projected gap
between the two current account measures remains at about 7 percent of GDP over the
medium-term despite the large fiscal consolidation.2



The external sustainability approach
suggests a current account balance
adjustment of 2½ percent of GDP is
required to stabilize Grenada’ net
foreign liability position. This would
imply a potential exchange rate
overvaluation of about 12½ percent.3



And finally, the equilibrium real
exchange rate approach shows broadly
no misalignment of the exchange rate,

The potential overvaluation is calculated as the REER adjustment required to close the current account balance gap in
the medium term, based on elasticity of the current account balance to real exchange rate (-0.21 in the case of
Grenada). Same calculation applies to the potential overvaluation yielded by the External Stability approach.

The appreciation of the equilibrium real exchange rate during the 2009–12 period, opposing the depreciation trend of
the actual REER that generally tracked the U.S. Dollar, is due to the relative (to its trading partners, most of whom have
undergone strong fiscal consolidation) higher government consumptions in Grenada. The model interprets that such
higher government consumption may lead to higher non-tradable prices and subsequently REER appreciation in
Grenada.

The National Insurance Scheme (NIS) in Grenada is a defined benefit plan created in 1983, to
which employees contribute 4 percent and the employer 5 percent. Self-employed pay the
employer contribution as well. The mandatory retirement age is 60 years and the maximum
replacement value under NIS is 60 percent of the five highest years of earnings. The NIS covered
about 43,096 workers in 2012 or about 85 percent of the employed population. The NIS provided
protection for several benefits: old-age, disability, death, employment injury, maternity and
sickness. The NIS’ operations are overseen by the National Insurance Board (NIB) which is a
corporate body, consisting of members appointed from government, the local workers’
organization and the private sector. Actuarial reviews are done every three years. The last review
was done in 2009 and next review is expected to be completed by June 2014. While Grenada’s
population is still relatively young, the population dynamics of Grenada has been changing over
time. Fertility rates have been declining, but life expectancy has been increasing and migration of
working age population to other ECCU countries,

NIS Financial Position
Income and Assets. Almost two-thirds of the NIS annual income comes from contributions,
while the remaining third derives from NIS investments, largely in non-financial assets such as
real estate. Income derived from government paper is relatively small, but increased from less
than EC$2 million in 2008 to almost EC$5 million in 2013 (18 percent of total income). On the
asset side, NIS exposure to central government papers stood at EC$186.8 million (8.5 percent of
GDP or 25 percent of assets) at end-2012, of which EC$92 million were holdings of the EC$ 2025
bond issued in the 2005 restructuring. Excluding RGSM T-bills that will not be restructured, the
total exposure to the central government is EC$175 million (8 percent of GDP or 23 percent of
assets). In addition, NIS has exposure to various statutory bodies totaling EC$58.5 million
(2.7% of GDP).

Cash position. The NIS has been running an
operational surplus, which narrowed during the
downturn of 2009-11, as unemployment
increased and the contribution base shrunk.
Since the crisis, the revenue growth slowed from
an average of 10 percent per year during 200008 to about zero thereafter. The impact of these
weaker earnings was also compounded by
higher levels of expenditure as NIS had to
provision due to losses stemming from its
investment stake in BAICO and CLICO.

The 2009 actuarial review. The last actuarial review of the NIS in 2009 estimated that
expenditures will exceed contributions by 2017 and total income by 2029. After 2029, the
operational deficit will continue to grow and the reserve is expected to begin to decrease in the
next decade, to be completely depleted by 2042. Based on the findings, the review made
recommendation for parametric changes to sustain the NIS. The main recommendations of the
actuarial review were to (i) increase the retirement age from 60 to 65; (ii) increase the
contribution rates to 11 percent (5 percent employee + 6 percent employer) from the current
rate of 9 percent (4 percent employee + 5 percent employer); (iii) increase the insurable limit
gradually, since current limits were very small for high income brackets.1 The government is
evaluating reform options and waiting for the outcome of the 2013 actuarial review (expected in
June) before making the final decision.

Impact of debt restructuring on the NIS position
Under the program’s macro-framework and assuming no debt restructuring, the projected cash
flow position for 2014-2042 remains broadly similar to the one projected by the 2009 actuarial

review: NIS begins running deficits in 2028 and the reserves get depleted by 2042.2 The debt
restructuring will have a negative impact on the financial position of the NIS, although for the
public sector as a whole this loss will be fully offset by the gain in the central government’s
position. As an illustration, assuming that NIS takes a 50/60 percent haircut on restructurable
government papers, the onset of the operational deficits and reserve depletion will be
accelerated by five/six years, to 2022/23 and 2036/37, respectively. Over the medium term, NIS
will therefore continue to run operational surpluses and can address the longer-term challenges
through parametric reforms.

`Grenada has 24 statutory bodies, of which nine operate as commercial entities and one is
the National Insurance Board that manages the pension fund.1 The financial performance
and service provision of many of the statutory bodies (SBs) has been poor, but data are scarce.
Most of the SBs for which data are available reported a loss in 2012, except for NIS which is
running operational profits.

Relations with the budget. SBs do not make significant payments to the budget and have not
paid dividends for a number of years. Even though the government has contributed minimal
equity to SBs, they have made significant contribution to SBs assets in terms provision of land
and buildings. Three SBs (Development Bank, Industrial Development Corporation and Gravel
Concrete and Emulsion Corporation) have defaulted on some of their debt in recent times which
has been taken over by the government). On the other hand, the government has accumulated
significant arrears to SBs, including the National Insurance Board (EC$30 million), the Solid Waste
Management Authority (EC$19million) and the Water and Sewerage Authority (EC$10.5million).
These arrears have also negatively impacted the daily operations of the SBs. Moreover, with the
exception of the Gravel Concrete and Emulsion Corporation and the Marketing and National
Importing Board, all SBs benefit from exemptions VAT and customs exemptions (currently being
reformed). The government transfers to SBs were relatively small in 2012 (only EC$2 million or
0.1% of GDP).

The financial results and position of several SBs have been impacted by government
decisions to approve substantial wage increases and unsustainable pension schemes, as
well as by the collapse of regional insurance companies BAICO and CLICO. In general, SBs
remuneration and employee benefits are substantially higher than those in the rest of the public
service. Despite the small numbers of employees and the high administrative costs, many SBs
have separate pension schemes. Many of these schemes are overly generous and there are
significant unfunded pension liabilities. Grenada’s SB finances have also been significantly
impacted by the financial collapse of the regional insurance company BAICO/ CLICO. The Ports
Authority, Development Bank, Water and Sewerage Authority and National Insurance Board had
to write off significant amounts for asset impairment reflecting their investment in these
companies.
The monitoring of the statutory bodies is weak due to lack of financial information and
lack of capacity. SBs are required by the legislation to submit their audited financial statements
to the Parliament, but most SBs don’t report their financial statements on a regular basis, making
it difficult to assess their financial situation and viability. In 2012, more than half of SBs reported
their financial statements six months after the end of the calendar year. While officials of the
Ministry of Finance (MoF) are Board members of SBs, which provides a forum for SB monitoring,
there is no unit at the MoF that monitors the statutory bodies on a regular basis and the MoF
also yields little control over the financials of the SBs.

Annex VI. Grenada: Petrocaribe Arrangement
The Petrocaribe arrangement in Grenada is operated by PDV Grenada Ltd., a joint venture
between the governments of Venezuela and Grenada since 2007. PDV Grenada imports
diesel fuel from Venezuela at international prices, usually about one shipment per month with an
average of 18 thousand barrels per shipment. It then sells the fuel in the local market at market
prices plus a certain markup to cover its operational costs. If the oil price exceeds US$100 per
barrel, then 40 percent of the import invoice is repaid to Venezuela, otherwise 50 percent is
repaid. The rest of the invoice is converted into a long-term concessional loan, repayable over
25 years, with 2 years of grace period and an annual interest rate of 1 percent.
The resources from the concessional loan have to be used for social projects and financial
investments. In particular, 35 percent of the loan is allocated to a social fund to be spent on
social projects, and the remaining 65 percent goes to a trust fund that makes financial
investments. The purpose of the investments is to generate sufficient returns to offset the cost of
the social projects, thereby generating the resources needed to service the long-term loan. At
present, the trust fund has mainly invested in securities issued by Grenada and other
governments in the region. Meanwhile, the money from the social fund is transferred to the
central government as “grant” from the rest of the public sector and has averaged 0.8 percent of
GDP over the past five years, financing investment and social programs.

The stock of the long-term debt of PDV Grenada to Venezuela has reached US$102.4
million or 12.6 percent of GDP at end-2013.1 The annual financing under the arrangement
averaged US$21 million or 2.6 percent of GDP over the past three years, which provided a
notable relief in financing the large current account deficit. Despite recent fiscal financing
pressures, the loans have been serviced on time as Grenada depends on the continued flow of
financing.

1

Because PDV Grenada is incorporated under the Companies Act 1994 as a limited liability company, the
government’s liability is limited only to the unpaid amounts (if any) on shares it holds in the company (i.e. the
government is not liable for the debts of the company). Therefore this debt is excluded from the stocks of central
government contracted or guaranteed debt.

In the event of disruptions in the Petrocaribe arrangement, Grenada could face cutbacks in
social spending and notable balance of payment pressures. Grants from the social fund have
financed about 40½ percent of the total social spending in 2013, particularly in the areas of
education, employment support, and

Appendix I. Letter of Intent

June 12, 2014
Ms. Christine Lagarde
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431
Dear Ms. Lagarde,

The Grenadian economy has faced unprecedented challenges over the past decade. In addition
to the long-standing problems of low growth and high unemployment, the country has faced its
largest natural disaster and the most prolonged recession since independence. This in turn
exacerbated its already weak fiscal position, despite our attempts to strengthen it in the context
of the previous two IMF-supported programmes. These challenges have been feeding each other
in a vicious circle, coming to a head in 2012-13 in a full-blown fiscal crisis. Public debt reached
about 110 percent of GDP at end 2013, and the inability to meet financial obligations led to the
announcement of a debt restructuring in early 2013.
In the February 2013 elections, the New National Party government took office with a very strong
mandate to govern. The Government sees this mandate as an opportunity to fundamentally
tackle the challenges facing the Grenadian economy. With this in mind, it has developed a
comprehensive home-grown reform programme for 2014-17, as described in the attached
Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP). The programme aims to restore
macroeconomic stability in the short term and promote strong, sustainable, and inclusive growth
in the medium term. The main pillars of the programme include an ambitious fiscal adjustment
supported by public financial management reforms and debt restructuring; structural reforms to
promote a business-friendly environment, growth and job creation; and measures to strengthen
financial system safety and stability.
In support of our economic programme, the Government requests a 36-month arrangement
under the Extended Credit Facility from the International Monetary Fund in an amount equivalent
to SDR 14.04 million (120 percent of Grenada’s quota, about US$21.9 million at current exchange
rates). The ECF arrangement will provide needed financing during the adjustment period and
signal our determination to implement sound policies, catalyze additional financial and technical
assistance from other international donors, and boost investor and business confidence. Progress
in the implementation of our programme will be assessed through semi-annual reviews,
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

quantitative performance criteria, indicative targets, and agreed structural benchmarks as
described in the attached memorandum.
We are confident that the policies set forth in the memorandum are adequate to meet the
objectives of the programme. We stand ready to take any additional measures that may become
appropriate for this purpose as circumstances change. As is customary under Fund-supported
programmes, we will consult with the Fund on the adoption of such measures in advance of
necessary policy revisions. We will also provide the Fund staff with all the relevant information
required to complete programme reviews and monitor performance.
We consent to the publication of this letter, the attached MEFP and Technical Memorandum of
Understanding, and the related staff report.

Sincerely,

Attachment I. Memorandum of Economic and Financial
Policies for 2014-17
1.
In response to significant macroeconomic challenges faced by Grenada over the past
several years, the Government has put together a comprehensive programme to restore fiscal
sustainability and boost inclusive growth through macroeconomic stabilization and structural
reforms. This memorandum sets out Grenada’s economic and financial policies for 2014-17, to be
supported by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) under a 36-month Extended Credit Facility
(ECF) arrangement.
I. ECONOMIC CONTEXT
2.
Grenada faced numerous challenges over the past years and was particularly hard
hit by the global recession. During 2004–05, Grenada suffered severe damage in the wake of
two hurricanes (estimated at around 150 percent of GDP, compared to about 20 percent on
average for the three most affected countries in the aftermath of the 2004 Asian tsunami), whose
economic and fiscal impact triggered a debt restructuring in 2005. Before recovery from these
natural disasters could gain ground, the country was hit hard by the global recession. Real
activity declined by 8.2 percent from its pre-crisis peak during 2009–12. The unemployment rate
stood at 33½ percent in September 2013, with youth unemployment as high as 55.6 percent.
3.
To cushion the effects of the natural disasters and the global crisis, Grenada
obtained support from the IMF through two ECF arrangements during 2006-12. The first
arrangement (2006-10)―undertaken by the current Government―was successfully completed,
but the second arrangement (2010-12) went off-track after the first review. The hiatus in the
programme was caused in part by the very difficult political and economic situation, with a
minority government facing a severe economic downturn and general elections. Nevertheless,
successive Governments have persevered with several reforms contemplated in the programme,
including modernizing customs and tax administration, reinforcing the supervision of the
nonbank institutions, and strengthening social safety nets
4.
The protracted recession has exacerbated the macroeconomic imbalances. Large
fiscal financing needs – reflecting high debt and fiscal deficits averaging 5 percent of GDP over
the past decade (recently due to a significant decline in revenues) – led to acute financing
difficulties during the past few years, culminating in a default in March 2013 and bringing forth
the need to restructure existing public debt obligations, which reached about 110 percent of
GDP by end-2013. The external current account deficit remains large and has been increasingly
financed by debt as FDI flows have receded.
5.
Grenada’s economic potential has not been fully realized in the face of weak price
and structural competitiveness, a high debt overhang, and vulnerability to external shocks.
Over the past two decades, growth has been too weak to make a meaningful dent in

unemployment. Higher and more sustainable growth remains critical to making the country’s
development more inclusive.
II. MEDIUM-TERM MACROECONOMIC FRAMEWORK
6.
Against this background, the Government’s economic programme aims to restore
macroeconomic stability, strengthen the fiscal position, and most importantly boost
economic growth. During the programme period, we expect that the resolution of the fiscal
crisis will bolster confidence in the country’s economic prospects. There are already encouraging
signs that growth has resumed after an almost four-year decline, and is estimated to have picked
up to at least 1½ percent (market prices) in 2013. With a continued recovery in the tourism and
FDI inflows, growth is expected to pick up steadily over the medium-term to about 2½ percent,
in line with historical growth over the past twenty years. While the fiscal adjustment effort
targeted under the programme (7¾ percent of GDP during three years) will have some
dampening effect on growth in the short run, the drag is expected to be limited by the high
openness of the economy and is expected to be offset by the resumption of financing flows and
the resolution of lingering uncertainty associated with the current crisis. Inflation is projected to
remain subdued in the face of a negative output gap and moderate commodity price inflation,
and the external imbalances are expected to narrow gradually during the programme period,
reflecting the improvement in the fiscal balance and a recovery in exports.

III. ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL PROGRAMME
7.
The main objective of Government’s economic programme is to create conditions
for higher economic growth that is sustainable, job-creating and inclusive. This will require
strong policy action to: (i) create conditions for an expansion in private sector activity and
employment through the implementation of deep structural reforms, while strengthening the
social safety nets to protect the most vulnerable; (ii) return the public sector to solvency, which
will support growth prospects through the resolution of the fiscal crisis and the debt overhang;
and (iii) ensure the continued stability of the financial sector in the face of a difficult economic
environment.

A. Reforms to Boost Growth and Social Protection
8.
Boosting the economy’s growth, while strengthening the social safety net, is the
main priority of the Government’s economic programme. Raising Grenada’s growth potential
will require tackling weaknesses in both price and structural competitiveness. Structural reforms
will therefore focus on improvements in the business climate, on reducing the cost of doing
business (especially relating to electricity and import costs), and on other measures to support
activity during the fiscal adjustment process.

80

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

GRENADA

9.
Moving the economy to a path of higher and more sustainable growth requires a
propitious operating environment for the private sector. In this context, the Government will
move speedily to strengthen the Investment Promotion Act of 2009 and to have the Act acceded
to law. The aim is to improve the business environment and enhance Grenada’s attractiveness as
an investment destination through: (i) streamlining investment procedures, cutting excess “red
tape” and addressing other bottlenecks such as land acquisitions and planning approval; (ii)
codifying all the requirements for investment or for opening a business in the legislation; (iii)
codifying all tax incentives and the associated qualifying criteria in the law; and (iv) transforming
the Grenada Industrial Development Corporation into a functioning one-stop shop for investors
to reduce the time and cost of obtaining investment approval. Parliamentary approval of the
revised Investment Act in line with these reforms will be a structural benchmark for endNovember 2014.
10.
The Government will seek to harness the benefits of Private Public Partnerships
(PPPs) in promoting infrastructure development, while protecting the public funds from
inherent risks. The Government is considering PPP-based investments in several areas, such as
healthcare, energy and infrastructure, but will engage in them only after ensuring that PPPs bring
value for money, have adequate risk transfer and do not undermine the fiscal position. To this
effect, the Government will first adopt a PPP policy, followed by a comprehensive PPP legislation
to establish the principles and the institutions for assuming and managing contingent liabilities
associated with these arrangements (parliamentary approval of this legislation will be sought for
end-2014). Technical assistance and advisory support on this will be sought from the World Bank
and other donors.
11.
The Government will move to liberalize certain sectors to boost private sector
participation and expand capacity. Opportunities for renewable energy will be created as
described below to encourage the transition towards more sustainable and less expensive inputs
into electricity production. The Government will support the liberalization of the nutmeg and
cocoa sectors, so as to encourage increased efficiency, and boost farmers’ incomes.
12.
High electricity costs (among the highest in the world) pose a significant challenge
to the country’s price competitiveness. They reflect lack of economies of scale in the dieselbased generation, high fuel costs, and monopoly rents of Grenada’s only electricity company,
GRENLEC. The Government’s strategy in addressing the electricity costs―supported by technical
advice from the World Bank― is therefore two-pronged: (i) setting out the path for a transition
from fuel-based generation to one based on renewable energy (geothermal, solar and wind)
through policy and regulatory changes for renewable energy; and (ii) supporting the
establishment of an independent regulatory authority for a more efficient pricing of electricity.
To this effect, the Government will amend the Electricity Supply Act and revisit the agreement
with GRENLEC by end-December 2014 to (a) enable an effective regulation of the electricity
sector by the Eastern Caribbean Energy Regulatory Authority (ECERA); (b) address any cost
inefficiencies in GRENLEC through revised tariff-setting mechanisms; (c) set out the roadmap for
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

81

GRENADA

transitioning electricity generation to renewable energy through necessary regulatory and policy
measures for the renewable energy market; and (d) streamline the tax exemptions granted to
GRENLEC. The Government is also supporting efforts to explore the country’s geothermal
potential, and will seek donor assistance in taking these efforts to fruition.
13.
The Government’s recent bid to acquire the majority shares on sale in GRENLEC
―in response to the exclusive offer made by the seller to the Government and aimed at
facilitating the removal of the very onerous terms of the existing agreement – was deemed
too low by the seller. This bid was made under a contractual arrangement with an interested
buyer for the shares from Government. After the expiration of the Government’s offer, other
investors have expressed interest in purchasing GRENLEC. Under these circumstances, the
government is committed not to participate in the bidding moving forward, but will undertake
the required reforms in the electricity sector with the private owners.
14.
Pressures on labor costs frequently pose challenges to the economy’s
competitiveness and policy sustainability. The main pressures are in the public sector, where
wage increases frequently outstrip the Government’s capacity to make the payments and drive
wage increases elsewhere in the economy, and on labor costs at the main port. On wages, the
Government has initiated tripartite discussions under Social Partnership Agreements―with
participation of private sector, trade unions and the civil society―to reach understanding on the
macroeconomic fundamentals that would underlie collective bargaining agreements, especially
during times of weak economic growth. The short-term objective is to reach understandings on
the need to set wages in line with macroeconomic fundamentals and in advance of the
negotiated triennium (rather than ex-post, as has been the case to date). With regard to port
charges, the Government will review the existing labor agreements in ports by end-June 2015,
with a view to streamlining labor charges as warranted. The government will also seek to revise
the Labor Code, in consultation with its Social Partners, with a view to improving the
competitiveness of the overall labor market.
15.
To protect the most vulnerable groups during the period of fiscal adjustment,
Government will increase and better target assistance to poor households. For fiscal year
2014, the Government will increase allocations to the largest targeted social assistance
programme Support for Education, Employment, Empowerment and Development (SEED) by
40 percent to EC$13⅔ million (0.6 percent of GDP), reaching 5,690 households (about a sixth of
all households), and will establish a floor on spending on this programme so that any pressure to
reduce spending does not affect the targeted social safety nets. The Government will also
explore with donors potential support to further expand targeted assistance schemes during the
period of fiscal adjustment. In addition, it will improve the targeting and coverage of social
assistance programmes, which are currently fragmented across ministries, by compiling an
inventory of all social assistance programmes, establishing a registry of beneficiaries of these
programmes and introducing proxy means testing as the eligibility criterion for the flagship SEED
programme before end-2014, to be subsequently rolled out to other social programmes. The

82

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

GRENADA

Government will seek technical assistance from the World Bank for these reforms, with a view to
developing a coherent social protection strategy, including establishing links between social
assistance programmes and actions that promote human capital. This strategy will serve as the
basis for the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper that the Government intends to finalize in 2014.

B. Restoring Fiscal Sustainability
16.
A lasting reduction in the debt level is needed to restore fiscal sustainability and
create a stable macroeconomic environment for growth. The Government aims to reduce
debt from the current about 110 percent of GDP to the ECCU-wide target of 60 percent of GDP
by 2020, which would require a combination of fiscal adjustment, debt restructuring, and fiscal
structural reforms to ensure durable fiscal discipline going forward.
Fiscal Consolidation
17.
The first pillar of the Government’s fiscal programme is a strong fiscal
consolidation effort aimed at putting debt on a downward path. The Government has taken
measures already in 2013 to stem the rapid deterioration of the fiscal position, limiting the
primary deficit in that year to 3⅔ percent of GDP, notably below its budgeted target of
4.2 percent of GDP (outcomes consistent with the budget was a prior action). Going forward, a
fiscal adjustment effort of 7¾ percent of GDP will bring the primary balance into a surplus of
3½ percent of GDP by 2016, which will put debt on a declining path even under reasonable
shocks. The adjustment will be frontloaded, to help meet the higher financing requirements early
in the programme, with 5.6 percentage points of GDP undertaken during the first two years. To
mitigate the impact of this adjustment on the nascent economic recovery and the most
vulnerable, the Government will establish a floor on social spending for targeted programmes
and will safeguard critical infrastructure programmes by allocating, fiscal space permitting, at
least 7 percent of GDP to the public sector investment programme on average during the next
three years. For the medium term, our objective is to achieve the ECCU-wide target of 60 percent
of debt-GDP ratio by 2020.
18.
The fiscal consolidation will rely on measures that ensure a broader and a more
equitable participation in the tax effort, as well as reductions in less productive spending.
These will include:


A reduction in the personal income tax threshold−which is among the highest in the
world and excludes most income earners from the tax net− from the current EC$60,000
to EC$36,000 in 2014. A lower rate of 15 percent will apply to income below EC$60,000,
while the rate for income above EC$60,000 will remain unchanged at 30 percent.



Boosting income and withholding tax collection by extending the income tax base to
winnings from lotteries and games of chance, to come into effect in 2014.



An increase in property tax collections through an increase in the property tax rate on
buildings and land from 0.1-0.15 percent to double those amounts in 2014, and to an
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

83

GRENADA

average of 0.5 percent in 2016, as well as through a revaluation of assessed property
values to reflect market valuations. Once the primary balance targeted under the
programme (3½ percent) has been achieved, the Government intends to reduce the
currently high property transfer taxes to encourage the development of a more vibrant
real estate market.

84



Streamlining tax exemptions to ensure equitable burden-sharing through: (i) a 50 percent
reduction in tax exemptions to GRENLEC, the largest beneficiary of exemptions, statutory
bodies, St. George’s University and the returning nationals; (ii) reducing the tax rebate to
manufacturers by eliminating credits accumulated during 2010-13; allowing the use of
the rebate against non-VAT liabilities only; capping the annual fiscal loss to EC$2.5
million; and discontinue the program fully after 2016; and (iii) reforming the tax incentive
regime to ensure the integrity of the tax base going forward (detailed below). The first
two measures will be effective from 2014 (excluding St. George’s University, which will be
effective in 2016).



The base of the VAT will be expanded by (i) applying VAT to select exempt items (nonbasic food, private accommodations); and (ii) applying the full 15 percent rate to
construction inputs (from 2014) and utilities provided to St. George’s University (from
2016).



Broadening the base and yield of excises by: (i) introducing a 5 percent excise on luxury
goods and on vehicle parts, tires, batteries, and motor oil; and (ii) increasing the excise
tax on alcohol and tobacco products by at least 10 percent.



Other revenue-enhancing measures will include: (i) the introduction of a small business
tax regime for firms with sales between EC$30,000 and the VAT threshold (EC$120,000),
charging a flat rate of 5 percent on gross sales; (ii) the introduction of a 10 percent tax on
financial activities (wages and profits of financial institutions); (iii) increased fees on motor
vehicle, professional and gun licenses; (iv) fees for new government guarantees on the
debt of statutory bodies; and (v) an increase in the customs service charge from
5 to 6 percent.



The Government also intends to undertake a revenue-neutral simplification of the tax
system by way of overcoming resource constraints and improving compliance. Technical
assistance on this, and on the introduction of the small business tax regime, was
requested from the IMF.



Increased efforts to collect taxes that are due will also be critical in supporting the fiscal
consolidation. The parliament has recently passed a revised Integrity in Public Life law
intended to strengthen governance and facilitate higher levels of integrity throughout
the government, including in revenue collecting agencies. Going forward, efforts will
focus on fully implementing the reform agenda that has already been developed with
support from CARTAC that includes: (i) completing institutional reforms to focus on risk
management and large tax payers; (ii) eliminating the bonus for tax collectors on interest
from tax arrears, with a view to correcting the disincentives to collect on the large stock

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

GRENADA

of existing arrears (prior action); (iii) introducing a strict sanction regime for late payment
of taxes due (the relevant tax laws will be revised before end-November 2014); (iv)
connecting the customs and inland revenue information systems and ensuring exchange
of information between the two departments; (v) enacting the newly drafted Customs Bill
that will modernize the existing legislation and introduce penalties for noncompliance,
among other things (by end-June 2014); (vi) establishing an Internal Audit Unit at
Customs; and (vii) improving controls and monitoring of customs bonding warehouse, by
increasing audits and closing repeated non-compliant warehouses.


A reduction in central government’s nominal wage bill to 9 percent of GDP by 2016, from
a projected 10.3 percent in 2013 (excluding retroactive payments). This will be achieved,
at the minimum, by capping the nominal wage bill during 2014-16 (including allowances)
at May-December 2013 levels (this will bring the wage bill to a projected 9½ percent of
GDP by 2016). A further reduction in the wage bill will be achieved through attrition, with
only 3 out of 10 departing employees replaced; and through the streamlining in the
public sector following the planned public service review (see below). To facilitate the
achievement of the wage targets, we will: (a) eliminate at least 100 vacancies a year
during 2014-16 (previously used to grant higher salaries to existing staff); and (b) not
award performance increments for 2013-16 period, while improving the performance
appraisal system. These measures will also be supported by fiscal structural reforms that
would restrain public wage growth on a more sustainable basis (see below).



A 20 percent reduction in spending on goods and services relative to 2012, focused
especially on savings in the utilities bill, rental costs, and communication costs, through
renegotiation of telephone contracts, switching to energy-saving LED lights and the
consolidation of public offices. Other spending on goods and services will be frozen at
2013 levels. Other spending will also be streamlined, including investments of lower
social return and reforms of statutory bodies to reduce their drag on public finances (see
below).

19.
Most measures required for the consolidation will be secured upfront in order to
impart additional credibility to the adjustment effort.


The Government will obtain parliamentary approval of all the fiscal adjustment measures
listed in paragraph 18 that require legislative amendments as a prior action, although the
implementation of the measures will be staggered in line with the agreed pace of
consolidation. The only four exceptions to the ex-ante legislation of measures will be: (i)
the new taxes to be introduced in 2015 (financial activities tax and small business tax) will
be legislated during 2014 to allow adequate time for their proper design, technical
assistance for which will be sought from the IMF; (ii) the second round of property tax
increases for 2016 will be legislated after we assess the implementation of the first round
of increases; (iii) the fees for the new government guarantees will be enacted soon after
the post-restructuring technical assistance on public debt management, which we
requested from our international partners; and (iv) the measures associated with the
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

85

GRENADA

St. George’s University will be enacted before mid-2015, after the conclusion of our
ongoing renegotiations of the existing arrangements with the university.


Finally, the parliament approved the 2014 budget in line with the programmed primary
deficit target of 2½ percent of GDP. To ensure that primary spending is consistent with
the program if budgeted revenues do not materialize, the Government will take
additional safeguards to secure execution in line with the program, including: (i) issuing a
cabinet conclusion allowing spending commitments only up to the programmed, rather
than budgeted, spending; (ii) issuing spending authorizations in line with the
programmed spending targets, and only one quarter ahead, to strengthen our ability to
control spending commitments; and (iii) revising the Public Finance Management Act,
ahead of the planned overhaul of the public financial management legislation, to
introduce personal financial penalties for responsible officers committing to spending
above budgetary ceilings (items (i) and (ii) are a prior action for the program).

20.
To ensure that our consolidation efforts remain on track in the face of
unanticipated events, such as natural disasters, the Government will put in place a number
of measures. In particular:


It will seek donor assistance to purchase additional natural disaster insurance for the
duration of the programme to ensure that Government policies are not derailed by natural
disaster shocks. The Government estimates that the cost of this supplementary insurance
would be US$3-5 million per year (0.4-0.6 percent of GDP), providing a substantial level of
coverage for Grenada and representing 20 to 30 percent of the estimated average
annualized loss for the covered perils.



The Government has also identified contingent measures for up to 0.7 percent of GDP in
2014 that will be implemented to ensure that the fiscal consolidation does not fall short of
the target. These include: (i) reduced (only one-quarter-ahead) expenditure authorizations in
the first three quarters of the year compared to the program, with the remaining allocations
released once there is evidence that the fiscal programme is on track; and (ii) a further
widening of the income tax base to capital gains, dividends, and interest.

21.
The Government plans to clear its existing domestic and external arrears during the
programme period. A clearance framework for the existing stock of Government debt arrears
will be agreed on as part of the ongoing debt restructuring, and the Government will not incur
additional debt arrears during the duration of the programme outside the restructuring process.
Existing supplier arrears will be repaid through a combination of Government paper and cash
during the first two years of the program. The Government will not incur additional arrears on
membership fees to regional and international organizations from the start of the program, and
will seek to regularize these delayed payments in the course of 2015. In the context of public
financial management reforms, the Government will also strengthen the monitoring of
expenditure commitments to prevent future accumulation of arrears.

86

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

GRENADA

Debt Restructuring and Financing Assurances
22.
The second pillar of the fiscal programme is addressing the debt overhang through
a comprehensive debt restructuring. While the fiscal consolidation outlined above would set
debt on a firmly downward path, it will not be sufficient to bring a lasting solution to the
negative effects of the debt overhang that continue to stifle government finances and the
economy. Accordingly, the Government announced on March 8, 2013 that it will undertake a
“comprehensive and collaborative” restructuring of the public debt; this will supplement the fiscal
consolidation in reducing debt to reach the ECCU-wide debt target of 60 percent of GDP by
2020. The scope of the anticipated debt restructuring will be comprehensive, covering all public
and publicly guaranteed debt with the exception of loans from multilateral institutions and
Treasury bills issued on the regional government securities market (RGSM) in order to limit the
impact on the regional economy. The Government has contracted financial and legal advisors
and is working with them and creditors to advance the debt restructuring process.
23.
With the assistance from financial advisors, the Government has developed a
strategy for engaging with private and bilateral official creditors to achieve both cash flow
relief and materially reduce the overall stock of debt. The Government has met with the
commercial bondholders to begin discussing Grenada’s payment capacity and provide detailed
macroeconomic and debt information. The economic program outlined in this memorandum will
be the basis for discussions over appropriate restructuring terms, which got underway in March
2014. The Government also plans to request financing assurances from the Paris Club before the
IMF’s Executive Board meeting on the program request. We will also continue to engage our
bilateral non-Paris Club creditors to regularize existing arrears and restructure debt. In this
regard, agreements to reschedule arrears have already been reached with the OPEC Fund and
with Kuwait, which enabled them to make new disbursements to finance existing infrastructure
projects.
24.
Multilateral creditors will also contribute to support our adjustment program. In
addition to the assistance we are seeking from the IMF, both the World Bank and the Caribbean
Development Bank (CDB) are preparing new lending programs for Grenada, with expected
cumulative disbursements of US$30 million each during the three years of the arrangement. The
European Union also plans to resume its grant support for Grenada once an IMF program is in
place. After accounting for expected financial support from our official creditors, the remaining
financing gap is estimated at about US$350 million in 2014-17. About two thirds of this residual
financing gap will be closed through the regularization of existing arrears during the upcoming
debt negotiations, with the remaining one third closed through the restructuring of future
maturities. Consistent with the financing envelope of the programme, making satisfactory
progress in the negotiations with the creditors will be a prior action through: (i) initiating the
negotiation phase of the restructuring with private and bilateral official creditors, (ii) seeking
agreement on a debt restructuring consistent with closing the financing gap under the program
and reducing debt to 60 percent of GDP by 2020; (iii) obtaining financing assurances from the
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

87

GRENADA

Paris Club; and (iv) developing a credible timetable for advancing the restructuring discussions
with private creditors through mid-2014. Before the Board discussion of the program request, we
will also issue a supplementary Letter of Intent with an update on the progress made in the debt
restructuring negotiations and will provide adequate financing assurances.
Fiscal Structural Reforms
25.
The third pillar of the fiscal programme will focus on structural fiscal reforms to
ensure fiscal discipline going forward. They will be aimed at imposing meaningful constraints
on the conduct of fiscal policies and providing a fiscal anchor to guide policy decisions. Reforms
will focus on strengthening five areas: (i) the fiscal policy framework, through the introduction of
a rule-based framework and stronger fiscal risk management; (ii) public financial management;
(iii) improved management of parastatal entities; (iv) pension reform; and (v) debt management:


Fiscal policy framework. The Government intends to transition to a rule-based fiscal
framework that will provide guidance on how fiscal policies would be steered to the
medium-term debt target, as well as after its achievement:
o

The rules will cap real spending growth at trend GDP growth (2-2½ percent), while
allowing revenues to absorb cyclical fluctuations; this will ensure that―once the
desired fiscal target is achieved―it is broadly maintained over the cycle. The fiscal
framework will require a decision on the fiscal balance that will be maintained over
the medium-term after the programme, consistent with the achievement of the
desired debt objectives.

o

The rules will also set caps on personnel spending as a share of tax revenues to
ensure the sustainability of the wage outlays; these caps will be consistent with the
program targets and will be detailed during the first review, following related
technical assistance.



The fiscal policy framework will also be amended to improve the analysis and management
of fiscal risks through: (i) strengthening control over the finances of the rest of the public
sector; (ii) widening the scope of public financial management legislation to the general
government and producing consolidated public sector accounts; and (iii) strengthening
capacity to monitor fiscal risks by creating a Public Investment Unit to monitor and manage
risks associated with parastatal entities, PPPs, and other risks. The introduction of umbrella
legislation for the fiscal framework in line with these reforms will be a structural benchmark
for end-December 2014. To implement this framework, the Government will approve relevant
regulations by end-June 2015.



Public financial management (PFM) legislation. To strengthen the budget process,
financial discipline, and accountability, the Government will revise the public financial
management legislation to: (i) limit the use of executive orders to spend above budget; (ii)
require all spending in excess of the originally approved budget for the fiscal year to be
appropriated by parliament ex ante through a supplementary budget; (iii) introduce

88

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

GRENADA

meaningful contingency funds and contingency appropriations within the budget; (iv)
strengthen control over expenditure commitments, including through the introduction of
strict personal and institutional penalties; and (v) prohibit implementation of changes to the
tax system without parliamentary approval. The revised legislation will also strengthen the
capital budgeting process, including through institutional reforms, value-for-money and
sustainability criteria in the selection of investment projects, move to multiyear budgeting
process and the development of a medium-term strategy plan that will help prioritize
government investment projects and guide the multiyear budgeting process. The
Government is receiving IMF technical assistance on the revision of the PFM legislation, and
intends to obtain parliamentary approval of the revised legislation by end-August 2014
(structural benchmark), with relevant regulations to be approved by end-March 2015. In
addition, to identify other reform priorities across the spectrum of PFM functions, the
authorities have requested the IMF to carry out a Public Expenditure and Financial
Accountability (PEFA) assessment during the coming 12 to 18 months.


Statutory Bodies. Improving the financial performance of the statutory bodies will be an
integral part of reforms to secure lasting fiscal discipline, as they represent an important
source of contingent liabilities for the Government. After initial diagnosis of the financial
situation in the statutory bodies undertaken with technical assistance from CARTAC, the
Government will undertake a strategic review of the functions and the rationale of the
existing statutory bodies, as well as new statutory bodies being considered (the Printery, the
Government Information Service, and Statistics Grenada), and develop a strategic plan for the
sector. The plan will: (i) provide up-to-date information on the financial viability of each
statutory body, including the sustainability of any long-term pension arrangements; (ii)
classify each as being in line for liquidation, privatization, or retention, and provide a time
schedule for such action; and (iii) lay out concrete plans to restructure financially weak
statutory bodies that have been retained. We will receive technical assistance for this review
from CARTAC and the approval of the strategic plan by the Cabinet will be a structural
benchmark for end-October 2014. Financial control over the statutory bodies, including
strengthened reporting requirements and a unit to monitor their performance, will be dealt
with in the context of the revised PFM legislation.



Public sector modernization. In addition to the planned reduction in public sector
employment through attrition, the Government will undertake a strategic review of the public
sector with a view to ultimately reducing the size of the public sector and making it more
efficient. This review will include government functions, public hiring (with a particular
attention on refocusing the Department of Public Administration and reforming the Public
Service Commission), as well as that of civil service size, composition and remuneration
structure. We will seek assistance from our international partners in undertaking such a
review, and will develop a strategic action plan on its basis by end-March 2015, conditional
on availability of technical assistance resources. Parliamentary approval of revised legislation

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

89

GRENADA

on government functions, civil service, and public compensation (including the 1969 Public
Service Law) is expected within the subsequent six months.


Tax incentive regime. The Government plans to overhaul its process for granting tax
incentives in order to prevent the erosion of the tax base and maximize the economic impact
of incentives granted. The reforms will aim at revising the relevant legislation to require that
all new tax exemptions are codified in legislation, no discretionary exemptions are permitted,
and that the beneficiaries of all exemptions file appropriate tax returns and are tax compliant
(structural benchmark for end-November 2014); technical assistance for these reforms was
provided by the IMF in February 2014 and further assistance will be received in July 2014.
Information on the amount of revenue foregone under all tax exemptions will be published
annually in the budget presentation to parliament, and reviews of the rationale, cost, and
benefits of the existing tax exemptions will be conducted periodically.



Pension reform. The Government intends to reform the current public pension system with
a view to consolidating the two different schemes, ensuring more equitable outcomes
among different types of beneficiaries, and providing a competitive return to allow the public
sector to retain qualify staff. The Government has already formed a working group on
pension reform and will also seek technical assistance from CARTAC to assess the fiscal
implications of the various pension reform proposals. The Government aims at submitting
reform legislation to parliament by March 2016.



Treasury Single Account. To ensure an adequate management of its financial resources and
save on interest costs, the Government will aim to transition to an effective treasury single
account. We are receiving technical assistance from CARTAC to undertake an assessment of
the cost effectiveness of the Government’s banking arrangements, facilitate a full audit of the
bank accounts, and to develop a strategy for closing bank accounts and moving to a treasury
single account (either within the commercial banking system or at the ECCB). We will seek
cabinet approval of the strategy by end-July 2014 and aim to fully implement it by endOctober 2014.



Strengthening debt management will also be important in managing and monitoring
portfolio risks, as well as in ensuring that future financing needs are met at reasonable cost.
The Government will seek technical assistance on strengthening debt management, including
on guarantee fees, from the IMF and the World Bank.



Strengthening public procurement. The Government will also seek parliamentary approval
by end-June 2014 for revised public procurement legislation, aimed at making public
procurement more efficient and more transparent.



Governance of the National Transformation Fund (NTF). The Government will ensure a
strong and transparent governance of the NTF that will manage the receipts of the recently
legislated citizenship-by-investment (CBI) programme. Starting from 2014, the accounts of

90

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

GRENADA

the NTF will be audited annually by the Director of Audit. The audit report will be submitted
to the parliament and will be accessible to the public. To avoid abuse of the programme and
ensure its sustainability, the Government will take steps to ensure that: (i) applications are
subject to adequate criminal background checks; and (ii) appropriate AML/CFT measures and
oversight are targeted to the new citizens.

C. Financial Sector Policies
26.
The Government will take a proactive approach to ensuring the continued stability
of the financial system and will support ongoing regional efforts to strengthen financial
regulation and supervision. It will focus on assessing the impact of the debt restructuring on
the financial sector capitalization needs and on strengthening the nonbanking sector regulatory
frameworks and financial position, in keeping with points 6-8 of the ECCU’s eight-point
stabilization and growth program:


The Government will work with the ECCB to gauge—through stress tests—the potential
impact of the debt restructuring on income and capitalization of financial institutions. We
will also assess the potential impact of the debt restructuring on the long run solvency of
the NIS.



The Government has been at the forefront of regional efforts to revamp insurance
regulation and supervision, and has worked proactively to identify and address weaknesses
in the non-bank sector. The Government will continue to promote the consolidation of the
credit union sector as a means of strengthening the financial safety net, will support the
establishment of the proposed Eastern Caribbean Financial Services Regulatory
Commission, and will enact the new uniform ECCU Credit Union Regulations currently
being finalized. To further strengthen the regulatory framework for the credit unions, we
intend to enhance the supervisor’s toolkit by developing, in consultation with the ECCB,
options for providing liquidity support to solvent institutions; strengthening the
requirements for retaining profits in the context of the new regional regulations; and
requiring credit unions to increase capital to assure adequate capitalization over the next
three years, based on the stress tests for the debt exchange impact. We will also complete,
by end-2014, the move to a full risk-based supervision model for credit unions which was
started in 2013.



In the banking sector, the Government will support regional efforts to strengthen banking
regulation and supervision to bolster the ECCB’s resolution powers and strengthen the loan
classification and provisioning requirements. The authorities will commit to promptly
present to Parliament the revised Banking Act and the ECCB agreement once these are
approved by the Monetary Council. The Government will also reach understandings with
the ECCB on strengthening the financial position of the commercial banks in Grenada,
which would include: (i) requirements for retaining profits until the capital and liquidity
position of banks meets prudential requirements; (ii) undertaking a comprehensive and
independent valuation of the assets of the weak banks before end-December 2014, subject

to the loan classification and provisioning requirements to be agreed with the IMF staff
and the World Bank, unless such a valuation had already been initiated in the context of
the regional efforts before end-September; and (iii) based on the findings of the valuation,
the government will discuss with the ECCB how to address its results within recapitalization
or resolution plans.

D. Program Issues
27.
Program monitoring. The programme will be subject to semiannual reviews and
semiannual performance criteria, indicative targets and structural benchmarks, as set out in
Tables 1-2 and in the attached Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU). In addition to
the quantitative targets set therein, a quantitative performance criterion on the wage bill for the
period 2015-16 will be set in line with the programmed levels, if the wage objectives for this
period are not safeguarded through agreement with the trade unions or the fiscal responsibility
legislation before end-2014. We anticipate that the first two reviews would take place September
30, 2014 and March 31, 2015, and will require observance of the continuous performance criteria
and of the conditionality for end-June 2014 and end-December 2014, respectively. To facilitate
program monitoring, we are committed to providing detailed statistical information as specified
in the TMU. Progress in the implementation of the policies under the programme will also be
monitored on a quarterly basis through staff visits.
28.
Safeguards. We will adhere to the safeguards policy in case of Fund budget financing. In
accordance with the recommendations of the 2012 safeguards assessment of the ECCB, we will
maintain our foreign exchange balances only with the ECCB.
29.
Publication. The government authorizes the IMF to publish the Letter of Intent, its
attachments, and the related staff report.

Attachment II. Technical Memorandum of Understanding
1.
Grenada’s performance under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF arrangement), described
in the above Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies, will be assessed on the basis of
observance of quantitative performance criteria, indicative targets, as well as compliance with
structural benchmarks. This Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU) defines the
performance criteria and indicative targets for the arrangement under the ECF. It also describes
the modalities for assessing performance under the programme and the information
requirements for monitoring this performance.
Definitions. For the purpose of the program, central government will cover all items included in
the government budget. The definition of debt is set out in the Guidelines on Performance
Criteria with Respect to External Debt in Fund Arrangement Executive Board Decision No. 6230(79/140), as subsequently amended. External debt is defined as central government contracted or
guaranteed debt owed to creditors residing outside of Grenada, while domestic debt covers
central government contracted or guaranteed debt owed to residents of Grenada. For ease of
monitoring, all securities issued at the Regional Government Securities Market (RGSM) will be
regarded as domestic debt.
I. PERFORMANCE CRITERIA

A. Cumulative Floor on the Central Government Primary Balance
2.
The central government primary balance will be measured from above the line, as: (a)
total revenue and grants of the central government, less (b) total non-interest expenditure of the
central government:


Total revenues and grants will record project grants only to the extent that they have
been spent.



Expenditures will be recorded on an accrual basis, with: (a) budget execution data as
reported by the Ministry of Finance (MOF); supplemented by (b) data on unprocessed
claims to be collected and reported by the MOF.

3.
The central government primary balance will also be monitored from below the line, as
the negative sum of:
i.

Net domestic bank financing, which will be measured by the change in the domestic
banking system credit to the central government minus government deposits in the
banking system, as reported in the monetary survey. Domestic banking system credit to
the central government is defined as the sum of ECCB and commercial banks’ financing
to the central government.
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

95

GRENADA

ii.

Net nonbank financing, which will be measured by the: (a) net changes in holdings of
government securities by nonbanks; and (b) net borrowing from nonbank institutions.
Items (a) and (b) will be reported by the MOF and GARFIN respectively.

iii.

Net government issuance of securities in the Regional Government Securities Market
(RGSM) excluding holdings by the domestic banking and nonbanking system as captured
in point (i) and (ii) above.

iv.

Net external financing of the central government, defined as the sum of: (a) net
disbursements of project and non-project loans, including securitization; (b) net proceeds
from issuance of external debt; and (c) reduction in cash deposits held outside the
domestic financial system. The data will be reported by the MOF on a monthly basis.

v.

The change in the stock of arrears of the central government, measured as the net change
in (a) unpaid checks issued, (b) unprocessed claims, (c) pending invoices, (d) interest
payments past due, and (e) other forms of expenditures recorded above the line but not
paid, such as contributions to the National Insurance Scheme (NIS). The data will be
reported by Ministry of Finance on a monthly basis.

vi.

Gross receipts from divestment, defined as proceeds received from any
privatization/divestment and sale of assets; and

vii.

Any exceptional financing (including rescheduled principal and interest).

viii.

Less domestic and external interest payments on a due basis.

ix.

Less grants received but unutilized.

If the difference between the primary balance measured from above the line and from below the
line is larger than EC$10 million in 2014, EC$6 million in 2015 and EC$3 million in 2016 the MOF
will consult with IMF staff.
4.

The floor on the central government primary balance will be adjusted as follows:
i.

Downward (larger deficit)/upward (smaller deficit) by the amount of retroactive wage and
pension payments for the 2009-2012 period in excess/shortfall relative to the
programmed amounts, as detailed in the table below, with cumulative payment during
the programme period not exceeding EC$26.5 million.

iii.

In the event that revenues (excluding the fees from the CBI programme) and budgetary
grants (grant receipts that are not earmarked for capital outlays) exceed those projected
under the programme, the primary balance target will be adjusted upward by one half of
the excess during January-June, to allow for additional capital spending while
safeguarding compliance with the annual fiscal targets. The following table shows the
accumulated projected revenue and budgetary grants for 2014, as well as capital
spending, to which the actual outcomes will be compared.

Upward for any shortfall in the targeted cash transfers (SEED) from their indicative target.

5.
The authorities will consult with IMF staff on corrective measures in the event of shortfalls
in government revenue and financing. In addition, any funds from the recently legislated
citizenship-by-investment programme received by the National Transformation Fund will be
saved for contingency financing until a sufficient cushion is built, with the future use of the funds
to be addressed during subsequent programme reviews.
6.
To operationalize the contingency measures for 2014, the authorities will reduce budget
allocations to ministries, relative to the program’s primary spending targets, by EC$9.3 million for
the first and second quarter combined, and EC$14 million for the first, second and third quarter
combined, with the withheld allocations being released in the fourth quarter if the programme
targets are on track.

B. Cumulative Ceiling on Central Government Primary Spending
7.
The primary spending of the central government will be calculated as the sum of
revenues and grants that have been utilized minus the primary balance of the central
government as measured above in section A. The performance criterion on primary spending will
be subject to the same adjustors as applied to the primary balance target as applicable. An
additional adjustor would apply to the primary spending target to allow for the full use of
available capital grants: the target will be adjusted upward by the full amount of additional
capital grants received and spent in excess of programmed levels and will be adjusted downward
by half of the shortfall in capital grants compared to the programmed levels to safeguard the
fiscal targets (table above).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

97

GRENADA

C. Ceiling on the Stock of Central Government Domestic Arrears
8.
Domestic arrears are defined as the sum of: (i) any invoice that has been received by a
spending agency from a supplier of goods, services, and capital goods delivered and verified,
and for which payment has not been made within the contractual agreed period, or in the
absence of a grace period, within 60 days; (ii) unpaid wages, pensions, or transfers (excluding
membership fees to regional and international organizations), pending for longer than 60 days
to domestic or foreign residents, irrespective of the currency denomination of the liability; and
(iii) pending interest and amortization payments on domestic debt beyond the grace period set
in the respective loan or debt contracts. Arrears resulting from the nonpayment of debt service
for which a clearance framework has been agreed or a rescheduling agreement is being sought
are excluded from this definition. The data will be reported by the Accountant General’s office.

D. Non-Accumulation of External Debt Arrears (Continuous)
9.
The central government will not incur new arrears in the payment of their external
obligations (contracted or guaranteed) at any time during the programme. Arrears are defined as
a delay in the payment of contractual obligations beyond the grace period set in the respective
loan or debt contracts. Arrears resulting from the nonpayment of debt service for which a
clearance framework has been agreed or for which the government is actively and in good faith
pursuing a debt restructuring are excluded from this definition. The performance criterion will be
applied on a continuous basis under the programme.

E. Ceiling on Non-Concessional External Borrowing by the Central
Government (Continuous)
10.
The ceiling on non-concessional borrowing will be applied to the contracting or
guaranteeing by the central government of medium and long-term external debt (maturity
greater than one year). Excluded from the ceiling is borrowing from regional financial
institutions or markets (Caribbean Development Bank and the RGSM). The contracting and
guaranteeing of non-concessional external debt will be monitored and reported to the Fund
staff by the DMU, after reconciliation with the Accountant General’s office, on a monthly basis.
The performance criterion will be applied on a continuous basis under the programme.
11.
A debt is non-concessional if the grant element (in net present value relative to face
value) is less than 35 percent. The discount rate used for this purpose is 5 percent.

98

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

GRENADA

II. INDICATIVE TARGETS

F. Cumulative Ceiling on Net Increase in Debt Contracted or
Guaranteed by the Central Government
12.
Net increase in debt contracted or guaranteed by the central government is defined as
issuance minus repayments of debt contracted or guaranteed by the central government and
approved by Parliament by each relevant date. For the purposes of the programme, such debt
will be considered to have been contracted as of the date when both: (1) an agreement to
provide such a lending facility or guarantee has been concluded and signed; and (2) the
proposed borrowing or guarantee has been approved by Parliament, in the case of external debt.
The ceiling excludes debt instruments to be issued as part of the process of debt restructuring.
13.
In cases where the government facilitates the financing of Public-Private Partnership
(PPP) projects by concessionaires, the debt of the central government will be increased by the
present value (at the inception of the lease) of all lease payments expected to be made during
the period of the agreement excluding those payments that cover the operation, repair or
maintenance of the property.
14.
The ceiling on the debt contracted or guaranteed by the central government will be
adjusted as follows:


Upward by the amount paid by the government to reimburse the policy holders
of the failed regional insurance companies BAICO and CLICO, less the grantfinanced share of these payments.



Upward to a maximum amount of 5 percent of GDP to accommodate PPP related
expenditures.

15.
The data used to monitor debt contracting will be provided by the DMU, after
reconciliation with the Accountant General’s office, on a monthly basis.

G. Floor on the Social Spending by the Central Government
16.
The social spending of the central government will only include the expenditures incurred
by central government towards the SEED programme (support for education empowerment and
development). This will be reported by the Ministry of finance on a quarterly basis.

H. Memorandum Item: Wage Bill Target
17.
The wage bill of the central government will include the expenditures incurred by the
central government towards the payment of wages, salaries and personnel allowances and

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

99

GRENADA

excludes one-off retroactive wage payments. This will be reported by the ministry of finance on a
quarterly basis.

I. Memorandum Item: Public Employment
18.
The public employment of the central government will include the established
(permanent) and unestablished (temporary) workers. This will be reported by the ministry of
finance on a quarterly basis.
III. EXECUTION OF PRIOR ACTION
19.
All the fiscal adjustment measures that need to be approved as part of the prior action

Appendix II. Supplementary Letter of Intent
June 12, 2014
Ms. Christine Lagarde
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431

Dear Ms. Lagarde,
The Government continues to make steady progress with its debt restructuring process.
In early March 2014, the Government and its advisors met in Miami with a committee comprising
holders of a majority of the US dollar bonds due 2025. The discussions centered around the
medium-term macroeconomic framework that lies at the heart of the proposed programme, as
well as on the measures that the Government intends to implement in order to address current
macroeconomic imbalances. The discussions were productive in clarifying aspects of Grenada’s
expected payment capacity during the life of the programme and beyond, and since the Miami
meetings weekly calls have been held with the committee and its advisors to further discuss
technical matters relating to the restructuring.
The Government believes that it has now largely satisfied the committee’s data and information
requests, and has executed a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) with the committee’s advisors to
facilitate the exchange of detailed information. The Government has articulated its debt
reduction objectives to the committee and its advisors, and in turn the committee has indicated
it will soon be in a position to begin discussing the precise terms of the proposed restructuring.
To this effect, it is expected that the committee will shortly execute its own NDA with the
Government.
In parallel, and in response to bondholder requests, the Government has published indicative
restructuring options for its EC dollar bond due 2025, involving face value reductions of 50-60
percent. The feedback received so far by the Government clearly indicates that bondholders – by
and large – understand that Grenada’s projected payment capacity will not permit the
Government to offer softer restructuring terms for its indebtedness. Negotiations over the details
of the restructuring package are continuing with increased momentum, and the government has
already received indications from some creditors that they would accept the 60 percent haircut
option once the offer is formally launched, which we aim to do in the third quarter of 2014.
With regards to the official bilateral debt, the Government has written to the Paris Club in
advance of the formal request for financing assurances, and has indicated that Grenada stands
ready to approach the Club to negotiate the treatment of its arrears and future maturities as
soon as it is invited to do so by the Club following the approval of the proposed programme by
the IMF’s Executive Board.

The Government has also written to its non-Paris Club official bilateral creditors, updating them
on the objectives of the programme and requesting their support through a comprehensive
restructuring of their claims. In the specific case of Taiwan, the Government has submitted a
restructuring proposal closely mirroring the options for the EC dollar bond due 2025, and is
actively discussing the details of the proposed restructuring package with this creditor and its
advisors. Both sides remain focused on reaching an amicable and sustainable agreement outside
legal channels, though for now the legal process is ongoing.
Separately, the Government has embarked on negotiations with its key domestic creditors,
including commercial bank lenders and large holders of Treasury Bills not listed on the Regional
Government Securities Market (RGSM). The Government has communicated its intention to apply
restructuring terms similar to those proposed for the EC dollar bonds due 2025 to all its domestic
obligations other than the overdrafts, RGSM-listed Treasury Bills, and some categories of
domestic arrears.
Overall, this progress demonstrates the government’s commitment to achieving a
comprehensive and collaborative debt restructuring that would help to restore fiscal
sustainability and secure needed financing going forward. It also demonstrates its commitment
to the principles of good faith negotiations with our creditors and equitable treatment among
diverse groups of creditors. We will continue to adhere to these principles to achieve a
satisfactory outcome. With the current progress, the government envisages to make significant
headway in the debt restructuring by end-2014.

Sincerely,

/s/
Hon. Keith Mitchell
Prime Minister, Minister of Finance and Energy

Safeguards Assessment: Under the Fund's safeguards assessment policy, the Eastern
Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB) is subject to a full safeguards assessment on a four year cycle. The
most recent assessment was completed on April 16, 2012 and did not identify any significant
safeguards risks. The assessment made some recommendations to sustain and advance the ECCB's
safeguards framework going forward. The authorities broadly agreed with the recommendations and
have commenced implementation.
Exchange Arrangement: Grenada is a member for the ECCB, which manages monetary
policy and the exchange system for its eight members. The common currency, the Eastern Caribbean
dollar, has been pegged to the U.S. dollar at the rate of EC$2.70 per U.S. dollar since July 1976. In
practice, the ECCB has operated like a quasi-currency board, maintaining foreign exchange backing
of its currency and demand liabilities of close to 100 percent. Grenada accepted the obligations of
Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 in January 1994. It maintains an exchange system free of restrictions
on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions.
Article IV Consultation: Grenada was on the 12-month consultation cycle but a 24-month
consultation cycle is proposed. The last Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive Board
on July 13, 2012 (SM/12/159).
FSAP Participation: Grenada participated in the regional Eastern Caribbean Currency Union
FSAP conducted in September and October 2003. The Financial System Stability Assessment is
IMF Country Report No. 04/293.
Technical Assistance:
Caribbean Regional Technical Assistance Centre (CARTAC)
CARTAC has provided wide-ranging assistance in developing a Medium-Term Macroeconomic
Framework; implementing VAT; assisting customs with ASYCUDA and with the exchange of
information with inland revenue; strengthening customs enforcement and risk management; financial
monitoring of statutory bodies; drafting legislation to establish the single supervisory agency,
Grenada Authority for the Regulation of the Financial Institutions (GARFIN) and supporting the newly

assistance in improving the production and dissemination of macroeconomic statistics, including
national accounts compilation; rebasing of the consumer price index and GDP constant prices series
and developing new consumption price basket; initiating work to prepare export-import price
indices; training in the processing of trade data; and improving external sector statistics as part of a
major CARTAC/ECCB project.
Other Technical Assistance (2007–14)
FAD and LEG have provided extensive assistance in tax policy and administration, public financial
management and on public expenditure rationalization. In particular, technical assistance was

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
(As of March 31, 2014)

The World Bank Group’s Board discussed the Organization of the Eastern Caribbean States (OECS)
Regional Partnership Strategy (RPS) on June 8, 2010. The RPS provides the strategic framework for
assisting the six independent countries of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS)1 for
the period 2010-14. It sets forth the terms of engagement of the International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), the International Development Association (IDA) and the
International Finance Corporation (IFC) with the countries of the Eastern Caribbean, sub-regional
organizations and other development partners in pursuit of the following strategic objectives:
(a) building resilience; and (b) enhancing competitiveness and stimulating growth over the medium
term. On May 15, 2012 the World Bank Group’s Board considered the Progress Report, assessing
implementation of the RPS at mid-term. While the RPS remains relevant, going forward, increasing
vulnerabilities and global economic conditions call for flexibility to permit the Bank to be responsive
to client demands.
Under the current strategy, the Bank’s activities help build resilience and support interventions aimed
at promoting fiscal and debt sustainability, protecting and improving human capital―particularly
social safety nets, education and health―and strengthening disaster risk management and climate
resilience. To help enhance competitiveness and stimulate sustainable growth, the Bank focuses its
support on two critical areas: Strengthening the countries’ domestic financial sectors, and improving
access to quality services to create more competitive business environments.
The ongoing program of support is allowing the OECS to borrow up to US$120 million (up to
US$20 million per country) on IBRD terms and up to SDR 50.3 million (roughly US$75 million) IDA
concessional resources - under the IDA-16 (FY12-14) replenishment - for the six OECS. The specific
IDA-16 (FY12-14) allocation for Grenada has been equal to SDR 11.6 million (roughly US$17 million),
of which the remaining US$10 million are planned to be used by FY14 for a Development Policy
Operation to support the upcoming IMF program. Because of their high level of debt, the OECS have
made full use of the IDA available resources, but borrow little form the IBRD envelope (e.g. Dominica,
St. Kitts and Nevis, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines have not used any IBRD resource during this
period). The IDA-17 (FY15-17) negotiation has been concluded in December 2013; however, the level
of individual national allocation has not yet been disclosed.
The WBG is now in the process to finalize the new OECS Regional Partnership Strategy covering the
period FY15-19, which is expected to be discussed at the Board by FY14. The consultation process,

The OECS was created in 1981 and comprises six independent countries and three British Overseas Territories. This
RPS covers only the six independent countries, namely: Antigua and Barbuda; Dominica; Grenada; St. Kitts and Nevis;
Saint Lucia; and, St. Vincent and the Grenadines. Apart from St. Vincent and the Grenadines, which has not yet joined
the IFC, all are members of the World Bank Group. Antigua and Barbuda and St. Kitts and Nevis are the only OECS
countries to be eligible to IBRD resources, due to their high-income status.

with Governments, multilateral and bilateral partners, and other stakeholders, including
representatives of the private sector and Civil Society Organizations (CSO), has been very extensive
and involved the six OECS Governments and the relevant regional institutions, such as the Eastern
Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB) and the OECS Secretariat. The overall high-level objective of the new
regional strategy will be to help the countries to lay the foundations for sustainable inclusive growth.
In particular, the two main pillars will be: (i) revitalizing sources of growth; and (ii) building resilience.
Under this framework, the WBG will be very selective in identifying focus areas and addressing
clients’ needs, in line with its twin corporate goals of eliminating extreme poverty and boosting
shared prosperity.

A. Projects
There are five active World Bank projects in Grenada for a net commitment of approximately
US$28.4 million of which US$8.2 million has been disbursed.
The OECS E-Government for Regional Integration Program was approved by the Board on
May 2008. This project consists of a US$2.4 million IDA Credit to Grenada and is designed to
promote the efficiency, quality, and transparency of public services through the delivery of
regionally integrated e-government applications that take advantage of economies of scale. The
program is structured in phases. Phase 1 focuses on cross-sectoral e-government issues, as well as
on specific applications in the public finance area (including Public Financial Management or PFM,
tax, customs and procurement), and also includes an e-government in health pilot project (possibly
together with preparatory and complementary activities in other social and productive sectors).
Subsequent phases of the program are expected to deepen the assistance provided under Phase 1,
while expanding the program to cover other sectors, in particular, education, agriculture, tourism,
postal, among others that may emerge during the early stages of implementation of Phase 1.
The Eastern Caribbean Energy Regulatory Authority (ECERA) Project was approved in June 2011
for US$2.8 million. It aims to establish and operationalize a regional approach to the development of
the electricity sector in participating countries by supporting the establishment of the ECERA. The
project has two components. Component A will facilitate the creation and launching of the ECERA,
including carrying out the legal and consultative process leading to the formulation and ratification
of the ECERA treaty, and defining the options for the ECERA self-financing mechanism, reviewing
tariffs and examining incentive mechanisms to promote renewable energy. Component B will
facilitate the initial three years of ECERA’s operations, including the day-to-day operations and
execution of core regulatory tasks including: (i) tariff and investment plan reviews; and (ii) defining a
regional licensing framework for electricity market participants with a particular focus on facilitating
the integration of electricity production from renewable sources into the supply mix.
The OECS Disaster Vulnerability Reduction Project was approved in June 2011. Grenada will
receive a total of US$26.2 million, including a US$10 million zero-interest credit from IDA repayable
in 35 years with a 10-year grace period; a US$8 million grant from the Caribbean Regional Pilot
Program for Climate Resilience (PPCR); and an US$8.2 million zero-interest loan from PPCR

6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

GRENADA

repayable in 40 years with a 10-year grace period. The project aims to create understanding of the
vulnerability of key structures and increase resilience of critical public infrastructure, which will
complement the work and goals of the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience. Component 1 will
implement a broad spectrum of interventions aimed at building resilience in public buildings and
infrastructure. Component 2 will support regional efforts in the Eastern Caribbean to build capacity
to conduct assessment of natural risks and integrate such knowledge into policy- and decisionmaking for development investments, disaster risk mitigation, climate change adaptation, and
disaster response planning across sectors. Component 3 will re-categorize financing or provide
additional financing to cover early recovery and rehabilitation costs following an adverse natural
event, and subject to a Government’s declaration of emergency in accordance with national law and
the submission of a recovery action plan satisfactory to the Association. Component 4 will
strengthen and develop the institutional capacity for project management and implementation.
The Grenada Safety Net Advancement Project was approved in June 2011 for US$5 million. The
project aims to (i) strengthen the basic architecture of the consolidated Conditional Cash Transfer
(CCT) Program and the capacity of the Ministry of Social Development to implement it; (ii) improve
coverage of poor households receiving cash transfers; and (iii) improve education outcomes of poor
children and health monitoring of vulnerable households. Component 1 will finance cash transfers to
beneficiaries. Disbursements will be made against meeting performance milestones aimed at the
gradual adoption of an overhauled business model in results areas including institutions; budget
and coverage; beneficiary outreach and targeting; management information systems and making
payments against co-responsibilities; communication; and monitoring and evaluation. Component 2
will provide technical assistance to the Ministry of Social Development (MOSD) for improving its
management, coordination, supervision, monitoring, and evaluation of the newly consolidated
conditional cash transfer (CCT) program, including the design of a PMT, a MIS, and an impact
evaluation.
The Caribbean Regional Communications Infrastructure Program was approved in May 2012.
The program aims to increase access to regional broadband networks and advance the
development of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) enabled services industry in the
Caribbean Region. The project has four components.
1. Regional connectivity infrastructure component will address the: (i) physical connectivity
infrastructure including submarine cable infrastructure, terrestrial broadband backbone fiber
networks and terrestrial or submarine cross-border links, leveraging government networks
as needed, and national and regional Internet Exchange Points (IXPs), and (ii) enabling
environment that would ensure Public Private Partnership in the ownership, management
and competitive access to the infrastructure.
2. ICT-led innovation component will support activities that will leverage the regional
broadband infrastructure to foster growth of the regional IT/IT Enabled Services (ITES)
industry.
3. Implementation support component will support implementation, institutional and capacity
building as well as monitoring and evaluation.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

GRENADA

4. A fourth component is included in the overall program design. This component will be
aimed at improving government and private sector efficiency and transparency by
leveraging the regional broadband infrastructure towards the delivery of a wide variety of eservices.

B. Non-Lending Activities
Caribbean Growth Forum (CGF). On December 11, 2012, the Government of Grenada launched the
national chapter of the Caribbean Growth Forum (CGF). The CGF is an initiative led by the World
Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, and the Caribbean Development Bank, in collaboration
with the United Kingdom Agency for International Development (DFID) and the Canadian
International Development Agency (CIDA), to identify policies and initiatives aimed at inducing
growth and creating jobs in the Caribbean region through analytical work, knowledge exchange and
inclusive dialogue. The CGF can contribute to an enhanced and participatory policy dialogue
(involving private sector, CSOs, and other non-traditional stakeholders, such as youth and Diaspora)
on key challenges that affect economic growth, in a situation where fiscal space is limited and the
need to promote a more diversified knowledge-based economy is pressing. The CGF national
chapters have already been launched in 12 Caribbean countries, including all the six OECS countries.
During the CGF process in Grenada, participants discussed issues and measures to strengthen the
investment climate, logistics and connectivity, and skills and productivity. Key actions addressed
under the initiatives are summarized at the end of this brief.
Economic and Sector Work. Grenada benefits from a comprehensive series of completed, ongoing
and planned analytical and advisory activities to support the RPS’ two main pillars including:
“Towards a New Agenda for Growth” – OECS growth and competitiveness study (2005); a OECS
Skills Enhancement Policy Note (2006); a Caribbean Air Transport Report (2006); a regional study on
Crime, Violence, and Development: Trends, Costs, and Policy Options in the Caribbean (2007); an
OECS Private Sector Financing Study (2008); the OECS Tourism Backward Linkages Study (2008); the
report titled “Caribbean – Accelerating Trade Integration: Policy Options for Sustained Growth, Job
Creation and Poverty Reduction” (2009); a study on the Nurse Labor & Education Markets in the
English-Speaking CARICOM: Issues and Options for Reform (2009); Caribbean Regional Electricity
Supply Options: Toward Greater Security, Renewable and Resilience (2011); and “The Growing
Burden of Non-Communicable Diseases in the Eastern Caribbean” (2011).

RELATIONS WITH THE CARIBBEAN DEVELOPMENT
BANK
(As of March 1, 2014)
Since the commencement of operations, the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) has approved
US$176.8 million (net) in loans, contingent loans, equity and grants to the Government of Grenada;
representing 6.6% of total approvals to CDB’s borrowing member countries. CDB’s lending has
mainly been in the area of social and economic infrastructure, aimed at improving the country’s
growth potential in order to reduce poverty.
CDB is currently developing a new framework of assistance to Grenada for the period 2014–18,
largely based on a number of key development challenges facing the country. Among the
challenges identified were: (a) fiscal and debt sustainability; (b) low productivity and
competitiveness; (c) the need to increase social inclusion and enhance citizen security; (d) high
economic, social and environmental vulnerability; and (e) the need to boost growth and
competitiveness of the private sector, especially micro, small and medium-sized enterprises; (f) the
need to strengthen resilience to climate change and disaster risk management; and (g) improving
quality/access to education and training.
CDB’s strategy will support the critical priorities identified by the Government of Grenada as it seeks
to accelerated growth, create jobs, and achieve fiscal and debt sustainability. Some of the outcomes
being pursued in the current strategy result from the continuation of programs which started during
implementation of the previous strategy. The priority sector outcomes are:
(i)

Improved macroeconomic management. In an environment of macroeconomic instability
and low growth, a Policy-Based Loan (PBL) of US$30 million in budget support has been
requested by Government to help restore macroeconomic stability and continue its policy
reform agenda.

(ii)

Increased access to high quality education and training. Continued support for the
education sector development strategy with components relating to: ongoing restoration of
school infrastructure; a heightened focus on quality and relevance to improve student
outcomes; alignment of education and training with the needs of the economy; policy
development; and strengthening strategic leadership and planning capacity.

(iii)

Improved access by the poor to basic infrastructure and services through communitydriven development. The Basic Needs Trust Fund (BNTF) Seventh program will be providing
community-driven grant resources for education and human resource development, water
and sanitation, and community infrastructure.

(iv)

Enhanced social policy/social protection and research. The Bank recently assisted with
the development of a Gender Policy and will seek to facilitate its implementation.
Additionally, the Bank will assist in the conduct of a new poverty assessment to help the
Government in poverty monitoring and evidence-based decision-making.

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

GRENADA

(v)

Improved environmental sustainability and land use management. In light of the
challenges of environmental degradation and the need to build a sustainable solid waste
system, the Bank has identified interventions to assist in the development of a land use
policy; help implement adaptation measures for select communities affected by climate
change; and assist in the development of environmentally sound solid waste options.

(vi)

Enhanced energy efficiency and renewable energy development. CDB will help remove
the binding constraints to the achievement of policy targets with respect to energy efficiency
and the development of renewable energy options.

(vii)

Improved economic infrastructure. CDB will assist in financing outstanding work that
contributes to the redevelopment of the town of Grenville through improvements in key
urban infrastructure. Three of four sub-components are already complete.

Major projects under implementation include:
1.

Grenville Market Square Development—this project was designed to address issues of
poor quality infrastructure in the market square, unhygienic practices in relation to the
slaughter of animals and issues of vehicular and pedestrian congestion as a result of a bus
terminal within the environs of the market.

2.

Schools Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Project II—the major issues addressed by this
project are the inadequacy of the physical learning environment, the need for curricula
refocusing and the enhancement of instructional modalities in the school system.

3.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of May 31, 2014)
I.

Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance

General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance.
National Accounts: A rebased GDP series (using 2006 as the base year) was released in October
2010 with assistance from CARTAC. The new series improved coverage, data sources, and
methodology. Administrative data from revenue agencies are used to supplement the coverage of
survey-based results for industries such as hotels and restaurants, manufacturing, and wholesale and
retail trade. Education, health and social work are now identified as separate industries, and public
components of these services, formerly included under government, have now been reclassified.
However, some weakness remain; data on GDP broken down by expenditure is not available at
constant prices, while data at current prices is not reliable due to weaknesses in estimating gross
capital formation. Private final consumption expenditure is estimated as a residual.
Prices and high frequency statistics: The authorities provide regular data on consumer prices,
retail sales, imports of construction material, water and electricity production. The 2010 revisions of
the CPI series assured that the new series met international standards. A new CPI basket, including
several additional items, has been developed using data from the 2007/08 Household Income and
Expenditure Survey (HIES), with a strong recommendation to conduct the HIES on a five-year cycle
to ensure more timely future updates than the current ten-year period. The new series are rereferenced to January 2010 and historical CPI series back to 2001 have been recalculated based on
the new structure. Producer prices, export and import price indices are not available.
Labor statistics: Labor statistics are scarce. A Labor Force Survey was completed recently in 2013
and a population census was completed in 2011. Regular wage and unemployment data are not
available with the exception of partial data available from the National Insurance Scheme. The
Central Statistical Office (CSO) conducted a Country Poverty Assessment in 2008, with assistance of
the Caribbean Development Bank, and is working with the International Labor Organization (ILO) to
improve the coverage of labor market statistics.
Government finance statistics: The reporting of central government data has improved in recent
years, with monthly data being provided to the ECCB, IMF, and other users in Fund economic
classification format with lags of about 4–6 weeks. However, some challenges remain with the
accuracy and timeliness of the capital expenditure data: (i) the composition of public expenditure
appears to be inaccurate as many current spending items are classified as capital spending; and (ii)
donor-financed capital spending data are often not available until the end of the year, as they are
not reported to or do not pass through the accounts of the central government. The coverage of the

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

GRENADA

rest of the public sector is limited, and there are no consolidated public sector accounts. Financial
information on selected public enterprises is available, but is not reported to the Ministry of Finance,
although the new Public Finance Management Act of 2007 requires public enterprises to submit
audited financial statements within four months after the close of the financial year.
Monetary statistics: Monetary data are compiled by the ECCB on a monthly basis and reported
regularly to the Fund, and is broadly adequate for surveillance.
Balance of payments: The ECCB compiles balance of payments statistics on an annual basis, using
information collected by the CSO. The data are reported to the IMF for publication in the IFS and
Balance of Payments Yearbook. The statistics are based primarily on information collected from
surveys of establishments; however, these surveys are not comprehensive and the response rates are
usually poor. Merchandise trade statistics have traditionally been more reliable and are available by
SITC classification on a quarterly basis. The reliability and comprehensiveness of the merchandise
trade statistics have suffered considerably in the aftermath of Hurricane Ivan (September 2004) and
reporting is mostly fully back on track. Enhanced data sources and better compilation procedures
are needed to improve the accuracy of the balance of payments statistics, especially with regard to
remittances, tourism spending and FDI. Moreover, efforts should be undertaken to compile quarterly
balance of payments statistics and the annual international investment position statement.
External and domestic debt statistics: The database for central government external debt is
comprehensive, and can be used to provide detailed and reasonably up-to-date breakdowns of
disbursements and debt service, including future projections. There is also a detailed database on
domestic government securities maintained by the Regional Governments Securities Market (RGSM)
that provides data on auction results, and outstanding securities of the central government.
Although the stock information on privately placed domestic T-bills, loans, bonds, and overdraft
facilities are available on a monthly basis, there is no reliable data on future projections. Data
availability on government-guaranteed debt and debt of public enterprises is limited, and there is
no data on private external debt.
II.

Data Standards and Quality

While Grenada has participated in the Fund’s General Data Dissemination System since March 2001,
most of the metadata have not been updated since late 2002.
III.

Reporting to STA

The International Financial Statistics page includes data on exchange rates, international liquidity,
monetary statistics, prices, balance of payments, national accounts, and population. The authorities
do not report fiscal data for publication in IFS. The ECCB provides data to the IMF for publication in
the Balance of Payments Yearbook. Grenada has not provided any fiscal data, either on a GFSM
2001 basis, or a cash basis, for presentation in the GFS Yearbook. The ECCB disseminates Grenada’s
quarterly GFS data in its Economic and Financial Review.

Press Release No. 14/310
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
June 26, 2014

International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Approves 3-Year US$21.7 Million Extended Credit Facility
Arrangement for Grenada and Concludes 2014 Article IV Consultation
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today approved a three-year
SDR 14.04 million (about US$21.7 million, 120 percent of quota) arrangement under the
Extended Credit Facility (ECF) for Grenada and concluded the 2014 Article IV consultation.1
The approval enables the immediate disbursement of an amount equivalent to SDR 2.04
million (about US$3.2 million).
The main objectives of the authorities’ ECF-supported economic program are to improve
competitiveness and medium-term growth prospects, restore fiscal and debt sustainability
and strengthen financial stability. Reforms to raise Grenada’s growth prospects will focus on
improving price competitiveness and the business environment. To put public debt on a firm
downward path, a comprehensive strategy consisting of fiscal consolidation, debt
restructuring and fiscal structural reforms is being implemented. Planned reforms to the
financial sector will ensure the system’s solvency and strengthen regulation and supervision.
The authorities’ program also envisions an increase in spending on social support programs,
supported by minimum spending levels to protect those most vulnerable to the changes.
Following the Executive Board’s discussion on Grenada, Mr. David Lipton, Deputy
Managing Director and Acting Chair, made the following statement:
“Grenada has made important progress in addressing its fiscal crisis, following a protracted
economic recession and a difficult social environment. The authorities have taken wideranging measures to reduce the fiscal deficit and are negotiating in good faith with creditors
to restructure the public debt. The challenges ahead remain significant, with a vulnerable
growth outlook, high debt levels and financing needs, and a weakened financial system.
“The authorities’ ambitious economic program, supported by the Fund, focuses on restoring
fiscal sustainability as an immediate priority, strengthening competitiveness and growth
prospects, and securing financial stability. The success of the program hinges critically on
1

1 Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a
report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

2

full implementation of the reforms by the authorities, broad social support, and assistance
from Grenada’s development partners.
“A significant fiscal adjustment is needed to strengthen confidence and put public
indebtedness on a sustainable path. Achieving the targeted primary surplus requires a
carefully calibrated combination of revenue increases and expenditure cuts. The authorities
are committed to strengthening revenue mobilization and enhancing the social safety net to
protect the most vulnerable.
“Consolidation efforts to reduce public debt to sustainable levels need to be complemented
by a comprehensive debt restructuring. Upgrading the institutional framework for fiscal
policy will be important to lock in the gains from these combined efforts.
“Improving Grenada’s competitiveness and the employment outlook is key to growth and
prosperity. Structural reforms focus on improving the business environment, reducing
electricity costs, and removing other obstacles to growth.
“The authorities are committed to participating in the comprehensive regional strategy to
strengthen the financial system, coordinated by the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank.
Accelerated efforts are necessary to ensure that banks can provide credit needed for the
Grenadian economy.”
The Executive Board also completed the 2014 Article IV consultation with Grenada.
Grenada’s economy continues to face significant headwinds after a decade of natural
disasters and economic shocks coalesced into a deep economic crisis by 2011-12. Economic
activity declined by over 8 percent of GDP from peak to trough (2008-12) as tourism and
construction collapsed. After almost four years of decline, real GDP grew by 1.5 percent in
2013. Economic slack and tight monetary conditions have driven the economy into
deflationary territory, with the consumer price index (CPI) declining by 1.2 percent in 2013.
The current account deficit widened to 27.1 percent of GDP in 2013 from 19.2 percent in
2012 due to a sharp increase in imports related to a resort construction project.
The economic recovery continues to be held back by a deep fiscal crisis and weak financial
balance sheets. Public debt reached about 110 percent of GDP at end-2013, in part reflecting
attempts to run countercyclical fiscal policies since the outset of the global crisis. The weak
fiscal position stoked financing pressures and, unable to secure financing, the government
announced on March 8, 2013 that it would undertake a “comprehensive and collaborative”
restructuring of its public debt. Financial sector balance sheets have also been increasingly
strained by impaired assets, curtailing the supply of credit and slowing the already weak
economic recovery. Private credit declined by 5 percent in 2013.
To address the fiscal crisis, the authorities have initiated fiscal adjustment as part of their
2014 budget, and have subsequently approved a large package of revenue measures needed

3

for the targeted consolidation. Debt restructuring negotiations are currently underway with
many creditor groups, with significant headway in restructuring expected before end-2014.
The pace of economic recovery is expected to be modest over the near term, at about 1½
percent a year during 2014-17, supported in part by an easing of government financing
constraints as the fiscal crisis is gradually resolved. Nevertheless, a faster recovery will likely
be held back by the drag of the fiscal adjustment and the weak credit growth as banks repair
their balance sheets. In line with weak demand, inflation is expected to remain subdued.
Risks to the outlook are high, stemming in particular from faltering confidence if progress is
not made soon in addressing the fiscal crisis, from a continued weak global recovery (on
which Grenada depends for tourism) and from potential natural disasters.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors observed that Grenada’s economic recovery remains fragile and
continues to face serious headwinds, while policy space is limited. Unemployment is
elevated, debt levels are high, and financing needs are large. Directors also noted that weak
competitiveness is hampering growth and the financial sector is burdened by nonperforming
assets.
Against this backdrop and given significant downside risks, Directors underscored the
importance of strong commitment and full implementation of the Fund-supported economic
program, which aims to restore fiscal sustainability, boost competitiveness, jobs and growth,
and strengthen the financial sector. Financial and technical assistance from Grenada’s
development partners, as well as social consensus on reform priorities, is critical to achieving
macroeconomic stability and development goals.
Directors stressed the urgency of placing the public-debt-to-GDP ratio on a firm downward
path toward the regional target, through front-loaded budgetary consolidation, ambitious
fiscal reforms, and a comprehensive debt restructuring. They agreed that the targeted
strengthening of the primary fiscal balance appropriately balances the need to reduce debt
pressures with managing the drag on the economy. Directors welcomed measures recently
taken to reduce the personal income tax threshold and broaden the tax base. They stressed
that further efforts are needed to reduce the public wage bill, curb tax evasion, and strengthen
social safety nets, while protecting growth-enhancing capital investments.
Directors emphasized that a strengthened fiscal framework will be important to sustain
consolidation gains and enhance fiscal discipline. The adoption of fiscal responsibility
legislation will better anchor policy decisions, and promote transparency and accountability.
Directors also highlighted as priority areas reforms to public financial management to
improve overall budgetary control, rationalization of the civil service to increase its
efficiency, improvements to debt management, and tax administration reforms.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views
of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any
qualifiers used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

4

Directors agreed that a lasting solution to the public debt overhang requires a debt
restructuring. They supported the authorities’ comprehensive and collaborative approach, and
welcomed progress in negotiations thus far. Directors urged the authorities to continue to
engage with creditors in good faith and complete the restructuring and regularize arrears to
official creditors in a timely manner.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ active participation in the regional strategy to strengthen
financial stability. They looked forward to the asset quality review of Grenada’s banking
system, supported by proactive resolution and recapitalization plans that would limit
contingent fiscal costs. Directors stressed the need to continue to address weaknesses in the
nonbank sector, including through improvements to the regulatory framework.
Directors supported the structural reform agenda aimed at enhancing competitiveness and the
business climate, which would facilitate internal devaluation. They considered that priority
should be given to reforms to reduce energy costs, streamline tax incentives, and liberalize
key sectors.
