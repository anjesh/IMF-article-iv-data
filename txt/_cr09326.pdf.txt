EXECUTIVE SUMMARY


As Côte d’Ivoire makes progress toward full reunification, peace, and political
normalization, the longer-term outlook is positive. The country has been resilient to
the global economic crisis, and—provided the elections take place soon in a peaceful
environment—growth could firm up considerably. Structural reforms to improve
governance and the business climate will be essential to strengthen competitiveness, raise
investment from low levels, and diversify the economy away from the traditional reliance
on a small number of export products with volatile prices. This is consistent with the
poverty reduction strategy (PRS) adopted in early 2009, and will strengthen
macroeconomic stability and contribute to the external stability of the WAEMU.



Performance on the PRGF-supported program has been satisfactory. Most
quantitative performance criteria (PCs) through June 2009 were met, but waivers are
requested for two small deviations. Fiscal targets were generally met. The authorities
have made significant efforts to pay domestic arrears. Some structural reforms were
implemented, although the general pace has been slow.



The authorities have made significant progress in clearing external arrears. They
have regularized relations with multilateral creditors and obtained a rescheduling
agreement from the Paris Club in May 2009. A preliminary debt restructuring agreement
was reached in September with the coordination committee of Brady bond holders, and
negotiations have begun with other commercial creditors to restructure other external
debt.



The 2010 program continues to follow the program’s medium-term plan. Growth
should rise to 4 percent with further political stabilization and a return in confidence, and
inflation should stay low. This would allow the government to continue its fiscal
discipline and advance the structural reform agenda to build competitiveness and allow a
much-needed improvement in social indicators.



The risks seem manageable. Besides political uncertainties, the risks include overruns
in the electricity subsidy, accumulated unpaid wage commitments, the sizable pension
fund deficit, weaknesses in the financial sector, and a slowdown in structural reforms.
However, with timely implementation of the authorities’ program, these risks should be
manageable.

INTRODUCTION
1.
Even though the situation remains fragile, after its sociopolitical crisis Côte
d’Ivoire is moving toward peace, reunification, and political normalization (MEFP ¶ 1).
It has made significant progress in preparing for presidential elections and finalizing the
electoral list. Voting was scheduled for end-November 2009 but has now been delayed; a
new date is expected to be announced shortly. There has been progress in the administrative
reunification of the country through redeployment of government agencies and staff to the
Center-North-West (CNW) regions, but the disarmament of former combatants has been very
sluggish.
2.
The medium-term framework underlying the PRGF arrangement and
Côte d’Ivoire’s poverty reduction strategy remains valid (MEFP ¶ 6). The economic
recovery is taking hold, and progress has been made in fiscal consolidation, governance, and
some structural reforms, although more needs to be done to invigorate private sector activity.
Côte d’Ivoire has benefited from significant debt relief, and the authorities aim to reduce the
debt stock to sustainable levels at the HIPC completion point.
I. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS—EMERGING FROM SOCIOPOLITICAL CRISIS, THE
ECONOMY STRENGTHENS
3.
The global crisis is having little impact on Côte d’Ivoire as the economy
continues to recover from the protracted internal crisis. Favorable terms of trade since
2007 have supported the recovery of real GDP growth. Growth is projected to accelerate to
3.7 percent in 2009, increasing per capita income for the first time since 1998 (Tables 1–2).
Growth reflects the effect of good rains on agriculture and agroprocessing as well as strong
mining, refining, and chemical industry activity. Yet investment has held at about 10 percent
of GDP, too low to meet the needs of a growing economy.

4.
After a temporary spike in late 2008, inflation has declined to about 3 percent
(MEFP ¶ 6), the target for the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU). At
the end of 2008 inflation reached 9 percent because of high international food and fuel prices.
It has since eased with an ample harvest and lower import prices, and in the year through
August 2009 consumer prices have declined by 1.8 percent. The automatic fuel price
mechanism has been operational since April, and pump prices for fuel are adjusted monthly
to track international market developments.
5.
Monetary policy is conducted at the regional level. During the internal crisis
Côte d’Ivoire’s share in WAEMU financial services declined. The recent Financial Sector
Assessment Program (FSAP) mission pointed to vulnerabilities in the Ivorian financial
system (see section II.C) that mainly involve locally-owned banks. Credit to the private
sector has been expanding strongly since 2006, and double-digit growth is projected for
2009, reflecting large unmet credit demand (Tables 3a–b). Market interest rates in the region
increased in late 2008 as governments issued more paper in the regional market to meet their
financing needs as export-based revenues fell. Since early 2009 interest rates have been
declining as the BCEAO cut its policy rate to limit the regional impact of the global financial
crisis.
6.
The external current account improved in 2008–09 owing to strong cocoa
exports and favorable terms of trade. After a small deficit in 2007 the current account
moved into surplus and is projected to reach 2.7 percent of GDP in 2009, aided by a
30 percent increase in cocoa export prices (Table 4). In a climate of continuing political
uncertainty and weak confidence, the strong current account performance is expected to feed
increased private capital outflows as foreign companies repatriate profits rather than invest
and domestic exporters only partially repatriate their proceeds. Also, Côte d’Ivoire’s share in
the reserves of WAEMU is expected to rise in 2009.
7.
The government has begun to implement its Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS).
The PRS was adopted in February 2009, and in September the government put in place
arrangements to monitor its implementation (MEFP, ¶8–13). It is also formulating matrices
of priority actions and medium-term programs for various ministries—these are most
advanced for the health, education, and judicial systems. The aim is to finalize the costing of
some of these plans by year-end so as to identify external donors and domestic sources of
financing.
II. ECONOMIC CHALLENGES—MOVING FROM RECOVERY TO SUSTAINED ROBUST
GROWTH AND BROADER POVERTY REDUCTION
8.
Policy discussions for the Article IV consultation focused on the challenges of
building growth, reducing poverty, and restoring a sustainable fiscal and external
position. Priorities that emerged confirmed the focus of key objectives addressed in the

8
authorities’ medium-term economic program supported by the three-year PRGF arrangement
(see IMF Country Report No. 09/133). These priorities informed the discussions, namely to


Accelerate the pace of structural reforms to remove impediments to growth and
improve the business climate (MEFP ¶ 45–48). Improving cocoa sector productivity,
and hence farm incomes, would have a major impact on poverty, which is
concentrated in rural households. Restoring the viability of the electricity sector was
also viewed as critical. Strengthening the judicial system is vital to encouraging
private sector activity and investment.



Create fiscal space for pro-poor expenditures and much-needed infrastructure outlays,
which had been cut back during the crisis years (MEFP ¶ 35–36). Debt relief and a
more sustainable wage bill are essential for managing spending generally and
expanding high-priority spending. These elements, together with continued efforts to
increase revenue, will be essential ingredients for a sustainable fiscal position over
the medium term.



Address vulnerabilities in the financial system, including the pensions funds, and
define a clear role for the government in the banking system, especially to improve
financial intermediation and provide support for domestic investment
(MEFP ¶ 40–44).



Make further progress on debt restructuring and strengthening competitiveness
(MEFP ¶ 19–20 and 45–50). Early attainment of HIPC and MDRI debt relief would
have a major impact on external and fiscal sustainability. Building competitiveness is
necessary to diversify the economy and reduce the vulnerability of the export base to
volatile commodity prices and the projected terms of trade decline over the medium
term.
A. Growth and Poverty: The Macroeconomic Framework and Outlook

9.
The outlook for 2009–10 tracks the program’s medium-term macro-framework,
with sustained real GDP growth, low inflation, and rising investment. Growth should
reach 4 percent in 2010 with further political stabilization, rising public and private
investment, a return in confidence, and a gradually improving global environment. Inflation
should continue at the low WAEMU norm.
10.
In the medium term, Côte d’Ivoire’s economy should firm up as confidence
returns and structural reforms are undertaken (MEFP ¶ 33). The baseline scenario
assumes a gradual recovery in private investment from less than 7 percent of GDP in 2009 to
about 9½ percent in 2014 and increased public investment, especially in infrastructure
(Table 5). As the sizable output gap gradually narrows and efficiency improves over the

9
medium term,1 average GDP growth of 5 percent is projected. Oil extraction and export
agriculture are assumed to grow somewhat less than activities like food agriculture and
processing, construction, and services. The external current account balance (excluding
grants) is expected to weaken gradually with increased import demand, especially for
investment, and by 2014 reach a deficit of 5–6 percent of GDP, which could be financed by
foreign direct investment, enhanced donor support, and private capital inflows. Fiscal
consolidation should result in a primary surplus of 1¼ percent of GDP. Fiscal consolidation,
measures to tackle structural impediments to growth, and monetary restraint will contribute
to domestic stability as well as to the external stability of the WAEMU.
11.
Nonetheless, significant risks remain. The authorities’ track record under two
EPCAs and the PRGF arrangement to date was broadly in line with Fund advice under the
2007 Article IV consultation, and the commitment to the program by all political parties in
Côte d’Ivoire provides a reasonable basis for continued successful program implementation.
An illustrative downside scenario highlights the risks for growth of a too-protracted political
normalization, faltering implementation of structural reforms, and a continued lack of
confidence. The scenario projects average annual growth of some 2 percentage points lower
than in the baseline (Table 5). It assumes a lack of cocoa sector reforms resulting in
30 percent lower output by 2014 compared to the baseline, and 20 percent less oil extraction.
These would delay the narrowing of the output gap, so there would be little per capita
growth, and would worsen the outlook for public finances, possibly leading to unsustainable
deficits. The external current account would deteriorate more abruptly and possibly endanger
the aim of reaching external debt sustainability.
B. Competitiveness and the Business Climate
12.
Authorities and staff agreed that
Relative Prices and Effective Exchange Rates (Index 1994=100)
1994-2009
competitiveness needed to be strengthened. The
real effective exchange rate (REER) is still some
15 percent below where it was before the 1994
devaluation of the CFAF. Côte d’Ivoire’s REER
appears to be broadly in line with fundamentals,
though quantitative estimates of the equilibrium real
exchange rate are subject to broad margins of
uncertainty and poor data quality. The Ivorian REER
closely tracks the WAEMU REER, which, as the
last external stability assessment concluded, is
generally in line with fundamentals. However, export performance has been held back by the

When considering investment efficiency, the incremental capital-output ratio (ICOR) serves as a guide. Côte
d’Ivoire’s ICOR has been trending upward since the crisis began, indicating a decline in investment efficiency.
The baseline scenario assumes a gradual decrease of the ICOR to the precrisis level.

10
deterioration in the business environment and the inability to sustain structural reforms since
the internal crisis began.2 Looking ahead, the projected decline in the terms of trade over the
short term would also depress export performance and the current account.
13.
The authorities agreed that the gradual
Market shares in world exports (Index 1994=100)
1994-2008
weakening in international competitiveness stems
primarily from structural factors. Côte d’Ivoire’s
share in world exports continues to decline because
its export base is relatively narrow—consisting
mainly of cocoa/coffee (44 percent of exports), oil
and oil products (16 percent), and timber, lumber,
and cotton (15 percent). Worse, the main exports are
primary commodities whose international prices are
volatile. Structural deficiencies and a poor business
environment are the main drags on competitiveness,
as mentioned by the mission's numerous private

low, with credit to the private sector amounting to
only 13 percent of GDP (the SSA average is
36 percent); and annual foreign direct investment is

only 2 percent of GDP. To redress this, the authorities
agreed on the crucial importance of structural reforms for re-establishing business confidence
and raising investment and growth. In particular, they are preparing a comprehensive reform
of the coffee/cocoa sector, the driving force of the economy, in order to improve
productivity. They also intend to raise oil production with technology upgrades and build up
the traditional rubber, timber, and food-processing industries, which have substantial export
potential. These measures are to be supported by judicial reform.

Côte d’Ivoire contributes to regional integration within the WAEMU and
ECOWAS, which should promote efficiency in tradable goods production and create
new export opportunities. The authorities indicated that a fifth tariff band (35 percent) has
been added to the ECOWAS common external tariff, and the products it will cover are being
identified (MEFP ¶ 49). Staff noted this with regret, and suggested limiting the products
included in the new band, and working towards reducing the rate, and eventually returning to
the previous maximum tariff of 20 percent. Discussions with the European Union have

resulted in a regional interim Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) that is to be signed in
October. The accompanying development program has been adopted by the countries in the
subregion, the support program for regional trade and integration is being implemented, and
EPA financing programs are being drafted.
C. Strengthening the Financial Sector
15.
The authorities agreed with staff on the need to reduce vulnerabilities in the
financial sector, expand access to financial services, and deepen financial
intermediation. They also agreed with the major findings of the FSAP, namely that there are
pockets of weakness in the banking system, with some locally owned banks faring
significantly worse than others; the insurance and pension sectors require major reforms; and
the viability of the microfinance sector is fragile (Box 1, Table 6, and Appendix I;
MEFP ¶ 38–44).
16.

The authorities generally agreed with the FSAP’s main recommendations:



Bank solvency and asset quality should be improved and certain banks should be
recapitalized but, unlike the recapitalization of three small insolvent banks in 2008
and early 2009 (at a cost of 0.4 percent of GDP), with limited, if any, government
intervention.



To reduce default risks, loan concentration and connected lending should be reduced
and regulations on connected lending should be strictly enforced.



The increase in government ownership of banks should be reversed, the role of some
government-sponsored banks active in investment and housing finance needs to be
better defined, and the postal savings bank’s initial lending as a commercial bank
should proceed cautiously and benefit from learning by doing.



The stability of the insurance sector and the viability of the pension funds should be
significantly improved



Urgent action is needed to turn the troubled microfinance sector around.

However, the authorities seriously disagreed with the recommendations on possible
liquidation of some troubled banks, the continued existence of which they considered
important to reassuring their clientele. They also considered that the postal savings institution
(CNCE ), in its new role as a commercial bank, has the capacity and expertise to manage
lending operations without any special restrictions.

12
Box 1: Vulnerabilities in the Financial Sector—
Main Findings of the FSAP
The banking sector (19 banks) is relatively liquid and profitable, but the situation of locally-owned banks
(5, with 20.7 percent of assets) should be improved. Many locally-owned banks have liquidity levels below
the prudential limit (75 percent). Average return on assets and on equity rose in 2008 (reaching 1.6 percent and
16 percent, respectively). The ratio of nonbank revenue to gross proceeds (30 percent) and the interest spread
(7 percent) have remained stable since 2001.
Bank solvency and asset quality is uneven. The banking sector’s risk-weighted capital-asset ratio (CAR) was
9¼ percent at end-2008 (but below 8 percent for local banks) and declining, reflecting rapid credit growth and
risk taking. The system-wide nonperforming loan ratio stood at 19 percent, with almost half more than 6 months
overdue, indicating a need to improve asset quality. The provisioning rate was about 77 percent.
Loan concentration and connected lending is high. At end-2008, the 10 largest borrowers accounted for
22 percent of all loans, and regulatory limits on connected lending were breached in many cases, particularly in
banks controlled by local or regional private shareholders.
Government ownership of banks has increased. In 2006–08, the government raised its share in bank capital
from 21.5 percent to 28.6 percent to support troubled institutions. The role of partly state-owned BHCI in
financing housing and that of the fully state-owned investment finance bank, BNI, are not well-defined. The
postal savings institution (CNCE) has just been granted a commercial bank license.
The stability of the insurance sector and the viability of the public pension funds are at risk. The insurance
sector suffers from underpricing and difficulty in settling damages, low minimum capital requirements, and lack
of strong regulation that facilitates prompt liquidation of failed companies. As for pension funds, both the
CNPS (private sector) and the CGRAE (public sector) incur sizable deficits, and recent actuarial studies
highlighted the need for urgent reforms.
The microfinance sector is very weak. Overall, it has negative equity.
Stress Tests
Stress tests confirm the segmentation of the banking system and suggest that further bank failures are
possible. On credit risks if the largest debtor were to default, the sector’s CAR would drop to 6.9 percent; and if
the five largest debtors were to default, it would drop to 4.8 percent. Moreover, if 40 percent of loans to major
businesses operating in the cocoa sector were to become nonperforming, the banking sector’s CAR would drop
to 2.6 percent. Exposure to exchange risk and liquidity risk is low and interest rate risk limited. However, a
combination of a deterioration in the quality of credit, currency depreciation, and a drop in interest rates could
lead to negative CAR and many bank failures. The eight banks and one nonbank financial institution that faced
problems in 2008 are individually modest in scale but systemically significant in the aggregate (30 percent of
total assets).

D. Debt Restructuring and Sustainability
17.
Restoring debt sustainability will be the foundation for improved growth
prospects and will require continued prudent fiscal policies, debt relief, and
concessional donor support (MEFP ¶ 19–20). Côte d’Ivoire has made significant progress
in recent years on fiscal prudence and external debt relief. Sizable external debt service
arrears to multilateral institutions have been cleared, the HIPC decision point was reached in
March 2009, Côte d’Ivoire has benefited from a Paris Club debt restructuring, and it has
recently reached preliminary agreement on debt restructuring with the coordination

13
committee of Brady bond holders (Box 2, Tables 7–8). Also, discussions with other external
commercial creditors on a restructuring of their claims are ongoing. The normalization of
financial relations with external creditors and donors, together with the normalization of the
political and social situation in the near future, should unlock access to sizable donor support.
Box 2: External Debt and Rescheduling
Debt Stock
Côte d’Ivoire’s total external public debt at the end of 2008 is estimated at about US$13.3 billion (61 percent of
GDP), of which US$5.0 billion was in arrears (including late and penalty interest). Some 25 percent of this debt
is owed to multilateral creditors, 52 percent to Paris Club creditors, 1 percent to non-Paris Club bilateral
creditors, and 22 percent is commercial and short-term debt.
Paris Club Rescheduling
Côte d’Ivoire reached the decision point for the enhanced HIPC Initiative in March 2009. In May Paris Club
creditors agreed with the Government of Côte d’Ivoire on debt restructuring on Cologne terms, including, on an
exceptional basis, post-cut-off date (July 1, 1983) debt, short-term debt, and moratorium interest. Paris Club
debt at the end of 2008 was estimated at US$7.0 billion, of which US$3.6 billion was in arrears and 42 percent
was granted after the cut-off date. Côte d’Ivoire had previously had a number of Paris Club debt rescheduling
agreements, most recently in April 2002 on Lyon terms. The participating creditor countries were Austria,
Belgium, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Switzerland, the
United Kingdom, and the United States.
The key terms of this year’s agreement were:


Pre-cut-off date debt maturities falling due during the consolidation period
(April 1, 2009–March 31, 2012) were rescheduled on Cologne terms.



Arrears on pre-cut-off date debt as of March 2009 were rescheduled on Naples terms.



Post-cut-off date maturities falling due during the consolidation period were deferred and made
payable in seven installments in 2012–18.



Arrears on post-cut-off date and short-term debt were deferred, payable on a rising scale September
2009–March 2017.



Moratorium interest on the consolidation and deferral was capitalized (deferred) and made payable in
seven installments during 2012–18. Interest payments on deferred (capitalized) moratorium interest fall
due starting in September 2009.



Bilateral implementation agreements are to be signed before December 2009.

Brady Bond Restructuring
On September 28, 2009, the Government of Côte d’Ivoire and the coordination committee of Brady bond
holders reached a preliminary agreement on restructuring debt outstanding (including arrears) at the end of 2008
of about $2.8 billion. The Government will offer holders of Brady Bonds to exchange them for a new U.S.
dollar-denominated bond, with a discount of 20 percent, a term of 23 years, and six years’ grace. The
amortization profile provides for increasing payments over the repayment period. The interest rate increases in
two steps from 2.5 percent to 5.75 percent in year four. The exchange will occur no later than March 2010.

14
Box 2: External Debt and Rescheduling (concluded)
Other Commercial Debt
Other external commercial creditors hold three types of instruments (Standard Bank/BNI securitizations,
Sphynx 2007–10, and Sphynx 2008–11), each of which are pass-through notes sold to external investors,
backed by Ivorian government securities (MEFP ¶19). At end-2008, outstanding debt (including arrears) related
to these instruments amounted to about $290 million, all of which was due to be repaid during 2009–11.
Following previous agreements on rescheduling arrears and outstanding amounts over 2009–11, arrears again
began accruing early in 2009 and debt service ceased on all three of these instruments. Recently, the authorities
publicly announced their intention to seek to restructure these notes on terms consistent with the Paris Club’s
comparability of treatment requirements and with HIPC requirements. The government has engaged financial
and legal advisors to assist them in negotiations with creditors.

18.
Nevertheless, the conclusion of the low-income country debt sustainability
analysis at the time of the HIPC decision point (see IMF Country Report No. 09/190) is
still valid: Côte d’Ivoire is at high risk of debt distress. The macroeconomic assumptions
underlying the earlier
LIC-DSA are broadly unchanged, though export performance and the fiscal primary surplus
in the medium term are slightly stronger. The LIC-DSA also found that debt relief from the
HIPC Initiative, the MDRI, and possible bilateral and multilateral debt forgiveness beyond
HIPC assistance at the completion point (assumed, for illustrative purposes, to be in 2011)
would reduce external debt indicators below the relevant thresholds.
III. PROGRAM DISCUSSIONS
A. Program Performance and Financing Through June 2009
19.
Program implementation at the end of June 2009 was broadly on track (MEFP
¶14–16). The authorities met four of the six performance criteria (PC) and missed the others
(overall balance and external arrears) by only small margins (Table 9). The deviation on the
overall balance reflected a programming error.3 The structural benchmarks were mostly met
(Table 10).


The overall balance was substantially within the corrected program target, and
both revenues and expenditures were more than programmed.



Revenues exceeded the program by ½ percent of GDP, helped by favorable cocoa
exports and oil extraction (Table 11 a–b; MEFP ¶ 3, 15). Export duty collection from
cocoa was boosted by exceptionally high world prices and late shipments from the
2008/09 crop. Tax revenue from oil was higher than expected reflecting more

3

For June the indicative wage bill target had been set too low due to a technical error. This also affected two
PCs—overall balance and net domestic financing—and the indicative target for the primary balance (Table 9).

15
production and world prices above the budgeted US$50 per barrel; however, the
envisaged transfer of dividends from the national oil company was deferred until the
second half of the year, thus not activating the adjustor for excess oil revenue. VAT
revenue was also healthy, but somewhat inflated by slow credit refunds. These factors
more than offset the serious shortfall in import duties caused by lower import volume
and prices, administrative problems and strikes, and the unplanned continuation of the
import tax exemption for rice.


Expenditures were also ½ percent of GDP above target owing to overruns on the
electricity subsidy and the wage bill (MEFP ¶ 3, 16). Most current expenditure items
and investment spending were held within objectives. However, subsidies to cover
the deficit of the electricity sector rose with suppliers’ gas prices and exceeded the
program objective (by 0.2 percent of GDP), despite an increase in electricity tariffs
for most households at the end of 2008. Transfers to some educational and health
structures also exceeded the program target (by 0.1 percent of GDP). There was a
small wage bill overrun above the indicative target due to early wage payments for a
number of public entities. Other current expenditures were above program objectives
(by 0.4 percent of GDP), reflecting inter alia compensation of cross-liabilities with
suppliers and discretionary presidential spending. Crisis-exit and pro-poor spending
was slightly below plans, despite a significant acceleration in outlays since March.
Interest savings on foreign debt after Paris Club debt relief were partly absorbed by
higher domestic interest costs, as the government had recourse to costly short-term
domestic financing (short-term Treasury bills and nonbank financing).

20.
The authorities limited spending on large public works (grands travaux) to the
budget envelope and moved ahead on transparency, although more slowly than
expected (MEFP ¶28). The Inter-Ministerial Monitoring Committee approved an audit of the
government’s debt to the dominant operator in May 2009 that should be completed before
year-end. The first five framework agreements signed with this operator are now being
converted to conform to the Public Procurement Code. As the timetable for these projects has
been stretched out, the conversion of the other contracts will take longer.
21.
While the fiscal deficit was substantially on target, tight domestic liquidity
conditions made its financing challenging, especially in the first quarter (MEFP ¶ 4, 18).
Because the WAEMU financial market proved tight, the government did not raise the
expected amounts of new funds. Thus domestic arrears increased throughout the first quarter.
However, the World Bank and IMF disbursements in April and the Paris Club debt
restructuring in May eased the financing constraints. Overall, domestic arrears reduction
through June exceeded the program. At the same time, however, external debt service arrears
were accumulated to multilateral financial institutions owing to a lack of coordination
between debt and treasury managers. Measures to ensure better coordination and give
priority to external debt service payments have since been introduced, and these external
arrears were cleared in September–October 2009.

16
22.
Structural reforms are advancing in revenue administration and public
expenditure management, but slowly (Tables 10 and 12; MEFP ¶ 7). Although progress
was made in inventorying quasi-fiscal fees levied by ministries (the structural benchmark for
June 2009), the work could not be completed because some ministries failed to cooperate.
The audit of crisis-exit spending foreseen in the PFM plan has been delayed to year-end.
However, reporting on budget execution reporting is better and implementation of the
government’s PFM action plan has begun. Treasury advances have been contained.
B. The 2009 and 2010 Budgets and Financing
The 2009 fiscal program
23.
With budget revenue and expenditure running somewhat ahead of the targets,
the authorities now expect the budget deficit for the year to be marginally higher than
programmed, in part because some election-related outlays were brought forward into 2009.


Revenue should reach 19.6 percent of GDP, an overperformance of 0.6 percent of
GDP that arose from both higher oil and cocoa revenues and more forceful collection
of VAT and income tax (MEFP ¶ 15).



Outlays are projected at 21.7 percent of GDP, an overshooting of 0.7 percent of GDP,
due mainly to growing electricity subsidies (to offset losses) and the advancing of
payments on the voter registration contract to 2009. The authorities are seeking a
lasting solution to the problems of the power sector, including a mix of new
investment, renegotiation of input contracts, and tariff adjustments (MEFP ¶ 16).

Sources: Ivorian authorities; and IMF staff estimates and projections.
1/ Gap financing in 2008 and projected in 2009 is included in net domestic financing (IMF) and program grants
(World Bank).

24.
The budget deficit is expected to be fully financed from external debt relief and
additional BCEAO funding (Box 3 and MEFP ¶ 50–51), creating room for larger than
programmed clearance of domestic payments arrears and a shrinking of the year-end float
(MEFP ¶18). Interim assistance from multilateral financial institutions and the debt relief
granted by the Paris Club is projected to be 20.9 percent of GDP, and the World Bank,
AfDB, and the Fund are providing 2.3 percent of GDP in new money.
25.
The government obtained additional BCEAO funding in the amount of the
general allocation of Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) by the Fund (1.6 percent of GDP)
(MEFP ¶ 18). The WAEMU Council of Ministers in August decided that the BCEAO could
extend new CFAF credit lines to member states (at 3 percent interest over 10 years with
3 years’ grace) up to the equivalent of the recent general allocation for the purpose of
reducing domestic arrears at the end of 2008 by two-thirds; no timeframe was specified for
the arrears reduction. The authorities have used the new BCEAO funding in part to substitute
for other more expensive forms of regional funding.

18
The 2010 fiscal program
26.
Fiscal prudence is to continue in 2010, with new developments including a
decline in cocoa taxation and a winding down of crisis-exit spending (MEFP ¶ 33–36).


Revenues are projected to decline by 0.4 percent of GDP in the absence of the oil and
cocoa windfalls of 2009 and the programmed reduction in cocoa taxation (MEFP
¶34). 4 The latter is intended to increase farm incomes and is one of the completion
point triggers. The authorities intend to continue their efforts to strengthen revenue
administration, including in the CNW. The tax exemptions on rice imports, which
were introduced in 2008 on a temporary basis but continued through 2009, will be
revoked and the supplementary income tax for reconstruction reintroduced.



The authorities expect spending to decline in 2010, but will continue to reallocate
resources toward pro-growth and pro-poor spending ((MEFP ¶ 35–36, Box 2). The
accumulation of unpaid and unbudgeted wage commitments (about 25 percent of the
wage bill) is putting heavy pressure on the wage bill (Figure 2), and the authorities
have agreed to design a comprehensive medium-term solution. They have also agreed
on the need for early action to limit subsidies to the electricity sector and the civil
service pension fund (CGRAE). They intend to freeze large public works spending in
nominal terms.

27.
The projected financing gap (3.5 percent of GDP) is expected to be filled mostly
by budget support from multilateral financial institutions, more debt relief than
initially programmed, and domestic financing (Text Table 2 and Table 13;
MEFP ¶ 50–51). The authorities plan to continue to reduce domestic arrears. The amounts to
be raised in the regional market are in line with the level of such financing in the past.

4

Effective with the start of the 2009–10 crop year, the cocoa export registration tax was further reduced from
10 to 5 percent of the CIF price (estimated cost: 0.5 percent of GDP), and the single export duty on cocoa was
further decreased from CFAF 220 to CFAF 210 per kilogram (cost: 0.1 percent of GDP).

19
C. Structural Reforms in 2009–10
Public financial management
28.
Structural reforms in public finances in the rest of 2009 seek to further improve
transparency, the use of public resources, and budget execution (MEFP ¶ 21–32, 37).


Rationalizing revenue collections (MEFP Box 3). The authorities intend to complete
the inventory of ministries’ administrative fees and budgetize them, along with the
quasi-fiscal levies in the cocoa/coffee sector earmarked for investment. VAT credits
awaiting reimbursement are to be reduced and capped. Also, the authorities intend to
establish a strategy to rationalize tax exemptions.



Improving expenditure management and treasury operations (MEFP ¶ 22–23).
Implementation of the PFM action plan is to gather momentum. In particular, the
interface between the budget execution (SIGFiP) and public accounts (ASTER)
software is to be made operational before year-end, along with an application for
managing treasury advances.



Strengthening the budgetary framework (MEFP ¶ 24). The authorities are preparing
to adopt a new functional classification in line with the 2001 Government Finance
Statistics Manual, and to harmonize the budgetary framework with other WAEMU
member countries. Medium-term expenditure frameworks (MTEF) are being
prepared for education and health, to be phased in with the 2011 budget to facilitate
the shift toward pro-poor expenditures. The authorities plan to begin developing
multiyear budgeting in other ministries in the coming months.

29.
Major steps are to be taken to reinforce public procurement (MEFP ¶ 27). The
authorities plan to set up a National Procurement Regulation Authority by year-end that
would enforce the new Public Procurement Code. Bids to tender for public procurements will
be published, and a unified threshold above which contracts must abide by the procurement
code is to be established. The remaining framework agreements on large public works are to
be converted into contracts that conform with the procurement code.
30.
The authorities intend to implement decisive civil service reforms in 2010 (MEFP
¶ 26). Although delayed, the census of civil servants is underway, and an integrated
personnel management system is to be set up that covers both civil servants and the police.
The government is committed to putting together a sustainable medium-term wage bill
strategy (to be discussed during the second PRGF review in early 2010). A new supervisory
body is to prepare a plan for restructuring of the Civil Service Pension Fund (CGRAE) before
year-end.
31.
Further action is needed to strengthen the monitoring and restructuring of
public enterprises (MEFP ¶ 27–29). The General Finance Inspectorate (IGF) report on the

20
financial situation of state-owned enterprises is now available, audits of specific firms have
started, and more attention is being paid to the collection of dividends. Preparation of a
strategy to restructure the sector should be accelerated.
Financial sector reform
32.
Building on the recommendations of the FSAP the authorities aim to reduce
vulnerabilities and clarify the government’s role in the financial system (MEFP ¶38–44).
A broader assessment of technical assistance needs is planned for early 2010.


The authorities intend to strengthen the prudential and supervisory framework
(adoption of amendments to the banking law and the law on combating the financing
of terrorism, and support for the work of the Banking Commission) (MEFP ¶ 41).



They have taken steps to enforce minimum capital requirements, monitor carefully
those banks subject to Banking Commission injunctions, and restructure and
recapitalize commercial banks in distress, but without injection of budgetary
resources (MEFP ¶ 40).



A feasibility study is planned to define the role of BHCI, the social housing bank, in
housing finance (MEFP ¶40).



The authorities are requesting technical assistance from the World Bank on
rehabilitating microfinance institutions (MEFP ¶ 42–43).



The authorities intend to prepare a Financial Sector Development Strategy (FSDS)
that would define a reduced role of the state in the financial sector, and have initiated
a request to Financial Sector Reform and Strengthening (FIRST) Initiative to finance
technical assistance for this purpose.



They have requested technical assistance in public debt management.



To improve regional liquidity management, the government intends to better plan its
issuance of securities in the regional market and coordinate monthly with other
WAEMU members (MEFP ¶ 38–39). It will also seek the restructuring of arrears on
the consolidated statutory overdraft from the BCEAO.

Other structural reforms
33.
The authorities also aim to enhance the efficiency of the economy and improve
the business climate (MEFP ¶45–49). They agreed on the urgent need for action, but also
cited constraints in the current political climate. Nonetheless, recognizing the slow progress
in implementing their reform agenda in the first half of 2009, the authorities committed to
complete a number of actions by year-end, especially in the areas of transparency (submitting

21
2006–07 EITI reports; auditing a number of public enterprises) and in preparing reforms of
the electricity sector, pension funds, and the judicial system (Table 12).
34.
Reform plans for 2010 are vital to improve the business climate and productivity
(MEFP ¶ 46–48). They cover the cocoa and energy sectors and the judicial system.


The authorities recognize that the cocoa/coffee sector is a driver of growth and the
reduction of rural poverty (MEFP ¶ 47). While the interim administration in 2008
improved transparency, the government is now designing a more effective and
transparent institutional and regulatory framework for the sector with support from
the World Bank. To increase farm incentives and incomes, cocoa taxation will be
further reduced and the registration and single export duties will be consolidated into
a single ad valorem tax for the 2010–11 crop year.



Crucial for robust growth will be restoration of the financial viability of the electricity
sector (MEFP ¶ 48). The authorities intend to address immediate financing needs
based on discussions with all stakeholders and to advance the restructuring of the
sector to limit operating deficits and generate adequate resources for much-needed
investment in generation capacity and transmission.



The judicial system reform program includes adoption of the law on mandatory
enforcement of decisions of the Arbitrations Board to help unclog the regular courts
(MEFP ¶ 46 and Box 7). Also, the authorities plan to set up commercial courts and
train judiciary staff in commercial matters, and more broadly to enhance the
efficiency and fairness of the judicial system.
IV. PROGRAM MONITORING

35.
The authorities request for two waivers of performance criteria (PCs) and
propose slight program modifications. The deviation from the PC on the overall fiscal
balance reflected a programming error in constructing the quarterly targets for the wage bill
(Table 9); the seasonal factors used in deriving the quarterly targets have been revised and
agreed between the authorities and the staff. The accumulation of new external debt service
arrears to multilateral financial institutions was the result of inadequate internal
communications between debt and treasury managers. The arrears have been cleared and
internal coordination improved through weekly meetings, and priority is to be given to the
payment of debt service falling due.5 The authorities request minor modifications to the
definition of the PC on the overall fiscal balance and treasury advances (indicative target),
and a more extensive reformulation of the PC on the accumulation of new external arrears,
5

Also, the authorities have requested technical assistance from the World Bank and the Fund on debt
management.

22
which is intended to tighten the original definition of the PCs (see supplement to the
Technical Memorandum of Understanding). These changes would take effect with the
approval of this review.
36.
Regarding the Financing Assurances Review, the authorities have made significant
progress in clearing external arrears and assuring full financing of the program. They have
regularized relations with multilateral creditors, despite modest temporary arrears to some. A
comprehensive Paris Club rescheduling agreement was reached in May 2009, and the
authorities are pursuing discussions with other official bilateral creditors. A preliminary debt
restructuring agreement was reached in September 2009 with the coordination committee of
Brady bond holders. The government is committed to engaging in collaborative discussions
with its other external commercial creditors with a view to reaching an agreement through an
open and transparent dialogue based on the principle of inter-creditor equity.6 Staff believes
that the government’s strategy is consistent with the “good faith” criterion of the Fund’s
lending into arrears policy.
37.
The authorities have made progress so far in 2009 on structural reforms in line
with program objectives (and met or partially met the structural benchmarks), though
at a pace slower than envisaged earlier. The focus to date was on revenue administration
and public expenditure management, and these areas will remain important in the period
ahead. The second PRGF review will concentrate on progress regarding the year-end
structural benchmarks in these areas (Table 10 and MEFP Table 3), and will set benchmarks
for 2010. Progress in other areas (the business climate, competitiveness, reforms in the
cocoa/coffee, electricity and financial sectors, and the judicial system) will also be assessed.
In addition, the implementation of the PRSP will be reviewed.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
38.
Côte d’Ivoire’s economy has been resilient to the global economic crisis, and
growth has strengthened as the political normalization and reunification of the country
nears completion. The domestic recovery from the prolonged crisis has been helped by
favorable terms of trade, especially with respect to exports of cocoa, an industry that is the
source of livelihood of a large part of the rural population. The temporary spike in inflation
in 2008 stemming from the high cost of food and fuel imports subsided quickly in 2009 as
international prices eased and ample rainfall resulted in strong growth in agriculture and
related processing. Higher growth and lower inflation have helped to arrest the severe
deterioration in social indicators that occurred during the crisis. At the same time, the
country’s external position has strengthened and regularization and eventual reduction of its
external debt to sustainable levels is underway. The REER appears to be broadly in line with
fundamentals, but structural reforms are badly needed to strengthen competitiveness and
improve the business climate.
6

Arrears accumulated during the program period to these creditors are not considered arrears for program
purposes as they are subject to rescheduling or restructuring.

23
39.
The authorities have significantly strengthened macroeconomic management.
Their efforts began in 2007–08 with the support of two EPCAs and continued with the
adoption of the PRSP in early 2009 and the design of the medium-term program that is
supported by the PRGF arrangement. Despite setbacks and the need for continued, perhaps
even stronger, efforts, the authorities have improved the fiscal position and public financial
management and begun to embark on much-needed structural reforms.
40.
Côte d’Ivoire’s performance in the first six months of the PRGF-supported
program was satisfactory. The government achieved a primary budget surplus and cleared
arrears to multilaterals while restructuring its debt to Paris Club and, on a preliminary basis,
London Club creditors; discussions with remaining external commercial creditors continue.
Structural reforms have made some advances, though more slowly than planned, but
deployment of the poverty reduction strategy has as yet been more institutional than
substantive.
41.
The overall fiscal outcome substantially met the targets. The authorities are
making commendable sustained efforts to redeploy tax administration in the CNW, mobilize
non-oil revenue, increase pro-poor expenditure, clear domestic arrears, and improve fiscal
transparency. The authorities share the staff’s concerns about the large contingent wage
commitments accumulated over the years and the unsustainable deficits in the electricity
sector and the pension funds. These take a major toll on any fiscal space arising from
reforms, political normalization, or economic growth, at the expense of urgent reconstruction
and social needs.
42.
Staff regrets the accumulation of external arrears to multilateral creditors.
However, staff supports the authorities’ request for two waivers of the PCs on the
overall fiscal balance and the injunction against new external arrears in light of the
strong corrective actions undertaken, which are designed to prevent a recurrence.
43.
In the year ahead, the authorities need to press ahead with their plans to
improve public resource management. They include continued fiscal consolidation and
civil service reform, which is critical for long-term fiscal and debt sustainability. Also, the
authorities should continue to make public spending more transparent, especially for large
public works, in conformity with the Public Procurement Code. Staff supports the
authorities’ intention to continue to reorient spending to areas critical for poverty reduction,
social reconciliation, and peace, as well as much-needed investment in infrastructure.
44.
Staff supports the structural reforms in other macro-critical areas as outlined in
the PRSP. These need to be accelerated because they are key to promoting growth and
reducing poverty, as well as to addressing medium-term challenges of improving the
business climate, attracting investors, and strengthening competitiveness in light of the
projected deterioration in the terms of trade. The reforms include, in the cocoa/coffee sector,
the further reduction of taxation of farmers while improving general tax administration to

24
offset the related revenue loss. In the energy sector, the authorities are encouraged to move
urgently on the electricity sector deficit and to improve transparency in conformity with EITI
procedures. In the financial sector, the authorities should address the serious vulnerabilities
identified by the 2009 FSAP: decline of bank solvency, undercapitalized small local banks,
and near-insolvent major microfinance networks. The authorities should also support the
Banking Commission in ensuring bank compliance with prudential norms. No further public
resources should be used to support nonsystemic troubled banks subject to Banking
Commission injunctions.
45.
Staff welcomes the progress made by the authorities in normalizing financial
relations with external creditors. Their good faith efforts to achieve a restructuring
consistent with the Paris Club’s comparability of treatment requirements and with the
principle of intercreditor equity should be continued in order to restore a sustainable debt
position and normal relations with creditors. While Côte d’Ivoire remains at high risk of debt
distress, prospective debt relief at and after the HIPC completion point, together with a
continued prudent borrowing policy, would be able to reduce Côte d’Ivoire’s debt to
sustainable levels over the medium term.
46.
Implementation of the envisaged macroeconomic policies should contribute to
both domestic stability and the external stability of the WAEMU, and over time also
help Côte d’Ivoire to comply with the WAEMU convergence criteria.
47.
The risks to the program appear manageable. Strong ownership of the program by
the current government and all presidential candidates is critical. The risk from persistent
governance problems should be reduced by structural reforms that lead to greater
transparency and accountability. The risk from fiscal slippages should be reduced by
determined implementation of PFM and sectoral reforms that facilitate reduction in subsidies
and better control of the wage bill.
48.
On the basis of the authorities’ record so far and their commitment to
determined implementation of their program, staff recommends completion of the first
review of the PRGF arrangement and of the financing assurances review.
49.
It is proposed that during the PRGF arrangement Côte d’Ivoire move to a 24-month
Article IV consultation cycle in accordance with the decision on consultation cycles
approved on July 15, 2002.

APPENDIX—LETTER OF INTENT

Abidjan, November 4, 2009
Mr. Dominique Strauss-Kahn
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington DC, 20431
Dear Mr. Strauss Kahn:
1.
Côte d’Ivoire is making progress towards the complete normalization of its
sociopolitical and economic situation. Advances in the crisis-exit process, through the
implementation of the Ouagadougou Political Accord, are expected to lead to the holding of
the first round of presidential elections on November 29, 2009.
2.
The government is implementing its economic program supported under the
Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) and its poverty reduction strategy in
the context of the HIPC Initiative. Budget execution is consistent with the framework for
rehabilitation of public finance management, through the implementation of the action plan
resulting from the Public Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability Review
(PEMFAR).
3.
With regard to execution of the 2009 budget, efforts to raise revenues and bring
expenditures under control have resulted in a primary basic surplus in the first half.
Revenue performance was good despite shortfalls related to the suspension of customs duties
and the rice development tax. Substantial efforts have been undertaken to bring expenditures
under control. However, the subsidy to the electricity sector exceeded the end-June objective.
Execution of the large public construction projects is under control, and the government
expects remain within the planned CFAF 40 billion envelope while following the
institutional framework established in the context of the program to monitor these projects.
No extrabudgetary spending was undertaken.
4.
The overall fiscal balance in the first half of 2009 was under control and the
Government intends to pursue its efforts to reach the objectives for the year. After
application of the program adjusters and a technical correction, the fiscal balance at end-June
was better than programmed due to the overall good revenue performance and control of
expenditure.
5.
Progress has been made with regard to structural reforms, despite some delays.
Implementation of the structural reforms continued with special emphasis on revenue

53
collection through efforts against fraud, and the collection of taxes, duties, and fees in the
central, northern, and western zones. Since April 2009, the government has been
implementing the automatic petroleum product pricing mechanism.
6.
The government has also further normalized relations with its international
partners. The discussions have, in some cases, led to the restructuring of outstanding debt.
With respect to the Paris Club, a restructuring agreement has been signed and Côte d’Ivoire
received exceptional treatment. Discussions with the Private Creditors Coordination
Committee (London Club) were concluded with the signature of a preliminary agreement,
and debt restructuring discussions with other commercial creditors were begun.
7.
The government has begun to implement the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper
(PRSP) and the PRSP monitoring framework has been adopted. Priority action matrixes
and sectoral action plans were designed through wide-ranging consultation with sector
stakeholders, figures for which will be included in the preparation of multiyear budgets.
8.
There is a strong national consensus in favor of implementing the program
supported under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF), and reaching the
completion point under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Enhanced Heavily
Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative as soon as possible. The government requests
two waivers of the performance criteria: on the overall fiscal balance at end-June and the
accumulation of new external arrears, and seeks completion of the first program review.
Moreover, for technical reasons we request changes in the three program definitions (the
overall fiscal balance, accumulation of new external arrears with respect to certain
multilateral creditors, and treasury advances) to take effect with the completion of the first
program review.
9.
The attached Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP)
describes progress made under the economic program for 2009, as well as the objectives
for 2009 and 2010. A supplement to the Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU)
of March 13, 2009 is also included. In connection with the completion of the first program
review, the government requests assistance in the amount of SDR 35.772 million from the
IMF under the PRGF, i.e. 11% of quota.
10.
Implementation of the program for 2009 is expected to be broadly satisfactory.
The 2010 budget will press ahead with the objectives of the 2009 budget so as to
consolidate the economic recovery and reduce poverty. The 2010 program is designed to
achieve real GDP growth of 4 percent; stabilize the annual inflation rate at 3 percent; and
slightly increase the overall budget deficit as a percentage of GDP, owing to the increase in
social and investment expenditure. Furthermore, revenue collection efforts will be redoubled.
The government will do its best assiduously to implement the PRSP measures and the
completion point triggers under the HIPC Initiative as soon as possible.

54
11.
The government is firmly committed to make progress in improving governance
and to undertake in-depth structural reforms. The government will strengthen its efforts
to achieve efficiency and transparency in public resource management, within the budget and
in the coffee/cocoa and energy sectors. The program envisages the implementation of major
reforms of the civil service, the social security system and the financial sector.
12.
The government believes that the policies and measures set forth in this
Memorandum are adequate for attaining the program objectives. The government will
adopt any other additional measures that it may deem necessary. The government will
consult with IMF staff, whether on its own initiative or at the request of the IMF Managing
Director, prior to the adoption of such measures, or in the event of changes to the policies set
forth in this Memorandum. The government will provide the IMF with such information as
IMF staff may request regarding progress achieved in implementing the economic and
financial policies and in attaining the program objectives.
13.
The Ivorian authorities consent to the release to the public of this Letter of
Intent, the attached MEFP, and the attached Technical Memorandum of
Understanding (TMU), as well as the IMF staff report relating to the request for the
first review of the PRGF arrangement. We hereby authorize their publication and
inclusion on the IMF website, following completion of the review by the IMF Executive
Board.

Very truly yours,
________/s/_________

Minister of Economy and Finance

55
ATTACHMENT I—CÔTE D’IVOIRE: SUPPLEMENT TO THE MEMORANDUM OF ECONOMIC
AND FINANCIAL POLICIES
November 2, 2009
This supplement describes implementation of the 2009 economic program set out in the
memorandum of March 13, 2009 and presents the main outline of the 2010 program.
I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Côte d’Ivoire is moving towards full normalization of its social, political and
economic situation. Progress in the crisis-exit process, through the implementation of the
Ouagadougou Political Accords, is expected to lead to holding the first round of the
presidential elections on November 29, 2009. Voter registration began in September 2008
and was completed on June 30, 2009. It covered 75.49 percent of the target population,
registering 6.5 million people. After verification of the electoral list by cross-checking data
from the registration with historical files, it should be possible to publish the list in October,
2009 and begin organizing the first round of the presidential election. In addition, with a
view to consolidating the peace, 8000 mixed staff from the Integrated Command Center
(CCI) comprising the defense and security forces (FDS) and the armed forces of the New
Forces (FAFN) are being redeployed to ensure the safe conduct of the elections. Furthermore,
tax offices are being gradually redeployed throughout the country, expanding activities to
cover all taxes and duties. In this regard, the Bouaké Regional Tax Administration and One
Stop Shop Automobile Customs Office commenced operations in May 2009. A final solution
has been found to the military issues that, to some extent, were holding up the peace process.
Demobilization of FAFN ex-combatants has effectively commenced.
2.
The government is implementing its economic program supported by the
Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) and its poverty reduction strategy in
the context the HIPC Initiative. Budget management is set within in the framework for
rehabilitating public finances and transparency through the implementation of the action plan
resulting from the Public Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability Review
(PEMFAR) and the publication of quarterly reports on budget execution to the Council of
Ministers.
3.
For the first half of 2009, total revenue excluding grants for clearance of external
arrears performed well despite shortfalls resulting from the suspension of customs
duties and the development tax on rice (CFAF 14 billion at end-June 2009).
Considerable efforts have been made to control spending. However, subsidies to the
electricity sector overran the target by CFAF 19 billion, despite the tariff increase adopted in
December 2008, with effect in 2009. Other current expenditures (including social spending,
toxic waste, and share participation) overran the target by CFAF 20 billion, mainly because
of the settlement through compensation of cross-liabilities of the government and electricity
and telephone sectors.

56
4.
The overall fiscal deficit excluding grants for clearance of external arrears
amounted to FCAF 56.1 billion compared to a target (adjusted and corrected) of
CFAF 72.5 billion. For the year 2009, revenue and expenditure projections, based on endJuly data, forecast a fiscal deficit (excluding grants for clearance of external arrears) of
CFAF 149.8 billion.
5.
The 2010 budget goals are based on the assumptions of the 2010 macroeconomic
and budgetary frameworks. They target real GDP growth of 4 percent, consumer price
inflation (IHPC) of 3 percent, and an overall budget deficit (including grants, except for
external arrears reduction) of 1.6 percent of GDP. The government will apply itself
assiduously to fulfill the completion point triggers under the HIPC Initiative as soon as
possible. In order to attain these macroeconomic goals, the government will continue the
budget reforms initiated under the PEMFAR program, and reforms in the main sectors of the
economy and in public administration.
II.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS

6.
So far, the Ivorian economy has withstood the global crisis and economic
recovery is well under way. Despite the general downturn in global economic activity
following the international crisis, the goal of GDP growth of 3.7 percent by the end of
December 2009 is still attainable, based on data at end-June 2009. This outcome will depend
on the resumption of financial relations with international partners, prudent budgetary policy,
significant progress in the reunification of the country and the peace process, and good
performance in the primary (+5.9 percent) and tertiary sectors (+3.6 percent), particularly
mining, food agriculture, transport and telecommunications. Export agriculture has stagnated.
A disease affecting the orchards has slowed growth in the volume of cocoa production.
Similarly, structural problems have limited cotton and coffee production. The external
current account improved, thanks to the strong performance of cocoa and crude oil prices and
the reduction in prices of food imports. After a sharp increase at the beginning of the year,
inflation has abated. On a year-on-year basis, inflation eased and was negative 1.8 percent at
end-August, reflecting the reduction in international and national food prices and favorable
climatic conditions. On an average annual basis over the same period, inflation was
3.1 percent, close to the WAEMU norm of 3 percent. The real exchange rate appreciated as a
result of a temporary increase in inflation.
7.
Progress has been made in the area of structural reform. Implementation of
structural reforms has continued with a particular emphasis on revenue mobilization, through
anti-fraud efforts and collection of taxes and duties in the former Center-North-West (CNW)
zones. In addition, since April 2009, the government has been implementing the automatic
petroleum pricing mechanism adopted in February 2009. Lastly, reports on budget execution
and on physical and financial flows in the energy and coffee/cocoa sectors continue to be
published regularly.

57
The main reforms undertaken are summarized as follows:


Since April 14, 2009, pump prices of petroleum products have been set using the
automatic pricing mechanism, based on import price parity, adopted by the
government on February 27, 2009. In addition, the level of government debt to the
refinery (SIR) was established by an agreement. A repayment mechanism was
adopted and is being implemented in the context of the automatic pricing mechanism.
The government has stepped up efforts to combat fraud involving petroleum products,
including through chemical marking of liquid products.



In the coffee/cocoa sector, the government has created a Management Committee and
a Reform Committee, which are to propose a new operational framework for the
sector. With the aim of ensuring a more remunerative price for producers, the
government has reduced the registration duty to 5 percent effective with the
2009/2010 crop season, compared with 10 percent in 2008/2009. Similarly, the single
export duty (DUS) was reduced to CFAF 210/kg, compared with CFAF 220/kg. In
line with its commitment, the government has continued to review in the Council of
Ministers and to publish quarterly information on the collection and use of parafiscal
levies in the coffee/cocoa sector. The end-June 2009 report included the status of
resources allocated for the operations of the Management Committee.



The government has conducted a Financial Sector Assessment Program (FASP), in
cooperation with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. It is
committed to implementing recommendations endorsed by consensus among the
FSAP parties. The government continues to monitor carefully banks that have been
the subject of Banking Commission orders.



In the context of improving the transparency of public enterprise management, the
government has stepped up the oversight missions of the Participations and
Privatization Directorate and of the General Finance Inspectorate. In this context, the
audits of public enterprises that began in 2008 are continuing. Short-list tenders have
been held to choose firms to audit ten (10) public enterprises and spending on the
crisis-exit program. These audits began in September 2009.



As regards administrative reform, a census of civil servants is being finalized and
should make it possible to set up a “single reference file” at the beginning of 2010.
III.

SOCIAL POLICIES AND PRSP IMPLEMENTATION

8.
Implementation of the PRSP got off to a slow start. Implementation started in 2009
with an increase in pro-poor spending, which at the end-June amounted to CFAF 390 billion
(about 3.6 percent of GDP). This spending will rise in 2010.

58
9.
The preparation of medium-term expenditure frameworks (MTEF) for
education and health is under way. In the context of PRSP implementation, extensive
consultation with sector stakeholders resulted in the specification of priority action matrices
and action plans. The costing of these needs and corresponding resource allocations will be
issued by the Supervisory Committee before year-end. These will serve as inputs to future
medium-term expenditure frameworks (MTEF), which should be finalized by year-end for
the Ministries of Education and Health.
10.
As regards education, based on the Status Report on the National Education System
(RESEN), the government plans to increase the number of teachers and classes (at a rate
exceeding the growth of the school-age population) in order to reduce class size (from 55 on
average in 2009) and is considering an expansion of training capacity. In addition, a special
effort will be made to ensure, as of the fourth quarter of 2009, that the needs of school
feeding programs are covered throughout the country as well as related infrastructure.
11.
With regard to health, the government has prepared the second National Health
Development Plan (PNDS) for 2009–11. The goal is to improve the population’s access to
the health care system while enhancing its effectiveness and efficiency. To this end, the
government will progressively rehabilitate and construct the health system infrastructure,
particularly rural health care centers, and improve access to essential drugs in line with the
PRSP program. By end-2009, the arrears owed by the Public Health Pharmacy (PSP) to drug
suppliers will be paid in full. Actions will be taken to improve its operations.
12.
The PRSP monitoring framework has been adopted. The PRSP institutional
steering arrangements have been put in place. They consist of three main entities:


The National Steering Committee (CNP), which is the decision-making body for
monitoring of the poverty reduction strategy (PRS), is chaired by the Prime Minister.
It is responsible for: (i) adjusting/correcting the PRS’ strategic orientation, while
ensuring consistency with sectoral policies; (ii) examining and approving the annual
PRS implementation plan; (iii) ratifying the annual PRS budget; (iv) approving the
annual monitoring report on PRS implementation; and (v) will be the final
decision-maker as needed.



The National Supervisory Committee (CNS) supervises the activities of the
Permanent Technical Secretariat Monitoring the PRS (STP-SRP), prepares the
decisions of the Steering Committee and provides a framework for intersectoral
dialogue. Its task is to: (i) examine the annual PRS implementation plan prepared by
the STP; (ii) examine the PRS annual budget; (iii) approve the PRS work plan and
budget; (iv) examine the annual monitoring report on PRS implementation; and
(v) make the necessary technical and operational decisions in order to ensure
consistency between sectoral plans and PRS measures.



The Permanent Technical Secretariat Monitoring the PRS (STP-SRP) is the
operational technical unit for monitoring/evaluating implementation, and reports to

59
the CNS. It spearheads the participatory process of PRS coordination between
stakeholders, to which it can provide technical support. It is also responsible for
monitoring and analyzing the consistency between sectoral policies and the PRS.
13.
The adoption of the institutional framework in August 2009 opens the way for
substantial oversight. It will include the validation of the priority action matrices and action
plans for multi-year program budgeting (MTEF) and for the organization of a meeting with
development partners to mobilize complementary resources. Developments in PRSP
implementation will be covered in a report at end-2009.
IV.

IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PRGF-SUPPORTED PROGRAM IN 2009 AND OUTLOOK FOR

2010
A. Budgetary policy and budget execution in 2009
14.
The overall fiscal balance for the first half of the year was better than expected
and augurs well for controlled budget execution for the rest of the year. Revenue
exceeded the target by 1/2 percent of GDP and, in line with the program, this surplus will
make it possible to increase social and priority spending while also meeting the annual fiscal
balance goal.
15.
The good performance of government revenue masks contrasting outcomes on
tax and customs revenue. In the first half of 2009, tax revenue was greater than expected
due to: (i) strong collection of the main taxes, VAT, payroll taxes, profit tax and coffee/cocoa
registration taxes, which were higher than in the first half of 2008; (ii) higher petroleum
production; (iii) maintaining the cocoa export registration tax at 10 percent until the end of
the 2008/09 crop season; and (iv) progress made in tax administration reforms. This tax
revenue surplus should amount to 1.2 per cent of GDP at the end of the year. However, it
should be noted that at end-June accumulated unpaid VAT credits amounted to 0.2 percent of
GDP. Customs revenue, on the other hand, fell short by 0.6 percent of GDP in the first half of
the year. This shortfall should be reduced to 0.3 percent of GDP by the end of the year. The
weak performance is mainly due to the drop in imports of general goods, the continued
exemption of rice from customs duties, and certain administrative problems (dockers’ strike
and revisions to the Import Recording Form) that were subsequently resolved (Box 1).

60
Box 1: Revenue Measures for 2009
Measures
Taxes (DGI)

Status

Restoration of the effective functioning of tax
and customs administrations in the CNW, in
particular the recovery of car registration taxes
(vignettes), transport tax, VAT, profit (IS) and
income (ITS) taxes, as well as a census and
registration of taxpayers.

Tax administration is redeployed in the CNW,
resulting in effective operation of the Bouaké Regional
Tax Directorate and of the Bouaké One Stop Window
Automobile Customs Office responsible for customs
clearance of motor bikes and vehicles in the CNW.

More widespread application and control of the
standardized VAT invoice with the help of, inter
alia, the creation of new control units.

The Tax Administration has increased the number of
employees responsible for verifying the standardized
invoice by recruiting and training new staff.
Verification covers the entire national territory.

Improved tax administration of the petroleum
sector (extraction and distribution) with the new
unit (sous-direction) for petroleum activities in
the DGI.

The Unit for Petroleum Activities has been established
and organized. Staff are being trained, a census of
taxpayers in the sector has been conducted and
verification, particularly of "cost-oil", has started.

Strengthened verification of “cost-oil” of
operators in the sector to determine, inter alia,
the government’s share in the production of
crude oil and gas.

This assures better management of exemptions in the
sector.

Setting up of, or increase in, the level of
withholding taxes at source for certain economic
agents, notably in agriculture.

Effective for the sawmill and timber sectors.

Better organization of the fight against fraud
through strengthened coordination between DGI
and DGD, the verification of declarations of
warehouse storage, as well as the start up of the
risk management unit.

The tax administration is doing everything possible to
improve the control and organization of the fight
against fraud/evasion through verification of importers
and identification of warehouses. The Coordinating
Committee for activities to combat tax and customs
fraud/evasion is operational.

Customs (DGD)
Apply better customs verification of oil/gas
exports and flows of petroleum products,
notably by specifying the measurement
methods, using technical documentation of the
refinery and of bonded warehouses (entrepôts
sous douane), and by color-marking petroleum
products subject to special tax regimes.

Establishment of an Extraction/Shipments Committee,
which issues monthly extraction/shipment reports.
The Société Générale de Surveillance (SGS), which is
responsible for the marking of petroleum products
subject to special tax regimes, has been operational
since July 2009. In addition, SYDAM-World, the
customs clearance software, which is an improved
version of SYDAM, is helping to streamline
exemptions, in order to allow systematic and detailed
recording of forgone revenues.

61
Box 1: Revenue Measures for 2009 (continued)
Measures
Customs (DGD)
Strengthen efforts to combat fraud/evasion, in
particular by basing verification on risk analysis,
by making the management of international
transit by the border offices and the surveillance
of border zones operational.
Improved verification of values by submitting
all containers disembarked at the Autonomous
Port of Abidjan to risk analysis to determine
those selected for inspection by scanner.

More effective control over exemptions, by
integrating the authorization of exemptions with
the customs clearance system and by generating
data on forgone revenues. A review of all
exemption regimes will be initiated with IMF
assistance before June 2009, with a view to their
streamlining from January 1, 2010.

Status
The Customs Administration has been reorganized to
transform the Risk Analysis and Management Bureau
(BAGR) into the Directorate for Risk Analysis,
Information and Value (DARRV). As part of the
activities of this Directorate, all deliveries are
systematically subjected to risk analysis, in order to
identify possible suspect imports for scanning. In this
connection, a capacity-building plan is being
formulated by the Directorate, which will make
available to customs units (and eventually to the DGI)
a database on risks and violations. In addition, the
customs administration has been redeployed to the
CNW.
The IMF technical assistance mission on verification
of exports of petroleum products, monitoring and
verification of exemptions took place from March 16
to 27, 2009.
The recommendations made in the assistance report
are being analyzed with a view to their
implementation. A seminar has been scheduled for this
purpose in October 2009, to review the existing
regulations and recommendations, with a view to
applying the new arrangements more efficiently.
The government has requested another IMF technical
assistance mission before May 2010 to supplement the
review, and streamlining exemptions as from the 2011
budget.

Other measures
Recognition of government debts to the refinery
(SIR) in the form of the operating deficit (“SSH
négatif”), the gas deficit (“butane”), and fuel
deliveries to the army. Elimination in 2009 of all
these deficits by applying the petroleum product
pricing mechanism, and by budgeting for any
subsidies or operating expenses, and
consolidation of the debt vis-à-vis SIR.

Improved collection of social security
contributions, in particular the collection of
employer contributions from enterprises,
including public enterprises.

A memorandum of understanding in the amount of
CFAF 69.2 billion was signed between the
government and SIR on December 12, 2008.
In order to improve the contribution made to
government revenue by taxes on petroleum products,
to ensure the financial equilibrium of SIR and to clear
accumulated arrears, the government has since April
14, 2009 been implementing the automatic pump
pricing mechanism for petroleum products adopted in
February 2009. For this purpose, the single specific
tax (TSU) on petroleum products, introduced by
Ordinance No. 2009–70 of March 26, 2009, provides
for a levy to clear this deficit.
Data are available on social security contributions
from public enterprises.
Arrangements are being made for effective payment of
amounts owed and for sustainability of the relevant
regulations.

62
Box 1: Revenue Measures for 2009 (concluded)
Measures

Status

Other measures
Systematic collection of dividends from public
enterprises, notably those that manage
significant public resources, such as the
Autonomous Port of Abidjan and PETROCI.

PETROCI dividends for the financial year 2008
amount to CFAF 35 billion.
Mobilization of dividends from public enterprises is
effective.

16.
Expenditure composition improved but there is still room for improvement.
Spending in the first half of the year exceeded the program target by 0.7 percent of GDP and
will continue to do so through the end of the year. As regards current expenditure, the wage
bill will be on target, despite mid-year deviations. The subsidy to the electricity sector,
through partial relinquishment of gas revenue, exceeded the target by 0.2 percent of GDP for
the first half of the year, and should exceed the budget target for 2009 by 0.3 percent of GDP,
because of the delay in adopting the necessary measures to restore equilibrium in the sector.
Investment expenditure was below target during the first half of the year but should
accelerate in the second half, as is generally the case. The implementation of large public
works is under control and the government intends to respect the budget envelope of
CFAF 40 billion, while complying with the institutional arrangements set up for the
monitoring program of these works. There has been no extrabudgetary spending. Fiscal
efforts to combat poverty are well under way. To this end, pro-poor spending, which is much
higher than in 2008, will meet the program target for the year as a whole, despite some
underperformance at mid-year.

The 2009 program will be fully financed and will reflect progress in reducing
domestic arrears and in clearing arrears with external creditors. The government has made
efforts to significantly reduce domestic arrears and amounts payable (restes à payer) of the
Treasury and has made notable progress in negotiations with external creditors.
18.

Domestic/regional financing



The government has reduced its debt to the private sector, so as to stimulate economic
activity. For this purpose, net repayment on a cash basis of the government’s domestic
payment arrears amounted to CFAF 52.7 billion (0.5 percent of GDP), compared with a
floor of CFAF 30 billion in the program. This operation, which was made possible by
budget support from the IMF and the World Bank, allowed payment to all creditors to
which the Treasury owed small amounts and to start dealing with the government’s
large creditors.



Côte d’Ivoire benefited from the decision taken by the WAEMU Council of Ministers
in August to extend to member states the equivalent in CFA francs of the Special
Drawing Rights (SDRs) received under the IMF’s general allocation. The WAEMU
decision envisaged that this pass-through of the allocation, and other financing, would
be used to repay domestic arrears in order to clear two thirds of the stock of arrears at
end-2008. This new general allocation for Côte d'Ivoire amounted to 241.1 million
SDRs, or about CFAF 172.2 billion (1.6 percent of GDP). The IMF’s special allocation
of SDR 32.0 million, or about CFAF 23 billion, is available.



The government’s domestic financing was achieved exclusively through public issuance
of government bonds, as agreed in the program. The government intends to raise a gross
amount of CFAF 612 billion on the regional market in 2009. It will also mobilize the
CFAF equivalent of the general SDR allocation to continue clearing the government’s
domestic arrears and to replace other more expensive types of domestic financing.

19.

External financing



The government has continued to normalize its financial relations with development
partners. Arrears to the AfDB were cleared in March 2009, thanks to a grant from that
Bank’s Fragile States Facility and a bridge loan from an external partner. In addition,
upon reaching the HIPC Initiative decision point in March 2009, Côte d’Ivoire is
receiving interim assistance from the IMF and the World Bank. In the case of the EIB,
an agreement on restructuring the arrears on EIB’s resources was signed on
May 19, 2009. It provides for a rescheduling of arrears over seven years, including a
three-year grace period, and a the cancellation of CFAF 2.3 billion. In addition, arrears
on loans from EDF resources have been cleared using the country’s allocation under the
10th EDF in October. Arrears owed at end-2008 to certain multilateral agencies were
not cleared as anticipated and new arrears on current debt service were accumulated in

65
2009. These were settled in September/October 2009 and the government is committed
to staying current with these creditors.


As regards the Paris Club, a restructuring agreement on Cologne terms was signed on
May 15, 2009. An immediate cancellation of CFAF 413.8 billion was granted, as well
as an exceptional deferral of post-cutoff date arrears, and of scheduled payments and
moratorium interest during the consolidation period for rescheduled and deferred
amounts.



Discussions with the Private Creditors Coordination Committee (London Club) which
began in October 2008 led to a the signing of a preliminary agreement on
September 29, 2009, in Paris. The agreement involves the cancellation of 20 percent of
the end-2009 stock of claims, with remaining claims to be exchanged for a single type
of U.S. dollar-denominated bond. The new bonds will be repaid over 23 years including
a six-year grace period, with a coupon interest rate starting at 2.5 percent and rising to
5.75 percent in the fourth year.



Concerning other commercial debts, the discussions at the beginning of the year with
STANDARD BANK New Jersey (2007 Sphynx bond) focused on the plan for clearing
the arrears of CFAF 10.3 billion accumulated through end-January 2009, by making
monthly payments, which would average CFAF 2.2 billion from February 2009 to July
2009. Normal debt servicing was to resume as soon as these arrears were cleared.
However, because of cash flow difficulties, neither the rescheduled arrears nor current
debt service payments have been paid, with the exception of a payment of
CFAF 1 billion in the second quarter of 2009. In addition, since July 2009 arrears have
accumulated in the servicing of the debt to STANDARD BANK New Jersey
(2008 Sphynx bond). In the case of the debt to Standard Bank London (BNI bond), an
agreement was reached for rescheduling end-2008 arrears of CFAF 10 billion and of the
remainder of CFAF 60 billion due, as well as late payment penalties estimated at
CFAF 900 million; resulting in a total debt of CFAF 71.0 billion. It was agreed that this
debt would be repaid in 26 equal and successive monthly installments of
CFAF 2.7 billion from February 28, 2009 to March 28, 2011 inclusive. A payment of
CFAF 3.2 billion was made in the first quarter of 2009 and a payment of
CFAF 1 billion was made in the second quarter of 2009, after which time payments
have been suspended. Discussions on debt restructuring are being held with these
commercial creditors, on terms comparable to those provided by the Paris Club and
agreed with the Private Creditors Coordination Committee (London Club).

20.
Regarding these three components of our external debt, on September 30, 2009 we
publicly announced that we will pursue a restructuring in line with the Paris Club’s
comparability of treatment requirements and with the IMF's and the World Bank’s
initiative for Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC). We have retained advisors to assist
us in this restructuring, which we intend to conduct in a manner fully consistent with the

66
Fund’s lending into arrears policy, including information transparency, inter-creditor equity,
and dialogue with creditors.
B. Structural reforms in the area of public finance, 2009–10
21.
Progress towards budget orthodoxy was reflected in several improvements in the
regularization of financing operations:


Recourse to costly financing from businesses because of cash-flow pressures has been
stopped since February 2009;



Audits of expenditures of the crisis-exit program, financed from own resources, during
2006–08, commenced in September 2009 and the provisional reports will be available
before end-2009;



The preliminary draft budget execution laws (Lois de réglement) for 2005, 2006 (in
September 2008) and 2007 (in February 2009) have been submitted to the Audit
Chamber (Chambre des comptes) and the preliminary draft budget execution law for
2008 is expected to be finalized in October 2009;



The performance criterion on the non-accumulation of new domestic arrears under the
2009 budget was respected at end-June 2009;



A clearance plan for arrears of VAT credits has been adopted.

22.
Implementation of the action plan for public financial management has begun.
Implementation of the public finance reform plan, adopted in February 2009 following the
PEMFAR technical assistance mission, is organized around a number of strategic pillars. In
general, a good start has been made, in particular on improving the legal and institutional
framework of the system of public financial management, as well as enhancing transparency in
public financial management and public procurement procedures.
23.
As regards the legal and institutional framework of the Public Finance
Management plan (GFP), Côte d’Ivoire is committed to transposing by end-2011 all
community directives adopted in March and June 2009 by the WAEMU Council of Ministers.
To meet this deadline, certain directives, in particular those relating to budget laws and budget
nomenclature, will be fully implemented at the national level during 2010.
24.
Considerable progress has been made on transparency in budget execution. On the
basis of the reports to the Council of Ministers, quarterly budget execution reports are now
posted on the website of the Ministry of Economy and Finance, including statements on
pro-poor expenditure and the execution statements of the Rural Investment Fund (FIMR). As

67
regards technology, the interface between the software for expenditure execution (SIGFIP) and
for public accounting (ASTER) should be operational before end-2009. The adoption of a
functional budget nomenclature in compliance with the Government Finance Statistics Manual
(GFSM) 2001 will be finalized in the first half of 2010. To this end, the consolidation table
linking Ivorian budget nomenclature and GFSM 2001 has been prepared and the glossary has
been approved.
25.
As regards budget discipline, the practice of treasury advances has been contained
within the limits specified by the order of the Minister of Economy and Finance, adopted
in March 2009. A software package to manage advances should be in place for the 2010
budget execution. In addition, a medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF) for the
ministries of health and national education should be adopted in 2010 for the fiscal year 2011.
The MTEF will be extended gradually to cover the other ministries.
26.
With regard to revenue, the inventory of revenue from fees charged by ministries
outside the budget, initially planned for June 2009, remains to be completed. Out of
34 ministries, 20 have been visited resulting in the establishment of 15 revenue sharing
procedures (regimes) for covering the identified revenues. The streamlining of exemption
regimes should continue.
27.
The roadmap for strengthening public procurement, by separating the regulatory,
executive, and control functions, has been adopted. Following the adoption of the new
public procurement code in August 2009, the effective establishment of the National
Procurement Regulation Authority envisaged by the implementing decree is a priority that is
expected to be implemented in the coming weeks. Consideration is being given to the setting of
a national public procurement threshold. Calls for tenders will, in future, be systematically
published on a quarterly basis.

Spending on large public works has been contained and made more transparent in
line with program commitments. Budget allocations for large public works are limited to
CFAF 40 billion for each of the financial years 2009 and 2010, mainly for the development of
Yamoussoukro, the renovation of Hôtel Ivoire and the construction of a third bridge in Abidjan.
To improve transparency, five framework agreements signed with the operator will be
converted into public procurement contracts before end-October 2009. All framework
agreements signed with the operator have, or will have been converted into public procurement
contracts, in accordance with the new public procurement code before end-2010.


The Interministerial Committee established by order 039/PM/Cab of
November 13, 2008, started work on May 8, 2009. It provides operational and financial
oversight of large public works and ratifies the reports of the General Finance
Inspectorate (IGF) and the National Bureau for Technical and Development Studies
(BNETD) on the execution of the public works.



At its meeting on May 8, 2009, this Committee approved undertaking an audit of the
government’s debt to the operator. Accordingly, the audit is being conducted by a firm
engaged following a short list tender. The validated report is expected by end-2009.



Instruction No. 001/PM/CAB of November 13, 2008 requires compliance with budget
execution procedures in connection with large government investment projects. To this
end, two Treasury accounts (revenue and expenditure) have been opened at the Central
Bank of West African States (BCEAO) to ensure the traceability and transparency of
operations. All the financial procedures established by this instruction have been
respected, in particular the recording of the commitment of funds under SIGFIP, and

The conversion of the framework agreements into public procurement contracts is
being undertaken in these stages: (i) finalization of detailed technical studies by the
operator; (ii) examination by BNETD of the technical documents received from the
operator; (iii) determination of specifications and related prices by BNETD; and
(iv) conversion of the agreements into public procurement contracts. Owing to the
associated heavy workload, five projects are being converted into public procurement
projects by end-October 2009. In addition, in line with the government’s commitments,
all agreements will be converted into public procurement contracts by end-2010.
Similarly, all other works for which there is no specific contract yet and have not yet

code.



Budget allocations for the government’s large investment projects during the financial
year 2009 of CFAF 40 billion include reimbursement of the advance of
CFAF 15.6 billion provided by the operator in 2008. As of June 30, 2009, payments
made reflect commitments of CFAF 23 billion (8 billion for the financial year 2009 and
15 billion for reimbursement of the advance in 2008).

29.
Reforms of the civil service sector have commenced. The first stage of the civil
service reform program—a staff census—is being finalized and should permit, if necessary, the
cleaning of civil service records by March 2010, and finalization of the single reference file
before end-2010, including not only public civil servants, as originally planned, but also the
police force. Before end-December 2009, the government intends to review its salary
obligations, including measures concerning the various revaluations or index-linked increases
that had to be postponed, taking into account the structure and compensation parameters of the
payroll. On the basis of this study, it undertakes to formulate a medium-term strategy for the
structure and efficient, sustainable growth of the payroll (before end-March 2010), taking into
account the restructuring and various increases that were postponed. The strategy and its
implementation will be discussed during the second program review.

reform program, based on the findings of the
organizational studies of ministries, including the
appointment of secretary-generals for the ministries.

The proposal for creation of the post of Ministry
Secretary-General will be submitted to the Prime
Minister and will concern certain ministries. A
study is being undertaken to assess the cost of the
post in terms of salary. For the time being, former
administrateurs will be appointed to this function.
Eventually, a section will be created in the
National Administration School (ENA) to provide
training and the necessary skills.

Increase in the retirement age from 55 to 57 for all
civil servants with effect from January 1, 2009, and
its further increase in stages to 60 years for all civil

72
Box 4: Civil Service Reform Plan and Measures for 2009, and
Commitments for 2010 (concluded)
Measures

Status

Validation of actuarial, legal, and institutional
studies for the Civil Service Pension Fund
(CGRAE). Preparation of a plan by end-2009 to
restructure the CGRAE (on the basis of the results of
the studies, including through institutional
strengthening and the introduction of a fully funded
pension plan).

The actuarial, legal, and institutional studies for
the CGRAE were adopted in the Council of
Ministers on August 6, 2009. On this basis, a plan
to restructure the CGRAE was prepared (including
institutional strengthening and the introduction of
a fully funded pension plan). The Interministerial
Committee to execute the reform has been
established and has proposed a reform project that
will be examined in the Council of Ministers. The
reform of the social security fund (CNPS) is being
finalized and will take effect on January 1, 2010.

Limiting the deficit of CGRAE that is borne by the
government’s budget in 2009 to CFAF 56.5 billion
(compared to CFAF 54.3 billion in 2008), in
particular by reducing the operating costs of the
management system.

The CGRAE deficit will be kept within the limits
established in the government’s budget. Proposals
for parametric reforms of the general scheme will
be submitted to the social partners at the beginning
of 2010. The deficit will be limited to
CFAF 30.5 billion in the 2010 budget.

30.
Public enterprise restructuring and privatization. Measures to enhance the
monitoring of the portfolio have resulted in a gradual improvement in the earnings of public
enterprises. In addition, oversight and monitoring of public companies is through audits and
operational verification. Thus, ten (10) state-owned companies are being audited and nine
(9 others will be subject to operational verifications in 2009. The audits began in September
2009. Three enterprises had their operations verified over the period from May 28 to
July 2, 2009.
31.
Strengthening staff resources for monitoring units. To speed up the planned
operations, more staff are being provided to the Participations and Privatization Directorate and
the General Finance Inspectorate. The 2008 annual report on the economic and financial
situation of public enterprises and enterprises with public financial participation has been
issued and points to the need to ensure payment of the social security contributions to the
CNPS. At December 31, 2008, the government portfolio consisted of 31 public enterprises and
53 enterprises with public financial participation, for a consolidated capital of
CFAF 322 billion. Revenues from public enterprises and enterprises with public participation at
end-July 2009 amounted to CFAF 35.8 billion, consisting mainly of net dividends.
32.
From 2005 to 2009, several public enterprises and enterprises with public financial
participation underwent financial restructuring. The enterprises were SOTRA, BNEDT,
CECP, PALM-CI, CI-ENGINEERING, SICOGI, POSTE CÔTE D'IVOIRE, I2T, SUCRIVOIRE,
PALMAFRIQUE and SUCAF-CI. An overall strategy for public enterprise portfolio
restructuring will be presented during the first half of 2010.

73
C. Main Goals of the 2010 Budget
33.
The 2010 budget will consolidate the goals of the 2009 budget in order to accelerate
economic recovery and combat poverty. The program for 2010 is designed to: (i) achieve
real GDP growth of 4 percent; (ii) stabilize consumer price (HCPI) inflation at 3 percent; and
(iii) slightly increase the overall budget deficit (excluding grants for clearance of external
arrears) to 1.6 percent of GDP, as a result of the increase in pro-poor expenditure of 0.6 percent
of GDP and of investment financed from own resources of 0.3 percent of GDP. The
government will make every effort to diligently implement the PRSP measures and the HIPC
Initiative completion point triggers as soon as possible.
34.
Revenue collection efforts will be redoubled. The presence of the tax administration
will be strengthened in the CNW. In addition, to increase government revenue, a crisis-exit
contribution will be introduced, as of January 1, 2010, to finance the rehabilitation necessary
for economic recovery. The exemption from duties and taxes on rice will be abolished as of
January 1, 2010, in connection with the price decrease on the international market. Efforts to
combat tax evasion and fraud will continue in tax (DGI) and customs (DGD) departments, in
particular by Customs through comprehensive oversight of the entire port zone and reinforced
oversight at loading sites. These efforts will also involve strengthening risk managements and
improving valuations.
35.
The reorientation of expenditure in favor of pro-poor spending and investment
will be emphasized. To increase pro-poor spending, targeted social spending, and investment
spending, current expenditures will be restrained by decreasing the subsidy to the electricity
sector through forceful implementation of a package of measures (Box 9). In addition, the
government will endeavor to restrain the wage bill, including through the census of civil
servants and government agents and by strengthening verification of government spending on
utilities.
36.
The 2010 budget provides for an increase in investment spending, particularly on
rehabilitation of basic socio-economic infrastructure. The aim is to undertake, amongst
other things, maintenance of rural roads, improvement and upgrading of the road network,
rural electrification, and village and urban water works. In addition, the government will
continue the rehabilitation and equipment of university, school and health facilities, as well as
the implementation of programs for the development and promotion of food agriculture. The
government’s large public works will be contained at their 2009 level of CFAF 40 billion, or
0.3 percent of GDP.
37.
The government is determined to advance structural reforms in public financial
management in 2010, in particular through implementation of the PEMFAR. These will

74
continue to follow nine strategic pillars for improving public financial management. As regards
the legal and institutional framework, arrangements are being made to incorporate the
WAEMU directives on public finance. In this context, the government intends to adopt the
organic law on public finance before end-2010. In the same timeframe, it will also adopt a
decree for revising the Integrated Public Finance Management System (SIGFIP). As regards
transparency in public finance management, the functional nomenclature reflecting the
functional classification in the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001) will
be adopted and reflected in the 2012 budget. For this purpose the consolidation table linking the
Ivorian budget nomenclature and GFSM 2001 has been prepared and the glossary of types of
expenditure has been approved.

D. Monetary Policy and Financial Sector Reform
38.
Monetary policy continues to be implemented at the regional level. The government
will participate in regional liquidity management in accordance with WAEMU rules, and will
plan its issuance of securities on the regional financial and money markets according to the

76
financing needs of the budget. In this context, the government will coordinate and approve
changes to the issuance schedule each month and submit them to BCEAO for coordination with
other WAEMU zone issuance plans. Before end-2009, the government will approach the
BCEAO to seek a restructuring of arrears on the consolidated statutory overdraft. Regarding the
WAEMU’s institutional reform, the government plans to adopt the Banking Law amendments
with a view to their ratification before end-December 2009.
39.
The government will adopt additional measures to improve the management of the
government securities market. It will continue to prepare the issuance schedule and intends to
adhere to it. The Treasury Committee will regularly update the issuance schedule in the light of
monthly cash flow needs. The government will prepare on a monthly basis the cash flow plan,
followed by preparation of the issuance schedule, with a view to closing any monthly gap. In
addition, the government will enhance the reliability of cash projections, in particular through
more refined projections of domestic resources.
40.

The government also intends to follow up its efforts to help banks in distress:

-

In the case of the Banque pour le Financement de l’Agriculture (BFA), the government
will evaluate its financial situation and request an assessment mission from the Banking
Commission before end-March 2010. If its financial and prudential situation
deteriorates and no strategic partner is identified, the government will take appropriate
action. In any event, the government will not inject any new public resources in BFA.

-

As regards the viability of the bank Versus, the government will request an urgent
review by the Banking Commission in the first quarter of 2010. If the rate of recovery
of overdue debts is not satisfactory, the government will also take appropriate action. In
any event, the government will not inject any new public resources in Versus.

-

For the Banque de l’Habitat de Côte d'Ivoire (BHCI), the government will increase its
capital to CFAF 10 billion before end-2010, and will conduct a feasibility study of the
policy of housing financing. In light of the findings of this study, the government will
define its strategy towards BHCI and its role in the financing of low-cost housing.

77
Box 6: Financial System Reform Measures in 2009 and 2010
Measures

Status

Develop an action plan for the restructuring of
the National Investment Bank (BNI) on the
basis of the recommendations of the Banking
Commission and those of the financial and
operational audit before end-April 2009, and
adopt it before end-June 2009.

The action plan for the restructuring of the BNI on the basis
of the recommendations of the Banking Commission and
those of the financial and operational audit has been
adopted.
All recommendations were implemented by end-June 2009,
except for the study on the role of BNI in the financing of
the economy, which will be dealt with in the national
strategy for development of the financial sector.
In the context of the national strategy for the development
of the financial sector, the government will decide its role
in BNI, including its role in investment and financing of
agriculture. If BNI is to play a role in investment financing,
access must be made available to long-term resources.

Regarding the Postal Savings Bank (CNCE),
limit the implicit government subsidy related
to the “10-day settlements” (nivellements
décadaires) to CFAF 10 billion in 2009, in
accordance with CNCE’s change of status.

Regarding the CNCE, the implicit government subsidy was
CFAF 12.1 billion at end-June 2009. The conversion of the
CNCE into a bank was approved at the Banking
Commission’s September 2009 session. When the CNCE
has become a bank, it will be subject to prudential norms
and ratios that are applicable to other banks. Lending
operations will be strictly monitored.

41.
The government will continue financial sector reforms (Box 6). It will establish the
National Financial Sector Reform Committee before end-2009. Before June 2010, the
government will formulate a strategy for the development and rehabilitation of the financial
sector, defining the role to be played by the government. It will continue to rely on the Banking
Commission and will be guided by the FSAP recommendations. In particular, the government
will continue the restructuring of banks in distress. In order to improve the anti-money
laundering (AML) framework, the national law combating the financing of terrorism will be
adopted before end-March 2010. The National Financial Intelligence Unit (CENTIF) will
monitor compliance with the laws on financial discipline, attaching particular importance to
awareness raising and training of stakeholders, inter alia, through its website.
42.
In the context of rehabilitation of the microfinance sector, improvements have been
made in the regulatory framework, which relate in particular to:


The requirement that savings and loan mutual societies or cooperatives and approved
structures must be members of the Côte d’Ivoire Interprofessional Association of
Decentralized Financial Systems and the introduction of membership dues to that
Association;

78


The requirement that microfinance institutions which are not mutual societies must
obtain the approval of the Board of Directors for loans to executives and employees;



Limits on loans granted to executives of microfinance institutions as a function of own
funds;



In addition, the terms of reference are available for the audit of accounting, financial,
organizational and strategic reorientation of microfinance.

43.
The government is committed to rehabilitating the microfinance sector. Before
end-June 2010, the government will design and implement a plan for the rehabilitation of
microfinance institutions and will delete from the mandate of the Microfinance Directorate the
reference to the promotion of the sector, because the functions of promotion and supervision
are incompatible with one another. The government will exercise off-site supervision of
networked microfinance institutions on an individual and non-aggregated basis. In addition, the
government will strictly apply the regulatory provision making the start-up of activities
conditional on the issuance of the operating authorization and will initiate close supervision or
temporary administration of microfinance institutions.
44.
As regards pension schemes, the government will adopt the CNPS reform plan
before end-2009. For the CGRAE, the government will: (i) establish before end-2009 the
Interministerial Committee for the Reform of the Pension System; (ii) conclude the dialogue
with social partners before end-June 2010; and (iii) adopt the parametric reforms of pension
schemes, and the institutional reform, with a view to including the impact of these reforms in
the 2011 budget. The deficit of the pension operations of the CGRAE will be limited to
CFAF 30.5 billion in 2010.
E. Governance and Other Structural Reforms
45.
The government is firmly committed to advancing the process of improving
governance. A National Plan for Good Governance and Fight Against Corruption, a draft law
on unlawful enrichment, and a draft code of ethics for senior public officials are scheduled to
be adopted by the government before the first quarter of 2010. As soon as the legal framework
has been created, the government is committed to expediting the adoption of the action plans to
implement the above-mentioned reforms.
46.
The government will redouble its efforts to improve the business environment. In
2009–10, it intends to implement the following actions with the support of development
partners (Box 7).

procedure) at end-June 2009 was
CFAF 35.2 billion. A clearance plan is being
implemented to reduce the level and maintain it
under CFAF 10 billion, from end-2009.

47.
The Reform of the cocoa/coffee sector is under way in order to raise farmers’
incomes and improve transparency in the use of public resources. The lowering of taxes on
cocoa should be accompanied by support measures designed to improve farmers’ incomes in
line with the program’s pro-poor approach. In addition, budgetization of part of the levies on
the sector provided CFAF 5.1 billion for the Rural Investment Fund (Fonds d’Investissement en
Milieu Rural-FIMR) in June 2009.

80
Box 8: Reforms in the Coffee/Cocoa Sector in 2009–10
Measures

Status

Submission to the Council of Ministers within a
time lag of 45 days, and their publication, of
quarterly analytical reports on the collection and use
of coffee/cocoa levies and on the balances in the
bank accounts of the sector’s entities, as well as on
realized f.o.b export and farmgate prices.

Submissions at end-March and end-June 2009
were produced and published within the time-lag
of 45 days. The end-June submission includes the
use of operating fees for the coffee/cocoa sector.
The government is committed to continuing the
production and publication of quarterly
submissions within the same time lag and to
including in the semi-annual submissions the use
of operating fees of the coffee/cocoa sector.

Adoption of a roadmap to prepare and implement a
new strategy for the coffee/cocoa sector, comprising
a new institutional and regulatory framework, on the
basis of existing studies and audits (end-2009).

The strategy for the sector is being finalized and
should be the subject of a submission before
end-2009.

With the aim of gradually lowering total cocoa
taxation to a rate of 22 percent of the c.i.f. price in
2011, a reduction for the 2009/10 crop season of the
registration duty from 10 to 5 percent, of the single
export duty (DUS) from CFAF 220/kg to CFAF
210/kg, and of other quasi-fiscal levies of at least
CFAF 5/kg. Preparation of the transformation of
these levies to a single ad valorem tax (before the
2010/11 crop season).

The reductions of registration duties, quasi-fiscal
levies and DUS will be effective starting with the
2009/10 crop season, and work on the preparation
of an ad valorem tax is continuing. In addition,
consideration is being given to ensuring that
producers are the primary beneficiaries of the tax
relief.

48.
The efforts to improve transparency and efficiency in the energy sector should
bear fruit during 2010. The independent evaluator should finalize the reports for 2006 and
2007 in line with EITI criteria before end-2009, with a view to submitting them for validation.
The 2008 report will be finalized before end-September 2010, and the 2009 report will be
launched in 2010. As regards the electricity sector, consultations have begun with all
stakeholders, with a view to enlisting their help in reducing the deficit in the sector. They
should produce decisions no later than the first quarter of 2010. They will combine
renegotiation of the price of gas purchases with the three main operators and a revision of the
tariff structure without excluding, if necessary, further increases differentiated by category of
economic operators concerned in line with the program’s pro-poor approach. For the petroleum
subsector, the automatic adjustment mechanism for pump prices is operational. However, a
price structure review will be conducted before end-2009.

81

Box 9: Measures in the Energy Sector in 2009–10
Measures

Status

Submission to the Council of Ministers within a
time-lag of 45 days—and their publication— of
quarterly reports on: physical and financial flows in
the crude oil/gas subsector; the production, export,
and release for consumption and taxation of
petroleum products; and production, costs, and
financial flows in the electricity subsector.

The government is committed to continuing the
production and publication of the quarterly reports
within the same time lag.

Revision of the structure of petroleum product
prices based on the recommendations of the recent
distribution audit and of 2008 IMF technical
assistance (revision of cross-subsidies for transport
and butane, quasi-fiscal levies for the national
security reserve, the distribution margins, as well as
the protective margin for the refineries, before endSeptember 2009.

The automatic pricing mechanism for prices of
petroleum products has been in effect since April
2009. The price structure review is under way.

To limit the deficit of the electricity sector,
renegotiation with the gas producers of the price of
gas purchases, renegotiation of the export price of
electricity, and revision of the tariff structure before
end-June 2009; and, if necessary, increasing tariffs
before end-2009.

In order to limit the deficit of the sector, the
government: (i) has commenced renegotiation of
the price of gas purchases with operators and of
export prices; (ii) has commenced the study on the
tariff structure; and (iii) plans to reduce technical
and
non-technical losses. All these actions should be
completed before end-June 2010.

F. Regional Integration and Trade Policy
49.
The government intends to pursue its participation in regional integration within
the WAEMU and ECOWAS, as well as in world trade through the WTO. The ECOWAS
Heads of State have decided to add to their Common External Tariff (CET) a fifth tariff band
with a rate of 35 percent. Côte d’Ivoire will contribute to the identification of products to be
included in this band. In the context of the Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) with the
European Union, the signing of a interim regional EPA is planned in October 2009. On the
issue of accompanying measures, the EPA Development Program (EPADP) has been adopted
by the countries of the subregion and the Program of Support for Trade and Regional
Integration (PACIR) is being implemented. In conjunction with other countries in the subregion
and the EU, the government will continue its efforts to prepare financing programs for the
EPA.

82
G. Financing of the 2009–10 Program
50.
In spite of considerable fiscal efforts, the need to reorient expenditures and to clear
arrears generates sizable financing needs for the program period 2009–11. Taking into
account primary basic surplus, the external project financing already identified, and net
financing on the WAEMU financial market, the financing need is projected at
CFAF 2.809 trillion in 2009, and CFAF 479.9 billion in 2010. To meet these needs, the
government is benefiting from multilateral assistance and debt restructuring. Restructuring
agreements were reached with the Paris Club and London Club (preliminary), and the
government has initiated negotiations on debts to non-Paris Club bilateral creditors and other
commercial creditors (Standard Bank‒BNI and Sphynx) on terms comparable to the Paris Club.
It also hopes to obtain budget support in 2010 from multilateral institutions (IMF, World Bank,
AfDB, and EU) and bilateral partners.
51.
The government intends to raise resources on the regional financial market in 2010
for a net amount of CFAF 155 billion. After a reduction in domestic arrears/amounts payable
(restes à payer) of CFAF 67 billion in 2009, the government intends to continue this effort with
a further reduction of at least CFAF 55 billion in 2010.
V. STATISTICS AND CAPACITY-BUILDING
52.
The government undertakes to continue efforts to improve the statistical system in
order regularly to produce high-quality economic and financial data. For this purpose, the
Master Plan for Statistics 2009–13 will be adopted before end-2009 and implemented before
end-June 2010. It involves, inter alia: (i) support for national and sectoral surveys;
(ii) workshops on the introduction of the data base of the Integrated Information Management
System; (iii) revision of the Harmonized Consumer Price Index (HCPI); (iv) preparation of the
yearbook of ministerial statistical units; and (v) survey of the informal sector in Abidjan.
53.
Côte d’Ivoire will continue to strengthen its administrative capacity, especially
in areas affected by the crisis. The government will continue to receive assistance
from the IMF and other development partners to: (i) strengthen tax and customs
administration; (ii) review tax exemptions; (iii) help to implement the action plan for
public finance reform; and (iv) improve national accounts with the aim of constructing a
social accounting matrix. In order to enhance public debt management, the government
intends to implement a capacity-building program, in order to support the design and
implementation of a medium-term debt strategy. For this purpose, the government will
request IMF technical assistance.

83
VI. PROGRAM MONITORING
54.
The program will continue to be the subject of semi-annual reviews by the
IMF’s Executive Board on the basis of quantitative indicators and structural
benchmarks. These indicators, and the prior actions, are defined in the Technical
Memorandum of Understanding (TMU) of March 13, 2009 and the attached supplement. The
second program review will be based on the end-December 2009 performance criteria and is
scheduled to be completed by end-March 2010. The second year of the program will cover the
period January-December 2010, and performance criteria for June and December 2010 will be
set at the time of the second review.
55.
The government has established national frameworks for program monitoring. To
ensure that the three-year program is effectively implemented, the government has set up
several interministerial committees. The Interministerial Committee Monitoring the Economic
and Financial Program, under the aegis of the Prime Minister—created in March 2009 is
operational and is monitoring implementation of the program for 2009–11. It is assisted by the
Strategic Unit and the Technical Unit for Monitoring the Economic and Financial Program in
the day-to-day monitoring. The Committee will coordinate closely with Treasury Committee
data, the work of specific interministerial committees, amongst others, the Coffee/Cocoa Sector
Management Committee, the Interministerial Commodities Committee, and the PRSP
Committee. In addition, in order to ensure traceability in the execution of large public works,
the Interministerial Committee for Monitoring Large Works has been created. Similarly, a set
of consistent tools has been adopted to ensure expenditure execution conforming to the existing
framework. This Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies will be disseminated within
the government, government agencies, public entities, and Ivorian society.
56.
For the duration of the program, the government undertakes to refrain from
external borrowing on non-concessional terms other than specified in the TMU. For any
new domestic borrowing, it undertakes to issue government securities by auction through the
BCEAO or through any other form of competitive tendering on the domestic or WAEMU
financial market, and to consult with IMF staff. The government also undertakes not to
introduce or intensify restrictions on payments and transfers for current international
transactions, introduce multiple currency practices, conclude any bilateral payments
agreements that are inconsistent with Article VIII of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement, or
impose or intensify any import restrictions for balance of payments purposes. Moreover, the
authorities, in consultation with IMF staff, undertake to adopt any new financial or structural
measures that may be necessary for the success of the program.

ATTACHMENT II—CÔTE D’IVOIRE: SUPPLEMENT TO THE TECHNICAL MEMORANDUM OF
UNDERSTANDING
November 2, 2009
Note: this document is a supplement to the Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU)
of March 2009. That TMU remains fully valid except for the points as amended below.
Changes with respect to the original text appear in italics.
A. Overall Fiscal Balance (Including Grants) (Performance Criterion)
Paragraph 3:
The overall fiscal balance is the difference between the government’s budget revenue
(including grants other than budget support program grants from the World Bank and African
Development Bank) and total expenditure plus net lending (on a payment order basis). It
includes crisis-exit spending, which is defined as domestically and externally financed
government outlays on the national community reinsertion and rehabilitation program
(PNRRC); the redeployment of public administration; the identification process and the
elections; and the civil service.
Paragraph 5:
Part or all of the excess revenues from petroleum/gas extraction (including dividends paid by
the national petroleum corporation of Côte d’Ivoire, PETROCI, to the government) above the
programmed amount will be used to offset revenue shortfalls and/or be allocated to
“pro-poor” spending and/or to “crisis exit” spending as defined in Box 2 of the memorandum
of October 2009 and in attached Table 1, up to a cumulative maximum of CFAF 50 billion.
The floor on the overall fiscal balance will be adjusted upward by the remaining excess not
used to offset revenue shortfalls or for additional “pro-poor” spending (see Table 1). The
remainder of the excess petroleum/gas revenues will be used to reduce the government’s
domestic debt, including “balances outstanding” (see paragraphs 11–12).
Paragraph 6:
The petroleum/gas revenues estimate for 2010 is based on: an average crude oil price of
US$76.50 per barrel; a volume of 17.9 million barrels; and an average exchange rate of
CFAF 478 = US$1.

90
E. External Debt and External Payment Arrears (Performance Criterion)
The former paragraph 10 is replaced by the following:
External debt shall have the meaning set out in point 9 of the “Guidelines on Performance
Criteria with Respect to External Debt in Fund Arrangements,”(IMF Executive Board Decision
No. 12274-00/85 dated August 24, 2000). External debt is defined on the basis of residency.
However, for assessment of the program, debt issued by Ivorian entities in
CFA francs and held by residents of the member countries of the WAEMU zone shall not be
considered to be external debt.
External arrears are considered to be the nonpayment of any interest or principal amounts on
their due dates (taking into account relevant contractual grace periods, if any). This
performance criterion applies to arrears accumulated under external debt of the government
and external debt guaranteed by the government for which the guarantee has been called by
creditors, consistent with the definitions under the external debt performance criterion
(paragraph 16). This performance criterion monitored on a continuous basis.
Excluded from this performance criterion are:


Arrears accumulated under external debt contracted with official bilateral creditors
covered under the Paris Club Agreed Minute of May 2009, as well as such debts to nonParis Club bilateral official creditors that are subject to restructuring.



Arrears accumulated under:
i) the 6 series of “Brady” bonds,
ii) the BNI-Standard Bank (London) 2007 and 2008 notes,
iii) the Sphynx Capital Markets 2007 and 2008 notes, and
iv) any other debt to private creditors, for which the government has publicly
announced before completion of the first review under the PRGF arrangement for
Côte d’Ivoire that it is seeking restructurings, until the respective restructuring
agreements have been reached.
F. Balances Outstanding and Domestic Payment Arrears (Quantitative Indicator and
Performance Criterion)

Paragraph 12:
Within the framework of the program, the government, in 2009, will (i) undertake a cash
reduction of CFAF 60 billion in the stock of balances outstanding as defined in paragraph 11
(quantitative indicator) ; …

91
G. Treasury Advances (Indicative Target) and Extrabudgetary Spending (Continuous
Performance Criterion)
Paragraph 14:
Within the framework of the program, Treasury advances are defined as spending paid for by
the Treasury outside normal execution and control procedures, and which have not been subject
to prior commitment and authorization. They exclude the régies d’avances, externally-financed
expenditure, wages, subsidies and transfers, and debt service as set out through ministerial
decree. The cumulative amount of expenditures by treasury advance as defined by the program
will not exceed cumulative quarterly ceilings representing 10 percent of quarterly budget
allocations (excluding externally-financed expenditures, wages, subsidies and transfers, and
debt service) (indicative target). The nominative and restrictive list of expenditures eligible as
treasury advances is as defined by ministerial decree no. 178/MEF/CAB-01/26 of
March 13, 2009.
H. New Nonconcessional External Borrowing (Performance Criterion).
The first sentence of former paragraph 16 is deleted. One change has been made in the rest of
the paragraph:
The quantitative indicators concerning foreign borrowing apply to all nonconcessional external
debt (see paragraph 10) irrespective of maturity, and whether it has been contracted or
guaranteed by the government.

VIII. Implementation of Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI): Not Applicable
Decision point - point at which the IMF and the World Bank determine whether a country
qualifies for assistance under the HIPC Initiative and decide on the amount of assistance to
be committed.
Interim assistance - amount disbursed to a country during the period between decision and
completion points, up to 20 percent annually and 60 percent in total of the assistance
committed at the decision point (or 25 percent and 75 percent, respectively, in exceptional
circumstances).
Completion point - point at which a country receives the remaining balance of its assistance
committed at the decision point, together with an additional disbursement of interest income
as defined in footnote 2 above. The timing of the completion point is linked to the
implementation of pre-agreed key structural reforms (i.e., floating completion point).
IX.

Safeguards Assessments:

The Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) is the common central bank of the
countries of the West African Economic and Monetary Union, which includes Côte d'Ivoire.
The most recent safeguards assessment of the BCEAO was completed on November 4, 2005.
The assessment indicated progress has been made in strengthening the bank's safeguards
framework since the 2002 assessment and identified some areas where further steps would
help solidify it. An update of the assessment is in progress.
The BCEAO now publishes a full set of audited financial statements and improvements have
been made to move financial reporting closer to International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRS). Furthermore, an internal audit charter has been put in place, mechanisms for
improving risk management have been established, and follow-up on internal and external
audit recommendations has been strengthened.

3

Under the enhanced framework, an additional disbursement is made at the completion point corresponding to
interest income earned on the amount committed at the decision point but not disbursed during the interim
period.

5
The results of continuous safeguards monitoring indicate that while certain vulnerabilities
remain in internal control systems and legal structure, there has been some progress in other
areas, including through: (i) improving the external audit process by adopting a multi-year
audit program; (ii) establishing an audit committee; (iii) expanding disclosures on financial
positions of WAEMU countries with the Fund in the notes to the annual financial statements;
and (iv) further strengthening of the effectiveness of the internal audit function.
X.

Exchange Arrangements:

Côte d’Ivoire is a member of the WAEMU; the exchange system, common to all members of
the union, is free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current international
transactions. The common currency, the CFA franc, is pegged to the euro at the rate of €1 =
CFAF 655.957.
Côte d'Ivoire applies temporary restrictions relating to UN-imposed sanction, based on
WAEMU Regulation 14/2002/CM of September 2002, which provides for the enforcement
of decisions by the UNSC Sanctions Committee to freeze funds. The authorities are in the
process of notifying the Fund of these restrictions.
XI.

Article IV Consultation:

Côte d’Ivoire is on the standard 12-month Article IV consultation cycle. The Executive
Board completed the 2007 consultation on August 3, 2007.

African Development Bank Group Operations Strategy
1.
Bank Group Portfolio. Of a total of 56 operations approved since the start of AfDB
intervention in Côte d’Ivoire in 1971,4 for a net commitment of UA 1.135 million, the current
project portfolio comprises two active operations, namely (i) the Institutional and Multisector
Crisis-Exit Support Program (PAIMSC) financed with a UA 20.0 million ADF grant, and
(ii) the Economic and Financial Sector Support Program (PAREF) – a UA 83.9 million
grant-funded budgetary support program. As regards the PAIMSC, 54.6 percent of project
funds were disbursed as of 31 May 2009. It is noteworthy that several activities have already
been completed including: (i) launching the tender for equipment for students and teachers
from the Center, North and West (CNW) zone; (ii) purchasing equipment for health centers;
(iii) earmarking of the health centers to be rehabilitated; and (iv) elaborating an action plan for
capacity building to assist women who are victims of domestic violence. AfDB also approved
two emergency grants for a total of UA 1 million targeted at (i) war-affected children and
(i) the fight against the Avian Flu, respectively in September 2006 and June 2008.
2.
Portfolio management. The current projects have been seriously affected by the crisis
arising from the suspension of disbursements starting in February 2003. Following discussions
with an Ivorian delegation in Tunis in July 2004 and July 2005, the AfDB envisaged canceling
the balances of 10 operations in accordance with its procedures. However, following several
requests from the Ivorian government in 2008, the AfDB has not made any further
cancellations with a strong hope of resumption of financial cooperation with Côte d’Ivoire in
early 2009, thus freezing these operations. However, the clearance of arrears approved by the
AfDB Board in March 2009 has paved the way for a progressive re-launching of the
cooperation between AfDB and Côte d’Ivoire. A mission aimed at assessing the performance
of the on-going operations and restructuring the frozen portfolio of projects was undertaken in
June 2009.
3.
Arrears Clearance. Following the intense process of negotiation which led in March
2009 to the clearance of the arrears of the country with AfDB the Government has made
notable efforts in staying current with its maturities (see below).

Not including four projects initiated by the private sector, for a total of UA 33 million.

Strategy for reengagement by AfDB in Côte d’Ivoire. The lifting of sanctions on
the country approved by the Board of AfDB on March 6, 2009 has allowed Côte d’Ivoire to
become re-eligible to financial assistance from the AfDB under ADF 11 (2008–10). The
current AfDB’s reengagement strategy approved by its Board of Directors on March 6, 2009
focuses on contributing to help the country out of its current situation of fragility. AfDB’s
focus under the Africa Development Fund (ADF 11) (2008–10) will be to provide support to
the government for strengthening governance, including through capacity building and
developing economic infrastructure to reinforce regional integration and mitigating the
adverse impact of the civil war on the population especially in rural areas. The AfDB
reengagement strategy was approved by its Board of Directors on March 6, 2009.
Consultations between the Government and the Bank for the preparation the new Country
Strategy Paper (CSP) for the period 2011–15 will start in the second quarter of 2010. The
country will host the AfDB’s Annual Meetings in Abidjan in May 2010.

11
Côte d’Ivoire—STATISTICAL ISSUES
As of September 30, 2009
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. There are
weaknesses in the areas of national accounts and balance of payments and public finance statistics, as well as in
the reconciliation of fiscal and monetary data. Generally, the authorities provided the required statistical
indicators to the Fund (see attached table) on a timely basis.
National Accounts: Comprehensive national accounts data for 1996 onwards is compiled in line with the 1993
System of National Accounts methodologies, using 1996 as the base year. As the base year is dated, technical
assistance has been provided by AFRITAC West to implement a new base year and update implicit deflators.
Price statistics: A harmonized consumer price index (CPI) has been adopted by all WAEMU members,
although with a dated base year of 1996.
Labor market statistics: No such statistics are published regularly.
Government finance statistics: The authorities provide annual data on the budgetary central government for
publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook. While no monthly or quarterly fiscal data are
provided for publication, they are made available to the IMF African Department, although metadata is lacking.
The authorities have committed to address weaknesses in coverage of general government units and public
enterprises and are making efforts to improve the reconciliation of fiscal and monetary data.
Monetary and financial sector statistics: Monetary data for Côte d’Ivoire are prepared by the national agency
of the BCEAO and officially released by BCEAO headquarters. Some shortcomings of the monetary statistics
are common to all eight member countries of the WAEMU, while others relate to systemic issues in Côte
d’Ivoire’s bank and nonbank financing of the operations of the central government and the rest of the public
sector. Recently there have been improvements in the timeliness of reporting data on depository corporations
and interest rates. The BCEAO has also improved the estimates of currency in circulation in each WAEMU
member country by addressing the large backlog of unsorted banknotes held by the BCEAO’s national
agencies.
External sector statistics: The national agency of the BCEAO in Abidjan is responsible for compiling and
disseminating annual balance of payments statistics and the international investment position. while BCEAO
headquarters delineates the methodology and calculates international reserves managed on WAEMU countries.
With respect to merchandise trade, the customs computer system allows for satisfactory monitoring of trade
data, but the coverage of services and transfers, and particularly workers remittances, has shortcomings.
Concerning the financial accounts, foreign assets of the private nonbanking sector are not adequately covered,
while reporting of private capital flows, especially foreign direct investment in Côte d’Ivoire, is weak. There is
also not sufficient information on private debt stocks and debt service flows.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Côte d’Ivoire has participated in the General Data
Dissemination System (GDDS) since May 2000, and
has posted the metadata on the Data Standards
Bulletin Board.

No data ROSC is available.

III. Reporting to STA
Côte d’Ivoire regularly reports data to STA for re-dissemination in IMF statistical publications.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2009 Article IV Consultation with Côte d'Ivoire
On November 18, 2009, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Côte d'Ivoire.1
Background
Côte d’Ivoire, the largest economy in the West African Economic and Monetary Union
(WAEMU), is moving toward full social, political, and economic normalization. The political
crisis that began in 1999 and erupted in civil conflict in September 2002 took a heavy toll
on growth and social conditions: per capita income fell by one-sixth and by 2008 almost
half the population was living below the poverty line. Conducting the presidential election
scheduled in the near future is important to complete the political normalization and allow
the country’s economy to recover and the well-being of the population to improve.
Côte d’Ivoire has embarked on comprehensive reform policies to address the challenges
of enhancing growth and reducing poverty. It adopted a Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper
(PRSP) in February 2009, which covers the seven-year period 2009–15 and aims to
transform the country into an emerging economy. In March 2009 the IMF approved a
three-year arrangement under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) to
support the authorities’ economic program, as well as the Decision Point under the Heavily
Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds discussions with individual
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to
headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.
At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the
views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities.

2
The Ivorian economy began to pick up slowly in 2007. Growth rose to some 2.3 percent in
2008, primarily reflecting construction activity and the energy sector. Driven by high food
and fuel prices, inflation rose to a temporary spike of 9 percent in late 2008, but since
returned to its previous moderate level of around 3 percent. Economic growth is expected
to reach 3.7 percent in 2009, pushed up by oil production, agriculture and agroprocessing, and to accelerate to 4 percent in 2010 as confidence begins to return and
private investment rises. Although these levels of growth begin to reverse the decline in
per capita incomes during the internal crisis, investment levels are still low at 10 percent of
GDP—too low to meet the needs of a growing economy.
The authorities have strengthened fiscal control and the transparency of budget
implementation in recent years, while making room to increase pro-poor spending.
Significant revenue efforts have facilitated an increase in spending for urgent needs.
However, there are risks to fiscal stability related, among other factors, to the electricity
subsidy and accumulated unpaid wage commitments.
The external current account (including official transfers) has strengthened significantly
reflecting a 30 percent increase in cocoa prices since 2007 as well as strong oil production
and prices. At the same time, the authorities regularized the country’s high external
arrears through debt restructuring agreements with Paris Club and, on a preliminary basis,
with London Club creditors. Gross official reserves are projected to rise to over 4 months
of import cover in 2009.
Transparency and governance in the cocoa and energy sectors are being improved.
Reforms are also under way to strengthen public financial management, including
procurement and tax administration; to tackle financial sector challenges, judicial reform,
and other structural impediments that weigh on the business climate.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended Côte d’Ivoire’s progress in strengthening macroeconomic
management and improving the fiscal position and public financial management. Higher
growth and lower inflation, helped by favorable terms of trade and political normalization,
have helped arrest the severe deterioration in social indicators resulting from
Côte d’Ivoire’s sociopolitical crisis. Near-term economic prospects appear favorable,
although many challenges still lie ahead, and continued donor assistance will be needed
to support the authorities’ reform efforts.
Directors welcomed the achievement of a primary budget surplus. However, continued
current spending pressures arise from the electricity subsidy, large contingent wage
commitments, and discretionary spending. Directors underscored that fiscal consolidation
remains critical to expand the fiscal space gained from the reforms and political
normalization. They welcomed the authorities’ commitment to begin winding down
crisis-exit spending and the emphasis on pro-poor and investment outlays in the
draft 2010 budget.

3
Directors welcomed the significant progress made in clearing external arrears and
normalizing relations with external creditors, including with the Paris Club and the
preliminary restructuring agreement with Brady bond holders on comparable terms. They
encouraged the authorities to pursue their discussions with a view to reach a similar
agreement with other creditors. Directors looked forward to adequate internal coordination
to prevent a recurrence of arrears to multilateral creditors, and supported the authorities’
request for technical assistance on public debt management.
Directors supported the authorities’ efforts to strengthen tax and customs administration,
reduce domestic arrears, and improve fiscal transparency, including in large public works.
They called for strong implementation of the plans to improve public resource
management and to continue reorienting spending to areas critical to reducing poverty and
improving infrastructure. They also looked forward to the establishment of a National
Procurement Regulation Authority, reforms in the pension funds and the civil service, a
strategy for a sustainable wage bill, and the restructuring of the electricity sector.
Directors noted the staff’s assessment that Côte d’Ivoire’s real effective exchange rate
appears to be in line with fundamentals. Nonetheless, the export base is narrow and the
business climate needs to be improved. Directors therefore encouraged the authorities to
vigorously pursue structural reforms and integrate Côte d’Ivoire more closely with its
neighbors to bolster efficiency and create new export opportunities. Priorities include
further reducing the taxation of cocoa income, reforming the cocoa sector institutions,
improving transparency in the energy sector, and judicial reforms. Directors looked
forward to the adoption of the National Plan for Good Governance and Fight Against
Corruption.
Directors urged the authorities to address financial sector vulnerabilities identified by
the 2009 FSAP. In particular, they underscored the need to improve the solvency and
asset quality of some local banks, reduce connected lending and loan concentration, and
rehabilitate microfinance institutions. They encouraged the authorities to resolve problem
banks without recourse to public funds and to support the Banking Commission in
ensuring bank compliance with prudential norms. Directors welcomed the authorities’
plans to establish a National Financial Sector Reform Committee and to formulate a
Financial Sector Development Strategy, which will clarify the government’s role in the
financial system.

IMF Executive Board Completes First Review Under Côte d'Ivoire’s PRGF
Arrangement, Approves US$57.3 Million Disbursement
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) completed today the first
review of Côte d’Ivoire’s economic performance under a three-year Poverty Reduction and
Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement. With the completion of the review, Côte d’Ivoire may
request an SDR 35.772 million disbursement (about US$57.3 million) This will bring total
disbursements under the program to SDR 195.12 million (about US$312.5 million).
Côte d'Ivoire’s PRGF arrangement was approved in March 2009 (see Press Release
No. 09/96) in the total amount of SDR 373.98 million.
In completing the review, the Executive Board also granted two waivers of non-observance
of the performance criteria on the overall fiscal balance and on the non-accumulation of new
external payment arrears. The Executive Board also completed the financing assurances
review.
Following the Executive Board’s discussion of Côte d’Ivoire’s performance,
Mr. John Lipsky, First Deputy Managing Director and Acting Chair, stated:
“The Ivorian authorities are to be commended for their satisfactory performance under the
PRGF-supported program and progress toward political normalization. They achieved a
primary budget surplus and made significant progress in normalizing relations with external
creditors despite the global economic crisis and the difficult post-conflict environment.
Helped by favorable terms of trade, Côte d’Ivoire’s economy is recovering, and, although
significant challenges remain, near-term economic prospects are favorable.
“Continued fiscal consolidation is critical to expand the fiscal space gained from the reforms
and political normalization. The authorities aim to improve public resource management and
to continue reorienting spending to areas critical to reducing poverty and improving

2
infrastructure. To address the large accumulated wage commitments, the authorities are
committed to implement a major civil service reform in 2010 and adopt a strategy for a
sustainable medium-term wage bill. They will also address the rising deficits of both the
pension funds and the electricity sector.
“Determined structural reforms coupled with further regional integration are needed to
address the weak external competitiveness. The authorities will further reduce the taxation of
cocoa income, reform the institutional and regulatory framework in the cocoa sector,
advance restructuring in the electricity sector, and enhance the efficiency and fairness of the
judicial system.
“Reforms in the financial sector aim to strengthen the prudential and supervisory framework
and clarify the government’s role in the financial system.
The international community’s assistance remains crucial for Côte d’Ivoire’s full political
normalization and economic success,” Mr. Lipsky said.
Côte d’Ivoire, which became of member of the IMF in March 1963, has a quota in the Fund
amounting to SDR 325.20 million (about US$520.8 million).

Statement by Laurean Rutayisire, Executive Director for Côte d'Ivoire
November 18, 2009
My Ivorian authorities are thankful for the fruitful dialogue they have had with staff during
their September 2009 mission in Abidjan. The discussions in the context of the Article IV
consultation paired with the first review of the PRGF arrangement set the stage for a broad
overview of Côte d’Ivoire’s achievements over the past period and the challenges still facing
a post conflict economy. My authorities broadly share the thrust of the staff report as a fair
transcription of their discussions and have consented to its publication.
My Ivorian authorities would also like to express their gratitude to the Executive Board and
Management for the continuous support that has helped the country weather the impact of an
internal crisis worsened by a gloomy international environment of food and fuel crisis and
global slowdown. My authorities would specially like to place on the record their
appreciation of the Managing Director’s trip to Abidjan in May 2009, as a unique
opportunity that contributed to improve the mutual understanding of key cooperation matters.
By meeting with various stakeholders, including major political leaders, private sector actors
and civil society, the MD not only witnessed the renewed commitment of my authorities to
sound management and reforms, but also had a first-hand experience of the populations’
expectations from the recently approved PRGF and the HIPC process.
Since the approval of the 2009-11 PRGF and the attainment of the HIPC decision point in
March 2009, my Ivorian authorities have made significant progress both on the political and
economic fronts. The consolidation of peace, the reunification of the country and the overall
political normalization are heading to the final step of presidential elections. All signs point
to the assessment of economic recovery taking hold. Output growth is projected to accelerate
to 3.7 percent in 2009, after barely reaching 2 percent in 2006-08 and recording negative data
over the worst years of the crisis. With the HIPC decision point, the government has made
good progress in negotiations with its creditors, and remains committed to the goal of
reaching the completion point within one year. My authorities have also posted strong results
in fiscal consolidation, governance and structural reforms in key economic sectors. They are
committed to stepping up effort in fostering growth by creating a peaceful environment
conducive to private sector activity, and reducing poverty.
I.

Recent Developments and Program Performance

Signs of political normalization and economic recovery
Over the recent period, my authorities have enhanced the political environment as the basis
for economic recovery. The peace roadmap set forth under the March 2007 Ouagadougou
Accord is at its final step that is the presidential election. Voter registration is completed and
the electoral list is available for consultation to all enrollees via internet and other sources,

2
since November 13, 2009. A one-month period has been allotted for all disputes prior to the
finalization of the list. On this basis, the date for the ballots will be announced in the coming
days by my authorities.
The political normalization has given momentum to the domestic growth engines.
Agriculture, especially food production performed well, as did transport and
telecommunications, agro processing, mining, refining, and chemical industry activity. In
addition, the global crisis has had little impact on Côte d’Ivoire so far, and the country has
benefited from some favorable terms of trade since 2007, especially high cocoa prices. As a
result, output is projected to grow by 3.7 percent in 2009. Inflation is back to the 3 percent
regional standard, after a temporary spike at year-end 2008, stemming from high world food
prices and adjustments in domestic petroleum prices. The favorable terms of trade have
yielded an external current account surplus that is projected to reach 2.7 percent of GDP in
2009.
Program performance
Under a benign macroeconomic situation, my authorities’ program implementation at the end
of June 2009 was broadly on track as assessed by staff. In the fiscal area, the authorities
continued their effort of fiscal consolidation. The fiscal deficit was substantially on target,
with revenues overperforming by ½ percent of GDP, mainly due to cocoa export duties, tax
revenue from oil, and VAT revenue. Expenditures were kept in check, despite some minor
overruns on the electricity subsidy and the wage bill. My authorities’ ongoing endeavor on a
balanced electricity sub-sector and on a medium-term sustainable wage bill should help
further fiscal consolidation. My authorities have also cleared important stocks of domestic
arrears, net repayment on a cash basis amounting to CFAF 52.7 billion (0.5 percent of GDP).
As further signs of an improved PFM, my Ivorian authorities would also like to place on the
record the full resumption of budgetary processes and the end of a number of practices that
occurred under the crisis. The government does not have recourse any more to uncontrolled
treasury advances, costly short term financing, and early tax collection. Moreover, the
financing of the large public works related to the transfer of the capital city is now limited to
the budget envelope, and transparency has improved on this issue.
My authorities have made good progress on structural reforms, including in the areas of
PFM and key sectors of cocoa/coffee and oil. The implementation of the ambitious PFM
action plan designed with the assistance of the World Bank has begun. Since April 2009, the
government has been implementing the automatic petroleum pricing mechanism. A census
of civil servants is being finalized, as the major first step of the reform of the civil service. In
the cocoa sector, quasi-fiscal levies have been reduced with the view to ensuring a more
remunerative price for producers, and my authorities have set mechanisms to enhance
transparency in the management of these funds. A reform committee is working
expeditiously to propose a new operational framework for the sector. Other reforms are
proceeding well, including the restructuring of public financial institutions.

3
II.

Challenges Ahead and Medium-Term Policies

While assessing the important inroads made in emerging from sociopolitical crisis,
embarking on a PRGF-supported program and reaching the HIPC decision point, my
authorities are fully cognizant of the challenges ahead, especially the daunting task of posting
stronger economic results capable of reducing poverty. With an improved outlook, my
authorities are projecting a sustained real GDP growth reaching 4 percent in 2010, inflation
stabilized at 3 percent and the overall budget surplus (excluding grants for clearance of
external arrears) to increase to 1.6 percent of GDP. The authorities plan a full range of
structural reforms that should help close the output gap, post-crisis, and help unleash the full
potential of the economy.
Fiscal policy
My authorities are committed to continue their effort of fiscal consolidation, through the
rationalization of crisis-exit spending and the prioritization of productive expenditures. In
that regard, though the 2010 budget still bears the burden of some government wage
commitments made under the crisis, it mainly focuses on pro-poor spending which increases
by 0.6 percent of GDP and infrastructure investments. To boost revenue, my authorities have
taken a number of measures that will bear fruits in 2010. Tax and customs administrations
are being strengthened, and additional receipts should come from formerly uncovered CNW
zones. The tax exemptions on rice imports, which were introduced in 2008 as a response to
the food crisis has recently been revoked. In the same vein, the supplementary income tax for
reconstruction was reintroduced. On the expenditure side, my authorities are mindful of the
unsustainable pressure the wage bill puts on the budget. That is why, for the medium term,
they are working on a comprehensive strategy to curb the wage bill. More broadly, the
implementation of the PFM action plan will be enhanced with the view to improving
expenditure management and treasury operations. A new public procurement code has been
adopted in August 2009. The establishment of a National Procurement Regulation Authority
should follow in the coming weeks and will help strengthen public procurement, by
separating the regulatory, executive, and control functions.
Monetary and Financial sector policies
Over the last period, my authorities have stepped up their issuance of securities on the
regional financial and money markets to finance their budget needs. They intend to improve
their management of the government securities market and participate in regional efforts
within the WAEMU to enhance this financing tool. Regarding the financial sector, my
authorities will establish the National Financial Sector Reform Committee before end-2009.
Aided by the recommendations of the recent FSAP and the work of the committee, my
authorities will formulate, before June 2010, a Financial Sector Development Strategy
(FSDS), defining the role to be played by the state in this sector. In the meantime, actions are
proceeding regarding a number of institutions. The restructuring of BNI is on track, the

4
postal saving bank (CNCE) has been granted the bank status by the banking commission in
September 2009. The restructuring of banks in distress – BFA, Versus Bank, BHCI - is also
continuing, with the clear principle that in any event, the government will not inject any new
public resources in those institutions. The government intends to implement a plan for
rehabilitating the microfinance sector that has proved an effective financial tool for important
segments of the population. My authorities are also committed to combat money laundering
and the financing of terrorism. The antimoney laundering framework will be improved
accordingly by the adoption before end-March 2010 of the national law combating the
financing of terrorism.
Governance and other structural reforms
Cognizant of the legacy of the civil conflict, especially as regards citizens’ attitude vis-à-vis
public resources, my authorities are firmly committed to enhance policies and mechanisms to
improve governance. A National Plan for Good Governance and Fight against Corruption, a
draft law on unlawful enrichment and a draft code of ethics for senior public officials are
scheduled to be adopted by the government before the first quarter of 2010.
In addition to structural reforms already envisaged in the fiscal, financial and cocoa/coffee
sectors, my authorities also plan a number of actions in the energy sector and the business
environment. On the energy sector, after adopting the automatic pricing mechanism, the
deficit in the electricity sub sector is the remaining source of government subsidy. The
authorities launched a series of consultations with all actors, with the view to finding a
lasting scenario for the financial balance of the sector.
My authorities intend to enhance the role of the private sector as the key engine of growth, in
the post crisis period, more than in the past. In that regard, they pay a special attention to the
reforms that have an impact on the business climate. The work underway in the energy sector
is expected to yield results in terms of lowering production costs for enterprises. In the
reform of public procurement, one of my authorities’ objectives is to create more
transparency around public bids and give equal opportunities to private sector actors.
Another array of measures to be stressed relates to the judiciary system. Most of my
authorities’ reforms in this area are underway and the deadlines for adoption and
implementation evolve around the first quarter of 2010. The key ones are a reform plan to
enhance the efficiency and fairness of the judicial system, a reform of the law on
competition, notably to combat noncompetitive practices, the creation of commercial courts
and training of judiciary staff in commercial matters, and a decree on enforcement of
decisions of Arbitration Boards, thereby expediting the resolution of business disputes and
helping to unclog the courts.

5
PRSP and HIPC process
My authorities are committed to implementing their poverty reduction strategy to turn around
the upward trends taken by the poverty profile over the past years. Along with their efforts to
weather the impact of the conflict, and consistent with the country’s I-PRSP, the authorities
have increased their outlays in poverty reduction and initiated many actions in social sectors.
The institutional framework to implement the PRSP has been put in place all over the
territory and is carrying out its tasks. The government is committed to monitoring the
execution of pro-poor spending in the 2010 budget, as it moves on the other triggers of the
HIPC floating completion point. My authorities are also stepping up negotiations with
commercial creditors, after favorably concluding talks with Paris Club members.
Conclusion
My Ivorian authorities viewed the conclusion of a new PRGF-supported program and the
reaching of the decision point at the end of the first quarter of 2009, as an important
milestone in their effort towards crisis exit and the restoration of economic normalcy.
Moreover, my authorities consider the huge expectations that arose from this juncture as a
call for action, both from them and from their development partners whose support has
contributed to this achievement. My authorities have since then enhanced their efforts in
political normalization, macroeconomic management and structural reforms, and
consequently posted a satisfactory performance over the first semester of the program. Still,
the challenges ahead are commensurate and, as in any post conflict society, the government
faces competing demands with a weakened institutional apparatus and scarce resources. My
authorities believe that with the support of the international community, their policies set
forth for the period ahead will help Côte d’Ivoire rebound for the good of its population and
for the whole West African sub-region. This requires a smooth implementation of the
program and the HIPC completion point triggers. In that endeavor, my authorities would like
to request the Board support for the conclusion of the 2009 Article IV consultation, the
conclusion of the first review under the PRGF arrangement, and for waiver of nonobservance
of performance criteria and financing assurances review.
