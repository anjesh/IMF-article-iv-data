STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
AND FIRST POST-PROGRAM MONITORING DISCUSSIONS

KEY ISSUES
Context: Moldova largely achieved the main objectives of the combined ECF/EFF supported
program that expired on April 30, 2013. The economy has strongly recovered from the
drought-related contraction in 2012 but will slow down in 2014. Key risks to the near-term
outlook relate to financial stability, fiscal policy slippages in the run up to the
2014 parliamentary elections, a further slowdown in activity in main trading partners, and
intensification of geopolitical tensions.
Financial sector policies: Corporate governance in the banking sector is a major concern. In
line with FSAP recommendations, significant weaknesses in the legal and regulatory
frameworks must be urgently addressed to ensure stability and soundness of the financial
sector.
Fiscal policy: Moldova has achieved a substantial degree of fiscal consolidation in recent
years, but this trend is now reversing. Resisting pre-election pressures for selective spending
increases and returning to the path of fiscal consolidation would reduce reliance on
exceptionally-high donor support. Structural fiscal reforms would help safeguard
sustainability.
Monetary and exchange rate policy: Monetary policy has been successful in maintaining
inflation within the NBM’s target range. Going forward, the NBM needs to remain ready to
adopt a tightening bias if inflationary pressures start emerging. There is room to strengthen
the inflation targeting regime.
Structural reforms: The implementation of structural reforms outlined in the National
Development Strategy (NDS) Moldova 2020—especially in the business environment, physical
infrastructure, and human resources development areas—would help boost potential growth
and reduce poverty.

CONTEXT
1.
Moldova’s remarkable recovery from the severe recession of 2009 was largely the
result of sound macroeconomic and financial policies and structural reforms. Despite a small
contraction in 2012, Moldova’s economic performance was among the strongest in the region
during 2010–13. Economic activity grew cumulatively by about 24 percent; consumer price inflation
was brought under control; and real wages increased cumulatively by about 13 percent. This
expansion was made possible by adequate macroeconomic stabilization measures and ambitious
structural reforms implemented in the wake of the crisis under a Fund-supported program (Box 1).
In November 2013, Moldova initialed an Association Agreement with the EU which includes
provisions establishing a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA).
2.
A political crisis in early 2013 led to policy slippages in the fiscal and financial areas.
The political crisis that broke out in early 2013 was resolved with the appointment of a government
supported by a pro-European center-right/center coalition in May 2013. However, delays in policy
implementation prevented completion of the final reviews under the ECF/EFF arrangements.
Parliamentary elections are scheduled for late 2014 and local elections for early 2015. The elections
are expected to be highly contested.
3.
Despite a sharp decline in poverty in recent years, Moldova remains one of the poorest
countries in Europe and structural reforms are needed to promote sustainable growth. Based
on the Europe and Central Asia (ECA) regional poverty line of US$5/day (PPP), 55 percent of the
population was poor in 2011. While this was significantly lower than 94 percent in 2002, Moldova’s
poverty rate is still more than double the ECA average of 25 percent. The NDS—Moldova 2020,
which was published in November 2012, focuses on several critical areas to boost economic
development and reduce poverty.1 These include education, infrastructure, financial sector, business
climate, energy consumption, pension system, and judicial framework.

1

The NDS (EBD/13/52) and the associated IMF-World Bank Joint Staff Advisory Note (EBD/13/53) were circulated to
the Boards of the IMF and World Bank on August 1, 2013.

Box 1. Implementation of Past IMF Policy Recommendations
In the last few years, in the context of a Fund program, Moldova established a solid track record of
implementing Fund advice. In particular, a significant fiscal adjustment aimed at restoring
sustainability was achieved, inflation has been kept under control, and structural reforms were
advanced. The record has been weaker regarding implementation of advice related to the banking
sector, including the past FSAP advice. Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance, and
Moldova subscribes to the SDDS.
2010-13: Extended Credit Facility (ECF)/Extended Fund Facility (EFF) 1
The ECF/EFF supported program was implemented broadly on schedule with the timely completion
of the first five reviews. Although the last program review was not completed due to disagreements
on fiscal and financial sector policies, the central program objectives were achieved. The overall
budget deficit was reduced from 6.3 percent of GDP in 2009 to 2.2 percent of GDP in 2012, and
government debt was brought to about 30 percent of GDP. The relatively elevated inflation was
brought to the mid-single digits in the context of the introduction of an inflation targeting regime.
International reserves were rebuilt. Structural reforms were advanced in several areas, such as
energy, education, social assistance, and the financial sector.
2012: Article IV Consultation
Since the last Article IV consultation in 2012, macroeconomic policies and structural reforms have
been broadly in line with Fund recommendations whereas implementation of advice on financial
sector reforms has been weak. The overall budget deficit has remained on a declining trend but
mostly as a result of the under-execution of investment projects, while measures adopted during
last year’s political crisis increased current spending. The NBM’s monetary policy stance has
remained appropriate, which helped to keep inflation within the NBM’s target range and increase
international reserves. Financial stability has been preserved, although the condition of Banca de
Economii (BEM) continued to deteriorate and subsequent steps to stabilize its financial situation
were not in line with Fund’s advice. Amendments to the Law on Financial Institutions were passed in
line with Fund program understandings. However, implementation has been slow, in part because of
legal challenges.
1

Approved in January 2010, the ECF/EFF was supported by access totaling SDR 369.6 million (300 percent of quota) split equally
between the two facilities. The actually disbursed amount was SDR 320 million (around US$500 million). The program expired in
April 2013. On August 28, 2013, the Executive Board adopted a decision expecting Moldova to engage in Post-Program Monitoring
(PPM) with the Fund.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS, OUTLOOK, AND
RISKS
4.
The Moldovan economy has strongly recovered from the drought-related contraction
in 2012 (Figures 1–4). Following a decline of 0.7 percent in 2012, the economy expanded by
8.9 percent in 2013, led by strong rebound in agriculture and related industries, private consumption
and exports. Inflation remained within the NBM’s target range of 5 percent ± 1.5 percentage points.
The overall budget deficit narrowed to 1.8 percent of GDP in 2013 from 2.2 percent of GDP in 2012,
partly reflecting the under execution of investment projects. The external accounts continued to
improve, with the current account deficit narrowing to about 5½ percent of GDP, reflecting strong
export performance, contained import growth, and still strong inflow of remittances. International
reserves increased to US$2.8 billion (5 months of imports or 105 percent of short-term debt). The
real effective exchange rate (REER) depreciated by 3½ percent. Although estimates point to possible
modest overvaluation of the real exchange rate, external competitiveness appears broadly adequate
as reflected in strong sustained export performance (Annex I).
5.
However, the near-term economic outlook is weak. In 2014, output growth is expected
to moderate to 2¼ percent, mainly due to a slowdown in agriculture and related industries and
weaker economic activity in main trading partners (in particular Russia and Ukraine). Inflation is
projected to remain stable at about 5¼ percent with the impact of the recent depreciation of the leu
being offset by delays in adjusting utility prices. The current account deficit is projected to widen to
about 7½ percent of GDP, resulting from a slowdown in export growth and a decline in remittances,
following the completion of construction projects relating to the Sochi Olympic Games in Russia.
6.
Domestic and external risks are to the downside. Main risks to the near-term outlook
relate to serious vulnerabilities and governance issues in the banking sector, policy slippages in the
run up to the elections, intensification of geopolitical tensions in the region (Box 2), and a further
slowdown in activity in main trading partners (see Risk Assessment Matrix). Moldova remains highly
vulnerable to fluctuations in remittances from workers abroad (24 percent of GDP), exports to the
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and European Union (EU) (88 percent of total exports),
and donor support (about 10 percent of government spending). The main transmission channels
through which adverse exogenous shocks could impact the Moldovan economy are: remittances
(also due to potentially returning migrants), external trade, and capital flows. Staff’s spillover analysis
suggests that further strengthening of fiscal and external buffers would be critical for mitigating the
impact of external shocks, particularly in light of the Moldova’s strong links and synchronized
business cycle with trading partners (Annex II).

Authorities’ views
7.
The authorities had divergent views on the short-term outlook and the possible
impact of recent geopolitical tensions in the region. The Ministry of Economy (MoE) argued that
it was premature to reassess the near-term outlook due the lack of new data. Under some scenarios
6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF MOLDOVA

Moldova could benefit from geopolitical developments and growth could be even higher than the
4 percent assumed in the budget. In contrast, the NBM expressed concerns about the slowdown in
the Russian economy, the latest data on remittances, and the outlook for agriculture. In their view
output in 2014 is likely to be flat or decline. Consequently, the NBM’s inflation projections, in
particular, for the second half of the year are lower than the staff’s projections. The authorities
agreed that, on balance, risks to the outlook are to the downside, and on the transmission channels
and policy responses as outlined in the Risk Assessment Matrix.
Box 2. Potential Impact on Moldova from Recent Regional Geopolitical Tensions
The impact of recent regional geopolitical developments on the Moldovan economy will depend on whether the
crisis spreads beyond Ukraine, trade tensions with Russia escalate, and trade routes and gas supply are
disrupted. The impact would be partly mitigated if donors support were to increase. An adequate policy
response would require facilitating the absorption of the external shock in the near term and increased
integration into global trade and energy markets over the medium term.
The direct impact of the economic crisis in Ukraine on the Moldovan economy is likely to be fairly
limited due to the modest trade and financial linkages. Ukraine’s share of Moldovan exports is about
6 percent and remittances from Ukraine represent around 1 percent of GDP. On the financial side the direct
impact would be negligible due to the very limited cross-border financial relations.
A further slowdown in the Russian economy and/or an escalation of trade tensions with Russia would
have a significant impact on Moldova. Russia’s share of Moldovan exports is about 26 percent and
remittances from Russia represent about 15 percent of Moldova’s GDP. Furthermore, the Moldovan banking
system is heavily reliant on funding from Russian banks. A disruption on interbank funding from Russian
banks to Moldovan banks could significantly destabilize the already fragile banking system. In addition,
Russia is an important source of FDI to Moldova (about 10 percent of the total stock of FDI).
A disruption of trade routes and gas supply can severely impact the economy. The CIS’s share in
Moldovan exports is about 40 percent and all land routes to CIS countries pass through Ukraine. Similarly,
Moldova is heavily reliant on Russian gas transported via pipelines in Ukraine (over 90 percent of total gas
consumption). There are limited options in the short term to substitute gas imports from Russia.
An adequate policy response and additional donor support would help mitigate the impact of this
shock. In the near term, prudent macroeconomic policies could help the absorption of the shock, including
by letting the exchange rate adjust and allowing automatic stabilizers work in full, ideally in the context of
additional donor support. Policies to facilitate the absorption of returning migrants into the local labor
market will also be important. Over the medium term, increased integration into global trade and energy
markets would help reduce the impact of shocks in any single trading partner.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Maintaining Financial System Stability
Staff’s views
8.
Risks to systemic financial stability are significant due to governance problems in the
banking system. Although indicators show that banks are well capitalized, profitable, and liquid,
though the share of nonperforming loans (NPLs) remains relatively high (Table 5) significant risks
exist suggesting that cautious reliance should be placed on the indicators.2 There are indications of
active concealment of banks ultimate beneficial owners and controllers. Some ultimate beneficial
owners may be able to disguise their control in order to circumvent NBM’s vetting process and to
conceal related party lending. There are also concerns that reported liquid assets of some banks
may actually be encumbered, which would make the actual liquidity ratios worse than reported. Staff
urged the authorities to implement the FSAP recommendations, in particular those related to
enforcement of regulatory requirements (Annex III).
9.
The ability of regulators to take action is constrained. A Constitutional Court (CC) ruling
issued last year substantially reduced the powers of the NBM by authorizing any court to suspend
decisions of the NBM (except the ones on liquidation of banks and cancelation of licenses) until the
end of the court process. In December, Parliament approved legislation that addressed the
implications of the CC ruling on NBM decisions with a more specific focus on those related to
monetary and exchange rate policies. The NBM’s independence to effectively carry out most of its
functions as bank supervisor remains to be fully restored. A separate CC ruling limits the
independence and effective operation of the National Commission for Financial Markets (supervisor
of nonbank financial institutions). Staff underscored the importance of respecting the independence
of regulators from political interference and advised to urgently pass legislation to fully restore the
NBM and NCFM’s regulatory powers. Legal protection of board members and employees of these
agencies should also be strengthened. In turn, these agencies need to resolutely enforce regulatory
requirements. In particular, the NBM must re-evaluate bank shareholders to ensure disclosure of
ultimate beneficial owners and controllers. Staff noted that enforcement of the AML/CFT framework
needs to be strengthened.
10.
The condition of BEM, the fourth largest bank with an extensive branch network, and
two mid-sized banks believed to be affiliated remains fragile. These three banks, which
combined comprise 28 percent of banking system assets, equivalent to about 20 percent of GDP,
2

In March 2014, the aggregate capital adequacy ratio stood at 23.5 percent, above the required minimum of
16 percent. Banking sector profitability was good with return on equity at 8.6 percent and liquidity remained high
with liquid assets representing 34.7 percent of total assets. The resolution of NPLs has been relatively slow as banks
have been reluctant to write-off bad loans due to problems with the repossession and sale of collateral. The NPL
ratio stands at 13.2 percent.

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF MOLDOVA

have large interbank exposures among themselves and also large exposures to several Russian
banks. Staff recommended that the NBM maintain a high level of scrutiny of BEM’s operations, and
monitor developments in liquidity indicators in these banks on a daily basis, including interbank
exposures. Welcoming the launch of a diagnostic study of BEM’s financial situation by an external
auditor, staff stressed the importance of ensuring that BEM shareholders and management
cooperate fully with the auditor. Staff noted that despite the dilution of the government’s share
following its recapitalization in August 2013, the Ministry of Finance needs to ensure strong
representation at the BEM’s board in order to safeguard public interest given that the government
still owns 33 percent of this systemically-important bank that has large public sector deposits. Staff
advised to initiate inspections in the other two banks without delay and, in due course, carry out an
assessment of the financial situation in all other banks. Any bank found in breach of regulatory
requirements based on these studies should expeditiously submit time-bound plans to address any
shortcomings. In addition, staff recommended that the NBM limit deposit growth in banks paying
above-market deposit rates to attract depositors and banks that may experience significant
problems, for example by requiring these banks to pay a higher deposit insurance premium. Staff
also recommended that the government refrain from providing additional privileged access of
public sector deposits to some banks. As the situation permits, the government should gradually
transfer public sector deposits from commercial banks to the NBM.
11.
Staff urged the authorities to develop contingency plans in line with best international
practice. Staff noted that it was especially important to improve the coordination between the
various authorities (especially NBM and MoF), and to close gaps in the statutory powers required for
least-cost bank resolution (for example, there is no statutory power for the government to provide
funding or guarantees quickly). Staff urged the authorities to put in place a process of regular
inter-agency cooperation. Staff noted that the deposit insurance framework would benefit from
enhancements in several areas, particularly getting greater assurance in the provision of back-up
funding and better information sharing between the Deposit Guarantee Fund and NBM.

Authorities’ views
12.
The authorities shared staff’s concerns regarding governance in the banking system
and agreed on the importance of having independent financial regulators. They agreed on the
importance of implementing some of the FSAP recommendations, in particular on the need to pass
legislation to fully restore the regulatory powers of the NBM and the NCFM. More generally, the
NBM has prepared a draft action plan for implementing the FSAP recommendations and is awaiting
reactions from other stakeholders. However, there was no consensus among the authorities on
other key recommendations, for instance on the adequate degree of legal protection of NBM staff.
13.
The authorities agreed with staff’s views regarding BEM’s financial situation and that
of banks believed to be affiliated to it but had divergent views on the way forward. They
agreed with the recommendation of maintaining a high level of scrutiny of these banks, which—
according to the NBM—has already been in effect in recent months. They agreed that, despite some
delays, the external auditor’s diagnostic study of BEM will provide a good basis to request BEM’s

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

9

REPUBLIC OF MOLDOVA

shareholders to put in place a plan to become compliant with regulatory requirements. In contrast
with staff views, the authorities considered that shareholders should be given ample time to come
up with a solution. There was some disagreement among the authorities on the design of a
contingency framework, including with regard to which institution—the government or the NBM—
should shoulder any costs arising from bank resolution or recapitalization.

B. Safeguarding Fiscal Sustainability
Staff’s views
14.
Moldova has achieved an impressive degree of fiscal consolidation in recent years, but
fiscal discipline has weakened recently and public debt is again on an upward trend. The
overall budget deficit excluding grants was reduced from 8.4 percent of GDP in 2009 to 3.9 percent
in 2012. In 2013, fiscal consolidation efforts waned and the deficit excluding grants remained
broadly unchanged despite a significant under execution of investment projects and buoyant
revenues on the back of strong growth. In 2014-15 a significant deterioration in the fiscal position is
projected—with the budget deficit excluding grants widening to 5½ percent of GDP and
6½ percent, respectively—reflecting significant wage and pension increases (in addition to those
granted last year in the midst of the political crisis), the cost of new ad hoc tax benefits, a
normalization in the execution of investment projects, and weaker economic activity. As a result
public and publicly guaranteed is debt is projected to increase to 41½ percent of GDP in 2019 from
30 percent in 2013.

1/ Structural fiscal balances and the output gap are expressed in percent of potential GDP. Due to data limitations and rapidly changing structure of the
economy and fiscal parameters, estimates of the output gap and structural budget balances should be treated cautiously.
2/ Fiscal impulse is defined as the change in the structural primary balance including grants in percent of potential GDP.

15.
Debt sustainability analysis indicates that there is no room to deviate from prudent
policies and reliance on exceptionally high external assistance represents a vulnerability. Staff
noted that while the relatively low level of public debt makes the current deficit level sustainable in
the near term, the updated debt sustainability analysis (DSA) indicates that public debt remains

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF MOLDOVA

vulnerable to shocks, including the potential recapitalization needs of the banking system (See Debt
Sustainability Analysis). Staff recommended reducing the budget deficit to a level sustainable
without recourse to exceptionally high official assistance. 3 In particular, as a medium-term objective,
the authorities should aim at reducing the budget deficit excluding grants to about 2½ percent of
GDP (consistent with an overall budget deficit of 1½ percent) over the medium term. This would put
government debt as share of GDP on a downward trajectory, be consistent with the projected
financing availability, and prevent permanent expenditure increases that were financed in the near
term by temporary donor support.

Staff recommended gradual adjustment to achieve the medium fiscal objective. Staff
advised to allow automatic stabilizers operate in case revenues turn out lower than projected due to
the weaker economic outlook, but to strictly adhere to the expenditure ceiling in the 2014 budget,
especially by refraining from granting wage and pension increases beyond those envisaged in the
budget. Staff encouraged the authorities to signal commitment to fiscal consolidation in the context
of the Medium-Term Budget Framework (MTBF) for 2015–17 by setting the overall budget deficit for

Although the expected signature of the DCFTA with the EU is likely to result in increased donor funding over the
medium term, Moldova’s difficulties to qualify for financial assistance from the US Millennium Challenge
Corporation’s next funding cycle underscores the economy’s vulnerability to external donor support.

2015 at 2¼ percent of GDP (compared to 2.6 percent in the 2014 budget) and a gradual reduction
of ¼ percent of GDP per year thereafter. Staff suggested the following measures to achieve the
2015 objective: (i) limiting wage increases, which have sharply exceeded those in the private sector,
to projected average inflation (0.3 percent of GDP); (ii) freezing expenditures in goods and services,
excluding healthcare (0.4 percent of GDP); (iii) increasing the excise tax on tobacco products in line
with the objective of narrowing the gap with regional levels and the EU average (0.2 percent of
GDP); and (iv) updating the real estate valuations for tax purposes (0.1 percent of GDP). Staff
encouraged the authorities to prioritize public investment and improve revenue mobilization
through fighting tax avoidance and evasion, including by addressing existing tax expenditures (in
the CIT, PIT, property/land tax, and VAT) and resisting pressures to grant additional ad hoc tax
benefits that erode the tax base. Staff warned against delaying utility tariffs adjustment, given that in
a number of utility companies the level of tariff is already below the cost recovery. It is estimated
that the needed adjustment in heating and utility tariffs is about 10 percent. Staff also noted that
generalized price subsidies are regressive and costly to the budget; instead the government should
consider strengthening targeted social support.
17.
Advancing structural reforms would help strengthen fiscal institutions and safeguard
fiscal sustainability. The authorities have taken steps to strengthen the fiscal policy framework by
adopting or drafting legislation on local public finances, public debt and state guarantees, and fiscal
responsibility. However, staff argued that further reforms are needed to safeguard long-term fiscal
sustainability, improve public financial management, increase resilience to political cycles, and set
the stage for further development of domestic capital markets (Annex IV). In particular:

12

x

Social secuirty reform. Reform of the social security system is needed to put its finances on a
sustainable path, deal with demographic pressures, and reverse the decline in the
replacement rate. Staff recommended adjusting past earning to halt the drop of the
replacement rate, increasing retirement age, increasing contributions from self-employed
and farmers, and refraining from ad-hoc pension increases.

x

Fiscal decentralization. The fiscal decentralization model needs to be reformed to improve
efficiency and safeguard medium-term fiscal sustainability. Staff recommended introducing
binding debt limits on sub-national governments and consolidating the number of local
governments.

x

Fiscal responsibility legislation. The draft Fiscal Responsibility Law (FRL) need be revised to
ensure that it provides an adequate fiscal anchor. Staff noted that expenditure initiatives
approved last year and ad hoc tax benefits recently granted underscore the importance of
adopting a fiscal policy anchor to prevent fiscal policy from being driven by financing
availability and eroding much-needed fiscal buffers against exogenous shocks. Staff
recommended a fiscal policy rule setting the general government budget deficit excluding
grants of 2½ percent of GDP, combined with a rule limiting growth of total expenditures
(excluding targeted social assistance). Given the large infrastructure needs, staff suggested
that the fiscal objectives could in principle be relaxed to accommodate specific

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF MOLDOVA

productivity-enhancing investment projects if financing on reasonable terms is secured, and
the additional investment is consistent with the economy’s absorption capacity.

Authorities’ views
18.
The authorities agreed with the importance of fiscal sustainability but noted that
addressing social and infrastructure needs is a priority if enough financing is available. The
authorities argued that fiscal policy should be guided by financing availability given that most of the
financing is in the form of loans for projects that are supported and monitored by donors. They
believed these projects are essential to making progress in poverty reduction, filling infrastructure
gaps, and institution building. The authorities expect the intended additional wage and pension
increases to be covered with fees from auctioning telecom licenses in 2014 and by additional
privatization proceeds in the following years. Regarding the medium term, the authorities
considered staff’s projections for permanent donor support to be on the low side and explained
their expectation for a substantial increase following the signing of the DCFTA. As for utility tariff
increases, the authorities noted that given the large adjustments in tariffs in recent years payment
discipline is suffering and further increases at this moment would actually lead to an increase in
losses of public enterprises. They also noted that for 2014 they negotiated lower electricity and gas
prices with their foreign suppliers.
19.
The authorities shared staff’s views on the role of structural reforms in ensuring
medium term fiscal sustainability. They noted that achieving the development goals in the NDS
Moldova 2020 will put pressure on capital spending in the coming years and donor financing will be
insufficient. The authorities saw domestic revenue mobilization and development of a domestic debt
market as a key element in their plan to ensure an adequate level of funding for the development
initiatives. Their plans include tax policy and administration reforms aimed at broadening the tax
base, fighting tax avoidance and evasion, and increasing the fairness of the tax system. They also
argued that targeted tax benefits are essential to attracting FDI and generating employment, and
noted that there is significant competition in the region in granting such benefits. The authorities
concurred that reforming the social security and healthcare systems and the decentralization model
are important to improve the quality of services provided to the population and support
medium-term fiscal sustainability. However, they noted that these reforms need to be carefully
planned to ensure that these objectives are met. They intend to continue working closely with their
development partners on these reforms. Similarly, the authorities agreed that the draft laws on local
public finance and on fiscal responsibility can be strengthened.

C. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
Staff’s views
20.
The NBM has maintained an accommodative monetary policy stance reflecting its
concern about inflation breaching the lower bound of the target range. In April 2013, the NBM

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

REPUBLIC OF MOLDOVA

cut the base (policy) rate by 100 basis points to 3.5 percent.4 Due to the muted response of lending
rates and bank credit, further monetary policy easing was carried out in the summer by stepping up
unsterilized foreign exchange purchases to boost liquidity, absorb seasonal foreign currency inflows,
and increase international reserves. In 2013, the NBM purchased US$300 million. In early 2014, in
response to downward pressures on the leu, the NBM sold about US$80 million. The growth of bank
credit to the economy increased to about 19 percent at December–2013.
21.
Going forward, the mission recommended the NBM to remain vigilant and be ready to
adjust policies, including by adopting a tightening bias to counter emerging inflation risks.
The mission noted that while disinflationary pressures have subsided, with headline and core
inflation on the rise and over the mid-point of the target range (5 percent), second-round effects of
the recent nominal exchange rate depreciation and looser fiscal policy are expected to further
contribute to rising inflation. Moreover, headline inflation has been artificially contained (by about
½–1 percentage point) due to unchanged utility tariffs. On the other hand, the projected slowdown
in activity and the lack of evidence of a substantial acceleration in credit growth justify to
wait-and-see before starting the tightening cycle.
22.
Staff recommended maintaining a cautious approach toward interventions to ensure
continued exchange rate adjustments in line with fundamentals. Recent interventions to ease
pressures on the leu were appropriate since they were aimed at preventing disorderly exchange rate
adjustments. The mission noted that although the level of international reserves is broadly adequate
by most metrics, further opportunistic reserve accumulation will improve Moldova’s resilience to
external shocks. In particular, the mission suggested that sustaining about 100 percent coverage of
short-term debt would be critical for external stability (in line with the reserve adequacy in
2008 before the global financial crisis), given the geographical concentration of exports, few export
items and significant dependency on personal transfers (remittances and compensation of
employees), and increased vulnerabilities in the financial sector.
23.
Over the medium term, the success of the inflation targeting regime hinges on
strengthening the monetary transmission mechanism. This will require fostering the
development of the interbank money market (once the current weaknesses in the banking system
are addressed) to make the interbank interest rates more responsive to changes in the NBM base
rate. The mission recommended developing a plan to address the large liquidity surplus in the
banking system, which would improve signaling of monetary policy instruments. 5 Strengthening
coordination between the treasury cash flows and NBM’s operations would also be important, as
well as developing a benchmark yield curve for government debt.
4

The NBM had previously cut the base rate by 550 bp between November 2011 and February 2012.

5

The main reasons for the liquidity surplus are: (i) a very thin interbank money market which forces banks to hold
additional liquidity; (ii) institutional factors (including difficulties in valuation and realization of collateral) that
increase the risk of bank lending and limit banks’ willingness to expand loan portfolios; and (iii) the need to repair
banks’ balance sheets after the surge in NPLs in 2009.

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF MOLDOVA

Authorities’ views
24.
The authorities agreed with staff’s assessment but felt that there was no need to adopt
a tightening bias in the short term. According to the NBM, the significant slowdown in economic
growth they project would result in significant deflationary pressures. At the same time, the NBM
acknowledged that these pressures would be offset to some extent by increased consumption due
to the planned wage and pension increases later in 2014, and the likely adjustment in utility prices
early next year. Overall, the authorities agreed with staff’s proposed approach of wait-and-see but
be ready to tighten if inflationary pressures emerge. The authorities also agreed with staff’s
recommendations about interventions on the foreign exchange market and strengthening inflation
targeting regime.

D. Structural Reforms
Staff’s views
25.
Steady implementation of structural reforms is critical to boost potential growth and
reduce poverty. The strong pace of growth observed since the mid–2000s was driven by domestic
consumption fueled by remittances. The authorities’ medium-term growth model, as presented in
the NDS Moldova 2020, aims at an appropriate shift towards one based on raising investment and
increasing productivity and competitiveness. This would also help Moldova reduce its dependence
on remittances. Staff recommended giving special attention to the following areas: (i) business
environment; (ii) physical infrastructure development; (iii) human resource development; and
(iv) public administration reform (Annex V). Refocusing the education system to labor market needs
would play an important role in raising productivity, job creation and reversing migration trends.
26.
Structural reforms to increase financial intermediation over the longer term would
also be important. The fundamental features of the banking sector in Moldova are weak financial
intermediation (loans represent only 43 percent of GDP) and weak risk management practices. The
lack of access to finance has been identified by the OECD as the top business constraint for firms in
Moldova.6 The entry of new strategic investors (that are subject to appropriate and effective scrutiny
by the relevant authorities) in the market would boost competition and optimize financing costs.
Staff recommended complementing steps to improve collateral execution (e.g., lifting limitations on
the sale of repossessed collateral) and adding new sources of information to the existing credit
bureau. Staff also noted the important role that the development of non-bank financial institutions
can play to help achieve more competition for household savings and business financing.

Authorities’ views
27.
The authorities shared staff’s views and affirmed their commitment to implement the
structural reforms described in the NDS Moldova 2020. The authorities agreed that special
6

OECD, Competitiveness and Private Sector Development, Republic of Moldova, 2011.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

REPUBLIC OF MOLDOVA

attention needs to be paid to improving the business environment, physical infrastructure, and
human resource development. The authorities recognized that the DCFTA poses challenges to
Moldovan economy in the short term, because Moldovan businesses will need to adopt EU
standards and regulations and will face increased competition. In this regard, the Ministry of
Economy, with technical assistance from the EU, has prepared a Roadmap for Enhancing
Competitiveness of Moldova aimed at addressing issues related to labor skills, physical
infrastructure, access to finance, innovation and technology, and quality standards. The Ministry of
Education is working on a comprehensive reform and has prepared a Sector Development Strategy
for 2014-20, which aims at increasing public spending efficiency in the education sector and aligning
curricula of vocational schools with labor market needs.
28.
The authorities also shared staff’s views on importance of structural reforms to
increase financial intermediation over the longer term. The NBM is working on a draft law on
consumer lending, which would establish a unified benchmark lending rate. Although this law aims
mainly at consumer protection, a transparent benchmark rate should help improve transmission of
the monetary policy and stimulate financial intermediation.

POST-PROGRAM MONITORING
29.
Moldova’s capacity to repay the Fund remains strong overall. External debt is projected
to stay on a downward trajectory. A metric-based approach and other traditional measures point to
the adequacy of reserves. The Fund’s exposure peaked at 9.4 percent of GDP in 2012 and is
projected to continue declining over the medium term. Total debt service to the Fund would reach
1.3 percent of total exports (around ½ percent of GDP) in 2015 and peak at 2.3 percent of exports in
2017 (1.1 percent of GDP). Moldova’s relatively high external debt to GDP ratio, emanating largely
from high private external debt relative to GDP, poses some risk. Moldova remains vulnerable to a
number of shocks, including an escalation of geopolitical tensions in the region that could lead to a
disruption of trade routes and gas supplied. The materialization of shocks (identified in RAM) could
adversely affect the economy, culminating in reduced creditworthiness and ability to repay the Fund.

STAFF APPRAISAL
30.
Economic activity is projected to slow down significantly after a strong recovery last
year. The economy expanded by 8.9 percent in 2013, led by a strong rebound in agriculture and
related industries. In 2014, output growth is expected to decelerate to 2¼ percent, reflecting a
moderation in agriculture production and weaker economic activity in main trading partners.
31.
Domestic and external risks are to the downside. Key risks to the near-term outlook
relate to serious vulnerabilities and governance issues in the banking sector, fiscal policy slippages
in the run up to elections, a further slowdown in activity in main trading partners, and intensification
of geopolitical tensions. Strong buffers, in the form of high international reserves and low public
debt, combined with prudent policies would help mitigate the impact of these risks.

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF MOLDOVA

32.
Significant weaknesses in the legal and regulatory frameworks must be urgently
addressed to ensure stability and soundness of the financial sector. Expeditious passage of
legislation is needed to empower the NBM and NCFM to take effective regulatory and supervisory
actions, by having in place adequate procedures for court suspension of regulatory and supervisory
decisions (taking into account the CC ruling) and without staff fearing criminal prosecution or civil
liability for carrying out their duties. In turn, the NBM and NCFM must resolutely and effectively
implement the legal norms pertaining to identification and adequate fit-and-proper requirements
of ultimate beneficial owners and controllers in banks, which should also help enhance the
monitoring of related-party transactions and overall risk management framework of banks. The
enforcement of the anti-money laundering framework also needs to be strengthened.
33.
Prompt action is required by regulators to improve banking sector fundamentals. In
particular, resolute enforcement of capitalization and liquidity requirements is important to reduce
vulnerabilities. Following the recapitalization of Banca de Economii (BEM) by minority shareholders,
the NBM needs to maintain a very high level of scrutiny of its operations until the bank effectively
resolves its high share of nonperforming assets, reduces interbank exposures, and it is verified that
it is in compliance will all regulatory norms. Despite the dilution of the government’s share, the
Ministry of Finance needs to ensure strong representation at the BEM’s board in order to safeguard
public interest. Moreover, the NBM should abstain from regulatory forbearance and the
government from providing commercial banks privileged access to additional public sector deposits.
Banks that fail to meet regulatory requirements must be required by the NBM to develop and
implement a time-bound plan to address the shortcomings.
34.
Fiscal policy should be geared towards a gradual reduction of the budget deficit to a
level compatible with the official assistance available over the medium term. The projected
increase in the budget deficit excluding grants in 2014 (5½ percent of GDP) represents a step in the
opposite direction. While the deficit could be allowed to widen in the near term to accommodate
revenue shortfalls stemming from weaker economic activity, the expenditure envelope envisaged in
the 2014 budget should be maintained. In particular, pressures to grant ad hoc tax benefits and to
increase salaries and pensions should be resisted even if one-off revenues materialize. Going
forward, fiscal policy should aim at narrowing the deficit to 1½ percent of GDP (about 2½ percent
excluding grants) by 2018. This level of deficit would put public debt as a share of GDP on a
downward trend and be consistent with projected financing availability.
35.
Over the medium term, fiscal consolidation needs to be supported by structural fiscal
reforms. Administrative reform is paramount to enhance efficiency of the public sector and
improve the quality of services delivered to the population. The fiscal decentralization model should
be strengthened by tightening sub-national governments’ debt limits and consolidating the
number of local governments. Social security reform is also essential to put the pension fund on a
sound financial basis, deal with demographic pressures, and reverse the decline in pension benefits
relative to wages. Utility tariffs need to be adjusted to cost-recovery levels to avoid further
accumulation of arrears with energy suppliers and ensure an adequate level of investment in the

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

REPUBLIC OF MOLDOVA

sector. The draft law on fiscal responsibility is a welcome step but needs to be strengthened in
order to provide an adequate fiscal anchor.
36.
Monetary policy has been successful in maintaining inflation within the target range.
In the context of disinflationary pressures, the NBM’s current monetary policy stance has remained
appropriate, and the build-up of international reserves in 2013 is welcome as it strengthened
Moldova’s resilience to external shocks. Going forward, the NBM needs to remain ready to adjust
policies, including adopting a tightening bias to counter emerging inflation risks.
37.
Steady implementation of structural reforms is critical to boost potential growth and
reduce poverty. The National Development Strategy—Moldova 2020 aims at an appropriate shift
to a medium-term growth model based on raising investment and increasing productivity and
competitiveness. In order to achieve these goals, special attention needs to be paid to improving
the business environment, physical infrastructure, and human resources development. Refocusing
the education system to labor market needs would play an important role in raising productivity,
job creation and reversing migration trends.
38.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Moldova be held on the standard
12-month cycle.

1/ In 2013, a change in the scope of government reduces both revenue and expenditure by about 0.5 percent of GDP.
2/ In 2009, an EU project grant of €15 million was reclassified as budget support given that no actual expenditure took place.
3/ Includes direct budget support from the IMF of SDR 80 million in 2010 and SDR 15 million in 2011.
4/ Includes mainly central bank liabilities to the IMF.

Annex I. External Stability Assessment
1.

Indicators relating to the external sector have substantially improved during the past

three years, reflecting improved external environment and prudent macroeconomic policies.
Some degree of improvement in economic performance in trading partners, fiscal consolidation,
exchange rate flexibility, on-going trade liberalization with positive impact on exports, have
contributed to improvement in external sector performance. With improved current account
position and appreciable capital flows, the NBM has been able to build up reserves, and measures
of competitiveness and quality of business environment show some improvement. Important
vulnerabilities remain, however, and point to the importance of maintaining macroeconomic
stability and putting in place structural measures that would help raise potential economic growth.
2.

There is no evidence of significant exchange rate misalignment. Although results from

three CGER-type methodologies suggest that the leu could be slightly overvalued, competitiveness
appears broadly adequate. The macroeconomic balance approach points to a slight overvaluation
in the range of 2.3 to 4.6 percent, as the underlying current account (7.7 percent of GDP) exceeds
the norm (6.4 percent of GDP)1 by a small margin. The external stability approach also points to a
moderate overvaluation in the range of 5.0 to 9.7 percent. Consistent with the other two
approaches, the equilibrium real exchange approach points to a moderate overvaluation of
6.9 percent. This mild overvaluation does not appear to affect external competitiveness, as strong
export performance has been sustained.2

Comprehensive reforms implemented during the past three years have contributed to

some improvement in competitiveness and the business environment.3 Moldova’s ranking in
doing business report improved from 81 out of 189 countries in 2012 to 78 in 2013 and its ranking
with respect to global competitiveness index was broadly stable during the same period. Despite
moderate improvement, significant challenges remain. According to World Economic Forum,
corruption, policy instability and access to finance constitute the most important impediments to
doing business in Moldova. Structural reforms that focus on these areas, in the context of
implementation of the Association agreement with the EU, would help with enhancing the
competitiveness of the economy, with positive impact on economic diversification and employment
generation.

Annex II. Spillover Assessment
Moldova continues to face high geographic concentration of its exports and private transfers constitute
a significant source of financing for trade deficit. Because of its trade, remittances and financial
linkages, Moldova’s business cycle is synchronized with its trading partners. While improved fiscal and
external positions have helped to put the Moldovan economy in a better position to conduct some
countercyclical policies, it is critical to continue with prudent macroeconomic management that would
aid with further enhancing fiscal and external buffers.

Stylized Facts on the Balance of Payments
1.

Over the last two decades, the Moldovan economy was hit by several external shocks

emanating from trading partners and global developments, including the Russian Crisis in 1998,
food and fuel shocks in 2007–08, and the global financial crisis and the accompanying recession in
2008–09). The potential channels through which external shocks could impact on the Moldovan
economy include trade, remittances, net capital inflows (including FDI). In addition, macroeconomic
conditions in donor countries tend to play a key role in official aid flows.
2.

There has been significant geographical concentration of exports and imports, with

moderate improvement in diversification. Close to 40 percent of exports were destined to CIS
countries during 2003–08, with Russia receiving 45 percent of this amount, Ukraine (28 percent), and
Belarus (16 percent). During the same period, about 51 percent of total exports were shipped to the
EU, with Romania, Italy, and Germany being the main trading partners. This is the result of
continuous liberalization of trade between Moldova and the EU, including the granting of unilateral
trade preferences to Moldova and the autonomous trade preference. The implementation of the
Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade and Association Agreements with the EU is expected to
produce enhanced export performance, and more product and geographical diversification in the
medium to long term. The same main trading partners for exports, plus Turkey and China, are the
main sources of imports to Moldova (Figure AII.1). Food dominates exports, while industrial
products constitute the major share of imports.
3.

Large-scale labor emigration and the associated workers’ transfers have contributed to

shaping Moldova’s economic landscape. The rising trend in remittances and compensation of
employees started on the back of the 1998 regional crisis, which encouraged a process of
large-scale emigration. In 2003–08, remittances averaged about 29 percent of GDP and fell
considerably during 2009–10, contributing to marked reduction in domestic demand and real GDP
growth. As economic conditions in the source for countries for remittances improved, remittances

34

REPUBLIC OF MOLDOVA

also increased and there was a sustained increase in output. Russia constitutes a significant source
of remittances to Moldova and such a significant concentration comes with high exposure to
developments in Russia (Figure AII.1).

Structural Vector Autoregression
4.

The spillovers of external growth shocks on Moldova’s economy and their

transmission are quantified using impulse responses from a structural VAR (SVAR) model. The
VAR includes four domestic macroeconomic variables (real GDP, real effective exchange rate (REER),
export volume, and private personal transfers (remittances and compensation of employees-to-GDP
ratio) and an external activity variable, proxied either by an export-weighted average of Moldova’s
main trading partners’ real GDP or by Russia’s real GDP.1 Structural shocks to the external activity
variable are identified by a Cholesky decomposition, assuming that the external activity variable is
contemporaneously exogenous to Moldova’s economy. Furthermore, due to the small size of
Moldova’s economy, Moldova’s variables are assumed to have no impact on external activity, not
only contemporaneously but also with lags.
5.

Impulse response analysis suggests that external activity shocks have a sizable and

lasting impact on Moldova’s GDP. A negative one-standard deviation shock to the level of
Moldova’s main trading partners’ GDP (corresponding to a decrease of 0.8 percent) decreases
Moldova’s real GDP by about the same amount, namely by 0.7 percent on impact and by about
1.8 percent after three quarters. As shown in Figure AII.2, the impact is not only sizeable, but also
long-lasting. The output collapse that Moldova experienced during the recent global financial crisis
is evidence for this empirical result. As expected, after a negative activity shock abroad, Moldova’s
REER appreciates initially by about 1.5 percent. While exports’ response on impact is not statistically
significant, they decrease by about 4 percent a year after the shock. Remittances decline
immediately, lowering remittances-to-GDP ratio by about 0.7 percentage points (pp) and reaching
the maximum decline of 2.5 pp by three quarters after the shock.

6.

Given Russia’s dominant role as Moldova’s main trading partner and recent regional

developments, the above SVAR framework is employed to analyze spillovers from a shock to
Russia’s GDP. Figure AII.3 highlights that a negative one-standard deviation shock to Russia’s real
GDP (corresponding to -1.1 percent) would lead to a decrease of Moldova’s GDP by half of the initial
shock size, namely by 0.6 percent on impact. Moldova’s GDP response reaches its dip of 1.5 percent
two quarters after the shock. Impulse response analysis suggests that a negative shock to Russia’s
1

All variables except for remittances-to-GDP ratio are expressed in logarithms. The model is estimated using
quarterly data (seasonally adjusted) for the period 2000Q1-2013Q2 with four lags. The data sources are IMF’s Word
Economic Outlook and Global Economic Environment Databases, Moldova’s National Bureau of Statistics and
National Bank. Variables were selected to determine the role of real sector linkages (exports and remittances) in
transmitting exogenous activity shocks to domestic real activity (real GDP) and competitiveness (REER). While most
conventional tests (Akaike Info and Schwarz Criteria) suggested including eight lags, four lags were chosen as a
natural choice for quarterly data and also given the sample size.

36

GDP transmits to Moldovan economy faster and through the remittances rather than export
channel. Remittances-to-GDP ratio decreases by about 2 pp already one quarter after the shock.
Moldova’s total exports are not found to be statistically significant, possibly due to the small size of
Moldova’s share in total Russia imports.

Application of the VELIC2
7.

Moldova’s vulnerability to growth crisis has improved compared to the period before

the global financial crisis and associated great recession. The GDVI points to increasing risks of a
sudden growth declines in the periods before the advent of the crisis, reflecting weak
macroeconomic fundamentals (Figure AII.4). The index, however, appears to suggest an improved
economic situation and improved ability to avoid growth collapse, emanating from enhanced fiscal
and external sectors performance in recent years. The improvement in fiscal position combined with
enhanced external buffers has helped to reduce inherent vulnerabilities to a sudden decline in
growth, emanating from external shocks.
8.

A reduction in global growth by about ½ percentage point in 2014 would reduce

Moldova’s growth by close to 0.3 percent3. The main transmission mechanisms are trade of
goods and services (arising from reduced external demand and remittances) and lower FDI. The
initial deterioration in the current account position, however, is mitigated by lower imports due to
reduced growth and lesser energy costs. The lower output growth, on the other hand, results in
higher fiscal deficit and debt, culminating in reduced fiscal space.4 Incorporating fiscal adjustments
yield less deterioration in fiscal indicators compared to no-adjustment scenario.

Conclusions and Policy Recommendation
9.

The Moldovan economy faces the challenges of few export products destined to small

number of countries and further efforts are required to ensure economic transformation and
diversification. Trade deficit persists and it is being financed largely by private transfers, which
shows the dependency of Moldova on the external environment. A key lesson that emerges from
the analysis is the criticality of continuing with prudent macroeconomic policy that would aid in
further strengthening fiscal and external buffers, thereby enhancing the resilience of the economy to
external shocks, to which Moldova is highly exposed. A more regionally diversified trade structure

The VELIC is a quantitative tool for identifying emerging risks and vulnerabilities in low-income countries (LICs). The
recent round of the exercise, including summary results and methodologies are in Low-Income Countries Global
Risks and Vulnerabilities Report (SM/13/257). For a comprehensive discussion on GDVI, see Dabla-Norris, E., and Y.

Development, Vol.59, pp.360-378.

The scenario is based on four main drivers, a slightly weaker recovery in the US, a much more subdued recovery in
the euro area, emerging market economies not recovering back to their pre-crisis growth paths, and a slightly less
successful implementation of Japan’s three-pronged recovery strategy.

Fiscal space is calculated as the difference between the observed primary balance and the primary balance that, if
maintained at the same level every year, would enable the country to achieve a specified public debt target by 2030.

Annex III. Key Findings and Recommendations of the FSAP
The recent FSAP update mission found that risks to systemic financial stability are significant.1 Despite
some progress in addressing the recommendations of the 2008 FSAP update and the satisfactory
reported performance of banks, there are serious governance problems in several banks, including the
largest ones, the ability of the regulators to take action is constrained, and the crisis management
framework is weak.

Key Findings
Moldova has taken several initiatives to address recommendations of the FSAP update of

x

2008. New regulations and instructions were issued in key supervisory areas, for example on
asset classification of banks or bank capital adequacy. The NBM’s quantitative analysis of
banks was improved. A National Committee for Financial Stability (NCFS) was set up in
2010 to bring together key stakeholders in financial system stability.
However, many important weaknesses remain. Considerable caution is needed in regard to

x

the relatively benign performance indicators of banks. Ultimate beneficial ownership of
several large banks has been actively concealed, which may disguise credit to related parties
and large exposures. The latter already exceed regulatory norms by a wide margin in some
banks. The liquidity position of some banks may also be worse than reported since some
assets may be encumbered through undisclosed side agreements. In general, governance
structures and internal oversight processes are not well developed, blurring the roles and
responsibilities of owners and managers, and so put at risk safe banking operations.
The FSAP stress test results showed that credit risk losses on the loan book represent the

x

most important factor for the banking system. Potential credit risk losses were estimated to
reach MDL 5 billion (or 7½ percent of GDP) under the most-stressed scenario. Market risk
losses were not found significant since most bank loans are issued at floating interest rates,
net open foreign exchange positions of banks are very small, and trading instruments are
negligible in banks’ investment portfolios.
The regulatory framework for banks and non-bank financial institutions has a number of

x

shortcomings. The ability of the National Bank of Moldova (NBM) and the National
1

40

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF MOLDOVA

Commission for Financial Markets (NCFM) to enforce regulations has been seriously
hampered by a series of court challenges. There is inadequate legal protection for
supervisory staff. Even allowing for the legal constraints, the NBM has on some occasions
failed to take corrective actions when faced with serious or persistent infringements by the
banks.
x

The crisis management framework is weak. The NCFS lacks focus and is not forward looking.
There is little evidence of contingency planning and testing of processes and powers.
Coordination between the member agencies is limited. There are also significant gaps and
deficiencies in the statutory powers required for cost-effective bank crisis resolution. Several
aspects of the deposit insurance scheme require strengthening, for example, a back-up
funding facility for the Deposit Guarantee Fund should be put in place.

Key Recommendations
x

Financial Stability Framework. Amend the Law on NBM and Law on NCFM, and other
legislation as required, to provide NBM and NCFM with the ability to enforce supervisory
and regulatory actions in a timely manner (addressing, for instance, problems ensuing from
the Constitutional Court rulings of October 2013).

x

Bank Governance. Re-evaluate bank shareholders to ensure disclosure of ultimate beneficial
owners.

x

Banking Supervision. Amend the Law on NBM to provide full legal protection to all NBM
employees in case of lawsuits for action in good faith.

x

Crisis Resolution. Develop a comprehensive financial crisis resolution contingency plan, and
identify necessary amendments to the legislation.

x

Deposit Insurance System. Enhance funding of the deposit Guarantee Fund (DGF) by
developing a target fund methodology; amending legislation to provide a line-of-credit to
the DGF from the Ministry of Finance; and amending the Law on DGF Law and Law on NBM
to include the NBM as an additional source of back-up funding for the DGF.

x

Financial Market Infrastructure. Develop a comprehensive risk management framework for
the National Securities Depository.

Annex IV. Addressing Medium-Term Fiscal Challenges
Moldova is facing significant risks associated with excessive fiscal decentralization and bourgeoning
healthcare and pension spending. The authorities need to develop a new design of intergovernmental
relations that would empower subnational governments without endangering fiscal discipline at the
national level, and to adopt parametric reforms to secure long-term sustainability of the healthcare
and pension systems. In this context, the draft FRL and planned improvements to the local public
finance law are welcome steps, seeking to anchor policy decisions to a sustainable path.
1.

While providing autonomy to subnational governments, fiscal decentralization must

also create incentives for administrative rationalization. Fiscal decentralization can lead to
efficiency gains and is not necessarily detrimental to performance at the national level, as long as its
design is not based primarily on transfers from the central government. If subnational governments
have responsibility for financing their expenditures through own revenues, decentralization can
improve the quality and delivery of public services. With 32 regions (rayons) and over one thousand
municipalities, the existing model in Moldova, however, has become highly inefficient, with a large
number of subnational governments spending most of their resources on personnel and being
dependent on transfers from the central government to deliver services. Accordingly, the authorities
need to develop a new design of intergovernmental fiscal relations that would explicitly incorporate
the principles of accountability and transparency and empower subnational governments without
endangering fiscal discipline at the national level.
2.

Moldova’s pay-as-you-go pension system is already on a financially unsustainable

path and will face even greater demographic pressures over the longer term. Following a
20 percent increase in pension benefits in 2009 and a supplementary pension payment granted in
2013, the social security deficit increased from 1.4 percent of GDP in 2008 to 3 percent in 2013. With
the planned doubling of supplemental pension payment to about 600,000 pensioners, the pension
deficit is projected to widen to 3.6 percent of GDP in 2014 and 3.8 percent in 2015, raising concerns
about its sustainability over the medium term. The main problem is the dependency ratio—the
number of contributing workers to pensioners—that stands at 1.3, compared to a financially
sustainable rate of at least 4. Labor migration has led to a substantial decline in the workforce, and
the dependency ratio is projected to further decline. Although the replacement rate—the ratio of
average pension to average wage—is very low (28 percent, compared to an average of 43 percent in
CEE/CIS countries), as a result of the aging population and high migration, pensioners already
account for 20 percent of the country’s population. In addition, the retirement age—62 years for

42

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF MOLDOVA

men and 57 years for women—is relatively low, compared to other countries. Although the
contribution rate is at a level comparable to other countries, reported contribution-liable earnings
are low and various groups, such as self-employed and farmers, are allowed to make flat social
security contributions established at a level that translates into a contribution base significantly
below the average wage.

3.

A comprehensive reform agenda is necessary to offer socially-acceptable benefits,

while ensuring long-term sustainability. In order to increase pension benefits to a sociallyacceptable level and to secure long-term sustainability of the pension system, a number of
parametric reforms are needed: (i) no further ad-hoc increases in pension benefits; (ii) raising male
and female retirement ages to 65, with indexation to advancements in life expectancy, to make any
increase in benefits affordable; (iii) linking pension contributions by self-employed and farmers to
the level of income declared for tax purposes, rather than an arbitrary minimum; and (iv) improving
the compliance rates in terms of contribution to the pension system.
4.

Developing a rules-based fiscal framework would anchor policy decisions to a

sustainable path. The draft FRL contains important elements to strengthen the medium-term fiscal
framework, including a fiscal policy rule defined as a general government budget deficit target of
3 percent of GDP excluding foreign-financed projects. Although the adoption of a binding fiscal
rule—with escape clauses that require the correction of any deviation from the rule within three
years—is encouraging, the proposed rule is too loose and not compatible with a level of the budget
deficit that is sustainable over the medium term. For example, under the proposed rule, the overall
budget deficit including foreign-financed projects would have been 5.8 percent of GDP in 2013.
Furthermore, without sound counter-cyclical properties, it would make fiscal policy more procyclical
and lead to excessive volatility in government spending.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

43

REPUBLIC OF MOLDOVA

5.

A fiscal rule should link fiscal policy to the objective of sustainability and behave in a

countercyclical manner under normal macroeconomic conditions. The draft FRL could be
strengthened to provide better guidance for fiscal policy and medium-term planning. First, the
proposed fiscal rule does not have an explicit link to public debt sustainability. Second, an overall
budget balance rule alone would not constitute an appropriate fiscal policy stance over the
economic cycle, and therefore would not help reduce spending volatility in the absence of an
appropriate constraint on expenditures. Third, while an overall budget deficit target excluding
foreign-financed projects helps isolate the fiscal aggregates on which the government has more
policy control, the exclusion of such capital expenditure from the rule’s coverage may distort
budgetary classification and might not be consistent with the objective of aggregate demand
management.
6.

The proposed fiscal rule can be fine-tuned to have countercyclical properties with a

more explicit reference to public debt sustainability. Although a structural fiscal balance target
would provide an operational guideline for policymakers to formulate and maintain a countercyclical
stance, its calculation is a challenging exercise. Accordingly, in view of capacity constraints in
implementation, staff recommends a fiscal policy rule defined as a general government budget
deficit of 2½ percent of GDP excluding grants together with an expenditure rule that limits the
annual growth rate of total expenditures excluding targeted social assistance to potential GDP
growth (which could be estimated using an econometric model or simply defined as, for example, a
10-year average). In view of the country’s large infrastructure needs, the medium-term fiscal
objective could in principle be relaxed to accommodate productivity-enhancing investment projects
if financing on reasonable terms is secured, and the additional investment is consistent with the
economy’s absorption capacity.
7.

A fiscal policy rule needs to have sufficient flexibility to respond to shocks, while being

supported by explicit enforcement procedures and corrective mechanisms. The FRL should
provide clarity in escape clauses, particularly in terms of the range and size of shocks, with an
unambiguous guideline on the interpretation and determination of events such as natural disasters,
to prevent unwarranted deviations from the fiscal rule. In addition to escape clauses, the FRL could
have specifics on adjustment mechanisms and modalities of their enforcements when ceilings/floors
are missed. Finally, the authorities should consider appointing an independent fiscal council with a
mandate to evaluate ex post compliance with the fiscal rule and to assess macroeconomic forecasts
and proposed fiscal policies, which would foster greater transparency and buttress credibility of the
fiscal rule.

Annex V. National Development Strategy—Moldova 2020
The National Development Strategy (NDS)—known as “Moldova 2020”—was approved by the
Parliament of the Republic of Moldova on July 11, 2012 and officially published on November 30,
2012. While the NDS provides a good basis for inclusive growth, its implementation will be key.
1.

The NDS unifies in one document the government's poverty reduction strategy and a

vision of long-term sustainable economic development. It appropriately aims at a shift from the
current consumption-based growth model towards one based on raising investment and increasing
productivity and competitiveness.
2.

The NDS presents a selective medium-term strategy that focuses on seven national

development priorities: (1) aligning the education system to labor market needs; (2) increasing
public investment in national and local road infrastructure; (3) reducing financing costs by increasing
competition in the financial sector and developing risk management tools; (4) improving the
business climate, promoting competition policies, streamlining the regulatory framework and
applying information technologies in public services for businesses and citizens; (5) reducing energy
consumption by increasing energy efficiency and using renewable energy sources; (6) ensuring
financial sustainability of the pension system; and (7) increasing quality and efficiency of justice and
fighting corruption.
3.

While the NDS provides a good basis for inclusive growth in Moldova, special

attention should be given to the following areas for its implementation and strengthening.
(i) Business environment. Priority should be given to improving corporate governance in the financial
sector and the broader economy. In this regard, reform of the judiciary is essential to protect
investors and foster investment. (ii) Physical infrastructure development. Priority should be given to
investment in energy, telecommunications, transportation, water, and sanitation infrastructure,
possibly with private sector partnerships. (iii) Human resource development. The NDS should ensure
that the educational system is aligned with European standards and is responsive to labor market
needs. Improving incentives to health care providers to both increase efficiency and deliver quality
health services will be critical in Moldova’s efforts to meet the MDGs. (iv) Public administration
reform. Greater emphasis on civil service management reform is key to the success of other reforms.
(v) Monitoring and evaluation. The successful implementation of the NDS will critically depend on
continued efforts to strengthen the monitoring framework and capacity of key line ministries to
develop and implement annual action plans, and integrate these actions into the medium-term
expenditure framework.

Safeguards Assessments:
An update safeguards assessment of the National Bank of Moldova (NBM) conducted in the context
of the ECF/EFF arrangements approved by the Board on January 29, 2010 was completed on June 3,
2010. The assessment found that the NBM had strengthened its safeguards framework since the
May 2006 assessment by implementing the majority of the related recommendations. However, the
update assessment noted the need for independent oversight of the bank and also recommended
changes to the central bank’s law to strengthen governance and the framework for lending to local

2

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF MOLDOVA

banks. The authorities agreed with the findings of the update assessment, but implementation of
these recommendations to address the remaining weaknesses remains outstanding.
Exchange Arrangements:
Moldova has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3 and 4, of the Fund’s Articles of
Agreement. Its exchange system remains free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current
international transactions.
Moldova’s exchange rate regime is classified as “floating”. The NBM intervenes in the domestic
foreign exchange interbank market in order to smooth out sharp exchange rate fluctuations of the
Moldovan leu against the dollar. At the same time, the NBM interventions are not aimed at
changing the trend of the exchange rate determined by the market. The NBM publishes the
information on its interventions.
The official exchange rate of the Moldovan leu to the U.S. dollar announced by the NBM is
determined as the weighted average of daily noncash market transactions performed on the
interbank and intrabank market. The NBM quotes exchange rates of the leu for other currencies on
the basis of the leu-U.S. dollar rate and the cross-rate between the U.S. dollar and these currencies.
Article IV Consultations:
The previous Article IV consultation was concluded on September 28, 2012. The staff report (Country
Report No. 12/288) was published.
FSAP Participation:
Moldova received an FSAP mission in May 2004; the FSSA (Country Report No. 05/64) was presented
to the Board at the time of the 2004 Article IV discussions. An FSAP update mission visited Moldova
in October 2007; the FSSA update (Country Report No. 08/274) was presented to the Board with
the 2007 Article IV Consultation report. A second FSAP update mission visited Moldova in
March 2014; the FSSA update is being presented to the Board with the 2014 Article IV Consultation
report.
Resident Representative:
Ms. Armine Khachatryan assumed her duties as Resident Representative in August 2013.

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
(As of April 9, 2014)
1.
Moldova's National Development Strategy (NDS)—Moldova 2020 sets seven strategic
priorities. These are justice and fight against corruption; national education system aligned with
labor market requirements; pensions; business environment; roads infrastructure; accessible and
inexpensive finance; and energy efficiency. The NDS is intended to prioritize state interventions to
deliver the overarching goal of bringing about qualitative economic development and poverty
reduction. It was adopted by the Parliament as national law. The NDS and its consolidated action
plan include some measures to reduce inequality and address key crosscutting themes, such as
social inclusion and gender equality, environmental preservation, climate change and disaster events,
and reintegration of localities from the left bank of the Nistru River (Transnistria).
2.
Aligned with the NDS, the World Bank Group (WBG) Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for
FY14–17, discussed by the Board on September 5, 2013, will provide Moldova with US$570 million
over the next four years (US$450 million on IBRD&IDA [International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development & International Development Association, together known as the World Bank] terms,
plus US$120 million IFC [International Finance Corporation] commitments). It will support Moldova
in reducing poverty and boosting shared prosperity by capturing the full benefits of openness and
integration with the European Union and the broader global economy. Three pillars are proposed,
which will help Moldova diversify and expand its endowment of institutional, human, and natural
capital:


Increasing Competitiveness: continued institutional reforms for a business enabling environment
and governance, access to finance, transparency in the financial sector, and targeted activities to
help improve companies' competitiveness are needed to reduce barriers and to translate
economic openness into concrete benefits of more jobs and higher income.



Enhancing Human Capital and Minimizing Social Risks: the widening gap with EU28 in education
and health outcomes needs to be progressively closed. Demographic challenges need to be
addressed, and vulnerabilities can be tackled by strengthening social protection systems.



Promoting a Green, Clean and Resilient Moldova: the debilitating effects of climatic events on
agriculture and rural livelihoods need to be addressed, natural resource management improved,
and energy security and efficiency achieved to ensure sustainable development.

3.
The CPS has governance and gender lenses, and a calibrated engagement in localities from
Transnistria will be considered in close consultation with the authorities of the Republic of Moldova.
4.
This CPS continues to address governance issues at the country, sectorial and operational
levels across the strategy. Interventions will be pursued to improve the business enabling
environment; enhance public administration reform and quality of public service delivery; and
improve public financial management and procurement systems. The CPS will use a governance

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

5

REPUBLIC OF MOLDOVA

filter to ensure that governance is systematically tackled in all operations (analytical and advisory
activities and lending); it will also support enhanced involvement of Civil Society Organizations
through the Global Partnership for Social Accountability to which Moldova has opted in. At the
operational level, WBG will ensure the highest fiduciary standards in projects it supports while
helping the Government to strengthen country systems. This CPS is informed by a gender
assessment, the outcomes of which will be discussed at the concept stage of each relevant new
operation (analytical and advisory activities and lending).
5.
The World Bank’s current portfolio includes seven investment financing projects and one
budget support operation. Total commitments amount to US$189.9 million. The disbursement ratio
for FY14 so far is 27.9 percent (as of May 7, 2014), and was 34.1 percent at the end of FY13. The
ongoing IDA portfolio is broad ranging, with the highest concentration of operations in human
development and agriculture and rural development, as well as in the financial and private sectors.
Trust Funds (TFs) provide co-financing to IDA operations, finance carbon operations, and provide
other forms of support, including for Analytical and Advisory Activities. The size of the active TF
portfolio is US$35.8 million.
6.
Alongside IDA and IBRD resources, IFC operations in Moldova will continue to focus on
investment and advisory activities that enable private sector growth and diversification. IFC plans an
annual funding envelope of about US$30 million. IFC exposure as of June 30, 2013, was
US$90.3 million in 18 clients across the financial, manufacturing, agriculture, telecommunications,
water, and energy sectors.
7.
The net exposure of MIGA in Moldova at the end of 2012 amounted to US$17.8 million in
four projects. All projects are in support of foreign banks' subsidiaries in the country, including
micro-finance organizations and leasing operations. MIGA’s continuing support to these projects
signals MIGA’s efforts to underwrite projects in Moldova, encourage inward foreign direct
investment, and add to the WBG’s strategy of encouraging private sector development in the
country.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of May 12, 2014)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General:
Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance. Over the last several years, with technical
assistance from the Fund the authorities have improved statistics in several areas, including
national accounts, fiscal and monetary data, consumer prices, external trade and balance of
payments. Technical assistance is ongoing in the area of price and national accounts statistics.
National Accounts:
National accounts statistics are prepared by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) based on the
concepts and methods of the 1993 SNA System of National Accounts (SNA). Estimates do not
include the Transnistria region for which data have not been collected since 1991. GDP is
estimated from the production and the expenditure sides, annually and quarterly. The data are
prepared in current and constant (previous year) prices, and annual data are revised—in two
stages—as updated information becomes available. Starting in January 2014, short-term activity
indicators are re-classified according to CAEM Rev. 2. National accounts will be published
according to CAEM Rev.2, starting in Q1 2015. Work is on-going to implement the 2008 SNA and
to further improve the compilation of quarterly and annual national accounts.

Price statistics:
The NBS publishes monthly CPI and PPI data and began publications of the core CPI
from 2010. The weights of the CPI basket are updated on an annual basis to reflect adjustment in
consumer expenditures. On-going technical assistance has improved the reliability of the CPI
weights and continues to work with the NBS to expand CPI coverage to include owner-occupied
housing.
Government finance statistics:
Moldova reports annual government finance statistics (GFS) based on Government Finance
Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001) methodology for publication in the Government Finance
Statistics Yearbook (GFSY). The data are on a cash basis and cover above as well as below the
line operations and financial balance sheet of the general government sector. With the support
of Fund TA, the authorities introduced regular dissemination of monthly GFSM 2001 based data
for the budgetary central government units.

Monetary statistics:
Monetary and financial statistics are broadly in line with recommendations of the Monetary and
Financial Statistics Manual and of a generally good quality. The NBM compiles and submits
monetary data using Standardized Report Forms (SRFs). Monetary data are reported by the NBM
on a regular basis and are being published in the International Financial Statistics. The NBM also
report Financial Soundness Indicators (FSIs) on a quarterly basis, which are posted on the FSI
webpage.

External sector statistics:
The compilation methodology follows the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual. The
transition to the sixth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual is planned for Q3, 2014. Besides
the balance of payments statistics, Moldova disseminates quarterly international investment
position and external debt statistics. Data on international reserves and foreign currency liquidity
are disseminated monthly.

DISCUSSIONS—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

Approved By
Dhaneshwar Ghura (IMF),
Jeffrey D. Lewis and
Roumeen Islam (World
Bank)

Prepared by Staff of the International Monetary Fund and
the World Bank

Moldova’s risk of debt distress remains low based on an assessment of its public external
debt, but with a heightened overall risk of debt distress, reflecting vulnerabilities related to
domestic debt and private external debt.1 This finding is in line with the previous DSA,
which was conducted as part of the 2012 Article IV consultation.2 In view of the country’s
vulnerability to growth shocks and potential contingent liability arising from
recapitalization needs of the banking system, continued fiscal discipline is critical to
ensuring sustainability. There are also risks related to the high external debt to GDP ratio,
emanating largely from unusually high private debt for a low-income country.

1

This full DSA was prepared jointly by IMF and World Bank staff, in consultation with the Moldovan
authorities, using the debt sustainability framework for low-income countries approved by the Boards of both
institutions, and in accordance with the new staff guidance note on the application of the joint Bank-Fund
Debt Sustainability Framework for Low-Income Countries (SM/13/292). The inclusion of the overall risk is in
line with the new staff guidance note on the application of the joint Bank-Fund Debt Sustainability Framework
for Low-Income Countries (SM/13/292). This assessment reflects the high level of external private sector debt.

IMF Country Report for Moldova (No. 12/288).

REPUBLIC OF MOLDOVA

BACKGROUND
1.
Moldova’s total external debt at end–2013 was 84.4 percent of GDP compared to
82.4 percent of GDP at end–2012. 3 Public and public-guaranteed (PPG) external debt decreased
by about 1 percentage point and private external debt increased by 3 percentage points.4 Moldova’s
PPG debt at end–2013 was about 30 percent of GDP compared to 31 percent at end–2011. PPG debt
is mainly external (¾ of total) and held by multilateral and bilateral donors that hold 98 percent of
PPG external debt. Domestic debt (¼ of total) is mostly short term and about 66 percent is held by
the domestic banking system. In contrast, PPG external debt is mostly medium- and long-term, and
the high level of concessionality of official borrowing helps keep the external debt service
manageable.
2.
Private sector debt is high for a low-income country. The stock of external private sector
debt has increased in recent years, reaching US$4.9 billion as at end–2013, mostly due to increased
trade credit and commercial loans. There has been rising external exposure of the banking system,
mainly on a long-term basis, and bank’s share of total private external debt reached about
8.7 percent by end 2013. Medium and long-term’s share of total external private debt was about
55 percent as at end-2013. The majority of non-bank debt is short term, and consists of trade
credits, arrears and other payments liabilities, mostly for the imports of natural resources.5 Private
borrowing in Moldova, similar to other CEE countries are extended mainly to foreign-owned
companies from their parents abroad.

UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS
3.
The macroeconomic outlook has been revised to reflect changes in near- and
medium-term projections compared to the previous DSA assessment. In 2013, the Moldovan
economy expanded at an above-trend pace with real GDP growth reaching 8.9 percent, on the back
of the strong recovery in agricultural production after the previous year’s severe drought. This year,
however, GDP is expected to grow at 2.2 percent, mainly reflecting the anticipated slowdown in
agriculture and weaker external environment. Inflation is projected to remain within the central
3
The current DSA includes intra-company lending as private external debt. Previously, it was classified as foreign
direct investment (FDI) on the presumption that it constituted a form of equity investment. As a result of this
reclassification, the external-debt-to GDP ratio at end-2013 was 84.4 percent of GDP compared to near 71.9 percent
projected in the 2013 Article IV report.
4

PPG debt covers gross debt of the general government, while debts of state-owned enterprises are not included
unless they are explicitly guaranteed by the government. As of September 2013, the government-guaranteed portion
of SOE debt amounted to 0.1 percent of GDP, while the total amount of SOE debt, including external borrowing and
domestic loans from commercial banks, stood at about 2.4 percent of GDP. In line with the DSA guidelines, public
debt includes liabilities to the IMF. Small differences relative to the macro framework reflect primarily that DSA debt
does not include arrears. Similarly, small differences in the primary surplus are because in the DSA it is calculated as
the overall balance net of interest payments while in the macro framework tables it is calculated as the overall
balance net of interest payments and earnings.

bank’s target range as in the previous assessment. The external positions were stronger in 2012 and
2013 compared to the previous assessment, resulting in stronger external buffers. In this regard, the
medium-term current account deficit is projected to be narrower than in the 2012 Article
IV consultation. The fiscal position is not projected to improve as much as envisaged in the previous
DSA. Over the medium–to long–term, the baseline scenario now assumes a lower potential and
actual output growth (Box 1), reflecting departure from policies agreed under the previous
Fund-supported program on fiscal and financial sector policies.

EXTERNAL AND PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
A. External Debt Sustainability Analysis
4.
All external public debt ratios remain well below the thresholds under the baseline and
stress scenarios. In the alternative scenario in which key variables remain at their historical averages
(2013–2033), the present value of debt-to-GDP and remittances ratio would reach 21 percent
compared to 13 percent under the baseline scenario. The present value of debt-to-exports and
remittances as well as to revenue would also increase substantially. This result is an indication of the
significant fiscal and external adjustments that have taken place in recent years. At the same time, it
underscores the importance for Moldova of staying on the path of sound economic policies and
reforms.

REPUBLIC OF MOLDOVA

Box 1. Macroeconomic Assumptions behind the DSA
Real GDP increased by 8.9 percent in 2013 and is projected to grow at 2.2 percent in 2014 driven
by the anticipated slowdown in agriculture. An expected recovery in FDI following the signing of
the DCFTA with the EU as well as advances in structural reforms will help sustain the economy’s
potential growth rate at 4 percent in the medium term.
Inflation is expected to average 5½–6 percent in 2014–15, reflecting robust domestic demand
combined with increased utility tariffs. Headline inflation is expected to be 5 percent over the
medium to long term in line with the NBM’ mid-target.
Exports are expected to be a key source of economic growth. They are projected to further
increase in the medium term in line with the recent trends and supported by structural reforms to
improve the business environment, reduce the costs of doing business and enhance the provision
of infrastructure. As a result, exports of goods and services are projected to reach 49.8 percent of
GDP in 2033 (compared with 44.1 percent in 2013).
Imports are projected to grow as well, underpinned by intermediate imports needed for the
exports, though the decline in the growth of remittances would contribute to moderating the
growth of imports. Imports as a ratio of GDP are projected at 84percent of GDP in 2033.
Remittances grew rapidly in 2012 and 2013 due to construction-related activities in Russia and
the social challenges associated with drought in Moldova in 2012. The growth of remittances is
envisaged to slow in the medium term. In the long term, also, as the economy develops, more
employment options are available domestically, and migrants abroad lose ties with the home
country, remittances are projected to decline relative to GDP.
The current account deficit is projected to narrow slightly in the medium term, following the
projected deterioration in 2014 and 2015, emanating largely from marked slowdown in the
growth of remittances and stabilize at about 7.7 percent of GDP. It will be financed by FDI that is
expected to reach close to about 4½ percent of GDP in the long run.
The overall budget balance is projected to be a deficit of 2.6 percent of GDP in 2014 and to
increase to 4.7 percent by 2019, under the baseline scenario. Over the long run (2020–2033), the
primary budget balance is assumed to be an average deficit of 2.9 percent of GDP.
Financing assumptions reflect a gradual shift away from concessional financing. Grant equivalent
financing is projected to decline from 2.1 percent of GDP in 2018 to 1.4 percent in 2033. At the
same time, the grant element of new borrowing is projected to fall from 37 percent to 22 percent
during the same period.

5.
While fiscal consolidation, higher exports, and significant levels of remittances should
ensure adequate resources for external public debt service, risks still exist.6 While none of the
indicators of debt service breaches the threshold, some liquidity pressures could emerge. Significant
private external debt and its short maturity represent a risk in case roll-over-rates were to decline
sharply. On the positive side, the improvement in the current account position in 2012 and 2013 has
allowed the NBM to build-up reserves, enhancing the economy’s resilience to adverse exogenous
shocks.

B. Public Sector Debt Sustainability Analysis
6.
Public debt dynamics appear to be sustainable under the baseline scenario, but the
level of PPG total debt is projected to increase over the medium term. With the current set of
macroeconomic policies outlined above, the primary budget deficit path is projected to be wider
than the level that would stabilize the debt-to-GDP ratio. Accordingly, Moldova’s PPG total debt is
expected to increase from 29.8 percent of GDP at the end of 2013 to 39.4 percent by end–2018 and
54.5 percent by 2033. Other sustainability indicators confirm this negative long-term trend under
the baseline scenario. The PV of debt-to-GDP is projected to increase from 24.2 percent in 2013 to
32.6 percent in 2018 and 49 percent in 2033, albeit below the benchmark level of 56 percent.7
Similarly, the PV of debt-to-revenue and grants ratio is projected to deteriorate from 65.4 percent in
2013 to 89.4 percent in 2018 and 134.6 percent by 2033.
7.
Moldova’s public debt trajectory appears to be particularly vulnerable to growth and
primary balance shocks. Although Moldova’s risk of debt distress remains low under the baseline
scenario, standard alternative scenarios presented in the DSA framework highlight a number of
significant vulnerabilities. For example, a permanent one standard deviation in real GDP growth
under the baseline scenario would increase the PV of debt-to-GDP to 58 percent by 2033 and
107 percent in 2033, breaching the 56 percent benchmark level. Therefore, while the DSA framework
points to a low risk of debt distress over the period 2014–19, stress tests indicate that the debt
sustainability is vulnerable to exogenous (growth) shocks and potential fiscal risks. These results
underscore the importance of maintaining prudent fiscal policies over the medium term.
8.
Potential recapitalization needs of the banking system represent an additional risk for
the PPG total debt. If the cost of bank recapitalization were 10 percent of GDP, the stock of public
debt would increase to 41.8 percent of GDP in 2014. Although the PV of debt-to-GDP would be
32.5 percent in 2014, it would increase to 52 percent by 2033, marginally below the benchmark level
of 56 percent (see Table 2a, Bound Test 5).

In Moldova, remittances are classified as either current transfers or compensation of employees. Both categories are
included in the DSA (under “current transfers”).
7

See Revisiting the Debt Sustainability Framework for Low-Income Countries for a discussion of public debt
benchmarks. Moldova’s three-year average score on the Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) is
3.77, which places the country at the upper-end of the medium policy performance category.

C. The Authorities’ View
9.
The authorities concurred with the staff assessment, and agreed that the introduction
of a rule-based fiscal policy framework would help alleviate risks. The authorities acknowledged
that the current fiscal position (as discussed with the IMF 2014 Article IV mission in April 2014) does
not improve debt sustainability. As a response, they proposed to introduce fiscal rules to anchor
fiscal policy and thereby ensure debt sustainability over the long term. The authorities also noted
that short-term debt is mostly related to trade credits and indicated that the country’s ambitious
development plan requires a sustained increase in borrowing. In this context, they would like to
develop a long-term debt management strategy with a focus on exploring alternative sources of
financing while maintaining a sustainable debt level. As part of the strategy to develop the domestic
debt market, the authorities pointed out that the Treasury has started issuing long-term government
bonds and that the NCFM has approved the trading of government securities (with maturity over
one year) on the stock exchange.

CONCLUSION
10.
The DSA indicates that Moldova’s risk of debt distress remains low, in line with the
2012 assessment, but with heightened overall risk. All external indicators for public debt remain
well under the thresholds under the standard bound tests and alternative scenarios. However,
significant private external debt poses roll over risks to debt sustainability. Similarly, although
Moldova’s public debt dynamics are projected to remain on a sustainable path under the baseline
scenario, standard alternative scenarios presented in this assessment highlight particular sensitivity
to assumptions on output growth and the path of fiscal policy.
11.
Pursuing prudent fiscal policy and advancing structural reforms are necessary to
ensure debt sustainability. In view of Moldova’s sensitivity to exogenous developments, the debt
sustainability critically depends on sound macroeconomic management and continued progress on
institutional and structural issues that would help unlock the economy’s growth potential and
reduce its vulnerability to shocks. Furthermore, the limited development of the domestic debt
market poses financing risks, especially considering the country’s developments needs and
significant dependence on foreign assistance in the form of grants and concessional loans. In this
context, efforts to lengthen average maturity of domestic debt and deepen the secondary market
would help reduce the PPG domestic debt rollover and interest rate risks.
12.
A reduction or reversal of trade credit and other private financial inflows could have
an adverse impact on the economy. A possible decline in banking sector liquidity in foreign
countries or deterioration in banking sector confidence could lead to reduced availability of trade
financing. In addition, deterioration in the economic conditions in Moldova’s main economic
partners—where the parent companies are located—could lead to some decline in external
financing for the private sector. All these points to roll-over risks for the private sector.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt. The difference between end-period and average exchange rates account for the difference in external debt ratio presented in Table 1 (SEI) and the DSA.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ǐ(1+g)]/(1+g+ǐ+gǐ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ǐ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
July 8, 2014

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2014 Article IV Consultation and First Post-Program
Monitoring with the Republic of Moldova
On June 23, 2014, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation and First Post-Program Monitoring (PPM) with the Republic of
Moldova.1
Moldova largely achieved the main objectives of the economic program supported by a
combined Extended Credit Facility/Extended Fund Facility (ECF/EFF that expired on April
30, 2013. The country’s economic performance was among the strongest in the region during
2010–13. This was made possible by adequate macroeconomic stabilization measures and
ambitious structural reforms implemented in the wake of the crisis under the Fund-supported
program.
The Moldovan economy recovered strongly from the drought-related contraction of 2012, but
activity will significantly slow in 2014 due to a moderation in agriculture production and
related industries and weaker economic activity in main trading partners. Inflation is
projected to remain within the National Bank of Moldova’s (NBM) inflation target range of
5 percent ± 1.5 percentage points. The external accounts temporarily improved in 2013 but
will deteriorate in 2014. The current account deficit is projected to widen to about 7.5 percent
of GDP resulting from a slowdown in export growth and a decline in remittances.
Moldova achieved an impressive degree of fiscal consolidation under the program, but the
gains have since eroded. The overall budget balance was reduced in 2013 to 1.8 percent of
GDP compared 6.3 percent in 2009, but on current policies is projected to widen to
2.6 percent in 2014 and 4.6 percent in 2015. As a result, public and publicly-guaranteed debt
that reached 30 percent of GDP in 2014 is projected to be on an upward trend over the
medium term.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a
report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

2

Risks to systemic financial stability have built up due to severe governance problems in the
banking system. The ability of regulators to take action is constrained by Constitutional
Court rulings that reduced the powers of the NBM and limited the independence and
effective operation of the National Commission for Financial Markets (NCFM).
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors welcomed Moldova’s strong economic performance and progress on
poverty reduction in recent years underpinned by sound policies. To consolidate these gains
against the backdrop of significant downside risks, Directors encouraged the authorities to
avoid a weakening of policies, reduce vulnerabilities, and deepen structural reforms.
Directors agreed that significant weaknesses in the banking system require decisive action to
ensure the stability and soundness of the financial sector. They urged the authorities to build
consensus and act on the recommendations of the Financial Sector Assessment Program
(FSAP), including to swiftly pass legislation fully restoring the regulatory and supervisory
powers of the National Bank of Moldova (NBM) and the National Commission for Financial
Markets. The legal protection of their board members and staff needs to be strengthened.
Directors also recommended resolutely enforcing compliance with prudential requirements
and strengthening governance in the banking sector, including by ensuring the disclosure of
the ownership structure. Directors supported maintaining the high level of scrutiny of Banca
de Economii’s operations until the bank complies with regulatory norms. They noted that
banks that fail to meet regulatory requirements should be required to implement a timebound plan to address the shortcomings. A further strengthening of crisis management and
the anti-money laundering regime is also warranted.
Directors commended the authorities’ fiscal consolidation in recent years. Nonetheless, they
cautioned that the significant wage and pension increases and ad hoc tax benefits being
planned risk reversing the gains. They encouraged the authorities to pursue a gradual
reduction in the budget deficit to a level compatible with projected official assistance over
the medium term. They stressed the importance of mobilizing revenue and advancing
structural fiscal reforms, including in social security and fiscal decentralization, as well as
adopting a fiscal responsibility law to provide an adequate fiscal anchor.
Directors commended the success of NBM in keeping inflation within the target range in the
past two years. They considered the current monetary stance to be appropriate but

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views
of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any

recommended vigilance to any inflation risks. They welcomed occasional interventions by
the NBM on the foreign exchange market to boost international reserves and reduce
volatility, while stressing the importance of allowing the exchange rate to adjust to external
pressures.
Directors underscored that steady implementation of structural reforms is critical to boost
potential growth and reduce poverty. To increase productivity and improve competitiveness,
priority should be given to improving the business environment, investing in infrastructure,
and strengthening human resource development.

Statement by Mr. Snel and Mr. Manchev on Republic of Moldova
June 23, 2014
Our Moldovan authorities highly appreciate the informative and candid exchange of views
with the mission during the 2014 Article IV consultation and First Post-Program Monitoring
(PPM). They acknowledge that Moldova’s recovery from the severe recession of 2009 was
largely the result of consistent implementation of sound macroeconomic policies and
structural reforms, supported by the last ECF/EFF combined arrangement. The authorities
remain committed to prudent macroeconomic policies, and thank staff for their appraisal.
They remain attentive to the Fund’s advice and recommendations, but emphasize that the
highly uncertain and volatile external and domestic environments pose challenges, which
make it difficult to achieve the broad political and social consensus desperately needed for
smooth and timely policy implementation.
Amid the uncertainty, the authorities make decisive efforts to maintain macroeconomic and
financial stability and to make progress in increasing competitiveness and reducing poverty.
Monetary policy has been successful in maintaining inflation within the target range of
5 percent +/- 1.5 percentage points. In line with the inflation targeting framework, the
National Bank of Moldova (NBM) maintains a flexible exchange rate with limited
interventions in the domestic foreign exchange market to absorb seasonal excess supply, and
prevent disorderly exchange rate movements without resisting market trends. In the context
of disinflationary pressures, the NBM's monetary policy stance has remained appropriate in
building-up international reserves to strengthen resilience to external shocks In consultation
with the IMF, the authorities have prepared amendments to the Law on the NBM to
strengthen its role as a regulator and supervisor, but it appears that more time is needed to
reach consensus in the Parliament and adopt the amendments.
The 2014 the overall government budget deficit target of 2.6 percent of GDP, including
grants, accommodates an increase in resources for social programs, and provides room to
catch up on investment projects which were underexecuted in 2013. The aim of these public
policies is to steadily make well-targeted social programs and infrastructural improvements
the mainstay of the poverty alleviation strategy in line with the National Development
Strategy (NDS) “Moldova 2020”.
The authorities’ near-term plan includes three main pillars: (1) maximum utilization of the
available donor financing, knowledge and institutional support following the technical
completion of a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA) with the EU, without
deviating from the medium-term budget deficit target; (2) increased attention to social issues,
thereby reducing the number of people at risk of poverty or social exclusion through targeted
adjustments in public sector wages, and a move toward well-targeted social programs; and
(3) improving governance of the banking system through implementing some of the FSAP
recommendations.
The remarks below provide additional clarification on: (1) recent macroeconomic
developments; (2) fiscal sustainability; (3) the banking system restructuring; and
(4) structural reforms.

2

Recent Macroeconomic Developments
The near-term outlook is highly unpredictable, and the authorities are well aware that a
disruption of the regional trade routes and/or gas supply can adversely impact the economy.
Recent economic trends have demonstrated Moldova’s distinctive vulnerability to adverse
economic developments in the existing main trading partners. In the first four months of
2014 exports have slowed down by 1.9 percent (y/y), following a decline in exports to the
main partner – the CIS countries - by 9.3 percent (y/y). At the same time, imports have
declined faster - by 3.9 percent (y/y), and the trade balance has improved by 5.5 percent
(y/y). Remittances from Moldovan workers abroad, which are about one quarter of GDP,
have declined, mainly reflecting the slowdown of the Russian economy.
The recent geopolitical and regional developments have also provided Moldova with a
unique opportunity to diversify its trade and financial flows, and thus achieve better
economic sustainability. The establishment of DCFTA may become a turning point for the
low-income economy. Moldova’s exports to the EU have grown by 9.3 percent (y/y) in
January-April, and imports from the EU by 2.4 percent (y/y). In addition, the committed
donor support has reached historically high levels, and is currently equivalent to about
10 percent of total annual budget spending.
These developments, together with a sizable short-term fiscal stimulus to boost domestic
demand, have allowed Moldova’s industrial production to grow by 6.3 percent in the first
quarter (y/y), and investment by 3 percent (y/y). Agricultural production has also responded
positively to a combination of fiscal stimulus and increased official financing. It has grown
by 7.4 percent in the first quarter (y/y). Yet, the authorities are not complacent and stand
ready to respond through further integration into global and energy markets in order to
reduce the impact of shocks in any single trading partner in the medium term.
Fiscal Sustainability
The 2014 budget provides resources to strengthen the authorities’ flagship social programs
for the poorest— “Ajutor Social” and heating allowance—in line with their commitment to
enhance poverty reduction. The authorities have already increased the heating allowance by
25 percent and the minimum monthly income guaranteed by the state (Ajutor Social) by
9 percent. More favorable electricity and gas prices have been negotiated with foreign
suppliers to alleviate expenditure pressures. Provisions in the budget have been made to
ensure that adequate resources become available to protect the purchasing power of retirees,
teachers and some other vulnerable groups.
Given the high uncertainty of the outlook, the authorities are fully committed to the
Medium-Term Budget Framework for 2015–17, and have implemented a number of revenue
mobilization measures. They recognize the importance of structural reforms in ensuring the
medium-term fiscal sustainability, and prepare to enhance privatization and strengthen
market competition when conditions improve in the next few years. With a view to achieve
greater efficiency in the energy sector, and in close cooperation with the World Bank, the

3
authorities have launched a comprehensive restructuring of the centralized heating system in
the Municipality of Chisinau. In line with obligations in the context of signing the DCFTA
with the EU, and to protect local producers from unfair competition stemming from more
advantageous tax regimes in neighboring countries, the authorities have intensified efforts to
fight smuggling and corruption.
Since the onset of the global crisis, the authorities have been facing the daunting task of
striking the right balance between fiscal consolidation and supporting economic growth.
They have already taken steps to strengthen the fiscal policy framework by adopting or
drafting legislation on local public finances, public debt and state guarantees, and fiscal
responsibility. The authorities share staff’s view that further reforms would be needed to
safeguard long-term fiscal sustainability, improve public financial management, increase
resilience to political cycles, and set the stage for further development of domestic capital
markets. Over the medium term, their fiscal policy will continue to be guided by the
objective of reducing the budget deficit to a level that can be sustained without exceptionally
high donor support. The ultimate objective of the authorities’ macroeconomic policies
remains raising living standards and reducing poverty by creating the conditions for strong
and balanced economic growth.
The Banking System Restructuring
The authorities are aware that since the global crisis erupted, the Moldovan banking system
has been operating in a challenging environment. It requires strengthening of the regulatory
framework, corporate governance, and the authorities’ capacity for risk management.
However, building the necessary political consensus and passing adequate legislation to fully
restore the regulatory power of the NBM and National Commission for Financial Markets
has proved to be difficult and will take more time, despite the sizable TA from the Fund. The
authorities will also need more time to discuss the recent FSAP recommendations, and
prepare a comprehensive action plan involving all stakeholders concerned.
Meanwhile, the NBM has imposed enhanced scrutiny of the most affected banks, while
attempting to consolidate the diverging views on the way forward to strengthen risk
management and corporate governance in the sector. Based on the terms of reference agreed
with IMF and World Bank staff, the ailing Banca de Economii has hired an internationally
reputable auditor. A diagnostic study has been recently prepared to facilitate the resolution of
impaired assets and compliance with regulatory norms. The authorities continue to maintain
a strong representation at the BEM’s Board to safeguard the public interest. The NBM also
remains vigilant of developments in other banking institutions and stands ready to
expeditiously address emerging weaknesses with the available instruments.
Structural Reforms
The authorities remain committed to the structural reforms described in the NDS “Moldova
2020”. They recognize that adoption of the DCFTA may pose short-term challenges to the
economy. Against this background, the authorities have developed, together with the EU, a
Roadmap for Enhancing Competitiveness of Moldova, which is also in line with staff’s

4
recommendations. The authorities have also prepared an Education Sector Development
Strategy for 2014–20, aimed at increasing public spending efficiency in the sector and
aligning the curricula of vocational schools with labor market needs.
