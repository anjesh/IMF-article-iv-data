STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
June 28, 2013

KEY ISSUES
Growth and Competitiveness. Kosovo has shown considerable resilience to external
turbulence, posting one of the highest growth rates in the Western Balkans during 2007–12.
Resilience owes to limited financial and export linkages to crisis countries, and robust
remittances and FDI inflows from the Diaspora. While these inflows support incomes and
boost domestic demand, they finance mostly investment in the non-tradable sector and
consumption, and contribute little to the built-up of productive capacity. Policies that could
promote self-sustained growth include improvements in governance and the business
climate, investments in infrastructure and education, and wage restraint.
Fiscal Sustainability. Kosovo’s fiscal position is strong: the budgetary stance is sustainable,
the government’s cash buffers are expected to be restored by the end of this year, and public
debt is low. The challenge ahead is to preserve this strength while addressing pressing social
and capital spending needs. A rules-based fiscal framework would assist these efforts from
2014. Government revenue is collected mostly from VAT, excises, and trade taxes, which is
adequate for now given the import-heavy, transfer-dependent nature of the economy.
However, the tax structure will need to adapt as integration with the European Union
advances and as the economy shifts more toward domestic production.
Financial Sector Development. The banking sector has grown rapidly in the last decade,
starting from a low base. A saturation point appears to have been reached, however, and
further progress will require strengthening the legal and institutional environment.
Notwithstanding their fast growth, banks have avoided funding imbalances typical for many
banking sectors in Central and Eastern Europe. The 2012 Financial Sector Assessment
Program (FSAP) found the banking sector resilient to a wide range of shocks, including
turbulence in the euro area. Commendable steps have been taken to strengthen the financial
safety net.
Previous Staff Advice. In the past two years, macroeconomic policies have been conducted
in the context of a Staff-Monitored Program (in 2011) and a Stand-By Arrangement (from
2012). Many recommendations from the 2011 Article IV consultation were incorporated into
the programs’ design. In particular, the government has restored a sustainable fiscal stance,
progress has been made with the preparation and costing of spending initiatives and the
financial safety net has been strengthened. Further, the authorities have taken worthy
initiatives to strengthen competitiveness and enhance public infrastructure. Progress is
fragile, however, and could be undone by adverse political developments.
The discussions on the 4th review under Kosovo’s Stand-By Arrangement are documented in
a separate report.

BACKGROUND
A. The Setting
1.
Since the 2011 Article IV consultations, Kosovo has taken important steps toward
normalizing international relations. The International Civilian Office overseeing Kosovo’s
supervised independence ended operations in 2012. In December 2012, the EBRD offered
membership to Kosovo, the third large multilateral organization to do so after the World Bank and
the IMF. In April 2013, Kosovo and Serbia signed a normalization agreement that includes a mutual
commitment not to block one another’s efforts to join the EU. Around 100 states have recognized
Kosovo, up from about 70 in 2011. The domestic political environment has remained stable, albeit at
times tense.
2.
Limited export and financial linkages to crisis countries have contained the impact of
the euro area crisis.


Growth performance. Annual real GDP growth averaged 4½ percent between 2007 and 2012,
despite the headwinds from the global financial crisis and euro area turbulence. With this, real
growth was among the highest in the region,

export linkages to crisis countries, and its
exposure instead to Germany and Switzerland, countries in which two-thirds of the Diaspora
reside (Boxes 2, 3). Remittances and FDI from the Diaspora have held up well, and have therefore
continued to support domestic demand.2 By contrast, a robust tradable sector that could
support self-sustained growth has yet to emerge.

3.
In the past two years, macroeconomic policies have been conducted in the context of a
Staff-Monitored Program (in 2011) and a Stand-By Arrangement (from 2012). Major advances

have been made in this period to restore a sustainable fiscal stance, anchor fiscal policy, improve the
preparation and costing of spending initiatives, and strengthen the financial safety net (Box 4).
Further, the government is on-track to restore its cash buffers, provided the sale of the
telecommunications company PTK proceeds as planned. The authorities have also taken worthy
initiatives to strengthen competitiveness and enhance public infrastructure. Progress is fragile,
however, and could be undone by adverse political developments. The Stand-By Arrangement—that
the authorities are treating as precautionary in 2013—expires toward the end of the year.

B. Recent Economic and Financial Developments
4.
Following buoyant growth in 2011, the economy slowed in 2012 and developed
unevenly in the early months of 2013.


Real growth exceeded 5 percent of GDP in 2011, driven by strong investment and private
consumption (Tables 1, 2). The economy slowed in 2012, however, especially during the year’s
second half, with FDI and, correspondingly, private
investment contracting. The slowdown was accompanied
by a deceleration in credit growth from almost 15 percent
in 2011 to 4½ percent (Table 3). Nonetheless, at almost
2½ percent, estimated real growth remained the
strongest in the region. Growth appears to have been
uneven in the early months of 2013: credit, tax collection
and imports all point to stronger demand in the first
quarter, but more muted activity in April and May.



The current account deficit (excluding official transfers)
narrowed from more than 20 percent in 2011 to 15
percent in 2012, reflecting primarily weaker imports (Table 4). The trade deficit remained large at
about 35 percent of GDP in 2012.3



Consumer price inflation moved in line with import prices, notably for food. Core inflation
remained contained at around 2 percent, consistent with
Non-performing Loans to Total Gross Loans
Kosovo’s use of the euro.

5.
The banking sector has remained liquid, profitable,
and well capitalized, although financial strength differs
across banks (Table 5).


3

Non-performing loans increased from 5.7 percent at end2011 to around 7½ percent in late 2012 and early 2013.

The trade balance is the more reliable measure, as the split between transfers and FDI is somewhat artificial. Both
originate with the same source (the Diaspora), are non-debt creating, and differ only by the activity they finance—
consumption or FDI—with insufficient date to allow for a clear distinction.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF KOSOVO

The increase has been concentrated in the corporate sector, arguably reflecting weaker
economic activity. NPLs are low compared to the region, however, and are almost fully
provisioned.




Profitability, as measured by return on assets, halved
between end-2011 and early 2013, but remained solid
compared to peers. The decline reflects higher loanloss provisions and lower credit growth.
System-wide capital adequacy fluctuated around
18 percent for most of 2011 and 2012. It dropped to
around 15 percent in late 2012, as tighter capital rules
under the new banking law—which requires deduction
of related lending from capital and additional capital
buffers for operational risk—took effect.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
6.
The baseline outlook is for a gradual strengthening in activity, in line with expected
developments in Diaspora host countries.


Staff projects real GDP growth of about 2½ percent in 2013, still significantly below the longterm average. Domestic demand is projected to strengthen somewhat, supported by stronger
Diaspora inflows. Exports are also expected to recover, reflecting higher global demand for
metals, although their contribution to growth remains small. CPI inflation is projected to decline
gradually to below 2 percent, reflecting lower prices for imported food stuffs. The authorities
saw upward risk to the growth projections, pointing to anecdotal evidence of import
substitution for consumption goods suggesting higher domestic production.



In the medium-term, staff projects real growth of about 4½ percent, in line with Kosovo’s
average performance of recent years. Although growth would remain driven primarily by
domestic demand, staff projects the very gradual build-up of an export sector, as efforts to
enhance competitiveness bear some fruit. This would yield a modest improvement in the
external balance.

7.
Risks to the outlook relate mostly to the external environment in the short-term, and
to domestic politics in the longer term (Box 5).


6

Contagion from Diaspora host countries. The key short-term risk is a deterioration in
economic conditions in Diaspora host countries that would curtail remittances and FDI, with
negative repercussions for growth—by dampening domestic demand—the public finances—
through lower border tax receipts—and financial stability—as remittances both fund deposits
and are used to repay loans.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF KOSOVO





Bank lending. A related risk are restrictive lending policies
of subsidiaries of euro area parent banks—Kosovo’s three
largest banks are headquartered in the euro area. Such
policies could be triggered by pressures to preserve capital
for the consolidated banking group. However, a possible
decline in their lending activity could be compensated in
part by Turkish and Albanian banks that have gained
market share recently.4

prospects are policies that would undermine
macroeconomic stability and competitiveness. While policy implementation has been
remarkably disciplined in the past two years, the risk of policies that react to short-term political
pressures but can do harm in the longer term is considerable, especially in the context of
electoral campaigns. A case in point are the public sector wage increases of 30-50 percent in the
wake of the 2010 campaign that forced Kosovo’s previous SBA irrecoverably off-track.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Kosovo’s Growth Model and Competitiveness
8.
The authorities and staff agreed that Kosovo’s economy is excessively dependent on
inflows from the Diaspora (Figure 1). While these inflows support incomes, they finance mostly
consumption and investments in non-tradables, such as real estate or services, and contribute little
to the build-up of productive capacity. Goods exports are less than 10 percent of GDP and
concentrated in sectors with a low-value added component, notably metals. This lopsided structure
exposes the economy not only to developments in Diaspora’s host countries, it also casts doubt on
the growth model’s long-term sustainability should the Diaspora become less attached to Kosovo.
9.
While data limitations complicate the assessment of external competitiveness, staff
argued that the available indicators paint an unfavorable picture (Box 6, Figure 2).5 The CPIbased real effective exchange rate (REER) has changed little since the 2011 Article IV consultation,
but its evolution reflects mostly import prices and is therefore of little relevance for

4

See Box 1 of IMF Country Report 13/113 for details. Other banking risks widespread in Emerging Europe are less
pronounced: banking subsidiaries are largely deposit funded, hence there is no risk of parental funding withdrawal.
Asset-side exposure to parents is also minimal, in part because the new banking law prescribes that related party
exposures—including placements with the group—be deducted in full from capital.
5

Data are generally adequate for surveillance and data compilation continues to improve. However, there remain
weaknesses in several areas, including the production-side GDP, labor market data, and external sector statistics. See
the informational annex on statistical issues for details.

There was agreement that a coherent strategy is
needed to improve competitiveness, foster the
development of a tradable sector, and lay the basis for
self-sustained growth. Key pillars of such a strategy
should include (i) investments in infrastructure and
education, (ii) reforms to strengthen the business climate,
(iii) initiatives to support the development of small- and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and (iv) wage restraint
and the maintenance of flexible labor markets—which are
especially critical in view of Kosovo’s unilateral euroization
that limits the authorities’ means to react to shocks.

elevated once scaled with a measure of productivity,
suggesting REER overvaluation.7 Lack of wage
competitiveness is reinforced by structural impediments,
such as a deficient public infrastructure, weak governance,
and a difficult business environment. Unsettled relations
with Serbia and incomplete international recognition also
deter investors.



Almost 40 percent of the government budget is spent on capital expenditures, including the
authorities’ ambitious highway construction program. The government is also working with the
World Bank on upgrading energy supply.



Initiatives to streamline business registration and protect investors that helped Kosovo gain
about 30 ranks in the World Bank’s 2013 ‘Doing Business’ survey. The government has also
initiated a development strategy for SMEs aimed at improving access to finance and enhancing
their competitiveness, in cooperation with donors.



Improvements in the regional political climate and closer integration with the European
Union (EU). In particular, the authorities expect to enter into negotiations for an association and
stability agreement with the EU in the second half of 2013 or early 2014.

6

The CPI-based REER can even mislead: the increase in imported food prices from 2006/07 arguably enhanced the
competitiveness of domestic food producers, but appreciated the REER (for the large share of food in the CPI basket).

7

There is some evidence that remittances increase reservation wages. In this case, elevated wage levels would reflect
real factors rather than nominal rigidities, and could not be addressed through nominal devaluation (that would in
any case require Kosovo to give up the use of the euro).

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF KOSOVO

Staff noted that the success of these initiatives could be undermined by inconsistent, countervailing
measures, such as outsized public sector wage increases.

B. Fiscal Sustainability
12.






In the past two years, Kosovo has restored a sustainable fiscal stance (Table 6).
Structural adjustment. The government implemented adjustment of about 2½ percent of GDP
in 2011-13 through a mix of revenue measures and expenditure-saving structural reforms,
notably in the energy sector. The resulting fiscal stance

GDP.8

Financing. In the medium-term, the fiscal deficit is expected to be financed primarily through
the issuance of securities. The government T-bill market—set up only in 2012—has been off to a
good start, with net issuance of 1½ percent of GDP in 2012, maturities of up to one year, and
nominal yields between ½ and 3½ percent. T-bills have been purchased mostly by domestic
banks. However, it may take a few years until the market will be sufficiently deep to cover the
government’s financing needs in a sustainable manner.

13.
The authorities and staff discussed challenges to revenue policy. Staff argued that the
government revenue structure was efficient, but would require reform as Kosovo integrates more
closely with the EU and shifts toward self-sustained growth.


45

Structure. Government revenue is heavily tilted toward indirect taxes, with more than
80 percent of receipts stemming from VAT, excises, and customs duties. This structure is well
aligned with the import-heavy, transfer-dependent nature of Kosovo’s economy and has proven
revenue effective, owing in large measure to Kosovo’s well-designed VAT system (Box 7).
See Box 3 of the staff report on the 4th review of the SBA.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF KOSOVO



Challenges. Staff suggested that challenges ahead
include (i) replacing customs duties as integration
with the EU advances, and (ii) shifting gradually to
direct taxation as domestic production increases.
The revenue loss from trade taxes could be
replaced, at least in the short term, with VAT, as
Kosovo’s VAT rate is among the lowest in the
region. Strengthening direct taxation, while
desirable, is politically and administratively more
difficult. Options include broadening the income
tax base, reviewing relatively low direct tax rates,
and strengthening the local governments’
use of property taxes.

largely concurred with staff’s analysis, but
emphasized the importance of phasing
gradually in tax losses from upcoming free
trade agreements—notably with Turkey and
the EU. They also pointed to lowering the
VAT threshold as an alternative to rate hikes,
arguing that capacity in tax administration
had increased to a point where this was
feasible.

The relatively small share of social spending reflects in part Kosovo’s three-pillar pension system—only a modest
public “Pillar I” pension is paid out of the budget, while most peers have PAYG-based pension systems. The World
Bank is analyzing public spending patterns in the context of its ongoing Public Expenditure Review.

prevent unfunded spending initiatives. While under the SBA, spending initiatives proceed only
after thorough costing—examples include health reform and increases in the basic pension—there
have repeatedly been proposals for benefits with unknown budgetary impacts. Staff pointed to
examples of neighboring countries where poorly designed benefits had created budgetary burdens
exceeding the financial capacity of the sovereign.
16.
The authorities and staff discussed the adequate level of the government’s bank
balance with the central bank. In Kosovo’s unilaterally euroized economy, the bank balance is the
main tool to safeguard an adequate level of reserves, and therefore to insure both the public sector
and the financial system against liquidity shocks.


SBA yardstick. The yardstick for bank balance adequacy under the SBA—derived from a ruleof-thumb for reserves in countries with a fixed exchange rate—is purposely ambitious, and
results in a recommended balance of about 7 percent of GDP. The authorities noted that the
bank balance had to be approved with each budget, and that a high level was difficult to defend
politically, given urgent capital and social spending needs. They argued that the minimum
inscribed into the fiscal rule legislation—4½ percent of GDP—was more feasible.



Alternatives. While staff saw indeed room for lowering the yardstick relative to the level
recommended under the SBA (Box 8), it encouraged exploring options to fund a higher portion
of reserves from other sources than government deposits, with a view to “depoliticizing” cash
buffers. The proposal of the 2012 FSAP to fund increases in the emergency liquidity assistance
(ELA) facility for banks through a bank premium is a step in this direction. The authorities
agreed, and have started preparatory work on an ELA bank premium (¶18).

C. Financial Sector Development
17.
While Kosovo’s banking sector has grown rapidly in the last decade, weaknesses in
contract enforcement pose an obstacle to future financial development (Box 9, Figure 3).
Kosovo emerged from Yugoslavia’s civil war without a functioning banking sector. In the 2000s,
Kosovo caught up rapidly: credit and deposit growth

Resilience to shocks. The FSAP results suggest resilience of the banking system to a wide range
of shocks, including turbulence in the euro area (Box 10). Pockets of vulnerability remain,
however, primarily from loan and deposit concentrations in some banks, maturity-mismatches,
and external assets exposures.



Supervision. While the FSAP commended the central bank for a high degree of professionalism
in banking supervision, it noted a relatively narrow focus on credit risk. Staff argued—and the
authorities agreed—that this focus was adequate for now, but that a gradual move to
comprehensive risk-based supervision was desirable. Staff also argued in favor of the
development of a macro-prudential policy framework, given Kosovo’s unilateral euroization and
the absence of an independent monetary policy.



Legal and institutional framework. The FSAP noted significant progress since the 2011 Article
IV consultation, notably passage of the Banking Law in 2012 that enhances bank governance
standards and resolution powers, and the establishment of a special reserves fund (SRF) for ELA
under the exclusive control of the central bank. The FSAP recommended steps to further
strengthen the crisis management framework, in particular funding future increases of the ELA
facility through a bank premium.

Most recommendations have since been taken up in the context of the SBA. For technically more
challenging proposals—including risk-based supervision, the macro-prudential policy framework,
and the ELA bank premium—technical assistance is required and is expected to be delivered in the
next 12 months.

STAFF APPRAISAL

Kosovo’s economy has performed remarkably in the face of headwinds from the
global financial crisis and euro area turbulence. Since the onset of the financial crisis in 2007,
annual real GDP growth has never been less than two percent, and average growth has been among
the highest in the Western Balkans. The resilience owes to a confluence of circumstances, however,
that is unlikely to be sustained. Kosovo’s economy depends heavily on FDI and remittances from the
Diaspora that lives mostly in Germany and Switzerland. As these economies have held up well,

The CBK’s 2012 Financial Stability Report found credit risk costs to be a major component of interest rate spreads.
Further, the World Bank’s 2012 Insolvency and Creditor Rights assessment noted legal and institutional weaknesses.
The authorities are working with the World Bank on improving the property registry and NPL resolution, and with
USAID on strengthening the court process for contract enforcement and on establishing a mortgage market.

Diaspora inflows have been stable, and have therefore continued to support household incomes and
domestic demand. Kosovo’s concentrated external exposure would turn into a risk, however, should
the prospects for the Diaspora host countries change, or in case the Diaspora would become less
attached to Kosovo. Insuring against such risks requires the development of a robust tradable sector
that could support self-sustained growth.
20.
Since the 2011 Article IV consultation, Kosovo has taken important steps toward
building a more competitive economy. The strengthening of the investor climate, investments in
public infrastructure, cautious public sector wage policies since 2011, SME development, and a
rules-based framework for setting minimum wage levels11 all point in the right direction, as do
recent steps to normalize cross-country relations within the region and integrate Kosovo closer with
the EU. While there are some indications that these efforts are already bearing fruit—notably
anecdotal evidence about import substitution for consumption goods—enhancing competitiveness
and building a tradable sector is a long-term process that requires patience and stamina from
policymakers. Kosovo’s competitiveness strategy could usefully be reinforced by efforts to
strengthen education and training.
21.
Kosovo has also made large strides toward fiscal sustainability. In the past two years, a
sustainable budgetary stance has been restored through a mix of revenue measures and
expenditure-saving structural reforms. Future budgets would be guided by the rules-based fiscal
framework. However, the framework needs to be complemented by sound fiscal practices, notably
the careful costing and planning of spending initiatives, with respect to both social spending—
where policymakers need to resist temptations to react ad-hoc to spending pressures—and
investment projects, such as the government’s ambitious highway construction program. Otherwise,
unfunded expenditure obligations could rapidly put fiscal achievements at risk. Avoiding such an
outcome is a common responsibility of all stakeholders.
22.
Upcoming challenges to revenue policy require careful preparation. The public sector
relies heavily on indirect taxation, which is appropriate for now given the transfer-dependent,
import-heavy structure of the economy. Looking ahead, however, customs duties will need to be
replaced as Kosovo integrates more closely with its neighbors, including the EU; and the
government will need to strengthen its ability to tax the domestic economy as Kosovo’s growth
model shifts from dependence on transfers to domestic production. The recommendations of an
IMF technical assistance mission from 2011 on tax policy—increasing environmental taxes and
tobacco excises, broadening the tax base and increasing progressivity, and gradually raising income
and property taxes from current low levels—remain topical.12
23.
The government’s bank balance is a critical prudential buffer that needs to be guarded
carefully. The floor on the bank balance inscribed in the rules-based fiscal framework of 4½ percent

of GDP is at the lower range of levels that can be considered adequate. The government should aim
at exceeding this floor when anticipating large payment obligations, such as multi-year investment
projects or debt servicing obligations. The government and the central bank should also continue to
explore options to fund a portion of reserves from non-government sources, notably a premium on
banks to fund future increases of the special reserves fund for emergency liquidity assistance.
24.
Kosovo’s financial sector has grown rapidly in the past decade, but appears to have
reached a saturation point where further progress requires strengthening institutions. Banking
sector depth is now at or even above levels of countries with similar characteristics. At the same
time, credit intermediation spreads remain high, reflecting high credit risk and slow and incomplete
contract enforcement by the judicial system.
25.
Persistent supervisory vigilance, exercised by a strong and independent central bank,
is critical to preserve banking sector stability. Banks display generally adequate capital buffers
and profitability, a modest level of non-performing loans, and high liquid reserves. They have also
avoided funding imbalances typical for many other countries in Emerging Europe. Looking ahead, a
gradual move to comprehensive risk-based supervision and the development of a macro-prudential
policy framework are called for to contain financial risks. Commendable steps have been taken to
strengthen the financial safety net; priorities ahead include the establishment of a permanent
funding mechanism for the SRF.
26.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Kosovo to take place in
accordance with the provision of Decisions No. 14747-(10/96)

Box 1. Kosovo’s Growth Record in Perspective
Kosovo’s economy grew on average by 4.3 percent per year in the past decade (2003-2012), which places
Kosovo at the top of the region. The comparison looks even more favorable when slightly different base
periods are chosen.
Nonetheless, there is a widespread perception that growth has been insufficient to generate
satisfactory improvements in living standards. Several factors may contribute to this perception.


Population growth. At 1.5 percent, Kosovo’s annual population growth was the highest in the region.
Per-capita real GDP grew by 2.8 percent in 2003-12, which does not stand out.

indicator for the improvement in average living standards is real per-capita GDP growth adjusted for the
differential between the increases in the CPI and the GDP deflator.1 This indicator places Kosovo at the
bottom of the region.



Higher prices for food and energy. Food and energy prices increased by even more than the average
CPI, especially from 2007. These items tend to be consumed disproportionately by lower-income
households, suggesting that poorer Kosovars fared worse than the average population.

Box 4. Status of 2011 Article IV Recommendations
Most recommendations were incorporated into Kosovo’s SMP (2011) and SBA (2012/13). Actions taken
include:
Fiscal Policy



A sustainable fiscal stance—consistent with stabilizing public debt at about 30 percent of GDP—was
restored in the context of a 3-year consolidation program.(*) Adjustment measures included structural
reforms to reduce current spending—notably subsidies to the energy sector—and revenue measures,
based on recommendations of a 2011 FAD TA mission.



A rules-based fiscal framework was submitted to the assembly in March 2013, and is expected to be
enacted in early July.(*) It would anchor fiscal policy from 2014.



New spending initiatives are preceded by fiscal impact assessments covering a period of at least
5 years.(*) These include inter alia possible war veteran benefits and highway R6 to Macedonia.



The government is on-track to restore cash buffers, provided the sale of the telecommunications
company PTK to a German-American conglomerate advances as planned.



A government debt market was established in 2012 and has evolved favorably, although its depth
does not yet suffice to cover the government’s financing needs. The Pension Fund Law was amended
in April 2012 to limit exposure of the pillar II pension fund to public debt.(*)

Financial Sector Policies



A new banking law, passed in April 2012, strengthens prudential rules and enhances the ability of the
central bank to resolve financial institutions.(*)



An emergency liquidity assistance (ELA) facility for banks was set up and funded. The Law on Public
Financial Management and Accountability was amended in June 2012 to grant the Central Bank
exclusive control over the ELA facility.(*)



Amendments to the deposit insurance law, passed in December 2012, enhance the target size of the
deposit insurance fund (DIF), and allow the use of DIF-resources for P&A transactions.(*)

Competitiveness and Private Sector Developments



The assembly passed a package of twelve laws to streamline business registration and protect
investors. Kosovo’s rank in the World Bank’s Doing Business improved from #126 in 2012 to #98 in
2013.



The privatizations of PTK (telecommunications) and KEDS (energy distribution) aim at enhancing
infrastructure, as do the construction of highway R7 to Albania (scheduled to be completed in 2013)
and R6 to Macedonia (scheduled to start in late 2013)

Secondary legislation is in preparation to introduce a rules-based setting of minimum wage levels.(*)

Box 8. Euroization, FX Liquidity Needs and Precautionary Cash Buffers
Kosovo is one of only three IMF members that have unilaterally adopted the euro.1/ As a result, every
liquidity need is in foreign exchange (FX), and cannot be satisfied by domestic liquidity generation or
access to ECB facilities. Self-insurance against liquidity shocks requires holding FX reserves.
FX reserves are freely available central bank assets denominated in FX. In Kosovo, all central bank
assets are in FX, hence free availability is the only identifying criterion. The Central Bank of Kosovo (CBK)
considers assets not freely available if they correspond to funds on which non-government entities have a
claim, such as commercial banks’ reserves or deposits of the Kosovo privatization fund.
This renders reserves easier to identify from the liability side of the central bank’s balance sheet. In
Kosovo, reserves are limited to (i) the central bank’s capital, (ii) Kosovo’s SDR allocation received in the
context of the 2009 quota increase, and (iii) the government’s deposits with the central bank. As (i) and (ii)
are fixed in the short-term, (iii), i.e. the government’s bank balance (BB), is the main instrument to ensure
reserves adequacy.
How large should the government’s BB be? Under the SBA, “BB adequacy” is computed as2/
1

10%

30%

.

The first and third terms are fiscal buffers to cover the government’s own liquidity needs, while the second
term is a financial buffer to insure against liquidity strains in banks.
The formula puts the recommended BB at about 7 percent of GDP—a purposely ambitious threshold.
The government has noted that cash buffers of this magnitude are difficult to defend politically. There are
two responses to this concern.
One is that a lower BB requirement could be defended as well. In particular, more than two-thirds of
bank deposits are held with subsidiaries of euro area based banks. In case of liquidity strains, these
subsidiaries would and should arguably turn to their parents who have access to ECB facilities rather than
the CBK. Requiring a reduced liquidity buffer for non euro-area based banks would reduce the minimum BB
to 4½-5 percent of GDP.3/
Another option is to “depoliticize” reserves by financing a larger portion from other depositors than the
government. Specifically, banks could pay a commitment fee to have access to ELA, as recommended by
the FSAP.
1/

The other two are Montenegro and San Marino. Eight IMF members have unilaterally adopted the U.S. dollar,
among them Ecuador, El Salvador, and Panama. Two have adopted the Australian Dollar.

2/

The formula is derived from a rule-of-thumb for reserves adequacy in economies with a fixed exchange rate.
See IMF Board Paper SM/11/31, 2011, “Assessing Reserve Adequacy”.

3/

4½ percent of GDP is also the minimum BB requirement inscribed into the rules based fiscal framework.

Box 9. Financial Sector Development
During the last decade, Kosovo’s banking sector has grown quickly. The banking system has expanded
from six banks to nine (mostly foreign) banks, and private credit as a share of GDP has increased more than
six fold. On the other hand, non-bank financial institutions and securities markets are small. The public
securities market established in 2012 is still nascent.

While still lagging the rest of the Balkans, Kosovo’s banking depth now appears to be above its
structural fundamentals. Whereas in 2003 Kosovo was below its proxy benchmark (i.e., Albania’s expected
median1/) for private sector credit and deposit depth, by 2011 banking depth was higher than income per
capita and population characteristics would indicate.2/
In terms of banking reach and efficiency, the picture is mixed. Reach, as measured by the number of
bank accounts, appears to be roughly in line with Kosovo’s benchmark, while the number of bank
borrowers seems low (which is reflected in large exposures). By contrast, Kosovo’s banking efficiency, as
measured by the interest rate spread, is below its benchmark (i.e., the spread is higher than expected),
reflecting arguably weak contract enforcement and structural characteristics such as bank concentration.

Guide and Benchmarking Methodology, October 2012 (Version 3.0).
2/ As Kosovo is not yet benchmarked in Finstat, Albania, which has similar GDP per capita and population size
and structure, can serve as a proxy, although adjusting for Kosovo’s more dense and younger population would
indicate somewhat lower benchmarks.

Box 10. Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) Stress Tests
The FSAP’s macro-stress tests were based on a scenario of severe euro area deterioration that would
impact Kosovo’s banks through a decline in remittances and FDI, lower values of banks’ holdings of
European sovereign debt, higher counterparty risk from exposures to euro area banks, and a reduction in
credit due to deleveraging by foreign-owned banks. Specifically, GDP would decline by
2 percent, yields on European sovereign bonds would increase on average by 130 bps, and there would be
an average increase in the default probability of European banks to which Kosovo banks are exposed of
140 percent. All stress tests were based on banks’ risk exposures as of June 2012.
The macro stress tests found the banking system to be generally resilient, although there are
pockets of vulnerability:



The two largest banks are resilient. The impact of higher losses on capital adequacy was partially
mitigated by a projected reduction in risk-weighted assets.



The remaining four locally incorporated banks are more vulnerable. Some banks’ capital ratios
would fall below the 12 percent minimum, although the additional capital need would be only
0.2 of GDP.

Sensitivity tests were also conducted, showing again a high degree of resilience. The tests covered
credit concentration, interest rate, foreign exchange, and liquidity risks. Some banks are vulnerable due to
highly concentrated portfolios and to interest rate risk, while exchange rate risk is negligible. Notable
results include:



A default of the three largest borrowers for each bank would cause the banks’ CAR to fall below
12 percent (0.2 percent of GDP additional capital needed).



The default of a parent bank on its liabilities to the subsidiary has one bank’s CAR to fall
below 12 percent (0.1 percent of GDP in additional capital needed). Coupled with the adverse
scenario, the recapitalization need is 0.7 percent of GDP.



A parallel shift of 200 basis points in interest rates would bring two banks—representing more
than 25 percent of the system—below the 12 percent CAR minimum (0.1 percent of GDP
additional capital needed).



The simultaneous withdrawal of the three largest private deposits would cause one small
foreign bank to have a liquidity shortfall (requiring liquidity assistance of around 0.1 percent of
GDP).



A severe liquidity event (i.e., 30 percent outflow, combined with a 20 percent haircut on liquid
assets) would cause 4 banks—3 of which are foreign—to have liquidity shortfalls. Total liquidity
assistance needed would be equivalent to 2.2 percent of GDP. Up to 1 percent of GDP could be
covered by the ELA fund, the amount would increase to 2 percent of GDP if CBK equity and
reserves are included. However, this result does not take into account that some foreign-owned
banks may be able to borrow from their parents.

Data on private external debt is unavailable.
Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in euro terms.
Includes exceptional financing; changes in gross foreign assets; errors and omissions, and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

1/ The most extreme stress test is the test that yields the highest ratio in 2022. In
figure b. it corresponds to a Exports shock; in c. to a Exports shock; in d. to a Exports
shock; in e. to a Exports shock and in figure f. to a Exports shock.
2/ The magnitude of the export shock reflects the variability of prices of metals, which
represented 76 percent of Kosovo's exports in 2010.

Implementation of HIPC Initiative: Not Applicable
Implementation of Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI): Not Applicable
Safeguards Assessments
The latest safeguards assessment of the Central Bank of the Republic of Kosovo (CBK) has been
completed on June 25, 2012. It found that the majority of previous safeguards recommendations
have been implemented. In particular, Audit Committee oversight has been strengthened and
the internal audit department has taken important steps towards full compliance with
international standards. Going forward, the department should now be subject to an external
quality review. To safeguard Fund disbursements used for budget financing, the authorities have
committed in the MEFP to continue existing practice of (i) using the CBK as the sole investment
manager; and (ii) holding all government accounts at the CBK. Separately, to protect the CBK’s
financial autonomy, treatment of any losses incurred as a result of emergency liquidity assistance
was clarified in the law.
Exchange Arrangements
Kosovo does not issue a currency of its own, but uses the euro as legal means of payment.
Kosovo is not part of the euro area and the Central Bank of the Republic of Kosovo is not part of
the European System of Central Banks. Kosovo is an Article XIV member and has not yet
accepted the obligations of Article VIII of the Articles of Agreement.
Previous Article IV Consultation:
Kosovo is on a 24-month consultation cycle during the Stand-By Arrangement. The last Article IV
consultation—which was the first in Kosovo’s history—was concluded on July 6, 2011.
Fourth Review under the Stand-By Arrangement
Discussions took place in Pristina, May 28-June 10, 2013.
FSAP and ROSC Participation:
An FSAP mission was conducted during September 19–October 2 2012. The FSSA included the
ROSC for compliance with Basle Core Principles. Kosovo has not had a data or a fiscal
transparency ROSC.
Technical Assistance
Since 1999, the Fund has provided technical assistance and policy advice to UNMIK under
EBD/99/80 and, since September 2008, to Kosovo under EBD/08/95. Technical assistance has
centered on the Fund’s core competencies, notably in the areas of fiscal policy, the banking and
payments systems, and macroeconomic statistics. Assistance has also contributed to developing

STATISTICAL ISSUES
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is adequate for surveillance and for program monitoring. Performance
criteria can be tested with accuracy. However, the statistical system still suffers from considerable
shortages of financial and human resources.
National Accounts: Improvements have been made to the national accounts, but significant
weaknesses remain. The quality and timeliness of nominal and real GDP data based on the
expenditure approach has been improved. and data is now published in an excel format on the
web-site of the Kosovo Statistical Agency. GDP data based on the production approach are
available, but publication lags are long. Kosovo should also start publishing quarterly GDP data
and a monthly index of industrial production.
Labor Markets: There is limited and unreliable data on the labor force and wages given the large
share of the informal economy. A household survey is currently underway, with preliminary data
for the first half of 2012 having been published in May 2013.
Consumer Price Index: A monthly Consumer Price Index (CPI) has been produced since 2002
and is published on a monthly basis (with a lag of 13 days). The index uses a Classification of
Individual Consumption according to Purpose (COICOP)-compatible item classification with 352
elementary aggregates. The current weights, introduced in January 2012, are based on the data
from Household Budget Survey (HBS) and National Accounts (NA) data by expenditure approach
for 2010. These weights will be used through December 2013. The Kosovar CPI’s item
classification fully conforms to Classification of Individual Consumption According to Purpose
(COICOP).
Government Finance Statistics: Monthly reports on budget execution of the general
government (central government and municipalities) on a cash basis are provided five weeks
after the end of each month. However, budget classification is not consistent with GFSM 2001
because: (i) data is on cash basis, not accrual; (ii) lending for policy purposes (similar to subsidies)
is included after calculating the primary balance; (iii) capital transfers should be included in
current expenditure instead of capital expenditure; (iv) memorandum of understanding (MOU)
should be properly classified depending on their final purpose; (v) annual budget documents
should specify both current and capital spending related to individual projects. Monitoring of
domestic arrears should be strengthened.
Financial Sector Data: Depository corporations (commercial banks and central bank) statistics
starting as of Dec. 2000 are published on monthly basis (with a lag of 25 days). Other financial
corporations statistics starting as of June 2004 are published on quarterly basis (with a lag of 35
days). Data are broadly consistent with the IMF’s Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual

(MFSM), 2000. Due to difficulties with obtaining adequate source data needed for estimation of
Euro currency in circulation, the CBK ceased compiling monetary aggregates in 2006. Financial
soundness indicators are compiled according to the Compilation Guide on Financial Soundness
Indicators (FSI), 2007, and available through STA FSI (starting with July 2010 data). Staff and other
resources are currently sufficient.
External Sector Statistics: CBK provides quarterly balance of payments data. Recently, CBK has
revised its BOP data reflecting improvements in measurement of exports of services, remittances,
and currency in circulation among other items. These revisions are now reflected in the data we
report. Moreover, CBK has recently discontinued publishing trade data, which is now the
responsibility of the Statistical Office of Kosovo (SOK). The latter data is available on a monthly
basis. In October 2012, Kosovo started reporting quarterly IIP data to STA. Overall, the accuracy,
periodicity, and timeliness of balance of payments statistics have improved due to authorities’
efforts and with technical assistance from STA.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation with
Kosovo

On July 15, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Kosovo.1
Kosovo’s economy has displayed resilience in the face of headwinds from the global financial crisis
and euro area turbulence. Since the onset of the financial crisis in 2007, annual real GDP growth has
never been less than two percent, and has averaged 4½ percent between 2007 and 2012, one of the
highest growth rates in the region. The resilience owes primarily to the near-absence of financial or
export linkages to crisis countries, and Kosovo’s exposure instead to Germany and Switzerland,
countries in which two-thirds of the Diaspora reside. Remittances and FDI from the Diaspora have
held up well, and have therefore continued to support domestic demand and finance a wide trade
deficit. Unemployment remains very high at around 35 percent, although much of it reflects arguably
informal employment.
Consumer price inflation has moved in line with import prices, notably for food, but core inflation
has remained contained at around 2 percent, consistent with Kosovo’s unilateral adoption of the euro.
The banking sector has remained liquid, profitable, and well capitalized, although financial strength
differs across banks.
In the past two years, macroeconomic policies have been conducted in the context of a StaffMonitored Program (in 2011) and a Stand-By Arrangement (from 2012). In this period, the
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every
year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the
country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the
basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of
the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An
explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

authorities have restored a sustainable fiscal stance, improved the preparation and costing of
spending initiatives, and strengthened the financial safety net. From 2014, fiscal policy would be
anchored by a rules-based fiscal framework, expected to be enacted in July of this year. Further, the
government is on-track to restore its cash buffers, provided the sale of the telecommunications
company PTK proceeds as planned later this year. The authorities have also taken initiatives to
strengthen competitiveness and enhance public infrastructure. The Stand-By Arrangement—that the
authorities are treating as precautionary in 2013—expires toward the end of the year.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended Kosovo’s resilience to external turbulence, owing mainly to prudent
policies and robust remittances and FDI inflows from the diaspora. Directors noted that looking
ahead, it will be important to reduce dependence on these inflows and develop a robust tradable
sector that can support self-sustained growth.
Directors welcomed the efforts to enhance competitiveness. They encouraged continued commitment
to improving the business climate, strengthening investments in public infrastructure and education,
and increasing regional integration. Maintaining wage restraint and flexible labor markets and
initiatives to support small- and medium-sized enterprises will reinforce these efforts.
Directors recognized the important steps taken by the authorities to restore fiscal sustainability. The
challenge ahead is to preserve this strength while addressing pressing social and capital spending
needs. In this context, Directors welcomed the development of a rules-based fiscal framework that
will anchor fiscal policy from 2014. They stressed that careful budgetary planning and costing of
spending initiatives, while resisting ad hoc spending pressures, will remain critical.
Directors considered the heavy reliance on indirect taxes to be appropriate given the economy’s
transfer-dependent structure. However, they emphasized that revenue policy would need to adjust as
Kosovo integrates more closely with its neighbors and as the growth model shifts from dependence
on transfers to domestic production. Directors agreed that the government’s bank balance with the
central bank needs to be guarded carefully as a critical prudential buffer to insure the economy
against fiscal and financial shocks.
Directors noted that the banking system is liquid, profitable, and well capitalized. They also noted
with satisfaction progress made with implementing key FSAP recommendations. To promote further
financial sector development, Directors saw a need to strengthen the legal and institutional
environment, in particular to expedite contract enforcement by the judicial system. To further reduce
risks in the banking system, Directors recommended a gradual move to comprehensive risk-based
supervision, the development of a macro-prudential policy framework, and the creation of a
permanent funding mechanism for the special reserve fund for emergency liquidity assistance.

Statement by Mr. Johann Prader and Mr. Omer Yalvac on Republic of Kosovo
July 15, 2013
On behalf of our Kosovar authorities, we thank staff and Management for the fruitful
policy discussions and support during the 2013 Article IV consultations and the
fourth review under the Stand-by Arrangement. These exchanges of views are very
helpful for the authorities when designing their policies.
Since the last review in April, there have been very positive developments in terms
of relations with the European Union (EU). On April 19, 2013, the governments of
Kosovo and Serbia completed an agreement that would allow both countries to
apply for EU membership, a significant improvement towards normalizing relations.
Following this major step, there were rounds of talks between delegations from both
countries. On June 28, 2013, the European Council announced the decision to begin
negotiations for a Stabilization and Association Agreement (SAA) between the
Republic of Kosovo and the EU. The SAA is the first contractual agreement between
the Republic of Kosovo and the EU which provides a perspective for Kosovo’s full
membership. The start of negotiations for an SAA with the EU bodes well for the
country’s economic prospect.
The Article IV report’s findings illustrate that the economy has performed strongly,
despite headwinds from the global financial crisis and turbulence in the euro area.
Growth has continued to stay over 2 percent since 2007 and average growth has
been the highest among peer countries. Macroeconomic fundamentals have been
strengthened with the support of the Stand-by Arrangement. Very limited financial
and export linkages to countries most affected by the euro area crisis and strong
remittances from Germany and Switzerland have positively contributed to Kosovo’s
growth prospects.
Growth Outlook
The economy is expected to gradually accelerate throughout 2013 and continue
along the path to 4.5 percent growth over the next few years. In the coming period,
favorable demographics, the strong banking sector, remittances, and foreign direct
investment will be important pillars for strong growth performance. There are
encouraging signs in terms of an increase in domestic production, which substitutes
imports for domestic consumption. Improvements in competitiveness and continued
support from the Diaspora are expected to boost the economy’s medium-term
growth prospects.
The authorities are mindful of the need to increase the economy’s productive
capacity for sustainable growth. To this end, the authorities have committed to
strengthening infrastructure, improving the business climate, and increasing regional
integration. In order to improve infrastructure, budget spending has focused mainly
on capital expenditures. With regard to the business climate, the authorities continue

2
to develop the business environment beyond achieving a significant improvement in
the World Bank’s 2013 Doing Business survey. As an important step, the Kosovar
authorities have initiated a development strategy for small and medium enterprises
(SMEs) which could improve their access to finance and enhance competitiveness.
For more regional integration, the authorities are gearing their efforts towards
entering into negotiations for a Stabilization and Association Agreement with the EU.
Fiscal Policy
The authorities have been cognizant of the importance of strong fiscal balances in a
highly uncertain global environment. Fiscal adjustment was implemented through a
mix of revenue and expenditure measures. The authorities are keen on maintaining
the sustainable fiscal stance with the help of prudent policies in capital spending. To
this end, a rules-based fiscal rule will be in place starting from July 2014. The rule
has been designed to keep the general government deficit as well as gross public
debt under control. In order to support the economy’s growth potential, capital
projects are exempt from the ceiling; depending on the privatization receipts and the
level of the government bank balance. The authorities attach utmost importance to
the level of the government bank balance, which is critical to safeguarding an
adequate level of reserves that would insure both the public and financial system
against liquidity shocks. Taking Kosovo’s development needs and prudent fiscal
policies into consideration, 4.5 percent of GDP seems to be feasible for the
adequate level of government bank balance. Nevertheless, the authorities are aware
of the need for targeting higher levels due to multi-year investment projects or debt
servicing obligations.
Financial Sector
The 2012 FSAP findings revealed that the banking sector has remained liquid,
profitable, and well-capitalized. Although there is an increase in non-performing
loans (NPLs), they are comparably low and almost fully provisioned. The banking
authority is monitoring the risks stemming from weaker economic activity. The return
on assets is one of the highest in the region. The capital adequacy ratio of the
system is around 15 percent, the effect of tighter capital rules under the new banking
law. The banking subsidiaries of euro area banks are largely deposit-funded and
there is limited risk of deleveraging. Lending activity is also expected to be
supported by new banks in the system.
The authorities are closely following the 2012 FSAP recommendations to strengthen
the oversight of the financial sector. In this regard, the authorities have started
numerous initiatives in supervision and in the legal and institutional framework.
Recently, they began a study on an emergency liquidity assistance facility for banks
through a bank premium. They are also working with other international
organizations and donors on improving the property registry and NPL resolution, the
court process for contract enforcement, and establishing a mortgage market. Once

3
completed, these initiatives will positively contribute to the growth performance and
the banking sector.
Structural Reforms
The authorities are keen on strengthening the competitiveness of the economy.
Despite improvements in many areas, public infrastructure – notably energy and
transport – are the main challenges to a better investment environment. The high
level of capital spending is expected to close the gap and improve public
infrastructure. Additionally, the authorities have learned the lesson of the huge public
sector wage increases related to the 2010 election campaign and therefore pay due
regard to the importance of cautious public sector wage policies and a rules-based
framework for setting wage levels to improving competitiveness.
Program Performance and Next Steps
The authorities have shown strong commitment to the program targets. All end-April
quantitative performance criteria were met. All continuous performance criteria and
most applicable structural benchmarks were also met. Although indicative targets on
the nonaccumulation of domestic payments arrears by the central and general
governments were not met, they were missed only by small margins and corrective
actions were taken. The authorities are ready to take further measures, as needed,
to safeguard compliance with the program targets.
The authorities are keen on maintaining sound fiscal policies. The 2013 budget
execution has been in line with program targets. In order to keep up with the targets,
the authorities have submitted the mid-year budget to the assembly, in line with prior
actions and supporting measures. The fiscal rule, which is a critical pillar for the
program, is planned to be finalized by parliament in early July 2013 to be in place for
the 2014 budget. Under the guidance of the rules-based fiscal framework, the 2014
budget will be submitted to the assembly in line with program targets.
The authorities continue to further strengthen financial sector surveillance in parallel
with FSAP recommendations. The authorities will improve the crisis management
framework and institutional capacity. The establishment of the National Council on
Financial Stability and Crisis Management will be instrumental in following up and
working on key FSAP recommendations.
The authorities are attaching utmost importance to competitiveness and structural
reforms. With regard to improving infrastructure, they are committed to the
preparation of the planned highway R6 to Macedonia by limiting risks to public
finances and safeguarding economic viability. In order to limit risks stemming from
wages, the authorities will issue an administrative instruction in coordination with the
Fund and World Bank staff. The Kosovar authorities will continue projects with
international organizations and donor institutions to improve access to finance for
SMEs.
