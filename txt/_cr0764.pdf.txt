ITALY
Staff Report for the 2006 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by Staff Representatives for the 2006 Consultation with Italy
Approved by Michael Deppler and Michael Hadjimichael
January 16, 2007
Executive Summary
Background: The economy is enjoying a broad-based cyclical upswing. Output growth in
2006–07 looks set to be the strongest since 2001. Unemployment is falling, inflation is
broadly on a par with the euro-area’s, and there are initial signs that structural transformation
may be underway. The 2007 budget seems well set to bring the fiscal deficit below 3 percent
of GDP, thanks also to stronger-than-expected revenues in 2006. But the politics are difficult:
the government’s majority is thin and some coalition partners resist market-oriented reforms.
Challenges: Despite progress in several areas, the upswing masks fundamental problems:
insufficient domestic competition, still-rigid labor markets, a discouraging business
environment, relatively undeveloped capital markets, and unsustainable fiscal accounts. Lax
fiscal policy and hesitant structural reform efforts have fostered a prolonged period of anemic
productivity, weakening competitiveness, and stagnant growth.
Staff views: The current environment is probably “as good as it gets” for the reforms needed
to enhance Italy’s growth potential—if not now, when? Although a start has been made—
with a set of liberalizing reforms in July 2006 and appreciable deficit reduction over 2006–
07—much remains to be done. Main requirements are sustained expenditure-based fiscal
consolidation (the 2007 budget relies excessively on higher revenues), supported by
modernized budget processes; decisive action to foster domestic competition; a second wave
of labor reform; and a deepening of corporate bond and equity markets.
Authorities’ views: While broadly agreeing with the staff’s analysis, the authorities believe
staff underplays recent efforts, given also the political constraints. They see the 2007 budget
as an important first step toward medium-term expenditure restraint, and the structural
reform process as being on track. On specific policies, the main disagreement is on labor
market reform where concerns about nontraditional employment contracts are driving
proposals to constrain their use.

I. BACKGROUND: A PROPITIOUS SETTING FOR ADJUSTMENT AND REFORM
1.
A cyclical upswing is underway. After four sluggish years, growth recuperated to
about 2¼ percent during the first three quarters of 2006 (annualized), as exports finally got
some lift from the global expansion, feeding a recovery in fixed investment and employment,
and underpinning continued moderate consumption growth. The current pick-up is notably
more broad-based and balanced between domestic and foreign sources than the previous
aborted recoveries of 2003–04.
2.
But the recovery masks Italy’s longer-term low-growth malaise. Potential growth
rates have declined from around 4 percent in the early 1970s to about 1¼ percent currently.

where the productivity gap relative to France and Germany is striking. Recent reforms of
labor contracts have led to a significant increase in employment, but have not translated into
higher output due to declining productivity growth. As a result, Italy continues to lose
competitiveness. Economic rigidities, along with Italy’s historic specialization in products
with relatively low value added, contributed to a steady erosion of competitiveness, reflected
in a substantial loss of export market share (Box 1).

participation rate has remained at 63 percent since 2003.

Box 1. Italy’s Dwindling Competitiveness1
Italy has steadily lost export market share since the early
1990s. Based on national accounts data for real exports of
goods and services, Italy’s market share declined some
38 percent since 1993, versus 2 percent for the euro area as a
whole.2 Constant market share analysis suggests the bulk of
Italy’s market loss has been due to deteriorating price
competitiveness.

exchange rate has appreciated by some 20 percent since
1998—generally considered a benchmark year—and 2005.
However, establishing a benchmark year is not without problems and staff used complementary (CPIbased) methodologies to estimate Italy’s competitiveness gap at end-2005, including a current account
(macroeconomic balance) approach, a reduced-form equilibrium real exchange rate approach using
determinants drawn from cross-country panel data analyses (net foreign assets relative to exports, terms
of trade, labor productivity, and government consumption), and an external sustainability approach.
Though such methodologies have known shortcomings with the results contingent on the assumptions
and subject to estimation errors, they suggest a competitiveness gap in the range of 5 to 8 percent.

In value terms, Italy’s market share declined by 23 percent in the same period.

4.
There are initial signs of
structural transformation. A recent pickup in exports in value terms, including in
some traditional sectors and in highly
competitive emerging markets, suggests that
the initial stages of transformation to higher
value-added goods may be unfolding. And
anecdotal evidence suggests that Italian
firms have begun to outsource to enhance
their competitiveness, although they remain
behind regional competitors in this process.

general government deficit, net of two large
one-off operations,4 is estimated by staff to have declined to 3.0 percent of GDP in 2006
(versus an original budget target of 3½ percent of GDP), implying an appreciable withdrawal
of fiscal impulse. The headline deficit, however, is estimated to have risen to 5.0 percent of
GDP.
6.
The 2007 budget seems likely to meet the thrust of Italy’s EDP obligations. The
budget targets a headline deficit of 2.8 percent of GDP and, in official calculations, a
cumulative underlying adjustment of 1½ percent of GDP in 2006–07. In staff’s view, even
discounting the yield of certain measures, the more favorable base given by the 2006
overperformance should ensure that the headline target is met, although staff’s estimate of
underlying adjustment is less (some 1 percent of GDP). After rising in both 2005 and 2006
(partly due to the VAT repayments), the public debt/GDP ratio is projected by staff to remain
broadly unchanged in 2007, at around 107 percent.

Despite the government’s commitment, the 2007 budget does contain a limited amnesty for social security
contributions to facilitate the emergence of irregular work situations.

A Selected Issues Paper looks into the structural causes of spending growth.

Namely the European court-mandated refund of VAT collected on the sale of company cars and the
government’s assumption of railroad-related debt, amounting to some 2 percent of GDP.

Part of the spending growth appears to stem from euro-area wide convergence in current primary
expenditure/GDP ratios, of which there is some evidence. In Italy the initial level of such spending was
lower than the euro-area average, though health care spending has now caught up, and the pension and
public wage bills are significantly above those of the euro area. Also, the pronounced decline in longterm interest rates over the past decade cut the cost of capital (especially for high-debt countries) and
facilitated investment spending.
But the rise in primary spending also reflects missed opportunities from the lower interest bill,
combined with Italy-specific policy slippages.
•

The large fall in the interest bill in high-debt countries was ultimately used for new spending,
rather than deficit reduction.

•

Italy incurred significant overruns relative to own-spending targets, explaining much of the
deficit slippages in 2001–05.

•

With social spending growth contained by pension reforms, other current spending (notably on
wages and goods and services) rose rapidly since the late 1990s, partly reflecting the lack of a
comprehensive expenditure framework.

7.
Financial conditions remain sound. Bank profits have edged up and the quality of
their loan portfolio has improved. Household balance sheets remain robust despite doubledigit consumer credit growth over the past few years. Household debt, at 34 percent of GDP,
is well below the euro-area average. Despite the recent up-tick in servicing costs,
delinquency rates are low. Corporate leverage also increased as corporations locked in low
interest rates. The October 2006 downgrading of Italian sovereign debt had a minimal impact

on long-term spreads, which remain—at about 30 basis points relative to German Bunds—
somewhat lower than during the period surrounding the April 2006 elections. Continued
lengthening in the average public debt maturity has further reduced the sensitivity of debt
service to upward interest rate movements.
8.
Staff expects growth to slow from 1.7 percent in 2006 to 1.4 percent in 2007.
Continued moderate consumption growth would be supported by increased disposable
income, employment gains, and healthy balance sheets. Investment growth seems set to
decelerate but remain positive, sustained by domestic and foreign demand, increases in
capacity utilization, and favorable financing conditions. The contribution of net exports
would again be flat.
9.
The risks to the outlook appear broadly balanced. The authorities saw slowing
partner country growth, including a sharper than expected slowdown in the United States,
and an unwinding of global imbalances that entailed euro appreciation as the main downside
risks. Staff and other observers also noted the risk of adverse confidence effects provoked by
the 2007 budget’s reliance on the revenue side. Upside risks stem from the ongoing
economic restructuring, which some observers—while recognizing the lack of hard data—
view as relatively advanced.
10.
Inflation is set to hover slightly above 2 percent. Although headline CPI inflation
recently edged down to 2 percent thanks to declines in oil prices and base effects, core
inflation edged above that of the euro area, to 2 percent. The relatively high level of inflation
in Italy suggests that the staff’s estimate of economic slack could be overstated, at least in the
labor market. Thus, while staff projects wage growth of 3 percent in 2007, the possibility of
generous wage increases in the public sector, with a demonstration effect on the private
sector, could threaten this outlook.
11.
The politics are difficult. The recently elected center-left government’s
parliamentary majority is thin and the coalition comprises a broad spectrum of economic
views, ranging from a committed reformist core to parties resistant to market-oriented
reform. Although the government has overcome the budget hurdle, this has not been without
concessions, and the outlook for fundamental fiscal adjustment and economic reform remains
uncertain, with market concerns reflected in the credit ratings downgrades.

Converting the current cyclical upswing into sustained growth and fiscal
adjustment will require advancing on a broad front, stressed in previous Fund advice.
Within this overarching theme, the Consultation discussions—the first with the new
government—focused on using the start of the government’s term and the cyclical upswing
to:
•

embark on and sustain expenditure-based fiscal consolidation;

•

return to growth by stepping up structural reforms;

•

further develop the financial system, while maintaining financial stability.
II. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. “If not now, when?”

13.
The government has committed to strengthen the fiscal accounts and undertake
competition-enhancing reforms, but deeds have not fully kept pace with words. In staff’s
view, the 2007 budget puts too little emphasis on expenditure control and—after a promising
start—the structural reform process still has to gain momentum and strategic coherence. The
authorities contested this view, both in its substance (seeing the 2007 budget as an important
first step on the medium-term consolidation path, and the structural reform process as being
on track), and in its approach, arguing that the yardstick for assessing the government’s
action should reflect a pragmatic, tempered balance between what is desirable and what is
feasible, with critics (including staff) focusing unrealistically on the former
14.
In staff’s view, the current environment is likely to prove “as good as it gets” for
needed reforms. International experience indicates that structural reforms are best enacted
early in a government’s mandate. Furthermore, a cyclical upturn marked by significant
revenue overperformance constitutes a highly supportive setting for fiscal adjustment. While
deferring on the assessment of the political constraints, staff shared the approach set out in
the government’s ambitious medium-term economic program of July 2006—centered on
expenditure control in key areas and competition-enhancing reforms—and argued for early
action exploiting the window of opportunity now open.

A series of pension reforms has significantly improved longterm fiscal sustainability, but some key reform elements have
not yet been implemented.
Significant progress only on narrowing the historically large
stock-flow discrepancy. Budget process remains tortuous and
nontransparent, with little accountability for results.

The 2007 budget

spending pressures, it saw these
as falling short of realizing the commitment in the government’s medium-term economic
program of countering these pressures comprehensively in the key areas that account for the
bulk of spending—public administration, local authorities, health care, and pensions.
•

Public administration. The budget incorporates plans for reorganizing the public
sector, reducing ministerial offices, eliminating duplication, regrouping agencies from
a provincial to a regional level, and gradually reducing public employment. The
authorities recognized that key to success lies in securing increased mobility in the
civil service, which could not be legislated but would be pursued with the trade
unions in early 2007. Staff noted that the resulting savings risked being largely offset
by relatively generous wage renewals and large-scale conversions of temporary
contracts to open-ended employment.

•

Local authorities. A new Domestic Stability Pact replaces expenditure ceilings with
explicit deficit targets, and grants local authorities greater taxing leeway, while
cutting state transfers. The authorities rebuffed arguments that these measures will
mostly operate through higher local taxes, since local authorities could (and should)
increase efficiency and cut spending. There was agreement that attaining full-fledged
fiscal federalism will require further institutional steps—under preparation—to
reconcile local autonomy with fiscal responsibility.

•

Health care. In September 2006, the government signed a potentially promising new
“health pact” with the regions, establishing multiyear financing envelopes to increase
budgetary certainty, and undertaking various cost–saving initiatives. Regions in
breach of their healthcare spending limits and failing to take sufficient corrective
measures have been made subject to automatic increases in some regional tax rates

17
(as envisioned in the 2006 budget)—a measure expected to exercise a particularly
effective disciplining role in the five affected regions.
•

Pensions. The budget raises contribution rates for the self-employed, but contains no
cost-saving measures in this area. Rather, in September 2006, the government signed
a Memorandum of Understanding with the trade unions setting out broad principles
and a number of potentially constructive commitments (regarding, for example,
incentives to lengthen the average working life and links to demographic
developments) for additional pension reform by March 2007. Staff stressed that any
agreement would need, at the least, to fully preserve the financial impact of already
approved reforms5 and help raise the still very low elderly participation rates,
contributing to enhance potential growth. The budget also brings forward steps to
promote private pensions savings, originally due to come into effect in 2008.

16.
The authorities argued that the 2007 budget initiated more medium-term
spending restraint than generally recognized or than most previous budgets. They felt
that much of the criticism failed to consider some key constraints. First, the difficulty of the
inherited situation, in the form of unrealistic spending ceilings, and consequent overruns, in
the 2006 budget. And second, the short-term rigidity of spending, and the related fact that
longer-term structural reforms are the real key to growth and fiscal sustainability, a process
they intend to pursue in 2007. Even so, the authorities argued that appreciable progress was
implied on the spending side—arresting the rising trend of current primary spending and
broadly stabilizing its ratio to GDP in 2007.
17.
The authorities also noted that many of the revenue items in the budget were
worthy initiatives in their own right:
•

5

A significant portion of the revenue increase was expected to come from measures to
reduce tax evasion and avoidance, and which—apart from equity considerations—
would yield important efficiency gains and did not involve an increase in tax rates.
The authorities have also committed to reduce tax rates in the future in parallel with
gains from the proposed measures.

Two legislated changes to the pension system remain to be implemented: (i) the adjustment of pension
replacement rates in line with developments in life expectancy (mandated to take place every ten years under
the 1995 “Dini” reform, but not implemented in 2005); and (ii) a step increase in the retirement age for seniority
pensions (from 57 to 60), set to occur in 2008 under the “Tremonti-Maroni” reform of 2004.

18
•

The planned unification of tax rates for final withholding on various types of financial
income would remove distortions in the tax system.

•

The cut in the tax on labor would help enterprise competitiveness.

Thus, rather than constraining medium-term growth prospects, these measures were in the
authorities’ view likely to enhance economic efficiency and growth potential.
18.
While welcoming measures to broaden the revenue base, staff urged greater
reliance on expenditure restraint and enhancing its quality. Evidence from around the
world clearly shows that, to be successful and durable, fiscal adjustment needs to be based on
curbing current expenditure, not raising revenue, partly because of the confidence-dampening
impact an increase in the tax burden can have6—and to allow a concomitant reduction in tax
rates, while safeguarding deficit reduction. Also, a higher revenue-to-GDP ratio risks
providing leeway for additional spending. Staff noted that there was considerable scope for
enhancing the effectiveness and efficiency of individual spending programs—a point shared
by the authorities.
19.
Staff took exception to the redirection of workers’ severance fund flows being
treated as “adjustment.” The budget contains a measure—designed to promote
supplementary pension savings—whereby workers’ contributions to firm-based severance
funds would automatically be directed to a private pension fund (in most cases, an
occupational pension fund) in 2007, unless the worker explicitly opts for another pension
fund or for continued accumulation of severance funds. In the latter case, and for firms with
over 50 employees, contributions (recorded as revenue in the fiscal accounts) would accrue
to a special account at the Social Security Institute, to be used to finance public
infrastructure. Staff noted that such flows (estimated at 0.4 percent of GDP in 2007) give rise
to a liability to provide workers with severance payments in the future, and their diversion to
the state would furthermore be costly (as the government is to match not only the previous
return on such funds but also compensate enterprises for the loss of cheap financing).

Research in this area has in the event been spearheaded by Italian academics (including Alesina, Perotti,
Tabellini and others); for an international overview see, “Experience with Large Fiscal Adjustments,” IMF
Occasional Paper, No. 246.

19
Longer-term fiscal sustainability
20.
Achieving long-term sustainability means going beyond EDP targets. Staff
projections show that without deficit reduction beyond

21.
The mission called for a multiyear spending framework with clear targets for
outer years, backed by structural expenditure-saving measures. Such measures should be
defined soon to be effective before the next budget round, with the aim of bringing the fiscal
accounts into balance at least by 2010. Without such measures, Italy’s reentry below the
Maastricht threshold could be short-lived: indeed, staff projects a deficit of 3.0 percent of
GDP in 2008, and official forecasts also see the deficit creeping back up to 2.9 percent of
GDP in the absence of further measures. A credible framework to ensure that any revenue
overperformance be used for deficit reduction would also help.
22.
The authorities’ medium-term plan envisages reducing public debt to below
100 percent of GDP by 2011. This is to be done essentially by rebuilding the primary
surplus—now negative (partly reflecting one-off factors)—to just under 5 percent of GDP
by 2011; the medium-term plan does not contain any explicit assumptions about debt
reduction via privatization or asset sales. The authorities explained that while sales of public
equity and other assets would proceed as and where possible (with some being planned
for 2007), they viewed skeptically the feasibility of large-scale operations being studied by
the previous government. They furthermore did not wish to nourish any illusion of an “easy”
solution beyond the hard work of rebuilding a sufficiently large primary surplus. They
nonetheless shared staff’s call for continued public divestment and for deep restructuring of
several financially distressed public enterprises (Box 4). 7

criteria identified in “Public Investment and Fiscal Policy—Lessons from the Pilot Country Studies,” IMF

Baseline scenario – debt explosion. The baseline assumes current policies through 2010 and thereafter
keeps revenue and non-age-related spending ratios to GDP constant. Age-related spending reflects the
authorities’ demographic projections and recent pension reforms (part of which remain to be
implemented). Given unchanged

The medium-term TFP growth
would slightly lag labor productivity, but its estimation is hampered by significant data uncertainties. In
any case, the growth in labor productivity would have to be supported by a combination of fairly modest
employment gains and strong gross fixed capital formation. Under these assumptions, the fiscal deficit
would decline over the next few years, but would rise thereafter, due to increased aging-related spending
and, later, interest payments. The debt ratio would explode to almost 300 percent in 2050. In addition,
failure to implement already legislated pension reforms would lead to even more explosive debt
dynamics (Table 5).

Adjustment scenario – debt stabilizes below the Maastricht threshold. The staff’s adjustment

between the two scenarios derives

from the accumulated difference in
the fiscal balance through 2010 and
the (upward) impact of (slower)
growth on the pension/GDP ratio. These results underscore that achieving debt sustainability depends on
both further fiscal consolidation and growth-promoting structural reforms.

21
Box 4. Fiscal Risks from Italy’s Public Enterprises
Italy’s once vast public enterprise sector has been significantly reduced over the last two decades.
In 1992, 12 of the 20 largest Italian firms (by sales) were state-owned, and the state’s holding companies
were among the largest employers in the country. Despite being sheltered by legal monopolies and
enjoying exclusive state concessions, the vast majority were unprofitable. Enabled by legislative and
institutional changes, about 80 major privatizations, totaling some €125 billion, were completed
during 1993–2005. Receipts were channeled to the Debt Retirement Fund, created in 1993, significantly
reducing public debt.
The state’s current portfolio includes holdings in four listed companies and some twenty unlisted
companies. The listed companies are performing well, with the notable exception of the airline company
Alitalia; their market value was estimated at €32 billion (about 2 percent of GDP) at end-October 2006.
Unlisted companies operate in various sectors; the Ministry of Economy and Finance intends to divest
the most profitable over the next few years (with an estimated value of about 2 percent of GDP).
However, the road company (ANAS) and the railway holding company (FFSS) are running losses
financed by state transfers and reserve drawdowns.
These companies’ shaky finances pose fiscal risks. Even if the government, according to corporate
law, would not be directly responsible for their liabilities in case of default, it is likely that these
companies, that jointly employ more than 100,000 workers, would be considered “too big to fail.” At the
same time, the government has also been transferring risks to these companies, by cutting their capital
transfers (deep cuts in the 2006 budget had to be reversed with midyear supplementary allocations when
they proved unfeasible). While needed restructuring will take time, early steps to secure timely reporting
and enhanced transparency of these companies’ operations will be key to any reform effort.

23.
Reform of the tortuous budget process is critical. This is widely agreed, in good
part because of the following considerations:
•

The budget’s unwieldy “omnibus” presentation, fragmented into thousands of budget
forecasting units, and set out in various documents using different aggregations and
accounting methods, renders it inaccessible to most and fails to provide a clear picture
of government finances even to the initiated.

•

These same features—combined with a complex approval process and delays in the
availability of some key documents—also render the budget almost impossible to
approve in line with the parliamentary schedule, leading to systematic recourse to
confidence votes, even by governments with comfortable majorities.

•

Budget preparation and execution is focused on legal compliance rather than on
efficiency and quality of public services, with a related lack of accountability for
results.

22
Momentum is thus building for budget reform, including a move to performance-based
budgeting.8 Staff also called for improvements in the timeliness of some key budget
documents and for greater institutional independence of budget assessments and projections.
The authorities are pursuing some initiatives designed to enhance independence of fiscal
analysis, largely based on the existing institutional framework.
C. Returning to Growth
Stepping up structural reforms
24.
There was agreement on many areas of structural reform needed to address
insufficient competition and overregulation, but not on labor markets. The OECD
reports that Italy has the most highly regulated product markets in the EU-15, and various
cross-country reviews identify excessive regulation as a continuing problem in key sectors,
accounting also for Italy’s undersized services sector and high energy prices. In part due to
these problems, Italy’s ranking in cross-country surveys of the business environment is poor
(and worsening). Significant labor market rigidities (notwithstanding important progress)
also inhibit growth by slowing labor reallocation. There was agreement that reforms to
promote competition and eliminate bureaucratic impediments are thus essential to foster
innovation and restore competitiveness. Indeed, these arguments feature prominently in the
government’s medium-term program, which presents a compelling illustration of the benefits
of greater competition for households’ budgets and firms’ costs (though it is short on details).
In labor markets, however, staff and the authorities differed on the appropriate prescriptions
on how best to address concerns about “precarious” employment.
25.
After a promising start, the liberalization process has encountered stiff
resistance from interest groups. In July 2006, the government approved a package of
measures that liberalized aspects of transportation, professional services, retail trade, and
banking and insurance services. Some of the reforms subsequently fell hostage to sectoral
opposition, with, for example, protests by taxi drivers leading to maintenance of a key
restriction to market access; supermarkets and other nonpharmacy outlets encountering
supply difficulties for over-the-counter drugs they are now authorized to sell; and banks
seeking means to hinder the effective portability of accounts and by-pass the disposition
allowing their free closure. The Antitrust Authority has been proactive in attempting to
ensure that such resistance would not dilute the reforms’ impact, promptly initiating
enquiries into possible anticompetitive behavior, and has availed itself of new powers,
including those over competition in the banking sector (previously vested in the Bank of

Such changes would be in line with the recommendations of the 2002 ROSC.

Italy). It also expected the newly introduced “leniency policy” (whereby companies that
provide information about a cartel in which they participate could receive immunity from
fines) to be a potent instrument—as has been the case in other countries (including the
United States).
26.
The government has vowed to persevere with deregulation and liberalization,
and a number of draft laws are in the works—but they too face opposition. The main
initiatives concern energy, local public services, class action suits, and professional services.
Several of these proposals face opposition—including from within the coalition—and thus an
uncertain fate in Parliament. Resistance is particularly strong vis-à-vis initiatives that would
open up local utilities to a competitive bidding process (the current practice of direct
assignments to municipal companies being a long-standing font of patronage, in addition to a
source of inefficiency); the easing of access to the professions; and the introduction of class
action lawsuits, where fear of abuses may considerably enfeeble the scope for consumer
redress. As to reform sequencing, there was agreement—based also on the July 2006
experience—that a bold stroke, simultaneously affecting economic rents across several
markets, could help promote consensus and balance the interests of opposing stakeholders.
Staff accordingly encouraged ambitious, broad, and early liberalizing moves. At the same
time, given the dispersion of ministerial responsibilities, it saw a need for a strategic view
and enhanced coordination in the pursuit of the liberalization agenda.
27.
The government’s preoccupation with reducing the precariousness of
employment threatens the recent liberalization of labor contracts. The liberalization of
labor contracts in 2002–03 coincided with sharp employment growth, with the growth of
“liberalized” employment outpacing that of “traditional” employment. Despite this, the level
of temporary contracts in Italy is still comparatively low. There is nonetheless strong
pressure (from trade unions and from within the coalition) to take steps to make employment
more “stable” and reduce its precariousness. Proposals are still being developed, but are
likely to include the suppression of some atypical contracts, limitations on the use and
renewal of fixed-term contracts, and other steps to reverse the cost advantages of fixed-term
contracts. In contrast, staff reiterated the need to further reduce the still high protection
afforded to regular contracts, alongside introducing a well designed unemployment benefit
scheme—whose absence underlies concerns about precariousness and inhibits risk-taking
and mobility. It noted that simulations in other European countries suggest that, absent
reforms affecting the rigidity of regular contracts, the initial employment spurt from
liberalizing contracts will eventually fade. While instituting an adequate unemployment
safety net is part of the official policy agenda, the authorities firmly ruled out easing
dismissal protection, as contrary to the coalition’s electoral platform.9

At the same time, in policy circles, the Danish “flexicurity” model—far removed from the Italian reality—
tends to exercise a somewhat facile appeal. For the difficulties of generalizing this model, see Zhou, Jianping,
“Danish for all? Balancing Flexibility with Security: The Flexicurity Model,” IMF Country Report No. 06/342.

25
Further developing the financial system
28.
The new leadership of the Bank of Italy has supported banking sector
consolidation, with tangible results. Shortly after taking office, the new Governor criticized
the Italian banking system’s “strategic inertia” and made the case for a sustained, marketdriven, consolidation effort. In this vein, the Bank of Italy abolished the requirement to notify
the supervisory authorities of merger plans even before they are submitted to the board of
directors. There has been appreciable movement over the past year: some sizable mergers are
underway, including one that would create Europe’s third largest bank and, notably, crossborder mergers have also taken place or are being discussed.10 This process should enhance
efficiency in the banking system—where the costs of banking services for customers are still
high—and promote growth. The process is also testing the new joint oversight of merger
activity by the Bank of Italy and the Antitrust Authority: while there remain some transition
issues to resolve, both parties felt that matters were proceeding relatively smoothly. For its
part, the Bank of Italy has announced a plan to reorganize its structure and staffing levels
over time.
29.
There was agreement that, to support growth and innovation, Italy’s financial
system needs to further develop its capital markets (Box 5).11 The stock, insurance, and
corporate bond markets are developing rapidly, but remain undersized. A range of key
indicators are below the euro-area average, some considerably: the number of listed
companies and the ratio of their total capitalization to GDP; the proportion of private equity
investment dedicated to venture capital operations and, even more so, to start-ups; the
capacity of small firms with innovative projects to raise funds on the capital markets; and the
role of specialized intermediaries and pension funds. The situation is attributable to a range
of impediments: bankruptcy and debt recovery procedures remain lengthy; the enforcement
of corporate governance provisions has shortcomings; and a history of high tax evasion may
compound these problems, as family-owned firms may believe they can more easily avoid
the scrutiny of the fiscal authorities if they do not open themselves to outside capital. Against
this, the authorities saw potential in their plans for a supplementary pension pillar. Staff
concurred, but stressed that—given the complexity of the mechanism for the allocation of
workers’ severance payment flows—there was a need for a clear educational campaign to
allow informed choices. Free and fair competition between classes of asset managers and
types of retirement schemes would also be important.

10

With consolidation also involving cooperative banks, the Bank of Italy has called for adapting the corporative
governance rules of such banks and, in early December, the government announced its intention to revise their
voting structure.

A Selected Issues Paper explores links between the financial system and growth.

26

Box 5. Finance and Growth in Italy
International experience suggests Italy’s growth prospects would benefit from further diversifying
and deepening its financial system. Not only is financial development in general associated with higher
growth, there is also some macro evidence suggesting that industrial countries with financial systems
dominated by a particular type of intermediation, especially relationship lending, are less able to seize
growth opportunities.1 The effect is particularly pronounced in countries that have specialized in more
traditional industries, such as Italy.
Analysis of Italian micro data supports the tenet that availability of alternative sources of
financing is associated with higher productivity and growth. The results, set out in a Selected Issues
Paper, hold even when controlling for firm-specific financing decisions and industry-specific effects. In
particular:
•

Debt financing has a positive marginal effect on firms’ future investment, innovation, and
revenues. In particular, bond leverage is especially important in high-growth and tech-intensive
sectors. And bond debt may mitigate the (generally negative) effect of concentrated ownership.

•

Diversification of bank lenders improves a firm’s future growth.

•

Public equity financing is strongly correlated with high growth and innovation. And firms that
decide to list are more likely to operate in high-growth sectors, with high capital requirements
and leverage.

Policies that could promote alternative financing sources include measures to: promote bank
competition; reduce listing costs; enhance the effectiveness of corporate governance, accounting, and
disclosure requirements; further enhance minority shareholder protection; discipline insider dealing
reduce the overall administrative burden of doing business; and increase investor and creditor protection.
EU-wide initiatives such as Financial Services Action Plan aimed at eliminating the remaining
fragmentation in capital markets, offer a useful legal framework. Development of a private pension pillar
and further public divestment could also help. While there has been progress across several of these areas
in Italy, it remains uneven and insufficient.

Economic Outlook, October 2006.

D. Maintaining Financial Stability
30.
The 2005 FSSA found that Italy’s financial system was in good health from a
stability standpoint, and subsequent developments have been favorable. In an
environment of cyclical strength and only modestly higher interest rates, financial soundness
indicators have tended to improve, some rapidly: bank net profits rose by 9.2 percent in 2005,
and the nonperforming loan ratio, though still higher than elsewhere in Europe, fell
markedly. Capital adequacy ratios have declined marginally, but remain well above the
legally required minimum.

27
31.
Important regulatory reforms are progressing. A revised Bank of Italy Statute,
which, inter alia, establishes fixed terms for all members of the Bank’s Directorate and
enhances the transparency and collegiality of its decisions, was adopted at endNovember 2006. A Code of Ethics was also introduced earlier in the year. Decisions
regarding changes to the Bank of Italy’s ownership (currently majority-owned by private
sector banks) need to be implemented by the government within three years, according to the
2005 Savings law, with the Bank stressing the importance that its independence be fully
safeguarded in the process. Progress has also been made on other FSSA recommendations,
notably on rules governing the classification of impaired loans (gradually moving to the
standard 90-day past due criterion) and regulation of lending to related parties.
32.
Where possible, the Bank of Italy favors replacing detailed rules with
supervisory principles and self-regulatory mechanisms. It views such a shift as allowing
market forces to better express themselves, especially in a setting where constant financial
innovation can result in the rapid obsolescence of formally rigorous rules. At the same time,
it acknowledges that such an approach increases the responsibility of the supervisory
authority, requiring it to be fully transparent in accounting for its actions. In this vein, staff
suggested issuing regular forward-looking Financial Stability Reports—these could also
contribute to much-needed financial education. The Bank was reviewing this possibility, with
an eye also on evolving practices elsewhere (including at the Bank of England and the FSA
for the United Kingdom) and on avoiding overlap with other analogous reports (e.g., by the
ECB).
E. Other Issues
33.
Italy’s statistics are broadly adequate for surveillance. The recent ROSC update
reported some improvements, notably on reconciling the discrepancy between the fiscal
deficit and the borrowing requirement. Further progress is however needed in the context of
developing an integrated presentation of government finance statistics.
34.
Italy’s ODA almost doubled in 2005 to 0.29 percent of GNI, but remains well
short of the targeted benchmark. Due to stringent budgetary conditions, ODA is expected
to decline in 2006–07, to 0.21 and 0.19 percent of GNI respectively (excluding planned
participation in new financing mechanisms such as the International Finance Facility for
Immunization).
III. STAFF APPRAISAL
35.
While a start has been made, the current economic recovery and the beginning
of a new government’s term provide an opportunity for adjustment and reform that
Italy can ill afford to miss. Growth is picking up, some progress has been achieved on the
structural reform agenda, and buoyant revenues are helping the fiscal outturn. International
experience suggests that reforms are best undertaken early in a legislature's mandate. All in
all, the current economic environment is likely to prove “as good as it gets” for fully

28
implementing the authorities’ ambitious medium-term economic plan needed to unshackle
Italy’s growth potential.
36.
Remarkably strong revenues pushed the 2006 deficit below its original target,
but record spending highlights fundamental problems. The strong revenue
performance—at least partly structural—could strengthen the fiscal accounts in the medium
term, but only if spending pressures are contained. The ratio of primary current spending to
GDP is at its highest level in at least a quarter century. Rebuilding the primary surplus and
driving down debt will require addressing the factors that account for this persistent rise in
spending.
37.
The 2007 budget seems well set to secure a key objective—reducing the deficit to
below 3 percent of GDP—but relies entirely on higher revenues. The trend of rising
primary current expenditure would be arrested (but only just) as envisaged savings will be
offset by new expenditure initiatives. The budget contains some initial measures that could,
over time, contribute to containing expenditure pressures. But they fall short of addressing
comprehensively the structural determinants of such pressures. At the same time, scope for
additional spending is created by the transfer of severance fund contributions to the public
sector—an accounting measure that does not constitute underlying adjustment. Italy’s reentry
within the Maastricht deficit limit—itself an important milestone—could thus prove shortlived, with the higher revenue-to-GDP ratio simply fueling the country’s relentless public
spending machine.
38.
Although a greater emphasis on overall expenditure control in the 2007 budget
would have been warranted, some revenue measures are well-founded. Among these,
curbing evasion would help improve equity and eliminate distortions that reduce Italy’s
growth potential. The commitment to abandon tax amnesties should also encourage better tax
compliance, provided it is fully adhered to. The resultant widening of the tax base would,
along with durable progress in reducing spending, create scope for further tax reductions,
building on the cut in the tax wedge planned for 2007, while safeguarding underlying
adjustment.
39.
Structural reforms in priority spending areas should be initiated now so as to
make them effective before the next budget round. Planned discussions on civil service
reform should begin promptly, with a view to reducing the relatively high wage bill and
enhancing efficiency, including by increasing mobility, essential for the planned territorial
reorganization. Domestic Stability Pact revisions that shift from spending to deficit limits are
a step forward, but Italy is still far from a fiscally responsible system of federalism. The
agreed health pact should be rigorously implemented. A series of pension reforms adopted
over the years will—if implemented faithfully—significantly reduce the fiscal costs
associated with an aging population. To this end, it is essential that the pension agreement
sought by March 2007 fully preserve the financial impact of already legislated reforms.

29
Finally, several state enterprises need restructuring to put them on a sounder financial
footing, reducing another drain on public resources.
40.
The growing interest in reforming budget procedures is well-placed. Current
budget procedures concentrate on legal requirements and financial inputs, but not results; a
shift to a program orientation can generate greater efficiency and accountability, both
lacking. While reforming budgetary procedures can take years, introducing pilot projects
along these lines can help initiate the process. A multiyear spending framework with clear
targets for outer years would also facilitate planning. An explicit commitment to use revenue
overperformance solely for deficit reduction would also be useful, as would greater
institutional independence of budget assessments and projections.
41.
Excessive regulation and protection continue to hamper growth: accelerating
competition-enhancing reforms should be a high priority. Protection results in high prices
for consumers and reduced competitiveness: a tax imposed on the majority for the benefit of
the few. Measures to promote competition are critical to generate a more dynamic, efficient,
and fundamentally fair economy. The liberalizing decrees introduced in the summer of 2006
provided an important initial signal, which should now be followed by appropriately
ambitious liberalizing initiatives in the various areas under consideration. Moving forward,
the liberalization agenda will need to be pursued within a well-coordinated strategy and with
explicit timeframes. Proceeding on a broad front, addressing rigidities in a variety of areas
simultaneously, can help promote consensus and a balance across the interests of different
stakeholders.
42.
Reforms to labor contracting have been critical to employment growth, and need
to be safeguarded and extended. Notable improvements in Italy’s labor market have been
made in recent years, resulting in strong employment growth. While fixed-term contracts
have been an important path to traditional, open-ended employment for many, concerns have
been raised about the precariousness of employment under these schemes. Rather than scale
back these reforms—and with them much of the employment gains of recent years—the
response should be to develop an adequate safety net, offering better, and appropriately
conditional, unemployment support in tandem with further paring employment protection, for
Italy to be able to compete in the global economy.
43.
Over time, pension reform can also contribute to growth. Population aging stands
to have a dramatic effect on Italy’s growth potential, particularly as participation rates for
older individuals remain very low. Reforms that provide incentives to lengthen the average
working life, by establishing a closer link between pension contributions and benefits and
eliminating rules that bar retirees from working while receiving pensions, would enhance
growth potential and allow a higher standard of living for the elderly.
44.
To fully play its role in promoting growth, the financial sector needs to move
beyond its heavy reliance on bank intermediation. Nonbank funding sources, in particular

30
venture capital, are important for financing new firms. Here, action across a broad front to
remove impediments is needed, including measures to improve the enforcement of the legal
framework.
45.
Recent developments in the banking sector have been positive. Financial
soundness indicators have generally improved, and credit growth has remained robust. There
has been significant progress in implementing the recommendations of the 2005 FSSA: in
particular, responsibility for regulating anticompetitive behavior has been transferred to the
Antitrust Authority, and the Bank of Italy’s Statute has been modified to increase
transparency and accountability.
46.
The Bank of Italy’s openly encouraging attitude toward bank consolidation is
promoting efficiency-enhancing changes. Signs of greater contestability in the system,
including by cross-border players, are encouraging. Greater transparency in banks’
interactions with clients will also lead to increased competition in the sector, and the
Antitrust Authority’s commitment to monitor this carefully is welcome.
47.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12-month
cycle.

Appendix II. Italy: Statistical Information
The economic database is comprehensive, generally of high quality, and adequate for
surveillance purposes. The authorities regularly publish a full range of economic and
financial data. Italy has subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) and
has posted the metadata on the Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB), meeting
nearly all specifications for coverage, periodicity, timeliness for published data, and the
dissemination of advance release calendars. Italy is also subject to the statistical requirements
and timeliness and reporting standards of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB),
and has adopted the European System of Accounts 1995 (ESA95). The shift to chainweighted indices for national accounts has been largely completed over the course of 2006.
Under the Coordinated Compilation Exercise for Financial Soundness Indicators (FSIs)
conducted by the Fund, the authorities recently produced a set of indicators broadly
consistent with the Fund's FSI Compilation Guide.
The 2002 Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC)—Data Module
(Country Report No. 02/234, 10/18/02) found Italy’s macroeconomic statistics to be of
generally high quality, but also identified some shortcomings: (i) no statistical agency had
the responsibility to compile and disseminate a comprehensive statement of government
finances, and a persistent difference had emerged between the SGP-monitored fiscal deficit
and the PSBR net of privatization receipts; (ii) source data and/or statistical techniques could
be strengthened in several areas, most importantly, by raising response rates on the enterprise
surveys used in the national accounts and PPI, making price collection for the CPI more
efficient, and improving the coverage of cross-border financial transactions; (iii) balance of
payments and government finance statistics should be more closely aligned with the
internationally accepted methodological guidelines on concepts and definitions, scope,
classification and sectorization, and/or valuation; and (iv) resources were under pressure in
some parts of the National Institute of Statistics (Istat) in the face of the statistical
requirements of the European Union and the Euro area.
Many of these shortcomings have been addressed since then, as found by a 2006 ROSC data
module update mission (covering the national accounts, CPI and PPI, and government
finance statistics (GFS)): (i) Istat has become responsible for disseminating general
government statistics; (ii) the benchmark revision of the national accounts was implemented
in 2005, updating the benchmark to 2000, revising the calculation and allocation of financial
services indirectly measured, introducing chained volume and price measures, and improving
many compilation methods; (iii) work is well advanced on implementing random sampling
techniques for the CPI collection and the price collection period has been adjusted so it is
fully in the reference month; and (iv) the consistency of the constituent parts of the GFS was
enhanced through better interagency coordination. Additional improvements include: the
publication of quarterly data for the general government balance, expenditure, and revenue
on an accruals basis (in line with ESA95); a more detailed labor force survey; and progress in

5
reconciling the discrepancy between the cash-based net borrowing requirement and the
accrual budget deficit.
Nevertheless, weaknesses remain in some areas. In the quarterly national accounts, changes
in inventories are derived residually, along with the statistical discrepancy, thus hampering
the business cycle analysis. In PPI, weaknesses remained in the weighting data sources, and
there is scope to improve some of the statistical techniques used in the index compilation.
The validation process at Istat is constrained by important time lags in assessing the
economic nature of transactions and practices that limit revisions to the published aggregates.
This may lead to inconsistencies with the GFS component that is under the responsibility of
the Bank of Italy. In addition, as highlighted by the fiscal transparency ROSC and the two
follow-ups, the quality and timeliness of some fiscal data, particularly on expenditure by
local governments, is still in need of improvement.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2006 Article IV Consultation with Italy
On February 7, 2007, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Italy.1
Background
The economy is enjoying a broad-based, if comparatively modest, cyclical upswing. Output is
estimated to have grown by 1¾ percent in 2006—the strongest pace since the beginning of the
decade. Inflation is close to that of the euro area, financial conditions are favorable,
unemployment is falling, and the current account deficit is moderate. However, growth—
constrained by sluggish potential—is projected to ease to around 1½ percent this year. And
despite recovering exports and some initial signs of economic restructuring, medium-term
productivity and competitiveness trends remain of concern.
Unexpectedly strong revenues contributed to a better underlying fiscal outturn last year. Net of
two large one-off operations, the deficit is estimated to have been well below the original target
of 3½ percent of GDP, despite recurrent spending overruns. The 2007 budget will likely achieve
the objective of bringing the headline deficit under the key 3 percent of GDP threshold. The
public debt ratio, after rising in 2005–06, should broadly stabilize at around 107 percent. The
2007 budget included several structural spending containment initiatives, but some of their key
aspects have yet to be finalized.
Some progress has been made on broad-based structural reform. Deregulation of selected
services got an initial impetus from a decree adopted last July, and a follow-up liberalization

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

package has been approved. However, recent initiatives in labor contracting envision a partial
roll-back of earlier liberalizing reforms. Banking sector consolidation and competition have been
tangibly boosted, and various reforms to enhance financial sector transparency have
progressed. Still, Italy’s product and labor markets remain rigid and nonbank financial
intermediation is relatively undersized.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed Italy’s economic upturn, noting its broad-based nature, continued
employment gains, stable inflation rate, and signs of economic restructuring. At the same time,
buoyant revenues are helping the fiscal outturn and progress has been achieved on the
structural reform agenda. Directors welcomed the authorities’ ambitious medium-term economic
plan, and underscored that the opportunity offered by the cyclical upswing and the early phase
of the new government’s mandate not be missed. New progress in boosting productivity and
increasing competition in product and services markets will be needed to sustain good growth
performance.
Directors were encouraged by the better-than-anticipated 2006 fiscal outturn, excluding one-off
measures. They noted that this mostly reflected stronger revenue buoyancy, a good part of
which appears structural. However, primary spending is estimated to have appreciably
exceeded the original budget targets, indicating continued expenditure control problems.
Directors considered that the 2007 budget would secure the important milestone of bringing the
deficit below 3 percent of GDP. Directors viewed many of the budget’s revenue measures as
well-founded, especially those combating evasion and widening the tax base. At the same time,
while acknowledging some initial expenditure control measures, Directors noted that the
planned 2007 adjustment relies heavily on revenues. They accordingly called for rapid progress
in structural spending reforms in the key areas of public employment, local government
finances, and health care. Safeguarding the financial impact of the already-legislated pension
reforms would also be essential. In addition, several state enterprises need restructuring to
reduce their drain on public resources. Directors stressed that stronger efforts to control
spending in all these areas would be key to rebuilding the primary surplus, driving down debt,
and ensuring the durability of Italy’s re-entry under the 3 percent of GDP deficit threshold.
Given Italy’s aging population and high public debt, Directors cautioned that fiscal consolidation
would need to be pursued considerably further for longer-term sustainability to be achieved. To
buttress the authorities’ medium-term objective of a small overall surplus, Directors encouraged
prompt adoption of a multi-year spending framework with clear targets for outer years, backed
by explicit expenditure-saving and efficiency-oriented measures. An overhaul of cumbersome
budget procedures—including strengthening budgetary governance and introducing an explicit
rule assigning revenue overperformance to deficit reduction—would also be helpful. Directors
noted that the resulting durable improvements in expenditure control would in due course create
scope for tax reduction, while safeguarding fiscal adjustment.

3
Directors underscored that vigorous pursuit of structural reforms aimed at reducing regulation,
increasing competition, and improving the business environment is necessary to raise
productivity and growth. In this context, they welcomed recent and planned product market
liberalization and competition-enhancing initiatives, and called for accelerated progress across a
broad front to garner wide public support, emphasizing the benefits of a well-coordinated
strategy and explicit timeframes. While cautioning against any reversal of prior liberalizations of
labor contracting, which contributed to buoyant employment growth this past decade, Directors
recommended the development of an adequate safety net, with improved unemployment
support, to mitigate the effects of the needed greater employment flexibility. They also noted
that pension reform, by providing incentives to lengthen the average working life, could support
economic growth and welfare.
Directors noted that the financial system remains sound and well supervised, and welcomed
recent actions to enhance competition and transparency in financial markets. In particular, the
greater contestability observed in the banking sector, reflected in the ongoing consolidation,
stands to improve efficiency and the quality of services. Directors also welcomed the significant
progress in implementing the recommendations of the 2005 Financial System Stability
Assessment. At the same time, Directors underscored that to fully play its role in promoting
growth, the financial sector needs to complement its reliance on bank intermediation with a
greater role for capital markets. This entails action across a broad front, including measures to
improve enforcement of the legal framework.
Directors encouraged the authorities to increase their official development assistance toward
the UN target of 0.7 percent of gross national income.

Statement by Arrigo Sadun, Executive Director for Italy
February 7, 2007

1. Overview
We wish to thank the staff for engaging in a frank and constructive dialogue with the
authorities and for the insightful set of papers on crucial aspects of the Italian economy.
In our opinion recent improvements in economic performance reflect—to a large extent—
structural changes initiated long ago. The economic strategy of the new government entails a
number of priorities. The primary objective has been the consolidation of fiscal accounts,
pursued first with the supplementary budget adopted in the middle of last year and, more
recently, with the approval of a very stringent budget for 2007. Both the EU Commission and
the Fund agree that these measures are adequate to meet the 2005 EU Council
recommendations.1
Implementation of the reform agenda is another key priority of economic policy. After the
liberalizations enacted last summer, the government has just introduced a second package of
sweeping measures to liberalize the product and service markets. Further initiatives are
expected shortly concerning the liberalization of the energy sector and local utilities.
Equally important changes have taken place in the financial and banking sectors, including
measures to enhance investors’ protection, to improve corporate governance, and to
strengthen cooperation among financial regulators.
Despite recent improvements, the Italian economy is still facing substantial challenges; fiscal
accounts must be consolidated further, regional disparities reduced, the efficiency of public
administration enhanced, and productivity and potential growth increased. The authorities are
committed to achieving these goals and to supporting the transformations that are reshaping
the economy.
2. Economic Outlook
After stagnating in 2005, the GDP rebounded sharply in 2006 thanks to the recovery in
domestic demand. The main drivers of the upturn have been private consumption, fueled by
rising disposable income and improved confidence, and investment in machinery and
1

The 2005 EU Council recommendation calls for a) bringing the deficit to below 3 percent, b) reducing the
cyclically-adjusted balance by at least 1.6 percentage points of GDP over two years, and c) restoring an
adequate level of primary surplus in the medium term to ensure that the debt ratio declines at a satisfactory
pace.

equipment. The contribution of the foreign sector has been limited, as the significant increase
in exports was offset by higher imports, particularly in the energy sector. The authorities’
growth projections for 2006 and 2007, at 1.6 and 1.3 percent respectively, are broadly in line
with those of the Fund. In the period 2008-11, economic growth is expected to accelerate
steadily to 1.7 percent.
Strong job creation has been one of the brightest spots of the Italian economy for a number of
years. In 2006 employment growth accelerated to 1 percent, bringing the unemployment rate
to 6.9 percent, well below the EU average. Despite substantially higher oil prices, inflation
has remained under control and in line with the euro-area average. Inflation is expected to
ease from last year’s 2.2 percent to 2.1 in 2007 and to 1.7 in 2008. The liberalization
measures recently adopted will contribute to contain inflationary pressure. Overall, the
economic outlook remains favorable, although a slight slowdown is expected this year in line
with a similar trend anticipated in other EU countries.
3. Competitiveness
We agree with staff that boosting productivity and promoting wage moderation are critical
steps to restore Italy's competitiveness and raise its growth potential. Staff points to the loss
of constant-price market shares as symptomatic of the deterioration of the country’s
competitiveness. Staff analysis suggests that the competitiveness gap between Italy and its
major euro-area partners is “appreciable, albeit not large” as estimates range between 5 and 8
percent. In addition, staff argues that Italian firms choose to pass higher production costs
onto prices, even at the risk of losing market shares. However, this interpretation understates
the major transformation process initiated by Italian industry in the past few years. We note
that, measured at current prices, Italy’s market shares have remained fairly stable; this
suggests that, facing relentless competition, firms have managed to move their production up
the value-added ladder, commanding premium prices. The strategy to regain competitiveness
in sectors in which the country has a traditional competitive advantage seems to be working.
Export performance has improved lately. In 2006 exports increased by a projected 5 percent
in real terms—the biggest increase in several years. The recovery was broadly based and also
affected some of the country's most traditional sectors.
4. Fiscal Policy
As mentioned above, the first priority of the new government has been to meet the 2005 EU
Council Recommendations and to achieve a structurally balanced budget by 2010. The Fund
and the EU Commission acknowledge that Italy is well positioned to reach the goal of
reducing the deficit-to-GDP ratio to below 3 percent in 2007. According to preliminary
estimates it appears that the central government deficit, net of one-offs, may have already
declined below the Maastricht threshold last year.

3
The 2007 Budget: revenue increases and expenditure cuts
The 2007 Budget entails an overall package of about 2.3 percent of the GDP, of which 1.3
percentage points are growth-enhancing measures and 1 percentage point structural
budgetary adjustments. The cyclically-adjusted balance, net of one-offs, will be reduced by
almost 1.5 percentage points.
While we concur with staff that the 2007 budgetary adjustment relies heavily on the revenue
side, their statement that the adjustment stems “entirely from an increase of the revenue
ratio” needs some clarification.2 The revenue increase stems mostly from greater tax
compliance and the broadening of the tax base rather than rate hikes. As the authorities are
committed to reducing tax evasion and elusion, there is no reason to expect the current
revenue surge to be just a temporary phenomenon. Although the top tax brackets have been
increased marginally and the rates have been harmonized across various financial
instruments in line with the EU standards, the 2007 Budget has also raised tax allowances
and subsidies for low-income households. Furthermore, the budget provides for a significant
reduction, estimated at about 5 percentage points, in the labor-tax wedge.
Notwithstanding the focus on the revenue side, the 2007 Budget includes structural cuts in
current expenditures of about 0.5 percent of GDP. Savings will increase in the coming years
as current expenditures will decline by 0.7 percent of GDP both in 2007 and 2008. These
structural savings will be achieved through the downsizing and consolidation of several
government agencies. A recent agreement between the Central Government and the Regions
aims at containing public health expenditures, the major source of overruns in the local
government budgets. Incentives will be provided to those administrations that meet the
budgetary guidelines, while co-payments have been slightly increased. The strict sanctioning
mechanism introduced last year to curb over-spending has been retained.
The domestic stability pact,3 which excludes healthcare costs, has been further strengthened
by setting fiscal targets for the whole budget rather than for individual expenditure
categories.
The Second Pillar Pension Scheme
In line with staff recommendations, the government has taken major steps to foster the
development of private pension funds. This is critical to boost the entitlements of future
generations, for whom the defined contribution system will have its full impact. Future
payments to employees' severance accounts will be channeled either into private pension
funds or into a State Fund, according to the beneficiary’s choice. It is estimated that the State
Fund will receive resources amounting to 0.4 percent of GDP in 2007 and to 0.3 percent in
the following years. These resources will be used to finance public projects necessary to
upgrade the country’s infrastructure and enhance growth.

4
Debt and sustainability
The government is committed to restoring a substantial primary surplus to ensure a
satisfactory pace of debt reduction. The objective is to increase the primary surplus steadily
until it reaches 5 percent of GDP in 2011. In 2007 the debt-to-GDP ratio will start to fall
again and the pace of reduction will accelerate from 2008 onward; according to the
December 2006 Stability Program, the debt-to-GDP ratio will dip to below 100 percent in
2010 and to below 60 percent in 2020.
Although Italy has the highest ratio of pension expenditures to GDP among the EU countries,
the ratio is expected to increase only marginally from now through 2050, provided that the
provisions of previous reforms are implemented. The EU Commission stress tests, using a
sustainability gap and required primary balance,4 indicate that meeting the fiscal targets
included in the Stability Program (December 2006 update)5 will ensure long-run
sustainability.
5. Structural Reforms
Enhancing Competition
The recent packages of liberalization include an array of measures to increase competition in
the service and product sectors, including telecommunications, transportation, insurance,
gasoline distribution networks, and the wholesale natural gas market. Furthermore, steps
have been taken to streamline the public administration and remove excessive burdens on
business, including much simplified procedures to start new businesses. Additional measures
are expected shortly concerning the liberalization of the energy markets and local public
utilities. By liberalizing several sectors simultaneously, the government aims to create
synergies between the various measures and balance the interests of different stakeholders,
thus maximizing public support.
Labor market
Despite several years of slow economic growth, Italy is one of the few EU countries to have
enjoyed a robust rate of job creation and a substantial fall in unemployment over the last
decade. These results stem from the reforms implemented in the past several years that have
increased the flexibility of the labor market and fostered the participation of women.
The new measures planned by the government do not intend to reduce the use of flexible
forms of employment, but rather to increase safeguards for non-traditional workers and
provide incentives to transform temporary employment into permanent labor contracts. In
other words, the authorities' strategy aims to rely on flexible contracts to help workers break
into the labor market, and to promote the move to more stable forms of employment. The

5
authorities concur with staff on the need to develop a well-balanced and strong social safety
net, as a pre-condition to further reducing labor rigidities.
6. Banking sector developments and financial regulation
Banking sector
In the last ten years the Italian banking system has undergone a process of intense
consolidation, involving approximately 450 banks representing 80 percent of total assets.
Several indicators show that the banking system is competitive. Assets held by foreign banks
represent 17 percent of the total, a percentage that is higher than in other major European
countries. The cost-income ratio is 1 percentage point below the average of the EU area;
ROA is in line with the EU average, while ROE is slightly below. There is however room for
further improvements, particularly in the area of consumer credit and asset management.
Recent initiatives of the Italian Banks’ Association (ABI) facilitate price comparability and
free portability of current accounts.
Financial stability
For the first half of 2006, all prudential indicators were favorable: both the stock of NPLs
and the flows of new NPLs are historically low, while the capital adequacy ratio increased
marginally. The system is well positioned to introduce Basel II; the new capital requirements
directive was formally implemented in December 2006. The implementation of the Saving
Law (2005) improved corporate governance and increased transparency, consumer
protection, and coordination among regulators. Consob’s resources and sanction power have
been increased.
The review of the Bank of Italy’s statute, promoted by the Saving Law, has been recently
approved. The government is discussing a bill that would allow for the ownership revision of
the Bank of Italy to take place within one year, instead of in three years as the Law indicates.
However, it must be stressed than even under the current arrangements, there are no conflicts
of interest between the supervised entities and the supervisor, due to the presence of several
specific legal safeguards. The purpose of the reform is also to preserve the independency of
the Bank of Italy, as well as to reduce the number of financial regulators, consolidating the
functions of UIC, Isvap, and Covip in the Bank of Italy and Consob.
7. Corporate governance and development of an arm’s-length financial market
In Italy, corporate governance is characterized by the role of shareholders’ coalitions and
ownership concentration. Family-based firms—even large ones—are reluctant to go public,
fearing that they may lose control of the business. Moreover, only a few companies are rated,
which reduces the possibility of gaining access to international corporate bond markets. So
far, the ability to access the capital market, including for foreign investors, has been
mitigated by the relatively easy access to other forms of financing. One of the main

6
drawbacks of the above-mentioned corporate structure is a lower firm contestability and
greater management insulation from outside pressure. The start-up of a private pension pillar
will have relevant positive implications both on institutional investors and the development
of the capital market.
In the area of corporate governance, we believe that the regulatory framework is among the
most advanced and incorporates the best international practices. For instance, minority
shareholders are among the most protected when compared to other industrial countries; the
current regulation for takeovers is more stringent than the EU directive; norms on insider
trading have been implemented at the most rigorous level of EU guidelines; accounting
standards and disclosure are in line with European standards. The recent Bankruptcy Law
increased the chances of recovery and rapid restructuring for firms in temporary difficulty
and streamlined the procedures for liquidation. Lastly, Italian listing rules and costs are in
line with peer European stock exchanges.
There is always room for improvement, but at this stage, we believe that only relatively
minor refinements are necessary. In our view the main problems are not in the regulatory
framework, but rather in its implementation, due to inefficiencies in the judiciary and
administrative systems. The authorities are strongly committed to overcoming these
shortcomings.
8. Other Issues
In 2005 the Italian ODA was equal to 0.29 percent of GNI, doubling the 2004 results. While
on the basis of current estimates, Italian ODA is expected to decrease in 2006, Italy continues
to adhere to the EU commitment to reach an ODA-to-GNI ratio of 0.51 percent (as an
individual target) by 2010. The related budget appropriations will gradually increase, taking
into account the constraints due to the ongoing budgetary consolidation. The government has
planned to carry out a full-fledged reform aimed at boosting the Italian development
cooperation.
