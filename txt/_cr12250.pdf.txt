STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
June 1, 2012

KEY ISSUES
Samoa’s economic growth has been slow and volatile over the past five years as a
result of a series of shocks. Over the medium term, growth is projected to rise to
around 2½ percent, a rate still significantly lower than what Samoa achieved in the
decade before the current slowdown. This outlook is also subject to considerable
downside risks in the current global, regional and domestic environment.
A key challenge is to reduce the fiscal deficit to bring public debt to a more
sustainable level while supporting economic recovery. Meeting this challenge will
require reprioritization of development expenditure and restraint on recurrent
expenditure, including government wages and salaries. It is important that a mediumterm consolidation path is spelled out and that borrowing decisions are made
consistent with this path. Moreover, debt incurred by public enterprises needs to be
closely monitored to ensure that contingent liabilities are manageable.
An appropriate mix of exchange rate and monetary policies is essential to
maintain internal and external balances. Given the substantial real appreciation of
the tala over the past decade, it is critical to monitor changes in Samoa’s
competitiveness and realign the exchange rate as necessary. Monetary policy, while
appropriate to support recovery at the moment, should stand ready for tightening if
and when the exchange rate begins to adjust.
Continued structural reforms are essential to restore Samoa’s strong growth
record. Much progress has been made, but considerable challenges remain. Priority
should be given to reforming public enterprises, tapping the productive potential of
customary land, strengthening financial supervision and intermediation, and further
improving public financial management.

SAMOA 2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

CONTEXT
1.

Samoa is heavily dependent on tourism, remittances, and aid. It has a strong track

record on macroeconomic management and until recently its economy had been growing more
rapidly than most other Pacific island countries. The last Article IV consultation with Samoa was held
in March 2010, following a delay in the aftermath of a devastating tsunami hitting the country in
September 2009. A request for disbursement under the Rapid-Access Component of the Exogenous
Shocks Facility was approved in December 2009. With the help of development partners, posttsunami reconstruction is now almost complete. A general election was held in March 2011 and the
incumbent government was returned to power.
2.

After a moderate recovery in 2010/11, the economy has shown signs of slowing down

amid rising and volatile inflation caused by weather conditions. Fiscal deficits and public debt
have increased sharply in the wake of the global financial crisis and post-tsunami reconstruction,
while the current account deficit has widened with the real appreciation of the tala. Foreign reserves
have fallen significantly over the past year, but remain adequate. Banks are well capitalized and
mostly profitable, but non-performing loans (NPLs) are rising for some banks amid weak economic
activity, especially in the tourism industry.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
3.

After two consecutive years of contraction, real GDP expanded by 2.0 percent in

2010/11 (July/June), on account of fiscal
and monetary stimulus as well as swift
post-tsunami reconstruction. However,
growth slowed considerably in the last
quarter of 2011, to 0.8 percent (year-onyear), and is expected to remain subdued
until the second quarter of 2012, when the
celebration of the 50th anniversary of
Samoa’s independence will attract more
tourists and boost economic activity.
Growth is likely to be around 1½ percent

for FY2012 as a whole and to pick up pace only modestly in FY2013, as reconstruction activity
continues to subside and the growth of external demand remains moderate. Over the medium term,
growth is projected to rise to around 2½ percent. However, this outlook is subject to considerable
downside risks given the uncertainties facing the global and regional economies and the domestic
policy environment (see the section on managing risks).
4.

Inflation has been rising and

be around 6 percent (yoy) by end-June,

leaving the annual average rate at about 6½ percent for FY2012. Global food and fuel prices are
projected to trend downward over the medium term, offering some relief on inflation.
5.

The Central Bank of Samoa (CBS) has maintained an accommodative monetary policy

to support economic activity since the global financial crisis. Official interest rates are close to
zero and the CBS has recently increased
direct lending to the Development Bank of
Samoa and the Samoa Housing
Corporation, both of which on-lend to the
private sector at interest rates lower than
commercial banks charge. Banking sector
liquidity has tightened considerably

and the slow recovery of remittances and tourism. As reconstruction activity winds down, however,
the current account deficit is expected to trend downward over the medium term. Foreign reserves
have declined sharply over the past year, to about US$151 million (about 4.3 months of next year’s
imports) at end March, following some large one-off imports, profit repatriation by banks, and
outbound investment. While the tala’s nominal effective exchange rate (NEER) has been stable in
recent years, its real effective exchange rate (REER) has appreciated considerably as a result of
inflation differentials with trading partners.
7.

The fiscal deficit has fallen gradually after increasing to 7½ of GDP in 2009/10 to

support post-tsunami reconstruction.
The implementation of the 2011/12
budget is broadly on target, but
supplementary appropriations will likely
result in a fiscal deficit of 6 percent of
GDP, about ½ percent of GDP higher than
originally budgeted and only slightly
lower than the level achieved last year.

and a delay in increasing excises. Expenditure has also been broadly in line with budget projections,
with possible savings on recurrent expenditure.
8.

The authorities agreed that the Samoan economy has slowed down and has not

responded to the fiscal and monetary stimuli as anticipated. Their growth forecast for the
current fiscal year was slightly lower than staff’s projection, but they expect a long-term growth rate

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

5

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT SAMOA

of 3 percent, slightly more optimistic than staff’s forecast. The authorities’ inflation forecast for
FY2012 was similar to the staff forecast. The authorities agreed that the current account deficit has
been high but noted that the imports were related to reconstruction activity. They emphasized that
the foreign reserve level was still higher than the pre-tsunami level despite the sharp decline over
the past year.

4½ percent of GDP in 2012/13 and 3½ percent in 2013/14. The deficit should be further reduced to
2½ percent of GDP in 2014/15 and to about 1½ percent of GDP in the long run. This, based on the
debt sustainability analysis, would stabilize central government debt at 46 percent of GDP in present
value (PV) terms in 2016/17 and reduce it to 40 percent of GDP in 2025/26, a level that will give
Samoa the needed policy buffer to mount a fiscal response in the event of shocks. Staff continued to
consider it appropriate to target the PV of debt to GDP ratio at 40 percent given Samoa’s large and
stable remittances (some 20 percent of GDP), which help mitigate debt distress risks.
10.

It would be highly advisable that this debt target and the associated fiscal

consolidation path are spelled out in the government’s new medium-term fiscal strategy to
increase its credibility and gain political support. Further improvements in debt management,
including better coordination with fiscal policy formulation, stronger adherence to procedures to
contract debt, and improved efforts to contain the level of the government’s contingent liabilities,
would help achieve deficit and debt targets. The authorities reiterated their commitment to reducing

6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SAMOA 2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

public debt to a more sustainable level over the medium term. They are currently projecting a fiscal
deficit of 4–5 percent of GDP for FY2013 and plan to reduce it to below 3 percent by FY2015.
11.

Fiscal consolidation in 2012/13 will require rationalization of development projects,

but current expenditure should also be restrained in order to maintain a relatively high level
of public investment. Over the past three years, development expenditure has more than doubled,
reaching 18–19 percent of GDP in 2009/10 and 2010/11, before falling back to about 13½ percent in
2011/12. Just as the government reprioritized development expenditure as part of the post-tsunami
reconstruction efforts, so does it need to re-examine its priorities in a post-tsunami era, particularly
in line with the Strategy for the Development of Samoa. While it is important to budget adequate
resources to maintain expanded infrastructure and improve service delivery in key areas such as
health and education, further restraint on recurrent expenditure, including the public sector wage
bill, would be important. Samoa’s government wage bill has been one of the lowest in the region,
but it has been rising over a number of years. The hiving off of agency employees from the central
payroll led to some reductions in more recent years but these savings have moved to operating
grants provided to these agencies. The authorities were cognizant of the recent increases in the
government wage bill and planned to
initiate a functional and structural review of
the public service sector in FY2013 with a
view to reduce duplication and overlap in

The authorities indicated that they would take necessary actions to achieve this year’s

fiscal targets. The Ministry of Revenue was confident that the revenue target would be met despite
the weak economic activity. Samoa’s recent accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) is
unlikely to have any major impact on revenue collection. Ministry officials indicated that they would
build on the recent progress made under the Institutional Strengthening Program (ISP)—the
compliance rate has reached 85 percent for both income tax and customs—and implement the
second phase of the ISP with a focus on improvements in customs administration. They also advised

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

7

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT SAMOA

that further progress is being made with amendments to the Income Act and Tax Administration
Act. The Ministry of Finance noted that given the uncertainty over revenue collection greater
discretion would be exercised in authorizing spending—including a possible ban on non-externally
funded travel—in order to meet this year’s deficit target.
13.

It is critical that the government closely monitors debt incurred by public enterprises

(PEs) and contain the risk they pose to public finance. Although there appear to be no increase
over time, total non-current PE debt is substantial, amounting to ST366 million at end-June 2010, of
which ST54 million was in default and has been taken over by the government. At the end of 2011
the value of defaulted loans fell to ST45 million and other guaranteed outstanding loans amounted
to ST60 million. Some 46 percent of term loans, which account for about 52 percent of non-current
liabilities, are owed to commercial banks (about 11 percent of banks’ 2011 loan portfolio), 14
percent to the Samoa National Provident Fund, 24 percent to the European Investment Bank, and
the remaining 16 percent to the CBS and UTOS. The quality of loans extended by the Development
Bank of Samoa has deteriorated sharply over the past 2 years, with NPLs now standing at 29 percent
of total loans, up from 8 percent in June 2010. Near-to-medium term prospects for asset recovery
do not look promising given the weak economic conditions. UTOS has the admirable objective of
broadening investment opportunities for ordinary Samoans, but its current business model—
attracting PE deposits away from commercial banks at higher interest rates to compensate for the
shortage in individual investments and lending to other PEs at rates lower than bank rates—pose
considerable fiscal risks as the government has guaranteed UTOS loans and agreed to underwrite
some losses in the value of the shares the government continues to hold in privatized PEs and has
transferred to UTOS. Moreover, the government has agreed to advance any amount to the Trust to
pay its obligations, including the buyback of units should the Trust face cash flow constraints. The
authorities were of the view that SOE financing operations of UTOS, with total assets of less than
ST40 million, do not pose any additional fiscal risks and yet have increased competition in the credit
market. Moreover, the authorities saw the benefits of rallying political support for PE reform with
ordinary citizens sharing the profits earned from government-held shares in the privatized PEs.

increase, foreign reserves may come under pressure, especially if the recovery of remittances and
tourism continues to be weak. The current level of reserves is close to the estimated optimal level of
about 4½ months of current year imports, although this estimate is sensitive to the assumption of
the opportunity cost of holding reserves (see Appendix I). The real appreciation of the tala may have
also contributed importantly to the weak recovery of tourism, especially given increasing
competition from some other Pacific island countries that have either devalued their currencies (e.g.,
Fiji) or use the weaker U.S. dollar as the legal tender (Palau).
15.

assessments suggest that the tala is
overvalued by 11-25 percent (see Box 1).
Given this, a realignment of the exchange
rate would be necessary and important for
regaining Samoa’s competitiveness,
although its impact on inflation and debt
dynamics should be carefully considered in
the process. The authorities agreed that the
REER was probably overvalued but saw the

competitiveness was not clear. The authorities took note of staff’s view that declining agricultural
production and slowing tourism growth in recent years may have, at least partly, resulted from
reduced competitiveness as a result of exchange rate overvaluation. The authorities shared staff’s
view that the pegged exchange regime remains appropriate for Samoa given its underdeveloped
financial market and high price pass-through, which would render excessive exchange rate volatility if
the tala were floated.

16.

The staff would recommend a steady exchange rate realignment rather than a large

step-devaluation, which is likely to be disruptive. Specifically, the CBS could make use of the
existing rules that allow the exchange rate to move by 2 percent without cabinet approval or
restrictions on frequency. The exchange rate realignment could be accomplished over time through
this flexibility. Such an adjustment would have a positive impact over time on growth, which would
benefit from faster expansion of tourism and other exports, but the debt stock and service would
rise significantly, as would inflation (see Box 2 for an illustration of such possible effects). An
alternative to a nominal exchange rate realignment would be to tighten monetary policy to facilitate
the required external adjustment and avoid excessive losses in reserves. This would likely lead to
large output losses and put further strain on growth recovery. The authorities indicated that a
gradual exchange rate adjustment would be feasible, but noted that it would not have much impact
on exports due to the lack of supply response.

especially in the context of a possible realignment of the exchange rate—and should tighten
monetary policy in a pre-emptive manner given the weak monetary policy transmissions. In view of
the high pass-through of exchange rate changes, a firm monetary policy is critical to avoiding the
second-round effect on inflation of a realignment. Policy tightening should begin with increases in
the policy rate and open market operations, and if necessary, complemented by hiking reserve
requirements. While seeing the need to watch out for inflationary pressure and to tighten monetary
policy in the event of an exchange rate adjustment, the authorities noted that the monetary policy
should remain accommodative in the short run given the weak state of the economy.
18.

Staff suggested there should be no further increase in the CBS Credit Line Facility. The

initial tranche appears to have helped rehabilitate the tourism industry following the tsunami. Given
the recovery of credit growth since then and the fact the current financial difficulties with many
small tourism operators appear to have largely resulted from weak external demand, any benefits of

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SAMOA 2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

further expanding the facility are likely to be outweighed by the risk it poses to the CBS balance
sheet. Moreover, the facility could be converted into a fiscal operation, with an explicit budget
allocation, to improve transparency regarding the fiscal implications of this support. To reduce the
moral hazard problem, designated financial institutions for on-lending should share with the
government the credit risk arising from the facility. Recent diversion of PE deposits to UTOS may
have raised the funding costs for commercial banks and contributed to tight liquidity in some banks.
As a result, pressures are building for interest rates to rise. CBS should closely monitor the situation,
but there is no immediate need to systematically inject liquidity into banks.

MANAGING RISKS
19.

Risks to economic growth and stability in the short run stem primarily from Samoa’s

vulnerability to external shocks. Sharp or protracted downturns in the global economy would
pose serious challenges to the current efforts to strengthen recovery and maintain macroeconomic
stability, as shown over the past few years (see the Risk Assessment Matrix below). The strength of
the Australian, New Zealand and United States economies, which are Samoa’s largest trading
partners and main sources of remittances and tourist arrivals, are particularly important. Staff
discussed with the authorities the options of policy response in the event of a severe external shock,
including postponing fiscal consolidation, and, depending on the nature of the shock (falling
demand or worsening terms of trade) and the inflation outlook, accelerated adjustment of the tala
exchange rate to cushion the impact. Further monetary easing through open market operations and
lowering reserve requirements could also be considered should bank liquidity tighten, although past
experience has shown that the impact of such policies may be limited.
20.

Samoa is highly exposed to volatilities in global and domestic commodity prices,

particularly given its heavy reliance on imported fuel and food. Geopolitical uncertainties in the
Middle East could lead to unexpected surges in fuel prices. Weather conditions, especially cyclones
and extreme precipitations, could lead to large fluctuations in food prices, as occurred in 2004 and
the second half of 2011. Price hikes could result in rapid deterioration in the current account deficit
and rising inflation. Staff advised, and the authorities agreed, that Samoa should continue to allow
full price pass-through should international prices surge again. However, monetary policy should be
firm to prevent second-round effects of price surges. Moreover, Samoa should continue to rebuild
policy buffers and improve the social safety net despite the cushion provided by the traditional
community system.

Expected Impact on Samoa if
Threat is Realized
(high, medium or low)
Staff assessment: High

 The IMF WEO projections place
a low probability on a doubledip recession.
 Samoa would be exposed to a
drop in tourist arrivals,
remittances and demand for its
exports. FDI may also be
affected.
Staff assessment: Medium

 A severe shock like this could
reduce GDP growth in Samoa
by 1-2 percentage points and
unemployment would rise.
 Inflation is likely to fall as a
global recession leads to lower
commodity prices.

 Geopolitical uncertainty in the
Middle East and parts of Asia is
a non-negligible risk.
 Samoa heavily relies on
imports of food and fuel.

Staff assessment: Medium
Continued exchange rate
appreciation

21.

 Delays in actions to correct
exchange rate misalignment
because of the fear of inflation
and the belief that exchange
rate depreciation would not
help exports.

Staff assessment: High

 A 20 percent increase in food
and fuel prices could increase
the CPI by about 7 percentage
points.
 Current account deficit could
widen by about 3 percent of
GDP.
 Samoa has good communitybased social protection
networks, so the impact on
poverty would be small.
Staff assessment: Medium
 Competitiveness would remain
weak, leading to slow growth.
 Trade balance would worsen
and reserves would eventually
fall to inadequate levels.

Samoa also faces considerable risks to sustained growth and stability over the medium

term. The global financial crisis and the restructuring of the automobile industry in Australia seem
to have led to a long-lasting, and possibly permanent, scale down of the Yazaki auto part plant,
which has shed over 1,000 workers since the onset of the global financing crisis. The plant remains
the largest private employer in the formal sector but its survival appears to depend entirely on a
single car manufacturing plant in Australia (reduced from three). Recent efforts to expand exports
into the Chinese market are encouraging, but it will take a while to yield significant results. The
prospects for sustained growth of tourism hinge on the future development of the real exchange
12

rate as well as source country demand; further REER appreciation could dampen growth over the
medium term. On the upside, Samoa could benefit from increased access to Australia’s temporary
workers scheme and receive more remittances. The recent accession to the WTO could also help
improve investor confidence, though the impact is unlikely to be large.

RAISING LONG-TERM GROWTH
22.

Restoring Samoa’s strong growth would require continued structural reforms. Samoa

undertook substantial reforms in the mid-1990s and these reforms had contributed to the strong
growth prior to the current slowdown. However, the growth impact of these reforms seems to be
tapering off. Continued fiscal consolidation would dampen aggregate demand, though with an
imports-to-GDP ratio of 74 percent and even higher import content for public investment projects,
the impact of reduced public spending would be moderate, particularly given the envisaged gradual
consolidation. Samoa has been leading Pacific island countries in the World Bank’s “doing business”
indicators, but several countries are narrowing their gaps with Samoa. A recent report based on a
conference organized by UNCTAD on Samoa’s WTO accession suggests that there is considerable
room for improvement. While an exchange rate realignment would help strengthen Samoa’s
competitiveness over time, the expected benefits would not be fully realized without simultaneous
structural reforms to raise efficiency and alleviate supply constraints. Reforms would also ease the
transition from government-driven recovery to a more broad based, private sector-led growth.
23.

Public enterprise reforms are a top priority. Important progress has been made recently,

including the privatization of Samoa Tel in January 2011 and the establishment of the Independent
Selection Committee for directors of PE boards. Nevertheless, continued efforts will be needed as
many public enterprises are performing poorly. The government recognizes the importance of
improving the efficiency of PEs and has undertaken legal and corporate governance reforms to this
end (see Box 3). The authorities plan to privatize three PEs in the next fiscal year.
24.

Considerable progress has been made in tapping customary land for productive use

and further advances would be important to promote private investment. As detailed in Box 4,
important steps have been taken to update the institutional and legal framework for customary
land, but the use of customary land as collateral for bank loans remains a key constraint on lending,
discouraging private investment and restricting growth potential. Continued dialogue and
consultation with land owners and the community at large to build consensus is critical to move the

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT SAMOA

reform forward. Staff welcomed the initiation of the third phase of customary land reforms
supported by ADB advisory TA. While acknowledging the room for improvement, the authorities
cautioned that the land issues could be easily exaggerated.
25.

Consolidation of recent achievements should be the focus of the continued effort to

improve public financial management (PFM). Staff welcomed the plan for the second phase of
PFM reforms following a Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) assessment carried
out in early 2010. The implementation of this plan would help develop sector plans for improved
linkages to the budget, strengthen the budget process, procurement, and the accounting system,
and improve tax administration as well as debt management and aid cooperation policy. To
successfully implement this plan, Cabinet support to the plan would be critical and central agencies
and line ministries would need to strengthen staff capacity to sustain the reform process.
26.

Continued reforms in the financial sector would be important in lifting growth and

ensuring financial stability. Staff welcomed the recent Cabinet approval of the proposed Personal
Property Securities Act, which will allow moveable assets to be used as credit security, and looked
forward to its early passage in Parliament. Similarly, establishing a credit bureau would help reduce
credit risk and boost credit to the private sector. To ensure financial sector stability in an
environment of rising NPLs for some banks, the CBS should strengthen bank supervision (especially
on-site examinations) and be assigned the responsibility for supervising the UTOS and Samoa
Housing Corporation (SHC). Staff also advised that UTOS should move away from subsidizing public
enterprises through extending loans to them at below-market rates. This would also help generate
higher returns for investors in the long run. As UTOS diversifies its investment into the private sector
(including property markets) and foreign markets as envisaged, it needs to build its capacity for risk
management. The authorities agreed with staff that CBS should supervise UTOS and SHC and step
up its supervision efforts to ensure financial stability amid increasing financial difficulties in the
private sector, particularly in tourism. The authorities saw the benefits of a credit bureau, but would
rather leave it to banks to take the next step in establishing it.
27.

A review of Samoa's social safety schemes may be in order. The Samoa National Pension

Fund (NPF) is a defined contribution scheme. At present, almost all its members take lump-sum
withdrawals rather than an annuity. Moreover, over 40 percent of members’ contributions to the
Fund have been taken out in member loans, significantly diminishing the role of the NPF in
providing retirement incomes for members close to retirement at age 55. There is also a Senior
Citizens Benefits Scheme for permanent residents aged 65 years and over and generous medical
care provided by the government (full coverage of treatment and medication costs). In combination,

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SAMOA 2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

these schemes appear to have diminished incentives to save for retirement. As a result, there is likely
to be an increase in the fiscal burden in the long run, especially as life expectancy increases and
traditional family ties weaken over time with urbanization and migration. Staff saw a need to tighten
the criteria for member loans and to undertake a review of the various schemes. On the investment
side, around 28 percent of NPF's investment consists of loans to poorly performing public
enterprises. Although these are mostly guaranteed by the government, efforts to allow gradual
portfolio diversification via greater investments overseas would help minimize exposure to financial
and fiscal risk. The authorities noted that the full withdrawal option and its use are in line with
cultural tradition in Samoa.

OTHER ISSUES
28.

Statistics. Samoa’s economic statistics are broadly adequate for surveillance. The country is

one of the few in the Pacific that disseminate monthly and quarterly economic statistics through
government websites. However, there are weaknesses in national accounts and balance of payments
statistics. With technical assistance, including through PFTAC, considerable progress is being made
in improving these statistics and the authorities are committed to continued efforts. Central
government accounting is on cash basis. The authorities are currently receiving assistance from
PFTAC in transition to the GFSM2001 format. GFSM2001 format data is expected to be available
before the next staff visit.

STAFF APPRAISAL
29.

Samoa’s economy continues to recover, albeit at a modest pace. Real GDP growth is

expected to be around 1½ percent for FY2012 and rise to about 2 percent in FY2013. The mediumterm outlook points to a moderate growth rate of around 2½ percent, a step-down from Samoa’s
strong growth record prior to the current slowdown. Risk to growth is tilted to the downside in the
short run, mainly as a result of uncertainty over the global economy and the outlook for regional
trading partners and source countries of remittances and tourists.
30.

A series of shocks have changed Samoa’s macroeconomic landscape, reducing

substantially the country’s fiscal and external buffers. Public debt has risen sharply as a result of
fiscal stimulus in the wake of the global financial crisis and a devastating tsunami. At the same time,
monetary policy was eased and has remained accommodative ever since, and yet economic recovery
remains weak and fragile. The current account balance has deteriorated sharply, but generous donor
support has kept reserves at comfortable levels. The authorities should be commended for
managing the difficult circumstances.
31.

However, decisive actions are now needed to reduce the fiscal deficit and bring public

debt to a more sustainable level over the medium term. Given the weak and fragile state of the
recovery, however, fiscal consolidation should be measured and steady in the short run. It is highly
advisable that a medium-term path for fiscal consolidation be spelled out with a corresponding debt
management strategy to ensure appropriate levels of borrowings. Moreover, debt incurred by public
enterprises should be closely monitored with improved statistics and their fiscal risks minimized.
32.

The authorities’ fiscal plans for FY2013 are broadly appropriate. However, to achieve a

deficit target of 4-5 percent of GDP would require firm control over recurrent expenditure as well as
reprioritization of development expenditure. Restraint on recurrent expenditure, including the public
sector wage bill, will be important, not least to allow adequate resources to be devoted to the
maintenance of expanded infrastructure and improvements in health and education services.
Revenue efforts have been commendable and should continue.
33.

Samoa needs to examine its export competitiveness and adjusts its exchange rate as

necessary. The tala has appreciated substantially in real effective terms over the past decade and it
is assessed to be overvalued. While the current level of reserves appears to be broadly adequate, a

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SAMOA 2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

steady realignment of the exchange rate may be necessary to prevent further reserve losses and
strengthen export competitiveness, including in the tourism industry.
34.

Monetary policy stance can remain accommodative for the time being, but would

need tightening when exchange rate adjustment takes place. With the weak economic activity,
there appears to be little underlying inflationary pressure at present. However, given the expected
high price pass-through, CBS needs to stand ready to tighten the policy stance in order to prevent
the second-round effect of an exchange rate realignment.
35.

Continued structural reforms would be vital to restore Samoa’s strong growth record.

The current protracted growth downturn appears to reflect the diminishing benefits of the widely
acclaimed reforms in the mid-1990s as well as real exchange rate appreciation and external shocks,
which have dented Samoa’s competitiveness. The authorities are encouraged to undertake bold
reforms, focusing on raising the efficiency of public enterprises, further improving public financial
management, making customary land more accessible for productive use, and deepening financial
sector reforms.
36.

Managing risks should be part of the overall effort to ensure macroeconomic stability

and sustained growth. Given Samoa’s vulnerability to exogenous shocks, it should continue to
build policy buffers through determined efforts to consolidate its fiscal position and avoid delays in
necessary adjustment to monetary and exchange rate policies.
37.

It is recommended that the Article IV consultation continue on the current 24 month cycle

with a staff visit in the next 12 months.

Box 1. Exchange Rate Assessment
Three standard approaches have been applied to assess
the value of the tala relative to its medium-term
equilibrium level. The results show that the tala is likely
to be about 11–25 percent above its equilibrium level.
The Macroeconomic Balance (MB) approach suggests
that Samoa’s current account norm is about -4.3 percent of GDP. The decomposition of the fitted values into
time-varying contributions shows economic growth, oil
trade balance and aid inflows are the main factors in
determining the norm. While Samoa’s current account
deficit is projected to gradually decline to 8.4 percent of
GDP by 2016/17 with fiscal consolidation and the
rebound of tourism and remittances from the impact of
the global financial crisis and the tsunami, a gap is likely
to remain, implying that the tala is overvalued by
12-25 percent based on a range of elasticities.

5/ Current account deficit that stabilizes net foreign liabilities,

The Equilibrium Real Exchange Rate (ERER) approach
shows that the tala is overvalued by about 17 percent.
In this approach, key determinants of the equilibrium
value are government consumption, labor productivity,
aid inflows and terms of trade. The REER was around its
equilibrium level in 2007/2008 but has since deviated from it rapidly, largely as a result of higher domestic
inflation and nominal appreciation in 2008-09.
The External Stability (ES) approach, which estimates the current account norm that stabilizes net foreign assets
at a targeted level, suggests the tala is overvalued by about 11–22 percent. The target for net foreign assets, at
76 percent of GDP, was derived from the current account balances during the period 2006/07–2008/09, which
is considered to be broadly sustainable.
As with assessments for many other countries, the results presented here are subject to considerable
uncertainty, mainly because small economies such as Samoa are volatile and their economic fundamentals can
be altered by exogenous shocks.

Box 2. An Exchange Rate Adjustment Scenario
This box presents a scenario of gradual exchange realignment for Samoa. The advantage of such a
gradual approach is that it allows time for businesses and consumers to adjust to changing economic
circumstances and hence is less disruptive to economic activities. However, this approach could also
invite one-way bids on exchange rate movements, although this risk is mitigated somewhat by the fact
that Samoa’s capital inflows are almost entirely in the forms of foreign direct investment and official
grants and loans. In contrast, such risk could be avoided through a well-planned one-off surprise
adjustment. The scenario is purely for illustration purposes.
Suppose that the real exchange rate adjustment needed is about 12 percent over two years. The target
for nominal adjustment should be around 20 percent assuming inflation would rise by about 8
percentage points. This ballpark estimate of inflation impact assumes full price pass-through and is
broadly in line with the fact that just over 40 percent of Samoa’s CPI basket is imported. Given that a
number of products are under price control, full price pass-through may not take place over two years
and some price increases, say 2 percentage points, would spill over to the third year. Assuming
baseline inflation is 4 percent and the exchange rate is adjusted by 10 percent each in FY2013 and
FY2014, inflation would rise to 7 percent in these two years and to 6 percent in FY2015.
In addition to inflation, the exchange rate adjustment would have several effects on the Samoan
economy. The resulting real appreciation would provide a boost to the tradables, such as tourism and
agricultural products. At the same time, it would

One of the negative consequences of such an exchange rate adjustment is an increase in debt stock
and service, as most of Samoa’s public debt is external and denominated in foreign currencies. It is
estimated that Samoa’s external debt in PV terms could peak at about 48 percent of GDP in 2016/17
before falling back below 40 percent in 2023/24. This would mean that Samoa would remain at
moderate level of debt distress risk as in the baseline.

Box 3. Improving the efficiency of Public Enterprises
Public enterprises (PEs) make up a significant proportion of Samoa’s economy—there are 28 PEs
(17 public trading bodies, 3 public mutual bodies and 8 public beneficial bodies) which are mandated
to deliver services to the public. From a budgetary perspective, satisfactory financial performance of
these enterprises is crucial because their profits are needed to service the capital (loan or equity)
provided by the government. From an economic perspective, generation of income and paying
dividends by public enterprises is critical to ensure that capital is not locked up in low-productivity
activities and depleted over time. Many public enterprises are, however, performing poorly.
The government is committed to improving the quality and strengthening the impact of performance
monitoring of the PEs. The Ministry of Finance is responsible for ensuring that PEs conform to the
Public Bodies Act (2001) and monitors their performance and accountability standards. All PEs are
mandated by law to operate as successful businesses, and obligated by the Ministry of Finance to
generate a return on equity of 7 percent. However, during the 8-year period 2002-2010, the
15 commercial PEs returned only 0.3 percent on equity and 0.2 percent on average assets of over
850 million tala.
The government recognizes the importance of improving PE efficiency and has undertaken legal and
corporate governance reforms to this end. The passage of the Composition Act in early 2012 is an
important milestone for PE reform. The Act has paved the way for the appointment of 180 board
directors (many of them are new to PE boards) and the removal of ex-officio directors from all PE
boards, with the exception of the Development Bank of Samoa and the National Provident Fund. This
process, which is expected to have been completed by end April 2012, will allow the boards of the PEs
to operate more independently of political influence and in so doing become more accountable for
their performance.
The pace of reform is picking up. Following the successful privatization of Samoa Tel, the government
is committed to continuing the privatization of non-strategic PEs including the Trust Estate
Corporation, the Agricultural Store Corporation and the Samoa Shipping Services. Successful reforms in
the PE sector are pivotal to the overall economic reform process in Samoa. The government has
requested technical assistance from the ADB to progress these reforms.

Box 4. Promoting Economic Use of Customary Land
Customary land is probably Samoa’s most important natural resource, but it is far from being fully
utilized. Large areas remain underdeveloped despite many years of efforts. Many aspects of customary
land are enshrined in law such as the Constitution of the Independent State of Samoa, the Alienation of
Customary Land Act 1965, Taking of Lands Act 1964, and the Village Fono Act 1984. The legal
boundaries of customary land vested in Samoan family titles are not always clearly defined and
establishing clear title to the land is costly and time consuming. A key challenge is how to make
customary land available as security for bank loans to allow for its development for the benefit of
owners and investors alike. Sharing the rewards and benefits from leasing and licensing of customary
land is a central plank in recent customary land reforms.
The government has made considerable progress in instigating customary land reforms. For example,
the Land Title Registration Act 2009 (replacing the Land and Titles Act 1981) was implemented on 31
March 2010; the land Registry is now fully computerized; a Customary Land Advisory Commission was
established; and the Customary Land Leasing Section within the Lands Division of the Ministry of
National Resources and Environment has been set up. Changes to customary land legislation have also
been supported to streamline processes and procedures to lease customary land.
Despite these efforts, much remains to be done in promoting the economic use of customary land. The
use of customary land as collateral for bank loans remains one of the biggest impediments to lending.
The multiple ownership structure of the land and the sensitivity surrounding ownership and use of
land, combined with the fact that much of customary land in its current status has little marketable
value, means that banks remain cautious with respect to accepting customary land as security against
business loans. This has also possibly contributed to higher demand for loans from the provident fund
for which pension savings are used as collateral.
The reform process is ongoing and further progress will require much extensive consultation in view of
the sensitivity of the issues involved. Given the government’s policy not to alienate customary land, the
key task ahead is to build consensus on a legal framework and acceptable commercial practices and
processes that would open up investment, possibly through leases that are bankable and transferable
without affecting communal ownership. In this regard, ongoing dialogue and consultation with land
owners and the community at large to build consensus will be a critical aspect of the reform. This is a
complicated and costly process that could take years before it bears fruits. Capacity constraints (for
example, availability of legal professionals and land use specialists) could further impede the pace of
the reform process. ADB is providing advisory technical assistance to support a third phase of
Customary Land Reforms (US$900,000) to move the process forward.

APPENDIX I: SAMOA—RESERVE ADEQUACY
Samoa’s foreign reserves stood at US$151 million (about 4.3 months of next year’s imports)
as of end-March 2012. Although this amount is significantly lower than the level at end-June 2010
(US$175.8 million), it is still higher than the pre-tsunami level. Samoa’s foreign reserves experienced
an overall increase during 2006-08, reaching about US$123 million in September 2009. Reserves
surged in the wake of the tsunami as a result of increased aid flows, an IMF SDR allocation, and a
disbursement of emergency assistance under the Rapid-Access Component of the Fund’s
Exogenous Shocks Facility. The decline over the past year reflected the rising food and fuel prices,
large one-off imports, profit repatriation by banks and outbound investment, as well as continued
reconstruction activities, albeit on a declining scale. Sluggish recovery of remittances and tourism
has also contributed to the decline in reserves. This trend is expected to continue due to increases in
debt repayments and continuation of weak tourism and remittances.
Samoa’s foreign reserves have been generally lower than the regional median, although they
have been mostly above threemonth import coverage—the
traditional rule of thumb for
reserve adequacy. The recent
declines have put Samoa’s reserves at

CBS’s target of 4 months of current year’s imports.
Staff analysis based on recent Fund methodologies for low-income countries suggests the
optimal reserve holdings for Samoa are about 4½ months of imports. It should be noted that
the estimate is sensitive to the assumed opportunity cost of holding reserves. The methodologies
are essentially a cost-benefit analysis framework, whereby the optimal level of reserves is
determined when the crisis prevention and mitigation benefits of reserves in smoothing absorption
are balanced against the net financial cost of reserves, defined as foregone investment opportunities
measured by the marginal product of capital. An important feature of this framework is that optimal

current account deficit. In calculating
the optimal levels of reserves for Samoa, the opportunity cost of holding reserves was proxied by
the average real bank lending rate of the past two years, estimated at about 3.8 percent.
It should be noted that the methodologies applied here are based on parameters derived
from data on low-income countries. In fact, small countries such as Samoa were excluded from
the data. Given this, results reported here should be treated with great caution. There is great
uncertainty over the opportunity cost of holding reserves. The number used in this analysis is toward
the lower end of available estimates for low-income countries (3-6 percent). With respect to the
methodologies, the assumption of risk neutrality and the fact that Samoa is much smaller than a
typical low-income country may lead to a downward bias for the estimates of optimal reserve
holdings—small island economies are more vulnerable to exogenous shocks and may need higher
levels of reserves, other things being equal.

SAMOA

ANNEX II. SAMOA––PFTAC COUNTRY STRATEGY
2012-2014
Background
Samoa has faced a difficult macroeconomic environment in recent times. Following the global
economic crisis growth stagnated, remittances fell and fiscal revenues declined sharply. This was
exacerbated by a devastating tsunami in mid-2009. Samoa responded with a substantial fiscal
stimulus financed by domestic and external debt accumulation and also with monetary stimulus
including central bank lending to nonbank financial institutions. Growth has however been slow to
pick up and with fiscal deficits still relatively high, debt levels elevated and international reserves
declining, the authorities will continue to face macroeconomic management challenges. Fortunately,
with strong policy frameworks, good donor dialogue and coordination and a number of large
institutional strengthening projects (ISP) already in place, Samoa is well placed to meet these
challenges.
PFTAC has provided moderate TA to Samoa in recent years mainly on macro-fiscal and
statistics. PFTAC TA was instrumental in setting up a medium-term budgeting system and the
development of quarterly national accounts in Samoa, both of which are now supported by ISPs.
Recent TA has been primarily in the macroeconomic area and is focused on developing a more
reliable macroeconomic framework for the budget. Support has also been provided in Samoa’s
modernization of its income tax legislation.
Strategy 2012–2014
PFTAC’s TA strategy is guided by the APD regional strategy note and is planned within the results
framework for PFTAC’s funding cycle.1
PFTAC TA aims to support the authorities sustain progress on fiscal consolidation and to
improve the macroeconomic environment. PFTAC will continue to focus on building
macroeconomic analysis capacity and delivering specific technical inputs in the context of larger ISPs.
One instance of this is expected to be support to assessing revenue potential.

The specific result in the framework that activities target is identified in italics in the section, for example cash
management is referred to as (1.6), where 1.6 is the code in the result framework in the program document.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SAMOA

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

In the Public Financial Management area, inputs are expected to be relatively small given the large
project-based support available to support the Ministry of Finance’s PFM reform plan. PFTAC will be
available to provide follow-up support to previous work to strengthen the medium-term budgeting
system (1.5). In the medium-term, PFTAC would look to assist the authorities implement a follow-up
PEFA assessment, probably in 2014 (1.1).
Assistance in the macroeconomics area will continue to be instrumental to the success of budget
reforms. PFTAC will continue assisting Ministry of Finance improve the accuracy and sophistication of
its revenue and GDP forecasting (5.1, 5.3) and in building capacity to produce its own debt
sustainability analyses (5.4). This work will continue to aim to build stronger links with the Central
Bank of Samoa (CBS)
In the revenue area, Samoa has made great strides in improving administration, which was reflected
in an award at the 2011 PITAA annual meeting. Reflecting this, PFTAC hopes to draw on Samoan
experiences to provide advice to other PFTAC members. Support to Samoa’s revenue administration
will continue to be mainly delivered under the ISP, which will include implementation of selfassessment (2.4) in line with the modernized income tax act, prepared with PFTAC support. PFTAC is
ready to supplement the ISP, most likely through assisting the authorities undertake a strategic
revenue review in late 2012 that will analyze recent revenue developments and identify policy (2.1)
and administrative (2.2-2.5) actions that could help increase revenues. This may identify other areas
for PFTAC support, including developing risk management and compliance strategies (2.5).
In statistics, Samoa is relatively well advanced against the overall results framework; based on PFTAC
advice, it produces quarterly National Accounts on 2 independent measures (4.1) with production of
a range of income indicators (4.3). Balance of payments statistics are now being developed according
to BPM6 standards (4.8). Further development is expected to continue under the ISP, although
PFTAC can assist with major methodological developments and rebases in the national accounts (4.1
and 4.2) and IMF HQ will offer support in Balance of Payments.
In financial sector supervision, PFTAC will be ready to assist CBS adapt the base set of prudential
returns developed by AFSPC to the Samoan context in advance of the regional implementation of
RBNZ’s Financial Sector Information System (FSIS) (3.1, 3.2). CBS currently relies on APRA for training
support in conducting on-site bank examinations, but PFTAC would be ready to supplement this if
requested.

ANNEX III: SAMOA––RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN
DEVELOPMENT BANK GROUP
The Asian Development Bank operations in Samoa started in 1966: As at year-end 2011, 35 loans
($186.19 million), 7 ADF grants ($43.81 million), and 87 TA projects for $28.86 million have been
provided to Samoa. Three loans ($45.49 million), 3 ADF grants ($27.06 million), and 5 TA projects
($2.19 million) are active.
The Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) 2008-12 for Samoa focuses on poverty reduction with three
pillars for intervention: (i) removal of infrastructure constraints, (ii) improvement of access and
delivery of public services, and (iii) promotion of private sector development. The CPS builds on a
coordinated strategy with the other main development partners through focusing on sectors where
ADB has a strong comparative advantage, particularly power, water, sanitation, drainage and private
sector development.
ADB completed its country operations business plan (COBP) 2012-2014 in July 2011, adopting a
harmonized approach to donor assistance with other development partners and maintaining the
focus of the CPS and ADB’s Pacific Approach targeting improvement of growth prospects and living
standards, especially for disadvantaged members of the community. The COBP is closely aligned with
the Strategy for the Development of Samoa (SDS).
Samoa has received support from the Pacific Infrastructure Advisory Center (PIAC) for infrastructure
master planning and has also participated in the PIAC initiative for strengthening of power and water
utilities. The country also benefits from the advisory services of the Pacific Financial Technical
Assistance Center. Samoa has received ADB regional technical assistance for economic management
for development results, energy efficiency, statistics and private sector development (including SOE
reforms and secured transactions). ADB continues to include Samoa in new regional TA activities,
Most recently in April 2010 the Economic Recovery Support Program (totaling US$26.8 million) was
approved. ADB approved a loan of $16 million for the first subprogram in 2010 with the second
subprogram of $10.82 million approved in late 2011. Future assistance will focus on energy
investments to improve access and bring down prices. The government has confirmed its interest in
a renewable energy project as part of the COBP. ADB will also continue to support reforms to

Samoa has an IDA-15 (FY09–FY11) allocation of $40 million. Samoa’s IDA-15 allocation was more than
doubled to respond to the devastating tsunami that occurred on September 29, 2009.
The Bank’s current activities in Samoa are in the following areas:
1)

Transport Sector

Infrastructure Asset Management Phase 2: The objective of this second-phase program (approved
December 2003, US$12.8 million plus additional finance of US$8 million and significant trust fund
support), to be carried out over a period of eight years, is to enhance the economic, environmental and
social sustainability of transport and coastal infrastructure assets, and to manage these assets, natural
resources, and disaster risks through an effective partnership with private sector stakeholders. The success
of efforts to build private sector contracting capacity––a central element of the program––was evident in
the rapid and effective response by the Samoan Government and private sector to tsunami recovery and
reconstruction efforts.
Post Tsunami Road Reconstruction Project: The development objective of this project is to assist the
Government of Samoa in its efforts to support the relocation and rehabilitation of communities living on
the island of Upolu affected by the tsunami of September 2009, through the provision of improved
infrastructure access to relocation sites, enhanced transport infrastructure and assistance to local
communities to address future natural disasters. The project is being implemented in conjunction with the
current successful SIAM2 operation and is co-financed with a US$1.8 million grant from the Pacific Region
Infrastructure Facility.
2)

Health Sector

Health Sector Management Program: Through the Health Sector Management project (approved June
2008, IDA US$3 million), the Bank is supporting the government’s reform program aimed at promoting
preventative healthcare, and ensuring equitable access to a modern, effective, efficient health service,
delivered in close collaboration with the private sector. Implementation is done using a sector-wide
approach with co-financing from AUSAID and NZAP, and in close coordination with other health sector
development partners such as UNFPA and WHO. Samoa is broadly on track to meet health sector MDGs.
Additional Financing - Health Sector Management Program: Additional financing of US$3 million
was provided to assist Samoa in addressing pressures on the health system emerging as a result of
the tsunami.

Agriculture Sector

Agriculture Competitiveness Enhancement Project: The development objective of the project is to
support fruit and vegetable growers and livestock producers to improve their productivity and take
greater advantage of market opportunities. The project will cover 3 components – (i) livestock production
and marketing, (ii) fruit and vegetable production and marketing, and (iii) institutional strengthening of
agricultural institutions. Co-financing of US$5million grant is provided from the Food Price Crisis Response
Core Multi-donor Trust Fund.
IFC has been active in Samoa, particularly in the telecoms sector. IFC has invested US$18.5 million in
Digicel, encouraging this new private operator to enter the liberalized Samoan telecoms market. This has
been a crucial element in the successes achieved in improving connectivity in Samoa. IFC investments have
encouraged over US$80 million in total private investment in the telecoms sector, making this the largest
single private investment in Samoa. IFC has also been providing assistance to the tourism sector and
recently to the Ministry of Justice & Courts Administration for establishment of its courts mediation unit.
In support of a significantly scaled up program, the Bank in November 2009 opened a joint liaison
office in Samoa, in conjunction with the Asian Development Bank.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Approved By

Masato Miyazaki and Taline Koranchelian
(IMF) Sudhir Shetty and Jeffrey D. Lewis (IDA)

Prepared by

International Monetary Fund
International Development Association

This joint IMF-WB debt sustainability analysis (DSA) shows that Samoa has shifted to moderate
from low risk of debt distress.1 Compared to the previous DSA (see 2010 Article IV Staff Report),
this analysis assumes a slightly lower medium- and long-term growth rate of GDP in the
baseline given the less favorable external environment and the dissipation of the benefits of
earlier reforms. The analysis finds that there is a large and protracted breach of the present value
of debt to GDP threshold in an exchange rate shock scenario. Given the rising debt burden,
forceful policy actions, especially on the fiscal front, would be needed to ensure medium- and
long-term debt sustainability.

1

This DSA was prepared by IMF and IDA staffs in accordance with the standard methodology for low-income
countries. It is based on the general framework approved by the Executive Boards of the IMF and the World Bank,
including the recent revisions to the framework endorsed by the two Boards (SM/12/10)

Samoa is currently faced with the challenge of slow growth and high volatility arising

from exogenous shocks. The economy is particularly exposed to external factors impacting
tourism, remittances and aid which Samoa is largely reliant on. Goods exports are small and
comprise a limited number of agricultural products.
2.

The Samoan economy has not fully recovered from the impact of the global financial

crisis and the 2009 tsunami. Tourism is still declining, albeit at a slower pace. Reconstruction
activity, which has been supporting economic recovery, is in the process of winding down. Growth is
projected to be around 1½-2 percent in the short term and rise to 2½ percent over the medium
term which is close to the 10-year historical average. This outlook is subject to considerable
uncertainty given the current global, regional and domestic environment.
3.

The fiscal expansion following the global slowdown and the tsunami was supported by

both multilateral (ADB and IDA) and bilateral partners (Australia, New Zealand, China, and
Japan). Samoa has benefited from grants and concessional loans, which have made its debt stock
much smaller in present value terms and debt repayment much less costly.
4.

At the end of 2010/2011 fiscal year, the face value of public external debt was

estimated at 737.7 million tala (48 percent of GDP) and domestic debt at 48.9 million tala
(3.9 percent of GDP). Multilateral creditors account for 71 percent of Samoa’s external debt
(including 32.3 percent owed to the World Bank, 35.3 percent to ADB, and 3.4 percent to OPEC,
IFAD, EEC and EIB). Bilateral creditors (JICA, China, and France) account for approximately 29 percent
of the external debt.
5.

Samoa has managed its debt relatively well with most of external government debt

being contracted on concessional terms. Non-concessional loans from OPEC are small and attract
interest rates ranging from 2.75 percent to 4.5 percent while those on other loans range from
0.45 percent to 2.5 percent.
6.

The central government’s net domestic debt is small. Treasury bonds outstanding are

worth only 0.4 million tala with interest rates ranging from 5 percent to 7 percent. The government
has assumed the responsibility for repaying a number of public enterprise (PE) loans that are in
default with an outstanding balance of 48.5 million tala at end of FY 2011. PE liabilities, although
backed by their assets, represent a fiscal risk to the government. Total current liabilities are reported

to be at 100.9 million tala at the end of 2010 fiscal year and non-current liabilities at 267.9 million
tala. Not all PE balance sheets were available as of end of 2011 fiscal year.

METHODOLOGY AND ASSUMPTIONS
7.

Debt sustainability is assessed in relation to policy-dependent debt burden thresholds.

Samoa is classified as a “strong performer” according to the three-year average of IDA’s Country
Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) index under the joint IMF/IDA debt sustainability
framework.2 Samoa’s debt is therefore assessed against higher thresholds compared to countries
that have a weaker governance and policy environment.3
8.

This DSA is based on updated data provided by the authorities supplemented with

staffs’ estimates. It covers borrowings by the central government and public enterprises (including
defaulted public enterprise loans currently being repaid by government) based on available data
and forecasts. The DSA uses non-reconciled debt data and a single discount rate of 4 percent.
9.

Key assumptions underlying the baseline DSA are consistent with the macroeconomic

framework developed during the 2012 Article IV consultation and afterwards. These
assumptions are as follows except for the modifications specified in alternative scenarios:


Annual real GDP growth is projected at 1.5 percent for fiscal year 2011/12, improving
gradually to 2.5 percent over the long term, which is higher than the average GDP
growth of 0.9 percent for 2005/06-2010/11, a period when the Samoan economy
was subject to a series of adverse shocks.



Average inflation is assumed to be about 6.0 percent for 2011/12, falling to
2.0 percent in 2012-2013. Over the medium term, inflation is projected to be about
4.0 percent (about the historical average) and falling to 3.0 percent over the long
term, in line with the target set by the Central Bank of Samoa (CBS).

2

Three year average CPIA rating for Samoa is 4.06.

3

According to the 2012 review of the Debt Sustainability Framework for Low Income Countries, the thresholds for
“strong performers” are: 50 percent for PV of debt to GDP; 200 percent for PV of debt to exports; 300 percent for PV
of debt to revenues; 25 percent debt service to exports; and 22 percent debt service to revenues.



Samoa

A constant real effective exchange rate is assumed for the medium term, and, for
simplicity, a constant real exchange rate against the U.S. dollar is assumed over the
long run.



Annual goods and services export growth is assumed at about 4 percent in nominal
US dollar terms. The external non-interest current account deficit is projected at
about 10½ percent of GDP in 2011/12 falling to about 8 percent by 2016/17. An
annual average current account balance of slightly lower than 8 percent of GDP is
assumed over the 2018-32 period. The current account deficit is expected to be
largely financed by grants and concessional loans from development partners.



A fiscal consolidation is assumed to take place over the medium term, gradually
reducing the fiscal deficit to 2½ percent of GDP. Over the longer term, the deficit will
be further reduced and maintained at 1½ percent of GDP. Revenues are assumed to
remain constant at about 32 percent of GDP, and development expenditure is
reduced to about 11 percent of GDP, financed by grants, concessional loans and
domestic resources. This is 7 percentage points below the level during the posttsunami reconstruction period which included one-off donor support. Current
expenditure in the long run is assumed to be about 22 percent of GDP, following a
gradual decline from 25 percent of GDP over the medium term, consistent with
phasing out of reconstruction projects and the authorities intention to streamline the
public administration sector. Samoa’s interest expenditure is not large as most
borrowing is on concessional terms.



New external borrowing will be required (largely available on concessional terms) to
finance the fiscal deficit. Central government domestic debt is about 3 percent of
GDP and PE debt about 27 percent of GDP (excluding defaulted loans that the
government has taken over). Assumptions about new borrowing include budget
support loans from multilateral development partners. PE borrowing is assumed to
be on commercial terms. Continued eligibility for concessional borrowing from IDA
is assumed during the forecast period.



PE balance sheet data for 2011 fiscal year was incomplete. For the purposes of public
sector DSA it is assumed that there is no change in the debt levels from 2010 fiscal
year for PEs with missing balance sheet information for 2011 fiscal year. PE debt is
assumed to be constant as a percentage of GDP for the projection period.

EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
10.

Under the baseline scenario, all initial debt ratios are below the policy-dependent

thresholds for a low income country classified as a strong performer on policy ratings.
Nevertheless, these ratios are projected to exceed the target of 40 percent of GDP in PV terms set
by the authorities (Figure 1; Tables 1a, 1b and 1c), reflecting the continued need to borrow and the
rapid accumulation of external debt as a result of fiscal expansion in the wake of the global financial
crisis and the tsunami.
11.

Stress tests indicate that Samoa faces a moderate risk of debt distress, a step up from

its low risk status in the last assessment. The increase in risk of debt distress reflects weaker
output growth and slower fiscal consolidation in comparison to the last DSA. Samoa’s external debt
situation is generally resilient but shocks would lead to a sharp initial worsening in debt indicators.
The most extreme stress tests show that an exchange rate shock of 30 percent would push the PV of
public external debt as a share of GDP from 39 percent in 2012 to significantly above 50 percent for
the entire forecast period, the PV of debt-to revenue ratio from 157 percent to 246 percent, the PV
of debt to exports from 132 percent to 199 percent, and the debt service to revenue ratio from
5 percent to 18 percent over a number of years. Over time, however, all but the PV of debt to
exports measure improve as the one-off effects of the shocks dissipate. 4
12.

An “historical” scenario, which replicates the past performance of key economic

variables, yields debt ratios that are below the current baseline projections (Figure 1). Samoa
has historically had sound macroeconomic policies supported by an array of structural reforms that
had resulted in a period of sustained growth. However, there was a step down in output growth in
years just preceding the global crisis. The global crisis hit Samoa hard and the country suffered
another blow when a tsunami hit its tourism-oriented region.

4

Given the large and protracted breach of the PV of debt to GDP threshold, the consideration of Samoa’s large
remittances in the assessment would not be able to help reduce the moderate risk rating.

PUBLIC SECTOR DSA
13.

The public sector debt analysis supports the conclusions drawn from the external debt

analysis (Figure 2; Tables 2a and 2b). The nominal value of public sector debt stock is estimated
at 76 percent of GDP in FY2011 (62.8

percent of GDP in PV terms) and is
expected to rise to 80 percent of GDP (66
percent of GDP in PV terms) in the current
fiscal year. Scenario analysis shows that if
Samoa failed to undertake fiscal
consolidation, public sector debt would
keep growing over the entire forecast

end of the forecast period.

CONCLUSION AND STAFF ASSESSMENT
14.

Despite its reliance on concessional external borrowing and continued support from

development partners, Samoa is now faced with a moderate risk of debt distress. Because of
the slower-than-anticipated recovery and less favorable growth prospects, the underlying risk of
debt distress has moved upward. This DSA shows that while Samoa’s debt path is generally resilient
to shocks, it is very vulnerable to exchange rate shocks. Scenario analysis indicates that Samoa
would be even more vulnerable to such shocks should the country fail to reduce its fiscal deficit to a
more sustainable level over the medium term.
15.

Samoa’s challenges for maintaining a sustainable level of public debt have increased in

recent years. Achieving the growth and export projections in the baseline scenario would require
policies to maintain macroeconomic stability, continued investment in and maintenance of
infrastructure, and structural reforms to improve the investment climate and increase economic
efficiency, particularly that of public enterprises. Samoa would need to develop a credible deficit5

Public sector debt includes all external debt of the central government, including on-lent amounts, domestic debt
of the central government, defaulted loans of PEs, and PE current and non-current liabilities (excluding government
on-lending and inter-PE loans).

reduction plan over the medium term and further improve debt management to support fiscal
consolidation. Sustained efforts would be needed to rebuild policy buffers against future shocks.

AUTHORITIES' VIEWS
16.

The authorities recognize the risks posed by the high and rising debt burdens and are

committed to bringing them down to more sustainable levels. They agreed that it is critical to
formulate and implement a credible fiscal consolidation plan and to strengthen debt management
and undertake structural reforms to boost growth.

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Public Information Notice (PIN) No. 12/66
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
June 29, 2012

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation
with Samoa
On June 15, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Samoa.1
Background
The Samoan economy continues to recover, but the rebound has been weak. After
two consecutive years of contraction, real GDP expanded by 2.0 percent in 2010/11,
on account of fiscal and monetary stimulus as well as swift post-tsunami
reconstruction. However, growth slowed considerably in the last quarter of 2011, to
0.8 percent, and is expected to remain subdued for the rest of the year as
reconstruction activity continues to subside and the growth of external demand
remains moderate.
Inflation has been rising in recent months largely as a result of drought conditions in
late 2011 that have affected the supply of agricultural products. After peaking at
11.4 percent (4 percent excluding food) in December 2011, headline inflation fell
back to 6.7 percent in April and is expected to be around 6 percent by end-June.
The fiscal deficit has fallen to 6½ of GDP in 2010/11 after increasing to 7½ of GDP in
2009/10 to support post-tsunami reconstruction. The implementation of the 2011/12
budget is broadly on target, but supplementary appropriations will likely result in a
fiscal deficit of 6 percent of GDP, about ½ percent of GDP higher than originally
budgeted and slightly lower than the level achieved last year. Increased deficits have
been largely financed by external borrowings on concessional terms.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions
with members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and
financial information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments
and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the
basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the
Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive
Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of
any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2

The current account deficit has widened sharply over the past three years. This has
resulted from increased imports for post-tsunami reconstruction, rising world food
and fuel prices, and the slow recovery of remittances and tourism. As reconstruction
activity winds down, however, the current account deficit is expected to trend
downward (as percent of GDP). Foreign reserves have declined to about US$151
million (about 4.3 months of next year’s imports) at end March.
The Central Bank of Samoa has maintained an accommodative monetary policy to
support economic activity since the global financial crisis. Banking sector liquidity has
tightened considerably following recent dividend repatriation, outbound FDI, and
large one-off imports. Banks are generally well capitalized and profitable, but nonperforming loans are rising for some banks amid weak economic activity, particularly
in the tourism industry.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities’ management of the shocks arising
from the global financial crisis and the 2009 tsunami. They welcomed the continued
economic recovery but noted that growth is likely to remain moderate and is subject
to downside risks from global economic uncertainty. As a small island economy,
Samoa will also remain vulnerable to exogenous shocks. Against this backdrop,
Directors agreed that the focus should be on rebuilding fiscal and external buffers,
while supporting the recovery and fostering sustainable growth over the longer term.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to reduce the fiscal deficit, and
stressed that decisive actions are needed to achieve consolidation goals and bring
public debt to a more sustainable level. Given the fragile state of the recovery,
Directors considered that consolidation should be measured and steady in the short
run. They encouraged the authorities to restrain current expenditure and to prioritize
development and infrastructure projects. Directors called for a credible medium term
fiscal consolidation plan with a corresponding debt management strategy. They
emphasized the importance of monitoring closely the debt incurred by public
enterprises and minimizing fiscal risks.
Directors noted that the tala has appreciated substantially in real effective terms over
the past decade and is assessed to be overvalued. Most Directors considered that a
gradual realignment of the exchange rate could help prevent further reserve losses
and strengthen export competitiveness. A few Directors, however, were not
convinced of the benefits of such a move. Directors cautioned that the pace and
timing of a realignment would need to be carefully managed, with due consideration
to the potential impact on external debt and inflation. They stressed the need for
further analytical work, supported by Fund technical assistance, in this area.
Directors agreed that monetary policy could remain accommodative at the current
juncture given weak economic activity. The authorities should nevertheless be ready
to tighten monetary policy in the event of an exchange rate adjustment. Directors

3

called for continued efforts to strengthen financial sector supervision, in particular by
bringing the Unit Trust of Samoa under the oversight of the central bank.
Directors agreed that continued structural reforms would be vital to restoring
Samoa’s strong growth record. They encouraged the authorities to undertake bold
reforms, focusing on increasing the efficiency of public enterprises, further improving
public financial management, making customary land more accessible for productive
use, and deepening financial intermediation.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by Christopher Legg, Executive Director for Samoa and Christopher Becker, Advisor to
Executive Director
Jun 15, 2012
The Samoan economy continues to face substantial challenges in the post-Tsunami and world financial
crisis environment. Economic growth remains sluggish and the public debt that was accumulated in the
aftermath of the natural disaster has now exceeded its medium-term target of 50 percent of GDP. In this
context, we note the authorities’ full recognition of the policy challenges that lie ahead and their plans to
address the need for fiscal consolidation. These plans were already well progressed but further benefited
from Staff input during the recent Article IV mission. The Samoan authorities welcomed the Staff
assessment and advice, and attach particular importance to obtaining the technical assistance highlighted
in the Staff Report to facilitate implementation of key Fund recommendations. The authorities also want
to express their appreciation for the frank, constructive, and collegiate approach to the discussions
adopted by Staff.
1. Exchange rate and monetary policy
The Central Bank of Samoa has lowered interest rates to near zero in an attempt to stimulate the economy.
However, pass-through is constrained by the commercial banks’ concern about risk following the
recession, and is hindered by an underdeveloped financial market where there is a lagged and only loose
link between the policy rate, bank funding costs, and lending rates. As a result, there is only a very small
fillip to growth from monetary policy. Commercial banks continue to be deposit funded and set lending
rates as a fixed, risk-based, markup on their administratively determined funding costs. Lending rates
have therefore not fallen by anywhere near as much as the policy rate, or indeed deposit rates.
The real exchange rate has appreciated, principally as a result of two significant import price shocks that
fed directly into domestic inflation. As a result, there has been a loss of international competitiveness in
the tourism and agricultural sectors. The Staff exchange rate assessment indicates an overvaluation of the
real effective exchange rate in the order of 10 to 25 percent.
Should economic conditions deteriorate substantially, the authorities are open to the Staff
recommendation to implement a gradual devaluation but remain apprehensive about the timing and
practicalities of doing so, and attach particular importance to obtaining technical assistance (as agreed
with the Fund) which would be necessary to help work through the many implementation issues involved.
These include the preponderance of foreign currency denominated external debt, the continued heavy
reliance on imports, and the challenges posed for monetary policy by the associated recommendation that
monetary policy should be tightened to head off any resulting upward pressure on inflation. (It is
concerning to contemplate how much interest rates might have to rise to create a sufficient domestic
output gap in order to lower domestic prices enough to offset the much more important increase in
imported inflation, given the limited effectiveness of the transmission mechanism noted earlier. The use
of statutory reserve deposits to influence lending rates might be an option.)
Our authorities therefore look to the Fund to follow through in facilitating the technical assistance needed
to ensure its advice can be implemented. It will be particularly important to consider the composition of
the devaluation among the currencies in the basket to which Samoa pegs.

For instance, it might be possible to engineer a larger devaluation against the currencies that represent the
main sources of tourism and other exports, while limiting the devaluation against the currencies in which
the majority of external debt is denominated.
It is well understood that addressing a potential overvaluation in the exchange rate will also be important
to prevent the depletion of foreign exchange reserves, which could eventually force the central bank to
devalue the exchange rate in a manner that might be more disruptive.
2. Macroeconomic conditions
The economy grew by just 2.0 percent in 2010/11 and is expected to post GDP growth of 1.5 percent in
2011/12. Lack of competitiveness as a result of the real exchange rate appreciation could well be a key
reason for the more sluggish performance in recent years. More indirectly, the sharp appreciation of the
Australian and, to a lesser extent, the New Zealand dollar against the US and euro area currencies are
probably responsible for diverting many of the traditional tourists destined for Samoa to the United States
and Europe. Furthermore, consumers have shown a general tendency to spend less and save more in
developed economies like Australia.
Progress has been made on tackling the issue of land ownership. About 85 percent of land is subject to
traditional/communal entitlements, which means that basic property rights are not well defined.
Commercial banks are unwilling to lend against traditional land or for housing built on that land. As a
result, the government continues to consult widely with land owners and financial institutions in an effort
to come up with a framework whereby the lease of customary land can be accepted as collateral for
commercial investment.
In line with sluggish domestic economic growth, inflation remains relatively subdued and does not
threaten to destabilize the macroeconomic prospects of the country. However, given the high dependence
on imports, especially of food and fuel, the inflation outlook remains subject to the possibility of adverse
shocks that quickly feed into the domestic price level.
3. Fiscal policy and public sector indebtedness
The authorities recognize the need for fiscal consolidation in order to achieve a more favorable debt
position that also builds the appropriate buffers to allow scope for fiscal policy to absorb potential future
shocks.
Bringing the budget deficit down from around 6.5 percent of GDP this year to the recommended
benchmark will require a sustained effort and a significant commitment to build public consensus.
Infrastructure needs and further development will need to be carefully prioritized to ensure that fiscal
policy does not place an undue burden on the fragile recovery and that, within the constraints, as many
social projects are maintained as possible
Public indebtedness is expected to peak in coming years before gradually declining. The consolidation
task is considerable and authorities recognize the need to remain austere for many years to achieve a more
sustainable level of debt. One of the issues is that much of the donor support comes in the form of soft
loans, which while assisting in the development of local infrastructure, nonetheless adds to the existing
debt burden. Again, prioritization of competing donor projects will be important to ensure Samoa gets the
maximum benefits without unduly constraining its ability to deploy fiscal policy when needed.

Nevertheless, since most of the debt has been incurred on concessional terms, the servicing burden is
relatively benign.
There are some issues concerning the effective coordination of spending and debt management which the
authorities are addressing.
4. Financial sector issues
The government has recently set up a new unit trust which has several purposes. Unit Trust of Samoa
(UTOS) is open to deposits from residents and would allow Samoans access to a broader and more
diversified investment portfolio than simple bank deposits. The deposits would be channeled into
domestic investments and, eventually, into overseas assets. Matching Samoan savers with Samoan
investors is seen as a worthwhile policy objective which also provides competition to the highly
concentrated banking sector dominated by two foreign banks. The deposits taken by UTOS are currently
guaranteed by the government for the initial 5 year period.
The trust is currently not subject to prudential supervision but is guided by directives from the Ministry of
Finance. The authorities are still working on how this new financial institution is best integrated with the
rest of the financial system and expect it to evolve over time.
