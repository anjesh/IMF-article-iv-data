Executive Summary
The recovery is well under way with domestic demand as key driver and downside risks centered
on external factors. Crucial reforms have been proceeding (notably of pension and health care
systems), but changes in labor market institutions and work incentives have been harder to come
by, held back by “social cohesion” concerns. In the staff’s view, such changes need to be an
integral part of the authorities’ stated emphasis on growth-enhancing reforms if these are to
succeed in securing fiscal sustainability. Until such reforms are in hand, direct expenditure
restraint should aim at achieving a small structural surplus by the end of the decade. The
Financial System Stability Assessment found no systemic risks. It urged a further strengthening of
supervision and the phasing-out of state interventions in financial markets.
The strength of the current recovery has surprised, removing any cyclical concerns about
proceeding with much-needed fiscal adjustment. There was consensus that GDP growth would
average about 2.5 percent per year in 2004 and 2005. The authorities emphasized the need to
sustain confidence in the recovery, in part by supporting incomes at the lower end of the income
distribution and adopting a measured approach to fiscal adjustment. With the upswing in
domestic demand sufficiently well-established and downside risks mainly from the external side,
staff saw no need for supportive measures and room for greater structural fiscal adjustment.
Long-term growth is being fettered by structural weaknesses and adverse demographics,
requiring comprehensive structural reforms. While progress is being made in several areas,
labor market reform has reached an impasse. Reliance on budgetary measures to promote higher
labor utilization stands in direct conflict with fiscal consolidation objectives. Meanwhile, the
needed fundamental rethinking of labor market institutions has been left to reluctant social
partners and entitlement reform is largely off limits.
The authorities intend to reduce the fiscal deficit to under 3 percent of GDP in 2005 and to
rely on growth-enhancing reforms for long-term fiscal sustainability. Under current growth
prospects, the overall deficit is likely to fall to less than 3 percent of GDP in 2005. The
underlying structural adjustment implied by the official target is thus small while the pace of
medium-term consolidation is unclear. In the staff’s view, while pension and health care reforms
have been beneficial, there is a need to step up reforms of employment protection and benefits to
meaningfully increase labor utilization while securing structural fiscal adjustment. Until such
reforms are in hand, direct expenditure restraint should aim at achieving a small structural surplus
by the end of this decade before higher costs of aging kick in. The fiscal framework should be
strengthened and automatic stabilizers should be allowed full play, in contrast to a new fiscal rule
currently under consideration.
Ongoing product market deregulation, including simplification of administrative procedures,
liberalization of network industries, and an acceleration of divestiture has raised the potential
returns to increased labor market flexibility and growth prospects. The financial system was
found to be resilient, but continued vigilance with respect to banks’ risk exposure and further
strengthening of supervision and phasing out of state intervention in financial markets were
deemed necessary. The staff urged France to associate itself fully with efforts to bring the
Doha round to a successful conclusion and welcomed the relatively high level of official
development assistance (ODA).

-4-

I. BACKGROUND
1.
The cyclical recovery is well under way, but structural weaknesses and adverse
demographics inhibit long-term growth. Triggered by foreign demand in mid-2003, the
rebound in activity is now firmly led by private domestic spending, reflecting, inter alia,
supportive policy conditions and the unwinding of a household savings overhang. Beyond
the cyclical recovery, growth is impeded by structural factors, such as a high tax burden,
adverse demographics, and low productivity growth. Moreover, fiscal sustainability is not yet
secured, owing to a high structural deficit, rising dependency ratios, and increasing public
spending on health care and labor market policies.
2.
Policies have had mixed results in achieving the intertwined objectives of fiscal
sustainability and higher long-term growth, in part owing to concerns about social
cohesion (Box 1). Key reforms of the pension and health care systems have been tackled and
steady advances are being made in product markets. However, rigid labor markets stand in
the way of reaping full benefits from the latter and prevent higher labor utilization from
translating into fiscal consolidation. Indeed, measures to promote labor supply and demand—
while having contributed to a positive record on employment—are weighing heavily on the
budget. This is particularly the case for those measures taken to mitigate the adverse
consequences on labor costs and supply of the implementation of the reduction in the
workweek. The gradual approach to reform reflects a tension between widely held
recognition of the need for change and equally widely spread concern that the associated
retreat of the state would place low- and middle-income citizens at a disadvantage. This
tension was evident in discussions of the mission with social partners, with labor unions
indicating that reforms (and the adoption of Fund advice) would raise social exclusion and
inequity, and employers noting that high labor costs and regulatory burdens put them at a
competitive disadvantage.
II. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
3.
The discussions focused on the outlook and where to strike the balance between
up-front fiscal adjustment and structural reforms in the pursuit of fiscal sustainability.
With the authorities perceiving confidence as still fragile, they favored a strategy of
continued support to consumers, measured fiscal adjustment, and selected labor and product
market reforms. For fiscal sustainability, they emphasized growth-enhancing structural
reforms with moderate up-front consolidation. The staff saw a need for deeper reforms,
especially in the labor market.1 As such reforms were not in the offing, it argued for a
heightened focus on fiscal adjustment.

1

The mission provided its views to a commission chaired by Mr. Camdessus and charged with identifying the
structural impediments to growth in France.

-5-

Box 1. Past Fund Policy Recommendations and Implementation
Successive governments have concurred broadly with the direction of the Fund’s economic
policy advice but have underscored the importance of social cohesion, expressed in generous
welfare arrangements and a narrow income distribution. Policies have been marked by the
tension between this focus and the concomitant quest for fiscal discipline and higher long-term
growth, resulting in a gradual approach to reform. The dialogue with staff on these issues has
been traditionally open and frank.
Fiscal policy: The Fund’s long-standing advice to consolidate at an annual average pace of
0.5 percent of GDP until structural balance or surplus is achieved was not followed during
2000–03. Tax cuts induced by an overestimation of the strength of structural revenues and
expenditure overruns increased the structural deficit. In line with Fund advice, pension reform
has appreciably diminished the projected cost of aging and health care reform is making
inroads, but civil service reform is yet to start in earnest. The authorities do not see room for
sizeable expenditure cuts that would permit a much-needed early reduction in the tax burden.
Labor and product markets: The Fund has called for increasing flexibility in labor markets,
especially in the context of the reduction of the workweek to 35 hours. The attendant increase
in labor costs is being mitigated by cuts in social security contributions and improved labor
organization, allowing more people to find jobs, but the overall net effect on potential output is
negative while the costs to the budget are high. In line with Fund advice, additional flexibility
was introduced, especially for smaller firms. Reform of labor market institutions and
entitlements (other than pensions) remains to be tackled. In product markets, divestiture and
deregulation are ongoing, albeit at a slower pace than advised by the Fund.
Financial sector: In line with Fund advice, the financial sector has been subject to strong
supervision. The authorities have been reluctant to phase out widespread administrative
interventions in financial markets, but some saving schemes have become more marketoriented.
Trade policy: The Fund has called on France to help advance trade liberalization, partly
through a reform of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). Though the authorities agree in
principle, and CAP reform is to be implemented in 2007, they have publicly voiced strong
reservations about recent proposals, which they see as unbalanced.

A. Economic Performance and Near-Term Outlook and Policies
4.
Domestic demand has become the engine of growth. Following a weak first half
of 2003 marred by geopolitical uncertainties, rising unemployment, faltering income growth,
sticky downward adjustment of domestic retail interest rates and low overall confidence, a
rebound in exports in mid-2003 initiated the

income of the cash-constrained; the
suspension of a tax on productive assets for
new investments (the taxe professionnelle) helped investor confidence; and several minor
fiscal measures taken in 2004 supported household consumption (e.g., an interest deduction
for consumer credits, a suspension of a tax on wealth transfers to the younger generation, and
an agreement with the distribution sector to decrease prices on brand name products to break
higher-than-actual inflation perceptions).3 In the authorities’ view, these policies had paid off
in the form of a relatively early and robust recovery compared to other large euro-area
economies.
5.
The strength of private consumption was seen as reflecting both fundamental
and exceptional factors (Figure 2 and Box 2). During the initial phases of the downturn,
household saving had, somewhat paradoxically, continued to rise, despite a decline in real

disposable income as a result of job losses,
moderate wage increases, lower nonwage
income, and higher energy and food prices.
There was consensus that wealth effects were
weak in France while higher-than-actual
price perceptions and low confidence had
delayed spending. Consequently, when the
economy turned, this backlog of
consumption began to unwind. Declining
real interest rates also buttressed the rise in
the propensity to consume. The authorities
stressed that exceptional factors—subnormal
temperatures, extended sales, and higher outof-pocket medical expenses—boosted
household consumption in the first quarter
of 2004 and saw a need to sustain it, while
staff saw somewhat greater underlying
strength, subsequently confirmed by second
quarter data.
6.
Fixed investment is benefiting from
a catch-up. As noted at the time of the
2003 Article IV Consultation, business
investment had been weaker than expected
during the downturn, with replacement
investment being postponed (Figure 3). Partly
because of accounting scandals, which had
raised perceptions of heightened balance-sheet
risk, companies were strengthening selffinancing capacity, prompting widespread
deleveraging. With presently healthier balance
sheets, improved demand prospects, and
equity markets well off their post-bubble lows,
corporate investment is rebounding strongly.
Residential construction has moved up,
reflecting several years of sustained real house
price increases and low interest rates.

Employment held up better than in
previous downswings, especially initially, and the rise in unemployment appears to have
ended already in early 2004, helped by a slowing of labor supply growth (Figure 4).
Payrolls fell modestly in 2003 as cyclical and secular layoffs in industry exceeded the
services sector’s capacity to create jobs. The end of the adoption of the shorter workweek and
the phasing-out of some public employment programs also played a role.

-8-

Box 2: Household Consumption: is its Recent Strength Enduring?
Following a sharp increase during the 1990s
and the initial phase of the recent cyclical
downturn, the conventionally-measured
household savings rate has dropped sharply
since mid-2003, raising the question of the
sustainability of the rebound in private
consumption.

Perceptions of stronger-than-reported inflation,
uncertainties surrounding social security
reforms, and poor employment prospects
appear to have restrained spending through
most of 2003. These factors opened a gap
between long-term equilibrium and actual
consumption. The first one, as reported in
surveys, has been attributed to sharp price
increases in some highly visible consumption
goods and services after the introduction of
euro notes and coins. With the wedge between
measured and perceived inflation no longer
widening, pension and health care reforms
clarified, and economic recovery under way,
the current strength of household consumption
(abstracting from the exceptional factors in
early 2004) is not too surprising. In addition,
income support and wage increases at the
bottom of the income distribution are likely to
have temporarily elevated the propensity to
consume.

be lower than it could be because of incomplete
financial markets which limit the possibility of
converting gains in nonfinancial wealth into liquidity. Indeed, the secular increase of French
household savings in the 1990s contrasts sharply with the observed decline in other countries,
attributed to gains in wealth of which France also benefited.
Staff analysis, using aggregate time series econometrics, confirms that consumption (of
nondurables) tracks real disposable income closely in France, but that wealth effects matter as well
(see Selected Issues paper). The latter are, however, smaller than in the United States, and the
impact of nonfinancial assets (housing) remains uncertain. These results are compatible with
strong risk aversion of households and incomplete financial markets. Consequently, while the
outlook for consumption remains bright, there is also a role for policies to improve the working of
consumer and mortgage credit markets and strengthen confidence through growth-oriented
structural reforms.

Figure 5. Labor Intensity of Output
1.01

Conversely, labor hoarding and wage moderation
contributed to a higher labor intensity of output,
particularly during the initial phase of the downswing
(Figure 5). Targeted cuts in social security contributions
helped sustain employment, resulting in a substitution of
low-skilled labor for capital and high-skilled workers,
and in a slowdown in measured labor productivity
growth. Consequently, unemployment increased less
rapidly than in the past, helped also by diminishing labor
supply growth owing to demographics and early
retirements.
8.
There was agreement that the recovery was well
under way with downside risks centered on external
factors. The authorities concurred that growth would be
close to 2.5 percent in 2004, significantly higher than the
1.7 percent underlying the 2004 budget––but new official
forecasts will not be available until the fall. Risks to the
outlook seemed balanced between external factors on the
downside (oil prices, the euro, and demand in the rest of
the euro area) and domestic factors on the upside (mainly
private consumption). It was noted that the direct effect of
higher oil prices would be dampened somewhat by
France’s high reliance on nuclear power, but that indirect
effects through slower partner country growth could be
significant. Similarly, further euro appreciation and
weaker-than-envisaged domestic demand in Germany and
Italy could adversely affect growth. On the other hand,
house prices were not considered a key risk as their
wealth effects were small (Box 2); recent price increases
were seen to be largely driven by fundamentals; and
household indebtedness was low by international
standards. In addition, with household savings still high,
private consumption could surprise on the upside,
especially if employment prospects improved more
rapidly. Since the mission, some elements of both upand downside risks have materialized: domestic demand
has been stronger than expected, while oil prices have
been much higher. The staff projects GDP growth of
2.6 percent in 2004, in line with confidence indicators
(Figures 6 and 7) and 2.3 percent in 2005.

The current account surplus is
projected to turn into deficit in the near term,
partly for cyclical reasons. There was consensus
that the cumulated effect of euro appreciation,
though not of major concern, had been leaving its
mark on the external accounts, especially via
tourism. Export performance had recently been
comparatively weak (Figure 8), owing to the real
appreciation of the exchange rate vis-à-vis other
EU countries and structural factors, in particular
the pattern of regional trade (with the high weight
of Germany where domestic demand remained
weak) and product specialization (e.g., the airline
industry, affected by geopolitical turmoil). In the
near term, with domestic demand running ahead
of that of major euro-area trading partners, the
trade balance and current account are projected to
move into a deficit.

The staff nonetheless sees the latter retreating to less than 2 percent in the course of 2005. As
emphasized by the authorities, it will be important to avoid second-round effects from energy
and regulated price hikes.

The authorities agreed that monetary conditions were supportive and that a
closer link between administered and market interest rates would facilitate monetary
transmission. The decline in real interest rates had offset most of the impact of the euro’s
appreciation (Figure 11). Short-term real interest rates were close to zero, and long-term rates
appeared consistent with growth at potential rates. Nonetheless, the staff observed that
domestic retail interest rates had adjusted very slowly to reductions in the ECB’s policy rates,
owing to administrative interventions in financial markets. Consequently, during the recent
easing cycle, this sluggishness was estimated to have caused consumption to be lower by
1.7 percentage points compared to the counterfactual of immediate pass-through (see
Selected Issues paper). It was agreed that the new interest rate adjustment mechanism in
place since mid-2003 would strengthen the response of domestic interest rates,4 though the
authorities recognized that it still did not render it instantaneous and did not apply to all
administered rates. While generally disposed toward closer alignment of administered and
market rates, the authorities were not inclined to phase out administered savings schemes in
the near term, inter alia pointing to their use to finance social housing.
12.
With growth exceeding expectations, staff stressed that a resumption of fiscal
consolidation would not threaten the recovery. In 2003, against the weak economic
environment, the fiscal stance had been supportive, as automatic stabilizers had been allowed
to play fully, and no structural adjustment took place. As a result, the deficit widened from
3.3 percent of GDP in 2002 to 4.1 percent of GDP in 2003. For 2004–05, the fiscal stance
was set to be moderately restrictive. The staff noted that the fiscal measures implemented in
early 2004 to boost consumption seemed unnecessary, but agreed that they had been
confidence-enhancing and would have virtually no impact on the budget.

4

In mid-2003, some administered interest rates were adjusted downward toward prevailing market rates and a
new formula adopted that would lead to their automatic six-monthly adjustment, though potentially only for half
of the change, given the 50-percent weight of inflation, and with inflation as a floor.

B. Fiscal Consolidation Strategy

Concerned with rising public debt, the

adjustment (Figure 12). They agreed that
without adjustment, the debt ratio was vulnerable
to significant increases over the next five years,

especially if growth faltered, as brought out by

could allow the nominal 2004 budget deficit

the envisaged structural adjustment will be lower

than originally targeted (0.6 instead of some

government level, freezing credits and

But slippages continue in health care, and the
delay in lowering the duration of unemployment
benefits will also weigh on the budget.5 Nonetheless, spending is falling as a share of GDP,
in part due to higher-than-projected inflation (Text Table 1). There was agreement that all
revenue windfalls from higher nominal growth in 2004 should be fully saved. Furthermore,
the authorities saw scope to reduce gross debt through divestiture and sold part of their stake
in France Télécom in September.

14.
The authorities’ principal near-term objectives are to reduce the overall deficit
to less than 3 percent of GDP in 2005 and to 2.5 percent of GDP in 2006, which on
current projections implies only a modest structural adjustment. Though no final
decisions had been made, the authorities generally agreed that there was no room for new tax
cuts over this horizon. They also felt that it would be difficult to reach these budget
objectives without higher-than-anticipated growth or the help of one-off factors, such as the
transfer of pension funds from the public utilities. Keeping central government spending
constant in real terms would not suffice to cover the start-up costs of health care reforms,
while the reforms might not succeed in reducing the health system’s deficit as much as
planned (¶18). In the event, growth now looks stronger than envisaged, bringing the nominal
targets within reach without other measures. However, achieving them would represent a
cumulative structural adjustment of only about 0.5 percentage points of GDP over 2005–06.
Consequently, the staff called for more ambitious consolidation (¶16). A supplement to this
report covering the 2005 budget will revisit these issues.

Starting in January 2004, social partners had agreed to reduce unemployment benefit duration on average by
about 7 months, but the High Justice Court ruled that this measure could not apply to those that were
unemployed at the time of the decision.

1/ Staff projections are based on the authorities' 2004 budget, plans for freezing central government level spending, health
care reform, and cuts in social security contributions, adjusted for the staff's macroeconomic assumptions and judgment on social
security spending.
2/ Through upfront fiscal consolidation, this scenario allows growing pension spending over the next 50 years to be offset
by lower interest payments due to the declining public debt burden. Sustainability is defined as the public debt-to-GDP ratio
stabilizing at the same horizon as the dependency ratio.
3/ Same as in footnote 2 but with structural reforms raising the employment rate to 70 percent by 2010. The public
debt-to-GDP ratio stabilizes at a higher level, requiring less fiscal consolidation.

15.
The emphasis of the authorities’ long-run fiscal consolidation strategy appears to
have shifted away from medium-term budget balance and toward growth-enhancing
structural reforms. While the latest Stability Program update (December 2003) aimed for a
near structural balance by 2007, in this year’s preparatory document for the 2005 budget, the
authorities argued that the fiscal consequences of aging should be dealt with mainly through
reforms (about two-thirds), but less (the remaining one-third) through direct fiscal
adjustment. Assuming successful pension and health care reform—which had been
completed—and further to-be-identified structural reforms, the document presented as
sustainable a scenario based on a long-term average structural deficit of about 1 percent of
GDP. The authorities underscored that this however required a considerable adjustment from
the present structural deficit, estimated at about 2.5–3.0 percent of GDP. In setting
compliance targets under the Stability and Growth Pact, whose usefulness they stressed, they
argued against a “one-size-fits-all approach” (represented by the close-to-balance rule) and in
favor of taking into account country-specific circumstances, such as the initial level of public
debt and the remaining unfunded costs of aging.

- 17 -

16.
The staff supported the emphasis on growth-enhancing structural reforms, but
stressed that the current reform agenda would need to be strengthened appreciably to
meet the challenge and that direct fiscal consolidation would also need to contribute. To
illustrate the magnitude of the challenge, assuming that current structural reforms are on
track to lower the NAIRU to 7 percent in the next 5 years6, fiscal sustainability through upfront adjustment would require an overall structural surplus of 0.7 percent of GDP by 2008,
2.2 percentage points more than under current policies (Figures 13 and 14 and Text
Table 1).7 A decisive reform strategy that would raise the employment rate from
63.4 percent8 in 2003 to 70 percent by 2010, significantly reduces, but does not eliminate, the
need for up-front fiscal adjustment. It requires lowering the structural deficit to about
0.5 percent of GDP by 2008, implying additional adjustment of 1 percentage point compared
to current policies.9 Such an ambitious reform strategy, while highly desirable in the staff’s
view, is, however, not currently on the agenda. Consequently, until it is, the staff saw a need
for sustained expenditure-based adjustment at a pace somewhat more than three-quarters of
one percent of GDP per year until a small structural surplus is achieved. However, given the
high tax burden, as future structural reforms are implemented and pay off in terms of higher
long-term growth, further growth-enhancing tax cuts should be moved up on the agenda.
Such a move could be considered when a small, enduring structural surplus is achieved.
17.
Progress on structural adjustment will require breaking the pernicious link
between the budget and labor market policies. The authorities had become well aware of
the high budgetary cost of their active labor market policies (mostly cuts in social security
contributions and to a lesser extent the earned income tax credit—together estimated to
amount to 1 percent of GDP by 2005). These policies had been instituted to offset the
adverse consequences on labor costs and employment of high and rising minimum wages, the
mandatory 35-hour workweek, and high marginal tax and benefit replacement rates. This
circle was set to take another vicious turn in 2005 with a large step increase in the minimum
wage (SMIC) (3.8 percent in real terms), accompanied by partly offsetting cuts in social
security contributions.10

6

The staff estimates that effects of past wage moderation and ongoing reforms would suffice to achieve this
objective.

7

Fiscal sustainability is defined as a constant public debt-to-GDP ratio at the time the dependency ratio
stabilizes and costs of aging no longer increase as a share of GDP.

8

OECD data based on 15–64 age group.

9

In this reform scenario general government real spending can grow at 0.8 percent per year during 2005–08,
compared to current plans of 1.3 percent per year. Without reforms, spending growth needs to be compressed to
0.2 percent per year.

10

This increase is the last step in the harmonization of the multiple monthly minimum wages that emerged from
the phased adoption of the 35-hour workweek.

To mitigate the budgetary impact of these policies, the authorities were considering various
options: (i) spreading the minimum wage increases over time; (ii) narrowing the salary range
over which social security contributions are reduced (it currently reaches up to 1.7 times the
SMIC); (iii) reducing the upper income limit of the earned income tax credit; and
(iv) reforming the workweek restrictions and employment protection.11 However, at the same
time, a new “social cohesion” plan had been announced at significant budgetary cost and
with uncertain implications for labor market performance (¶25). The staff urged the
authorities to fund this plan out of existing resources and to focus on reforming employment
protection and entitlements, which would have large benefits in terms of employment and
possibly positive effects on the budget.

There was consensus that effective health care, pension and civil service reforms
and well thought-out decentralization would be key avenues for fiscal consolidation:

included widening coverage, increasing
tariffs of consultations, escalating prices of
pharmaceuticals, mounting personnel costs
due to the workweek reduction, and rising
service volumes related to technological

Following several piecemeal measures, a
comprehensive health care reform was approved in mid-2004 with the aim of balancing
the books by 2007, while increasing quality and preserving equal access. The reform
introduces the possibility to modulate all key parameters governing the behavior of patients,
medical professionals, and insurance agents. The initial values of the parameters chosen,
together with measures taken to raise revenues, are officially estimated to yield budgetary
savings of about €15 billion in 2007, equivalent to the ministry of health’s projection of the
deficit before measures:

The measures appear insufficient to eliminate the projected budget deficit, which itself
may be underestimated. The impact of expenditure control measures is highly uncertain,
transfers from the state do not lower the general government deficit, and the higher costs of
operating an improved administration of the health care system have not been taken into
account. Moreover, the system’s trend deficit before measures is projected by the health
insurance agency (CNAM) to reach €23 billion by 2007.

parameters to influence behavior of patients, providers, and insurance agencies and
the revenues of the system. Nonetheless, there was a general perception that the initial
parameters chosen were too timid to ensure the stated objective of a return to balance
of the health system’s budget by 2007, though it was agreed that estimating the
budgetary impact of measures designed to affect behaviors was difficult.
•

The 1993 and 2003 pension reforms have brought the projected costs of aging in
France to well below the euro-area average and established regular five-year reviews
to secure the system’s sustainability.12 While these reforms need to mature before
considering further changes, the staff argued for phasing out early retirement schemes
and reducing the generosity of some special retirement regimes, particularly when
funded by the taxpayer.

•

The nonreplacement of retiring civil servants had so far been used only symbolically,
far short of the guideline that on average only one out of two positions should be
retained.13 With personnel expenses topping 40 percent of the budget envelope
(Table 4), the authorities agreed that more efforts were needed in this area, but
political appetite was lacking.

•

The authorities saw decentralization as an opportunity to better tailor public services
to local needs and achieve efficiency gains, particularly in the areas of education,
infrastructure, and social programs. Acknowledging the merits of such an approach,
staff urged the authorities to allow sufficient fiscal autonomy and own resources to
local governments so as to induce them to improve spending efficiency. To this end,
staff suggested the introduction of a local surcharge on either the personal income tax
or the general social security contribution (CSG), but the authorities felt that
implementation difficulties would offset potential gains.

19.
The authorities were examining the scope for closing tax niches, but in the
absence of room for tax cuts were reluctant to make wholesale changes to the tax
structure. They nonetheless felt the need to remove the taxe professionnelle (TP)—a highly
distortionary tax on capital that had been suspended in January 2004, initially for 18 months
and now through end-2005—but found it difficult to identify workable alternatives. This tax
is a major source of financing for local governments and is seen to establish a politically
important link between industry location and local tax revenues. The staff argued that more
reliance on charges and fees for services provided to enterprises, as well as households,
should be considered. The mission’s call for higher real estate taxes and the abolition of

With pensions indexed to inflation, projected replacement rates are low. In addition, new private pension
savings vehicles (e.g., PERP) were introduced in 2004.

- 21 -

preferential VAT rates14 to replace some of the TP along with a local surcharge on income
taxes were met with little enthusiasm.
20.
The authorities recognized that preserving cyclical revenue windfalls would be
key to fiscal consolidation, but their proposed rule fell short of full operation of
automatic stabilizers. Mindful of previous episodes when cyclical windfalls had given rise
to permanent tax cuts (e.g., the “cagnotte” episode in 2000), the authorities were seeking to
enshrine in law a mechanism that would avoid such events. Their proposal would earmark at
least (authorities’ emphasis) two-thirds of higher-than-budgeted revenues for deficit
reduction, and limit use of the remainder to temporary tax cuts or investment spending, and
only in the year following the windfall. The staff advocated full play of automatic stabilizers
and noted that the authorities’ proposed rule was asymmetrical and procyclical, which in
other countries (e.g., the Netherlands) had given rise to structural slippage. The authorities
responded that the staff proposal left policy-makers with no room for maneuver and would
not be politically enforceable. Their simulations showed that application of the rule even with
permanent tax cuts or spending increases would lead to a structural budget deterioration over
a typical cycle of only about 0.1 percentage point of GDP per year. Moreover, they stressed
that no windfalls would be spent in 2004 and, more generally, until the deficit fell below an
acceptable threshold. The staff welcomed this intention—which it felt would need to be
adhered to well beyond 2004—and questioned the political feasibility of “temporary” tax
cuts or spending increases as envisaged under the authorities’ proposed rule.
21.
Other measures were under way or under consideration to strengthen the fiscal
framework. The new budget law would be fully applied in 2006 requiring zero-base
budgeting and multi-year programming for spending agents. The preparation of its
implementation was already improving spending control at the central government level,
including through early interministerial coordination. The budget law would also promote
using spending ceilings in terms of levels. A multiyear budgeting approach for social security
and an internal stability pact with local authorities are under consideration. The authorities
saw merit in the staff proposal to establish an independent agency to conduct forwardlooking budget assessments. The staff also called for a higher frequency of publication of
government accounts, including by sub-levels, to improve transparency and accountability.
C. Labor and Product Markets
22.
There was agreement that labor and product market reforms were needed to lift
potential growth prospects. Key weaknesses lie in low participation and employment rates
and declining numbers of hours worked. Moreover, adverse demographics would soon
reduce the labor force, and total factor productivity growth had declined, though this was
seen as a likely transitory phenomenon while low-productivity workers were being absorbed
14

The base for real estate taxes has not kept up with increases in house prices and the use of preferential VAT
rates is an inefficient way of achieving social objectives (see “Tax Reform and Potential Growth in France”, in
Country Report 03/335).

- 22 -

in the labor force. High minimum wages were pricing the low-skilled out of employment,
and high replacement income reduced labor supply, both requiring costly budgetary
intervention to mitigate adverse effects on employment. In turn, high public expenditure
perpetuated the heavy tax burden with likely negative implications for potential growth.
23.
The staff pressed for comprehensive
reform of labor market institutions to raise
the labor utilization rate. It argued for
reshaping the employment protection system
to clarify the role of the judiciary and reduce
firing costs15 and a reorientation of the
entitlement system toward encouraging job
search. Indexation of benefits and minimum
wages should henceforth be linked to
underlying inflation and not to wages and the
duration of benefits could be further
shortened. Regarding active labor market
policies, staff encouraged measures that
emphasized training, especially on the job,
and facilitated the hiring of low-skilled youth
(Box 4). It also underscored that product
market deregulation had raised the potential
returns from increased labor market flexibility
but that, aside from wage moderation, labor
market rigidities appeared to have increased in
the 1990s (Figure 15).

The labor market policy indicator covers employment

product market reform indicator covers product market reforms
over the 1975–98 period in the nonmanufacturing sector (see
Chapter IV in the April 2003 World Economic Outlook for
details).

24.
The authorities responded that
several of the staff’s suggested labor
market reforms were under way or under consideration, but saw the lowering of
benefits and replacement rates as running counter to the government’s emphasis on
social solidarity. In addition, they stressed that recent increases in benefits and minimum
wages had helped sustain confidence and household consumption. They had also extended
the possibility for social partners to negotiate derogations from the strictures of the 35-hour
workweek—which so far has been used only marginally—and allowed for the establishment
of private employment agencies. They agreed that cumbersome labor laws and excessive
court involvement in layoffs offered “employment protection” in the short run, but ultimately

15

Well-publicized studies by Blanchard and Tirole suggest replacing all existing forms of employment
protection with a simple layoff tax, while greatly simplifying the judicial process. The authorities considered
this proposal interesting but at odds with the country’s mainstream thinking and, consequently, unlikely to be
considered in the near future.

Box 4. Youth Unemployment, Job Mobility, and Wage Growth
Over the last decade, similar average unemployment rates in France and Germany have
masked large differences in youth unemployment. While the latter matched the average in
Germany, in France it has been about twice as high (Figure).
Economic theory does not unequivocally
predict the role of early labor market
experiences for long-term wage and
employment prospects. High youth
unemployment rates reflecting excessive
job mobility may prevent on-the-job
training as human capital theory suggests
that experience accumulation depends on
the amount of time spent working.
Conversely, high job mobility of the
young may not be a problem if it reflects
search for better employment
opportunities. However, high
unemployment does not necessarily imply
high mobility.

Staff analysis suggests that youth in France are not in a beneficial search-induced highmobility equilibrium and that returns to on-the-job experience are lower in France (see
Selected Issues paper). In fact, job mobility and its contribution to wage growth are similar in
both Germany and France. From a decomposition of wage growth in “on-the-job” and
“between-jobs” wage growth, it appears that “between-jobs” growth contributes similarly to
the wage growth of young workers in both countries. Moreover, differences in the amount of
time spent working due to different unemployment spells are insufficient to explain lower onthe-job wage growth in France. Consequently, lower returns to experience seem a likely, if
partial, culprit. One implication is that on-the-job experience appears to be an imperfect
substitute for explicit training. A comparison of hourly wage profiles suggests that workers
with vocational and intermediate level of education might be undertrained in France compared
to Germany. For these workers, more explicit training arrangements may be beneficial,
provided their cost is shared between the worker and the employer. Recent measures to
promote training contain elements that move in this direction.

reduced labor demand by making firing decisions costly and uncertain. For the time being,
they had deferred the initiative for modifications in this area to social partners, which seemed
however reluctant to take up negotiations in earnest. The staff acknowledged that several of
these measures were beneficial, while emphasizing that increases in benefits and minimum
wages would have adverse long-term effects on labor market performance.
25.
The staff was critical of the new “social cohesion” program. While the plan is
commendable in its striving for reduced welfare dependency and exclusion, it falls back into

- 24 -

the trap of using fiscal resources to promote employment, initially outside the private sector.
Inter alia, the program aims to move a large number of young unskilled unemployed into jobs
combined with training with exoneration from social security contributions. Public sector
jobs will be created for 100,000 of them. An individual contract is to be signed with
revamped local employment agencies, and close follow-up is envisaged, which will require
increased budgetary resources. The staff argued for a better balance between rights and
obligations of participants so as to enhance the focus on moving people into market jobs.
26.
Progress has been ongoing in product market reform, but a broader approach is
needed. The authorities noted that the regulatory burden on existing firms had eased and
formalities involved in creating new enterprises been simplified appreciably. Network
industries were being opened to cross-border competition, and the statutes of the public
electricity and gas companies (EDF/GDF) had been changed—in the face of strong
employee opposition—to introduce the possibility of private participation in their capital.
The authorities saw this change as significantly outweighing the concessions that had been
made (such as the retention of a majority stake). A new government agency (Agence de
Participations de l’Etat) had strengthened the governance of state participation in enterprises,
and divestiture was being accelerated. The authorities concurred with the staff on the benefits
of speeding up the transformation of public enterprises and closing the considerable
transposition gap in EU internal market and competition directives. They also intended to
modify legislation to strengthen competition in the retail distribution sector.
27.
The staff welcomed the acceleration of divestiture but was critical of the
heightened emphasis on “national champions”. This emphasis was most recently
manifested in the support for a French partner in a pharmaceutical merger and the rescue of
an engineering firm. The staff noted that such an approach reduced competition, created
vested interests, deterred private investors, and constituted a form of protectionism. The
authorities dismissed these concerns and made clear they were committed to divesting the
state from participation in commercial activities, unless a strategic interest was involved.
They felt that, in supporting key industries, France was in practice no different from other
countries, but was simply more vocal about it, and that, in contrast to the rhetoric, France was
in reality very open to foreign participation. In any event, the new bankruptcy law would
make involvement of the state in rescue operations increasingly unnecessary as it would
allow easier restructuring of enterprises as going concerns.
D. Financial Sector
28.
The FSAP found that supervision and oversight of the financial sector are of
high standard and supervisory staff is highly qualified, and the authorities agreed with
most of its recommendations (Box 5). With the economic upturn, corporate deleveraging,
and equity markets well above post-bubble lows, banks and insurance companies had seen
their profitability and solvency strengthen. The FSAP found no immediate systemic risks on
present analysis, but recommended further strengthening of supervision through enhanced
coordination between the various supervisory agencies and vigilance on banks’ risk

- 25 -

Box 5: FSAP Main Policy Recommendations
While finding the financial sector resilient and its oversight and supervision of high
quality, the FSAP made the following main recommendations:
For efficiency reasons, ongoing efforts to diminish state influence over savings allocation
through administered savings schemes and fiscal incentives should be accelerated, with a
view to eventually establishing a fully market-based system. The key objective should be
their orderly phasing out. In the short term, the focus should be on reducing the distortions
caused by the schemes.
Given the degree of concentration in the financial system, continued vigilance is needed to
preserve strong competition. Ongoing efforts to improve disclosure and pricing transparency
for banking services should be continued. The separation of the postal office’s banking
activities and their subjection to standard prudential requirements is welcome, but the newly
created bank should be put as soon as possible on a “level-playing field” with other banks.
Competition at the retail level and the availability of financial services could further be
enhanced by eliminating the notion of "national champions" and introducing the positive credit
registry.
The corporate governance and risk-taking of banks need to be monitored carefully,
particularly when they expand into unfamiliar activities. Potential pressure on banks to
overexpand could be eased by reducing barriers to the return of profits to owners.
Creditor rights should be improved to facilitate credit provision. The ongoing reform of
the corporate bankruptcy legislation will clarify and limit the liability of creditors, while at the
same time enhancing the survival chances of troubled companies. In addition, banks should be
allowed to write off nonperforming loans without jeopardizing their legal claim on the debtor.
The overall legal and institutional framework for AML/CFT should be further improved
in some areas, mainly: the implementation of UN Security Council Special Resolution on
terrorism financing; the overall quality of suspicious transactions reporting; AML/CFT
regulation, supervision and enforcement for sectors other than credit institutions and certain
investment firms; and criteria for when financial institutions should exercise increased
diligence.

exposure. The authorities, while acknowledging that mechanisms that encourage strong
corporate governance in joint-stock companies were less effective for mutual banks, noted
that such banks had developed equivalent internal mechanisms to underpin good governance.
Moreover, they felt that risks were minimal as their management had proven to be
trustworthy and often on the conservative side. Risks involved in branching out in
nontraditional activities—which had increased recently—appeared limited as it typically
occurred in the context of acquisitions, which included the required expertise, and without
government guarantees.

- 26 -

29.
There was consensus that the financial sector should be made more efficient by
reducing state intervention. Staff analysis suggests that administered savings schemes
interfere with monetary transmission and efficient resource allocation (see Selected Issues
paper). Moreover, in light of population aging, it felt it would be sensible to focus budgetary
resources on the newly-created voluntary retirement savings plan (the tax exemptions on
administered savings schemes cost the budget about 0.25 percentage point of GDP per year).
The staff also noted that usury rates, which are set at four-thirds of actual average interest
rates, exclude some segments of the population from access to financial services, especially
when interest rates are low. The authorities expressed increased readiness to contemplate
changes in administered savings schemes and lift other restrictions (e.g., the interdiction of
remuneration of sight deposits and the obligation to provide checks free of charge), but felt
that this could not be done as immediately as staff suggested. The authorities acknowledged
the need for a full and swift implementation of measures to promote disclosure and
transparency of pricing of financial services, while considering the recent increases in bank
fees a normalization rather than an indication of lack of competition. They emphasized that
the creation of a postal bank would level the playing field in terms of supervision as the
financial services hitherto provided by the post office would be subject to regular
supervision.
30.
The removal of obstacles to financial innovation in the area of mortgage and
consumer credits is likely to be welfare improving. The authorities, who considered the
French savings ratio as structurally too high, were reviewing options to facilitate household
access to asset-backed credits such as mortgages and home equity loans. There were no legal
obstacles, but cumbersome and expensive approval procedures as well as problems in seizing
collateral were considered significant impediments. The supervisory authorities expressed
concerns about the volatility of asset prices and its repercussions on the amplitude of cyclical
fluctuations in demand and banks’ and households’ financial stability. They placed emphasis
on safeguards in the use of instruments such as home equity loans.
E. Other Issues
31.
France continues to strengthen its framework to combat money laundering and
terrorist financing, remaining proactively involved in these efforts at the European and
international levels, but further efforts are needed (Box 5). The OECD has judged France’s
legal framework as conforming to the anti-bribery convention’s requirements, but called for
a further strengthening of measures for more effective prevention and sanctioning of bribery
of foreign public officials.16
32.
While supporting the Doha round of multilateral trade talks, the authorities
pressed strongly for what they termed a “balanced” result. In their view, the EU
initiatives and offers, notably with respect to the abolition of agricultural export subsidies had
16

- 27 -

not drawn an equivalent response from other major trading nations. Singapore issues—in
particular trade facilitation and the protection of foreign investment—remained important,
although they agreed that successful conclusion of the Round would require flexibility on all
issues by all parties. More generally, the authorities expressed concern that unfettered trade
liberalization might not benefit developing countries, which often did not have the ability to
compete in global markets. France favored the development of local agricultural production
in Africa, preferential trade agreements with the ACP countries, insurance mechanisms
against volatility in certain agricultural prices such as cotton, and closer regional cooperation,
reinforced by regional customs unions. The staff pressed the case for a constructive approach
toward the WTO framework agreement then under negotiation, and encouraged early
implementation in France of CAP reform (currently set for 2007).
33.
The authorities were determined to further increase ODA from the 2003 level of
0.41 percent of GNP to the U.N. target of 0.7 percent of GNP in 2012. They noted that their
current level was the highest among G-7 countries and concentrated in Africa.
III. STAFF APPRAISAL
34.
The economy has staged a strong recovery and key reforms are making headway
in tackling the costs of aging, but serious challenges persist to secure higher potential
growth and long-term fiscal sustainability. The recovery is being driven by domestic
demand thanks in part to skillful implementation of key structural reforms geared to
promoting confidence. Following last year’s milestone pension reform, health care reform—
another key step toward fiscal sustainability—has been adopted. Ongoing and planned
reforms in product, labor and financial markets are likely to boost growth. At the same time,
however, much-needed fiscal consolidation is thwarted by heavy reliance on budgetary
resources to raise employment, while an impending demographic shock casts a shadow over
long-term growth prospects. The solution lies in an improvement of labor market institutions
to raise labor utilization without adverse consequences on the budget and in steadfast fiscal
consolidation.
35.
The economic recovery appears to be well-sustained, providing the sought-for
opportunity to proceed with sustained fiscal adjustment. Growth is set to average about
2½ percent per year during 2004–05, with risks broadly balanced and stemming
predominantly from the external side. Monetary conditions are likely to remain quite
accommodative as domestic demand is running ahead of that of the rest of the euro area.
Consequently, the recovery is unlikely to be threatened by a resumption of appreciable
underlying fiscal adjustment. Temporary incentives to promote household consumption could
be withdrawn, and all revenue windfalls from higher-than-expected growth should be saved.
36.
Securing long-run fiscal sustainability requires growth-enhancing structural
reforms and up-front fiscal consolidation. The authorities’ approach needs to be
strengthened on both fronts. The emphasis on growth-enhancing structural reforms is
welcome, but it needs to be backed up by the specification and implementation of reforms
that will effectively raise labor utilization without burdening the budget. In the absence of

- 28 -

such reforms, up-front consolidation should be pursued at a pace such as to achieve a small
structural surplus by the end of the decade when the costs of aging set in. And even with a
more decisive reform agenda, consolidation efforts need to be strengthened compared to
current plans. Once a reasonable fiscal down payment has been made, and the structural
balance is in a durable small surplus, a larger share of spending restraint should be allocated
to growth-enhancing tax cuts.
37.
A fundamental overhaul of labor market policies will be required to resolve the
tension between the policies followed to raise labor utilization and achieving fiscal
consolidation. As a priority, the employment protection regime and the role of the judiciary
in layoffs should be modified. The focus of the entitlement system needs to shift further from
income support to moving people into market jobs. Real increases in minimum wages and
benefits should be avoided to prevent exclusion of a rising number of potential workers or
welfare recipients from activity. Any new labor market programs should be funded by a
redeployment of existing resources; this applies in particular to the new “social cohesion”
program, which has a large budgetary cost. Ongoing initiatives to tighten job-search
requirements, establish private employment agencies, and reduce the duration of
unemployment benefits will improve labor market performance with likely positive effects
on the budget.
38.
Near-term nominal budget objectives appear within reach, but are unambitious
in terms of structural adjustment, especially in light of the stronger-than-envisaged
recovery. With higher-than-anticipated growth, and owing to commendable expenditure
restraint at the central government level, the targeted reduction of the deficit to just below
3 percent of GDP in 2005 should be feasible, but would represent little structural adjustment.
The targets for 2005 and beyond should be made more ambitious. This could inter alia be
achieved by advancing and strengthening health care reforms and by reducing the size of the
civil service in the context of the ongoing wave of retirements. Well-designed
decentralization that leads to efficiency improvements could be a further source of potential
savings.
39.
The present fiscal framework needs to be strengthened. The ongoing
implementation of an output-oriented budget law provides an improved framework to control
spending, while stepped-up interministerial coordination is helping to address an ingrained
spending culture. Proposals to supplement the framework with multiannual social security
budgets and an internal stability pact with local authorities should be implemented. To ensure
transparency and the correction of past overruns, multiyear spending ceilings should be set
for the general government in terms of the level of spending. To raise the political cost of
deviating from commitments, an independent agency could be established to conduct
forward-looking budget assessments, and the frequency of publication of general government
accounts could be raised. Finally, broadly symmetrical cyclical policy behavior is essential
for any rational fiscal policy rule, thus favoring a rule—over the current government
proposal—that permits full rather than partial operation of automatic stabilizers.

- 29 -

40.
Reducing the tax burden is desirable while modifications in the tax structure
could yield efficiency gains. Ideally, room should be made on the expenditure side to permit
the phasing out of the tax on capital (taxe professionnelle), a key source of revenue for local
authorities. But the tax raises considerable revenues and other options for local authority
financing will need to be explored. Consideration should be given to relying more on user
fees, increasing the intake from real estate taxes, phasing out VAT exemptions and reduced
rates, or placing a local surcharge on a broad revenue base.
41.
In product markets, the ongoing efforts to lighten the regulatory burden,
simplify administrative procedures, and promote divestiture are welcome. The reform of
the EDF/GDF statute marks a major step forward in this area. More broadly, the government
should follow through resolutely on its intention to withdraw from commercial activities, as
market conditions permit. The reform of the corporate bankruptcy legislation will help clarify
and limit the liability of creditors, while enhancing the survival chances of troubled
companies. However, more needs to be done to strengthen competition, in particular by
improving price transparency in financial services, and closing the significant transposition
gap of EU directives. The attractiveness of France as a place to produce and invest is best
defended by structural reforms in goods and labor markets. Emphasis on “national
champions” goes against the grain of such reforms and risks manipulation by vested interests.
42.
This year’s FSAP confirmed the resilience of France’s financial system and the
high quality of oversight and prudential supervision. The stress tests point to a resilient
system, and no systemic weaknesses were identified. Nonetheless, continuing vigilance is
needed, especially with respect to banks’ potentially risky expansions, and cooperation
among supervisory agencies could usefully be further strengthened. Some weaknesses in the
system for countering money laundering and the financing of terrorism and in the payment
systems area need to be addressed.
43.
Remaining administrative interventions in the financial system should be phased
out to improve resource allocation and the economy’s dynamism. The social goals
pursued through administered savings schemes could be achieved more efficiently—at a
lower cost to the budget and with less drag on monetary policy transmission—by more direct
means. Limits on lending interest rates should be lifted, and the restrictions on remunerating
sight deposits and charging for the use of checks should be lifted. Mortgage-based lending
should be further developed by lowering refinancing costs and removing cumbersome
regulations.
44.
In the trade area, France should associate itself fully with efforts to bring the Doha
round to a successful conclusion, in particular by supporting comprehensive liberalization of
agricultural markets. National implementation of the June 2003 reform of the CAP could
also usefully be moved forward. France’s contribution to development through its relatively
high level of ODA and its intention to reach the UN target by 2012 is commendable.
45.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard
12-month cycle.

FRANCE: STATISTICAL INFORMATION
France’s economic database is comprehensive and of high quality. The authorities regularly
publish a full range of economic and financial data and calendar dates of main statistical
releases are also provided. The transmission of data in electronic form from INSEE and the
profusion of data from various institutions (Banque de France, INSEE, ministry of finance,
ministry of labor and solidarity) have helped to build an infrastructure in which all data can
be easily accessed through the Economic Data Sharing System. As a subscriber to the Special
Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS), France posts its metadata on the Fund’s
Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB) on the Internet.
Since the beginning of 1999, France’s monetary and banking statistics methodology has
changed to reflect the standards of the European Monetary Union. Statistics for International
Financial Statistics on banking institutions and monetary aggregates are prepared on a
monthly basis and are timely.
France adopted the European System of Integrated Economic Accounts 1995 (ESA95) in
1999. Although data for GDP and its components are available since 1978, data for the
household, corporate, and public administration accounts are only available since 1992.
France produces annual national accounts aggregates on a quarterly and annual basis, but the
two estimates differ slightly due to revision practices.
Recent data issues include the need to provide monthly or quarterly developments not only in
the finances of the central government, but also in those of the social security and local
governments. These data should be presented in a comprehensive fashion and on a national
accounts basis, to facilitate monitoring of public finances.

France: Core Statistical Indicators
as of September 20, 2004

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
FRANCE
Staff Report for the 2004 Article IV Consultation
Supplementary Information
Prepared by the European Department
(In consultation with the Policy Development and Review Department)
Approved by Michael Deppler and G. Russell Kincaid
October 15, 2004
This supplement to the staff report for the 2004 Article IV consultation with
France provides an update on recent developments, in particular the authorities’ 2005
budget proposal and medium-term fiscal plans. The new information does not alter the
thrust of the staff appraisal, but the structural adjustment underlying the draft 2005 budget
falls well short of the amount envisaged in the Staff Report. Confidence surveys confirm the
strength of domestic demand, but recent indicators are somewhat mixed, and the surge in oil
prices has lowered the growth outlook. Despite the hike in oil prices, headline and underlying
inflation (12-month rates) both eased in September to 2.2 percent and 1.6 percent,
respectively. The draft 2005 budget aims to reduce the general government deficit to 2.9
percent of GDP, relying on higher growth and a substantial one-off measure (the move of the
electricity utility’s pension fund assets and accompanying future liabilities to the central
government). In other developments, in early October, the EU Court of Justice ruled that the
French prohibition of paying interest on sight deposits represents a restriction to the freedom
of establishment guaranteed by the EC Treaty. Finally, the Camdessus report—to be issued
on October 15—is expected to contain comprehensive recommendations on how to lift
obstacles to growth, and the authorities have indicated their intention to draw on it for action.
1.

The budget foresees steady growth of 2.5 percent in both 2004 and 2005, with
domestic demand sustaining the recovery.1 The staff now expects a deceleration in 2005 to
2.2 percent, reflecting a new, higher oil price baseline (Table 1).2 Recent data releases are
somewhat mixed. Overall consumer and business confidence improved, stocks are below
their average levels, and perceived inflation has been falling towards the actual rate, lately
possibly influenced by the announcement of price cuts by large retailers. However,
2.

1

The authorities’ estimate is calendar-day adjusted; with 2004 having 255 working days compared to 252 in
2003, actual nonadjusted growth could be 0.2–0.3 percentage points higher. The staff’s 2004 projection includes
a 0.2 percentage point calendar effect.

2

The WEO convention is to revise the oil price baseline once future prices on a weighted index of different
types of oil deviate by 10 percent from the previous assumption for more than ten days.

employment has so far failed to pick up, nonenergy industrial production growth slowed
significantly in August, and the trade balance posted a large deficit.
The budget proposal aims to reduce the deficit from 3.6 percent of GDP in 2004
to 2.9 percent of GDP in 2005, through expenditure restraint at the central government
level, savings from the health care reform, and the transfer of the electricity company
(EDF) pension fund. The 2005 objective remains, as previously announced, that of reducing
the general government deficit to below 3 percent of GDP—specifically to 2.9 percent of
GDP. Achievement of this target is facilitated by a 0.4 percentage point of GDP transfer of
the EDF pension fund (“soulte”) to the central government, as part of the reform of the
company’s statute (¶26 of the Staff Report). Real expenditure growth is planned to be held at
1.6 percent in 2005, the same rate as estimated for 2004, based on a projected deceleration of
nominal growth in health care spending from 5.2 percent to 3.2 percent and constant real
spending at the central government level. The number of civil servants is to be reduced by
7,200, corresponding to a replacement of about 7 out of 8 retirees (some 60,000 civil servants
are due to retire in 2005, as the wave of retirements begins in earnest). On the revenue side,
the exemption of new investments from the taxe professionnelle has been extended until
end-2005, the corporate income tax rate will decrease marginally, and the earned income tax
credit (PPE) will rise by 4 percent. The budget also includes a number of small tax cuts and
various new tax exemptions. Notwithstanding these revenue cuts, the tax burden rises
marginally due to the increases in social security contributions introduced by the health care
reform. The 2005 budget also takes further steps in the progressive implementation of the
2001 organic budget law, with an emphasis on objectives, outputs, and quantitative
performance indicators, which should increase transparency and accountability.3 Finally, a
modification to the organic law has been proposed requiring that each budget law contain an
ex ante specification of the use of any revenue windfalls. The initial proposal—that the
majority be devoted to debt reduction and the remainder to temporary tax cuts or investment
spending (¶20 of the Staff Report)—was considered by the relevant legal authority (Conseil
d’État) as too specific for an organic law. How any windfalls would be allocated in 2005 is
currently under discussion.
3.

Over the medium term (2006–08), the authorities reaffirm the intention to
improve the structural balance by about 0.5 percentage point of GDP per year. GDP is
assumed to grow by 2.5 percent per year (0.25 percentage point above the authorities’
estimate of potential growth), and overall real expenditure is targeted to grow by 1.2 percent
per year on average. The recent health care reform is expected to limit nominal growth of
health spending to 3.6 percent per year during 2006–08. With unemployment assumed to
decline gradually, the budget reaffirms the target of balancing the social security accounts
by 2007. The authorities estimate the total underlying adjustment at about 2 percentage points
of GDP over the four years 2005–08, bringing the general government structural deficit to
just below 1 percent of GDP by the end of the period; staff estimates differ as per the text
table below.

The draft 2005 budget falls short of the staff’s recommended substantial
structural adjustment, especially since it is not accompanied by further significant
growth-enhancing reforms or durable spending restraint. As regards the nominal deficit,
there is sufficient room to achieve the authorities’ target of 2.9 percent of GDP with only
marginal additional measures, even under the staff’s lower growth projections which yield a
revised deficit estimate of 3.0 percent of GDP.4 More importantly, though, the structural
effort (excluding the EDF soulte) amounts to less than ¼ percent of GDP, about ½ percent of
GDP less than staff advice.5 The reduction in the number of civil servants is welcome in a
historical perspective, as it confirms a turnaround in a long-standing trend of expanding
5.

Compared to the authorities, the staff deficit projection of 3.0 percent of GDP in 2005 reflects lower real GDP
growth and higher health spending growth which raise the deficit, but also a higher GDP deflator, which lowers
it.

In November 2003, the Ecofin Council recommended under the SGP’s excessive deficit procedure that France
reduce its cyclically-adjusted deficit by 0.8 percentage point of GDP in 2004 and at least 0.6 percentage point of
GDP in 2005 for a cumulative 1.4 percentage point of GDP.

public sector employment, but it remains limited against the background of the large size and
cost of public employment in France (Figure 1). The health care reform is an important step
toward longer-term fiscal sustainability. Ensuring early savings would, however, have
required advancing or strengthening some of its measures—without which staff remains
skeptical about the viability of reducing nominal health care spending growth to 3.2 percent
in 2005. On the revenue side, the suspension of earlier plans for further income tax cuts is
well-placed and in line with staff advice; at the same time, the budget contains a number of
small tax cuts and exemptions that are likely to have little sustained effects on growth and
employment and, contrary to announced intentions, increase tax niches.
Insufficient up-front adjustment increases the need to put in place concrete and
strengthened measures to achieve the underlying fiscal adjustment planned by 2008.
Under the staff’s projections, an additional 1 percentage point of GDP of structural effort
(excluding one-offs) will be necessary compared to the authorities’ intentions, even in a
strong reform scenario.6 Given a record of spending overruns in social security and without
more comprehensive spending reforms, there remain doubts about the feasibility of achieving
the targeted slowdown in expenditure growth. In addition, because of reliance on a large oneoff measure in 2005, the underlying structural adjustment implied by the authorities’
medium-term path is more challenging than it appears, particularly in 2006.

IMF Concludes 2004 Article IV Consultation with France
On October 20, 2004, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV Consultation with France.1
Background
The French economy has produced a strong upturn, especially in comparison with other large
euro-area countries. Initiated by a rebound in exports, domestic demand has become the driver
of growth, thanks to supportive policies and a favorable starting position. Savings rates were
unusually high, balance sheet problems in the corporate sector were confined to a small
number of large firms, the financial sector was profitable, and the housing market was robust.
The strength of private consumption reflects both fundamental and exceptional factors:
implementation of key social security reforms diminished uncertainty, prospects for growth and
inflation improved, and incomes of the cash constrained were supported. Fiscal measures were
implemented to help sustain the momentum in household spending. Fixed investment had been
weaker than usual during the downturn, with replacement investment being postponed, but after
a period of deleveraging and widening profit margins, business investment rebounded.
Residential construction strengthened, reflecting several years of rising house prices.
However, with higher oil prices and some softening of the external environment, the staff
expects real GDP growth to slow from 2.5 percent in 2004 to 2.2 percent in 2005, while official
forecasts foresee continuing growth at 2.5 percent. Headline inflation, which reached
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. This PIN summarizes the views of the Executive Board as expressed during
the Executive Board discussion based on the staff report.

-22.2 percent in September, is seen to remain persistent, slowly moderating in the course of 2005.
It will continue to reflect special factors––base effects from the tobacco tax increase, changes in
regulated prices, oil price volatility, and the price cut agreed by large distributors. Long-term
growth is being fettered by adverse demographics and structural weaknesses, a high tax and
regulatory burden and, despite its increase in the 1990s, a low degree of labor utilization.
The 2005 draft budget targets a reduction in the general government deficit to 2.9 percent of
GDP continuing the decline from 3.6 percent of GDP in 2004 and a peak of 4.1 percent of GDP
in 2003. Following a structural improvement of about 0.5 percentage point of GDP in 2004,
achieved through expenditure restraint at the central government level, the staff estimates the
structural balance to improve by 0.2 percentage point of GDP in 2005 (excluding the transfer of
the electricity utility’s pension fund, equivalent to 0.4 percentage point of GDP). Central
government expenditure is set to remain constant in real terms, but spending growth in other
areas is relatively high. The net tax burden rises marginally because the increase in
contributions related to the health care reform is not fully offset by a variety of smaller tax cuts in
other areas. The size of the civil service is set to decline, as about 12 percent of retiring civil
servants will not be replaced. For 2006–08, the authorities plan a steady reduction in the
structural deficit by one-half of a percentage point per year on average, to reach a level of just
below 1 percent of GDP by the end of the period. The health care reform is assumed to achieve
a durable deceleration of annual nominal spending growth to 3.6 percent during 2006–08, and
the volume of overall spending is targeted to increase by 1.2 percent per year on average.
On structural issues, a health care reform has established the key instruments to gain control
over the system’s budget, with adjustable parameters to influence its revenues as well as the
behavior of patients, providers, and insurance agencies. Ongoing civil service reform and
decentralization are providing the opportunity to realize efficiency gains and tailor public
services better to local needs. In product markets, the statutes of the public electricity and gas
companies have been changed, opening the door for private investment; the authorities intend
to accelerate divestiture from commercial activities as market conditions permit; and steps are
being taken to accelerate the transposition of EU internal market and competition directives.
In labor markets, cuts in social security contributions are set to continue to mitigate the impact
of rising minimum wages stemming from the implementation of the 35-hour workweek; social
partners have been allowed to negotiate derogations from the workweek regulations, including
at the enterprise level; and the earned income tax credit has been raised. Other possible
changes to labor market institutions––notably as regards employment protection––have for now
been left to negotiations among the social partners. A “social cohesion” program has been
adopted to bring people back to the labor market, relying on fiscal incentives and closer
administrative follow-up of unemployed and benefit recipients, as well as public sector
employment schemes.
The Financial System Stability Assessment conducted by IMF staff this year found no
immediate systemic financial sector risk and confirmed the high quality of oversight and
prudential supervision of the financial sector. It recommended a further strengthening of
supervision through enhanced coordination and vigilance on banks’ risk exposure.

-3Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors congratulated the French authorities for their skillful pursuit of reform
policies, which have fostered confidence and supported an early and robust economic recovery.
They welcomed the resumption of structural fiscal adjustment in 2004. Pension and health care
reforms have improved the long-term fiscal outlook against the background of the impending
demographic shock, while ongoing reforms in product markets are likely to boost growth.
Directors urged the authorities to build on the strong performance by strengthening structural
reforms and stepping up fiscal consolidation to secure higher long-term growth and fiscal
sustainability. A key challenge will be to improve labor market institutions to raise labor
utilization, while reducing the reliance of employment policies on budgetary resources.
Directors observed that the recent economic recovery has been driven by domestic demand.
Downside risks exist on the external front. Although the pace of growth is likely to slow in 2005,
mainly as a result of higher oil prices, France’s economic outlook remains comparatively
favorable. With monetary conditions likely to remain quite accommodative from France’s
perspective, stronger fiscal consolidation is unlikely to threaten the recovery.
In this setting, Directors urged the authorities to proceed decisively with fiscal adjustment. They
saw a need to strengthen adjustment in 2005 compared to current budget plans, given France’s
weak underlying budgetary position and rising public debt. They noted that recourse to a
pension fund transfer from the electricity utility would be a one-off measure, and not a durable
fiscal adjustment. Directors considered that the alternative of genuine structural adjustment
through reinforced expenditure restraint is feasible, inter alia through advancing and
strengthening health care reform measures and reducing the large size of public employment by
making more decisive use of the opportunity provided by the ongoing wave of retirements.
Directors considered that the intended cumulative fiscal consolidation by 2008 is broadly
appropriate. It should be complemented by the early implementation of comprehensive growthenhancing reforms to secure long-run fiscal sustainability. In the absence of concrete measures
in this direction, Directors felt that credibility would require stronger up-front and sustained
adjustment until a small underlying surplus is achieved.
Directors stressed that early fiscal adjustment and growth-enhancing structural reforms will be
essential to create room for a much-needed reduction in France’s high tax burden. In the
meantime, consideration should be given to changes in the tax structure to yield efficiency gains
and remove distortions, especially those on capital and labor. Some Directors questioned the
increased recourse to tax exemptions, with doubtful economic benefits, in the 2005 draft
budget.
To ensure successful consolidation, Directors encouraged the authorities to continue
strengthening France’s fiscal framework. They welcomed the ongoing implementation of the
output-oriented budget law and the efforts to address an ingrained spending culture at the
central government level. They recommended the extension of this approach to social security
and local authorities, where spending control has proven more difficult. Directors saw merit in
setting multi-year limits on the level of general government spending. A few considered that

-4establishing an independent agency to conduct forward-looking budget assessments would be
useful. Directors stressed that preserving cyclical revenue windfalls will be crucial for fiscal
consolidation and considered that the envisaged rule governing the ex ante allocation of such
windfalls should allow for full play of automatic stabilizers to avoid structural slippages.
Directors emphasized the need for further efforts to reorient labor market policies, in order to
move away from the current heavy reliance on budgetary measures. These measures had been
instituted to mitigate the adverse consequences on labor costs and employment of high and
rising minimum wages, the mandatory 35-hour workweek, and high marginal tax and benefit
replacement rates. Directors stressed the need for comprehensive reforms of employment
protection and benefits to sharpen incentives to work. They viewed the ongoing initiatives to
tighten job-search requirements and reduce the duration of unemployment benefits as steps in
the right direction. They called for further efforts to refocus entitlement systems toward moving
people into market jobs. Other steps in this direction could include reducing the role of the
judiciary in layoffs, ensuring greater flexibility in workweek regulations, and slowing the real
increases in minimum wages and benefits, which have had the effect of excluding a large
number of potential workers from activity. A number of Directors questioned the role assigned to
public sector jobs in the new “social cohesion” program, while a few Directors felt that the
program could help reconnect people with the labor force and reduce structural unemployment.
Directors suggested that the cost effectiveness of this program be monitored closely. Directors
welcomed the report of the Camdessus Commission, which makes far-reaching
recommendations to enhance France’s growth potential and reduce unemployment.
In product markets, Directors welcomed ongoing efforts to lighten the regulatory burden,
simplify administrative procedures, and promote divestiture of commercial activities. They
valued the change in the statutes of the electricity and gas utilities, which has introduced the
possibility of private capital participation. Directors looked forward to the pending reform of
corporate bankruptcy legislation. Directors believed that the attractiveness of France for
investors is best defended by reforms in the goods and labor markets and steps to strengthen
competition, rather than by an emphasis on “national champions.”
Directors noted that the French financial sector has increased its resilience with the economic
upturn. They welcomed the findings of the Financial Sector Stability Assessment, which has
confirmed the high quality of oversight and prudential supervision. They recommended
continued vigilance with respect to banks’ potentially risky expansions, intensified cooperation
among supervisory agencies, improved price transparency in financial services, and enhanced
competition in the financial sector. Directors also encouraged the authorities to phase out
remaining administrative interventions in the financial system, so as to improve resource
allocation and monetary transmission. Directors welcomed France’s leadership role and
ongoing efforts to apply international standards against money laundering and the financing of
terrorism and looked forward to the implementation of further reforms to strengthen this
framework.
Directors commended France’s contribution to official development assistance and looked
forward to a further increase toward the U.N. target level. They encouraged France to promote
efforts to bring the Doha round to a successful conclusion, in particular by supporting
comprehensive liberalization of agricultural markets. Several Directors felt that moving forward

-5the national implementation of the June 2003 reform of the Common Agricultural Policy would
be helpful in this respect.
