INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
MALDIVES
Staff Report for the 2009 Article IV Consultation and
Request for a Stand-By Arrangement and a 24-Month Arrangement Under the
Exogenous Shocks Facility
Prepared by the Asia and Pacific Department
(in consultation with other departments)
Approved by Kalpana Kochhar and Aasim Husain
November 25, 2009
Executive Summary
Context. The Maldivian economy is facing large external and fiscal imbalances, resulting from the severe impact
of the global financial crisis and exacerbated by an unsustainable fiscal expansion. The global crisis has led to
sharp declines in tourism and related investment, other net capital flows, and exports. This has caused a
significant fall in fiscal revenue, compounding a large increase in public spending, and pushed the economy into
recession. A rising share of the resulting fiscal deficit has been financed by monetization. Despite foreign
exchange rationing by the Maldives Monetary Authority (MMA), international reserves have fallen to about two
months of imports.
Program: The authorities are requesting assistance under a blended arrangement (600 percent of quota, or SDR
49.2 million, over 36 months under a Stand-By Arrangement, and 100 percent of quota, or SDR 8.2 million, over
24 months under the Exogenous Shock Facility-High Access Component), designed to provide financing to
smooth adjustment to the external shock, restore fiscal and external stability while protecting social spending, and
address weaknesses in the banking system. The core of the policy framework is a strong fiscal adjustment to
contain aggregate demand and put public finances back on a sustainable medium-term path, complemented by
monetary tightening and measures to strengthen the banking sector.
Discussions: A staff team consisting of J. Carter (head), C. Park, A. Pitt (all APD), and M. Oliva (SPR) visited
Malé during June 3-16, 2009. Discussions continued in a second visit (August 3–19, 2009), staffed by J. Carter
(head), R. Cubero, C. Park, A. Pitt (all APD), R. Basu (SPR), and R. Maino (MCM). The staff met with the
President, the Minister of Finance and Treasury, the Governor of the MMA, other officials, members of the
Parliament’s Public Finance Committee, commercial banks, donors, and private sector representatives.
Previous Article IV Consultation: The Executive Board discussion of the 2008 Article IV Consultation is
summarized in the Public Information Notice No. 08/115 at www.imf.org.
Exchange rate system: Maldives has a conventional fixed peg against the U.S. dollar. Maldives continues to
avail itself of the transitional provisions of Article XIV, and has not yet accepted the obligations of Article VIII,
Sections 2, 3, and 4. It maintains an exchange restriction and a multiple currency practice subject to Fund
approval under Article VIII, Sections 2(a) and 3 of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement, arising from the MMA’s
policy of rationing its supply of foreign exchange to commercial banks. The authorities plan to gradually
eliminate this restriction over the course of the program.
Data provision is adequate for effective surveillance and program monitoring, but some weaknesses remain.

I. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK FOR 2009
1.
Maldives is facing severe fiscal and external imbalances. A rapid fiscal expansion
after the 2004 tsunami, including steep wage bill increases, pushed public expenditure to
63 percent of GDP in 2008. From mid-2008, the global crisis significantly exacerbated the
existing imbalances and severely weakened the country’s balance of payments position
(Box 1). As in other tourism-based economies, such as those in the Caribbean, tourism
revenue has been badly affected by the global downturn, reducing fiscal and foreign
exchange earnings and driving the economy into recession. Also, net capital inflows have
fallen sharply. The loss in fiscal revenues, combined with the continued growth in public
expenditures, have led to a dramatic increase in the fiscal deficit in 2008–09, much of which
has been monetized. In the face of lax fiscal policy and the external shocks, supporting a
fixed exchange rate—pegged to the U.S. dollar at 12.8 rufiyaas per dollar since 2001—has
resulted in significant reserve losses, forcing the MMA to ration foreign exchange.
2.
External shocks have prompted a decline in economic activity and inflation.
After growth of 5¾ percent in 2008, real GDP is expected to shrink by about 4 percent in
2009, driven by the decline in tourism—arrivals are forecast to fall by 7 percent, compared to
last year—and a retrenchment of the construction sector, which is projected to shrink by
almost one-quarter as tourism projects are delayed. Inflation has been falling rapidly, to
3 percent year-on-year (y/y) in August, on the back of lower import prices. However, an
increase in international fuel prices and domestic electricity tariffs is expected to push it up in
the second half of 2009 to about 6¾ percent y/y.
3.
The impact of the global crisis has turned an unsustainable fiscal expansion into
a serious near-term risk to macroeconomic stability.


Government expenditure almost doubled as a share of GDP between 2004 and 2008,
and, without adjustment, is on course to reach 69 percent of GDP by end-2009. A key
driver has been the wage bill, stemming from large wage increases and a build-up in
the number of public sector employees. As the charts below show, public
employment and the wage bill are now very high by international standards.

The net negative impact of the exogenous shock on the balance of payments is estimated
at about US$309 million (24½ percent of 2009 GDP) in 2009–10. This includes cumulative
losses on exports, tourism and net capital inflows, offset by reduced tourism- and investmentrelated imports and gains from the decline in food and fuel prices (see table).
Adjustment to these shocks will rely largely on import compression, supported by fiscal
retrenchment. Significant import contraction started this year, reflecting reduced private
sector income, stagnant domestic credit, and foreign exchange rationing by the MMA. With
the large fiscal adjustment envisaged in the program, imports would remain subdued through
2011–12. The shock has also resulted in large reserves losses: reserves will remain below
their medium-term target of about 3½–4 months of imports through 2011.
Multilateral financing will be critical to meet the residual balance of payments needs
and support the adjustment effort. Total financing from the IMF, World Bank, and ADB is
projected at US$81 million for 2009–10. Under the proposed Fund arrangement with an
SBA/ESF blend, the ESF would cover the two years that are primarily affected by the fallout
from the global crisis, while the 36-month SBA would support the strong fiscal adjustment
needed over the medium term to restore the sustainability of the underlying external position.

1/ A positive number indicates a detrimental effect.



The state-owned electricity company (STELCO) has been experiencing large
operating losses, as electricity tariffs have not been raised in line with international
fuel prices. The implicit electricity subsidies, financed through government transfers,
have been budgeted at about 2½ percent of GDP in 2009, and could exceed that in the
absence of tariff adjustment.



The external shocks caused by the global crisis significantly intensified the fiscal
imbalances. Revenue has been shrinking on account of slower imports (as customs
duties represent a key source of revenue), lower tourism inflows, and postponed lease
payments from embattled tourist resort projects.



As a result, the fiscal deficit rose to 13¾ percent of GDP in 2008 and, if corrective
action is not undertaken, could reach 33 percent of GDP in 2009 while public debt
would soar to 97 percent of GDP.

4.
The external shocks have caused serious balance of payments difficulties. With
public expenditure rising fast and weaker tourism growth, the current account deficit
widened to 51 percent of GDP in 2008. In 2009, the severe negative external shocks from the
global crisis contributed to a decline in capital inflows and a domestic slowdown, and led to
foreign exchange rationing by the MMA (Box 1). These forces, combined with lower import

6
prices, have prompted a very sharp import contraction, more than offsetting the decline in
tourism inflows. As a result, the current account deficit is expected to moderate significantly
in 2009, to 30 percent of GDP. The reduced availability of external financing, including
credit lines for banks and funding for tourism projects, has led to an overall balance of
payments deficit and continued reserve losses. Even after the recent SDR allocations, gross
international reserves stood at 2¼ months of imports at end-September, 2009; usable
reserves, which exclude foreign currency deposits at the MMA, were down to less than
3 weeks of imports.1
5.
Monetary policy has been constrained by fiscal dominance—the government had
been able to borrow without limit from the MMA—and the fixed exchange rate regime. In
the absence of open market operations (introduced only in August 2009), any excess money
supply from deficit monetization had ultimately been reabsorbed via reserve losses. Strong
capital inflows kept the money supply growing at double-digit rates for several years through
mid-2008, but the global shocks led to dollar shortages and significant reserve losses. The
MMA has been rationing the supply of foreign exchange to the banking system at US$ 2.3
million per week, and a parallel market has emerged with a premium of around 10 percent
over the official peg.2, 3 While information is scant, this rate has apparently remained
relatively stable over the past several months.
6.
The real effective exchange rate (REER) has appreciated recently, but remains
below historical averages (Box 2). After depreciating steadily from 2001 to mid-2008, the
REER appreciated over the last year, on account of a stronger US dollar and higher inflation
in Maldives relative to its trading partners. However, the REER remains below its 10-year
average, and its path has also remained below those of relevant comparators. A quantitative
analysis, based on CGER-type methodologies, suggests that under baseline (adjustment)
policies the current peg is consistent with medium-term fundamentals.

1

The general SDR allocation provided SDR 6.1 million (US$9.6 million) on August 28, 2009, and a further
special allocation of SRD 1.3 million (US$2 million) took place on September 9, 2009.
2

The official foreign exchange market involves the MMA, commercial banks, and licensed money changers.
The MMA sells foreign exchange to banks (at a rate of US$1 = 12.85 rufiyaas) and the public sector (at a rate of
US$1 = 12.80 rufiyaas). The amount provided weekly to banks has been similar for several years, but became
binding since mid-2008. Foreign exchange supplied to the public sector has so far not been subject to
limitations.
3

There is no evidence that foreign exchange rationing to the banks has led to external payments arrears by the
private sector.

for the period 1999–2008. Unit labor
cost data are not available, but would likely show a larger appreciation, as the rapid increase in
public sector wages is likely to have had an impact on economy-wide wages.
CGER-type methodologies suggest that the REER is consistent with medium-term
fundamentals under the baseline (adjustment) scenario. While the current account is currently
inconsistent with its medium-term norm, by 2013 the external accounts would return to equilibrium
under the envisaged program adjustment. For given elasticities, this implies that the REER is
significantly overvalued at present but its medium term path under the baseline is consistent with
fundamentals (Table 1). Risks to the program, including delayed or insufficient fiscal adjustment,
would of course also affect external sustainability.

The global crisis and the domestic downturn have put significant stress on the
banking system. With a high exposure to the tourism sector and the concentration of loans in
a few large borrowers, some banks have experienced a significant increase in non-performing
loans (NPLs). While banks’ reported capital position is still strong, potentially large losses
from NPLs could compromise their balance sheets. Also, the global financial crisis has
reduced financing options (e.g., lines of credit, parent financing). Banks have substantial
domestic liquidity buffers (including excess reserves at the MMA) and long net open
positions in foreign exchange. However, their still large (though declining) negative net
foreign asset position, large exposure to short-term external financing, and high loan-todeposit ratio in foreign currency, makes them vulnerable to dollar liquidity shocks.
Deteriorating asset quality, a difficult economic outlook, and constrained financing have led
private sector credit growth to grind to a halt in 2009, after several years of very high growth
rates.

however, did not deliver a majority for the President’s Maldivian Democratic Party, with the
opposition (Mr. Gayoom’s party) winning the most seats. Political compromises will
therefore be inevitable. Prioritizing the government’s ambitious legal reform agenda—which
includes legislation on new tax measures, tax administration, privatizations, land tenure, and
investment—will therefore be required.

10
II. MEDIUM-TERM OUTLOOK
9.
In the adjustment scenario, the Maldivian economy is expected to return to fiscal
and external sustainability over the medium term.4


Real GDP growth is expected to rebound in 2010. Tourism inflows and tourismrelated investment are projected to recover as global economic activity picks up later
this year and international financial markets normalize. This, combined with a more
stable macroeconomic environment and renewed confidence in the economy, should
boost investment and growth. Real GDP growth is projected to increase to 3½ percent
in 2010 and reach about 4½ percent in 2014. The strong fiscal adjustment is expected
to be a relatively minor drag on growth, given the high import intensity of public and
private spending. But coupled with a more moderate pace of tourist resort expansion
and supply constraints on fishing, growth is projected to average around 4 percent in
2010-14, compared with 6½ for the ten years to 2008.



The moderation in international commodity prices, and tighter fiscal and monetary
policies, should help inflation decline gradually to about 3 percent in 2012–14, after a
temporary increase in 2011 due to the introduction of a goods and services tax.



Stronger fiscal revenues, on account of tax reforms and the domestic recovery,
combined with a sharp reduction in expenditure, should lead to a rapid fiscal
improvement, with the overall deficit falling to 1 percent of GDP by 2014 and the
primary balance turning to surplus from 2011.



With the recovery in tourism, and imports held down by fiscal and monetary
adjustment, the current account deficit is projected to narrow sharply to about
8 percent in 2014, within its sustainability bound (Box 2). Gross international
reserves are projected to increase gradually to about 3¾ months of imports by 2014.

4

The adjustment scenario under the program is the baseline scenario for projections in this report and the
accompanying debt sustainability analysis. There are considerable upside and downside risks to the outlook.
The key risk factors are outlined in section VI below.

In a scenario with no policy changes, the fiscal and external paths would remain
unsustainable. In the absence of policy adjustment, the fiscal deficit would remain high
despite a cyclical (non-discretionary) increase in revenue, deficit monetization would
continue, and public debt would soar. The current account deficit would decline more slowly,
with international reserves falling to a minimum (assumed here at one month of imports),
forcing the country to increasingly ration foreign exchange.5 While tourism would still
recover on the back of a stronger global economy, private investment would be dragged
down by a loss of confidence in the domestic economy, and crowded out by high interest
5

This scenario assumes no currency crisis (the official peg is maintained at the current level), but increasing
rationing would force more transactions into the parallel market and keep a lid on the current account deficit.

rates from the government’s rising borrowing requirements. As a result, real GDP growth
would at best recover along a very slow path, and higher domestic demand and monetization
would keep inflation above the baseline projection.
III. PROGRAM DISCUSSIONS
11.
Background. The authorities are well aware that the current economic situation is
very serious, with an unsustainable fiscal policy considerably aggravated by the sudden and
temporary exogenous shocks from the global crisis. Confronting this calls for a combination
of adjustment, to deal with underlying fiscal imbalances and absorb excess liquidity from
deficit monetization, and financing, to accommodate the temporary shocks and rebuild
international reserves. The authorities believe that a Fund-supported program would help
them achieve those goals, by smoothing the impact of the exogenous shocks—including by
mobilizing donor financing—and underpinning a strong macroeconomic policy framework to
restore macroeconomic stability, achieve medium-term sustainability, and create the

15
conditions for strong growth and poverty reduction. (The policies in the authorities’ program
are described in the attached Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies, MEFP).
12.
Fiscal policy objectives. At the core of the program is a very large fiscal adjustment
to restore fiscal sustainability. The authorities are committed to drastically bringing down the
fiscal deficit, including by unwinding part of the recent large expenditure increases. This is in
line with their campaign manifesto’s aim to reform the civil service and reduce the state’s
role in the economy. They are taking immediate action to cut spending, and are planning to
introduce new revenue measures. The impact of the adjustment will be limited in 2009, but
will be felt more fully in 2010 and beyond. The fiscal deficit is projected to fall from an
estimated 33 percent of GDP in 2009 if no corrective action is taken, to under 18 percent of
GDP in 2010 and about 4¼ percent of GDP in 2011.
13.
Fiscal adjustment measures. Fiscal adjustment combines expenditure and revenue
measures.


Wage bill. The wage bill, which as explained above has been a key driver of the
unsustainable fiscal expansion in recent years, will be reduced through a combination
of salary adjustments and staff retrenchment. Effective October 1, 2009, the Civil
Service Commission (CSC) implemented a reduction in civil service wages of
between 10 and 20 percent, depending on rank, for an average cut of 14 percent. The
adjustment will be reversed when central government’s domestic revenue reaches
7 billion rufiyaas, which under staff projections would be in 2011. Equivalent cuts
have been extended to non-civil service government employees. Staff reductions in
the civil service are to be completed by end-2010.6 Of these, some civil servants will
be transferred to the private sector, as part of a process of corporatization of certain
public services (airports, public works, schools, hospitals).7 With these measures, the
wage bill is expected to fall from 28 percent of GDP in 2009 to 17½ percent by 2011,
but would go up to 19¼ percent in 2012 as the recent wage adjustments are reversed.
The 2010 Budget, reflecting these and other measures to be implemented in 2009 and
2010, was submitted to the Majlis (Parliament) in November.

6

There are currently about 38,000 central government employees. Staff redundancies entail severance
payments, which reduce the net fiscal savings.

7

The rationale for the corporatization of services is explained in the MEFP.

16


Other spending. Operational expenses have also been cut by about 2 percent of GDP,
and non-priority, domestically-financed capital projects have been postponed, and
will be temporarily trimmed by about 1 percent of GDP in 2010.



Electricity subsidies. Electricity tariffs have been raised, effective November 1, 2009,
with the increase ranging from 40 to 60 percent, depending on consumption brackets,
to reduce the impact on smaller consumers. Tariffs will be adjusted in future in line
with a cost-based formula linked to fuel prices, with targeted subsidies to protect
vulnerable segments of the population. This reform eliminates the need for central
government subsidies to STELCO, and enables the electricity company to resume
servicing of loans from the government.



Revenues. On the revenue side, the airport tax has been transferred to the central
government, effective November 2009, and its rate has been raised by about
29 percent. A business profit tax is planned to be passed by end-2009 (structural
benchmark). In addition, in line with longstanding staff advice, the authorities are
pressing on to introduce a new ad valorem hotel room tax by October 2010, expected
to yield almost three times the revenues of the current specific tourism tax of US$8

17
per bed per night it replaces (structural benchmark).8 Finally, they plan to introduce a
goods and services tax by early 2011, with Fund technical assistance (structural
benchmark). Together, the revenue measures are expected to yield as much as 15½
percent of 2009 GDP, once their full-year impact materializes.


Deficit financing. From September, the monetization of the fiscal deficit has been
stopped. Domestic deficit financing has been restricted to t-bill sales to commercial
banks and state-owned enterprises. An auction system for t-bill placements will be set
up by end-2009 (structural benchmark). In addition, the authorities plan to privatize a
number of state-owned enterprises. They have already sold a stake of the telecoms
company for US$40 million, and a majority stake in the airport is expected to be sold
in the coming months. Privatization proceeds will provide a short-term source of
financing. Funding is also expected to be assisted by the purchase, by the local branch
of the State Bank of India (SBI), of 2–3 year dollar-denominated bonds for US$100
million.

14.
Social protection. The current economic recession will undoubtedly have a negative
impact on the most vulnerable segments of the population. The program aims to protect
social spending and lay the foundations for sustained poverty reduction. Under the program,
social welfare contributions, pensions, and spending on relief for the tsunami victims will be
protected. As mentioned above, the subsidy for electricity—which disproportionately
benefited the higher income strata of the population in Malé—has been replaced by a costbased pricing scheme combined with targeted relief for the poor. The authorities are also
committed to enhancing the targeting of food, medicine, water and other subsidies.
Adjustments in public sector wages and allowances will be implemented in a manner that
affects lower earners proportionally less. Measures are being taken to shield the poor from
the effects of public service corporatization (for instance, through scholarships in the case of
education). Finally, the authorities are committed to protecting expenditure on social housing
and on improving transport links to the outer atolls.
15.
Growth promotion. The program aims to stimulate faster real GDP growth by
providing a stronger macroeconomic policy framework. This should help restore investors’
confidence in the economy, and—through this and lower public sector domestic and external
debt—reduce the country risk premium. The program also seeks to protect priority capital

18
expenditure and spending on human development as much as possible. Though not directly
part of program conditionality, the authorities’ policies for state reform aim to make the
public sector leaner and more efficient, including by privatizing enterprises and services that
can be more efficiently provided by the private sector (paragraph 19).
16.
Monetary policy. Monetary policy will support the fiscal adjustment efforts by
tightening domestic currency liquidity in order to stem reserve losses. A key step, adopted in
September, was to halt the monetization of the deficit. At the same time, the government debt
stock with the MMA has been converted into tradable securities. Starting in August, the
MMA has been using these securities as underlying collateral to conduct open market
operations (OMOs) through reverse repos, contributing to reverse the impact of years of
deficit monetization on liquidity (Box 3).

19
Box 3. Open Market Operations
With the purpose of absorbing the high levels of rufiyaa liquidity that deficit monetization
has created, the MMA introduced in August 2009 open market operations through reverse
repos (RRP), using government securities as collateral. While the current levels of excess
liquidity could have justified the use of outright sales of government securities, RRP were
preferred because: (i) the banks’ appetite for long-term placements in government bonds
was unknown; and (ii) reversible transactions increase the need for subsequent operations
and hence contribute to creating a money market.
Features:









Between August and September 2009, the total debt of the government with the
MMA was converted into bonds, with maturities ranging between 1–15 years and
fixed interest rates between 6–9 percent, payable semi-annually.
RRPs are held weekly on Thursdays, with the settlement on Sunday (Friday and
Saturday are not working days), overlapping the reporting period for minimum
reserve requirements, to facilitate banks’ liquidity management.
The term of the RRPs is one week.
The MMA does not announce the targeted amounts or interest rates.
Each bank may submit 3 different bids specifying the amount (number of securities)
and interest rate. Bids are binding for the banks.
The MMA collects the bids and a newly-established Market Operations Committee
submits a proposal to the governor regarding the result of the tender (accepted
amount, marginal, and average interest rate). The final decision belongs to the
governor, and the result (total bids, accepted amount, and average interest rate) is
made public the same day.

The first RRPs were encouraging: accepted bids increased every week during the first four
weeks, while interest rates remained low. Banks are reluctant to bid amounts that would
leave them with low free reserves, and are testing the willingness of the MMA to accept
bids at higher rates. Interest rates are likely to go up, once the MMA increases the amounts
awarded.

17.
Exchange rate policy. The authorities and staff concur that the pegged regime and its
level remain appropriate, conditional on the implementation of the policy adjustment in line
with the program.

20


The fixed exchange rate regime has served Maldives well by providing an effective
nominal anchor.



Staff analysis indicates that, on the basis of the policy adjustment envisaged in the
program, the peg remains appropriate. The real exchange rate is consistent with the
medium-term fundamentals under the baseline scenario (Box 2). This suggests that it
is the underlying domestic fiscal and monetary policies that are at the root of the large
current external imbalances, not the exchange rate per se.



The authorities and staff agree that a devaluation is not appropriate in current
circumstances. A devaluation of the rufiyaa would have only a small impact on the
composition of expenditure: given Maldives’ high import dependence, based on
natural and structural constraints, the scope for expenditure switching is very limited.
Instead, a devaluation would impact mainly through expenditure reducing effects, by
increasing the domestic currency cost of imports (with a rapid and large pass-through
effect on domestic consumer prices). The net fiscal impact in 2009 would be limited
if public sector wages are frozen, and could be negative if wages are increased. A
devaluation could also lead to a loss of confidence and invite speculation, in a context
of low reserves.



The authorities’ program aims to retain the current peg by containing demand
pressures through a significant fiscal and monetary tightening, and by boosting
confidence through the build-up of international reserves secured by new external
financing. Should the policy adjustment not be implemented as envisaged in the
program, the peg might become unsustainable. The appropriateness of the exchange
rate level and the regime itself will be continuously assessed over the program period.



As conditions stabilize, the authorities intend to gradually phase out the rationing of
foreign exchange supplied to commercial banks, by increasing the amounts provided.

18.
Financial sector policies. The authorities and staff agree that the financial system
needs to be strengthened. The authorities have indicated their intention to restructure the
Bank of Maldives (BML)’s portfolio, ensuring speedy action for the recovery of collateral on
defaulted debt, and, as necessary, secure a capital infusion. Their preferred option is to find a
strategic partner to take over the state’s shares. The authorities have also agreed to seek
passage of the Banking Law and the reforms to the MMA Act by end-2010 (structural
benchmark). This legislation will provide a stronger legal framework for the operation,
supervision, regulation, intervention and liquidation of commercial banks.
IV. OTHER (ARTICLE IV) POLICY DISCUSSIONS
19.
Staff supports the authorities’ plans for the privatization of a number of stateowned enterprises and services. The government has set up a Privatization Committee to

21
conduct and oversee the process. A central plank will be the privatization of the airport, but
stakes in the telecommunications company have already been sold and other enterprises and
services (such as electricity, water and sewage) could also be divested. The main goal of the
government’s privatization plan is to enhance the economy’s productivity and boost longterm growth through the transfer of activities that can be more efficiently conducted by the
private sector. In addition, privatization proceeds provide a helpful, though finite, source of
deficit financing and, in case of foreign investor participation, provide a relief to dollar
shortages. Privatization efforts, however, are not part of program conditionality.
20.
The authorities have initiated actions to improve public financial management,
with Fund and World Bank assistance. A recently completed Public Expenditure and
Financial Accountability (PEFA) report concludes that there are significant shortfalls in the
predictability and control of budget execution and in the management of cash, debt, and
guarantees, and recommends preparing a comprehensive framework for fiscal risk
assessment and management. Some steps have already been taken. The introduction of a
treasury single account has strengthened the government’s control of public revenue and
spending, but several budget entities still retain separate bank accounts. The authorities are
also adopting a new Public Accounting System (PAS), to enhance accounting and reporting,
as well as budget control and execution. Staff welcome the commitment to introduce debt
management units at the MMA and the Ministry of Finance, along with transparent
guidelines on borrowing, on-lending and the provision of public guarantees. The staff
supports the President’s planned administrative decentralization, including the transfer of
competencies to provincial and local authorities. This, however, should be achieved without
increasing public expenditures.
21.
Some progress has been made in financial regulation and supervision, but
significant weaknesses and vulnerabilities remain. Loan classification and provisioning
are inadequate. Loan portfolio concentration has exposed banks to severe risks in case of
impaired loans from a few borrowers. Banks have accumulated large imbalances between
foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities, i.e. long open positions in foreign
currencies. In response, the authorities issued in May 2009 several regulations to strengthen
the prudential framework, in line with Fund technical assistance, comprising inter alia rules
on capital adequacy; limits on loans to related persons and single borrowers; asset
classification and provisioning; external audits; publication and disclosure; and corporate
governance. However, supervision and enforcement need to be strengthened, including
standing firm on asset classification and provisioning rules. Staff also recommended adopting
the regulation to limit open foreign currency positions, implementing and diligently
enforcing the licensing regulatory framework, and passing the Banking Law and the reforms
to the MMA Act (a structural benchmark under the program).

22
V. PROGRAM MODALITIES
22.
Facilities and access level. The Maldivian economy has been hit by large sudden and
exogenous shocks to exports, tourism, tourism-related investment, and external financing.
These shocks exacerbated an unsustainable fiscal expansion and led to a significant balance
of payments need (Box 1). Accordingly, the authorities have requested a blended
arrangement, comprising a Stand-By Arrangement with access of 600 percent of quota (SDR
49.2 million) over 36 months, and an arrangement under the Exogenous Shock Facility (High
Access Component), with access of 100 percent of quota (SDR 8.2 million), over 24
months.9 The ESF would help smooth adjustment to the global shocks over the next two
years, and the SBA extends over a third year to ensure that a sustainable fiscal position is
reached (Box 1). The overall access level reflects the large financing needs caused by the
exogenous shocks and the underlying fiscal imbalances, and takes into account the strong
medium-term adjustment effort.
23.
Phasing. Staff proposes an even pattern of disbursements for Fund financing under
both the SBA and the ESF (Table 7).
24.
Financing. Financing assurances from the World Bank and ADB in the amount of
US$59 million over the program period have been secured. Together with the proposed Fund
financing, these assurances would cover 100 percent of the projected residual external
financing gap over the program period. In addition, the World Bank is organizing a donor
meeting to seek further pledges from regional and bilateral sources. The additional financing
would help the economy smooth out the adjustment and build up reserves, reduce the
pressure on the private sector of increased domestic financing of the deficit, and support
public spending on capital projects. The recent allocations of special drawing rights (SDRs)
are reflected in gross and net international reserves. The authorities intend to save them to
bolster the weak reserve position.
25.
Conditionality. Program conditionality is focused on achieving the required fiscal
adjustment and monetary policy tightening, while protecting spending on the poor. The
quantitative and structural conditionality, including prior actions, are described in Tables 1–
2, attached to the authorities’ Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP).
The fiscal targets are monitored through a deficit financing performance criterion (a below9

Maldives qualifies for the ESF (the primary source of its balance of payments need is a sudden and exogenous
shock; see Box 1). Fund support for Maldives is presumed to be a blend of GRA and concessional resources,
given the country’s relatively high per capita income level. The requested access level under the ESF is
consistent with the new blending rules elaborated in SM/09/160.

23
the-line measure of the fiscal deficit), given the data limitations reported in paragraph 28.
International reserves are monitored through a target on usable reserves, a variable which the
authorities monitor regularly and which excludes encumbrances. The program allows
nonconcessional external borrowing up to US$120 million through end-2010 for socially
useful and economically viable projects, and because financing of the deficit entirely from
concessional sources is not feasible.
26.
Prior actions. All the prior actions have been implemented. The authorities have
announced and mandated reductions in salaries and allowances, as well as adjustments in
staffing levels, to reduce the government’s wage bill in line with the program. The authorities
have also raised electricity tariffs and introduced an automatic, cost-based electricity pricing
formula, as well as a subsidy mechanism for the poor. They have converted the totality of the
government’s outstanding debt to the MMA into tradable securities. The airport tax has been
transferred from the airport operator to the government. A 2010 Budget in line with the
agreed measures and targets was submitted to the Majlis in mid-November.
27.
Reviews. Quarterly program reviews will be based on quantitative performance
criteria and indicative targets assessed quarterly during the program period, and on
implementation of structural benchmarks. The first review is expected to be completed in
March 2010, based on end-December 2009 performance criteria, indicative targets and
benchmarks, while the second review is expected to be completed in June 2010, based on
end-March 2010 performance criteria and indicative targets. The authorities will consult with
Fund staff on the appropriate policy responses if there is a significant fall in usable reserves.
28.
Data issues. Monetary and financial statistics are reported on a monthly basis. Upon
request, preliminary monthly data on public expenditure and revenue have recently begun to
be produced by the authorities, but the new reporting system is as yet untested. Staff will
work with the authorities over the course of the program to improve the quality and
timeliness of data provision, including possibly through technical assistance.
29.
Capacity to repay. The government is committed to implementing the policy
program outlined in the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies. The authorities’
program represents a significant adjustment effort, and should restore Maldives’ domestic
and external stability reasonably quickly. In addition, the balance of payments need
generated by the exogenous shock is expected to ease out over the next two years (Box 1). In
particular, the tourism sector—a key source of economic activity and fiscal revenue—is
expected to recover and further expand from 2010 onwards, on the back of the global
recovery, and external financing should gradually normalize. Moreover, the Fund’s exposure
is relatively small, compared to Maldives’ external payment flows (Table 8). These factors
should give reasonable assurances of Maldives’ capacity to repay the Fund. If disbursements
are made as scheduled, there will be a peak in repayments to the Fund in 2015. Staff analysis
shows that the MMA would accumulate enough reserves to repay the Fund and maintain a
level of international reserves of more than 4 months of imports.

24
30.
Debt sustainability analysis (DSA). Maldives’ DSA indicates that the risk of distress
for external public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) debt remains moderate; also, risks to total
public debt are considerable.10 The accumulation of large current account and fiscal
imbalances in recent years has led to rapid increases in the country’s external and public debt
stocks. With the strong fiscal adjustment envisaged in the program, external and public debt
would steadily decline, and no external PPG debt burden indicators would breach their
indicative thresholds. The upward trajectory of the debt-to-GDP ratio under the historical
scenario shows that fiscal policy in the recent past was not sustainable. Going forward, the
key risks for debt sustainability are large export (tourism) shocks—which would
simultaneously affect growth and the external and fiscal positions—and fiscal policy
slippages.
31.
Safeguards. A safeguards assessment of the MMA is currently in progress and will
be completed before the first review of the proposed arrangement. The ongoing assessment
notes that there are vulnerabilities in the present external audit of the MMA conducted by the
Auditor General. The authorities have agreed to appoint an international firm to perform
MMA's audit in accordance with international standards on auditing, and to take steps to
modernize the MMA Act, strengthen its financial reporting practices, and develop its internal
audit function.
32.
Exchange restrictions and multiple currency practices. The rationing of foreign
exchange provided to the commercial banks by the MMA is forcing some current
international transactions to be conducted in the parallel market at a premium of around
10 percent over the official peg. This action by a government agency has given rise to a
multiple currency practice due to the spread of more than 2 percent between the exchange
rates in the official and parallel markets, as well as to an exchange restriction arising from the
additional premium that has to be paid in the parallel market.
VI. RISKS
33.
There are substantial risks to the program. These relate to political factors as well
as to external and domestic economic factors.

10

Additionally, external inflows to the private sector (comprising financing for privatization and tourism
projects) are treated, consistent with the authorities, as non-debt creating. The authorities do not have adequate
information to disaggregate these flows into FDI and arm’s length borrowing. To the extent that part of these
flows may be debt, the liquidity and solvency risks associated with external private debt may be higher. This
also implies that the FDI account in the balance of payments is considerably underestimated.

25


Fiscal adjustment. Resistance from civil servants or the broader public, and political
opposition, could undermine the very large budget correction as well as the tax
reforms that are key to the program’s success. This risk is heightened by the
government’s lack of parliamentary majority. Delayed or insufficient implementation
of the envisaged expenditure or revenue measures is a major risk for the program.



The global economy. The turnaround of the economy and of fiscal revenues, the
restoration of access to international market financing, the expansion of foreign direct
investment, the recovery in external inflows to the private sector (projected to sum
about 60 percent of GDP between 2009–2012, and which comprise flows to
privatization and tourism projects), depend on a reasonably solid recovery of global
economic activity, a normalization of international financial markets, and a pick up in
tourism inflows. The global economic environment entails risks both to the upside
and the downside.



Confidence. The preservation of confidence in the economy is critical for the success
of the program. The path of international reserves and the perceived sustainability of
the peg are particularly important. Approval of the program itself should help boost
confidence by boosting reserves and easing foreign exchange shortages. Nonetheless,
a sudden shift in sentiment, resulting in losses of reserves or deposit withdrawals,
cannot be ruled out.



Monetary policy. Open market operations are new in Maldives; a more stable
economic environment would have been desirable for their introduction. In addition,
even though a strong fiscal adjustment effort is being made, substantial domestic
financing requirements remain. These will compete with, and to a certain extent
crowd out, the MMA’s operations to absorb excess domestic liquidity.



Privatization. The fiscal projections reflect substantial privatization revenues in 2010
and beyond, especially from the airport (also reflected as capital inflows to other
sectors in the balance of payments). Although projections for such revenues have
been made cautiously, there is a risk that unforeseen events, including political
resistance, could postpone or derail the planned privatizations.



Financial system. If banks’ NPLs were to remain high or deteriorate further, credit
growth could remain subdued. In the case of BML, the risk to the budget could
increase.

26
34.
If any of these risks materializes to a significant extent, the policy measures in
the program would have to be reassessed.11 This would involve a reevaluation of
monetary, exchange rate, and fiscal policies, possibly including further tightening of
monetary policy and additional fiscal policies, particularly on the revenue side.
VII. STAFF APPRAISAL
35.
Overview. The global crisis has hit Maldives hard. Growth, external financing, and
budget revenues have all been adversely affected by the global economic downturn and the
international financial crisis. This, combined with an unsustainable fiscal expansion, led to
severe balance of payments pressures and put the economy on the brink of a currency crisis.
36.
Program. The authorities have committed to a very significant adjustment program,
aimed at addressing the severe impact of the global economic crisis and restoring
macroeconomic stability and fiscal sustainability, thereby setting the conditions for renewed
economic growth. In particular, they plan to: (i) bring about the large budget deficit reduction
required to restore stability and medium-term fiscal sustainability; (ii) reduce excess rufiyaa
liquidity and rebuild reserves to prudent levels; and (iii) strengthen the financial system.
37.
Fiscal policy. The core of the program is a very large fiscal adjustment, intended to
reduce aggregate demand pressures and restore fiscal sustainability. The adjustment
comprises a partial reversal of the recent large increases in the wage bill, as well as cuts in
other operational expenses and non-priority capital, complemented by revenue measures.
Given its magnitude, implementing the programmed adjustment will require the authorities’
full determination. The authorities’ program should be commended for placing the burden of
adjustment on current expenditure, while protecting the poor and keeping cuts in capital
expenditure relatively modest. The authorities’ resolve is buttressed by the fact that the
envisaged fiscal policies are consistent with structural public sector reforms that the
government intended to pursue from the outset. In addition to the fiscal policy measures
under the program, sustained efforts are needed to strengthen public financial management.
38.
Monetary policy. A shift towards a more active monetary policy is important to
complement fiscal adjustment and reduce pressures on reserves. In this regard, the recent
introduction of effective monetary policy instruments and the cessation of fiscal deficit
11

A no-adjustment scenario is presented and briefly discussed in Section II. Staff discussed with the authorities
the implications of failing to implement the necessary adjustment, as well as the emergency measures that
would be required to attempt to avert, or to deal with the consequences of, a full-blown currency and fiscal
crisis.

27
monetization represent a major step forward. The authorities are determined to pushing
forward this transition. In this they have been, and continue to be, supported by extensive
Fund technical assistance.
39.
Exchange rate policy. The authorities’ program aims to preserve the current
exchange rate regime and the peg’s current level. A balanced analysis suggests that the gains
from a devaluation, or a move to a floating regime, would be small and uncertain, while the
costs would be substantial. The envisaged fiscal adjustment and monetary policy tightening
are designed to achieve the correction in demand required to maintain the viability of the
current peg. External financing, including from the Fund, should boost confidence by
increasing reserves. Staff supports the authorities’ request for temporary Fund approval of
the exchange restriction and multiple currency practice discussed above, which have been
imposed for balance of payments reasons, are temporary, and do not discriminate against
Fund members.
40.
Financial sector policies. The program’s financial sector reform agenda addresses
the weaknesses in the system. The authorities’ willingness to explore a range of options to
strengthen BML is commendable. The MMA also needs to act decisively to ensure early
compliance by all banks with new MMA regulations on loan classification and provisioning,
as well as on foreign currency position, at the earliest possible date.
41.
Risks. While risks to the program, as outlined above, are substantial, they need to be
weighed against the benefits of Fund financial support. Those benefits are significant:
without Fund support and the additional external financing it catalyzes, the authorities’ very
large adjustment effort could be insufficient to avoid a balance of payments crisis. This
would imply a disorderly adjustment in the currency and potentially, given the economy’s
high import dependence, widespread social instability.
42.
The authorities’ program is strong, comprehensive, and well-focused, and merits
the Fund’s support. Staff recommend the approval of the requested blend arrangement,
comprising a Stand-By Arrangement and an arrangement under the Exogenous Shock
Facility.
43.
It is expected that the next Article IV consultation be held in accordance with
Decision No. 12794-(02/76), as amended.

Appendix I: Maldives: Table of Implementation of past Fund advice
Advice from the 2008 Article IV Discussions

Implementation

Adhere to zero domestic financing of the 2008 budget as
intended; identify contingent expenditure cuts in the event that
revenues do not materialize.

The authorities did not contain spending in 2008,
and revenues, in particular from land leases, fell
significantly short of budget projections.
As a result, domestic financing of the budget,
excluding proceeds from the sale of assets,
rose to 9½ percent of GDP, much of which was
monetized.

Contain the wage bill through civil service reform.

A rationalization of the civil service pay scale was
undertaken in March 2009, but this has led to
substantial increases in wages. Recently, the
government has announced cuts in wages and
allowances, and in civil service staffing levels.

Reduce subsidies to the state-owned electricity company
(STELCO), by increasing electricity
tariffs.

The authorities have raised electricity tariffs and are
introducing a cost-based formula for further price
adjustments. A transfer scheme to protect vulnerable
segments of the population is being implemented.

Enhance revenues in the medium term through the
introduction of corporate taxation, broad-based
sales tax, and an ad-valorem tourism tax.

The authorities are planning to transfer the airport tax to
the central government, and introduce an advalorem tourism tax in 2010, and a business profits tax
and a general sales tax in 2011.

Develop a medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF).

An MTEF was presented at a donors’ meeting
in May 2009. However, this will need to be
revised in light of recently announced revenue
and expenditure measures to reduce the fiscal deficit.

Pass Banking Act, AML/CFT legislation.

A draft Banking Act has been prepared with technical
assistance from the IMF, and submitted to Parliament. A
draft AML/CFT law, prepared also with IMF assistance,
has passed various review stages and will be submitted to
Parliament this year. Maldives has established a financial
intelligence unit within the MMA.

ATTACHMENT I
Malé, November 24, 2009
Mr. Dominique Strauss-Kahn
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431
Dear Mr. Strauss-Kahn:
The economy of the Maldives is facing a critical economic situation. The impact of the
global economic crisis on exports and tourism inflows, external financing, and fiscal
revenue, has exacerbated an increase in public spending by the previous administration,
and led to very large fiscal and external imbalances, and a loss of international monetary
reserves.
To address these challenges, the Government of Maldives has adopted a package of
economic policy measures for 2009-11, described in the attached Memorandum of
Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP). In support of these policies, we request a
blended arrangement with the International Monetary Fund, comprising a Stand-By
Arrangement (SBA) for SDR 49.2 million (equivalent to about US$ 78.2 million, or 600
percent of quota) for a period of 36 months, and an arrangement under the Exogenous
Shock Facility (High Access Component) for SDR 8.2 million (about US$ 13 million, or
100 percent of quota) over 24 months. We are also securing significant additional support
from other international financial institutions and bilateral partners.
The Government of Maldives believes that the policies set forth in the attached MEFP are
adequate to stabilize the economy and put it back on a path of sustainable and equitable
growth. However, if needed, the Government stands ready to take additional policy
measures to meet the objectives of our program. The Government will consult with the
Fund on the implementation of the policies contained in the MEFP, and in advance of
revisions to these policies, in accordance with the Fund’s policies on such consultation.
The Government of Maldives has authorized the publication of the attached MEFP.
Sincerely yours,

/s/
Ali Hashim
Minister of Finance and Treasury

/s/
Fazeel Najeeb
Governor, Maldives Monetary Authority

38
MEMORANDUM OF ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL POLICIES
I. BACKGROUND: RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
1.
Maldives recently experienced a peaceful transition to democracy after the
first ever multi-party presidential elections held in October 2008. The new President
Mohamed Nasheed was sworn in in November 2008, following the 30 year-rule of
President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom. One of the key objectives of President Nasheed’s
Government is to strengthen Maldives’ prospects for sustained economic growth and
consolidate the gains achieved over the last three decades in poverty reduction and human
development outcomes.
2.
While the Maldivian economy rebounded strongly from the 2004 tsunami,
propelled by tourism-related investment and public spending, the new Government
took office against a background of major economic challenges. Even before the
presidential elections, the global financial and economic crises had already started
affecting Maldives’ vitally important tourism sector from September 2008 onwards, as
reflected in the falling tourist arrivals. It also lowered the public and private sector’s
access to international credit markets, and was the primary cause of the country’s balance
of payments need.
3.
The new Government also inherited serious fiscal imbalances. The
expansionary fiscal policy of the past two years, not related to post-tsunami
reconstruction expenditures, combined with a dramatic fall in fiscal revenue since the
latter part of 2008 driven by the global downturn and its negative impact on tourism, has
led to very large budget deficits. The main source have been rapid increases in current
expenditures, particularly in salaries and wage allowances—the wage bill rose from
13 percent of GDP in 2004 to 21 percent of GDP in 2008. As provided for by the Finance
Act, the initial budget for 2009 had to be presented to Parliament by end-November,
2008, leaving no time for the new Government to reduce the unacceptably high budget
deficit. In addition, the Government had to put in place in February 2009 a wage
restructuring, including a significant rise, agreed to by the previous administration. As a
result, the fiscal deficit in the first half of 2009 was running at an annual rate of over
30 percent of GDP.
4.
Moreover, greater recourse to monetization of the deficit has increased
inflationary pressures and led to reserve losses . Large and rapidly increasing fiscal
deficits, combined with a rise in oil and food prices through mid-2008, and since late
2008 with a dramatic fall in external financing and foreign currency earnings associated
with the global downturn, have caused the current account deficit to soar and led to a loss
of usable foreign reserves down to below 1 month of imports. This forced the Maldives
Monetary Authority (MMA) to limit the amount of foreign exchange sold weekly to
commercial banks as a short-term measure to stem reserve losses and defend the fixed
peg to the US dollar, which has served economy well as a nominal anchor since 2001.
5.
The domestic economic downturn has put significant stress on the domestic
banking system. With a high exposure to the tourism sector, some banks, including the
Bank of Maldives (BML), have experienced a significant increase in non-performing

39
loans. Combined with a more difficult external financing environment, this has also
provoked stress in the foreign-currency liquidity position of some banks.
6.
The near-term outlook remains challenging. In 2009, tourism receipts are
projected to decline by around 7 percent. We anticipate real GDP to fall by up to
4 percent in 2009, dragged down mainly by a decline in tourism and related activities.
Budgetary revenues from the tourism tax and from customs duties are also expected to
fall. Assuming that the global recession starts abating in late 2009, growth for 2010
should recover to about 3½ percent, leading to a pick up in fiscal revenue. Global
economic conditions, however, are unusually uncertain, and could affect the strength and
timing of domestic recovery as well as the availability of external financing and, through
these, the health of the banking sector. Whereas lower commodity prices have reduced
inflationary pressures and should help moderate the current account deficit, a sharp
reduction in non-oil import demand would be necessary to stem reserve losses. Despite
having received substantial financial support from the Indian Government, Maldives
could have faced a severe fiscal and balance of payments crisis, unless a substantial
policy adjustment was put in place.
7.
Against this background, the Government of Maldives is committed to
implementing a policy strategy, under an IMF-supported arrangement, to restore
domestic and external stability, while protecting the poor. The key elements of the
policy program are to: (i) bring public finances on a sustainable path, including through a
continuous reduction in public debt from 2011; (ii) tighten monetary policy, including by
halting deficit monetization and conducting open market operations to absorb excess
liquidity; (iii) muster adequate multilateral and bilateral financing to smooth the path of
internal and external adjustment; and (iv) strengthen the liquidity and capital position of
the banking system. These policies to strengthen the macroeconomic position will be
complemented by broader and deeper policy and institutional reforms to improve the
microeconomic fundamentals and the investment environment by boosting productivity
growth and addressing key bottlenecks to private economic activity.
II. FISCAL POLICY
8.
Fiscal policy will aim at bringing government finances back to a sustainable
medium-term trajectory. Without corrective action, the fiscal deficit would have soared
to about 33 percent of GDP in 2009, reflecting a sharp fall in revenue and continued
spending growth. Starting with the wage restructuring announced by President Nasheed
on August 12, 2009, we have initiated a comprehensive package of reforms to not only
improve the public finances but also achieve a leaner and more efficient public sector.
These reforms aim to reduce the fiscal deficit to 29 percent of GDP in 2009, and to
18 percent of GDP in 2010. The 2010 Budget, submitted to Parliament in mid-November,
reflects the proposed fiscal adjustment measures and is consistent with the achievement of
the fiscal targets in the program.
9.
The adjustment focuses primarily on expenditure restraint. A key part of our
program, in line with the present government’s Manifesto, is to reduce the size and revise
the pay structure of the civil service. Savings will come from an ongoing restructuring of
wages, allowances and overtime payments, implemented in a progressive manner such

40
that lower earners are proportionally less affected. Effective October 1, 2009, the Civil
Service Commission (CSC) implemented a temporary reduction in civil service wages of
between 10 and 20 percent, depending on rank. This adjustment will be reversed when
central government’s domestic revenue reaches Rf 7 billion. Equivalent cuts have been
extended to non-civil service government employees. In April 2009, the Government
instructed the CSC, the Maldives Police Services and the Maldives National Defence
Force, to freeze the number of positions allowed in their institutions. In addition, we have
announced and initiated the transfer of certain services (airports, public works, schools,
hospitals) to the private sector, with the aim of improving efficiency and reducing costs.
In the case of education, this process will be complemented by scholarships for poorer
children. Transferred employees will have access to training to facilitate their
incorporation into the private sector. These transfers, together with direct redundancies to
begin this year, will significantly reduce the number of staff on government payroll by
end-2010, compared to June 2009 staffing levels. Finally, we are introducing cuts in other
operational expenses (mainly travel expenses and supplies), and postponing domesticallyfinanced, non-priority capital projects. The expected full-year impact of the expenditure
measures is Rf 2½ billion (14 percent of GDP), bringing overall central government
spending down to just over Rf 10 billion (about 55 percent of GDP) by end-2010.
10.
We will also take decisive action on the revenue side, and have already
announced important tax reforms. The aim is to broaden the overall tax base and
reduce reliance on import taxes. The airport tax has been transferred to the central
government, effective November 2009, and Parliament recently passed an amendment to
the airport tax law raising its rate by about 29 percent. We plan to introduce by end-2009
a business profit tax on all enterprises earning above a certain threshold (structural
benchmark). Also, by end-September 2010, a new ad valorem-based tourism tax to
substitute for the existing $8/per night/per person tax will be introduced (structural
benchmark). For 2011, we plan to put in place a goods and services tax (GST) (structural
benchmark). On a conservative basis, these revenue measures are expected to yield 3½
percent of GDP in 2010, with a much larger impact in later years (over 15 percent of 2009
GDP), when the full-year impact of the ad-valorem tax is felt, and the other revenue
measures come on stream.
11.
The Government is determined to support the most vulnerable sectors of the
population. Our program will protect spending on tsunami relief and social welfare
contributions, while broadening the coverage of the pension system. We are also
enhancing the targeting of food, medicine and other subsidies to the poor, including
through cuts in non-targeted transfers. In particular, starting from November 2009,
electricity subsidies have been restructured from a universal-based system to a targeted
approach. The electricity tariff has been raised and based on a cost-linked formula, but the
pricing scheme provides relief on the cost of electricity to the most vulnerable. This will
eliminate the need for central government transfers to STELCO and enable the company
to repay loans on-lent to it by the government.
12.
In line with the main tenets of its Manifesto, the Government has put in place
a privatization program, which will continue to reduce the direct involvement of the
state in production activities that can be more efficiently carried out by the private
sector. This includes the transfer of services referred to above, as well as the privatization

41
of state-owned enterprises and other assets. In particular, we have already sold a stake of
the telecommunications company for US$40 million, and plan to sell a majority of the
shares of the Maldives Airports Company, with substantial proceeds to be received over
three years. The President’s Office also set up a Privatization Committee to program the
privatization of other state-owned enterprises. Privatization receipts will provide a shortterm source of financing the deficit, while the public finances are put back on a
sustainable footing.
13.
We acknowledge that financing the large fiscal deficit, even with a significant
adjustment and with the privatization proceeds, will be challenging. However, we
have already halted the monetization of the deficit, and switched to other sources of
financing, including through t-bill and bond sales. We intend to initiate auctions of t-bills
in the primary market by the end of 2009 (structural benchmark). Additionally, we are
seeking budget support from multilateral and bilateral sources. The IMF-supported
arrangement will be complemented by direct budget support loans from the World Bank
(about US$24 million) and the Asian Development Bank (about US$35 million). We
have also secured additional external financial support, in particular further funds from
India. A donors meeting is being organized by the World Bank to secure further pledges.
14.
The fiscal adjustment measures will be complemented by actions to improve
public financial management over the medium term. We are committed to adopting
the recommendations of the recent IMF/World Bank Public Expenditure and Financial
Accountability (PEFA) assessment. A single treasury account at the MMA has been
introduced. We are completing the transition to a new Public Accounting System (PAS)
that will enhance budget execution, internal control, cash management, accounting and
fiscal reporting. We are in the process of establishing effective debt management units,
accompanied by transparent procedures on borrowing, on-lending, and the provision of
government guarantees.
III. EXCHANGE RATE REGIME AND MONETARY POLICY
15.
Since 2001, the exchange rate has been pegged to the US dollar at Rf 12.8 per
dollar. In a small, highly open economy with very limited instruments for the
independent conduct of monetary policy, the peg has provided a strong and credible
nominal anchor, while reducing transaction costs and uncertainty. The Government is
committed to reducing the pressures on the currency through a combination of strong
fiscal adjustment and monetary tightening, thus supporting the exchange rate peg at its
current level. Should usable reserves fall at any time during a given quarter by more than
a predefined amount relative to the performance criterion of the previous quarter, we will
consult with the IMF staff.
16.
We will gradually ease the rationing of foreign exchange as conditions
improve. At present, the MMA is rationing the amounts of foreign exchange it supplies
to commercial banks on a weekly basis. This practice has given rise to a multiple
currency practice and an exchange restriction subject to International Monetary Fund’s
jurisdiction. We hereby request approval by the IMF of the maintenance of the exchange
restriction and multiple currency practice under the program. We undertake not to
intensify the restriction nor modify the multiple currency practice during the length of the
Fund arrangement. As the foreign currency market stabilizes, the MMA will phase out the

42
current rationing of foreign exchange by gradually increasing the maximum amount
supplied to banks, thereby re-channeling transactions back to the formal foreign exchange
market.
17.
To support the external and internal adjustment, the MMA is focusing on
tightening monetary policy. A key step has been the halting of deficit monetization
starting in September 2009. Also, the totality of the stock of government debt with the
MMA was converted into negotiable securities with varying maturities. This has allowed
the MMA to begin conducting open market operations to reabsorb the excess liquidity
generated by years of monetizing the deficit. These operations, as well as the auctions of
government securities, will yield market interest rates. The increased volumes of
government securities should eventually facilitate the emergence of secondary markets,
including a money market, that would provide a source of liquidity for banks and the nonfinancial private sector.
18.
The Government is committed to seeking passage, by end-2010, of a set of
reforms to the MMA Act (structural benchmark). Among other things, these reforms
will strengthen the autonomy of the MMA, define its relations with the Government
(including by limiting its financing of the fiscal deficit), improve its governance and
accountability, and provide it with instruments to conduct an independent monetary
policy.
IV. FINANCIAL SECTOR POLICY
19.
The banking system is well capitalized and has long net open positions in
foreign exchange, but some of the banks are facing an increase in non-performing
loans associated with the downturn in the tourism sector. The global crisis has also
impacted banks through a reduced access to external financing. This is particularly
relevant in the case of the Bank of Maldives (BML), which, unlike the rest of the
commercial banks, is not a branch of a foreign bank and hence lacks access to the credit
lifelines that parent banks can extend.
20.
The Government of Maldives is determined to maintaining the health of the
banking system, including by strengthening BML. The MMA, together with the
Ministry of Finance and Treasury, is implementing a clear plan to address BML’s
problems. As a first step, the management of the bank has been replaced. Going forward,
the intention is to restructure its portfolio and, as required, secure a capital infusion,
possibly by attracting a strategic partner.
21.
We will expedite passage of the Banking Law (structural benchmark). In
conjunction with reforms to the MMA Act, this legislation will provide an enhanced legal
framework for the operation, supervision, regulation, intervention, and resolution of
commercial banks.
V. SAFEGUARDS ASSESSMENT
22.
We welcome the safeguards assessment currently in progress. Following on
the recommendations of a mission conducted by the IMF in October 2009, the MMA has
already taken steps to appoint an international audit firm to conduct the audit of the

43
MMA’s financial statements in accordance with international standards. The MMA is
committed to implementing the other priority recommendations of the safeguards
assessment.
VI. PROGRAM MONITORING
23.
The program will be monitored on the basis of quarterly reviews, with
quantitative performance criteria, indicative targets, and structural benchmarks.
Completion of the first and second reviews, scheduled for March 2010 and June 2010,
will require observance of the quantitative performance criteria for end-December 2009
and end-March 2010, respectively. These performance criteria are specified in Table 1.
The first review will also assess progress towards observance of the structural
benchmarks specified in Table 2. Program conditionality is further specified in the
accompanying Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU).
24.
The Government authorizes the IMF to publish this Letter of Intent and its
attachments, Tables 1 and 2.

ATTACHMENT II
Technical Memorandum of Understanding
1.
This Technical Memorandum of Understanding sets out a framework for
monitoring the performance of Maldives under the program, supported by a Stand-by
Arrangement (SBA) and an arrangement under the Exogenous Shock Facility (ESF). It
specifies the definitions for quantitative performance criteria and indicative targets, on the
basis of which Maldives’s performance under the program will be assessed through quarterly
reviews. Monitoring procedures and reporting requirements are also specified. The first
review will take place in or after March 2010 and the second review in or after June 2010.
I. QUANTITATIVE PERFORMANCE CRITERIA AND INDICATIVE TARGETS
2.
Performance criteria for end-December 2009 and end-March 2010 have been
established. The targets in Table 2 for end-June 2010, end-September 2010, and endDecember 2010 are indicative and will be converted to performance criteria at the time of the
reviews. Targets have been set with respect to:


Floor on the level of usable reserves of the MMA;



Ceiling on the level of reserve money of the MMA;



Ceiling on the level of total financing of the central government’s deficit;



Ceiling on the level of net credit of MMA to central government;



Ceiling on the contracting and guaranteeing by the central government or the MMA
of new nonconcessional external debt.



Ceiling on the accumulation of new external payment arrears of the central
government and the MMA. This performance criterion is applicable on a continuous
basis.

3.
Indicative targets for end-December 2009, end-March 2010, end-June 2010,
end-September 2010 and end-December 2010 have been established with respect to a ceiling
on the overall domestically financed expenditure by the government, excluding debt
amortization payments.
II. INSTITUTIONAL DEFINITIONS
4.

The central government includes all units of budgetary central government.

5.
The domestic banking system is defined as the MMA, the existing and any newly
licensed commercial banks incorporated in Maldives, and their branches.

47
6.
The domestic non-bank sector is defined as comprising private individuals as well as
any business or institution, private or public, that is not classified as part of the domestic
banking system.
III. MONETARY AGGREGATES
7.
Valuation. Foreign currency-denominated accounts will be valued in rufiyaa at the
program exchange rate between the rufiyaa and the U.S. dollar of Rf 12.80 per U.S. dollar.
Foreign currency accounts denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, excluding
SDRs, will first be valued in U.S. dollars at actual end-of-period exchange rates used by the
MMA to calculate the official exchange rates. SDR-denominated accounts will be valued at
the program exchange rate of U.S. dollar 1.50 per SDR. Monetary gold will be valued at
US$950 per ounce.
A. Usable Reserves of the MMA
8.
A floor applies to the level of usable reserves of the MMA. The floor on usable
reserves will be adjusted upward (downward) by the amount of external support (loans and
grants) to the government and MMA (excluding from the IMF) in excess (short) of the
programmed level.
9.
Usable reserves will be calculated as gross international reserves less international
reserve liabilities less foreign currency deposits at the MMA. For program monitoring
purposes, the stock of foreign assets and foreign liabilities of the MMA shall be valued at
program exchange rates and gold price as described in paragraph 7 above.
10.

Gross international reserves of the MMA are defined as the sum of



Monetary gold holdings of the MMA;



Holdings of SDRs;



Maldives’s reserve position in the IMF;



Cash in foreign currencies



Foreign currency assets held abroad that are under the direct and effective control of
the MMA and readily available for intervention in the foreign exchange market or the
direct financing of balance of payments imbalances and are of investment grade or
held with an investment-grade institution.

11.

International reserve liabilities of the MMA are defined as the sum of

48


All outstanding liabilities of Maldives to the IMF1; and



Any foreign convertible currency liabilities of the MMA to nonresidents with an
original maturity of up to and including one year.

12.
Foreign currency deposits at the MMA include foreign currency deposits of comme
rcial banks, state-owned enterprises and the government held with the MMA.
B. Reserve Money of the MMA
13.

A ceiling applies to the level of reserve money of the MMA.

14.
Reserve money consists of currency issued by the MMA (excluding MMA holdings
of currency), commercial banks’ deposits held with the MMA and public enterprises’
deposits held with the MMA.
C. Net Credit of the MMA to the Central Government
15.
A ceiling applies to the net credit of MMA to the central government measured
cumulatively from the beginning of the year.
16.
Net credit of the MMA to the central government is defined as the net borrowing of
the central government from the MMA (ways and means advances, loans, overdrafts,
holdings of restructuring bonds, holdings of treasury bills or other government bonds, and all
other accounts on account of the government, minus central government deposits at the
MMA).
IV. FISCAL AGGREGATES
A. Total Financing of the Central Government’s Deficit
17.
A ceiling applies to the total financing of the deficit of the central government,
measured cumulatively from the beginning of the year. The ceiling on the total financing of
the central government’s deficit will be adjusted downward by eighty percent of the amount
of total central government’s revenue in excess of the programmed levels.
18.
For the purpose of program monitoring, total financing of the central government’s
deficit is defined as the sum of (i) net domestic financing; (ii) net external financing and (iii)
privatization receipts.
1

Allocations of special drawing rights (for a total of 7,691,108 SDRs) are reflected in the capital accounts of the
MMA. The asset counterpart of these allocations (holdings of SDRs) is reflected in the gross international
reserves of the MMA. Therefore, the recent general and special SDR allocations, for a total of 7,408, 708 SDRs,
resulted in an increase in the gross international reserves and the net usable reserves of the MMA.

49


Net domestic financing is the sum of net domestic bank financing and net nonbank
domestic financing.



Net domestic bank financing is defined as the sum of: (i) net MMA credit to the
central government (defined above), and (ii) the change in the commercial banks’
claims on the central government in domestic and foreign currency, including the
change in the holdings of government securities by the commercial banks; minus the
balances of the central government held in the commercial banks.



Net nonbank domestic financing is defined as the sum of: (i) the change in the
holdings of government securities by the domestic non-bank sector, calculated as the
difference between the change in the stock or net issuance of government securities
and the change in the holdings of government securities by the banking system; and
(ii) the net change in the float. The float consists of the value of checks issued and not
yet cashed by the beneficiaries.



Net external financing is the sum, in national currency valued at program exchange
rates, of (i) the disbursements of external loans to the central government; (ii)
exceptional financing (rescheduled principal plus interest); (iii) proceeds from bonds
issued abroad; less (iv) amortization due; (v) net reduction in external arrears; and
(vi) changes in cash, deposits, and securities held for liquidity purposes outside the
domestic banking system.



Privatization proceeds are defined as the cash receipts from asset sales by the
government from abroad or domestically.

19.
For the purposes of program monitoring, total central government revenue is defined
as the sum of tax revenue and non-tax revenue, and excludes (i) subsidiary loan repayments;
(ii) government loan account repayments; (iii) the MMA revaluation account; and (iv) any
receipts from privatization.
B. Domestically Financed Expenditure by Government
20.
An indicative ceiling target applies to the central government domestically financed
expenditure, measured cumulatively from the beginning of the year.
21.
The central government domestically financed expenditure, excluding amortization
payments, is defined as actual domestically financed central government expenditure on a
cash basis, excluding amortization payments, calculated on the basis of expenditure reports
submitted by Accountable Government Agencies.

50
V. PUBLIC DEBT
A. External Debt
22.
A ceiling applies to the contracting and guaranteeing by the central government, the
MMA, or other agencies on behalf of the central government, that takes place after the
approval of the program, of new non-concessional debt of any maturity with nonresidents.
The ceiling applies to the total amounts of the debt and commitments contracted or
guaranteed after program approval, regardless of when the corresponding disbursements are
made.
23.
The definition of debt, for the purposes of the program, is set out in Executive Board
Decision No. 12274, Point 9, as revised on August 24, 2000 (see Annex I).
24.
Excluded from the ceiling are (i) the use of Fund resources; (ii) lending from the
World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and the International Fund for Agricultural
Development; (iii) debts incurred to restructure, refinance, or prepay existing debts, to the
extent that such debt is incurred on more favorable terms than the existing debt;
(iv) concessional debts; (v) any rufiyaa-denominated treasury bills and government bonds,
and MMA bills held by nonresidents; (vi) debts classified as international reserve liabilities
of the MMA; (vii) debts to restructure, refinance, or prepay existing debts; and (viii) normal
import financing. A financing arrangement for imports is considered to be “normal” when
the credit is self-liquidating.
25.
For program purposes, the guarantee of a debt arises from any explicit legal
obligation of the central government, the MMA, or other agencies on behalf of the central
government to service a loan in the event of nonpayment by the recipient (involving
payments in cash or in kind), or indirectly through any other obligation of the central
government, the MMA, or other agencies on behalf of the central government to finance a
shortfall incurred by the loan recipient.
26.
For program purposes, a debt is concessional if it includes a grant element of at least
35 percent, calculated as follows: the grant element of a debt is the difference between the
net present value (NPV) of debt and its nominal value, expressed as a percentage of the
nominal value of the debt. The NPV of debt at the time of its contracting is calculated by
discounting the future stream of payments of debt service due on this debt. The discount rates
used for this purpose are the currency specific commercial interest reference rates (CIRRs),
published by the Organization for Economic Cooperation Development (OECD). For debt
with a maturity of at least 15 years, the ten-year-average CIRR will be used to calculate the
NPV of debt and, hence, its grant element. For debt with a maturity of less than 15 years, the
six-month average CIRR will be used. To both the ten-year and six-month averages, the
same margins for differing repayment periods as those used by the OECD would continue to
be added (0.75 percent for repayment periods of less than 15 years, 1 percent for 15 to

51
19 years, 1.15 percent for 20 to 29 years, and 1.25 percent for 30 years or more). Loans
provided by a private entity will not be considered concessional unless accompanied by a
grant or grant element provided by a foreign official entity, such as both components
constitute an integrated financing package with a combined grant element equal to at least
35 percent.
VI. EXTERNAL PAYMENT ARREARS
27.
A continuous performance criterion applies to the nonaccumulation of external
payments arrears on external debt contracted or guaranteed by the central government or the
MMA. External payments arrears consist of external debt-service obligations (principal and
interest) that have not been paid at the time they are due, as specified in the contractual
agreements. However, overdue debt and debt service obligations that are in dispute will not
be considered as external payments arrears for the purposes of program monitoring.
VII. DATA PROVISION
28.
The authorities have committed to using the best available data, so that any
subsequent data revisions will not lead to a breach of a performance criterion. All revisions
to data will be promptly reported to the Fund’s Asia and Pacific Department. The likelihood
of significant data changes, including definitional changes, will be communicated to Fund
staff as soon as the risk becomes apparent to the authorities.
29.

ANNEX I. GUIDELINES ON PERFORMANCE CRITERIA WITH RESPECT TO FOREIGN DEBT
Excerpt from Executive Board Decision No. 12274, as revised on August 24, 2000
9.
(a)
For the purpose of this guideline, the term “debt” will be understood to
mean a current, i.e., not contingent, liability, created under a contractual arrangement through
the provision of value in the form of assets (including currency) or services, and which
requires the obligor to make one or more payments in the form of assets (including currency)
or services, at some future point(s) in time; these payments will discharge the principal
and/or interest liabilities incurred under the contract. Debts can take a number of forms, the
primary ones being as follows:
(i)
loans, i.e., advances of money to the obligor by the lender
made on the basis of an undertaking that the obligor will repay the
funds in the future (including deposits, bonds, debentures, commercial
loans and buyers’ credits) and temporary exchanges of assets that are
equivalent to fully collateralized loans under which the obligor is
required to repay the funds, and usually pay interest, by repurchasing
the collateral from the buyer in the future (such as repurchase
agreements and official swap arrangements);
(ii)
suppliers’ credits, i.e., contracts where the supplier permits the
obligor to defer payments until some time after the date on which the
goods are delivered or services are provided; and
(iii) leases, i.e., arrangements under which property is provided
which the lessee has the right to use for one or more specified
period(s) of time that are usually shorter than the total expected
service life of the property, while the lessor retains the title to the
property. For the purpose of the guideline, the debt is the present value
(at the inception of the lease) of all lease payments expected to be
made during the period of the agreement excluding those payments
that cover the operation, repair or maintenance of the property.
(b)
Under the definition of debt set out in point 9 (a) above, arrears,
penalties, and judicially awarded damages arising from the failure to make payment under a
contractual obligation that constitutes debt are debt. Failure to make payment on an
obligation that is not considered debt under this definition (e.g., payment on delivery) will
not give rise to debt.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND AND
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
MALDIVES
Joint IMF/World Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis under the Debt Sustainability
Framework for Low Income Countries 1
Prepared by the staffs of the International Monetary Fund and
the International Development Association
Approved by Kalpana Kochhar and Aasim Husain (IMF)
and Carlos Braga and Ernesto May (IDA)
November 25, 2009
Based on the low-income country debt sustainability analysis (LIC DSA), Maldives’ is rated to
be at a moderate risk of debt distress. Vulnerabilities for total public debt are higher, and
addressing them will require timely implementation of the authorities’ strong fiscal adjustment
program. The borrowing space in the short and medium terms has shrunk after the recent
accumulation of large fiscal and external deficits. The build-up of private external debt prior to
the onset of the global financial crisis and of public domestic debt (mainly owed to the Maldives
Monetary Authority, MMA) in the last two years has intensified the debt burden. Key risks for
debt sustainability are large future shocks to exports or fiscal policy slippages. Satisfactory
implementation of the fiscal adjustment proposed under the program would lead to a sustained
downward path in the public and external debt stocks.2
I. THE DEBT PORTFOLIO
1.
The total debt to GDP ratio has increased fast since 2004, and reached almost
110 percent of GDP in 20083. Each major category of debt has shown strong growth rates
following the 2004 tsunami. Growth in private external debt, used to finance a rapidly expanding
1

This DSA was prepared jointly by the staffs of the IMF and the World Bank. The staffs also consulted with the
Asian Development Bank. The debt data underlying this exercise were provided by the Maldivian authorities. The
fiscal year for Maldives is January-December.

2

Maldives’ policies and institutions, as measured by the World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment
(CPIA), averaged 3.53 over the past three years (2006-2008), placing it as a “medium performer.” The relevant
indicative thresholds for this category are: 40 percent for the NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio, 150 percent for the NPV of
debt-to-exports ratio, 250 percent for the NPV of debt-to-revenue ratio, 20 percent for the debt service-to-exports
ratio, and 30 percent for the debt service-to-revenue ratio. These thresholds are applicable to public and publicly
guaranteed (PPG) external debt.

In this section, total debt refers to total PPG debt (external and domestic) and private external debt.

tourism sector, has been particularly fast. An increasing fiscal deficit in the last two years has
also led to a build up of public debt, much of it domestic. With external financing sources limited
for much of 2009 and a fiscal deficit running close to 30 percent of GDP, a further build-up of
domestic debt has been observed so far this year, which largely explains the projected increase in
the total debt-to-GDP ratio to about 129 percent in 2009.

Public external debt rose rapidly after the 2004 tsunami, as donor funds flowed into
the country for reconstruction needs. It reached US$472 million (37½ percent of GDP) in 2008.
About 70 percent (or one third of the total debt stock) is from multilateral and bilateral creditors.
This fact, and the assumption that new borrowing is expected to be contracted from multilateral
and bilateral creditors throughout the projection period, motivates the use of the low-income
country (LIC) framework for the DSA.4
II. MACROECONOMIC ASSUMPTIONS
3.
Maldives is facing severe fiscal and external imbalances. For the first three years after
the 2004 tsunami disaster, the authorities pursued a growth strategy based on infrastructure
spending and expansion of tourism, financed by both official grants and loans and private sector
foreign borrowing. However, the global economic downturn has had a significant negative
impact on export and tourism receipts, as well as government revenue. Moreover, private sector
financing has contracted sharply. Combined with excessive government spending, this has led to
a growing fiscal deficit, much of which has been monetized by the central bank. To address these
challenges, the Government of Maldives has adopted a package of economic policy measures as
described in their Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP). The DSA that
follows builds on the program baseline scenario (Box 1).
4

This is the first DSA for Maldives that uses the LIC framework. Previous DSAs were conducted using the template
designed for Middle-Income Countries (MICs). Thus, no debt distress rating was previously assigned. Although a
comparison of ratings is therefore not possible, a qualitative comparison with the last DSA (IMF Country Report
No. 09/97) suggests that the risk of debt distress has increased.

3

Box 1: Main Assumptions for the Debt Sustainability Analysis (2009-2029)


Real GDP growth in 2009-14 is projected to average 2½ percent a year compared with an
average of 7¼ percent over the previous five years. Negative growth in 2009, projected at
-4 percent, is mainly due to reduced activity in the tourism sector, which has been
adversely affected by global economic downturn. Growth is expected to recover thereafter
to around 4½ percent, as global and domestic conditions improve, but to remain below the
recent historical average. This assumes that resort development takes place at a more
sustainable pace than that observed since the tsunami, and that supply constraints will
hold back the fisheries sector.



Inflation (which drives the GDP deflator) is projected to average 4¼ percent a year in
2009-14, compared with an average of 6½ percent over the previous five years, thanks to
a moderation of global prices and the fiscal adjustment effort. Inflation is expected to stay
at 3 percent thereafter, in line with trading partners’ rates, reflecting continued fiscal
consolidation and a tighter monetary policy.



Interest rates on public debt are assumed to increase to 4½ percent by 2011 (compared
with an average of 3¼ percent over the previous five years), reflecting a tighter domestic
liquidity. They are assumed to decline thereafter.



The external current account deficit (including grants) in 2009-14 is projected to
average 15½ percent of GDP a year and decline to 5 percent by 2019 reflecting a
significant fiscal retrenchment, compared to 51½ percent in 2008. Thereafter, it would
remain at below its pre-tsunami level (2003).



The overall fiscal deficit (including grants) is projected at 28¾ percent of GDP in 2009,
as the full impact of the adjustment effort will only be felt in 2010. The deficit is expected
to decline to an average of 5¾ percent of GDP in 2010-14, owing to a strong fiscal
consolidation. The budget is expected to remain in balance thereafter. As a result, the
volume of domestic borrowing will decline, although its cost may rise somewhat as the
stock of outstanding obligations from the government to the MMA are securitized at a
slightly higher average market rate than the penal rate charged by the MMA on the
government’s overdraft account. Public external debt is assumed to be contracted mainly
on concessional terms until the end of the projection period.



Government expenditures are expected to decline from 63 percent of GDP in 2008 to
45 percent by 2014, mainly reflecting civil service reforms. The government’s revenue
measures—airport tax, ad valorem bed tax, business profits tax, and the general sales
tax—are expected to yield about 15 percent of 2009 GDP once their full impact is felt.
These new taxes will partly offset steep falls in import duties, lease payments, and profits
transfers from SOEs, stemming, respectively, from the fall in public expenditure, a
moderation in future lease payments from resorts, and privatization.

4
III. EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY5
Baseline Scenario
4.
Maldives’ external debt has increased rapidly since the Tsunami, reflecting an
increase in both public external financing and private foreign-financed investment. As of end2008, PPG debt represented 49 percent of total external debt. The external debt path is expected
to worsen in the near term, as the Maldivian authorities seek external assistance to tide over the
difficult economic situation. In particular, this includes financial assistance from the Indian
government totaling US$200 million,6 and borrowing from IFIs (IMF, World Bank, and Asian
Development Bank) projected at US$146 million. The authorities are also expecting additional
nonconcessional external borrowing through end-2010.7 This borrowing explains the hump in the
path of external debt service in 2010–11. The external-debt-to-GDP ratio, however, is projected
to decline from 2010 onwards.
5.
With one minor and temporary exception, all external debt indicators remain below
the debt burden thresholds under the baseline scenario. The PV of external public debt-toGDP ratio is projected to be slightly above the 40 percent threshold this year, but trend down
thereafter as expected program implementation helps reduce the current account deficit to
sustainable levels. This marginal and temporary breach of the threshold is due in large part to the
extraordinary fiscal and current account imbalances of the past two years, which the Fundsupported program aims to address. The program also places a ceiling on non-concessional
public external borrowing going forward. All other public external debt burden indicators remain
well below thresholds throughout the projection period. While there is a hump in debt service
payments over the next two years as a result of a repayment of a large loan from the Indian
government, both debt service ratios remain well within the thresholds.
5

External debt sustainability analysis is focused on PPG external debt, to which thresholds are applicable. Private
external debt is not considered for the purpose of IDA grant allocations.

6

A credit of US$100 million was made available to the government of Maldives by the government of India in early
2009, and repayments in the tune of US$50 million in two tranches are expected to be made in 2010 and 2011,
respectively. Also, the Male branch of the State Bank of India (SBI) is expecting to contract a US$100 million twoyear non-concessional loan (subject to fifty percent rollover) from its parent by end 2009 and early 2010, and onlend it to the government of Maldives in exchange for foreign currency-denominated domestic bonds.
7

Such borrowing includes a foreign exchange swap with the Central Bank of Sri Lanka for at least US$25 million to
boost international reserves, as well as the following infrastructure and development projects: (i) the construction of
ten harbors, which has been favorably assessed by the Board of the Islamic Development Bank (IDB) and is being
financed as follows—Saudi Fund ($15 million), the IDB ($15 million), and OFID ($10 million); (ii) an
infrastructure development project (housing, sewerage, electricity, and desalination) in tsunami affected areas
funded by Abu Dhabi ($15 million); and (iii) reclamation projects and supply of equipment to be financed by loans
under negotiation. The terms of such financing vary, but are generally very favorable in relation to terms that
Maldives may have received had it sought to borrow on international or domestic financial markets.

5
Stress Tests and Alternative Scenarios
6.
Stress tests indicate vulnerability to exogenous export shocks. The PV of debt-to-GDP
ratio, debt-to-exports ratio and debt service-to-exports ratios breach the thresholds under the
most extreme standard stress test. For the former, the most extreme stress test is the combination
shock—a one standard deviation shock to growth, exports, GDP deflator and non-debt flows—
while in the latter two cases the most extreme shock is the export shock—an export value growth
at historical average minus one standard deviation in 2010–11 relative to the 2008 baseline. This
highlights the vulnerability of the economy to the variability of tourism receipts.
7.
The historical scenario indicates unsustainable debt dynamics. When key
macroeconomic variables are set to their historical averages all stock debt burden indicators
breach respective thresholds, while the debt service burden indicators show an increasing trend
after 2014. The key factor driving this scenario is the non-interest current account deficit, which
averaged 20 percent of GDP over the 10-year period to 2008. This 10-year average contains
three rather extreme events that drove the current account deficit to unprecedented highs: the
2004 tsunami, the extraordinary run-up in food and fuel prices in 2007 and 2008, and the rising
fiscal deficit of the past few years. To the extent that the magnitudes of these events can be
considered unique, the historical scenario may overestimate potential risks of debt distress.
Nevertheless, the simulations illustrate that without significant fiscal consolidation the debt path
would become unsustainable.
8.
Private external debt may increase the risks to debt sustainability. Private external
debt accounts for over one half of the external debt-to-GDP ratio. Much of this debt is at
maturities of less than 10 years, at market interest rates, and denominated in U.S. dollars. To the
extent that private external debt may increase liquidity and re-financing risks for the country as a
whole, or entail contingent liabilities for the sovereign, the risks to debt sustainability could be
higher than an analysis of external PPG data alone may suggest. Moreover, private external debt
may be underestimated in Maldives: non-FDI external inflows to the non-financial private
sector—which comprise mainly financing for privatization and tourism projects, and which sum
to about 60 percent of GDP over 2009–2012—are treated as non-debt creating in both observed
data and projections. Part of these flows, however, could be debt creating. 8
9.
In the staff’s view, the risk of public external debt distress for Maldives is moderate.
With one exception, no external debt burden indicator breaches the thresholds in the baseline
scenario. Staff judges the marginal and temporary breach in the external debt-to-GDP ratio to be
a function of the severe fiscal and current account imbalances over the past two years that the

The authorities do not have adequate information to disaggregate these flows into FDI and arm’s length borrowing.
Accordingly, the FDI account in the balance of payments may also be underestimated.

6
program aims to address.9 The steady decline in external debt burden indicators under the
program indicates that the risk of debt distress declines significantly with the proposed fiscal
adjustment. However, stress tests illustrate that the debt path is particularly vulnerable to export
shocks and decline in non-debt creating inflows, while the historical scenario shows
unsustainable debt dynamics.
IV. PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
Baseline Scenario
10.
The stock of Maldives’ nominal public debt has increased rapidly since the 2004
tsunami, from 55 percent of GDP in 2004 to around 69 percent in 2008, and is expected to reach
94 percent of GDP (including IMF loans and some transactions of financial entities) in 2009.10
This sharp increase has been driven by an expansionary fiscal policy combined with a dramatic
shortfall in fiscal revenue. Much of the fiscal deficit over the next two years has been financed
domestically, through MMA credit to the government (which in 2008 represented 75 percent of
the central government’s domestic debt and 55 percent of the total public domestic debt stock)
and sales of t-bills, held mainly by commercial banks. Total public debt service cost has
remained at an average of 7 percent of GDP a year in 2003–2008, and is expected to increase to
17.2 percent by 2010 before shifting to a downward trajectory later in the projection period.

9

Recent experience has demonstrated flexibility in rating of external debt distress (SM/09/216), including in
Mongolia (2009), Madagascar (2008), Mali (2008) and in Bhutan (2007). In the case of Bhutan, the incorporation of
two new largely debt financed hydropower projects in the baseline scenario caused some external debt indicators to
breach their thresholds in both the baseline and the alternative scenarios/stress tests. However, on account of several
country-specific mitigating factors a moderate risk of debt distress rating was retained. Other recent cases of flexible
treatment on ratings include Mongolia (2009).
10

Public debt refers here to the debt of the non-financial public sector, comprising the central government and stateowned enterprises, as well as publicly guaranteed debt. In line with inclusion of IMF debt contracted by the central
banks, it also includes a currency swap between the MMA and the central bank of Sri Lanka for $25 million
currently being negotiated. The central government accounted in 2008 for 79 percent of the total public debt. The
present value of total public debt in 2008 was 67 percent of GDP.

11.
The PV of the public debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to fall sharply under the
baseline scenario, from 91 percent in 2009 to 17 percent by 2029, owing to strong fiscal
adjustment efforts on both the revenue and expenditure sides (Table 2a). The PV of the public
debt-to-revenue (including grants) ratio would decline from a projected 252 percent in 2009 to
39 percent by 2029. The public debt service-to-revenue (including grants) ratio would increase to
28 percent by 2010 before shifting to a downward trajectory later in the projection period (Figure
2 and Table 2a). New public borrowing from all sources in the context of the program, including
Fund financing, has been considered, and risks to debt sustainability appear manageable in the
context of the programmed fiscal adjustment.
Stress Tests and Alternative Scenarios
12.
Maldives’ high level of public debt makes its sustainability vulnerable to exogenous
shocks or fiscal policy slippages. The stress tests indicate that the debt path is particularly
vulnerable to shocks to the primary balance and long term growth. If the primary deficit remains
fixed at the elevated level of 26½ percent of GDP (as in 2009), the debt ratio would continue to
expand and would reach 416 percent of GDP by 2029. This, of course, illustrates that the current
fiscal stance is not sustainable. It also points to the risks arising from insufficient or delayed
implementation of the fiscal adjustment measures envisaged in the program. Sensitivity tests also
show that the public debt path is susceptible to shocks to long-term real GDP growth, with a one
standard deviation permanent shock to growth leading to a PV public debt ratio of 124 percent of
GDP in 2029, compared with a baseline projection of 17 percent.
V. CONCLUSION
13.
Maldives faces a moderate risk of external PPG debt distress. With the exception of a
one-time breach in the PV of debt-to-GDP threshold in 2009, no thresholds are breached under
the baseline scenario, but the analysis indicates the country’s vulnerability to shocks to the
tourism sector (which are also shocks to growth), non-debt creating inflows and the primary

8
balance. This suggests the need to diversify, to the extent possible within the country’s
geographical constraints, the structure of the economy. Maldives also faces considerable risks to
debt sustainability based on its overall public debt level. This underscores the need for strong
fiscal adjustment: should the authorities fall short on their fiscal consolidation efforts, the risk of
the public and external debt ratio moving on to an unsustainable trajectory would significantly
increase.

Source: Staff projections and simulations.
1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Exchange Arrangements

From March 1, 1982 to June 30, 1985, the Maldivian rufiyaa was pegged to the
U.S. dollar. Beginning in July 1985, the exchange rate of the rufiyaa was linked to a
trade-weighted basket of currencies, but the exchange rate vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar
remained relatively stable until February 1987. On March 1, 1987, the rufiyaa was
devalued by 29 percent vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar. From 1987 to 1994, the exchange rate of
the rufiyaa was adjusted periodically. Since October 1994, the exchange rate of the
rufiyaa remained unchanged at Rf 11.77 per U.S. dollar, until July 25, 2001, when the

3
rufiyaa was devalued to Rf 12.80 per U.S. dollar. Maldives continues to avail itself of the
transitional provisions of Article XIV, and has not yet accepted the obligations Article
VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4. It maintains an exchange restriction and a multiple currency practice
subject to Fund approval under Article VIII, Sections 2(a) and 3 of the Fund’s Articles of
Agreement, arising from the MMA’s policy of rationing its supply of foreign exchange to
commercial banks. This action by a governmental agency has caused the channeling of foreign
exchange transactions for current international transactions to the parallel market at an exchange
rate that deviates by more than 2 percent from the official exchange rate (i.e., a premium of
around 10 percent over the official peg), thus giving rise to an additional cost to obtain foreign
exchange in such a market.

The 2008 Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on September 3,
2008.

Technical Assistance

FAD: In April 1994, Mr. Potter and Ms. Bédague visited Male to advise on budget
management. This was followed by periodic assistance from Mr. Webber (consultant)
over the period November 1994 to December 1995. In July 1994, Mr. Faria and
Mr. Kambil (consultant) assisted in formulating a strategy for revenue reform. This was
followed by a visit by Mr. Kambil in August/September 1995 to draft tax legislation. In
October 1996, a tax administration mission developed a strategy to establish an Inland
Revenue Department and a follow-up mission by a consultant took place in June 1997. In
May 2007, a mission conducted a diagnostic review of tax and tariff policy and
administration. In October 2008 and April 2009, a series of PFM missions provided
peripatetic support for the design and implementation of a new government integrated
financial management information system (GIFMIS). A joint mission with the World
Bank visited Male in April-May 2009 to complete a PEFA assessment.
LEG: In October 2003, Mr. Head provided assistance on the revision of the Maldives
Monetary Authority Act (MMA Act). A series of missions (March and September 2005,
and April 2006) were provided to revamp the banking law. In August 2009, a mission
provided assistance on the MMA Act (jointly with MCM).
MCM: In March 1993, a consultant provided assistance on the introduction of treasury
bills. In November 1994, a mission headed by Mr. Taniguchi provided assistance on
monetary management, foreign exchange operations, and bank supervision. In
February/June 1995, a consultant provided assistance for the development of a treasury
bill and MMA certificate market. In February/March 1996, a mission headed by
Mr. Swinburne provided advice on the reform of monetary operations and exchange
system. This was followed by a visit of a foreign exchange advisor in May 1997. In early

4
2001, two consultants provided assistance on foreign exchange and monetary
management, of two missions each. In July 2001, a consultant provided assistance on
monetary management following the lifting of credit ceilings and further impending
changes in the monetary framework. In October 2002, a multi-purpose mission took stock
of developments and provided recommendations in the areas of banking, foreign
exchange operations, and foreign exchange reserves management. In October 2003, in
cooperation with the legal consultant, Mr. Dornseif (Deutsche Bundesbank) provided
assistance on the drafting of the amended MMA Act. Two missions visited in 2006 on
monetary operations, financial market development, and banking issues. In 2007, a series
of mission were provided on debt management, monetary policy and financial
supervision. In 2008, three missions visited on monetary operations and liquidity
management, monetary policy and financial supervision issues. In November 2008 and
March/May/August 2009 a series of mission were provided on research capacity
building, bank supervision, monetary policy and the MMA act.
STA: In June 1993 and February 1994, assistance was provided on monetary and balance
of payments statistics, respectively. In May 1995, a STA consultant provided assistance
on the compilation of a new consumer price index, which was followed by further
assistance in August 1996. In November 2005, TA was given on monetary and banking
issues. In April 2006, STA provided advice on government finance statistics. In January
2007, STA provided advice on balance of payments statistics. In May 2007, STA
conducted a mission on Money and Banking Statistics.

Safeguards Assessment

A safeguards assessment of the MMA is currently in progress. The assessment evaluates
the adequacy of MMA's external and internal audit mechanisms, legal framework with
regard to financial safeguards, financial reporting practices, and systems of internal
control. The ongoing assessment notes that there are vulnerabilities in the present
external audit of the MMA conducted by the Auditor General. The authorities have
agreed to appoint an international firm to perform MMA's audit in accordance with
international standards on auditing, and to take steps to modernize the MMA Act,
strengthen its financial reporting practices, and develop its internal audit function.

ANNEX II. MALDIVES: RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP1
(As of October 2009)
The World Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy
The Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) FY08–12 aligns a joint IDA/IFC assistance
program behind the Government of Maldives’ (GoM) development strategy. The overarching
objective is to contribute to policy and institutional reforms to help maintain the country’s
successful development trajectory of the last two decades.
The CAS FY08–12 has built in flexibility, and it envisioned a midterm review in FY10. Two of
the IDA operations proposed, in mobile phone banking and pension administration were
approved by the Bank’s Board in FY08 and FY09 respectively. The strategy proposed a
programmatic, policy-based investment model for the second half of the CAS period. The
eligibility for the Maldives for IBRD funds was also to be reviewed at that time.
The CAS was prepared jointly by the World Bank and IFC and as such presents a common
view of development objectives in the Maldives, together with a commitment to a shared
strategy. During the previous CAS period, the IFC had committed a total of US$47.8 million
(US$ 46.5 million in debt and the remainder in equity), consisting of four projects in the
financial, tourism, logistics and telecommunications sectors. During the first part of the current
CAS period (2008 to June 2009) the IFC has more than doubled its commitments to about
US$103 million (or roughly twice that of IDA).
As of June 30, 2009 IFC investments spanned three sectors - tourism (72%), telecom (13%) &
financial services (15%). During the CAS period to date, IFC further increased its investment
in both the tourism and the financial sector through investments in Hotel Shangri La (US $50
million) and HDFC (US $12 million) respectively. In the financial sector, IFC’s advisory
services program (US$ 0.8 million) assisted the Maldives Monetary Authority (MMA) in
establishing and strengthening prudential guidelines (e.g. Islamic Banking) and also provided
technical assistance to help set up a Credit Bureau. Looking ahead, IFC is exploring the
possibility of extending the Global Trade Finance Program through the Bank of Maldives.
Two of IFC’s 8 investment projects (MFLC-Maldives Finance and Leasing Company and
HDFC) have an Advisory Services component. The Advisory Services component to MFLC
involves capacity building and SME finance training.
The CAS was designed to mitigate the risks that could reduce the effectiveness of the World
Bank Group’s operations and to further develop the ability to monitor the impact of
interventions. These include the immediate fiscal risks as well as the political risks due to the
1

Prepared by World Bank staff.

6
democratic transition. To mitigate these risks, the Bank Group maintains dialogue with the
authorities and with other donor partners. In addition, the Bank Group is in close dialogue with
the authorities and staff of the IMF with regard to the country’s fiscal situation. Finally, given
shallow capacity in many of the implementing agencies, there are some implementation risks.
Hence operations were to be designed simply and in close coordination with the government.
Where possible, government M&E systems were to be upgraded as part of the Bank Group’s
interventions so as to avoid the expense of developing project-specific monitoring systems.
Interventions were proposed that build on progress and relationships established by previous
operations. They also aim to establish a three pillar platform: (i) economic and fiscal
governance, (ii human development and social protection, and (iii) environmental management;
for a more long-term or programmatic approach to Bank Group assistance, as proposed by the
previous CAS, toward ensuring relevance over the next five years. Despite the short-term risks
posed by an expansionary fiscal policy, World Bank Group management committed to stay
engaged with the authorities through a program that supports the long-term growth path.
The proposed CAS program is laid out in table at the end of this annex. The CAS allowed for
the programs of FY10, FY11 and FY12 to be further elaborated during the CAS period and
reviewed as part of the CAS Progress Report (CASPR). The CASPR is currently under
preparation.
Lending and AAA program
Applying the principle of selectivity and taking into account the changing country context and
challenges facing the Maldives, the proposed World Bank Group assistance program sought to
further three strategic development outcomes: (i) a well-managed economy attracting increased
investment; (ii) increased quality of education in support of a better skilled workforce; and (iii)
improved capacity to manage the country’s pristine, but fragile, natural environment. These
strategic outcomes will be supported through IDA credits (mobile phone banking, education,
and environmental management), strategic IFC investments and TA and a flexible program of
AAA. In addition, two cross-cutting development themes were identified as essential
ingredients to the country’s overall development program. These are: building stronger
institutions and capacity to levels commensurate with the socio-economic development of the
Maldives; and decentralization.
Given the relatively small IDA allocation, making an effective contribution will mean that the
Bank Group’s work must be selective, catalytic and well-coordinated with other donors. The
CAS extends from the last year of IDA14 through the first year of IDA16.2 The overall size of
2

Under the small island exception, in recognition of exceptional vulnerability of small island states, the Maldives
has access to IDA despite having per capita income in excess of the IDA cut-off.

7
the IDA envelope during this five-year period was assumed to be about SDR 30 million (about
US$45 million). There was US$20 million available in FY08, and about $17 million (SDR
10.9 million) was allocated to the Maldives for all of IDA 15. However, it was recently agreed
that a regional re-allocation would be made which will increase the country’s IDA allocation by
about USD 10.5 million (from SDR 10.9 million to SDR 17.9 million). Therefore there are
somewhat more resources available than was anticipated in the CAS.
Given the need for policy reform in the country and the limited resources available for project
preparation and AAA, the preferred approach for IDA is to use the DPC instrument unless there
is an investment loan that can leverage additional resources. IDA is planning to employ about
half of the remaining IDA15 allocation in a DPC for FY10 that would support Government
efforts to improve its fiscal situation and meet the targets set in the IMF program. The
remaining half (about USD 12 million) will be available to fund some combination of a second
phase of the DPC, a new DPC, or new investment lending. Regarding AAA, as recommended
in the September brainstorming session, TA would be offered in a few areas, including some
where the Bank is already active.

While the IDA allocation is fixed, the mix of products is not. The World Bank Group is
working to ensure that the instruments used are consistent with the country’s development
context. In particular, a responsive program of analytical work has proved constructive in the
Maldives in the past and is consistent with the World Bank Group’s strategy for middle income
countries. In addition, the proposed sector lending program assumes that authorities manage the
current risks and avert a crisis. Development policy lending is preferable, but will be
contingent on demonstrated reforms. To this end, a DPL operation is under consideration for
FY10, and is reflected in the program table.
IFC’s focus for the remaining period of the CAS will be to further step up its work in climate
change through clean energy audits with clients and also in collaborating with the World Bank
on other areas of the climate change agenda (see below). Infrastructure will also remain a focus
area for both IFC investment and advisory work especially in supporting the government’s
privatization agenda through advisory work on setting up PPPs. IFC will also be working to
respond to the Government’s request to help with exploring opportunities to expand financing
to SMEs, and also to support student loans, in the coming years.
The teams of the IMF and other IFIs have been working closely with the World Bank’s macro
and fiscal team.

ANNEX IV. MALDIVES—STATISTICAL ISSUES
As of October 27, 2009
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance.
Macroeconomic statistics have improved in recent years, with technical assistance from STA
and the Asian Development Bank (AsDB). Remaining shortcomings affect the balance of
payments, government finance, and national accounts statistics. The main official statistical
publication is the Statistical Yearbook of Maldives, which contains data series up to 2004.
APD receives a monthly electronic statistical report, covering a broad range of economic and
financial statistics. It also receives, albeit with a lag, the Quarterly Economic Bulletin (QEB)
and the Annual Report(AR) of the Maldives Monetary Authority (MMA).
Real sector: National accounts statistics are available only on an annual basis and with a
considerable lag; while GDP estimates are made using both the production and expenditure
approaches, these estimates are inconsistent. Furthermore, the base year for constant price
estimates is 1995, so that recent changes in the structure of the economy are not reflected by
the base period weights. The AsDB is assisting the authorities in setting up a framework for
compiling more comprehensive national accounts.
Recently, the CPI has been rebased to June 2004=100, with assistance from the AsDB.
Weights are based on the household income and expenditure survey that was conducted
between September 2002 and June 2003 and adjusted for price changes up to June 2004.
Fiscal sector: General government data are reported for publication in the GFS Yearbook
and the latest published data are for 2008. Monthly data on revenue and expenditure are
available, but the reporting system is new, and its reliability is as yet untested. In particular,
the consistency of these data with below-the-line financing numbers provided by the
monetary authorities is weak. Data on external debt are subject to reconciliation with
creditors. Data on the operations of state enterprises are limited.

Monetary sector: APD receives a weekly electronic report on monetary statistics, covering
the balance sheets of the MMA and the commercial banks. Current summary data are
published in the MMA’s Monthly Statistics publication as well as in its QEB and AR, but
with a significant lag. There are inconsistencies between monetary and fiscal data regarding
the financing of the fiscal deficit due to issues of timing and coverage. An April 2007 STA
monetary and financial statistics mission completed the standardized report forms for the
central bank and other depository corporations, and developed an integrated monetary

12
database that meets the needs of the MMA, STA, and APD, which is expected to become
operational shortly. It is expected that a new call report form to obtain balance-sheet data for
other financial corporations will be introduced with the assistance of a follow-up mission.
External sector: MMA compiles balance of payments data on an annual basis. There are
problems of coverage and measurement in a range of areas. Travel credits (receipts) are still
estimated on the basis of a small, outdated, survey of resorts/hotels. Coverage of foreign
direct investment firms is limited, leading to underreporting. Estimates of distributed and
reinvested earnings of direct investment enterprises in the tourism sector remain
unsatisfactory, and information on private financial flows is incomplete. Data on the
international investment position are incomplete as private sector data are not available.
Quarterly data on external debt and debt service are available for the government and the
monetary authority, and to some extent for the banking sector and state enterprises at the
time of the annual consultation missions, but no data are reported for the nonfinancial private
sector. A STA technical assistance mission in January 2007 proposed steps to improve data
on direct investment, travel receipts, and a range of other specific items.
Official reserves assets are reported weekly with a (variable) one-week lag. Predetermined
foreign currency outflows (mainly debt service payments) are known and reported to APD at
the time of annual Article IV consultation missions, while other movements of foreign
currency assets are not identified.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Maldives does not participate in the General No data ROSC available.
Data Dissemination System (GDDS).
III. Reporting to STA (Optional)
The authorities report macroeconomic data to the Fund on a regular and generally timely
basis for publication in the IFS, BOPSY, and GFSY.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes Article IV Consultation
with Maldives
On December 4, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Maldives.1
Background
The Maldivian economy rebounded strongly from the 2004 tsunami disaster on the back of
high tourism-related investment and large increases in public spending. However, the global
financial crisis hit Maldives hard through steep declines in tourism (tourist arrivals fell by 8¾
percent in the year to August 2009), exports of goods, and the availability of external
financing. As a result, real GDP is expected to fall by about 4 percent in 2009.
Import prices, particularly for food and fuel, have been driving inflation. After picking up
sharply to 8½ percent year-on-year (y/y) in 2008 due to soaring commodity prices, inflation
has declined rapidly in the first half of 2009, to 3 percent y/y in August, but is expected to
rebound somewhat in the latter part of the year.
The fiscal deficit rose to 13¾ percent of GDP in 2008, reflecting rapid increases in current
expenditures, particularly in the wage bill, combined with a fall in tourism-related revenue in
the second half of 2008, driven by the global downturn. In 2009, additional increases in
salaries and wages have driven up spending, while revenues have weakened further as the
global crisis unfolded. Without policy action, the fiscal deficit would have reached 33 percent
of GDP in 2009.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of
the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
In 2008, the rapid fiscal expansion, soaring import prices, and lower earnings from tourism
led Maldives’ external current account deficit to widen to 51½ percent of GDP in 2008. In
2009, the reduced availability of foreign financing has led to continued reserve losses,
prompting the MMA to ration foreign exchange. Combined with the domestic slowdown and
lower import prices, these factors have resulted in a very sharp import contraction, more
than offsetting the decline in tourism inflows. The current account is thus expected to
narrow significantly in 2009, to about 30 percent of GDP.
The fixed exchange rate regime has provided a clear and effective nominal anchor. The real
effective exchange rate has appreciated recently, but remains below historical averages,
and its trajectory has actually remained below that of the indices for relevant competitors.
Excess money supply from deficit monetization and the decline of capital inflows have
resulted in reserve losses and the rationing of foreign exchange supplied by the Maldives
Monetary Authority to the banking system. As a result, a parallel market has emerged with a
small premium over the official peg, and gross international reserves stood at 2¼ months of
imports at end-September, 2009. The introduction, in August 2009, of open market
operations, and the cessation of deficit monetization, will help reduce excess liquidity and
alleviate pressures on the exchange rate.
The banking system has been hit by the reduced availability of external financing and the
domestic economic slowdown. Non-performing loans have increased significantly, as banks
have a high exposure to the tourism sector. Banks have ample domestic liquidity and long
net open positions in foreign exchange. However, they are still vulnerable to dollar liquidity
shocks. The difficult economic and financing conditions, and the deteriorating portfolio, have
led y/y private sector credit growth to shrink by 2 percent in August 2009, after several
years of very high growth rates.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that the Maldivian economy has been severely hit by the global
crisis through a fall in tourism inflows, external financing, and exports. Coming atop a period
of unsustainable fiscal expansion—partly reflecting post-tsunami reconstruction efforts—
these shocks exacerbated the fiscal and external imbalances, weakened the reserve
position, and pushed the economy into recession. They also put considerable stress on the
banking sector. While economic activity and fiscal revenues are expected to improve in the
next few years, the external economic environment remains fragile. Against this
background, Directors supported the authorities’ program, aimed at restoring
macroeconomic stability and medium-term sustainability through fiscal and monetary
tightening, shoring up reserves, and strengthening the banking sector. They welcomed the
significant steps recently taken by the new government.
Directors underscored that determined fiscal consolidation is critical to the success of the
program. They supported the authorities’ commitment to restore fiscal sustainability through
a very significant adjustment. In light of already high public debt levels, it will be crucial to
reduce the central government’s deficit decisively—including by pressing ahead with the
program’s expenditure and revenue measures and saving most of any revenue
over-performance. Directors welcomed the emphasis on adjustments in remuneration and

3
staffing levels, which are necessary to unwind part of the large wage increases in recent
years and to streamline the civil service. They also welcomed the increase in electricity
tariffs in line with a new cost-based formula. Directors supported the authorities’
commitment to protecting social spending and improving the targeting of subsidies,
including the replacement of across-the-board electricity subsidies with targeted relief for
the poor. On the revenue side, they encouraged the authorities to move expeditiously to
pass the needed tax reforms. Continued improvements in public financial management are
also essential.
To complement fiscal consolidation and stem reserve losses, Directors stressed the need to
tighten monetary policy. They welcomed the authorities’ considerable progress in this area,
including the cessation of deficit monetization, the conversion of the government’s debt with
the Maldives Monetary Authority into negotiable securities, and the introduction of open
market operations to absorb excess rufiyaa liquidity.
Directors generally agreed that the fixed exchange rate regime has served as a nominal
anchor for the Maldivian economy. They stressed that external sustainability and the
sustainability of the current level of the peg are conditional on the implementation of the
fiscal adjustment under the program and on continued progress on monetary tightening.
Directors supported the authorities’ commitment to building up foreign exchange reserves
and phasing out the rationing of foreign exchange as conditions improve.
Directors called on the authorities to remain vigilant to developments in the banking system.
They welcomed the authorities’ resolve to improve financial sector regulation and
supervision, including by passing the needed legislative reforms, and to strengthen the
financial position of the banking system. Directors encouraged the authorities to enforce the
implementation of recent regulatory changes on provisioning and asset classification, and to
adopt regulations to limit banks’ open foreign currency positions.
Directors encouraged the authorities to improve the quality and timeliness of data reporting
to the Fund, with Fund technical assistance.
Directors stressed that the significant risks to the program—including those related to the
implementation of the very large fiscal adjustment—heighten the importance of strong
ownership, consensus building, and resolute policy implementation by the authorities. Close
collaboration with the Fund, including through continued technical assistance, as well as
strong support by the international community will also be important to ensure the success
of the authorities’ ambitious policy efforts. Directors emphasized the need to consider
contingency measures to allow for prompt remedial action should any risks materialize.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
December 4, 2009

International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Approves US$79.3 Million Stand-By Arrangement and
US$13.2 Million Arrangement Under the Exogenous Shocks Facility for Maldives
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today approved blended
financing arrangements for Maldives amounting to a combined SDR 57.4 million (about
US$92.5 million). The financing is designed to help smooth the country’s adjustment to the
fallout from the global crisis and support the authorities’ strong policy program.
The blended arrangements for Maldives include a 36-month, SDR 49.2 million (about
US$79.3 million) Stand-By Arrangement (600 percent of Maldives’ quota), and a 24-month,
SDR 8.2 million (about US$13.2 million) arrangement under the Exogenous Shocks Facility
High Access Component (ESF-HAC, 100 percent of Maldives’ quota). The ESF-HAC is an
IMF facility designed to provide policy support and financial assistance on concessional
terms to eligible low-income countries facing temporary exogenous shocks.
A combined disbursement of SDR 5.13 million (about US$8.3 million) will become available
under the arrangements following the Board’s decisions.
Following the Executive Board discussion, Mr Takatoshi Kato, Deputy Managing Director
and Acting Chair, issued the following statement:
“The Maldivian economy was severely hit by the global crisis through significant declines in
Maldives’ tourism receipts, capital inflows, and goods exports. Coming after unsustainable
public spending over the last few years—partly reflecting post-tsunami reconstruction
efforts—the crisis led to a very large fiscal deficit, a sharply weakened balance of payments
position, and reserve losses.
“The government’s ambitious policy program, supported by the IMF, is aimed at addressing
the impact of the global economic crisis and restoring macroeconomic stability and fiscal
sustainability. At the core of the program is a very strong effort to bring down the fiscal
deficit while protecting social spending. To that end, the authorities are taking immediate

2
action to cut spending, including unwinding part of the recent large wage increases, and are
introducing new revenue measures to broaden the tax base. They have also taken steps to
reform the civil service, improve the targeting of subsidies to the poor, and transfer
enterprises and services to the private sector.
“The program aims to rebuild international reserves to prudent levels while preserving the
current exchange rate peg to the U.S. dollar. Monetary policy will support the fiscal
adjustment efforts through a tightening of domestic currency liquidity. The authorities have
taken key steps in this regard: the monetization of the fiscal deficit has been halted; the
government debt stock with the Maldives Monetary Authority has been converted into
tradable securities; and open market operations have been introduced to absorb excess
liquidity.
“The authorities are committed to strengthening the financial sector. These measures include
restructuring the Bank of Maldives’ portfolio; ensuring speedy action for the recovery of its
collateral on defaulted debt; and, as necessary, securing a capital infusion. The authorities
also plan to put in place a stronger legal framework for the operation, supervision, regulation,
intervention, and liquidation of commercial banks, and have already introduced regulatory
changes to enhance asset classification and loan loss provisioning.
“The authorities’ program, while subject to considerable risks, is strong, comprehensive, and
well-focused, and deserves strong support of the international community. If fully
implemented, it will put the Maldivian economy back on a path of macroeconomic stability
and set the conditions for sustained economic growth and poverty reduction,” Mr Kato said.

3
ANNEX
Recent Economic Developments
The Maldivian economy is facing severe fiscal and external imbalances. A rapid fiscal
expansion began after the 2004 tsunami, including steep wage bill increases. From mid-2008,
the global crisis significantly exacerbated existing imbalances and severely weakened the
country’s balance of payments position. Tourism revenue has been badly affected by the
global downturn, reducing fiscal and foreign exchange earnings and driving the economy
into recession. Net capital inflows have also fallen sharply, as have goods exports. The loss
in fiscal revenues, combined with the continued growth in public expenditures, led to a
dramatic increase in the fiscal deficit in 2008-09, much of which has been monetized.
Despite foreign exchange rationing by the Maldives Monetary Authority (MMA),
international reserves had fallen to about 2¼ months of imports by end-September 2009.
Key Program Policies and Objectives
The authorities are undertaking a very significant adjustment program, aimed at addressing
the severe impact of the global economic crisis and restoring macroeconomic stability and
fiscal sustainability, thereby setting the conditions for renewed economic growth and poverty
reduction. In particular, they plan to:
• Reduce the very large budget deficit by curtailing spending and implementing revenue
measures, in order to restore economic stability and fiscal sustainability;
• Protect critical social spending and broaden the coverage of the pension system. The
targeting of food, medicine and other subsidies to the poor will also be enhanced. For
instance, across-the-board electricity subsidies have been eliminated and replaced by a costbased electricity pricing formula combined with a subsidy mechanism for the poor;
• Reduce excess liquidity of the Maldivian rufiyaa and rebuild reserves to prudent levels; and
• Strengthen the financial system.

MEMORANDUM ITEMS

Statement by Mr. Shaalan on Maldives
December 4, 2009
1.
Overview. The administration of President Mohamad Nasheed that took office in
November 2008 faced an urgent policy challenge as the economy was particularly hard hit by
the global financial crisis. The crisis exacerbated the impact of the recent fiscal pressures by
severely curtailing foreign exchange earnings and net capital flows, leading to a rapid
drawdown in foreign exchange reserves and a sharp drop in government revenue by nearly
one third relative to 2007. The post-Tsunami relief efforts and reconstruction projects had
supported strong growth while contributing to enlarging the size of the public sector between
2004 to 2007. Public expenditure was also inflated to unsustainable levels in the run-up to the
October 2008 elections, reflecting a rising wage bill partly due to the newly introduced civil
service reform.
2.
The ruling party’s manifesto for 2008-2013 foresaw the need to “plan state
expenditure in proportion to government income and reduce wasteful and excessive
spending”1. The onset of the global financial crisis made such reforms all the more urgent as
international reserves approached a critical level. While there was no time to adjust the 2009
budget before its scheduled submission to Parliament in mid-November, the government
approached the Fund in its first few weeks in office to assess the situation and discuss
policies that would return the fiscal and external positions to sustainable levels. Support from
bilateral creditors and private investors was also sought for interim foreign exchange until
multilateral creditor financing can be secured in support of an adjustment program.
3.
Request for Fund resources. In close collaboration with the Fund, the authorities
prepared an ambitious and comprehensive program to restore macroeconomic stability and
growth. The access level of 600 percent of quota under the three-year Stand By Arrangement
and 100 percent under the 2-year ESF is the highest level of “normal” access, amounting to
SDR 57.4 million over 36 months. In order to soften the severe impact of the shock and
smooth the adjustment path, the authorities had initially requested higher exceptional access,
arguing that the tremendous size of the adjustment justified higher financing to ease the
impact on domestic growth and to help bolster reserves to a comfortable level consistent with
the Maldives’ high vulnerability to external shocks. Moreover, higher access would lower
risks to the program and support its successful implementation.
4.
International support. To supplement financing from the IMF, the authorities have
secured financing from the World Bank and AsDB for about $59 million. They have also
approached the Government of India for a 2-3 year dollar-denominated bond of $100 million;
in addition to the $100 million trade credit contracted earlier in 2009, and have been

discussing a swap agreement with the Government of Sri Lanka. A $40 million stake in the
state telecommunications company also provided interim foreign exchange. The authorities
intend to request additional concessional support from the international community at a
conference to be organized by the World Bank. Such additional support would facilitate
economic recovery and reserve buildup, ease the pressure on the private sector of increased
domestic financing of the deficit, support public spending on capital projects, and facilitate
repayment of short-term borrowing. Depending on the outcome of the donor meeting, and the
pace of the global recovery and resumption of capital flows, the authorities may seek
augmentation of access in conjunction with successful implementation of the fiscal
adjustment measures.
5.
Tsunami legacy. Although the country made a remarkable recovery to the Tsunami,
the reconstruction efforts bloated the size of public sector and sharply increased debt as the
government attended to the damage that the World Bank estimated at 65 percent of GDP.
The reconstruction process was long drawn out as Tsunami-related aid was disbursed over
several years, and about 85 percent of affected housing and physical infrastructure had been
restored by end 2008.2 Government expenditure increased from 36 percent of GDP in 2004 to
61 percent of GDP in 2007 as the number of permanent government employees increased by
24 percent, primarily due to public take-over of all private schools and expansion of health
facilities. Similarly, the trade deficit nearly doubled following the Tsunami and the current
account deficit rose from 16 percent in 2004 to 33 percent in 2006. Rising oil and food prices
in 2007, as well as increased imports of construction materials, further pushed the current
account deficit to over 40 percent of GDP in 2007 and over 50 percent of GDP in 2008,
creating an untenable drain on foreign exchange reserves. As a result, total debt to GDP
increased from 55 percent of GDP in 2004 to 91 percent of GDP in 2008.
6.
Civil service reforms. A Civil Service Commission (CSC) was established in 2007
and a Civil Service Act adopted in March 2008. Consistent with a U.N.-supported study to
modernize the civil service and rationalize the pay scale, the CSC recommended reforms to
introduce job classifications, a 12 percent pay dispersion between grades, and equalize pay
for similar work in various government offices. A new civil service salary structure was
introduced in late 2008. Moreover, in the run-up to the October 2008 presidential elections,
the previous administration promised pay increases to specific sectors of about 20 percent.
To address equity concerns, the new administration agreed to extend the increases to all
sector in conjunction with introduction of the new civil service pay structure to become
effective on February 1, 2009. This came on top of a public sector wage increase in January
2008 that was necessitated by the erosion of real incomes due to higher commodity prices
and weakening of the rufiyaa. Together, and in the absence of corrective measures, these

Planning, Ministry of Finance and Treasury.

3
policies would cause the wage bill to increase from 16.3 percent of GDP in 2007 to 29.1
percent of GDP in 2009, an unsustainable level.
7.
The policy of the current government is to have a lean and efficient civil service and
to reduce the number of public employees accordingly. Recognizing the detrimental impact
of the recent civil service policies on fiscal imbalances, the President announced in August
2009 a partial reversal of the February salary increase and elimination of most allowances.
The salary reductions were implemented starting in September 2009, yielding 4 percent of
GDP on an annual basis. However, initial plans to roll back allowance payments could not be
implemented. The Civil Service Commission ruled against elimination of allowances,
insisting that further reductions in take home pay would only be considered once the salary
cuts were reversed– this outcome delayed program negotiation. As an alternative measure to
reduce the public wage bill, the President brought forward the retrenchment program,
requiring elimination of 9,000 government positions through restructuring of government
offices and a rapid transfer of government services to the private sector by mid-2010. This
would effectively reduce the public wage bill from 29 percent of GDP in 2009 (before the
salary reductions) to 17½ percent of GDP by 2011.
8.
Program objectives and macroframework. The program aims to restore external
balance and fiscal sustainability primarily through a sharp fiscal adjustment over two years,
consistent with maintaining the current exchange rate peg. Growth is expected to resume in
2010 to around 4 percent as tourism receipts and tourism-related investments rebound, driven
by the recovery in the global economy and resumption of capital flows. Government revenue
is expected to partially recover to its 2007 level, and together with the sharp reduction in
expenditures, the primary balance is targeted to turn positive by 2011 and the overall deficit
is to fall to 1 percent of GDP by 2014. The current account deficit will narrow drastically in
the coming years, as imports remain subdued, contained by the fiscal and monetary
tightening, allowing gross international reserves to be maintained at 3-4 months of imports.
9.
Fiscal adjustment. The programmed fiscal adjustment is sizeable—the fiscal
measures under the program are expected to yield full year savings of 29 percent of GDP
when fully implemented by 2012 (as outlined in the table on page 17). The fiscal adjustment
falls equally on expenditure and revenue mobilization, but with more immediate effect on the
expenditure side. Total government expenditure would have reached 67.6 percent of GDP in
2009 without corrective measures, and will by slashed by 12½ percentage points to under 55
percent of GDP in 2010. These savings will come from wage cuts (4 percent), staff
redundancies (3 percent), electricity tariff increases (2½ percent), reduction in transport and
office expenses (2 percent) and lower capital spending (1 percent). The full-year impact of
the all expenditure measures amounts to 14 percent of 2009 GDP, when fully implemented.
In addition to the expenditure cuts, revenue measures will yield another 3½ percent of GDP
in 2010 from a transfer of the airport tax to the government together with an increase in its
rate, switching the $8 per night fixed rate to an ad valorem hotel room tax, and introduction
of a business profit tax to be passed by Parliament by end 2009. In the following two years,

4
2011-2012, the further fiscal consolidation will rely on the introduction of a general sales tax
from 2011. The full year impact of all revenue measures amount to 15 percent of 2009 GDP,
when fully implemented.
10.
The magnitude of such fiscal adjustment is clearly unprecedented in Fund programs,
and we must not underestimate the enormity of the challenge facing the new administration
in pushing through these painful reforms. Altogether, fiscal measure amounting to 29¼
percent of GDP are expected over the course of the program. The sheer magnitude of the
adjustment is likely to engender public outcry. Nevertheless, the authorities are fully
determined to implement the agreed measures, emphasizing that the envisaged fiscal policies
are consistent with the structural public sector reforms they intended to pursue from the
outset (as noted above), even if the pace is considerably more challenging than had been
originally envisaged.
11.
Monetary policy. Several steps have been taken to alleviate the burden of fiscal
financing on the conduct of monetary policy and to stem reserve losses. Most important is the
government’s decision to cease the monetization of the fiscal deficit and to convert the
government debt stock held by the Maldives Monetary Authority (MMA) into tradable
securities to reverse the impact of past monetization on liquidity. Open market operations
were introduced in August 2009. Domestic financing through direct monetization is to be
replaced by treasury bill auctions, scheduled to begin by December 2009.
12.
Exchange rate policy and competitiveness. The significant fiscal and monetary
tightening aims to support the current peg, whose level the staff and authorities consider to be
appropriate and consistent with the envisaged fiscal consolidation. As well-argued in the
staff report, a devaluation would not be appropriate in the current circumstances due to the
small scope for expenditure-switching, large pass-through effect on domestic prices, and high
confidence risks that could invite speculation in the context of low reserves. Moreover, as
staff analysis clearly indicates in Box 2, the economy remains competitive at this exchange
rate when compared to other tourism-dependent economies, and competitiveness could be
further improved by addressing some structural weaknesses related to the business climate.
Due to the mounting pressures on reserves which had reached a precariously low level, the
authorities have been rationing foreign exchange to commercial banks, which has given rise
to multiple-currency practices. However the authorities are committed to gradually
eliminating this practice over the program period as reserves build up.
13.
Financial sector policies. Significant progress has been achieved in financial
regulation and supervision, and ongoing efforts aim to address remaining weaknesses.
Benefiting from MCM and LEG advice, a banking law and reforms to the MMA Act have
been presented to the parliament, and regulations were introduced in May 2009 to strengthen
the prudential framework. The new regulations include tighter capital adequacy
requirements, limits on loans to related persons and single borrowers, asset classification and
provisioning, audit and disclosure requirements, and corporate governance. The authorities

5
are pressing ahead for recovery of collateral on defaulted loans for the Bank of Maldives, the
largest commercial bank. Their intention is to secure capital infusion, preferably in the
context of a strategic partner to take over the state share in the bank.
14.
Structural reforms. As noted earlier, the authorities’ policy for state reform aims to
make the public sector leaner and more efficient, including by transferring services that can
be more efficiently provided by the private sector and through the sale of public enterprises.
The government’s retrenchment plan will reduce the public work force by privatizing
services. In addition to selling a stake in the telecommunication company, the Privatization
Committee has been working on privatization of the airport and other enterprises. Significant
strengthening of public financial management is underway, with FAD support, aimed at
improving budget planning, control, monitoring, and implementation. A key challenge in the
period ahead will be to prioritize the vast legislative agenda, which includes over 80 bills
before Parliament. Public sector reforms and privatization are part of a larger effort to
improve the business climate in order to foster a dynamic more diversified private sector and
to strengthen the economy’s resilience to shocks.
15.
Debt sustainability. Maldives’ total debt (public and private) increased rapidly since
the 2004 Tsunami, reaching almost 110 percent of GDP in 2008 and resulting in a rating of
moderate risk of debt distress. However, with one minor and temporary exception, all
external debt indicators remain below the relevant LIC debt burden thresholds under the
baseline scenario, as the fiscal adjustment embedded in the program will bring down
significantly the debt to GDP ratio. Indeed, even a more gradual path of fiscal consolidation
would be consistent with a sustained downward path in the public and external debt stocks.
16.
Finally, the authorities would like to express their appreciation for the staff’s valuable
analysis and policy advice and for the Fund’s helpful technical assistance, which have been
instrumental in the formulation and implementation of their reform effort. They consider
continued technical assistance of paramount importance to implementing this ambitious
reform program. While they had sought a smoother path of adjustment and higher financing
from the Fund, they look forward to continued close collaboration as they implement this
arduous program in the months and years ahead.
