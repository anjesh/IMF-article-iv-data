EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Economic Developments
•
Bold and wide-ranging reforms, supportive macroeconomic policies, and a favorable
external environment have contributed to macroeconomic stability and higher growth and
employment. While the external sector remains an important engine of growth, the economic
expansion has become more broad-based. The balance of payments has been bolstered by
capital inflows. Foreign debt and external vulnerabilities remain low.
•
Significant progress in the government’s reform program has taken Egypt further
along the road to a full market economy. The privatization program has gained momentum,
the restructuring of state-owned banks is progressing, and trade reforms are continuing. The
authorities continue to strengthen monetary policy operations and have implemented a
number of important reforms in the fiscal area, including implementing a major income tax
reform and improving revenue administration.
•
Inflation fell sharply in 2005 and real interest rates turned positive. The transparency
of public finances has improved considerably with the preparation of a revised set of fiscal
accounts. However, public debt is high and the fiscal deficit remains large; the expected
improvement in 2005/06 largely reflects exceptional revenues.
Policy Issues
•
Generating sustained economic growth, and thereby creating jobs, is the overriding
policy objective in Egypt. Private sector investment will need to play a key role in this
regard. To reduce unemployment, the economy will need to grow at sustained rates of at least
6 percent, for which investment will have to reach about 25 percent of GDP.
•
The authorities outlined a multi-year fiscal consolidation package aimed at bringing
the deficit down by at least 1 percent of GDP annually for five years. This fiscal adjustment
is welcome, although more ambitious targets would more decisively reverse debt dynamics
in the coming years. The regulatory environment needs to be further liberalized and the
financial sector strengthened to accelerate private sector development and job creation.
•
The current stance of monetary policy is broadly neutral, and additional interest rate
reductions should wait until liquidity growth decelerates. In the run-up to the planned
adoption of formal inflation targeting, the authorities should further enhance central bank
operational autonomy and strengthen policy formulation.
•
Egypt has adopted a managed float exchange rate regime since 2004, although de
facto the Egyptian pound has remained very stable vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar over the last 15
months. There is scope to enhance the role of market forces in determining the exchange
rate; however, for competitiveness reasons, the central bank could continue to lean against
exchange rate appreciation driven by transitional capital inflows (e.g., privatization) until
ongoing structural reforms translate into tangible productivity gains.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Economic conditions in Egypt are favorable and the economic reform program
is moving forward. A new cabinet led by Prime Minister Ahmed Nazif, first appointed
in 2004, was reappointed in December 2005 following parliamentary elections. The
economic team was also reinstated, reaffirming the government’s commitment to economic
reform. The election resulted in a parliamentary majority for the ruling National Democratic
Party, with members of the Muslim Brotherhood—who ran as independents—winning
about 20 percent of the seats in parliament.
2.
The government’s reform program since 2004 has been addressing most of the
areas regarded as critical in recent Article IV consultations, often involving Fund
technical assistance. During 2005, the authorities made substantial progress in the areas of
tax reform, public finance management, monetary policy, privatization, and financial sector
restructuring. However, the Fund has stressed the need for ambitious fiscal adjustment,
which the authorities recognize and accept.
3.
Investor confidence in the direction of economic policy remains high. The reform
progress achieved to date has raised and improved Egypt’s profile in international capital
markets. Foreign direct investment and inward portfolio flows have risen sharply. Economic
growth has accelerated and the balance of payments remains robust. Intermittent security
incidents add some downside risk to the economic outlook, but their impact so far has been
relatively minor and short-lived.
4.
Increasing growth on a sustained basis is the biggest priority for policymakers.
In this regard, the government is moving ahead with the next phase of reforms intended to
address the structural impediments to higher growth and job creation, notably, large fiscal
deficits, unproductive public expenditure, red tape, deficiencies in financial intermediation,
and labor market rigidities. These reforms pose difficult socio-political challenges, and will
require broad political consensus to implement.
5.
While the authorities face a broad range of policy challenges and have developed
a comprehensive reform agenda to tackle them, the Article IV discussions focused on
the elements of a macroeconomic policy mix that would best support the authorities' main
policy objectives. Specifically, staff discussed with the authorities: (i) a multi-year fiscal
consolidation plan; (ii) the monetary policy stance and strategy appropriate for maintaining
inflation in low single-digits; (iii) exchange rate policy; and (iv) progress in financial sector
reform.

external sector remains an important engine of growth, but the expansion has become more
broad-based, with construction and services now increasing at a healthy rate. Privatization
in 2005/06 (fiscal year ending June 30) has exceeded expectations (Box 1), and reforms in
the fiscal area have prepared the groundwork for fiscal consolidation going forward.
After a slowdown from 2000-03,
economic growth has been rising
towards regional average rates.

7.
Notwithstanding the continued economic recovery, labor force growth exceeded
employment growth in 2005. The official unemployment rate peaked in September 2005
near 12 percent, before falling slightly in December. The labor market is characterized by an
excess supply of labor, particularly among the youth, a serious mismatch between the skills
required and those furnished by the public education system, and significant restrictions on
hiring and firing. However, in investor and business surveys, labor market constraints are
typically not perceived as the main obstacles to doing business.
8.
Inflation during 2005 fell sharply from the high levels of 2004. The high inflation
rate in 2004 appears to have reflected lagged pass-through pressures from the large nominal
depreciation of the pound and lax monetary policy during 2003. The subsequent stabilization

-8-

of the exchange rate and the tightening of monetary conditions led to a fairly sharp decline in
inflation in 2005.2
Box 1. Privatization in Egypt
Asset sales in 2005/06 have surpassed expectations and have attracted international investors. In the
first nine months of 2005/06, 49 state assets were sold for a total of US$2.5 billion, including seven joint
venture banks and 20 percent of the government’s stake in Egypt Telecom. As of April 2006, 97 entities
were listed for sale by the government comprising 42 companies (or stakes in companies) and 55 joint
ventures (www.investment.gov.eg).

The proceeds are being allocated to the original owners (line ministries, public holding companies, the
Treasury) and are being used mostly to restructure remaining state enterprises; in 2004/05, about 20 percent
of the proceeds went to the Treasury. About 5 percent of the proceeds help finance employee compensation
packages at entities being privatized. Employees not retained are compensated, retrained, or shifted to
“sister” entities under the same state holding company.
According to the Ministry of Investment, the performance of privatized companies has been good.
Specifically, about 70 percent of the privatized companies surveyed had increased sales and profits, 90
percent had raised salaries or increased staff, and nearly 80 percent had strengthened their balance sheets.

Shortcomings in the CPI data (such as a large share of subsidized products, and an underweighting of services)
complicate the assessment of inflation developments.

-9-

9.
The authorities implemented a range of structural reforms in the fiscal area
in 2005. On the revenue side, the government reduced and streamlined corporate and
individual income taxes, moved to self-assessment procedures, and established a large
taxpayer center (Box 2). On the expenditure side, the budget for 2005/06 made explicit for
the first time the large fuel subsidy provided by the state-owned oil company, Egyptian
General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC). While not involving cash payments through the
budget (the cash impact is reflected in foregone tax/dividend payments by EGPC), this has
contributed to a wider public debate on subsidies.
Box 2. Reforms in Tax Policy and Revenue Administration
As part of an ongoing overhaul of the tax regime supported by Fund technical assistance, the authorities:
•

Adopted a new customs tariff in 2004 that simplified the tariff structure and reduced the weighted
average tariff rate from 14 to 9 percent, and the unweighted average from 27 to 20 percent.

•

Passed a new income tax law in mid-2005 that reduced the top marginal tax rates on income and
profits from 32 to 20 percent for individuals and from 40 to 20 percent for corporations and
partnerships (EGPC, the Suez Canal authority, and the central bank were left at 40 percent). The
reform increased the exemption threshold, provided for more generous depreciation allowances,
broadened the tax base by eliminating deductions, and provided for the phasing out of tax holidays
while grandfathering current beneficiaries.

•

Began modernizing tax administration with (i) the successful introduction of self-assessment, (ii)
the creation of a Large Taxpayer Office in 2005, and (iii) preparation for integration of the Income
Tax and Sales Tax Departments with the appointment of a single tax commissioner.

10.
Another accomplishment was the preparation in 2006 of a set of consolidated fiscal
accounts under the GFSM 2001 budget classification. This has increased the transparency
and consistency of the fiscal accounts. The authorities are in the process of addressing a
number of remaining issues, notably, fully harmonizing the coverage of the fiscal accounts
“above” and “below the line” and reconciling financing flows with debt stocks (Table 3).
11.
Historical data revisions and the reclassification of accounts revealed a weaker
fiscal position in recent years than what had been depicted earlier (Table 4). In the
process of migrating to the new budget classification (NBC) in 2005, the authorities made
significant revisions to the historical series, and also reclassified some operations as abovethe-line items (an adjustment Fund staff made to get the augmented fiscal balance presented
in recent Article IV staff reports based on the old budget classification). These revisions,
starting in 2001/02, resulted in a large upward adjustment of the previous deficit estimates
for 2001/02-03/04. Adoption of the NBC and the move to a cash basis explain a smaller part
of the upward revision in the deficit estimates.
12.
Under the NBC-based fiscal accounts, the consolidated general government
deficit in 2005/06 is projected at 8.3 percent of GDP, down from 9.1 percent of GDP
in 2004/05. The improvement reflects exceptional receipts related to: (i) the partial sale of
Egypt Telecom (0.8 percent of GDP), and (ii) the payment of tax arrears by EGPC

- 10 -

(1.2 percent of GDP).3 The latter was financed by incurring an external liability of
US$1.55 billion secured by a forward sale of oil. Revenue losses from the income tax reform
(involving steep rate cuts) in 2005 are estimated at 1 percent of GDP. These losses are
expected to be short-lived because the tax reform should broaden the base, lead to greater
compliance (there is already some evidence of a surge in tax filings), and eventually generate
a higher yield. Domestic fuel subsidies are set to increase by 2.6 percent of GDP to
6.9 percent of GDP.
III. KEY ISSUES AND VIEWS OF THE AUTHORITIES
Overview and reform objectives
13.
In order to lower unemployment, the government agreed with staff that the
economy will need to grow on a sustained basis by at least 6–7 percent, and that total
investment will need to reach about 25 percent of GDP, well above recent levels of around
18 percent of GDP. In the authorities’ view, the main constraints to private investment and
higher growth are inefficiencies in financial intermediation and bureaucratic barriers to
business development. The high level of unproductive government spending (i.e., subsidies)
and distortions in relative prices, particularly energy prices, have also hindered growth.
Macro framework and balance of payments outlook
14.
The discussions were framed in a macroeconomic scenario based on moderate
fiscal adjustment (baseline scenario discussed below) and continued structural reforms.
Under this scenario, staff expects increased government savings and the supply impulse
driven by structural reforms to gradually raise productivity and boost private investment as a
share of GDP to 20 percent by 2011 (Table 5), along with a small increase in government
investment to 5 percent of GDP.4 Real GDP growth is projected to increase over time to
6.5 percent by 2010/11, and structural unemployment to be reduced by about 2 percentage
points over the period. The external current account would move from a surplus of 2 percent
of GDP in 2005/06 to a deficit of 2 percent of GDP by 2011, financed largely by non-debtcreating capital inflows. Egypt’s external debt is expected to decline gradually over the
medium term, even in the face of external shocks (Tables 8 and 9), and external
vulnerabilities will remain low.

4

These are recorded under the GFSM 2001 framework as receipts “above the line.”

The average investment ratio from 1980 to 2000 was 24 percent of GDP, but investment fell sharply from
2000-2004 during the economic slowdown. The projected increase in investment is driven by fiscal
consolidation (total savings as a share of GDP is assumed to rise by 2 percentage points), and by other growthenchancing structural reforms.

- 11 -

Fiscal Policy
15.
The authorities outlined a range of measures aimed at bringing the deficit down
by at least 1 percent of GDP annually for five years. The plan involves the following mix
of measures—to be phased in gradually starting in 2006/07:
i)

reforming domestic fuel subsidies by targeting them more effectively on the poor
and providing incentives to switch to natural gas;

ii)

streamlining and improving the product targeting of food subsidies;

iii)

instituting wage and employment measures designed to contain the wage bill,
including a partial hiring freeze and measures to slow wage drift; the authorities
plan to submit to parliament in 2006 a comprehensive reform of the civil service
expected to contribute to fiscal consolidation;

iv)

reforming the GST into a unified VAT with a broader base, a single rate, and a
higher threshold, with a presumptive tax regime for small businesses;

v)

broadening the base and streamlining rates for the property tax and stamp taxes;

vi)

introducing a Treasury Single Account (TSA) to help improve cash management
and increase control over off-budget resources kept by budget entities in the
banking system;

vii)

reorganizing the institutional layout and streamlining the flow of funds between
the budget, the National Investment Bank (NIB), and the Social Insurance Funds
(SIFs);

viii)

tightening controls on operating flows with state enterprises to increase the
transparency and control of expenditures;

ix)

improving debt management; and

x)

launching public private partnerships (PPPs) to finance the provision of muchneeded public investment, particularly for schools and health clinics.

16.
Possible sources of fiscal pressure in the coming years include pension reform
and bank restructuring. A public pension reform plan is currently being formulated with
assistance from the World Bank, and could have sizeable transition costs, depending on the
final design. The main features of the plan comprise closing the current system to new
entrants, establishing a fully funded contributory system for new entrants, and adding a

Box 3. Subsidies in Egypt
Public spending on subsidies has increased dramatically in recent years and now far exceeds outlays on
education and health. While subsidies have been motivated by social concerns, preliminary data indicate that the
share of the population living below the poverty line (headcount ratio) has nevertheless increased since 2000.

The benefits are not well targeted. Recent studies (World Bank, USAID, World Food Program) show that fuel
subsidies benefit mostly the production sector, as households account directly for less than 20 percent of energy
consumption. The richest quintile of households reaps 93 percent of the gasoline subsidy and 65 percent of the
natural gas subsidy, while many poor households do not have access to the required food ration cards. A recent
World Bank simulation estimated that the poverty headcount ratio would drop by 6.1 points to 13.5 percent if
subsidies were reduced by 50 percent and the savings allocated to households as cash transfers.
Subsidies have contributed to a misallocation of resources. Retail prices of petroleum products are among the
lowest in the world. By increasing the profitability of fuel-intensive sectors, investments are likely to be
channeled into activities with sub-optimal social returns. Per unit of output, Egypt’s energy use in 2000 was
close to that of the United States, and CO2 emissions were among the highest in the world (WDI 2000).

noncontributory minimum pension plan (integrating various existing schemes). As for bank
restructuring, the authorities intend to finance the rest of their restructuring program with
privatization proceeds. If privatization progresses at the current pace, proceeds should cover
bank recapitalization costs over time.
17.
In the absence of any reform measures, and assuming one-off receipts are not
repeated, the general government deficit would reach about 10 percent of GDP
in 2006/07 (“passive” scenario, below). While the central government budget for 2006/07
approved by parliament did not include any of the new measures specified above, the
authorities plan to start phasing them in this year, particularly the fuel subsidy reform, which
would translate into higher cash tax payments from EGPC (up to several percentage points of
GDP); the GST/VAT reform, which would, depending on the unified rate chosen, yield a half
year impact of at least 0.5 percent of GDP; and further measures, such as the TSA
(0.5 percent of GDP from savings on interest payments) and better expenditure control.
Based on these indications from the authorities—i.e., adjustment equivalent to about
2 percent of GDP— during 2006/07, staff estimate that the general government deficit could
be reduced to 8.1 percent of GDP.
18.
Outlook: Under the “baseline” scenario (deficit 8.1 percent of GDP in 2006/07 and a
1 percent of GDP annual adjustment thereafter), net public debt would decline after five
years to 65 percent of GDP—the June 2004 level. A gradual decline in the debt/GDP ratio
would still occur under various shocks (Table 7). A more ambitious adjustment path
(“ambitious” scenario) of an additional 0.5 percent adjustment of GDP annually would lower
debt to 58 percent of GDP by June 2011. If the underlying deficit were maintained at
10 percent of GDP (“passive” scenario), public debt would continue rising along recent
trends and reach 83 percent of GDP in 2011. It is important to note, however, that the
investor base, structure, and composition of Egypt’s domestic public debt stock help to limit
near-term vulnerabilities normally associated with debt levels of this magnitude (see Country
Report No. 05/177, Staff Report, Box 1).

Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
19.
The CBE is modernizing monetary policy formulation and operations, and
confirmed its plans to adopt a formal inflation targeting (IT) framework over the
medium-term. In this context, the CBE has established a corridor for the interbank
overnight rate and significantly enhanced communications with the publication of a monetary
policy statement and releases following regular Monetary Policy Committee meetings. The
central bank is also developing its macroeconomic analysis and forecasting capacity.
20.
In the transition to inflation targeting, the CBE has adopted a monetary policy
framework relying on broad indicative guidance from monetary aggregates and various
inflation measures in the context of a managed float. The authorities attributed the decline
in inflation through March 2006 to the secular decline of broad money (M2) growth since
early 2004 and the appreciation and subsequent stability of the LE/US$ exchange rate
during 2005. In their view, the surge in 2005 in the growth of domestic currency broad
money (M2D) above indicative “target” zones of around 12–13 percent was caused by
portfolio shifts related to increased confidence in the Egyptian pound, with no inflationary
consequences. The CBE considers the current stance of monetary policy to be broadly
consistent with stabilizing inflation at current low levels of 4–6 percent, assuming money
demand continues to grow somewhat faster than GDP. However, it stands ready to tighten

- 15 -

policies should signs of inflationary pressures re-emerge. The authorities expressed concern
about continued weak credit growth. This can be explained by the fact that central bank rate
cuts have not been fully passed through to bank lending rates, commercial banks remain
overly cautious following the bad loan build-up of earlier years, and commercial banks have
preferred alternative assets (government securities, foreign assets) with more favorable
risk/return characteristics.

The interbank foreign exchange market is operating smoothly and market
participants expressed satisfaction with its efficient functioning. In the context of the
recent large balance of payments surpluses, the CBE has used the abundance of foreign
exchange liquidity over the past year as an opportunity to strengthen its international reserve
position, both through purchases
outside the market on behalf of the

government (e.g., converting Suez

22.
While reaffirming their commitment
to a managed float, the authorities
expressed concern about the effect of a
nominal appreciation, driven in part by
temporary capital inflows, on
competitiveness. They pointed in particular to
stagnation in the growth of non-oil exports
during the second half of 2005 and to the
importance of supporting the tourism sector.
Going forward, the CBE believes that the
trade deficit is likely to widen as growth rises,
while portfolio inflows should weaken as
interest rate differentials narrow; both
developments should put downward pressure
on the currency.

The slow-down in growth and the decline in reserves suggest that the Egyptian pound
was substantially overvalued in 2000. The large depreciation that occurred between 2001
and 2004 appears to have broadly restored equilibrium. However, major structural breaks and

Financial sector restructuring
24.
The authorities have achieved significant progress in strengthening the banking
sector. The government sold its stake in most joint venture banks, thereby transferring
nearly 20 percent of the banking system (measured by deposits) from de facto public control
to the private sector. The sale of Bank of Alexandria (BoA) is on track to be completed in
late 2006. The authorities are merging two of the remaining three state banks, and intend to
restructure and recapitalize the resulting two state banks over the next three years. While the
current reform would still leave more than 40 percent of the banking system (based on
current shares in deposits) under state ownership by 2008, the authorities expect this share to
decline rapidly, given the much faster growth in private sector banks.
25.
The soundness of the financial
sector has been improving. Capital
adequacy ratios have been rising
since 2001, the rates of return on assets and
on capital have trended upwards, and
nonperforming loans (NPLs) recently
started to decline as a share of total loans
(Table 11). Workout units in the state
banks, supported by CBE-led arbitration,
have restructured about one half of
outstanding private sector NPLs. All public
sector NPLs of BoA were settled in cash in
early 2006, and the planned clearance of
public sector NPLs of other state banks
should further improve the NPL/loan and

provisioning/NPL ratios. Exposure of the banking system to exchange rate risk remains low,
although sustained large exposure to the public sector will be incompatible with a vibrant
growth-enhancing financial system (Box 4).
Box 4. Balance Sheet Analysis of the Banking Sector
From 2002 to 2005, the banking sector (excluding the CBE) has more than doubled its net exposure in
local currency to the government sector (including the CBE), from 10 to 25 percent of GDP, while
sharply reducing net claims on the business sector. Net exposure to the government surpassed that to
businesses at end-2005.
The increase in claims on the
government arises from past large
fiscal deficits and an increase in
deposits with the CBE, which reflects
the recent strong NFA growth.
Declining exposure to the private
sector is due in part to the recent loan
portfolio clean-up and to the portfolio
choices of banks in favor of
government securities and central
bank deposits over corporate loans.
This is likely to have reduced credit
and interest maturity risks in the
banking sector.

However, stagnating credit to business

may amplify macro volatility because

it reduces the financial sector’s ability
CB
to efficiently reallocate financial
resources across firms. This would be
more critical during bad times when profitable firms experiencing temporary cash shortages might face
financing constraints. More generally, sustained large government borrowing can harm the depth and
quality of financial development, as banks have lesser incentives to improve efficiency.
Net foreign currency-denominated claims on the government and business sectors have declined
since 2002, while claims on the rest of the world (mainly deposits with correspondents) increased from
about US$4 billion at end-2002 to US$13 billion in early 2006. Banks’ net open positions are not large,
and the aggregate net open position is negligible, implying a low overall foreign exchange risk. The
decline in foreign currency exposure to entities with revenues mostly in local currency (government and
local businesses) has further reduced exchange rate risk.

26.
Egypt’s stock market was one of the top performers in 2005. The bull market,
which started in late 2003, was driven by increased confidence in economic policies, but was
also fueled by ample domestic and regional liquidity related to the oil boom. The market
experienced a sharp correction in early 2006, falling by 33 percent between the January peak
and late May. However, this was less than most Gulf markets, mainly because the rise in
valuations in Egypt in 2005 was much less than experienced in the Gulf (or during the 2000
dotcom bubble in the United States). The price/earnings ratio hit 27 in January, before falling

- 18 -

to 15 in May. The correction has so far had little visible impact on the economy, in part
because market capitalization is still relatively low, and trading is concentrated in a few big
stocks. The value of the biggest five (ten) companies account for 62 percent (80) percent of
the market. While information on the makeup of the investor base is limited, the correction
was reportedly driven more by retail investors who entered the market in 2005. Anecdotal
evidence suggests that potential risks to the banking system as a result of margin lending to
retail investors is likely to be limited, consistent with the observed weak credit growth.

Outside the banking sector, state-owned insurance companies are also being
restructured, with a view to privatization. Capital market regulation is well advanced in
adopting best practices, and the stock market is enforcing higher standards of corporate
governance. The authorities are also in the process of bringing supervision in banking and
insurance into compliance with international best practices. However, the tax-free treatment
of interest on government securities appears to be undermining the development of broader
capital markets, and the secondary market in government securities remains small. The
authorities are interested in an FSAP update in 2007 to assess progress in the financial
restructuring program and take stock of the changes wrought by the recent reforms.
Other structural reforms and data issues
28.
The authorities are contemplating further tariff reductions to build on the gains
achieved in September 2004, when the government restructured and lowered tariff rates by
7 percentage points to 20 percent (unweighted average). These are still considerably higher
than the current average of 11.2 percent for countries in the Middle-East and Central Asia.
Egypt’s weighted average tariff rate is 9 percent.
29.
The government recently submitted draft legislation to parliament to establish
specialized economic courts. These are designed to reduce red tape and to improve the
judicial framework underlying business contracts. This approach is based on previous
positive experiences reforming institutions by developing improved processes on a parallel
track. In addition, disputes between private sector operators and the government are
increasingly being resolved by a ministerial committee.

- 19 -

30.
The authorities are giving data quality problems greater attention. A high level
inter-ministerial committee has been established to address weaknesses in statistics, notably
the CPI and FDI data, where shortcomings include the quality of coverage and sampling and
limited cooperation between the relevant agencies.
31.
A high-level ministerial committee has been established to coordinate Egypt’s
response to the avian flu threat. Avian flu has so far affected only the poultry sector and
the authorities have not prepared a specific program for the financial sector. They do not
expect the avian flu to pose a problem for the functioning of the financial system. However,
they expressed interest in understanding the best-practice measures being developed
elsewhere and plan to participate in international seminars for bank supervisors on the topic.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
32.
The staff essentially concurs with the authorities’ economic objectives and policy
priorities. Under the authorities’ strategy, fixed investment will need to rise considerably,
and private sector growth will need to drive employment creation. Staff welcomes the
authorities’ decision to place fiscal consolidation at the center of Egypt’s macroeconomic
policy agenda, which will imply difficult policy choices and require strong efforts at
consensus building. However, favorable global economic conditions make the timing ripe for
tackling tough issues, which will have long-term positive effects on the economy. Staff
appreciates the authorities’ active participation in elaborating a technical assistance strategy
that ties TA priorities closely to the government’s reform agenda, and will help guide the
Fund’s technical assistance to Egypt over the coming years.
33.
Fiscal consolidation is central to achieving the authorities’ growth objectives. In
this regard, absent the “one-time receipts” of 2 percent of GDP, the general government
fiscal deficit in 2005/06 would rise. Public debt needs to be put on a firmly declining path to
ensure macroeconomic stability over the long run, reduce uncertainty for investors, and avoid
debt overhang effects. In addition, growing public debt, which already limits the authorities’
budget flexibility, will further squeeze their ability to use countercyclical fiscal policy to
cope with exogenous shocks. Finally, a large share of government spending is unproductive
and has encouraged a misallocation of resources, with fuel subsidies being the most obvious
example.
34.
The government’s multi-year fiscal consolidation plan is welcome. However, a
more ambitious medium-term fiscal adjustment, on the order of 1.5 percent of GDP annually
over five years, would more decisively reverse the debt dynamics in the coming years. Even
then, debt levels would remain high for many years, particularly relative to other highgrowth emerging markets. The fiscal consolidation program should be based on a
comprehensive and appropriately prioritized strategy, and should be centered on subsidy
reduction and early introduction of a modern VAT. Medium-term expenditure rationalization
should be guided by the relative efficiency of major spending categories in terms of
performance outcomes, rather than relying on ad hoc or across-the-board cuts. Social
assistance should be targeted more directly at low-income households.

- 20 -

35.
For 2006/07, the budget approved by parliament needs to be complemented by
specific fiscal measures. The measures outlined by the authorities look promising, and if
fully implemented, could produce the desired adjustment. Since several of the measures
require legislative action, staff urges prompt action to introduce the relevant laws to
parliament and press for early adoption in order to contain the general government deficit
for 2006/07 to 8 percent of GDP.
36.
The authorities plan to rely partly on public private partnerships (PPPs) for
financing much needed public investment, particularly in the social sectors. Staff believe
that public investment should primarily be financed with resources freed up by cuts in
inefficient current spending (e.g., subsidies). Use of PPPs would require that close attention
be paid to the supporting legal and institutional framework underpinning contracts. Any
contingencies arising from PPPs should be recorded explicitly in the budget in the interests
of fiscal prudence and transparency. Similarly, staff encourages the authorities to carefully
assess and contain any transitional fiscal costs from the planned pension reform.
37.
The current stance of monetary policy appears appropriate for sustaining
current low levels of inflation. Thus, additional interest rate reductions should wait until
liquidity growth decelerates further and low inflation becomes firmly entrenched. The
authorities need to monitor closely the rate of growth in broad money, and specifically
domestic currency broad money. The large government deficit, financed in recent months
mostly from nonbank sources, may eventually need more financing from the domestic
banking system, which could put further pressure on monetary aggregates or crowd out
private credit. Staff supports the CBE’s goal of moving to formal inflation targeting (IT), and
recommends accelerating the reforms needed to support central bank operational autonomy
and strengthen policy formulation. These include: revisiting the composition of the Monetary
Policy Committee to ensure greater independence, preparing legislation prohibiting monetary
financing of fiscal deficits, building up CBE forecasting and analytical capabilities, and
further enhancing communication on monetary policy with the public.
38.
Staff estimate that the real appreciation since 2004 reflects the appreciation of
Egypt’s equilibrium real exchange rate stemming from (i) a large improvement in the
country’s net external position and (ii) a surge in both the volume and the U.S. dollar value
of proven hydrocarbon reserves. However, looking forward, it is doubtful that the non-oil
export and tourism sectors could sustain a further real appreciation of the pound without
losing market share. In the context of the ongoing gradual weakening of external balances,
there may thus be a good case for the central bank to occasionally lean against nominal
appreciation driven by transitional capital inflows (e.g. privatization receipts) until ongoing
structural reforms translate into tangible productivity gains.
39.
The CBE could, at the same time, allow market forces greater play in exchange
rate developments. This would help discourage one way bets and encourage the
development of risk management instruments, and more generally help in deepening the
foreign exchange market. Furthermore, greater flexibility would be required if the CBE

- 21 -

moved to a formal IT framework, and allowing some fluctuations in the rate would be helpful
in getting the public accustomed to movements in the exchange rate.
40.
The successful restructuring of the BoA highlights the useful influence that the
goal of privatization can have on the process of bank modernization and reform.
Completion of the audits of the remaining state banks, and their independent analysis, is
essential for further progress in banking restructuring. Even at the end of the current financial
reform program (2008), however, a large share of the banking system would remain under
state ownership, raising concerns about the efficiency of financial intermediation and about a
level playing field between public and private banks.
41.
The results of the privatization program and near-term plans demonstrate the
government’s commitment to reducing the role of the state in the productive sectors of
the economy. Staff welcomes efforts to secure sustained support for the privatization
program through the wide dissemination of relevant information on the distribution and use
of the proceeds.
42.
Further efforts are needed to improve the legal and institutional framework for
the production of economic statistics and to increase inter-agency cooperation. This is
necessary to support the work needed to improve statistics on prices, balance of payments,
real indicators of economic activity, and the fiscal accounts.
43.
The mission welcomes the government’s intentions to consider further tariff
reductions. The system of exemptions and duty relief schemes not addressed by the 2004
reform should be phased out.
44.
The ongoing review of Egypt’s exchange system, in connection with Egypt’s
acceptance of the obligations under Article VIII, is expected to be concluded by the time of
the 2006 Article IV consultation Executive Board meeting.
45.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with the Arab Republic of Egypt
take place on the 12 month cycle.

1/ Fiscal year ends June 30.
2/ Authorities’ estimates based on revised source data and new budget classification. New series are not comparable to those in last staff
report (Country Report No. 05/177).
3/ There is a series break in 2005/06, when notional recording of fuel subsidies was made explicit in budget expenditures. The counterpart
is a larger notional payment by the oil company (EGPC) by an equivalent amount (see footnote 3 of Table 3).
4/ As calculated by the MOF, but adjusted by: (i) including the repayment of past arrears as a capital spending
item (purchase of nonfinancial assets), and (ii) eliminating the creation of arrears from the financing side, as well as from capital spending.
5/ For 2005/06, averages refer to July 05-May 06 period; for stock market, index as of April 2006.
6/ For 2005/06, unemployment rate as of December 2005.

1/ Refers to the general government, including government guaranteed debt.
2/ Derived as [(r - p(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; p = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;
a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as ae(1+r).
5/ The projections are purely illustrative as the level of future privatization receipts accrueing to the budget is highly uncertain and bank recapitalization requirements
are yet to be finalized, but reflect the authorities’ intention to finance recapitalization outlays with privatization receipts.
6/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
7/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
8/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
9/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period gross debt stock.
10/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

1/ Includes multilateral and bilateral public sector borrowing and private borrowing.
2/ Data before 2004/05 are the CBE data on non-oil FDI augmented by estimates of FDI in the oil and gas sector derived from EGPC annual reports.
3/ In addition to the revisions to the FDI data (see footnote 2), IMF staff make three other adjustments to the official balance of payments data.
First, the CBE estimates record the difference between a headcount-based estimate of tourism-related inflows and the estimates obtained from
the International Transactions Recording System as an outflow in the capital account. The Staff estimates here record only the flows based on direct
estimates of tourist arrivals with the errors and omissions line offsetting any upward bias implicit in these estimates.
Second, because of large discrepancies between the annual flows of net short-term suppliers credits and changes in end-of-period stocks in the official
data, net flows of short-term suppliers credits are not identified here and are instead absorbed in errors and omissions. Third, unlike in the official data,
and in order to preserve symmetry with unrecorded capital outflows on account of currency substitution in earlier years, reverse currency substitution
in 2004/05 is not recorded under other capital inflows, but instead reflected in errors and omissions.
4/ The official data on external debt do not include non-resident holdings of domestic currency-denominated Treasury Bills
(about US$1.6 billion at end-2005). BIS data for non-bank private sector external debt suggest that the official data on external debt underestimate
the former by US$1.3 billion and the latter by more than US$3 billion.

Debt stabilizing
curr. acc. 6/

Sources: IMF staff estimates and projections.
1/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; ρ = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms, g = real GDP growth rate,
ε = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and α = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock. ρ increases with an appreciating domestic currency (ε > 0) and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels
of the last projection year.

Real GDP growth (in percent)
GDP deflator in US dollars (change in percent)
Nominal external interest rate (in percent)

APPENDIX I

Exchange Rate Arrangement (As of March 31, 2006):

Prior to January 29, 2003, the Egyptian pound was pegged to the dollar, with all foreign
exchange transactions taking place within a ±3 percent range around the central rate, which
was announced by the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE). Effective January 29, 2003, the
Egyptian pound was allowed to float. As a result, the exchange arrangement of Egypt was
reclassified to the category “managed float with no preannounced path for the exchange
rate,” from the category “pegged exchange rate within horizontal bands.” In December 2004,
the CBE officially launched the foreign exchange interbank market with no controls on rates,
governed by a formal interbank convention on foreign exchange trading. Since early 2005,
the LE/US$ rate has fluctuated in a narrow range, akin to a de facto peg. Egypt maintains an
inoperative bilateral payments arrangement with Sudan. A joint LEG/MFD team is reviewing
the foreign exchange system in connection with Egypt’s acceptance of the obligations of
Article VIII in 2005.

Article IV Consultation:

Consultations with Egypt are on a 12-month cycle. The last Article IV consultation
discussions were held in Cairo from February 2-16, 2005. The staff report (Country Report
No. 05/177) was discussed by the Executive Board on May 18, 2005. The 2005 Article IV

APPENDIX II

Egypt: Relations with the World Bank
1.
Partnership for Development. Key development objectives of the government of
Egypt as expressed in its development plan are to achieve high and sustainable growth by
enhancing the role of the private sector in the development process; focusing the public
sector on delivering public goods; and strengthening the social safety net system. Within the
context of a lending program (outlined in the Country Assistance Strategy of FY2002-2004)
which was modest in relation to the size and importance of the country, the Bank assisted the
government in addressing its development challenges. During that CAS period, the Bank and
the government also collaborated on several pieces of analytical work that led to both a better
and a shared understanding in such areas as poverty trends, gender achievements and
education sector needs. The spirit that marked this collaborative effort bodes well for the
future as the shared understanding feeds into policy and project design as well as leads to
faster implementation of Bank interventions.
2.
World Bank Country Assistance Strategy. The current Bank assistance to Egypt is
anchored in a Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for the period FY2006–09, which the
Board of Directors endorsed on June 16, 2005. In line with the government’s development
and reform agenda, the current CAS identified and implements interventions that will
(i) facilitate private sector development; (ii) enhance the provision of public services; and
(iii) promote equity.
3.
IMF-World Bank Collaboration in Specific Areas. The Bank and IMF will
continue to collaborate efforts in supporting the government in the areas of: macroeconomic
framework and management; budget and public expenditure management; public sector
reform; and private and financial sector development.
IBRD/IDA Portfolio
4.
As of February 28, 2006, the Bank had approved 112 projects for Egypt, valued at
about $5.34 billion (excluding grants and cancellations), of which about $4.7 billion have
been disbursed, and about US$879.9 million remain undisbursed. The current portfolio has
15 active projects with commitment value of about US$1.3 billion. The sectoral composition
of the current portfolio (by value) is as follows: 25 percent for infrastructure, 29 percent for
agriculture, 15 percent for education, 7 percent for health, 4 percent for social protection,
and 20 percent for power.
International Finance Corporation (IFC) Investments
5.
Currently (as at February 28, 2006), Egypt is one of IFC’s two largest exposure
countries in the MNA Region with a portfolio of $287 million invested in 22 companies in
the financial sector, power, export-oriented manufacturing, ports, oil and gas, metals,
agribusiness and IT. IFC’s PEP-MENA TA work in Egypt has also been strongly supported
by the government including business start-up simplification, SME access to finance and

APPENDIX III

Egypt: Statistical Issues
Economic and financial statistics provided to the fund are broadly adequate for surveillance
purposes. A data ROSC was conducted in October 2003, and published in July 2005,
assessing the quality of Egypt’s macroeconomic statistics and recommending improvements.
Egypt subscribed to the SDDS in January 2005. Remaining SDDS issues include the
timeliness of the labor market data on employment and unemployment, and the timeliness
and periodicity of the labor market data for wages/earnings and data for central government
operations.
National accounts. National accounts data are compiled on an annual fiscal year basis and a
quarterly basis by the National Accounts Department within the Ministry of Planning in
current and constant prices, using the 1993 System of National Accounts (SNA 1993). The
data have a number of shortcomings, including inconsistencies with balance of payments
statistics and the absence of a reliable series on GDP and its uses at constant prices (the base
year is often changed without an overlap for the series with different base). The problem is
exacerbated by the absence of a reliable system of current indicators of economic activity.
The authorities requested Fund’s technical assistance in this area. Accordingly, an STA
consultant joined the 2001 Article IV mission and provided concrete recommendations in the
compilation and dissemination of high frequency real sector data. Since January 2002, the
authorities have initiated the collection of a monthly index of industrial production, which
was first published in April 2003. The October 2003 data ROSC mission found that work
still needs to be done to improve national accounts statistics, including the need for a more
critical review of source statistics. There are no periodic user surveys or an oversight body to
provide guidance on the quality of national accounts.
•
Price statistics. An updated CPI with new weights based on a 1999–2000 household
expenditure survey was first published in April 2004. The October 2003 ROSC found that
various constraints, including inadequate computer resources, have curtailed much needed
innovations in the CPI, and the index may not be accurate. There are concerns regarding the
quality of price statistics, and lack of systematic reviews to identify shortcomings; price
statistics are revised without providing explanation, most recently in August 2005. The
authorities have upgraded computer equipment and are developing a comprehensive price
database, in cooperation with donors. In this regard, there are plans to further improve the
CPI and to replace the wholesale price index with a producer price index and to improve the
external trade price indices (the latter are unreliable and available only annually). The
authorities are currently involved in projects to improve the CPI and to complete
development of the PPI with technical assistance from METAC in close cooperation with the
STA. These actions are complemented by a training program in price statistics to be
delivered by the U.S. BLS.
•
Balance of Payments (BOP) statistics. The BOP statistics, compiled by the Central
Bank of Egypt (CBE) and reported to the Fund, have been revised with Fund technical
assistance in accordance with the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual (BMP5).

- 40 -

APPENDIX III

Although the national presentation is less detailed than in BPM5, data are provided to
international organizations using BPM5 format. The October 2003 ROSC noted that Egypt’s
balance of payments statistics face problems with source data. Because merchandise trade
statistics based on customs declarations have serious problems, BOP compilers rely on
banks’ foreign exchange records for exports and imports of goods; however, the coverage
and classification of foreign exchange transactions are deteriorating following exchange
liberalization, and source data do not reasonably approximate the accrual basis. Another key
shortcoming is the lack of coverage of direct investment enterprises. The CBE is working
with other agencies to improve both customs and direct investment statistics. A
December 2004 STA mission noted that the CBE has started to disseminate quarterly BOP
data and provide detailed sources and methods on the CBE website on the basis of BPM5,
and a committee has been established to coordinate work on direct investment data.
•
METAC external sector statistics related missions in 2005. A METAC mission in
March 2005 provided technical assistance in measuring foreign direct investment (FDI) to
the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE), the Ministry of Investment (MOI), and the General
Administration for Investment and Free Zones (GAFI). The METAC expert made several
recommendations, including proposing a benchmark FDI survey of 500 to 600 FDI
enterprises to collect data on the stocks and flows associated with FDI. The mission
concluded that the GAFI, with its resources and capability of its staff, can conduct the
survey. Further, based on discussions with the CBE, MOI, GAFI, the Ministry of Petroleum,
the Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics, the Capital Market Authority, and
the American Chamber of Commerce, recommendations were made to the CBE to revise the
balance of payments data related to direct investment, services receipts, income payments,
other foreign investments in Egypt, and other sectors’ assets abroad. These recommendations
were consistent with the data ROSC mission’s recommendations. Subsequently, the CBE
incorporated petroleum investment data into the balance of payments for the third and fourth
quarters of 2004 and first quarter of 2005.
•
External debt and the international investment position (IIP). A STA mission in
December 2004 found that the authorities had made progress in the compilation of the IIP,
and determined that the IIP compiled for end-2003 met the SDDS prescriptions. Similarly,
data on external debt now meets SDDS requirements. The authorities are drawing on advice
from Fund staff and other outside advisers to design a strategy for strengthening the reporting
system on nonguaranteed debt.
•
Fiscal data. Egypt does not report fiscal data for publication in the International
Financial Statistics (IFS); annual data were last reported for 2003 for the Government
Finance Statistics (GFS) Yearbook. Some of the requirements of the Government Finance
Statistics Manual 2001 have been met. The authorities have adopted a new budget
classification (NBC) based on the GFSM 2001, with FAD and STA advice. The
consolidation of general government operations (budget sector, National Investment Bank,
and Social Insurance Funds) under this new classification has yet to be finalized, and has
been applied only to “above-the-line” transactions. In addition, there have been large

revisions to fiscal data for 2001/02-2004/05, and the authorities do not plan to report fiscal
data under the NBC prior to 2001/02. Other areas that have been the subject of recent STA
TA have been the reconciliation of fiscal and monetary accounts and improving the
definition and measurement of public debt.
•
Monetary statistics. The statistics are comprehensive and reported regularly.
However, the 2003 data ROSC mission raised the issue of potential overstatement of foreign
assets and liabilities of the banking sector, as recorded in the monetary statistics, because an
offshore bank located in Egypt is erroneously treated as a nonresident entity. The authorities
have begun providing monetary date to STA using the new Standardized Report Forms.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2006 Article IV Consultation
with the Arab Republic of Egypt
On June 23, 2006, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with the Arab Republic of Egypt.1
Background
Over the last two years, Egypt has accelerated reforms aimed at tackling impediments to
higher growth and employment creation. Implementation of a broad range of reforms aimed at
modernizing government and boosting private sector activity, and a favorable external
environment, have contributed to macroeconomic stability.
Growth accelerated to 5.7 percent in the first half of 2005/06. While the external sector
remains an important engine of growth, the expansion has become more broad-based, with
construction and services now increasing at a healthy rate. Employment is rising, but
continued high unemployment points to the need to further boost private investment and
growth.
Inflation fell sharply during 2005, and real interest rates turned positive for the first time in
years. Headline CPI inflation declined from 17 percent (y/y) to 4 percent (y/y) over the 15
months through end-April 2006. The Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) introduced a corridor for
the overnight interbank rate in May 2005 that has reduced the volatility of short-term rates.
With inflation declining, the CBE started easing monetary policy in mid-2005. Money

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

-2aggregates expanded rapidly in 2005, but have decelerated in 2006. Lower policy rates have
not been fully passed through to bank lending rates, and growth of credit to the private sector
remains weak.
The interbank foreign exchange market launched in late-2004 is functioning well, with banks
free to buy and sell foreign exchange at market determined rates. In a context of ample dollar
liquidity from large balance of payments surpluses, the CBE has been buying large amounts
of foreign exchange, in part to strengthen international reserves. As a result, the Egyptian
pound-U.S. dollar exchange rate has been virtually unchanged since early 2005, while the
growth in the net foreign assets of the banking system was the main source of money
creation in 2005.
The balance of payments and external positions remain comfortable. International reserves
have increased from US$15 billion to US$22.5 billion (7½ months of imports) over the 15
months through end-March 2006. With non-oil imports growing rapidly, and non-oil exports
stagnating, the current account surplus has started to narrow. However, the country’s net
foreign asset position, both at the central bank and in the banking system, is being bolstered
by capital inflows, mostly nondebt creating. The external debt-to-GDP ratio, currently at
30 percent of GDP, is projected to decline in the coming years, reflecting prudent external
borrowing.
The authorities implemented a range of reforms in the fiscal area in 2005. On the revenue
side, the government reduced and streamlined corporate and individual income taxes, moved
to self-assessment procedures, and established a large taxpayer center. While expected to
lose revenue in the short run, the reforms have reportedly triggered greater tax compliance
and filing. On the expenditure side, a new budget classification in line with the IMF’s
Government Finance Statistics Manual (GFSM-2001) has been adopted. This has improved
fiscal transparency considerably. For instance, the budget for 2005/06 made explicit for the
first time the large fuel subsidy provided through the state owned Egyptian General Petroleum
Corporation (EGPC).
The consolidated general government deficit is projected at 8.3 percent of GDP in 2005/06,
down from 9.1 percent of GDP in 2004/05. The fiscal position in 2005/06 has benefited from
exceptional revenues arising from a payment of tax arrears by EGPC and the sale
of 20 percent of Egypt Telecom. Net public debt is projected to rise by about 1.6 percentage
points in 2005/06 to 69.8 percent of GDP by June 2006. The authorities are in the process of
preparing a package of measures aimed at reducing the deficit in the following years by at
least 1 percent of GDP per year, including streamlining of subsidies, introduction of a full
fledged VAT, and reduction in the growth of the wage bill.
Significant progress in the structural reform program of the government has taken Egypt
further along the road to a market economy. The privatization program is gaining momentum.
Regulatory and supervisory standards in the capital markets, insurance industry, and the
banking sector are being strengthened. The restructuring of state-owned banks is
progressing, including the sale of joint venture banks, and restructuring and settlement of
nonperforming loans. The privatization of the fourth-largest state bank (Bank of Alexandria) is
expected to be completed in 2006. Egypt’s stock market was the strongest performer in the
region in 2005.

-3Executive Board Assessment
Directors noted in particular the impressive decline in inflation, while the economic
recovery further accelerated and had become more broad based. This was supported by
strong achievements in privatization and financial sector reform, which had greatly
increased market confidence. They also commended the authorities’ strong efforts to put
in place structural reforms in the fiscal area that have improved the transparency and
efficiency of budget preparation and control. Looking ahead, Directors noted that
important challenges remain to enable Egypt to raise economic growth on a sustained
basis and lower unemployment, pointing in particular to the high government borrowing
and debt levels, and the shallow financial intermediation and bureaucratic barriers to
private sector activity.
Directors expressed concern about the large fiscal deficit and therefore welcomed the
authorities’ medium-term plan to reduce it by at least 1 percent of GDP per year. However,
they encouraged them to consider a more ambitious pace of adjustment to reverse more
decisively the debt dynamics, secure macroeconomic stability over time, and increase
investor confidence and the economy’s resilience to exogenous shocks. Directors urged the
authorities to swiftly implement measures to ensure the envisaged fiscal adjustment, noting in
particular the urgent need to reduce fuel subsidies and target them better.
Directors commended the efforts of the Central Bank of Egypt to modernize monetary policy
formulation and operations and agreed that the current stance of monetary policy appears to
be broadly consistent with stabilizing inflation at current levels. They nonetheless cautioned
that any additional interest rate reductions should wait until liquidity growth decelerates further
and low inflation becomes firmly entrenched, and noted that financing of the government
should be strictly limited.
Directors recommended accelerating the reforms needed to support central bank operational
autonomy and strengthen policy formulation, with a view to moving to a formal inflation
targeting framework over the medium term. However, they cautioned that this would also
require greater exchange rate flexibility.
Directors noted the smooth operation of the interbank foreign exchange market. However,
they favored allowing market forces to play a greater role in determining the exchange rate,
which will also foster the development of risk management instruments. They considered that
stepping up the pace of structural reforms would be well suited to counter the effect of
exchange rate appreciation by enhancing productivity and the competitiveness of the
economy.
Directors welcomed the achievements in the area of financial sector reform, including the sale
of many joint venture banks and the pending sale of Bank of Alexandria. They encouraged
the authorities to develop a clear medium-term plan for the privatization of the remaining
major state banks. Directors also welcomed the resolution of a large amount of private sector
nonperforming loans and noted the improvements in capital market regulation and efforts to
bring supervision in banking and insurance into compliance with international best practices.
Directors agreed with the authorities that a Financial Sector Assessment Program update
in 2007 would be a useful tool to assess progress in the financial restructuring program and
identify possible areas of weakness.

-4Directors were encouraged by the government’s intention to reduce barriers to private sector
activity through a further liberalization of the trade regime, a reduction of red tape, and the
improvement of the legal framework for business activities. They also pointed to the need to
further enhance the flexibility of the labor market and improve education and training to help
reduce skill mismatches.
Directors welcomed the establishment of the inter-ministerial committee to address
weaknesses in statistics, notably the CPI and FDI data. They urged the authorities to attach
high priority to strengthening the legal and institutional framework for the production of
economic statistics and to increase inter-agency cooperation.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
July 5, 2006

1.
The following information has become available since the issuance of the staff report
on June 15, 2006. It does not change the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
Inflation (as measured by the CPI) accelerated in May to 5.4 percent (y/y), from
4.4 percent in April, mainly due to higher food and telecommunication prices. M2 growth in
the year through April 2006 remained virtually unchanged from previous months at
12.8 percent. Available balance of payments data through March 2006 confirm the
weakening of the current account compared to last year. The accumulation of net
international reserves slowed to US$66 million in May, from a monthly average of
US$226 million during January-April.
3.
The stock market correction deepened somewhat; as of June 29, the broad CASE 30
index was down 25 percent for the year and 41 percent from the peak in early 2006. The
EMBI spread for Egypt widened to 94 basis points (June 28), from 58 basis points at end2005. Staff’s views on the likely economic impact of these developments have not changed.
4.
Parliament passed a general accounting law establishing the legal basis for the
introduction of a treasury single account (TSA). The TSA will be operational for flow
transactions by October 2006; existing government deposits will be integrated over 2-3 years.
5.
In June 2006, the World Bank Board approved a Financial Sector Development Loan
of US$0.5 billion in support of Egypt’s financial sector reform.
6.
Since March 31, 2006, another 10 state assets were sold under Egypt's privatization
program, of which half were land sales and the other half stakes in firms. This brings the
number of asset sales in 2005/06 to 59, for a total of US$ 2.6 billion.
7.
Staff has concluded the review of Egypt's exchange system in connection with
Egypt's acceptance (January 2, 2005) of the obligations under Article VIII, sections 2, 3 and
4 of the Articles of Agreement. On the basis of the information provided by the government
and in discussions with market participants, staff concludes that Egypt maintains an
exchange system that is free of exchange restrictions and multiple currency practices on the
making of payments and transfers for current international transactions. Staff also welcomes
the issuance of Decree No. 40 of 2006 issued by the CBE on June 8, 2006 which provides
for intra day adjustments of the CBE's exchange rates used for official transactions outside
the interbank foreign exchange market.

Statement by Shakour Shaalan, Executive Director for the Arab Republic of Egypt
July 5, 2006
1.
In many respects, economic developments in Egypt since last year’s consultation attest
to the authorities’ vigorous implementation of a bold and far-reaching reform agenda
introduced since mid-2004. The range of measures instituted so far, in particular the fiscal and
financial sector reforms, are successfully tackling deep-seated structural impediments and
injecting dynamism into the economy. In addition to important tax policy and administrative
reforms, tariff rates were substantially reduced, privatization of state assets was accelerated,
and measurable progress was accomplished in the divestiture of state ownership in the banking
sector. Improvements in the monetary policy framework continue to be implemented, building
up toward a formal inflation targeting regime in the medium-term, and coordination between
fiscal and monetary policies is being strengthened, contributing to improved economic
management. The impulse from these reforms was reflected in a solid economic growth in
2004/05, amidst an environment of modest inflation and stable market-determined exchange
rate. The expansion was supported by a strong external sector, and with the reforms currently
underway, is expected to accelerate further in 2005/06 and become even broader-based.
Market sentiment remains strong, reflected in the upward revision of the long-term outlook
from negative to stable last year by credit rating agencies, the continued tight spreads on
sovereign debt, and the surge in equity and foreign direct investment flows.
2.
The authorities are well aware of the ground they still need to cover to generate growth
rates of 6-7 percent and the required increase in investment levels to attain this goal. They also
recognize, however, that the next generation of structural reforms are inherently more difficult
to implement, and will therefore need to be mindful of political economy considerations and
calibrated so as to ensure broad public consensus for their implementation. In the period ahead,
the reform effort will focus on fiscal consolidation to reduce the high levels of deficit and
remove economic distortions induced by subsidies, persevering with financial sector reforms
to enhance financial intermediation in support of higher investment, and strengthening of the
business climate to promote corporate activity. Indeed, 2006/07 could well mark a turning
point for the Egyptian economy, with the benefits of the recently implemented fiscal and
structural reforms fully coming to fruition and laying the foundation for a stronger expansion
going forward.
Fiscal Policy and Reforms
3.
Fiscal consolidation remains a major pillar of the reform program. Measures to this end
have also focused on improving the structure and transparency of the budget, as well as
strengthening public expenditure management. An important accomplishment in this regard,
with Fund technical assistance, is the preparation of a set of consolidated fiscal accounts for
the 2005/06 budget using the GFSM 2001 classification. Under the new standard, many budget
lines were reclassified, including operations that were previously treated ‘below the line’, and
for the first time, the indirect petroleum subsidies provided by the state-owned oil company
were rendered explicit. Although the reclassification process revealed a weaker fiscal position,

2

the increased transparency and consistency that it brings to the budget will allow stronger
control over resources and expenditures. At 9.1 percent of GDP in 2004/05, the fiscal deficit is
admittedly large and unsustainable. While projected to decline to 8.3 percent in 2005/06, the
improvement in the fiscal position largely reflects the exceptional revenues from the partial
privatization of Egypt Telecom, and the settlement of tax arrears by the national oil company,
which have more than offset the initial losses from the income tax reforms.
4.
The authorities are fully committed to lowering the budget deficit by at least one
percentage point annually over the coming five years, effectively halving the deficit by 2011,
through a range of well-identified and detailed measures to be gradually phased in beginning
2006/07. On the revenue side, the recent reforms to the income tax law have begun to bear
fruit, with preliminary estimates showing higher revenue intake, reflecting an increased
number of taxpayers (due to reduced tax evasion) and larger average per-tax receipts (due to
stronger economic activity). In addition, efforts are underway to broaden the tax base and
improve tax buoyancy, by transforming the GST into a unified VAT with a single rate and
streamlining of property and stamp taxes, and reinforce expenditure control through the
institution of a Treasury Single Account (TSA).
5.
Revenue measures would be complemented by decisive action on the expenditure side.
Measures on this front focus on rationalizing the wage bill through reforms that would slow
the drift in wages, and on streamlining the subsidy bill, particularly the fuel subsidies, which
are poorly targeted. The authorities recognize that this basket of expenditure reforms is
politically sensitive and would require broad public consensus for successful implementation.
As such, while the non-inclusion of the adjustment measures in the 2006/07 budget was
motivated by political economy considerations, a targeted fuel price increase is contemplated,
along with the streamlining of the food subsidy bill. Progress with subsidy reforms, however,
would need to coincide with measures to strengthen the social safety net and institute adequate
compensatory schemes. In this respect, the authorities are planning to expand coverage of the
social safety net and improve its targeting of low-income households through a means-tested
system.
6.
The authorities are in agreement with staff on the importance of fiscal adjustment to
firmly reduce government debt and create the fiscal space for growth-enhancing investments.
It is important to note, however, that the ‘baseline’ scenario of a one percent adjustment per
year up to 2011 reflects the authorities’ conservative estimate of the impact of the ongoing and
contemplated reform measures. Should the envisaged full package of measures outlined by
staff be introduced, the adjustment could very well approximate the 1.5 percent predicated in
the ‘ambitious’ scenario. In fact, accounting for the absence of exceptional revenues in
2006/07, the projected deficit of 8.1 percent implies an even larger adjustment effort compared
to 2005/06. Nonetheless, and as staff point out, even in the baseline scenario, the level of
external debt would pursue a declining trajectory still in the face of shocks. Moreover, the
structure of the domestic public debt, with its longer term maturity and its investor base,
mitigates any potential vulnerabilities.

3

Monetary, Exchange Rate, and External Sector Issues
7.
The authorities are committed to a monetary policy framework that promotes price
stability, and are intent on adopting a formal inflation targeting framework once the requisite
institutional and analytical infrastructures are in place. In the meantime, monetary policy
formulation continues to improve, underpinned by a more proactive interest rate policy, to
render it more forward-looking and provide better guidance to the market. In this connection,
the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) launched an interest rate corridor in June 2005, with the
overnight interbank rate as the operational target. With the width narrowed from 300 bps at
inception to 200 bps in October 2005, the corridor has been effective in significantly reducing
interest volatility and guiding market expectations. Predictability and transparency of
monetary policy have improved, with interest rate decisions being determined by the Monetary
Policy Committee (MPC), which meets regularly every six weeks. These meetings are
followed by a monetary policy statement communicated to the public. Moreover, the CBE
liquidity management toolkit was expanded with the issuance of its own securities (CBE
notes) in August 2005.
8.
Monetary policy throughout 2005 and early 2006 remained attuned to developments in
indicative monetary aggregates and inflation indicators, as well as developments in credit
growth. With inflation stabilizing at around 4-5 percent, in part induced by the appreciation of
the exchange rate, real interest rates turned highly positive. Partly reflecting concerns over the
sluggish growth in private sector credit, the CBE lowered its policy rates successively until
April 2006. These rates, however, were not immediately reflected in bank lending rates, where
spreads remained high and credit growth timid. This may suggest an excessively cautious
lending stance by commercial banks following the credit excesses of the late 1990s, which is
expected to be mitigated by the wide-ranging structural reforms currently ongoing in the
banking sector. In the last MPC meeting in May 2006, interest rates were left unchanged, with
the CBE adopting a vigilant stance regarding the course of key indicative targets.
9.
Since its introduction in December 2004, the interbank foreign exchange market has
been operating smoothly and efficiently, without any intervention from the CBE. Reflecting
increased confidence in CBE’s management, as well as significant capital inflows, the
Egyptian pound appreciated against the US dollar by over 7 percent in 2005, following a
period of overshooting in the previous year, and stabilized within a narrow range. With the
sizable surpluses on the balance of payments, the CBE further bolstered its reserve position,
which has risen to US$23 billion (equivalent to more than seven months of imports). However,
it is important to underscore that the CBE is not seeking to stabilize the rate. In large measure,
the apparent stability reflects the underlying structure of the market, where traditionally Suez
Canal and hydrocarbon foreign exchange receipts are transacted outside of the market,
whereas excesses in banks are mopped up by the CBE to help them conform with regulatory
ceilings on their open positions. Moreover, the authorities have indicated their willingness to
tolerate fluctuations in the exchange rate, provided these are induced by fundamentals and not
by one-time factors, such as portfolio shifts related to increased confidence in the domestic
currency, and volatile capital flows associated with activity in asset markets. As underscored
by staff, tempering exchange rate fluctuations of a temporary nature is a legitimate policy

4

concern to help protect the exportable sectors, until the structural shifts currently underway in
the economy take hold. Going forward, upward pressure on the exchange rate is likely to
dissipate, as the accelerated growth erodes the surplus on the current account, and the
compressed interest rate differentials soothe portfolio flows.
Financial Sector Reforms
10.
Perhaps one of the most significant achievements in 2005 relates to the financial sector
in general, and the banking sector in particular. The cornerstone of the Financial Sector
Reform Program, to be implemented over 2005-08, rests on a major public sector restructuring
in the banking and non-banking sectors. The program aims to build a more competitive
financial sector, able in the medium-term to provide modern and efficient financial
intermediation, including by strengthening the enabling environment for resource mobilization
to support greater corporate activity. The program continues to be on track, and in some cases,
even ahead of schedule. In the banking sector, consolidation has advanced with the number of
banks reduced from 57 in 2004 to 43, through 7 merger operations involving 14 banks. The
plan is to further reduce the number of banks to 34 by end-2007. In addition, shares in 12 of 17
shareholdings of state-owned banks in joint-venture banks have been divested, representing 94
percent of total market value in joint-venture ownership. The privatization of Bank of
Alexandria (Egypt’s fourth largest bank with 7 percent of system deposits) is almost complete,
with the invitation for expression of interest published in the international press in March
2006. More importantly, the authorities recognize that the resolution of the large stock of nonperforming loans (NPL) would considerably strengthen the system’s capacity for financial
intermediation. In this respect, settlement agreements representing 46 percent of private sector
NPL have been reached, and a scheme to deal with state-owned enterprises NPL was outlined,
with defined resources from privatization proceeds earmarked to this effect.
Privatization and Structural Reform Issues

The government has considerably stepped up the pace of its privatization program.
Since the adoption of the Asset Management Program (AMP) by the Ministry of Investment in
July 2004, state ownership in 77 assets was transferred to the private sector. Of these, 49
transactions took place between July 2005 and March 2006 alone, yielding proceeds of US$2.5
billion that are well in excess of those recorded in the preceding five years combined. The pick
up in privatization involved a series of IPOs which were positively received by the markets,
and contributed to an increased diversification of the investor base. In December 2005, the IPO
for Egypt Telecom was launched on the Cairo Stock and London Stock Exchanges, offering 20
percent of the state’s stake in the landline operator. Ten percent of the stake was made
available to institutional investors and was 45 times oversubscribed, while the remaining 10
percent was offered to small investors and witnessed a three-fold oversubscription. The Egypt
Telecom IPO is the largest for the Middle East and North Africa region to be listed on an
international exchange in 2005. Other important privatization transactions in the pipeline
include the sale of the state’s stake in one of its major oil refineries, Middle East for Oil
Refinement (MEDOR), expected within year-end. As also noted by staff, the allocation of the

5

privatization proceeds is transparent, with a good portion being retained by line and functional
ministries to restructure remaining enterprises.

The government is actively pursuing reforms to strengthen the business climate, by
addressing the bottlenecks caused by red tape and cumbersome taxation. Recognizing the
scope of the customs reforms introduced last year, Egypt has been ranked first by the World
Bank’s Global Competitiveness Report in customs procedures reform. This reflects the
facilitation of commercial documentation procedures and the reduction in the number of
customs approvals from 26 to only 5. Moreover, legislation is currently being drafted to set up
specialized economic courts, to circumvent bureaucratic hurdles and streamline the judicial
framework governing business contracts. In the same vein, a ministerial committee has also
been established to expedite dispute settlement procedures with the private sector.

Finally, the Egyptian authorities are committed to the vigorous pursuit of their reform
agenda to achieve a structurally higher growth. They would like to express their appreciation
for the extensive and highly valuable technical assistance they are receiving from the Fund in
support of their reform efforts, and thank staff for a productive consultation and well-balanced
report. They look forward to continued close collaboration with the Fund in the period ahead.
