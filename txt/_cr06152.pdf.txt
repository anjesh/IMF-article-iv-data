March 6, 2006
•

The 2005 Article IV consultation discussions were held in Windhoek during November 2-15,
2005. Staff met with Finance Minister Kuugongelwa-Amadhila and Deputy Finance Minister
Tweya; Governor Alweendo and Deputy Governor Hartmann of the Bank of Namibia (BoN);
other senior government officials; Members of Parliament; representatives of the private
sector; NGOs; labor unions; and members of the diplomatic and academic communities.

•

The staff team comprised Mr. Mueller (head, AFR), Mr. Clausen, Mr. Dwight, Ms. Strauss
(all AFR), and Mr. Ramcharan (RES). The mission partially overlapped with the FSAP
mission. The FSAP recommendations were finalized and discussed with the authorities in
February 2006.

•

The Executive Board concluded the 2004 Article IV consultation on February 14, 2005.
Directors commended Namibia’s record of macroeconomic stability and welcomed the recent
rise in growth, decline in inflation, and strengthening of external accounts. Directors
emphasized the need to reduce the fiscal deficit through expenditure restraint and civil service
reform. They observed that the exchange rate peg had served Namibia well but noted the
importance of maintaining adequate international reserves. Directors also stressed the
importance of addressing HIV/AIDS, high unemployment, and large disparities of income.

•

The authorities have recently become more receptive to Fund policy advice, especially on
fiscal policy and financial sector issues. This is also reflected in their requests for an FSAP
and a fiscal ROSC and several technical assistance missions, which were received following
last year’s Article IV discussions.

•

Namibia fixes its currency at par to the South African rand, which is also legal tender.

•

Namibia has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2(a), 3, and 4 and maintains an
exchange system free of restrictions on the making of transfers and payments of current
account transactions.

•

Appendices I and II summarize Namibia’s relations with the Fund and the World Bank group,
respectively. Section III and Appendix III discuss statistical issues. Appendices IV and V
present the external and fiscal debt sustainability analyses.

•

The Selected Issues Papers include studies on: (i) the link between education and
unemployment; (ii) the dimensions of poverty and policy options to address them; (iii) the
sustainability of the pension system; and (iv) the pros and cons of Namibia joining a
monetary union.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Namibia has maintained a strong record of macroeconomic stability since
independence. This record has been based on a credible peg to the South African rand,
generally prudent fiscal policies, a stable political environment, a fairly developed
infrastructure, and a strong legal and regulatory environment. It is also reflected in recent
economic performance, with robust real GDP growth, falling inflation, a high external
current account surplus, and continued low external indebtedness. However, outflows on the
capital and financial accounts continued, as financial institutions invested heavily in South
Africa. This has kept reserves at relatively low levels. Namibia recently received an
investment grade rating on sovereign debt from Fitch.
Despite these accomplishments, major challenges–including widespread poverty, high
unemployment, and HIV/AIDS–remain. One-fourth of the population does not get
sufficient dietary consumption, the unemployment rate exceeds 20 percent, and the
prevalence of HIV/AIDS is about 20 percent.
The authorities recognized they need to tackle these challenges and raise Namibia’s
long-term growth potential. They have identified education reform as key and are
examining ways to boost student enrollment and the quality of teaching and instructional
materials. The discussions also focused on ways to boost the flexibility of labor markets,
improve the performance of parastatals and limit their impact on the budget, clarify land
reform, enhance governance, combat the HIV/AIDS pandemic, and alleviate poverty.
The authorities reiterated their commitment to reduce the fiscal deficit. The 2004/05
fiscal deficit was higher than expected, at 4 percent of GDP, due mainly to shortfalls in VAT
collections and an increase in the wage bill. The public debt-to-GDP ratio rose to
33½ percent at fiscal year-end 2004/05. Nonetheless, the authorities intend to bring the
budget into balance over the medium-term and maintain their fiscal rule targeting a debt-toGDP ratio at 25 percent, without, however, specifying how the adjustment is to be achieved.
The mission stressed the importance of realistic budgets and a credible fiscal policy rule. It
projected a slower medium-term fiscal adjustment path in light of the authorities’ difficulties
in reining in and reorienting spending and enhancing tax administration. This may require
that the authorities consider raising the debt target, at an appropriate time. The mission urged
the authorities to limit the fiscal deficit to 3 percent of GDP in 2005/06.
In 2005, the Bank of Namibia (BoN) continued to lower the bank rate, consistent with
developments in South Africa and the peg to the rand. In doing so, the BoN eliminated
the negative interest rate differential vis-à-vis the anchor currency. Discussions focused on
ways to boost international reserves, including through creating greater domestic investment
opportunities and sterilizing purchases of foreign exchange. Staff also urged the authorities
not to rule out establishing a positive interest rate differential with respect to South Africa.
The authorities welcomed the recommendations of the recently concluded FSAP. These
focused on measures to ensure compliance with the Basel Core Principles, strengthen the
regulatory framework for non-bank financial institutions, expand domestic investment
opportunities, and improve access to financial services.

I. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
1.
Namibia’s economy recorded growth above its historical average in 2004
(Table 1). Real GDP grew 6 percent, exceeding growth in most neighbors and the average of
Sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries. Diamond production increased almost 40 percent,
driven by new marine mining technologies. Other mining, mineral processing, transport and
communication, and subsistence agriculture also contributed to growth. However, a
strengthened currency hit the fishing and commercial agriculture industries.

2.
Growth slowed in 2005. Diamond production fell relative to the high production
base of the previous year, while growth rates in other mining moderated somewhat. Higher
oil prices affected the transportation sector in particular. However, solid activity occurred in
manufacturing, agriculture, and the wholesale and retail trade sectors, aided by a decline in
interest rates (see below).
3.
Inflation moderated in 2004 and 2005, due to good rains and an appreciated
currency. Average inflation fell to 4¼ percent in 2004 and only 2¼ percent for JanuaryNovember 2005.
4.
Namibia’s external current account remained solidly in surplus, peaking at
more than 10 percent of GDP in 2004 (Table 2). Surging diamond exports and buoyant
customs union (SACU) receipts, which increased by one-third in 2004, more than offset a
large increase in imports, including oil imports.1

1

Oil imports amounted to 4¾ percent of GDP in 2002-04 but are estimated to have jumped to
6¾ percent of GDP in 2005.

In tandem with the South African rand, the Namibia dollar appreciated in 2004
before depreciating somewhat in 2005. The impact on effective exchange rates was muted
as Namibia trades four-fifths of its imports and one-third of its exports with South Africa.

Outflows on the capital and financial accounts remained high as banks, pension
funds, and insurance companies invested heavily in South African financial markets.
International reserves fell to 1¾ months of imports in 2004 and 40 percent of short-term debt
in 2003, below standard benchmarks.2 Total external debt is estimated to have fallen to
23 percent of GDP at end-2004, as parastatals in particular reduced their borrowing.

Although improving significantly over the previous year, the fiscal deficit for
2004/05 was 4 percent of GDP, higher than expected and higher than the deficits of
Namibia’s southern African neighbors (Table 3). A one-time windfall in SACU receipts
and increased tax revenues from personal income and diamonds contributed to the
improvement over 2003/04. By contrast, VAT collections were 2¼ percent of GDP lower
than budgeted owing to continued administrative problems. Similarly, the government wage
bill was ½ percent of GDP higher than budgeted as the hiring freeze was not implemented
consistently across all ministries. These developments pushed the public debt ratio to
33½ percent of GDP, well above the government’s target of 25 percent.

Namibia’s monetary policy is determined by the peg to the South African rand
(Box 1). Since early 2003, the BoN has reduced the Bank Rate in steps from 12¾ to
7 percent in tandem with reductions in South Africa’s policy rate. In the process, the BoN
removed the negative interest rate differential vis-à-vis South Africa. Reflecting lower
interest rates, credit to the private sector grew 19½ percent in 2004 and 20¼ percent year-onyear in September 2005 (Table 4).

Box 1. Namibia’s Exchange Rate Peg
Namibia is a member of the Common Monetary Area (CMA), which also comprises South
Africa, Lesotho, and Swaziland. Like the other small CMA members, Namibia pegs its currency
to the South African rand, which also serves as legal tender. Each CMA member has its own
central bank and responsibility for foreign exchange transactions within its territories. A
bilateral agreement with South Africa requires Namibia to back its currency 100 percent with
foreign exchange. The backing stood at 190 percent at end-September 2005.

The peg has helped maintain macroeconomic
stability; integrate Namibia’s economy with that of
its neighbors; and promoted trade, financial
development, and free flows of capital with South
Africa. The peg also links Namibia to South Africa’s
inflation targeting framework, and in the last two
years Namibia’s and South Africa’s inflation rates
have converged. The Bank of Namibia has used the
limited flexibility under the peg to maintain, over an
extended period, a negative interest rate differential
relative to South Africa’s key policy rate, to promote
economic development. Consistent with Fund policy
advice, this differential was eliminated in 2004 to
safeguard international reserves.
The peg has subjected Namibia to exchange rate
volatility as the rand experienced extensive periods
of sharp depreciation (during 2000-02) and
appreciation (during 2002-04). In addition,
Namibia’s terms of trade have been negatively
correlated with South Africa’s during the last decade.
While a large portion of Namibia’s non-diamond
exports goes to South Africa and four-fifths of its
imports originate there, South Africa’s trade pattern
is much more diversified.

II. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Overview
9.
Namibia’s transition to a new government and new president proceeded
smoothly in 2005. President Pohamba assumed office in March and his party, SWAPO, now
holds three-quarters of the seats in parliament. The new administration has expressed a
determination to address corruption, reduce poverty, curb public spending, and improve
public services. President Pohamba’s election has been accompanied by a new openness.
Namibians are debating where their country stands after 15 years of independence and the
press is willing to criticize the government. The recent uncovering of several corruption
scandals seems to reflect this new atmosphere rather than a worsening of government
malfeasance.
10.
The new government has reiterated its commitment to macroeconomic stability,
which has also been recognized by international financial markets. In January 2006,
Namibia received an investment grade rating of BBB- for long-term foreign currency from
Fitch in its first sovereign rating. The authorities see the rating as a useful benchmark but
have no current plans to borrow on international markets.
11.
However, the authorities repeatedly raised the issue of Namibia’s classification
as a middle-income country. They argued this hinders their ability to obtain concessional
financing and address Namibia’s development needs. They stressed that per-capita GDP is a
misleading indicator as the basis for donor support and does not adequately reflect Namibia’s
wide-spread poverty, unemployment, and HIV/AIDS—problems similar to those in other
SSA countries.
12.
Against this background of a smooth political transition and the new
government's commitment to macroeconomic stability and economic development, the
discussions focused on:
•
•
•
•
•

Addressing Namibia’s medium-term challenges to growth.
Achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and reducing poverty.
Pursuing a prudent fiscal policy.
Maintaining the exchange rate peg and building international reserves.
Addressing issues identified by the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP).

There was broad agreement between the authorities and staff on the key policy
recommendations.

B. Economic Prospects and Risks
13.
The authorities expect growth to moderate to 3½ to 4 percent over the mediumterm (Table 5). While external demand would remain a key determinant of growth and help
safeguard the current account surplus, the authorities expected domestic demand to
strengthen as well. In the staff’s view, these projections are feasible provided the authorities
pursue appropriate macroeconomic and structural policies. In 2006 and 2007, growth should
accelerate with the introduction of new technologies to mine diamonds (i.e., dredging),
increased zinc production, and development of the Kudu gas field.
14.
Potential downside risks could emanate from policy actions or external shocks.3
On the policy side, insufficient attention to reducing fiscal deficits could negatively affect the
economy. On the external side, risks include a fall in the price or demand for mineral exports,
a rise in the exchange rate or oil prices, or shocks to South Africa that affect trade or
financial flows. Other risks could arise from social tensions related to land reform or lack of
progress in reducing poverty. The external and fiscal debt sustainability analyses suggest
Namibia faces only moderate risks from external and public sector debt, if appropriate
policies are pursued. However, a passive fiscal policy scenario combined with a less
favorable macroeconomic environment could quickly lead to unsustainable public debt levels
(Appendices IV and V).

3

An alternative scenario is presented in the lower panel of Table 5.

- 11 -

C. Medium-Term Challenges to Growth
15.
Given Namibia’s dual economy and the constraints imposed by the exchange
rate peg, the authorities need to embark upon additional structural reforms to raise
Namibia’s long-term growth potential, boost investment, and address the problems of
poverty, income inequality, and unemployment (Box 2). The authorities recognize that
they need to tackle these challenges. In this regard, a Cabinet retreat in November 2005
provided a forum to discuss various policy options. The authorities reiterated their
commitment to prudent macroeconomic policies, with a focus on preserving Namibia’s
relatively low public debt ratio compared to other SSA countries.

Box 2. Namibia’s Macroeconomic Context
Namibia’s per-capita income is among the
highest in Sub-Saharan Africa, but its income
distribution is highly skewed. This reflects the
existence of a dual economy with a
sophisticated modern sector, based on highly
capital-intensive mining activities and
commercial farming, alongside a large
informal sector, mostly comprising subsistence
farming. The modern sector is behind much of
Namibia’s economic growth and high
investment rates. In particular, diamond
production and investment in new mining
technology have driven the volatility of
Namibia’s growth rates over the last few years.

Pension contributions from the modern and large public sectors have contributed to
Namibia’s high savings rate, with assets of pension funds and insurance companies of
around 100 percent of GDP. These funds have largely been channeled to South Africa’s
deeper financial markets due to the lack of investment opportunities in Namibia, leaving
international reserves at low levels. The accompanying FSSA analyzes the financial sector
and its linkages to South Africa.
With a limited ability to exercise an independent monetary policy under the exchange rate
peg, fiscal policy is the main macroeconomic policy tool. Fiscal policy has generally been
prudent—notwithstanding important slippages in recent years—and geared toward
containing Namibia’s relatively low public debt ratio. These policy constraints, together
with the recent extended period of appreciation, have prompted a realization among the
authorities that bold structural reforms are needed to help the economy adjust and raise
Namibia’s long-term growth potential. Such reforms could also boost the attractiveness of
Namibia for domestic and foreign investment.

- 12 -

16.
In prioritizing reforms, there was agreement that strengthening the quality of
education would be crucial. Other important areas of reform include: addressing the impact
of immigration restrictions and the Labor Act on labor market flexibility,
reforming/restructuring parastatals, making land reform more transparent, and improving
governance. The mission also encouraged the authorities to take steps to improve the
environment for private sector activity, promote export diversification, and make their views
known in trade negotiations.
17.
The authorities have identified education reform as key to raising skill levels,
bolstering growth, and reducing unemployment.4 There is a widespread perception that
the quality of primary and secondary education is low and tertiary institutions do not produce
enough students with the right skills. Incentives for firms to provide on-the-job training are
low. The World Bank has been assisting the government in developing an education sector
strategy.5 The reforms would focus on raising school enrollment rates, enhancing the quality
of teaching, reducing teachers’ absences, providing adequate instructional materials,
developing education standards, and introducing measures to evaluate outcomes. The
mission welcomed the authorities’ commitment to education reform, noting that skills
development contributes to total factor productivity growth and, ultimately, economic
growth. In addition, the mission saw merit in promoting vocational training, which had been
stigmatized by its apartheid legacy, and revising curricula to meet the demands of the labor
market.
18.
The mission urged the authorities to enhance the flexibility of labor markets by
revisiting immigration restrictions and affirmative action rules. Private sector
representatives consistently complained that tightened immigration procedures and
requirements for Namibianization have hindered their ability to find qualified employees.
The authorities justified the tightened procedures, stating that firms should be able to find
Namibians to fill most positions and that Namibianization is necessary to overcome the
legacy of apartheid. They also felt some firms had not expended sufficient efforts to train
Namibians. The mission took note of the social goals served by Namibianization but stressed
that as a small country, Namibia would likely need to look abroad for individuals with
essential skills not found at home.
19.
The government has held up implementation of some recently approved
amendments to the Labor Act of 1992 pending review of contentious provisions (Box 3).
Employers welcomed measures to streamline procedures for dismissal but feared that
additional leave days would reduce productivity and increase labor costs. Labor unions
argued that because the process that produced the Act was consultative, the government
4

Chapter I of the Selected Issues Paper discusses the link between education and unemployment.

However, the authorities have been hesitant to consider a loan agreement on IBRD terms as they
fear a non-concessional loan would deter other donors from providing concessional aid.

- 13 -

should fully implement the legislation. The mission supported the authorities’ decision to
review the amendments, pointing to the need to safeguard the competitiveness of Namibian
companies. It also suggested the authorities consider exempting firms below a certain size
from the leave provisions of the Labor Act.
Box 3: Highlights of the New Labor Law
After five years of consultations between the government, employees, and unions, parliament
passed a new Labor Act in September 2005. The legislation revamps the dispute resolution
process and workers’ benefits. Key features include:
•

Streamlined procedures to dismiss employees: Under the current regime, firms can
dismiss workers in cases of misconduct or, following consultation with the Labor
Commissioner, when the company experiences economic problems. However,
dismissal is cumbersome and lengthy in cases of performance problems. Such cases
often got caught in the court system for years. The amendments allow the Labor
Commissioner to refer disputes regarding alleged unfair dismissals to arbitration rather
than the courts (although parties can later appeal to the courts).

•

Increased leave days: The law increases minimum vacation days from 18 to 24.
Employees are also given 30 days of sick leave, 12 weeks of paid maternity leave, and
5 paid compassionate leave days in case of death or serious illness in the family.

20.
The mission pressed the authorities to develop a clear roadmap for restructuring
and/or divesting parastatals (Box 4). The authorities had made little progress in this area,
and subsidies to public enterprises, in particular Air Namibia, averaged 2¼ percent of GDP
over the last five years. The mission stressed that subsidies divert resources away from
higher return projects and allow parastatals to compete unfairly with private firms. In
addition, guarantees to parastatals could expose future budgets to contingent liabilities. The
mission suggested that privatization could improve services and help reduce government
debt and that allowing foreign investors to participate could facilitate the import of
technology and boost international reserves. The mission perceived a heightened sense of
urgency among the authorities to reevaluate the role of parastatals and take action. As a first
step, the State-Owned Enterprise Act was adopted in January 2006, aimed at harmonizing the
operational framework for parastatals and tightening fiscal control over them. Over the
medium-term, the authorities did not rule out privatization or some role for foreign
investment but emphasized that public enterprises should continue to provide key services,
such as water and electricity.

- 14 -

Box 4: Namibian Parastatals - Stylized Facts
Namibia has more than 40 parastatals engaged in commercial activities. However, many
receive substantial subsidies. Most of these subsidies have been to enterprises operating in
competitive sectors, in particular Air Namibia. There is little rationale for subsidizing
enterprises in these sectors. In addition, staff analysis indicates that the profitability of
Namibia’s parastatals declines as the competitiveness of the operating sector increases.
Specifically, in 2001 parastatals operating in competitive industries had negative returns to
equity that were four times larger than the positive returns of parastatals operating in industries
with natural monopolies (p-value=0.06). In this light, continuing subsidies to parastatals in
competitive industries is not expected to make them profitable or self-sufficient. Thus,
reducing subsidies and redirecting public expenditures to priority sectors may improve welfare.

21.
The authorities clarified their approach to land reform, emphasizing they are
proceeding in accordance with the Constitution and the Land Act of 1995 and that
land-owners can challenge expropriations in court. Namibia’s “willing buyer, willing
seller” policy for purchasing and redistributing commercial land in the south has proceeded
slowly.6 Moreover, due to adverse climate, lack of skills and finance, and small farm size,
many of the resettled farms are unprofitable. The authorities have recently initiated
expropriations against compensation of 20 farms under a more aggressive approach.
However, they are awaiting resolution of these cases through negotiations and the courts
before proceeding further. The mission urged the government to base land reform on
objective and transparent criteria, such as the underutilization of land, so as not to hinder
investment or adversely affect agricultural output. The authorities did not fear such
6

- 15 -

consequences, but stated they would monitor the situation. The mission stressed that resettled
farmers should be provided with appropriate skills, as well as access to finance, equipment,
and other inputs. It also noted that optimizing the use of communal land in the north could
improve the livelihood of much larger segments of the population than resettlement.
22.
The authorities pointed to recent efforts to enhance governance. An AntiCorruption Commission (ACC) was established in June 2005 and its members appointed in
late 2005 to investigate instances of corruption, bribery, use of public resources for private
gain, and rigged tenders. The mission stressed the importance of giving the ACC adequate
resources and making it fully operational in 2006.
23.
The World Bank’s Doing Business database suggests that Namibia’s business
environment lags behind the developed world, but is on a par with many countries in
the region. Namibia ranked a relatively favorable 33 out of 155 economies, but ranked low
on starting a business (76th) and the ease of registering property (118th). The mission
suggested steps to simplify business regulations and cut red tape, with a particular view to
promoting the emergence of SMEs. This would complement the FSAP’s recommendations
on improving access to finance (see below). The authorities were receptive to these
suggestions, as they also saw SMEs as a potential vehicle to diversify the economy and
provide jobs in rural areas.
24.
The authorities were eager to promote export diversification. They saw scope to
develop agro-industries, aquaculture, high-end tourism, electricity production, and some
niche industries such as cement and small-scale processing of diamonds, other minerals, and
leather products. They hoped Namibia’s strong economic performance and structural reforms
could help attract foreign investors. However, they have become more cautious with respect
to providing tax incentives, following disappointing efforts to develop a textile industry.7 The
mission suggested that the private sector take the lead on diversifying Namibia’s exports.
However, the government could play a role by creating a level playing field and
implementing the structural reforms to facilitate the emergence of new production and export
opportunities.
25.
The mission urged Namibia to take a more active stance in trade negotiations in
order to foster its growth and export objectives, and aim at promoting trade flows
through a reduction in the average tariff. Namibia participates in negotiations between the
Southern African Development Community (SADC) and the EU on the Economic
Partnership for Africa (EPA) and in negotiations between the SACU and the United States on
a free trade agreement.
7

The authorities are currently reviewing tax incentives in economic processing zones (EPZs) and
have changed the decision process for granting such incentives. Decisions are now taken by an interministerial committee, with the Ministry of Finance formally represented. The authorities expect these
changes to ensure a broader and more thorough assessment of costs and benefits.

- 16 -

D. Reaching the MDGs and Tackling Poverty
26.
The mission commended the authorities for incorporating the MDGs into their
long-term strategy (Table 6). Namibia is on track to meet some targets, such as
environmental sustainability and gender equality, ahead of schedule. However, Namibia lags
in other areas such as poverty reduction, education, and health and, on current trends, is
likely to miss key MDGs by 2015.8
27.
The mission welcomed the successful

stepped-up efforts to reduce HIV infections.
The mission commended the authorities for their mass awareness campaigns.
28.
A coalition of churches, NGOs, and unions has proposed the introduction of a
Basic Income Grant, BIG (Box 5).10 The mission discussed this proposal with the coalition
as well as the government. The coalition felt that the BIG could significantly reduce poverty
at minimal administrative cost. The government had not yet taken a position on the proposal
but expressed concerns about the budgetary cost and the impact on incentives to work.

8

Lack of recent data on household income and unemployment hampered the analysis. Current data
are based on a household survey from 1994 and labor survey from 2002. The authorities expect new
surveys to be released in 2006.
9

See Chapter I in IMF Country Report No. 05/96 on the impact of HIV/AIDS on growth. The
analysis concluded that slippages in the implementation of structural reforms and of the MTP III
strategy would lower economic growth by one percent of GDP per year over the next five years as a
result of lower contributions of human capital and total factor productivity.

See Selected Issues Paper, Chapter II for the feasibility of a cash grant to address poverty.

Box 5: The Basic Income Grant (BIG)
The BIG coalition proposes a monthly cash grant of N$100 (US$15) for all Namibians below
60 years of age, regardless of income. This would move the majority of the population above
the poverty line. The grant would also help improve basic nutrition levels which in turn could
increase the productivity of the work force and the effectiveness of HIV/AIDS treatment. The
BIG coalition maintained that a universal grant would not discourage people from working, but
enable them to overcome a vicious circle of poverty and unemployment. As the needs of
Namibia’s poor are urgent, the coalition favored a quick rollout of the program. In their view,
the BIG would also avoid the usual problems of targeting cash grants and limit possibilities for
abuse. The administrative cost of the distribution system (smart cards, bank accounts, and fixed
payout points in rural areas) would be less than 10 percent. The economy would benefit
through increased consumption, which would serve as an engine for rural economic
development.
The BIG coalition estimates the cost of their proposal at 2¼ to 3¾ percent of GDP. It contends
that this could be recouped through a 7 percentage point increase in the VAT and an increase in
the income tax. The financing would redistribute income as the rich consume more than the
poor and pay more in increased VAT and income tax than they would receive as a cash grant.

29.
The mission recognized the need to provide an adequate social safety net, but
considered that the BIG could compromise fiscal sustainability. According to staff
calculations, financing the BIG through the VAT would be more costly than the BIG
coalition contends and would require increasing the tax rate by at least 15 percentage points,
to 30 percent, at a cost of 5½ percent of GDP. In addition, a large VAT increase could have
high distortionary costs, given the narrow tax base. The mission brought up the example of
other countries which have succeeded with cash grants that link payments to promotion of
the MDGs, thereby fighting both current and future poverty.11 Such grants could be more
affordable as well. The mission recommended that any grant scheme be implemented
gradually to contain costs, gain experience, and tackle administrative obstacles. The
authorities agreed that any new program should be linked to a review of existing social safety
net programs to achieve synergies and free up resources. In this context, staff analysis
indicates that the cost of the non-contributory pension grant paid to all Namibians aged 60 or
older is limited and the system is sustainable.12

11

For example, in Mexico and Brazil, cash grants are conditional on school enrollment and regular
visits to health clinics to boost education and health.
12

See Selected Issues Paper, Chapter III for details.

- 19 -

E. Fiscal Policy
30.
The authorities reiterated their commitment to a prudent fiscal policy. Following
the higher-than-expected deficit and problems with budget monitoring in 2004/05, they
stated their intention to take corrective actions, by increasing revenues, particularly from the
VAT, and restraining expenditures, particularly personnel spending.13 The authorities
remained optimistic about achieving their deficit target of 2¼ percent of GDP for 2005/06
and moving toward a balanced budget over the medium term (Box 6).

Box 6: The Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF)
The authorities project balanced budgets for 2006/07 and 2007/08 in their MTEF. This would
reduce the public debt-to-GDP ratio from 33½ to 27 percent, on track to achieve the authorities’
target of 25 percent by the end of the decade. This adjustment would be based on a significant
reduction in expenditure, which would decline by one-sixth in terms of GDP over three years.
The authorities explained that the MTEF is designed to reduce the public debt ratio to the targeted
level but does not specify what steps the government would take to achieve this target. The
authorities agreed that the MTEF targets are ambitious and that the envisioned drop in
expenditure would be difficult to achieve. Staff project that the fiscal deficit will decline only
gradually, from 3¾ percent of GDP in 2005/06 to 2½ percent of GDP by 2007/08, taking into
account the impact of efforts to strengthen tax administration and rein in wages and subsidies.

Budget monitoring suffered from double-counting of some revenues, lack of information on
collection of non-tax revenues, and delayed reporting of expenditures. To address these concerns, the
Ministry of Finance has introduced a pilot real-time monitoring system.

- 20 -

31.
The mission expressed concern that deficit reduction had fallen short of
objectives. It noted that fiscal adjustment was necessary to support the exchange rate peg
and that the decline in interest rates created an opportunity to address the fiscal deficit at
minimum risk to economic growth. The mission also underscored the importance of realistic
budgets. It projected the 2005/06 budget deficit at 3¾ percent of GDP, reflecting possible
expenditure overruns on subsidies and the wage bill. It urged the authorities to aim at a lower
deficit of around 3 percent of GDP, by restraining spending and enhancing budget
monitoring and control systems. If these measures proved sufficient to limit the deficit to
3 percent of GDP, the mission supported the government’s intention not to table a
supplementary budget in 2005/06, as supplementary budgets had tended to erode fiscal
discipline. The authorities stressed they would take the steps necessary to secure a deficit
close to the original target.
32.
While tax revenue fell short of expectations in 2004/05, the authorities pointed to
strong tax collections from corporations and individuals for the first half of 2005/06.
They attributed the increase to forensic audits of corporations carried out by private auditors,
which have enhanced tax compliance, and stepped-up collection of personal income taxes.
The mission welcomed the increased collections but urged a more systematic strengthening
of tax administration to help counter the projected medium-term decline in SACU receipts.
In this regard, the Fund will provide technical assistance (TA).14

43 percent of spending and 14¾ percent of GDP, well above the average for SSA
countries.15 Efforts to contain personnel expenditure included a hiring freeze, and limiting

increases in civil service wages and benefits. The mission recommended that wage increases
be limited to the inflation rate. Recognizing civil servant wages are a key source of income
for extended families, the mission did not advocate layoffs. Instead, it recommended
developing a strategy to determine the appropriate structure and remuneration of the civil
service. The strategy should consider reallocating staff across ministries, eliminating
redundant government functions, and reducing staff through attrition.

The authorities are considering ways to modify the administration of oil prices
through the National Energy Fund (NEF). They currently adjust retail oil prices quarterly,
but a limited pass-through of price increases in 2005 reduced the NEF’s reserves. The
authorities are considering switching to monthly price adjustments. The mission suggested
revisiting the rationale for the NEF and urged its eventual termination, with a view to
allocating resources more efficiently and avoiding the need for budgetary subsidies.
36.
The mission noted the authorities would have difficulty achieving the mediumterm debt target of 25 percent of GDP in light of a current debt level of 33½ percent of
GDP. The fiscal DSA suggests that even with moderate efforts to enhance revenue
performance and curtail spending, the ratio would stabilize at that level over the medium
term (Appendix V). Moreover, slower fiscal adjustment than contemplated by the baseline
scenario or the need to increase priority expenditures could make achieving the target
difficult. The mission supported a public benchmark to guide fiscal policy, but suggested that
the target ratio should be realistic, credible, and sufficiently ambitious. In that light, the
government could consider raising the target debt ratio, at an appropriate time, to an
achievable level. The mission suggested an appropriate ratio could be in the range of 3035 percent of GDP.
37.
The authorities shared the mission’s concern about the credibility of the public
debt target, but remained committed to a ratio of 25 percent of GDP. They felt an
ambitious target would better help maintain fiscal discipline. While recognizing they would
have difficulty meeting the target in the near future, the authorities feared raising it now
would undermine their ability to impose fiscal discipline.

- 22 -

F. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
38.
The authorities reiterated their commitment to maintaining the peg to the rand.
They acknowledged that the extended period of appreciation had put pressure on the
economy to adjust. However, available indicators, such as export market shares and export
performance, including of the non-mining sector, suggest the appreciation of 2002-04 has not
yet had a major negative impact on exports, growth, or employment, with a few exceptions.
Nonetheless, the mission stressed the importance of monitoring competitiveness and
recommended the authorities develop additional measures, such as unit labor costs.
39.
The mission urged the authorities to take steps toward increasing international
reserves so as to bring the reserves/short-term debt ratio and the import coverage of
reserves to more comfortable levels. The authorities noted, however, that on the basis of
other measures, foreign exchange reserves appeared sufficient. For example, reserves stood
at two times currency in circulation at end-2005.
40.
Creating greater domestic investment opportunities was seen as the best way to
raise international reserves. In this regard, the authorities appreciated the FSAP
recommendations (Box 7). However, they expressed reservations on the recommendation to
curtail domestic investment requirements, which they considered useful in channeling funds
to local investment and not harmful from a prudential point of view.
41.
The authorities expressed skepticism they could increase reserves through policy
actions, such as raising interest rates or purchasing foreign exchange. They argued that
entities that hold foreign assets, such as NBFIs, are not sensitive to short-term interest rates
set by the central bank. They also stressed that purchases of foreign exchange had not been
effective, as the additional liquidity in the local currency was ultimately returned to the BoN
for conversion into rand and invested in South Africa.
42.
While acknowledging these concerns, the mission emphasized that confidence in
the peg requires maintaining adequate reserves to guard against balance of payments
shocks. It urged the authorities not to rule out establishing a positive interest rate differential
vis-à-vis South Africa, particularly if pressure on the currency occurs. It argued that foreign
exchange intervention may not have been effective at accumulating reserves because the
BoN had not sterilized excess liquidity. The mission advised the BoN to systematically
enhance its capacity to manage short-term liquidity through open market operations, which
could facilitate such sterilization and help develop domestic money and foreign exchange
markets. More active liquidity management would also be desirable in light of the increasing
settlement of payments under the new national payments system.

Box 7: Namibia’s Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP)
The FSAP recommendations, detailed in the accompanying FSSA, focus on:
•

Upgrading the Supervisory and Regulatory Framework: With regard to banks,
Namibia meets most of the requirements of the Basel Core Principles, but gaps include
the lack of supervision of bank holding companies and financial groups, and the
absence of regulatory requirements on market and country risks. With regard to
nonbank financial institutions (NBFIs), the authorities should improve the capacity of
the sector’s regulatory body, NAMFISA. They should also subject specialized
financial institutions to supervision by the BoN. NAMFISA should compile and
analyze reliable data on NBFIs and be given a mandate to regulate market conduct.

•

Developing Domestic Investment Opportunities: The FSAP recommended the
authorities reconsider or drop proposals to: (i) compel additional investment in
domestic assets; and (ii) require NBFIs to invest 5 percent of their assets in unlisted
Namibian companies. Such measures could lower investment returns, direct funds to
unprofitable projects, and raise NBFIs’ risk exposures. To make domestic investments
more attractive, the FSAP proposed steps to develop domestic money and foreign
exchange markets and to promote securitization, leasing and factoring, and private
equity investment.

•

Improving Access to Financial Services: The FSAP recommended that the authorities:
(i) require banks to improve the transparency of their fees and charges; (ii) foster
greater competition by encouraging the development of PostBank and new financial
institutions such as credit unions; (iii) revisit the role and rationale of the specialized
financial institutions; and (iv) replace the Usury Act with a Consumer Credit Act.

43.
The mission welcomed the authorities’ studying ways to strengthen integration
within the region, including the possibility of a monetary union. It noted that establishing
a common central bank and common currency within the CMA could have benefits by giving
Namibia a greater voice in the setting of monetary policy, lowering transaction costs on trade
and capital flows, and eliminating the need to manage a separate pool of foreign exchange
reserves.16 However, as the Namibian authorities would no longer have the option to adjust
monetary policy or the exchange rate to respond to economic shocks, the government would
need to pursue appropriate fiscal policy and ensure flexibility of the labor and capital
markets. The authorities indicated that they would continue to study the issue, in conjunction
with other members of the CMA.

16

Chapter IV of the Selected Issues Paper contains a discussion of the pros and cons of joining a
monetary union.

- 24 -

G. Financial Sector Policies
44.
The FSAP concluded that Namibia has a stable and profitable financial sector,
although there are signs of vulnerabilities (Table 7). Financial intermediation is relatively
high. Banks are profitable and well capitalized, with capital adequacy ratios averaging
15 percent and nonperforming loans at only 3 percent. Stress tests confirmed the system’s
resilience to plausible macroeconomic shocks. However, vulnerabilities could arise from
large exposures to the real estate sector, the rapid growth of consumer and mortgage lending,
and spillovers from adverse financial sector developments in South Africa. While the
regulatory and supervisory frameworks for the financial sector were judged broadly
satisfactory, the FSAP identified weaknesses in their implementation, especially for NBFIs.
45.
The authorities expressed appreciation for, and broadly agreed with, the FSAP
conclusions. In particular, they have: (i) begun to implement measures to ensure compliance
with the Basel Core Principles; (ii) given priority to strengthening the regulatory framework
for NBFIs; (iii) agreed to consider bringing the specialized financial institutions under the
supervision of the BoN; (iv) supported expanding domestic investment opportunities, by
developing leasing, factoring and asset securitization; and (v) may consider abolishing or
raising the usury rate provided that the Usury Act’s role in protecting consumers is
safeguarded. The authorities indicated they may request TA to help address these
recommendations.
III. STATISTICAL ISSUES
46.
The authorities have improved coverage of the national accounts, introduced a
nationwide consumer price index, and enhanced monitoring of short-term private
sector debt. Data are generally adequate for surveillance purposes, but shortcomings have
affected analysis of cross-border capital flows. In this context, the mission welcomed the
authorities’ intention to reconcile their international investment position with that of South
Africa and with balance of payments data. It also recommended improvements in fiscal data
and the collection of statistics on the labor market, employment, and wages.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
47.
With generally prudent macroeconomic policies, Namibia has enjoyed relatively
robust growth, falling inflation, and strong external surpluses in recent years.
Nonetheless, Namibia faces a number of significant macroeconomic challenges. These
include high unemployment, widespread poverty, and high prevalence of HIV/AIDS.
48.
The authorities should be commended for engaging in a public debate on how to
tackle these challenges while reiterating their commitment to macroeconomic stability.
While the exact shape of future reforms is still emerging, the need to enhance the quality of
education will be key. Strengthening skill levels and ensuring that students’ skills meet the
needs of the labor market are the most promising avenues to induce a noticeable dent in
unemployment. In the short run, relaxing immigration restrictions would allow for an
increased supply of skilled labor. In addition, the government should carefully evaluate key

- 25 -

provisions in the new Labor Act and their Namibianization efforts, as both may impose costs
on enterprises and make labor markets less efficient.
49.
The authorities should make additional efforts to promote domestic investment,
reform public enterprises, and clarify land reform. With regard to domestic investment,
further steps are needed to develop financial markets and instruments and reduce
impediments to entrepreneurship, including access to finance. With regard to public
enterprises, the government should not subsidize insolvent or unprofitable parastatals,
especially those operating in competitive environments, but consider restructuring or
privatizing them. With regard to land reform, the current structure of land ownership in not
sustainable. However, expropriations of commercial land should be based on objective and
transparent criteria and continue to be in full accordance with the Constitution. Another
option to address the plight of the rural poor is to improve the use of communal land.
50.
Namibia has made progress toward meeting the MDGs but stronger action is
needed. The authorities are providing HIV/AIDS treatment ahead of schedule and are
encouraged to persevere in this area. The government may also want to consider new
approaches to poverty reduction, including cash grants. However, the BIG proposal could put
macroeconomic stability at risk and compromise prudent fiscal policy. Any cash grant
program should be targeted and rolled out gradually to contain costs, gain experience, and
tackle administrative obstacles.
51.
The authorities have made progress on fiscal consolidation but should do more.
Although the fiscal deficit declined in 2004/05, the scope of adjustment was disappointing as
revenue fell short of expectations and expenditures exceeded budgetary appropriations at
some ministries. Without a stronger commitment to rein in spending, the envisaged reduction
in the public debt ratio and reprioritization of spending will not be possible. The decline in
interest rates has created an opportunity to address the fiscal deficit at minimum risk to
economic growth. In addressing the deficit, the authorities should continue their efforts to
shore up revenues, particularly through improved tax administration. On the expenditure
side, restraining personnel expenditures will be key, and a comprehensive strategy to this
effect is urgently needed. This could provide the necessary room to reorient spending toward
priority sectors while also helping bring the public debt ratio on a downward path. The
targeted public debt ratio of 25 percent of GDP earlier helped to provide fiscal discipline but
now has lost some credibility. Having a target helps impose fiscal discipline but the
government should consider moving to a higher, more credible target. Overall, the authorities
are encouraged to base their medium-term expenditure framework on realistic assumptions.
52.
The appreciation of the currency since 2002 has so far had limited economic
impact, and competitiveness remains broadly adequate. Nevertheless, the authorities are
encouraged to carefully monitor competitiveness and develop more refined measures to this
end, such as unit labor costs.

- 26 -

53.
With a view to strengthening the peg to the rand, the authorities should consider
market-oriented steps to increase international reserves. While strengthening domestic
investment opportunities is most promising in this regard, the BoN should make additional
efforts to purchase foreign exchange and, if necessary, sterilize these purchases to limit
offsetting flows into the South African rand. The authorities should not rule out the
possibility of establishing a positive interest rate differential vis-à-vis South Africa,
particularly if a crisis should occur. Finally, the authorities are urged to implement the FSAP
recommendations as soon as practicable.
54.

Staff recommend that Namibia remain on the standard 12-month consultation cycle.

1/ The "overall balance" reflects externally financed project spending (except for roads) that is not channeled through the state account.
By contrast, the "overall balance excluding extrabudgetary spending" excludes such spending and thus corresponds directly with the GRN concept.

1/ External current account surplus.
2/ The alternative scenario assumes that diamond production drops by 10 percent and the authorities are not able to improve
tax administration and fail to rein in personnel expenditure, subsidies, and net lending to parastatals, which substantially
raises the public debt ratio. While the increased deficit would stimulate growth in the short-term and thus counter the impact
of the external shock, in the medium-term private sector activity would be negatively affected by crowding out of private
sector investment and an increased risk premium on interest rates.
3/ Figures are for fiscal year, which begins April 1.

Article IV Consultations
Namibia is on the standard 12-month Article IV consultation cycle; the Executive Board
concluded the last Article IV consultation on February 14, 2005.
During the Executive Board meeting, Directors commended Namibia’s record of
macroeconomic stability and welcomed the recent rise in growth, decline in inflation, and
strengthening of external accounts. Directors emphasized the need to reduce the fiscal deficit
through expenditure restraint and civil service reform. They observed that the exchange rate
peg had served Namibia well but noted the importance of maintaining adequate international
reserves. Directors also stressed the importance of addressing HIV/AIDS, high
unemployment, and large disparities of income.

APPENDIX II

Namibia: Relations with the World Bank Group
(As of end-January, 2006)
1.
Namibia joined the World Bank, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the
Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) in 1990. Currently, the Bank has no
IBRD loans to Namibia. With a GDP per capita of about US$2,000, Namibia is not eligible
for IDA assistance. The dialogue and knowledge sharing interventions in Namibia are
focused on: (i) growth and poverty reduction; (ii) HIV/AIDS; (iii) capacity building for both
public and private sectors; (iv) education; (v) support for implementing decentralization; and
(vi) support in environmental management and bio-conservation.
2.
In response to Government’s interest in Bank support, a Policy and Human Resource
Development (PHRD) grant was used to prepare programs for sub-national governments and
service delivery through fiscal decentralization. A grant from the Institutional Development
Fund (IDF) supported a public expenditure tracking survey (PETS) for the Ministries of
Basic Education and Health, and assessed their capacity to manage public spending. A senior
policy seminar in June 2005 presented recommendations and proposed an action plan.
3.
The Integrated Community-Based Ecosystem Management Project (ICEMA) is the
first Bank operation in Namibia (a grant from the Global Environment Facility (GEF)). It
aims to promote community based integrated ecosystem management through targeted
activities that improve rural livelihoods. A second GEF project - Namibian Coast
Conservation and Management (NACOMA) for US$4.9 million was approved
September 1, 2005 and will promote conservation, sustainable use and biodiversity in coastal
ecosystems.
4.
While there is no country assistance strategy (CAS) for Namibia, the Bank is working
with the Government to prepare a Country Economic Memorandum to address the issues
identified in the Government’s key policy documents and the challenges of achieving
sustainable growth and reducing poverty and inequality. Support aims to strengthen poverty
diagnosis and build macro-micro simulation models that could analyze the macroeconomic,
structural and distributional implications of alternative policies.
5.
In March 2005, an IDF grant of US$499,000 to support the Public Private Partnership
against HIV/AIDS became effective.
6.
In response to a request from the Government, the Bank carried out a detailed study
of the education sector.1 Preliminary findings suggest the need for substantial reform and will
provide the basis for a possible IBRD operation to support implementation of the education

sector strategic plan. Donors held a round table in March 2005 to discuss the
recommendations. A second partners’ round-table is scheduled for April 2006.
7.
The IFC portfolio in Namibia is US$16.2 million in 6 projects. The IFC approved
long-term financing of US$7.9 million for a fishery project (Pescanova) to enhance the
company’s ability to catch its full quota. IFC also has an equity investment of US$1.6 million
in Namibia’s first indigenous life insurance company (Namibia Life) and is currently
negotiating the sale of its stake to a local Namibian group. Aside from the IFC portfolio,
Foreign Investment Advisory Services (FIAS) is helping Namibia to improve its investment
climate.
8.

No new MIGA projects have been executed or are planned.

APPENDIX III

Namibia: Statistical Issues

1.
Notwithstanding significant efforts by the authorities to improve statistics,
surveillance is hampered by significant lags and revisions of key macroeconomic data. Some
core data for surveillance—exchange rate, international reserves, reserve money, and interest
rates—are available on a monthly basis with reasonable timeliness. Although the reliability
and coverage of these data are generally satisfactory, data on the inter-bank positions of the
monetary and financial statistics need to be improved. The core real sector data are reported
on an annual frequency only, and fiscal and labor market data suffer from long reporting
lags. As one of fifteen countries participating in the Fund’s General Data Dissemination
System (GDDS) Project for Anglophone African Countries, Namibia has undertaken to use
the GDDS as a framework for the development of national statistical systems. GDDS
metadata for Namibia were posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board on
December 19, 2002. The Anglophone Africa project (funded by the U.K. Department for
International Development (DFID)) aims to assist participating countries to implement plans
for improvement identified in the metadata, to meet GDDS recommended statistical
practices. Metadata on central government debt were updated in November 2003 and the
financial and external sectors metadata in May 2005.
Real sector
2.
The authorities revised the coverage of national accounts over the last three years, by
incorporating new mining activity and the value-added of companies operating in Export
Processing Zones (EPZs). They have also improved surveys of the textile and agricultural
industries. As a result, the authorities revised real GDP growth in 2002 upward by
4 percentage points, to 6¾ percent, while growth in 2003 remained broadly unchanged.
3.
In February 2005, the government introduced a nation-wide consumer price index to
replace the previous index that only covered the capital city of Windhoek. The new index is
available from January 2002.
4.
The authorities report only consumer prices to STA; other data published in the
International Financial Statistics (IFS) are taken from publications of the Central Statistical
Bureau.
5.
Data on the labor market, including labor force, employment, and wages are not
systematically collected, complicating the analysis of labor market developments. The
government conducted the last labor market survey in 2000.
Government finance
6.
Annual fiscal data on budgetary central government through 2003 have been reported
to STA for publication in the 2005 GFS Yearbook and in IFS. The data, reported on a cash
basis in the GFSM 2001 format, are reasonably complete, despite some gaps in details. No
data on outstanding debt are reported. AFR receives actual fiscal data several months after

- 42 -

APPENDIX III

the end of the fiscal year. No data on budget implementation during the fiscal year are
provided.
7.
Expenditure data of line ministries are not available in a timely manner after the end
of the fiscal year and are subject to frequent revisions; however, AFR received preliminary
general ledger data related to the 2004/05 fiscal year relatively quickly following the end of
the fiscal year, which were substantially revised later on. Overall, the system for providing
expenditure information needs to be strengthened, and preliminary information on cash
expenditures of ministries should be made available on a regular and timely basis. In
addition, the reconciliation of above-the-line fiscal data with financing data should be
conducted on a regular basis and more frequently.
Monetary accounts
8.
As a result of technical assistance received from STA, the Bank of Namibia
implemented a new and improved framework for compiling monetary data, consistent with
the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual. However, the Bank of Namibia is working to
reduce the inconsistencies in the inter-bank positions of the other depository corporations.
Since June 2003, Namibia has been reporting monthly monetary statistics to STA using the
standardized forms for reporting monetary statistics (SRF) on a regular and timely basis.
Publication of these data is expected in the coming months, in a supplement to the IFS that
will include monetary data reported by member countries using the SRF.
Balance of payments
9.
Since 2001, the Bank of Namibia has reported the balance of payments data on a
quarterly basis with a lag of one quarter. These data are subject to substantial revisions. The
methodology underlying the balance of payments is consistent with the fifth edition of the
IMF’s Balance of Payments Manual and is well documented. The international investment
position (IIP) data are compiled annually but dissemination is subject to significant lags. The
IIP data are not entirely consistent with the balance of payments data, particularly for
portfolio investment assets and other investment assets and liabilities. Through a series of
three missions, the Bank of Namibia has received Fund TA to improve the compilation of the
capital and financial transactions and IIP statistics. While awaiting the enhanced statistics,
AFR has relied on a partial reconciliation between the Namibia and South Africa IIP
estimates to approximate Namibia’s IIP.

Namibia’s gross external debt of all
1/ Public and publicly guaranteed debt is only available on a
maturities. About 90 percent of
fiscal year basis (FY 03/04).
Namibia’s short-term debt is with
South Africa and virtually the entire increase in 2003 stems from increased credit from South
African parent banks to their Namibian subsidiaries.
2.
Based on the DSA template, external debt is tentatively estimated at 22.6 percent of
GDP at end-2004. The slight decline in the external debt/GDP ratio relative to the previous
year mainly reflects the improvement of the current account balance in light of higher
diamond and other mineral exports and increased SACU receipts. The baseline scenario—
consistent with the medium-term macroeconomic framework (Table 5 following the main
text)—envisages a further slight decline in gross external debt to 17 percent of GDP by the
end of the decade. This decrease reflects (i) the stabilization of the external current account
surplus at above 3 percent of GDP over the medium term; and (ii) sustained foreign direct
investment inflows to fund various investment projects, in particular related to the coming on
line of new mines and the offshore Kudu gas fields. On the other hand, it is envisaged that
the net financial account outflows—which have characterized Namibia’s external
transactions over the years—will continue, but decline over time, as domestic financial
markets and investment opportunities are being developed.

1

External debt data are based on the International Investment Position (IIP). Staff have
undertaken a partial reconciliation of Namibian and South African IIP data for 2001, 2002, and 2003.
Large differences were observed in several categories, and staff encourage the authorities to discuss
these with their South African counterparts.

APPENDIX IV

3.
The simulations under the external sustainability framework indicate that Namibia’s
external debt is sustainable over the medium term and does not give rise to any immediate
concerns (Figure 1). Although the stress tests indicate a significantly higher debt
accumulation compared to the baseline, the levels appear manageable. The debt/GDP ratio
rises to 38 percent of GDP in the most extreme bound test that includes a one-time 30 percent
real depreciation in 2006. However, as a large share of Namibia’s external debt is randdenominated at present, the bound test overstates the possible impact of a depreciation under
the current exchange rate arrangement. Another stress test simulating a 15 percent drop in the
price of Namibia’s key export products in 2006 also shows sharply rising debt levels,
approaching 36 percent of GDP, illustrating Namibia’s vulnerability to developments in
world market prices.

APPENDIX V

Namibia: Fiscal Debt Sustainability
1.
Namibia’s public debt is still moderate in comparison to other sub-Saharan African
countries. Public debt rose by 4 percentage points, to 33½ percent of GDP, during the
2004/05 fiscal year. This increase was smaller than the increase of 5½ percentage points in
2003/04. Nevertheless, the public debt-to-GDP ratio is still trending upwards, and away from
25 percent of GDP, which is the target debt level under the fiscal rule chosen by the
authorities.1
2.
The first panel of Table 1 corresponds to the baseline scenario underlying the
macroeconomic framework. It assumes the central government deficit declines gradually
while the economy maintains moderate growth and inflation (see Table 5 following the main
text). Under the baseline scenario, the public debt ratio rises modestly until 2008/09 then
declines slightly to 34 percent of GDP by 2010/11. This outcome reflects the generation of
primary surpluses and real GDP growth that surpasses real interest rates in many years. As
shown in Table 1, it would be possible to run a small primary deficit while stabilizing the
public debt ratio at its 2010/11 level.
3.
Table 1 also presents two additional scenarios. The first shows the fiscal outcome if
real GDP growth, real interest rates, and the primary balance are maintained at their
historical averages. In this case, public debt would increase steadily to 42 percent of GDP by
the end of the forecasting period. The second scenario shows the outcome if the government
does not reduce the primary deficit balance below its 2005/06 level. In this case, the public
debt ratio would reach 40 percent of GDP by 2010/11.
4.
The bound tests illustrate the vulnerability of the fiscal position to exogenous shocks
(Figure 1). Even if the Namibian authorities were successful in implementing the fiscal
adjustment underlying the baseline scenario, shocks to interest rates, growth, or the exchange
rate could still occur, resulting in a higher public debt, approaching 40 percent of GDP.
5.
Table 2 presents the fiscal sustainability analysis based on the alternative
macroeconomic scenario (see Table 5 following the main text). In this scenario, the
authorities are not able to systematically improve tax administration and fail to rein in
personnel expenditure, subsidies, and net lending to parastatals. This scenario also assumes
real GDP growth is consistently lower than in the baseline case and inflation rises to 5
percent. With these assumptions, Namibia’s public debt stock could spiral out of control,
increasing to 52 percent of GDP in 2010/11. Primary deficits would increase over time and
average 3 percent of GDP during 2006/07 to 2010/11. As a result, Namibia’s vulnerability to
shocks would be magnified. As illustrated in Figure 2, public debt levels could exceed
60 percent of GDP.
1

These figures exclude publicly guaranteed debt, which accounted for another 6½ percent of GDP in
2004/05.

- 49 -

APPENDIX V

6.
The Namibian authorities are aware of the importance of keeping their public debt in
check. On the one hand, placing the public debt ratio on a more ambitious downward
trajectory–i.e., moving forcefully to the public debt target of 25 percent of GDP–might
require an unnecessarily restrictive fiscal policy in light of the relative inflexibility of the
wage bill, in the presence of pressing other expenditure needs in priority sectors and of
collection constraints on the revenue side. This may make it advisable to instead aim at a
stabilization of public debt ratios. On the other hand, a failure to contain the debt-to-GDP
ratio at current levels could quickly result in unsustainable public debt levels.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
March 24, 2006
1.
Since issuance of the staff report, additional information has become available on the
budget for 2006/07 and the authorities’ medium-term fiscal plans. The information does not
alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
On March 16, 2006, the Minister of Finance submitted the budget for 2006/07 and the
medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF) to parliament.
3.
For 2005/06, the authorities project revenue at 31 percent of GDP, consistent with the
staff report. Higher tax revenues (by ½ percent of GDP) are projected to offset lower-thanexpected non-tax collections. No revised estimates for expenditure are available. However,
assuming that budgetary appropriations are not exceeded as they were in 2004/05, the fiscal
deficit could amount to 1½ percent of GDP (including externally financed capital spending).
4.

relative to the previous MTEF. In
particular, capital spending, including for infrastructure related to the Kudu gas field, and
outlays for education and health are expected to rise. However, the budget also provides for
subsidies to the National Energy Fund and support to parastatals. In addition, old-age
pensions are to be raised from N$300 to N$370 in an effort to alleviate poverty. Some of the
envisaged spending will have a permanent effect.
5.
The authorities’ medium-term fiscal adjustment path has become less ambitious than
presented in Box 6 of the staff report and is now closer to the outlook prepared by staff. The
budget documents project the fiscal deficit for 2007/08 and 2008/09 to average 2¼ percent of
GDP and public debt to decline only gradually to 31 percent of GDP. As such, the MTEF has
become more realistic, although it still lacks specificity on policy actions that could lead to a
sustained reduction in non-priority spending, as outlined below. Subsequent to the budget
speech, the authorities indicated to staff that they remain committed to achieving the public

-2-

debt target of 25 percent of GDP in the long run but in the short run intend to place less
emphasis on this objective.
6.
The medium-term fiscal outlook is built on continued improvements in tax
administration and a limited reorientation of spending toward priority sectors. The emphasis
on improving tax administration is driven by the need to shore up revenue, as SACU receipts
are projected to normalize from 2007/08 onwards. The authorities intend to broaden their
forensic tax audits of corporations carried out by private auditors, which boosted tax
collections in 2005/06. However, a recent FAD technical assistance mission urged more
substantial reform to sustain tax collections. Among other things, this could include
rebuilding the authorities’ audit capacity and creating a large taxpayers unit. On the
expenditure side, outlays for education and health are programmed to increase noticeably.
While recognizing the need for civil service reform and the restructuring and privatization of
public enterprises, the budget documents contain little concrete measures in this direction. As
stressed in the staff appraisal, the authorities need to address both issues to make room for a
sustained reorientation of spending.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2005 Article IV Consultation with
Namibia
On March 24, 2006 the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Namibia.1
Background
Namibia recorded robust real GDP growth, falling inflation, a strong external current account
surplus, and continued low external indebtedness over the last two years. Real GDP grew by
6 percent in 2004, as new marine technologies prompted a surge in diamond production and
most other sectors of the economy showed solid economic activity, aided by a decline in
interest rates. Growth slowed in 2005, as diamond production fell relative to the high production
base of the previous year and growth rates in other sectors moderated somewhat.
The appreciation of the currency throughout much of 2004-05 hurt the fishing and commercial
agriculture industries in particular, while higher oil prices affected the transportation sector.
Inflation moderated in 2004-5, due to good rains and the strengthening Namibia dollar, which
appreciated in tandem with the South African rand to which it is pegged. Average inflation fell to
4¼ percent in 2004 and only 2¼ percent for January-November 2005.
Namibia’s external current account remained solidly in surplus, peaking at more than 10 percent
of GDP in 2004. Surging diamond exports and buoyant customs union (SACU) receipts,
which increased by one-third in 2004, more than offset a large increase in imports, including oil
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

-2imports. Outflows on the capital and financial accounts remained high as banks, pension funds,
and insurance companies invested heavily in South African financial markets. As a result,
international reserves fell to below 2 months of imports. Total external debt is estimated to have
fallen to 23 percent of GDP at end-2004.
Although improving significantly over the previous year, the fiscal deficit for 2004/05 was
4 percent of GDP, higher than expected and higher than the deficits of Namibia’s southern
African neighbors. A one-time windfall in SACU receipts and increased tax revenues from
personal income and diamonds contributed to the improvement over 2003/04. By contrast,
VAT collections were 2¼ percent of GDP lower than budgeted owing to continued
administrative problems. Similarly, the government wage bill was ½ percent of GDP higher than
budgeted as the hiring freeze was not implemented consistently across all ministries. These
developments pushed the public debt ratio to 33½ percent of GDP, well above the
government’s target of 25 percent.
Despite the overall positive macroeconomic performance, major challenges–including
widespread poverty, high unemployment, and HIV/AIDS–remain. One-fourth of the population
does not get sufficient dietary consumption, the unemployment rate exceeds 20 percent, and
the prevalence of HIV/AIDS is about 20 percent.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors commended the authorities for overall prudent macroeconomic policies, which had
contributed to the recent strong economic performance, with robust growth, declining inflation,
a large current account surplus, and continued low external and public indebtedness.
Directors considered that Namibia’s medium-term economic prospects remained promising,
provided that the authorities maintain a stable macroeconomic environment and implement,
on a timely basis, structural reforms to address key challenges. These challenges include
pervasive poverty, high unemployment, and a high prevalence of HIV/AIDS. In this context,
they welcomed the debate within Namibia aimed at deriving a structural reform agenda to deal
with these problems, raise the country’s long-term growth potential, and make progress toward
meeting the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).
Directors welcomed the reduction in the fiscal deficit since 2003/04. They commended the
authorities for their commitment to further fiscal consolidation under the 2006/07 budget and the
medium-term expenditure framework, which should help avoid a further rise in government
debt. Directors reiterated the importance of realistic budgets and the need for more sustained
efforts to shore up revenue and reprioritize spending.
On the revenue side, Directors emphasized the need to strengthen tax administration. This was
important in view of the volatility of customs union (SACU) receipts. In this light, Directors urged
the authorities to take steps to enhance their own auditing functions, with a particular focus on
large taxpayers. Making good use of technical assistance in such areas will be important.

-3Directors urged the authorities to develop a concrete strategy to allow a reorientation of
expenditure toward priority areas, such as health, education, poverty reduction, and
infrastructure. In particular, Directors stressed the need for specific measures to contain the civil
service wage bill, which is well above the levels in terms of total spending and share of GDP in
other countries in sub-Saharan Africa. They also called for progress in developing a roadmap
for restructuring and/or divesting public enterprises, as subsidies had contributed to past fiscal
deficits and diverted resources from higher return projects. Moreover, Directors encouraged the
authorities to consider new approaches to alleviate poverty, including well-targeted cash grants,
to the extent these are deemed appropriate.
Directors agreed that the peg of the Namibia dollar to the South African rand had served the
country well in light of the large trade and capital flows between the two countries. The peg has
successfully anchored macroeconomic policymaking and helped reduce inflation, with Namibia
benefiting from South Africa’s inflation-targeting framework. Although available indicators do not
suggest that the recent appreciation of the rand had negatively impacted overall exports,
economic growth, or employment, Directors urged the authorities to monitor competitiveness
closely.
Directors reiterated the importance of ensuring adequate levels of international reserves.
They considered that the creation of domestic investment opportunities would be the most
promising avenue to keep a large share of Namibia’s sizable savings at home. Directors
welcomed the elimination of the negative interest rate differential with respect to South Africa,
and most Directors urged the authorities not to rule out establishing a positive differential, if
necessary. Directors also recommended that the authorities increase international reserves
through sterilized foreign exchange purchases.
Directors welcomed Namibia’s conclusion of a review under the Financial Sector Assessment
Program (FSAP). They also welcomed the authorities’ intention to take action on the
recommendations, including upgrading the supervisory and regulatory framework and improving
access to financial services. In this regard, Directors noted the importance of addressing
regulatory gaps, especially with respect to nonbank financial institutions. They advised caution
with respect to any domestic investment requirements that could lower returns and raise risks
for pension funds and insurance companies. The authorities were encouraged to put in place an
appropriate AML/CFT framework as soon as possible.
On the structural front, Directors agreed that strengthening the quality of education would be
key to maintaining social cohesion and achieving a noticeable dent in poverty and
unemployment. They also urged the authorities to continue efforts to enhance the flexibility of
labor markets. However, Directors expressed concern regarding regulations that could increase
labor costs, such as the envisaged increase in leave days under the new Labor Act. It was
noted that unduly restricting immigration of skilled labor would be detrimental to efforts to raise
the economy’s growth potential and make Namibia a more attractive destination for investment.

-4Directors emphasized the importance of improving the business climate to promote private
sector led growth. Steps to simplify business regulations and remove other impediments to
entrepreneurship could help diversify the economy and provide jobs. Directors commended the
authorities for efforts to enhance governance through the establishment of an Anti-Corruption
Commission, which should be provided with sufficient resources to do its job. Directors also
underlined the benefits from further trade liberalization and the conclusion of the free trade
agreements with key trade partners.
Directors considered that any changes in the current structure of land ownership should be
based on objective and transparent criteria and continue to be in accordance with the
Constitution, so as to encourage investment and increase output in agriculture.
Directors observed that Namibia’s core statistics are generally adequate for surveillance
purposes, but noted that weaknesses remain in some areas. They recommended increased
efforts to collect data on the labor market, employment, and wages and to reconcile
international investment position data with the balance of payments and those of South Africa.

Statement by Peter Ngumbullu, Executive Director for Namibia
and John Steytler, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
March 24, 2006
1.
The Namibian authorities appreciate the candid exchange of views during the 2005
Article IV Consultation discussions and the FSAP mission, and have taken note of staff’s
comments and recommendations. They also find the topics for the selected papers to be well
chosen, as they supplement ongoing work by the authorities in these areas. There is a broad
measure of agreement between staff and the authorities on most aspects of economic policy.
Recent Economic Developments and Prospects
2.
Growth is expected to have slowed to 3.2 percent in 2005, following a higher growth
trend of 5.9 percent in 2004. Responsible for the moderation in growth has been diamond
production, which fell relative to the high production base of the previous year. On the
positive side, however, it should be noted that growth in 2005 had been broad-based as
reflected by robust performance of key economic sectors such as manufacturing, agriculture,
and the wholesale and retail sectors, which have been supported by a low-interest rate
environment. On average, the economy grew by 4.3 percent during 2001-2005, which is in
line with the authorities’ target set in their second National Development Plan (NDP2).
Overall the economic fundamentals of the country remain sound. Average consumer price
inflation fell to 2.3 percent in 2005, the fiscal deficit declined substantially from an all time
high of over 7 percent of GDP in 2003/04 to about 4 percent of GDP in 2004/05, allowing
the public debt to remain relatively low, the external current account remained in a healthy
surplus, and short-term interest rates have been the lowest since independence in 1990. As a
result of this excellent performance, Fitch at the end of 2005 gave Namibia an investment
grade rating of BBB- for long-term foreign currency. Going forward, the economy is
expected to grow at above 3.5 percent over the medium term, and inflation to remain at a low
single digit level.
3.
As staff note, a number of challenges and risks remain. The authorities are vigilant to
these and agree with staff on the need for cautious economic policies, to which they are fully
committed. In this connection, despite these good accomplishments, the authorities are aware
of the enormous developmental challenges facing the country going forward. In particular,
the authorities are aware that the base of the Namibian economy remains narrow with the
dependence on export of raw products continuing to persist with high rates of rural poverty
and income disparity. Efforts to diversify the economy will, therefore, be pursued with
renewed vigor in order to achieve their target of transforming Namibia into a diversified and
industrialized economy, with a high standard of living for all its citizens by 2030. In this
regard, the classification of Namibia as a middle-income country creates serious challenges
in accessing concessional funding. The authorities would like to point out that this
classification relies exclusively on income per capita, while ignoring one of the most
important yardsticks for development, namely income disparity. It cannot be right,

-2-

therefore, to give low middle income countries such as Namibia the same terms for
borrowing as are available to developed countries. The authorities hope that a
compromised set of terms and conditions for this group of countries could be reached to
help them in their endeavor to achieve the Millennium Development Goals by 2015.
Fiscal Policy
4.
The overarching objective of fiscal policy remains fiscal sustainability aimed at
keeping inflation low and to sustain the exchange rate peg. The authorities have set
themselves a number of fiscal targets that serve as a guidance for conducting fiscal policy
in a sustainable and transparent manner21. One key fiscal target is that total public debt
shall be kept below 25 percent of GDP.
5.
The authorities are aware that achieving these targets remains a difficult challenge
as expenditure pressures have been increasing amid limited resources. As a result, the
authorities were not able to meet these targets in past MTEF periods, hence staff’s concern
about the credibility of these targets, especially the one on public debt is legitimate and
shared by the authorities. Nevertheless, even though the targets remain ambitious goals,
they are good indication of the direction of fiscal policy. The authorities, therefore, remain
committed to a public debt ratio of 25 percent of GDP but realize that this will take time
and in the short run will place less emphasis on this rule. They believe that debt stock can
be contained through further alignment of revenue and expenditure over the medium term.
In this connection, the Ministry of Finance will make use of its Revenue, Expenditure and
Debt Management policies to pursue these targets and free up as much resources as
possible within the given fiscal stance.
6.
As a result of strict limits on expenditure growth, as well as a set of measures to
improve revenue collection, the last two financial years have seen a remarkable consolidation
of public finances. For instance, the budget deficit declined from a high of 7.2 percent of
GDP in fiscal year 2003/04 to 3.6 percent of GDP in 2004/05 and the debt stock stabilized22.
The financial year 2005/06 will, according to the authorities current projections, mark a
further step on the path of fiscal consolidation. Pending closure of the financial year, the
budget deficit could be as low was 1.1 percent of GDP, while a modest surplus of 0.3 percent
of GDP is envisaged for financial year 2006/07. Over the medium term the average budget
deficit is set to be within the authorities target ceiling of 3 percent of GDP.

21

To further enhance transparency of the budget, the authorities in 2004/05 adopted a programme budget, which
shows how public resources are allocated to priorities and how much expenditure impact on outcomes.
22
The authorities budget deficit figures are slightly different from those reported in the staff report. This is
because the authorities do not include financing of selected infrastructure projects through foreign loans in their
definition of the budget deficit. For transparency purposes the authorities have started to publish a full list of
projects benefiting from foreign financing together with disbursement amounts in the latest MTEF.

-3-

7.
With regard to revenue performance, total revenue increased significantly by 17
percent in 2004/05 over the out-turn of 2003/04 and is estimated to increase by 8.1 percent in
2005/06. The improvement in revenue collection was achieved without major adjustment to
tax rates, but mainly through improved revenue collection and broadening of the tax base.
Among the most effective measures in increasing domestic tax collection was the clamping
down on tax evaders through targeted forensic audits with the help of private auditing
companies. Going forward, efforts aimed at strengthening tax administration and improving
collections will continue in 2006/07. The authorities have started, with the support of Fund
technical assistance, to investigate how to improve Namibia’s tax system in 2006 and
beyond.
8.
The authorities are aware that most fiscal adjustment over the medium term would
need to come from the expenditure side, including containing the growth of the wage bill,
reduction of subsidies to parastatals and spending on goods and services. To strengthen fiscal
discipline, government has discontinued the tradition of tabling supplementary budgets. This
is a substantial improvement in the credibility and transparency of Namibia’s fiscal policy
and has improved the budget as the main fiscal policy tool. Efforts are ongoing to improve
expenditure monitoring capacity in the Ministry of Finance. In addition, the Integrated
Financial Management System (IFMS) is set to become fully operational in 2006/07 for all
transactions between the Ministry of Finance and line Ministries. The pilot phase from
November 2005 to March 2006 was, in general, a success. It is expected that the IFMS will
greatly improve the Ministry’s control over funds’ release. The Government is also
tightening the rules under which subsidies are disbursed to State Owned Enterprises and
other recipients. In future, funds will be released based on immediate need for expenditure,
rather than being disbursed purely because there was provision made in the vote of
expenditure allocation.
Monetary, Exchange Rate and Financial Sector Issues
9.
The Namibian authorities remain committed to the exchange rate peg to the South
African Rand and membership in the Common Monetary Area (CMA). The recent
appreciation of the exchange rate had put pressure on the economy to adjust, but overall the
economy remained competitive. The authorities believe that for long-term prosperity, focus
should be on improvements of total factor productivity for enhancing external
competitiveness. They recognize the need to develop additional competitiveness indicators
that will provide adequate guide to policy. The authorities believe that the current level of
reserves does not pose a risk for the exchange rate peg, as it is more than sufficient to cover
currency in circulation. This notwithstanding, they welcome the exchange of views with staff
on measures to strengthen reserves and will give careful consideration to these suggestions.
10.
The authorities are appreciative of Namibia’s Financial Sector Assessment Program
and broadly agree with its main findings and recommendations. The Financial Stability
Assessment shows Namibia’s financial system is sophisticated, diverse and highly
developed. The performance of the financial system has, however, been shaped by the

-4-

structural characteristics of the economy. In this connection, the key concern of the
government has been how to translate the high level of domestic savings into productive
investment and how to enhance access to finance. The authorities have already started to
implement some of the FSAP recommendations. For instance, they have begun to implement
measures to ensure compliance with the Basel Core Principles and a new CEO was appointed
to head NAMFISA, the body responsible for regulating non-bank financial institutions.
There is also agreement to bring specialized financial institutions under the supervision of
Bank of Namibia and to support expanding domestic investment opportunities, by
developing leasing, factoring and asset securitization. Other recommendations made by the
FSAP to further strengthen the financial system will receive the authorities attention in the
coming year. Namibia is in a very fortunate situation for a developing country to have
significant domestic savings. It is, however, uncharacteristic for a country with large
developmental needs to export some 65 percent of such savings. By and large these domestic
savings constitute contractual savings from pension funds and insurance corporations. The
authorities are committed to a reduction of capital outflow, through increased investment in
the domestic economy with the purpose of diversifying and expanding economic activities in
Namibia. In this context, the authorities will pursue a balanced approach to capital outflow
reduction that will safeguard the interest of pensioners, but will stimulate economic growth at
the same time. Their approach would also consider measures to deepen domestic financial
markets.
Structural and other Issues
11.
The authorities appreciate this year’s Article IV discussions which focused on
medium term challenges to growth. They agree with staff that additional structural reforms
would be necessary to raise Namibia’s long-term growth potential, boost investment and
address the problems of poverty, income inequality and unemployment. Key to Namibia’s
future growth strategy would be to safeguard the current macroeconomic stability,
underpinned by prudent fiscal policy and the exchange rate peg that Namibia currently
enjoys. It is for this reason that the authorities share staffs’ views about the proposed basic
income grant to alleviate poverty in Namibia. Apart from the potential macro-imbalances that
such a scheme could cause the Ministry of Finance prefers a more targeted approach to cash
grants aimed at addressing poverty. In this regard, the government already runs a number of
cash-grant schemes, including for the elderly and orphans.
12.
Also key to Namibia’s future growth path will be to further enhance and strengthen
governance and institutions necessary to support growth. In this regard, the Anti-Corruption
Commission was officially inaugurated during 2005. It is noteworthy that the Minister of
Finance in her budget tabled on March 16, 2006 made provision for the adequate resources
of the Anti-Corruption Commission to ensure that it becomes fully operational. In addition,
the State-Owned Enterprises Act was adopted in January 2006, aimed at harmonizing the
operational framework for parastatals and tightening fiscal control over them.

-5-

13.
Another key pillar of the authorities’ future growth strategy would be education
reform, which is needed to raise skill levels while reducing unemployment. In this regard the
World Bank has been assisting the Ministry of Education in developing an education sector
strategy. With regard to labor reform, the authorities would like to stress that the aim of the
recent amendments to the Labor Act was to develop measures to streamline the procedures
for dismissal, making the labor market more flexible. They note that some of the issues
raised by staff, which could make the labor market less flexible, could be reviewed. As far as
land-reform is concerned, the Namibian government reaffirms its commitment to an orderly
process in implementing its land distribution program. There is a healthy dialogue between
the authorities and all stakeholders, and government will continue to make efforts to clarify
to the public its policy on this issue.
Conclusion
14.
In conclusion, the authorities would like to affirm their strong commitment to prudent
and market oriented policies aimed at growth, employment creation and poverty reduction.
Having achieved macroeconomic stability, the authorities are aware that the challenges going
forward are immense, including the need to implement reforms at a micro level to accelerate
the country’s growth potential and reduce the high levels of unemployment and poverty. The
authorities’ task is further complicated with the high incidence of HIV/AIDS, which in
addition to the authorities’ own efforts, will require the continued assistance from the
international community to be addressed effectively. The authorities trust that the Fund will
continue to be fully responsive in providing technical assistance requested to build their
ability to strengthen the macroeconomic framework and ability to implement the reform
agenda going forward.
