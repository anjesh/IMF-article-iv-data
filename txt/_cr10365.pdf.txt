Staff Report for the 2010 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the European Department
Approved by Juha Kähkönen and Jan Kees Martijn
November 23, 2010
Executive Summary
Background and outlook: Denmark is recovering from a deep recession. A housing
market correction and domestic banking crisis exacerbated the impact of the global
financial crisis. A strong policy response helped stabilize the banking system and soften
the impact of the negative shocks. Supported by continued strong public consumption
growth and booming exports, output is projected to expand by around 2½ percent this year.
Context of past surveillance: Staff welcomed the authorities’ initial response to the dual
crisis in late 2008, and anticipated that large automatic stabilizers would be sufficient to
cushion the resulting downturn. In the end, as the contraction continued to deepen,
substantial additional fiscal stimulus was provided.
Key challenges identified during the consultation: The focus of policies needs to shift
from short-term concerns to putting growth on a steady and sustainable path while further
reducing vulnerabilities. Bringing fiscal policy gradually back to a trajectory ensuring
credibility of the peg and sustainability will be essential. Continued efforts to strengthen
financial sector regulation and supervision, including in response to supranational
initiatives, are another priority. Better allocation of resources should help address the
sluggish labor productivity growth challenge.
Authorities’ reaction: The authorities broadly agreed with the mission’s analysis of the
key policy challenges facing Denmark and its recommendations. Referring to recent
welfare and tax reforms, they were less concerned than staff about negative incentive
effects from revenue hikes in their consolidation program. There were also some
differences in emphasis among the priorities for further financial sector regulatory and
supervisory reforms.
The mission: Consultation discussions were held in Copenhagen during
October 22–November 1, 2010. The staff team—Mr. De Broeck (Head), Ms. Babihuga,
Mr. Mehrez and Mr. Ross (all EUR)—met with the Chairman of the Board of Governors
of Danmarks Nationalbank; Deputy Permanent Secretaries of the Ministry of Finance; the
Deputy Director General of the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority; and other senior
officials. The mission also met with representatives of trade unions and business
associations, and financial institutions.

I. BACKGROUND
Denmark was hard hit by dual shocks—a domestic housing correction and the global
recession
1.
Following a prolonged boom, growth started to lag in 2006 amid a slowing
housing market, rising interest rates, and binding capacity constraints (Figures 1–3).
The ensuing correction in house prices (about 20 percent) gave way to a domestic banking
crisis in mid-2008, which was compounded by rising insolvencies and unemployment as the
recession took hold. Danish banks, highly dependent on interbank funding, faced additional
pressures in the fall of 2008 as international wholesale markets froze. From peak to trough,
output contracted by close to 7 percent, as did private consumption, with exports down by
14 percent. While the duration of Denmark’s output decline was around OECD averages, its
size was significantly larger (Text figure). The labor force survey-based unemployment rate
surged by over 4 percentage points to 7.3 percent by mid-2010.

1/ As defined by Laeven and Valencia, IMF Working Paper No. 10/146.

The recession and banking crisis were mitigated by aggressive stabilization policies
2.
Swift policy actions prevented an even deeper recession and stabilized the peg.
Domestic demand and employment were buttressed by counter-cyclical fiscal policy,
automatic stabilizers, and easing monetary conditions. Part-time work schemes and expanded
active labor market policies (ALMP) helped further contain private sector employment
losses. To defend the peg, the Danish National Bank (DNB) was forced to intervene heavily
in the foreign exchange market, as well as raise policy rates, during September–
October 2008, which resulted in record high spreads in the DNB-ECB monetary policy rate.

4
When appreciation pressures reemerged, the DNB sharply lowered policy rates and
purchased some DKK 210 billion in foreign exchange from November 2008 to
December 2009 (Figure 5). Reserve build-up continued through the first half of 2010.
However, in early fall 2010, reserves started to decline, reflecting a narrowing of spreads in
the Danish-euro money market rates in tandem with continued normalization of euro area
money market conditions. To ease pressures on the peg, the DNB raised its deposit rates on
two occasions in October—the first interest rate hikes in two years.
3.
Fiscal policy delivered some 4 percentage points of GDP in discretionary
stimulus in 2009–10. Roughly two thirds of the stimulus was implemented in 2009, with
measures focused on the expenditure side—higher public consumption, subsidies and
transfer payments—but also income tax cuts in the context of a major tax reform (Text table).
Also reflecting large automatic stabilizers,1 the

45 percent in 2010, a 17 percentage points of
GDP increase since 2007. However, this has not affected investor sentiment, and spreads visà-vis German Bunds remain very low.
4.
Denmark’s flexicurity model performed well during the crisis.2 In part reflecting
flexible layoff arrangements, employment fell sharply—by 5.5 percent during 2008Q4–
2009Q4—with the construction and industry sectors particularly hard hit. Robust public
sector employment throughout the crisis helped moderate the impact of private sector losses
on total employment. Moreover, a decline in the labor force, as foreign workers left the

country, eased the impact on unemployment. Nevertheless, the number of registered
unemployed more than doubled, although from a very low pre-crisis level (Figure 4).
However, as a key test of the flexicurity model, official estimates show no indication of an
increase in the structural component. ALMP refocused on emerging new priorities (Text
table)—notably, upgrading skills in light of the changing composition of labor demand. A
large increase in government spending on unemployment benefits, in tandem with the
increase in the number of registered unemployed, and on ALMP, expenditure on which is
tied to unemployment developments, acted as an important automatic stabilizer.
Table. Overview of Crisis Measures in the Labor Market, 2009-10
February 2009

● Key changes to existing schemes: (i) increased the flexibility and administration of a training subsidy for employers if
they hire unemployed persons; and (ii) increased the duration of a scheme providing up to 6 weeks of education during
the first 9 months of unemployment

March 2009

● Introduced more flexible rules for the work-sharing scheme allowing companies to dismiss temporarily (for up to 26
weeks) employed persons with unemployment benefits

September 2009

● Introduced a package aimed at combating the increase in youth unemployment and facilitating further education
● Relaxed eligibility requirements for participating in active labour market programs—from six to three months of
unemployment

January 2010

● Established training program in vocational skills for low-skilled adult workers
● Increased funds to improve speed of assistance from employment services once workers are laid-off
● Established a national job alert system to offer support as quickly as possible
● Increased monitoring of labour market developments (e.g. vacancies)
● Tightened the rules for sickness leave (while giving sickness beneficiaries access to activation measures)
● Reorganized the Public Employment Service under a single local management serving both insured and uninsured
unemployed and benefit receivers

5.
On the financial stability front, the authorities moved aggressively to stem
pressures in the banking system through comprehensive government support. The crisis
in the domestic banking sector was closely linked to the collapse of the real estate boom, as
some banks had built up concentrated exposures in the construction and real estate sectors. In
July 2008, the central bank stepped in to provide liquidity guarantees to Roskilde bank, the
eighth largest bank, eventually nationalizing it to avoid contagion to the rest of the financial
system. Since then, a number of bank failures have followed—mostly smaller banks with
similar risk profiles. Overall, the number of commercial and savings banks has dropped from
more than 160 in mid-2006 to 125 in mid-2010, as institutions were transferred to the newly
created state holding “Financial Stability Company” for failed banks, absorbed by larger
banks, or ceased operation.
6.
The authorities’ actions and the improvement in economic conditions have
restored overall stability to the banking system. Profits have strengthened, reflecting
growing net interest income and lower write-downs, and large exposures brought down.
Aided by market normalization and official support, solvency ratios have improved and
liquidity strengthened. Nonetheless, some medium-size banks remain vulnerable, with
funding continuing in part to depend on official guarantees.

6
Recovery in the highly leveraged household and corporate sectors is slow, but exports have
rebounded
7.
Private consumption, a key driver of pre-crisis growth, has been dented by the
decline in house prices and net household wealth (Figure 2). Prone to negative consumer
sentiment and uncertainty, it is yet to regain significant momentum. Reflecting high
household gross indebtedness, the propensity to consume has been trending downwards since
mid-2008 and declined further during 2010H1, as households started to rebuild their net
financial assets position. After contracting by close to 5 percent in 2009, private consumption
rose by 1.9 percent during 2010Q1 and 0.4 percent in 2010Q2. Consumer confidence
returned to positive territory in early 2010, but has weakened again since, reaching a 4 month
low in October—in part reflecting uncertainty about current economic conditions and
expectations of higher unemployment.
8.
Consolidation is underway within the corporate sector. Like households, Danish
corporates were highly leveraged before the crisis. The sector has been hit hard by the
recession and many small and medium-sized companies have folded. Lagging the recovery,
corporate bankruptcies have continued to rise (Text figure), from already elevated levels
in 2009, and appear to be concentrated in small and medium sized companies—particularly
in the construction, trade and transport sectors, which account for about ¾ of total corporate
bankruptcies.

Exports have rebounded, led by a reversal in the services account, in particular
sea freight. After falling by 10 percent in real terms in 2009, total exports rose by 1.4 and
3 percent, during 2010Q1 and Q2, respectively.

II. OUTLOOK AND RISKS
10.
Growth is projected to reach 2.5 percent in 2010, and to decelerate to 2 percent
next year. Output began to rise again in the second half of 2009, supported by private and
public consumption, stock rebuilding, and a lagged rebound in exports—linked to strength in
German and Swedish imports. New orders have strengthened, while employment in all
industries, except construction, has begun to rebound. With the contribution of net exports
projected to turn slightly negative next year, in line with some euro area slowdown, and
public consumption growth curtailed, the expansion is expected to work its way mainly
through domestic demand. Growth is projected to hover around 2 percent during 2012–15.
With potential growth at around 1.5 percent, the output gap will be gradually closed in this
period. Inflation (year average) in 2009 was 1.3 percent, and is expected to remain at
2.0 percent in the near term (Text table).
11.
Significant and wide-ranging downside risks remain. Public consumption growth
will be capped by the fiscal consolidation package, capital formation remains weak, and
private consumption has only started to rebound—experience indicates that its recovery from
housing and banking shocks can be protracted. Danish interest rates remain unusually low,
and will most likely increase in tandem with ECB rate hikes, negatively affecting housing
and other asset prices. Highly leveraged balance sheets and variable interest rate loans leave
corporates and households vulnerable to higher interest rates, with possible knock on effects
to banks and the real economy. Proposed Basel III rules create some uncertainties as to the
operation of Denmark’s key mortgage bond market. Finally, external uncertainties continue
to be high, with euro area growth in particular subject to downside risk. The authorities
broadly agreed with staff’s risk assessment, adding a demography-driven drop in labor
supply growth as a downside risk to medium-term growth.

III. POLICIES AND DISCUSSIONS
12.
Putting growth on a steady and sustainable path while reducing vulnerabilities
will be the main challenge. As the durability of the ongoing recovery is not yet established,
withdrawal of policy support should be cautious and carefully calibrated. With remaining
vulnerabilities in the financial sector, and in view of concerns about productivity growth and
external competitiveness, strengthening the resilience of the financial sector and improving
labor productivity growth remain a priority.
A. Fiscal Policy
13.
Fiscal policy in 2009–10 has been appropriately counter-cyclical. Staff welcomed
the swift and strong fiscal response to the recession. A favorable pre-crisis fiscal position—a
combination of a budget surplus and low debt—had provided ample room for fiscal
maneuver, which was appropriately used. The authorities agreed that with growth resuming,
the focus of fiscal policy now had to shift to returning to a trajectory that ensured
sustainability while avoiding putting the recovery at risk.
14.
There was a consensus that a credible consolidation strategy to reduce the
general government deficit to below 3 percent of GDP by 2013 should anchor fiscal
policy. Staff argued that the widening of the deficit, large increase in debt, and looming

14
pressures from population ageing made consolidation imperative. Bringing down the deficit
to below the Stability and Growth Pact’s ceiling over the next three years would strike a
proper balance between support for a still fragile recovery and the need to return to a sound
underlying fiscal position. The authorities agreed that the recommended 2013 deficit target
was appropriate, and emphasized that a credible fiscal consolidation was also essential for
maintaining the credibility of the peg with the euro. In both staff’s and the authorities’ view,
further adjustment beyond 2013 would be needed to achieve headline and structural balance
in 2015—the pre-crisis medium-term target and a condition for preparing for the costs of
population ageing and ensuring fiscal sustainability.
15.
The three-year consolidation envisaged in the draft 2011 budget is overall
appropriate. Consolidation measures of some 1.5 percentage points of GDP to be
implemented during 2011–13 are equally divided between spending reductions and revenue
increases (Box 1). In the mission’s view, the consolidation package targeted the
recommended reduction in the deficit. The authorities clarified that according to their
calculations, which incorporate the delayed multi-annual effects of the large easing in 2009–
10, frontloading of the measures would not hamper the recovery: the net negative impact of
these measures on economic activity would be near zero in 2011 and gradually increase the
following two years. Staff and the authorities agreed that under these conditions some
frontloading of the measures could also help establish the package’s credibility. However, if
downside risks to the growth outlook were to materialize next year, shifting 2011 measures
to the outer years, but without changing the overall consolidation envelope, would be
appropriate.
16.
Staff would have welcomed greater emphasis on limiting public consumption
growth. Staff cautioned that the revenue measures included in the draft 2011 budget would
raise the tax burden from already very high levels, exacerbating work disincentives. The
mission also pointed to the authorities’ declared tax freeze intention. In response, Ministry of
Finance officials argued that achieving the consolidation goals solely through expenditure
cuts would have been impractical and that significant personal income tax cuts introduced by
the 2009 tax reform would broadly offset the impact of the revenue hikes. The design of the
revenue measures and a decision to reduce the duration of unemployment benefits—which
staff welcomed—would further mitigate work disincentives. Staff and the authorities agreed
that reining in spending growth was the key medium-term fiscal policy challenge as public
consumption as a share of GDP would continue to significantly exceed medium-term targets
even after the cuts.
17.
The important spending responsibilities and large autonomy of municipalities
make curtailing public consumption growth particularly challenging. Municipalities are
responsible for around 60 percent of general government employment and spending—
significantly higher than in any other EU15 country—and enjoy a large degree of spending

15
autonomy, notably in the welfare area,3 and tax autonomy. Municipalities collect less than
40 percent of general government revenue, however, and receive grants from central
government to close the substantial spending-revenue gap—they are not allowed to run
deficits. Yearly agreements between central government and municipalities determine the
size of the grants and simultaneously cap municipal spending. In spite of these agreements,
public consumption growth at the municipal level has persistently exceeded ceilings, and a
sizeable overrun is again projected in 2010 (Annex I). A new agreement between the central
government and the municipalities freezes 2011 municipal welfare spending in real terms,
and introduces additional reporting requirements—notably, preparation of half-year
accounts—and stronger collective and individual sanctions.
18.
Complying with next year’s municipal spending ceilings and meeting the
related general government deficit target will be essential. In spite of the 2010 overrun
and continued underlying strong spending pressures, representatives of the municipalities
expressed strong commitment to the new agreement, and confidence in their ability to
comply with the spending freeze. Central authorities did not expect further spending overruns
in 2011 either, given the enhanced reporting and sanctions. Staff welcomed the
improvements, but cautioned that they remained untested and that additional steps to further
strengthen the monitoring of municipal budget execution and the sanctions should be
considered. Measures could include a requirement to provide accurate and up-to-date
quarterly budget execution data, a more systematic monitoring of municipalities with a poor
budget execution record, and immediate corrective actions when spending overruns
materialize during the course of the year.
19.
Controlling public consumption growth in municipalities raises broader policy
issues. With the domestic debate focused on improvements in budget executing and
monitoring techniques, staff argued that it also should touch upon issues related to the
desired level of welfare spending and that of public consumption more generally in Denmark.
To generate a wider policy debate on these issues and give a higher profile to the yearly
central-municipal agreements, staff recommended a more systematic assessment and
discussion both before and after the budget year. The evaluation could include an analysis of
the agreements’ contribution to achieving Convergence Programme objectives. The
evaluation could be in the form of a regular report prepared by a dedicated independent fiscal
commission/institution with special expertise. The authorities agreed with the need for a
broader debate on welfare spending and were open to the idea of an independent assessment,
but argued that it could be prepared within the existing institutional framework.

3

In terms of the composition of municipal spending, welfare spending accounts for more than half of total
municipal spending in Denmark, also significantly higher than in any other EU15 country.

Box 1. Denmark: Planned Fiscal Consolidation
In May 2010, the Danish government and the main opposition party agreed on measures to
consolidate public finances during 2011–13, to bring down the deficit to below 3 percent by 2013.
Spending measures:
●

Public consumption growth capped (in real terms) in 2011–13. Relative to previous
spending plans, this entails a budget improvement of 0.6 percent of GDP.

●

Enhanced mechanisms to ensure municipal spending control. The mechanisms, taking
effect in 2011, imply that the central government grant can be reduced for the municipalities
as a whole if budgeted or actual spending grows more than agreed. Moreover, sanctions are
tightened with respect to individual municipalities that raise taxation to spend more (if and
when the municipalities as a whole exceed the agreement on municipal taxes).

●

Reorientation of spending priorities within a spending envelope of 0.6 percent of GDP.
In the municipalities, the budget for social welfare spending is kept unchanged at the 2010
budget levels in real terms. In the central government, a general savings of operating costs of
½ per cent per year in 2011–13 is envisaged.

●

Targeted central government spending cuts with savings redirected towards social
spending. These include cuts in certain cultural and educational activities; capping
development aid at 2010 nominal levels; and reducing child benefits.

●

Reform of the unemployment insurance scheme. Reduction in the duration of the benefit
from 4 to 2 years.

Revenue measures:
●

Suspension of automatic indexation of the thresholds for income taxes in 2011–13. This
measure applies to the basic income tax allowance, the income threshold for the top-bracket
personal income tax and a number of other thresholds in the tax system. The suspension is
neutral from the income distribution point of view, and will provide revenue of
approximately 0.3 percent of GDP in 2013.

●

Deferral of the planned increase in the income threshold for the top-bracket personal
income tax rate for three years. This results in gross revenue of around 0.1 percent of GDP
per year.

●

Annual ceiling of DKK 3,000 on tax deductions for trade union fees, and limitations on
tax deductions of certain employer contributions. The immediate revenue is estimated at
about 0.1 percent of GDP.

18
B. Monetary and Financial Sector Developments
20.
The authorities noted that recent monetary policy operations under the peg were
driven by euro area developments. Danish money market spreads versus the euro area had
further narrowed since July due to a rebound of area money market rates. The authorities
clarified that to ease the resulting pressure on the krone, they had intervened in the foreign
exchange market and raised deposit rates—fully in line with their stated policy to maintain a
tight peg with the euro. The authorities also noted that maintaining a tight peg in a turbulent
financial environment was complicating monetary operations and that euro adoption could be
beneficial in this respect.
21.
Fortifying financial stability and resilience while exiting from stabilization
measures enacted during the crisis will be a key challenge. Initial measures included a
blanket guarantee on claims by all depositors and senior debtors, a resolution process for
insolvent banks, and government capital injections. Additional measures and revisions—
focusing on private sector solutions—were added as developments evolved (Box 2). Coupled
with the upturn in global financial markets, these measures have had a strong positive effect
on the financial system. However, some components are scheduled to lapse as the recovery
takes hold.
22.
The overall state of the banking system has improved. Large bank (Group 1)
write-downs and impairments were sizable in 2009, with some improvement in the first half
of 2010 (Figures 7–8). Profits of large

Normalization of markets and official

confirm the adequacy of capital ratios of major banks to withstand further deterioration in the
economic environment—including European sovereign disturbances.

19
Box 2. Denmark: Financial Sector Policy Initiatives, 2009–10
Key elements of the authorities original package of financial stabilization measures (Bank Stabilization
Package I) introduced in Fall 2008 have been revised and new initiatives added as developments have
unfolded:
●

In September, 2010 the full and unlimited guarantee on individual deposits was replaced by a new
deposit insurance scheme in line with revised European Union requirements (€100,000 coverage),
covering about 45 percent of banking institutions' deposits.

●

The full guarantee on bank debt—which expired end-September 2010—has been adjusted to allow
banks to apply for individual guarantees, and extended to end-2013. The majority of banks have
joined the scheme—agreeing to restrictions in their activities (e.g., caps on remuneration; dividend
payouts) while guarantees are in effect. As of end-June 2010, guarantee commitments of DKK 364
billion had been made to 63 institutions, with 50 institutions issuing DKK 198 billion of government
backed debt.

●

The resolution company (Financial Stability Company (FSC)) has taken over eight small and
medium-size banks. As of 2010H1, FSC’s total assets amounted to DKK 46 billion (10.5 percent of
GDP; 1 percent of system assets). The FSC has received DKK 15 billion from The Private
Contingent Association (constituted by financial institutions) in fee payment for the general
government guarantee and is expecting an additional DKK 10 billion in first loss guarantee from
The Private Contingent Association. The total payment from The Private Contingent Association
will thus add up to DKK 25 billion. The FSC yielded a profit of DKK 9.5 billion in 2009, with
further profit of DKK 6 billion expected for 2010.

●

In October 2008, the authorities allowed pension funds to use a market rate rather than a market rate
plus 25 basis points when discounting their liabilities. This decreased the gap between asset and
liability rates, reducing the need to divest mortgage bond holdings—which comprise about
30 percent of the market.

●

To increase liquidity, the DNB eased collateral requirements and expanded the base through the
creation of temporary credit facilities that lasted until end-September 2010. Banks were allowed: (i)
to issue “loan bills” which could be used as collateral at the DNB; and (ii) borrow at the DNB on the
basis of their excess capital adequacy (less a 1 percent margin). The DNB also entered into currency
swap agreements with the US Federal Reserve (for $15 billion; expired February 2010) and the ECB
(€12 billion; open-ended). Other measures to increase liquidity included the postponement of VAT
and income tax payments by non-financial firms; the ability of individuals to withdraw money from
compulsory special pension saving schemes; and new export credit facilities.

●

In February 2009, a second package agreement (Bank Stabilization Package II) , aimed at enhancing
capital, passed. It allowed credit institutions to apply (until end-June 2009) for state-funded capital
injections. Forty-three credit institutions received a total of DKK 46 billion in the form of hybrid
core capital, with interest rates between approximately 9 and 11.25 percent depending on the
individual institution’s risk. The loans may be redeemed after three years.

Mortgage banks performed relatively well during the crisis. The drop in real
estate prices brought a rise in delinquencies to still very low levels (from 0.1 to 0.6 percent of
outstanding loans) and reduced profits (return on equity, on average, declined from
8.4 percent in 2007 to 1.5 percent in 2008 before recovering in 2009 to 5.2 percent).
Reflecting the government guarantees and the strength of the mortgage bond market
throughout the crisis, mortgage banks were able to borrow and raise their capital ratios, while
gradually improving their profitability.
24.

Staff and the authorities agreed that risks remain.



Bank reliance on wholesale funding rose in line with lending and leverage, increasing
vulnerability. Some medium-size banks (Group 2) have large concentrated exposures
to commercial real estate, and were hit hard as inter-bank markets froze and asset
prices faltered.



Write downs and impairments
remain elevated and exposure to
weaker parts of the economy,
particularly among smaller banks,
remains large. Large banks have
significant cross-border exposure
(Text table). Further losses may
need to be recognized near-term.
Lending growth overall is still
negative, and some small banks are
reporting losses.



Use of adjustable rate mortgages (ARMS) has grown rapidly, and now comprises
over 65 percent of the mortgage market. The practice exacerbates the macro exposure
to higher interest rates—and could hinder the rebound in consumption going forward.



Banks tightened lending standards during the crisis. However, the demand for
stronger collateral caused banks to funnel new loans through their mortgage credit
arms, resulting in a steady increase in mortgage credit. At the same time, the
household debt to disposable income ratio remains elevated, at around 300 percent,
and the high share of variable rate loans is an additional source of vulnerability.

25.
The authorities noted that, so far, phasing out the financial support has gone
smoothly. The blanket government guarantee expired end-September, 2010 without any
disruption, including in the inter-bank market. The authorities expressed confidence that
most banks will be able to replace the government’s capital injections and borrowing under
government guarantees with private sourced funding.

23
26.
The authorities expressed serious concerns with some Basel III proposals.
Proposed liquidity regulations would restrict the use of mortgage bonds in liquidity ratios.
The authorities stressed that a rapid shift from the liquid and deep mortgage bond market
toward the smaller government bond market could create some market disorder. They also
emphasized that the Danish mortgage bond market was a somewhat unique institution and
that possible new liquidity instruments would be inferior. In particular, such instruments
could introduce foreign exchange risk, or require central bank support. Staff was open to the
authorities’ concerns, but noted that a long transition period would give the Danish mortgage
bond market time to adjust, to the extent needed. To minimize any possible disruptions to
liquidity management, the authorities could start considering alternative solutions (Box 3).
27.
Pension and insurance sector outcomes have improved, but challenges remain.
The profitability of insurance companies has picked up, allowing reserves to be gradually
replenished (Text figures). Solvency ratios within the pension and insurance sector remain
sound. Moreover, the protection system implemented at the height of the financial crisis—
which forced customers to pay extra to leave the system—has lapsed, and interest rates paid
on customers savings were raised slightly in January 2010. At the same time, the provision to
apply an adjusted higher rate to discount provisions—and thus bolster insurance companies’
financial health—was extended until end-2010. Notwithstanding the recent hike, the
authorities stressed that as part of the financial stability agreement, companies agreed to be
more prudent in setting interest rates on savings.

Box 3. Denmark: How Will Basel III Liquidity Proposals Impact Danish Bond Markets?
Mortgage bonds are the predominate asset in Danish financial markets, and a key part of financial institutions’
liquidity management. The new Basel III liquidity proposals would place a lower weight on mortgage bonds
versus government paper in the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), and put greater emphasis on longer
instruments in the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) . Specifically, under current plans, mortgage bonds will be
considered a level 2 asset, with a 40 percent limit in the portfolio of liquid assets, and a 15 percent haircut. Given
that such bonds are currently assumed to be fully liquid, this change will require banks to shift out of mortgage
bonds and into government bonds. Similarly, Danish mortgage bonds with less than 1 year maturity will not be
included in the NSFR, while longer-term loans (>1 year) will need to be fully financed by stable funding. Thus
Danish ARM loans—which increasingly dominate the market—will become less attractive.
In response, the Danish authorities—as well as other Nordic officials—have noted that during the financial
crisis, mortgage bonds were as liquid as government bonds, and that they are only exposed to limited credit risk.
Loan-to-value ratios are strictly set at 80 percent, while full recourse, senior claim status, and a fast / efficient
foreclosure process are the norm. Efforts to have the proposals amended to recognize the specificity of the
Danish mortgage bond market are ongoing.
If these Basel proposals are implemented without change, what will be the impact on Danish bond markets, and
should they be mitigated? Extrapolation of a mid-2010 quantitative impact study to the full Danish banking
system indicates a liquidity shortfall of some 41 billion euros. Banks currently hold about 80 billion of the
363 billion euro mortgage bond market. About half of the banks holdings, or some 11 percent of total mortgage
bonds, will need to be shifted out of banks. Given this small proportion and a long transition period (until 2015),
the price impact on the mortgage bond market should be limited.

The impact on the government bond market, however, could be more significant given that 41 billion euros
represents 81 percent of the freely circulating government bond market. To limit price effects, the authorities
could consider alternative liquidity instruments. Regarding the NFSR, while Danish ARM loans within mortgage
bond strictures carry little risk to financial intermediaries, they can pose a macro risk. Movements in interest
rates will have a sizable impact on real estate values, and thus on the wider economy. Therefore, a new NSFR
which promotes a reduction in Danish ARM loans should be welcomed.

25
C. Financial Sector Supervision
28.
The central bank and the supervisory authorities have strengthened
collaboration and information sharing. The Financial Supervisory Authority (FSA) is
responsible for micro-supervision, while the DNB handles macro-prudential supervision. The
granting of government guarantees prompted increased interaction between FSA and DNB,
and enhanced access to bank data. To improve the DNB’s macro-prudential capabilities,
statutes have been revised to allow it to independently collect data for macro-prudential
purposes as well as micro-level bank data. In addition, the authorities conduct joint liquidity
stress tests.
29.
Cross-border supervision has been enhanced, in particular, among Nordic and
Baltic authorities. In August, Denmark joined other Nordic and Baltic countries in signing a
cooperation agreement on cross-border financial stability, crisis management, and
resolution—the first ever implementation of a EU-wide initiative. Moreover, supervisory
colleges have been extended to include all large banking groups.
30.
The authorities noted that some warranted consolidation of Group 2 (mediumsize) banks would likely occur due to the compliance costs of Basel III. They stressed the
trend decline in the number of banks over the last few decades (Text figure). The authorities
felt that banking sector restructuring would occur organically as the new Basel III regime
came into effect and would not require additional incentives.

31.
Staff and the authorities agreed that all banks should accept the new resolution
scheme. It replaces a temporary arrangement introduced in response to the 2008 banking
crisis, and is in line with best practices. However, legal constraints prohibit making it
mandatory. At their next general shareholder meetings, banks need to decide whether to be
governed by the new scheme or remain under corporate bankruptcy procedures in the event
of insolvency. The authorities thought that most banks would join the resolution scheme
voluntarily, but private market participants expressed some doubts.

26
IV. LABOR MARKET AND COMPETITIVENESS
32.
With Denmark’s flexicurity model expected to continue to perform well, the
policy focus is now shifting to looming labor supply pressures. The authorities were
confident that the jump in conjunctural unemployment would be absorbed by the recovery.
Noting that labor supply is projected to decline over the medium term due to demographic
developments, they stressed that the recent reduction in the duration of unemployment
benefits from 4 to 2 years as well as the 2009 tax reforms would increase labor supply. Staff
emphasized that the increase in the retirement age agreed in the 2006 welfare reform would
not take effect until 2019, and that more immediate measures, including steps aimed at
phasing out early retirement schemes and reforming sickness and disability leave benefits,
would be needed.
33.
Labor productivity growth in Denmark has been below the average of
comparable advanced economies (Text figure). A significant portion of the underlying
decline in labor productivity does not appear to be related to under investment, but rather it is
due to inefficient resource allocation.4 According to the authorities, the allocation of
resources between high-productivity and

recommended measures that increase the
return to education, at higher skill levels in particular, which also would help reallocate
resources to more productive areas. Staff furthermore noted that Denmark’s flexible labor
market supports productivity overall, but higher turnover could in some instances decrease
incentives to invest in firm-specific human capital, as also suggested by relatively high public
spending on job-related training (Annex II).

Exports of goods have been falling for some time, but have been offset by rising
investment and shipping service income (Figure 9). Favorable terms of trade effects have
also underpinned the positive current account. While value-based export market shares have
declined in an amount similar to other Nordic countries, Danish exports have lost ground in
key markets (e.g., Germany and the U.K.)—which may hinder technology transfer through
integrated supply chains. Moreover, the structure of exports is relatively heavily weighted
toward the production of food and beverages, while limited in the manufacture of high-tech
goods. Overall, a quarter of Danish exports are in sectors that are declining globally (Text
figure). Notably, volume growth in food and beverage sector has declined significantly of
late.

V. STAFF APPRAISAL
36.
A recovery is taking hold following a deep and long recession. The rebound in the
global economy, fiscal stimulus and monetary easing have supported output, and real GDP is
projected to grow at about 2.5 percent this year. With the contribution of net exports
projected to ease next year, in line with some euro area slowdown, and public consumption
growth curtailed, growth is projected to decelerate to 2 percent in 2011 and to hover around
that rate in the following years, gradually closing the output gap.
37.
The Danish policy response to the dual domestic banking and global financial
crisis was overall appropriate. Fiscal stimulus of almost 4 percentage points of GDP and
major monetary easing supported activity and limited employment losses. A wide range of
public interventions stabilized the financial system once global financial pressures in the fall
of 2008 exacerbated domestic banking woes. And Denmark’s flexicurity model helped avoid
an increase in structural unemployment.
38.
The peg to the euro continues to serve Denmark well. However, maintaining a
tight peg while remaining outside the euro area is complicating monetary policy operations in
the face of continued financial turbulence. Eventual euro adoption could eliminate related
costs and concerns. Given the constraints of the peg, the current and foreseen monetary
policy stance is appropriate.
39.
Policies need to focus on putting growth on a steady and sustainable path while
reducing vulnerabilities. With the recovery under way, fiscal policy should embark on a
multi-year consolidation program. The large deterioration in the fiscal position requires a
corrective response, and fiscal adjustment is the key for maintaining credibility of the
exchange rate peg. Continued efforts to bolster financial sector stability and reduce
vulnerabilities are also essential. Resources freed through reining in public consumption
growth, together with steps to boost labor supply, productivity, and overall efficiency should
spur growth.
40.
A credible adjustment strategy to reduce the general government deficit to
below 3 percent of GDP by 2013 should anchor fiscal policy. Bringing down the deficit to
below the Stability and Growth Pact’s ceiling over the next three year strikes a proper
balance between support for a still fragile recovery and the need to return to a sound
underlying fiscal position. Further adjustment beyond 2013 will be needed to achieve
structural balance in 2015—the pre-crisis target and a necessary condition for fiscal
sustainability.
41.
From this perspective, the three-year consolidation package is overall
appropriate. The package includes measures of some 1.5 percentage points of GDP that aim
to bring down the deficit to below 3 percent of GDP by 2013. The measures are somewhat

30
frontloaded, which will establish credibility but not hamper the recovery––given the delayed
multi-annual effects of the large fiscal easing in 2009–10.
42.
However, a greater emphasis on reducing public consumption growth would
have been preferable. The tax burden is already very high, raising concerns that a proposed
further increase will exacerbate negative impacts on work incentives. Moreover, public
sector consumption as a share of GDP will continue to exceed the authorities’ indicative
ceiling and additional, ageing-related, spending pressures are looming.
43.
Sustained efforts to rein in public consumption growth and meet the 2011 deficit
targets are needed. Yearly central-municipal agreements limit public consumption growth,
but have not managed to eliminate persistent overruns, including in 2010. Going beyond
some welcome reforms agreed for 2011, there is scope for further strengthening the
monitoring of municipal budget execution and related sanctions. To give a higher profile to
the agreements and generate a broader policy debate on welfare spending in Denmark, a
more systematic assessment in the form of an independently prepared regular report could be
considered.
44.
To address weaknesses revealed by the 2008 financial crisis, the authorities have
taken important and welcome steps to strengthen financial sector supervision. The FSA
has sharpened the focus on assessing the viability of institutions’ business models, and
strengthened the transparency of its supervisory activities. The FSA also expanded its
cooperation with DNB and extended its cross-border collaboration. The establishment of a
“supervisory diamond”, which examines various bank ratios against benchmark thresholds,
is especially welcomed. The recently signed Nordic cooperation agreement on cross-border
financial stability, crisis management and resolution is also an important improvement.
45.
Nevertheless, additional actions should be undertaken to further bolster
financial sector stability. Some medium-size banks remain vulnerable—with funding
continuing to depend in part on official support. The authorities’ guarantees and capital
injections provide a two–three year window in which financial institutions should rebalance
positions and revise business models. On the regulatory and supervisory side, risks related to
possibly resurfacing real estate problems or renewed international financial pressures need to
be addressed, and international initiatives require domestic follow-up. In particular:


The supervisory diamond’s usefulness as an enforcement tool could be enhanced by a
proactive response to breeches.



DNB/FSA collaboration projects on monitoring financial sector risks could be further
strengthened—notably with regard to exposures to wholesale funding; DNB/FSA
should also, in cooperation, prepare for new macro-prudential regulation and
supervision activities and requirements.

31


Concrete and precise arrangements regarding intervention modalities and burden
sharing responsibilities should be implemented within the Nordic-Baltic cooperation
agreement.

46.
It is imperative that all banks accept the new resolution scheme. Quick and
orderly resolution is essential to minimize costs and safeguard the functioning and stability of
the financial system during a period of turmoil, and the new scheme is in line with best
practices. The authorities should use moral suasion and supervisory capital charges to ensure
that all institutions opt for the scheme.
47.
With concerns about unemployment easing, labor market policies should refocus on looming labor supply pressures. Reflecting the flexibility of Denmark’s labor
market, there is no sign of an increase in structural unemployment in the wake of the crisis.
In fact, labor supply shortages could develop over the medium term due to demographic
developments. With agreed pension reforms only taking effect in 2019, more immediate
measures, including steps aimed at phasing out early retirement schemes and reforming
sickness and disability leave benefits, are needed to reduce labor force exit.
48.
Sluggish labor productivity growth presents a challenge. Resource misallocation
appears to be a contributing factor. Reforms that increase competition and accelerate firm
exit and entry, especially in services, and measures that increase the return to education, at
higher skill levels in particular, will help reallocate resources to more productive areas.
49.
It is recommended that the Article IV consultation with Denmark remain on the
24-month cycle.

ANNEX I. DENMARK: SPENDING CONTROL IN A HIGHLY DECENTRALIZED SYSTEM1
1.
Denmark has a long standing tradition of local and regional self-government,
supported by strong public consensus. The autonomy of local governments is protected in
the Danish constitution, which provides for the right of municipalities to manage their own
affairs independently and assigns Parliament the role of delegating a number of public
functions to municipalities. The main local government bodies are:


98 municipalities, which handle a wide range of functions including: (i) child care;
(ii) primary and lower-secondary education; (iii) elderly care; (iv) preventive
health care; (v) libraries, sports facilities and other cultural activities; (vi)
implementation of active labor market policies.



5 regions, each covering several municipalities, are mainly responsible for
healthcare and health insurance, but also carry out tasks related to regional
development and growth, as well as specialized educational and social institutions.



Municipalities are represented by the National Association of Municipalities
(LGDK), which advances their collective interests during annual budget
negotiations with the government, while regions are represented by the association
of regions.

2.
In this context, sub national spending in Denmark has risen rapidly and exceeds
the average level for comparator countries (Annex figure). Denmark stands out in
international comparisons—including

municipalities are forbidden from collectively
raising the average tax rate. Individual municipal increases in the tax rate must be offset by
reductions in other municipalities, negotiated within the assocation of municipalities, such
that the average tax rate remains unchanged. With increased expenditure devolution and a
cap on tax increases, central government transfers to local governments have risen in recent
years.
4.
Fiscal vertical coordination is based on an institutionalized process of voluntary
cooperation between the center and local governments. Collaboration on the budget
works through annual negotiations between the central government and local organizations,
resulting in a framework agreement for the municipalities.3 The agreements are voluntary
and contain proposals including an overall expenditure ceiling and tax level for all
municipalities, as well as guidelines regarding economic and political priorities in key areas
for the following year. The agreements have two central characteristics. First they are
collective and do not apply to individual municipalities. This generality provides some
flexibility and allows for local differences—individual municipalities can deviate from plans,
provided that the deviation is neutralized by other municipalities. Second the agreements are
voluntary, meaning that municipalities have no legal obligation to follow them. In event of
deviation by a municipality, the central government however has the option of imposing
sanctions in order to neutralize the effect of the deviation. Moreover, the association of
municipalities can exercise moral suasion over its individual members. Following the
conclusion of negotiations, local government block grants can then be determined with the
approval of parliament.
5.
Budget agreements between the central government and municipalities aim for
balanced budgets at the municipal level. An expenditure ceiling is set in nominal terms,
such that it is consistent with a general government norm on real growth in public
consumption spending. Tax revenues—income and real property (land) taxes—yield roughly
2

Following a 2007 reform, regions do not any longer have the authority to raise their own revenue. They are
now entirely funded through central government grants.

A parallel agreement is negotiated between the central government and the association of regions.

38
60 percent of total financing, while central government block grants comprise 13 percent of
total financing.
6.
But spending at the municipal level has consistently exceeded ceilings—and the
general government spending norm has been missed since 1993. The central government
has sought to rein in growth in public spending by imposing restrictions on how local
governments finance spending. Currently, the overall growth rate of expenditures at the
municipal level is governed by the combination of: (i) a tax freeze since 2003, which keeps
average tax rates constant across municipalities; (ii) an agreement between the central
government and municipalities on the collective expenditure ceiling; (iii) a prohibition, in
principle, to borrow for purposes other than investment in utility services and restrictions
limiting municipalities’ access to credit markets; and (iv) strict rules regarding
reimbursements and user charges. However, the current system has only had limited success,
judging from repeated overruns of the spending ceiling and the general government target for
real growth in public consumption. In the context of rising asset prices, municipalities have
circumvented these restrictions in recent years, funding spending overruns with non-tax
revenues such as cash reserves from the sale of assets (land).

7.
The devolution of spending has mainly occurred in socially sensitive areas of
spending. Local governments have increasingly been assigned expenditure responsibilities in
the areas of social services, welfare and health—demographically sensitive, high growth
areas of spending. This allocation of responsibilities reflects the overriding principle that
certain public services should be carried out in close proximity to the population and that
local governments are better placed to assess their needs. Denmark stands out in comparison
to both Sweden and other unitary states with its emphasis on health and social services (Text
table). Taken together, these two items account for roughly ¾ of total sub national spending
compared to just over ½ and ⅓ in Sweden and unitary states, respectively. In particular,
expenditure pressures from aging related areas have been of great concern to local
governments in Denmark.

8.
The current fiscal framework, based on cooperative voluntary agreements, has
posed a serious problem for enforcement. The collective and voluntary nature of budget
agreements between the central government and associations of local governments makes
their enforcement practically impossible. Moreover, enforcement of these agreements by the
central government would contravene the local governments’ constitutional right to
autonomy.
9.
Instead, the central government has relied on a weak system of sanctions, with
limited success. In 2003, a tax freeze was imposed, restricting the average tax rate in
municipalities to the 2001 level. This has helped slow the upward drift in tax rates across
municipalities, but has not completely eliminated it as evidenced by the increase in tax rates
from 2007–10. In 2008, parliament passed additional sanctions and incentives which were
only relevant to municipal budgets (ex ante), not accounts (ex post)—excessive revenues
from tax increases for the municipalities as a whole would be neutralized by reductions in the
in the collective municipal block grant, and roughly DKK1 billion of the block grant became
conditional on municipality budgets meeting the agreed spending levels. Following large
spending overruns in 2009 combined with the need to consolidate public finances, the central
government further raised incentives and imposed new sanctions mechanisms aimed at
ensuring that municipal accounts meet spending targets in the context of the agreement
for 2011—the conditional block grant was raised to DKK3 billion; both the budget and the
outcome (accounts) have to comply with the ceiling; and individual sanctions regarding tax
increases have been instituted4. However, these new sanctions do not become effective
until 2011 and would not have any remedial impact on municipalities’ public finances
until 2012. The agreement for 2011 also introduces additional reporting requirements—
notably, preparation of half-year municipal accounts.
4

Any individual municipality tax increase not offset by decreases in other municipalities—resulting in an
increase in the average tax rate—has to be remitted to the central government as follows: 75 percent of the
increase has to be remitted the year of the increase, followed by 50 percent the following year and 25 percent
the year after.

10.
More broadly, the institutional vertical coordination between levels of
government has been weak. The central government has clearly faced difficulties getting
the sum of the budget of the individual municipalities to abide by a centrally negotiated
target. Moreover, central government’s overall fiscal objective of targeting real consumption
spending growth has not been well translated into individual municipal fiscal plans—as
municipal agreements focus on the annual collective expenditure ceiling, which is
denominated in nominal level terms. This has reflected a clear divergence in fiscal plans and
actions between tiers of government—as municipal budgets have until 2009 consistently
diverged from agreements with the central government.
11.
Additional steps to stem the tendency for municipalities to overspend could be
considered. The improvements in the monitoring of municipal budget execution and the
sanctions introduced in the context of the central government-municipal agreement for 2011
are welcome, but will remain in part untested until 2012 and could be complemented with
other steps. Additional measures could be considered in the following areas:
Budget formulation and monitoring


Budget formulation: municipal budgets include multiyear plans beyond the current
budget year, but in practice have limited relevance in the annual budget preparation
process. More emphasis could be put on the accuracy, quality and guiding character
of multi-year plans.



Yearly negotiations: the starting point of the negotiations should be fully consistent
will the general government balance targets and the ceiling on public consumption as
a share of GDP (rather than taking last year’s budgets or outcomes as starting point).



In-year fiscal reporting: the introduction of half-yearly accounts is welcome, but
better quarterly data to analyze developing divergences between budget plans and
execution could be considered. Direct reporting of quarterly cash-based revenue and
spending data, including a consumption/investment decomposition, could facilitate
budget execution monitoring.

41
Incentives and Sanctions


Enhancing incentives to pursue efficiency in municipal service delivery through
consideration of cost savings in the allocation of central government grants.



Easing adverse incentives to overuse benefit schemes through improving the cofinancing formula for income benefit expenditure.



Establishing clearer consequences for municipalities with a track record of
overspending. The additional ex-post monitoring of the agreements between central
and local governments introduced for 2011 is welcome. However, since
municipalities typically do not change tax rates during the course of the year, ex post
monitoring on the tax side may be of limited practical consequence. Ex post
monitoring therefore should focus on the expenditure side, and could be enhanced
through a more systematic backward looking analysis of spending and liquidity
patterns. This could help identify potential “bad performers”—i.e., municipalities that
have frequently experienced spending overruns. These municipalities could then be
subject to more intensive monitoring and additional conditions, including:
a. Requirement to submit an adjustment plan to correct for past spending
overruns
b. Requirement to set aside an unallocated contingency in the budget to offset
possible spending overruns in the budget year ahead
c. An individual municipality spending ceiling in case the contingency under b.
proves to be insufficient to prevent a spending overrun ex post.
National-Local Fiscal Coordination



Ensuring consistency between the central-local agreements and the broader fiscal
objectives at the general government level. Further efforts should aim to strengthen
the negotiation framework to help municipalities better understand and internalize
how the nominal spending ceiling and the tax freeze they agree to can contribute to
the broader objectives of fiscal policy. They also should strive to better assess the
implications of decisions from the center on new local spending mandates, and
coordinate them more effectively with the municipalities.



Giving a higher profile to the central-local agreements and generating a broader
policy discussion on their content, while maintaining their non-binding legal nature.
A more systematic ex-ante and ex-post assessment, including an analysis of their
contribution from the point of view of Convergence Programme objectives, could be
introduced. This evaluation could be in the form of a regular report, to be prepared
within the existing institutional framework.

ANNEX II. WHAT IS BEHIND THE DECLINE IN DANISH TFP GROWTH?1
A. Introduction
1.
Danish productivity, measured as gross value added per hour worked, is
relatively low and has trended downward since the mid-1990s. Coupled with
developments in labor compensation, low productivity growth has led to high unit labor costs
increases and an overall concern in Denmark regarding declining external competitiveness
and weakening growth prospects (Figure 1).
2.
A frequent explanation for low Danish productivity growth is that the recent rise
in employment included workers with below average productivity, while capital stocks
have not fully adjusted to higher labor supply levels. However, after adjusting for these
factors in a growth accounting framework, most of the decline appears to be linked to a fall
in total factor productivity (TFP) growth. The OECD (2009) has noted that this is somewhat
puzzling since the basic economic framework (e.g., regulations, education, and labor market
flexibility) is considered to be sound. The Danish Economic Council (2010) also has pointed
to the decline in TFP as evidence that resources were allocated inefficiently, and that
additional competition—especially in the service sector—was needed. In particular, they find
that highly educated workers tend to be overly represented in low productive firms and in the
public sector.
3.
The purpose of this note is to empirically examine the factors that may be
leading to a decline in Danish TFP growth. TFP is a measure of the overall efficiency with
which capital and labor are utilized, and the best yardstick for understanding the evolution of
productivity. In the next section B, we use growth accounting to illustrate the size and
sectoral source of the fall in Danish TFP. In section C, we describe possible links of TFP to
economic policy variables. The panel data empirical framework is defined in Section D,
while Section E presents the results.
4.
Our empirical results, summarized below, should be considered preliminary.
Broadly, they indicate that Danish sectoral TFP growth is significantly higher when the
“technological gap” between the domestic and leading frontier economies is large. This
suggests that there are opportunities for convergence and that policies which promote transfer
of existing knowledge and technology will enhance Danish labor productivity growth.
However, our results also indicate that Danish TFP growth is not affected by technology
developments in leading frontier economies. This implies that cutting edge innovation
dynamics found in leading economies do not spillover into Denmark, and do not play a
significant role in Danish TFP growth. Regarding structural policies, our main result implies
that Danish labor market flexibility—perhaps combined with strong income and job search
1

44
support for the unemployed—could weaken incentives for investment in firm-specific human
capital through excessive job turnover.
B. Growth Accounting
5.
Growth accounting using EU-KLEMS data provides a decomposition of the
determinants of labor productivity growth into its main components—capital intensity,
labor quality and TFP growth. The decomposition indicates that over the past decade,
Danish productivity has grown modestly both in relation to past norms, and compared to
other countries (Table 1). The main factor behind slow productivity growth is much weaker
TFP growth—which has declined from 0.8 percent on average during 1981–95
to -0.7 percent in 1996–2007. The drop in TFP is larger than in the euro area (EA) average
and significantly larger than in countries who maintained healthy productivity growth (U.S.,
Germany and Finland). Moreover, TFP slowed in most sectors, with large falls in financing
and business services, construction and network industries (Table 2).
C. Linking TFP to Economic Policy Variables
6.
Institutions and policies play a key role in determining growth patterns and
relative TFP performance between countries.


As a residual measure, TFP reflects innovation and the speed at which state of the art
technologies are adopted / diffused throughout the economy, as well as the efficiency
in which factors of production are utilized. Countries near the technology frontier
grow via introduction of newer technologies, while the “followers” increase their TFP
growth by adopting better, but existing technologies available at the frontier.



Policies that favor cost efficient adoption of existing technologies help followers,
while countries at the frontier profit more from policies that promote innovation (e.g.,
R&D and higher education spending). In particular, external trade in capital goods
with industry leaders is thought to stimulate technology transfers and convergence
toward the frontier.
D. Methodology and Data

7.
The empirical framework broadly follows that found in McMorrow et al. (2010),
Inklaar et al. (2008) and others. The empirical strategy is to estimate panel regressions for
a fifteen OECD country sample at the sectoral level over the 1987–2007 period. The baseline
specification is as follows:

Simply put, the growth in industry level (j) TFP in country (i) is a function of sectoral TFP
growth at the frontier economy (F); the sectoral gap in TFP growth between the economy (i)
and the frontier (F); sector specific and time varying information on R&D expenditures and
trade (Z); country specific labor policy variables (L); and inter-action terms between the gap
and Z and L. Other control variables (e.g., real effective exchange rates, are also included).

Productivity and TFP data comes from the KLEMS database, while structural
variables such as R&D expenditures and
10
product market regulation are taken from
Labor Market Regulation, Fraser
9
Institute, 2008
the OECD. For labor market policies, we use
8
the labor market regulations indicator from
7
the Fraser Institute. The indicator represents
6
regulations pertaining to minimum wage,
5
hiring and firing, costs of employment and
4
dismissal, and centralized collective
3
bargaining systems. The index ranges from
2
0 to 10, with lower values implying anti1
competitive regulations. Overall, the Fraser
0
labor market variable suggests that Denmark
has a relatively flexible labor market system.

9.
To provide some flavor to the data, we report the sectoral evolution of the TFP
gap over time as well as developments in R&D expenditures (Figure 2). The gap between
sectoral Danish TFP and the frontier economy is growing in many sectors (e.g., food and
beverage and tobacco; electrical and optical equipment)—and the level of the gap is
relatively high in transport, chemicals, paper products and electrical equipment. However,
there have also been improvements in some sectors (e.g., chemical; wood products) over
time. Looking at R&D expenditures, the main increases have been in chemical products—
where it appears to have helped close the TFP gap—and in electrical equipment and food and
beverages—where it has not.
E. Results
10.
Table 3 presents the results of the baseline specification, without policy variables
included. The outcomes are also provided at the manufacturing and service sector level, both
for the OECD group of countries and for Denmark2. The results indicate that for OECD
countries TFP growth is significantly higher when there is stronger TFP growth at the
frontier economy (reflecting cross-border innovation and technology spillovers) and when
the gap with the frontier economy is large. This is also the case at the OECD manufacturing
level. Broadly, a 1 percent increase in TFP growth in the frontier economy results in a
0.05 percent increase in TFP growth, while a larger TFP gap one period earlier results in a
less than 0.01 percent increase in TFP growth. However, given the size of the average TFP

gap (40 percent) and the average TFP growth rate of the frontier economy (1.8 percent), the
contribution of the gap is about 3 times larger. When we look at Denmark alone, the growth
rate of TFP at the frontier is insignificant, either across all sectors or when we focus on
market services or manufacturing. In particular, the catching up effect is higher than the
OECD average, and strongly significant, especially at the manufacturing level.
11.
Table 4 presents the results of the benchmark model but with R&D expenditures
included.3 For OECD countries, lagged R&D intensity significantly adds to TFP growth—
when looking at the total economy, manufacturing or market service levels. However, for
Denmark we find no evidence that R&D intensity improves TFP growth or absorption
capacity. This result is consistent with the fact that growth at the frontier or new
technological innovations do not appear to drive Danish TFP growth.
12.
Table 5 presents the results with the labor market variables—which are
particularly interesting. As expected, the estimates indicate that more labor market
flexibility improves TFP growth with a short lag.4 However, it only works through a square
specification, leading to an inverted-U relationship. That is, too much labor market flexibility
limits TFP growth, but so does too little flexibility. Denmark appears to be slightly to the
right of the peak, so TFP growth could be higher if Danish labor markets were somewhat less
flexible.5 One reason for this intriguing result may be that greater emphasis on flexibility may
lead to higher job turnover regardless of the state of the business cycle. In Denmark, labor
turnover is relatively high, reflecting low levels of job protection and firing and hiring costs,
but also significant unemployment and retraining support. Workers thus shift positions
frequently within Denmark’s “flexicurity” labor market. However, this could imply that the
Danish framework diminishes labor search costs too much and weakens incentives in firmspecific investment in human capital.

3

Results using product market regulation were not significant and are not reported.

4

When we aggregate the data over 3 or 4-year periods, the effect of the lagged labor becomes negative. Short
term effects appear to be positive but longer term effects negative. We do not include these results since they
only work well without fixed effects, implying data over fitting given much fewer observations.
5

Given the coefficients on lagged and squared labor market regulation, the implied maximum value of the
Fraser variable is around 5.9. Values above this level start to drag down TFP growth.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2010 Article IV Consultation with
Denmark
On December 13, 2010 the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Denmark.1
Background
Denmark is recovering from a deep recession. Output contracted sharply—by about 7 percent
from peak to trough—led by a 20 percent correction in house prices which gave way to a
domestic banking crisis in mid-2008. Danish banks, highly dependent on interbank funding,
faced additional pressures in the fall of 2008 as international wholesale markets froze.
A strong and swift policy response to the global financial crisis softened its impact on the Danish
economy and stabilized the banking system. The recovery in the global economy and
normalization of financial markets have boosted exports and confidence. This, together with
fiscal stimulus and easing monetary conditions, has supported output and halted a rapid rise in
unemployment from low pre-crisis levels. Domestic demand was buttressed by large automatic
stabilizers, discretionary fiscal easing of almost 4 percentage points of GDP, and major interest
rate cuts in line with reductions in the ECB policy rate. Extended active labor market policies
helped contain employment losses, while relatively generous unemployment benefits lessened
the social impact. The banking system was fortified by a wide range of measures, including a
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

blanket government guarantee for depositors and creditors; liquidity support; capital injections;
and a temporary bank resolution scheme. In this context, output began to rise in the second half
of 2009 and staff project real GDP to grow at about 2½ percent this year and 2 percent in 2011.
Nonetheless, the crisis and policy response have weakened the fiscal position, moving it away
from the planned pre-crisis path. The general government balance swung from a surplus of
3.4 percent of GDP in 2008 to a deficit of 2¾ percent of GDP in 2009, and the deficit is
projected to further widen in 2010, to around 5 percent of GDP—around 2 percent of GDP when
excluding cyclical and temporary components. Even with a return by 2015 to the pre-crisis
targets for the budget balance, gross general government debt as a share of GDP will still be
some 30 percentages points higher that year than envisaged before the crisis. Accordingly, the
planned pre-funding of ageing-related spending pressures will only partially materialize.
Moreover, the expected tightening in monetary conditions raises vulnerabilities for households
and corporate given their highly leveraged balance sheets and the prevalence of variable
interest rate loans, with possible knock on effects to banks and the real economy.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors noted that the Danish economy had been hit hard by dual shocks—a domestic
housing market correction and the global recession. A strong policy response—led by a large
discretionary fiscal stimulus building on Denmark’s strong macroeconomic framework—has
stabilized output and the banking system, and has prevented an increase in structural
unemployment. The economy has begun to recover.
Directors broadly concurred that economic policies should be geared at managing two key risks:
a possible worsening of growth prospects; and a tightening in monetary conditions, which could
expose household and corporate vulnerabilities arising from highly leveraged balance sheets
and variable interest rate loans.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ three-year fiscal consolidation package as an important step
towards strengthening Denmark’s fiscal position and reaching structural balance in 2015.
Achieving this medium-term objective would be key to safeguard the credibility of the peg to the
euro, prepare for ageing-related pressures, and ensure fiscal sustainability. The lagged effects
of the large fiscal easing in 2009-10 would continue to support the recovery in 2011, and some
Directors saw room for slowing the pace of consolidation should recovery be at risk.
Directors considered the consolidation strategy, including its frontloaded element, to be well
designed. At the same time, they supported stronger efforts to rein in public consumption
growth in order to meet the deficit targets. While welcoming recent expenditure control reforms,
they saw scope for further strengthening public expenditure management, particularly at the
municipal level. Containing expenditure growth would also reduce the need for tax increases,
given that Denmark’s tax burden continues to be high, even after the recent tax reform.

3
Directors supported the strengthening of financial sector supervision. They commended the
establishment of benchmark thresholds for various bank ratios, the recently signed Nordic
cooperation agreement on cross-border financial stability, crisis management and resolution,
and the strengthened cooperation between the financial supervisory agency and the National
Bank with increased focus on macro-prudential risks. Directors encouraged further efforts to
address remaining vulnerabilities in some medium-size banks, and risks that could arise from a
resurgence of domestic real estate problems or international financial pressures. They also
noted the challenges arising from implementation of Basel III rules.
Directors noted that flexicurity had helped avoid an increase in structural unemployment. Given
sluggish labor productivity growth and to boost longer run growth, Directors recommended
steps to increase returns on education, in particular at higher skill levels, and to step up
competition in the services sector to help reallocate resources to more productive uses.
Directors noted that in view of looming labor supply shortages, reforms of early retirement
schemes and of sickness and disability leave benefits are also a priority.

Statement by Per Callesen, Executive Director for Denmark
and Martin Holmberg, Advisor to Executive Director
December 13, 2010
On behalf of my Danish authorities, I would like to thank the staff for candid and
constructive policy discussions in Copenhagen during the Article IV mission. My
authorities appreciate the high quality paper addressing topical issues for the Danish
economy. They broadly concur with staff's analysis and assessment and will carefully
consider the recommendations.
Financial Sector Issues
My authorities generally welcome the assessment by staff on the current state of the
banking system. Staff identifies correctly the initiatives launched to ensure financial
stability and re-capitalization of the financial sector.
In relation to the Basel III liquidity proposals and the impact on Danish covered bond
markets, staff considers that the share (11 per cent) of total mortgage bonds that will have
to be sold by banks to meet the liquidity requirements will have a limited price effect on the
mortgage bond market. Staff believes that any possible disruptions to the liquidity
management could be addressed by considering alternative liquidity instruments.
The Danish government is more concerned than staff about the effect of the new liquidity
requirements. It is reasonable to assume that the off-loading of covered bonds probably will
take place in one or two years up to 2015. In this context, it can be assumed that an 11 per
cent reduction of the entire outstanding stock of covered bonds will have an effect on the
pricings of the covered bonds in a given year, as the issued covered bonds per year (gross)
is considerably lower than the stock. Thus, an off load of 11 per cent of all outstanding
covered bonds (41 billion) will comprise around 25 per cent of the trade of covered bonds
in a given year. Furthermore, the new EU rules regulating the insurance sector, Solvency II,
will likely also have an effect on demand for covered bonds by insurance companies and
pension funds. This will most likely result in a lasting re-pricing in the market, but will in
my authorities’ opinion not introduce any added value of financial stability. This is
supported by empirical findings by Danmarks Nationalbank that Danish covered bonds
have been as liquid as Danish government bonds during periods of market stress.1
Staff’s reference to alternative liquidity instruments in relation to the problem of the
government bond market is unclear, as only government bonds, cash and central bank
deposits can form part of the level 1 buffer. It is the authorities’ assessment that the
liquidity proposals will have significant consequences for the government bond market.
Danish credit institutions will have to hold more than 90 per cent of the outstanding
government bonds. This will in practice be impossible, since only a portion of the
outstanding government bonds are traded freely. In any case, it would seriously hamper the
liquidity of the Danish government bond market. Further, this would require pension funds
and insurance companies to sell off a large proportion of their government bonds. This is
clearly not desirable from a financial stability perspective. Government bonds of other
countries could be bought, albeit this would introduce currency risk, which can be hard to

Findings”, Danmarks Nationalbank Working Paper 2010 (70).

hedge against in the FX markets as these have not proven to be robust during financial
stress. Furthermore, this could create challenges to the exchange rate peg.
These concerns regarding the new liquidity requirements are, however, acknowledged by
the IMF in the Global Financial Stability Report (October 2010), where Danish covered
bonds are highlighted as playing a significant role in financial institutions’ liquidity
management and that implementing the LCR would generate significant stresses. Further,
my authorities strongly believe that liquid private debt markets as far as possible should be
relied upon. Relying on other countries’ government bonds may create incentives where
countries with a high government debt are put in a more favorable position compared to
countries with low government debt. This does not seem in line with the G20 commitment
to reduce government debt.
In relation to ARM loans with a maturity of less than 1 year staff considers that such loans
can pose a macro risk since movements in interest rates will have a sizeable impact on real
estate values. Staff therefore welcomes the stable funding requirement which will likely
reduce such loans. The Danish government acknowledges this, but one should also
recognize the potential positive effect of ARM loans on macroeconomic stability when
periods of economic slowdown go hand in hand with decreasing interest rates.
Economic Outlook
The Danish economy is gradually recovering. GDP is up by 3.6 per cent since 2009Q2,
following the sharp decline in production and demand in the wake of the international,
financial crisis. Unemployment has risen but yet remains surprisingly low, given the
magnitude of the downturn, and total and long term unemployment is still lower than in
many other countries and in previous downturns. Central government net debt and gross
debt this year stand at respectively 23.4 per cent of GDP and 42.6 per cent GDP, which
compares quite favorably with many other countries.
The international financial crisis accelerated the ongoing correction of the Danish housing
market thus turning the soft landing, which was expected in the spring 2008 by most
observers, into a hard landing. In fact, more than ¾ of the decline in house prices since the
peak in 2007Q3 occurred in the two quarters following the financial market freeze in late
September 2008. Hence, there was only one severe shock to the Danish economy – the
freeze of international financial markets and the associated contraction of global trade,
demand and asset prices. The shock quickly spread to a vulnerable housing and commercial
real estate market, which was already in the process of adjusting, and other parts of the
Danish economy, and hence added to the problems in the banking sector, which had
gradually been evolving during the first part of 2008.
Policy reaction to the unfolding crisis was substantial, as acknowledged by IMF staff. On
top of the automatic stabilizers – among the strongest in OECD countries – substantial
discretionary fiscal easing was implemented. Public investment increased markedly in 2009
and will continue in 2010. The overall and public consumption has risen by more than
planned. At the same, time private consumption is supported by tax cuts in the beginning of
2009 and again in 2010 and the pay-out of Special Pension (SP) savings in the second half
of 2009. Along with a sharp drop in interest rates since the autumn of 2008, the fiscal
easing has been a main driver of the recovery. Lower interest rates have, in particular, led

3

to a stabilization of the housing market, as extended use of adjustable rate mortgages
generate a stronger transmission – and thus enhanced efficiency – of monetary policy. The
flipside is higher vulnerability to an eventual normalization of the monetary policy stance.
A commonly held view is that Danish households are highly indebted. My authorities point
out, however, that the net wealth position – including private pension assets and housing
equity – is quite solid in a historical context, despite the sharp drop in asset and housing
prices from 2007 until early 2009. It has improved notably this year. But we acknowledge
that parts of this wealth (housing and pensions) are less liquid, and gross financial debt has
reached a high level. This situation involves some liquidity risk in times of financial
turmoil.
With national accounts in for 2010Q3, GDP growth this year looks to be around
2 per cent, which is less than expected by staff. Public consumption was reduced in the
third quarter, and next year my authorities expect growth to become more self-sustaining
with continued growth in private consumption and rising exports, while public demand will
contribute negatively to GDP growth. A GDP growth rate of 1¾ per cent is expected.
Substantial risks to the outlook persist, primarily linked to developments in the
international economy.
Private employment has fallen markedly, and labor adjustments in firms now seem to have
come to an end. Overall, employment levels are still somewhat higher than in 2005, which
is considered a year with relatively normal cyclical conditions. This reflects that the
estimate of structural employment has increased by around 3¼ per cent since 2005, partly
as a result of higher labor participation and a reduction of structural unemployment.
Although long-term unemployment has risen due to the decline in economic activity, the
level is still low in historical and international comparison. This is partly linked to the fact
that long-term unemployment was exceptionally low when the crisis emerged. The flexible
rules for firing and hiring and the active labor market policies have contributed to high job
turnover and help unemployed find jobs.
Wage growth has come down to around 2–2½ per cent per annum, a level similar to our
trading partners, after a number of years with excess wage increases. Despite a continued
deterioration of competitiveness and loss of export market shares in recent years, the long
record of current account surpluses has been maintained and the surplus now stands at close
to 4 per cent of GDP. Consequently, the Danish foreign debt has in recent years turned into
net foreign assets, around 7 per cent of GDP in the first half of 2010.
Fiscal policy
The crisis and the expansionary fiscal policy have weakened public finances. The structural
deficit is expected to increase to 1¾ per cent of GDP in 2010 due to the fiscal policy
easing. With no new consolidation efforts, the structural deficit would increase further in
the next decades. Thus, it is paramount to tighten fiscal policy.
The fiscal consolidation agreement from May 2010 strengthens public finances through
new initiatives of DKK 24 billion (1½ per cent of GDP) towards 2013 and a further DKK 2
billion through 2015. The agreement meets the recommendation from the EU in order to

4

bring the fiscal deficit below 3 per cent of GDP by 2013 and is a significant step towards
structural balance in 2015, the medium term fiscal target of the government.
Consolidation is implemented in three ways: through lower growth in public spending than
previously planned, higher taxes, and a reform of the unemployment benefit system, which
increases both employment and growth potential through 2015. This mix reflects several
considerations, including that even further emphasis on lower public expenditures could be
considered less credible and harder to get through parliament.
Moreover, the tax measures in the agreement are structurally well chosen, since the impact
on labor supply is modest, and much lower than the employment gains due to the reform of
the unemployment benefit system. It is estimated that the measures in the agreement will
increase labor supply by some ⅓ per cent, including the impact from higher taxes.
Moreover, the negative impact on labor supply from these tax hikes only amount to 15 per
cent of the labor supply gains from the most recent – and fully financed – tax reform.
Thus, the tax reform and the fiscal consolidation agreement overall contribute to handling
the demographic changes and long term fiscal sustainability. It complements the Welfare
Agreement from 2007, which involved a 2-year rise of age thresholds for eligibility for
retirement benefits taking effect in 2019, and also that the age thresholds for retirement
benefits will increase gradually in line with higher life expectancy. Based on current
projections, the reform can be expected to add some 8-10 per cent to employment in 2040
It remains a challenge to avoid local government expenditure overruns. Growth in public
consumption has been higher than planned almost every year since 1993. However, in 2008
growth was lower than planned. That year sanctions in case of overruns were introduced in
the form of reductions in the block grant from the central government. The accounts were
in line with the agreed budget levels in 2008 hence the sanction was not enforced.
Expenditure growth must now be kept at bay in order to avoid a permanent weakening of
the public finances, and it is a key objective to contain the growth in public consumption in
the years to come. Therefore, as mentioned by staff, new initiatives are initiated in line with
the fiscal consolidation agreement to strengthen the incentives for local government to limit
the expenditures to the agreed level. The instruments are effective from 2011 and onwards.
In addition, the agreement on the fiscal bill for 2011 includes new measures. In case of
overruns in 2011, 60 per cent of the reduction is deducted individually in the block grants
to the municipalities that spend more than budgeted and the rest of the deduction is
collective.
Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
The Danish authorities share the view that the very long standing exchange rate peg has
served Denmark well. The inflation rate is low and stable and the exchange rate peg
anchors inflation expectations, thus representing a key component of the Danish stabilityoriented macroeconomic policy.
The financial crisis highlighted the challenges of being a small open economy with a
shadow currency. As noted by the IMF staff, in the fall of 2008 Danmarks Nationalbank
conducted substantial interventions in the foreign exchange market and increased policy

5

interest rates significantly in order to defend the peg. Since autumn 2008 Danmarks
Nationalbank has lowered the policy lending rate. The spread between the policy lending
rate in Denmark and the euro area is now five basis points. Furthermore, the foreign
exchange reserve has more than doubled since the end of October 2008. The experience in
the fall of 2008 showed that very large amounts may be needed if the currency is under
pressure. Hence, a substantial foreign exchange reserve is required. Overall, these events
demonstrated the stabilization policy cost for Denmark (there are also costs related to
currency exchange, smaller seignorage etc.) of being outside the euro zone, in particular in
times of financial turbulence.
In June 2009 Danmarks Nationalbank introduced an interest margin between the policy
lending rate and the interest rate on certificates. This margin gives banks and mortgagecredit institutes an incentive to settle liquidity differences among themselves in the money
market rather than resorting to central bank's facilities.
The normalization process in the euro-area money market is closely monitored. A rise in
the short-term money market interest rates in the euro area has recently led Danmarks
Nationalbank to increase the rate of interest on certificates of deposit.
Productivity
Danish productivity levels are somewhat below the average of comparable advanced
economies – and have trended downward in relative terms since the mid-1990s. Most of the
underlying decline seems to be due to inefficient resource allocation. This may reflect that
the allocation of resources between high-productivity firms and low-productivity firms
within the same industry is inefficient. Another explanation is the concentration of highly
educated workers in the public sector relative to the private sector. My authorities agree
that reforms to intensify competition and accelerate firm exit and entry, especially in
services, should help in the diffusion of knowledge and increase productivity.
Staff findings suggest that too much labor market flexibility limits productivity growth as it
reduces firms’ willingness to invest in the education of employees. Staff states that the
flexible Danish framework with high labor market turnover might diminish labor search
costs and limit investment in firm-specific human capital. This result could imply that
Danish productivity growth could be higher with somewhat less flexible labor market
policies. Our authorities recognize the theoretical mechanism between productivity growth
and firm specific investments in human capital. Our authorities are, however, more
skeptical whether a less flexible labor market could improve Danish productivity, and find
that one should be careful to draw such a far-reaching conclusion on the basis of the
empirical analysis. The virtues of low unemployment are to be preferred to possible
marginal improvement in the average productivity of a lower employment base.
Denmark is one of the countries in the OECD with the lowest structural unemployment,
reflecting that the Danish labor market is efficient and flexible. This efficiency and
flexibility comes from high labor market mobility, which increases the number of job
openings, making it easier for the unemployed to find new jobs – possibly in new lines of
business. In this sense, the flexible Danish labor market supports reallocation of productive
worker to the most efficient firms. Furthermore, other countries with very flexible labor

6

markets, e.g., the United States, are apparently not facing the same sluggish labor
productivity growth challenge.
Finally, while the low rate of productivity increases is certainly a problem to be addressed
it has in part, as regards living standards, been compensated by a positive trend in the
terms-of-trade and a substantial improvement in net foreign interest payments (due in part
to the elimination of net foreign debt), with the latter comparable to 4 per cent of GDP over
a period of 10 years.
