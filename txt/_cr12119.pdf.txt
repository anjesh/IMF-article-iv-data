STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
March 23, 2012

KEY ISSUES
Context
Jordan continues to face multiple exogenous shocks in 2011–12—high import prices for oil
and food; repeated and extensive periods of interrupted natural gas flow from Egypt due to
sabotage of energy infrastructure; a slowdown in tourism and remittance flows; heightened
domestic and regional political tensions; and rising sovereign financing costs.

Focus of the consultation and recommendations
The immediate challenge for Jordan is to reduce fiscal and external imbalances, which will
help preserve macroeconomic stability. Staff recommends:


Proceeding with near-term fiscal consolidation plans to mitigate risks related to the
high level of public debt and any possible slowdown in external flows. Implementation
of the authorities’ medium-term fiscal reform agenda will minimize vulnerabilities,
reduce distortions, and help ensure sustainable fiscal and external balances.



Maintaining a sufficiently large international reserve buffer to serve as insurance against
unexpected shocks, especially given continuing high commodity-import prices and
regional political uncertainties.



Safeguarding the exchange rate peg remains the lynchpin for the maintenance of
financial stability. Analysis of the real exchange rate indicates that the dinar remains
broadly in line with medium-term fundamentals.



Tightening monetary conditions as appropriate, to sustain the attractiveness of
Jordanian dinar-denominated assets and contain inflation expectations.



Continuing to strengthen the resilience of the financial sector, through enhancement of
the central bank’s already-strong regulation and banking supervision.



Improving the business environment for the private sector, and encouraging
accountability and good governance, which are keys to achieving more inclusive
growth and generating employment.

BACKGROUND
1.
Economic activity slowed sharply in
2010. This slowdown followed a period of
robust growth during 2000–09 (averaging
about 6½ percent) supported by a favorable
external environment. The Jordanian economy
is among the most open in the Middle East,
and remains highly dependent on commodity
imports (oil and grains), tourism receipts,
remittances, FDI flows, and external grants.
While the authorities have implemented
structural reforms to develop the private
sector, Jordan has a chronic unemployment

problem, with overall unemployment
averaging around 13 percent during 2000–11.
Unemployment is particularly high among the
young and graduates (estimated at around
31 percent at end-2011).
2.
Jordan’s social indicators compare
well among neighboring countries. Jordan’s
key social indicators are generally better than
the average of Arab states. Jordan’s ranking on
the Human Development Index has been
improving over time, and with Lebanon is
among the highest in the Mashreq region.

3.
In the wake of the Arab Spring,
Jordan has accelerated the pace of political
reforms. However, in comparison with other
MENA countries, Jordan is implementing a
more gradual process of political reforms. The
aspirations of the Jordanian people have
broadened to embrace enhanced
accountability, transparency of government,
and an increased voice in the decision-making
process. Historic revisions to the Constitution
were made in late 2011, to better balance
power between the executive, legislative, and
judicial branches of government. In 2012,
Jordan will build on these reforms by passing
legislation establishing a new Elections Law, a
Political Parties Law, an independent electoral
commission and a constitutional court, as well
as hold parliamentary and municipal elections
under the auspices of these revised
arrangements. These steps are intended to
consolidate the move towards a multi-party
political system, where future governments
are drawn from parliamentary majorities.
4.
Jordan has a continuing
commitment to sound economic policies.
Notwithstanding the series of adverse shocks
which have recently affected the economy,
Jordan has a track record of sound economic
fundamentals and prudent policies, which
have been supported by a well-developed
institutional policy framework and strong
implementation capacity. These attributes
have yielded a set of positive macroeconomic

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

outturns, including: robust real growth; a low
inflation environment, and stable exchange
rate; limited external debt and adequate
reserve buffers; an external capital account
dominated by private capital flows; fiscal
imbalances which stabilize debt at sustainable
levels; a well supervised and sound banking
system, funded mainly by local deposits;
region-leading social and development
indicators; and good quality data and
statistical practices (Box 1). The authorities
remain committed to sound policies in the
future to reduce any remaining vulnerabilities.
5.
There is broad consensus on
economic priorities. Staff’s discussions with a
range of stakeholders yielded a broadly
common view on key economic priorities, in
line with those developed by Jordan’s
Economic Dialogue Committee. These include:
ensuring that fiscal and external balances are
sustainable; maintaining the robustness of the
exchange rate peg; fighting corruption and
bolstering the transparency of public
policymaking; improving the quality of
government services, particularly in health
and education; combating poverty through
well-targeted transfers and reducing
unemployment; dampening adverse effects of
shocks to the economy arising from its heavy
dependence on imported oil and food; and
boosting industry competitiveness,
particularly in the tourism sector.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
While economic activity remains subdued, unexpected additional fiscal and external
pressures have arisen from instability in neighboring countries. Uncertainties related to
regional economic and political developments will continue to pose significant challenges
to Jordan in 2012. Moderate economic performance is expected over the medium term.

A. 2011—A Challenging Year
6.
Subdued real GDP growth is
expected in 2011. Following a downturn in
2010, real GDP is expected to rise by
2½ percent, mainly due to modest growth in
mining, finance, and government services
sectors. Regional unrest, high imported food
and fuel prices, and rising sovereign financing
costs have adversely affected the economy.
7.
Inflation fell and unemployment
edged up. Headline inflation fell to
4½ percent in 2011, due in part to the absence
(since January 2011) of pass through of
international oil prices. However, core inflation
picked up to around 4½ percent y-o-y. The
unemployment rate increased to almost
13 percent in 2011, and is expected to
continue to rise given the country’s muted
growth prospects (Table 1 and Figure 1).
8.
Fiscal policy was accommodative.
The overall fiscal deficit increased to about
6 percent of GDP in 2011, mainly due to
increased commodity subsidies and other
social spending (costing an additional
2⅓ percent of GDP) and a cyclical weakening
in domestic revenues. Budgetary grants of
$1.4 billion (5 percent of GDP) were provided
by Saudi Arabia during 2011, which helped
fund the cost of fuel subsidies. Excluding
grants, the overall fiscal balance registered a

6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

relatively high deficit of around 12 percent of
GDP (Tables 2–3, and Figure 2).1
9.
The debt-to-GDP ratio increased
considerably. In addition to central
government borrowing, increased borrowing
on behalf of Jordan’s National Electric Power
Company (to accommodate more costly
imported fuel products used during the
frequent periods of interrupted natural gas
supply from Egypt) and other own-budget
agencies increased the public debt-to-GDP
ratio to about 64½ percent at end-2011
(Box 2).
10.
The external position worsened, as a
result of a series of adverse shocks. The
external current account deficit is expected to
widen to 9½ percent of GDP in 2011, as a
robust export performance is offset by
increased energy imports and declining
remittances and tourism receipts.2
International reserves fell by 14 percent to
reach $10.7 billion (equivalent to 6⅔ months
of imports) at end-2011, as shortfalls in foreign
1

The cyclically-adjusted primary deficit (excluding
grants) fell by 4 percentage points of potential output
to below 8 percent in 2010, before rising to about
10 percent in 2011.
2

The value of energy imports increased in part due to
higher oil prices, but also because of the need to
substitute more expensive refined fuel products for
natural gas (gas flows declined dramatically due to
repeated sabotage of the Egyptian gas pipeline).

JORDAN

direct investment (FDI) flows accompanied the
deterioration in the current account (Table 4
and Figure 3).
11.
Financing needs for 2011 were met
by borrowing from the domestic banking
system and a drawdown of international
reserves. Budgetary financing needs
(excluding grants) are estimated to have
reached $2.84 billion (9.5 percent of GDP), and
external financing needs (after FDI, new
borrowing, other capital flows, and including
official transfers) reached $1.0 billion
(3.3 percent of GDP). Given large excess
liquidity in the banking system, local banks
were able to meet the growing private credit
demand, in addition to providing for most of
the fiscal financing needs. Meanwhile, external
financing needs were met by drawing down
foreign reserves (Selected Issues, Chapter 3).

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

12.
The monetary stance has been
tightened. Following the Arab Spring, there
has been a generalized increase in sovereign
risk premia in Jordan and other MENA
countries. In addition, the low nominal interest
rate environment and rising inflation
expectations have created the conditions for
negative real interest rates. The Central Bank of
Jordan (CBJ) tightened the monetary stance in
July 2011, when it raised key interest rates by
25 basis points, increasing the overnight
window rate to 2.25 percent (Tables 5–6 and
Figure 4).
13.
Credit growth is accelerating. The
slow economic rebound is engendering a
gradual rise in credit demand. Bank private
sector credit continues to rebound (growing
by 9½ percent y-o-y in December 2011).

B. Outlook and Risks—Regional Uncertainties Remain
14.
The outlook for 2012 remains
challenging. Modest economic growth,
around 2¾ percent, is expected in 2012,
supported by improved mining and financial
services activity and continued growth in Gulf
Cooperation Council countries, to which the
business cycle of Jordan is closely linked.
Average inflation is projected to pick up to
almost 6 percent in 2012, given the planned
resumption of pass through of international oil
prices to domestic markets. Despite regional
uncertainties, the current account deficit is
projected to narrow (to 8 percent of GDP) due
to a moderation of energy imports (given
fewer disruptions to gas pipeline flows) and
buoyant mining exports.

15.
The Jordanian economy continues
to face substantial downside risks. An
outturn of higher commodity-import prices
(particularly oil imports) would generate lower
economic growth and higher fiscal and
external deficits than the baseline projections.
Indeed, Jordan has already experienced a
13 percent decline in its terms of trade in 2011.

A large and prolonged increase in

Staff Assessment: Medium
Jordan remains heavily dependent on

pressures on commodity prices, but
strong growth in emerging markets,
particularly India and China, would
contribute to persistently high
commodity prices.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Staff Assessment: Medium to High
A slowdown in the Eurozone would have
some direct adverse effects on the
Jordanian economy, mainly through trade
and financial channels.

Staff Assessment: High
The projected narrowing of the external
current account deficit would be lessened
(due to the increased cost of importing
gas-substitute fuel products), and public
debt would increase (see also Box 2).
Staff Assessment: High
Increased unrest would engender a
slowdown in external inflows (particularly
remittances, tourism, and FDI). Persistent
and heightened unrest may result in
capital outflows, a slowdown in
intraregional trade, further curtailment of
natural gas imports, and reduced
economic growth.
Staff Assessment: Medium
Failure to implement near- and
medium-term fiscal consolidation would
exacerbate existing debt sustainability
concerns.

Staff Assessment: Medium
A rise in domestic commodity prices
would typically (following pass-through)
lead to an increase in headline inflation.
Such an inflation spike might affect
inflation expectations, and raise public
and private sector wage demands.
Staff Assessment: Low to Medium
There is limited exposure of Jordanian
banks to the Eurozone, and limited trade
links with Europe. Nevertheless, Jordan
may experience a slowdown on
international trade, and face increased
sovereign and corporate borrowing costs.
Jordan may also be indirectly affected by
a Eurozone slowdown through any
consequent reduction in the global
demand for energy, which would
adversely affect Jordan’s key trading
partners (particularly the GCC countries).

spillovers to Jordan—including unrest in
neighboring countries—could adversely affect
economic activity through lower tourism
receipts and FDI, and more costly access to
capital markets. In addition, a deepening of
the European crisis could indirectly affect
Jordan, mostly through its adverse impact on
regional oil exporters (a major source of
Jordanian trade, external grants, remittances,
tourism and investment flows), given Jordan’s
limited export and financial market links to

16.
The authorities agreed with staff’s
assessment of the outlook and risks. In
particular, they viewed the frequent disruption
of natural gas flows from Egypt as a serious
risk to Jordan’s macroeconomic and financial
stability. Alternative energy sources are, and
will continue to be, costly in the short term.
Alternatives to natural gas for electricity
generation (including new pipelines and
ship-based liquefied natural gas imports) can
be introduced to cushion the cost of energy
imports over the medium term.

POLICY PRIORITIES
MANAGING THE ECONOMY IN 2012
The immediate challenge for Jordan is to reduce fiscal and external imbalances, which
will help preserve macroeconomic stability. Given limited fiscal space and rising
borrowing costs, it is important for Jordan to focus on near-term fiscal consolidation
plans and have a clear medium-term strategy to further strengthen the fiscal position.
At the same time, maintaining an appropriate monetary stance is important, along with
adopting measures to promote inclusive growth and employment.

A. Maintaining Fiscal Sustainability Amidst Rising Social Spending
Despite regional political unrest, adverse commodity price shocks and the sluggish global
economic recovery, Jordan should proceed with fiscal consolidation plans to mitigate risks
related to the already-high level of public debt and any possible slowdown in external
flows.
17.
The parliamentary-approved 2012
budget envisages considerable fiscal
consolidation. Reining in the deficit is an
appropriate and necessary step, to mitigate
risks associated with Jordan’s already-high
public debt and debt servicing costs, and to
maintain fiscal sustainability. The approved
budget focuses on raising domestic revenue

(including by removing tax exemptions,
revamping property transfer fees, and higher
tax rates on luxury goods) and containing
current spending (including by freezing public
sector hiring, reductions in the operational
costs of Ministries, and reform of the present
system of universal subsidies for gasoline and
diesel). The budget also provides for the

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 9

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

implementation of targeted transfers to
alleviate higher fuel costs associated with the
phasing out of fuel subsidies. The authorities’
budget measures would lower the overall
deficit by about 1.5 percent of GDP in 2012
(see Text Table).

The staff supports the authorities’
fiscal consolidation plans. Based on the latest
developments and macroeconomic
assumptions, if the budget is fully
implemented, the 2012 overall deficit is
expected to narrow by about 1 percent of GDP
relative to the 2011 outturn, reaching
5¼ percent of GDP.3 4 This is a large
adjustment, as evidenced by measuring the
planned consolidation in structural deficit
terms. For 2012, the cyclically-adjusted primary
3

Key differences between the 2012 Budget and the
staff’s 2012 fiscal projections include: due to assumed
slower economic activity, staff is more conservative in
calculating domestic revenue; staff also estimates
higher expenditure on subsidies due to its use of a
higher oil price forecast; and staff assumes slightly
higher debt service payments.
The cost of external debt servicing (interest payments
and amortization) is projected to increase from about
1.6 percent of GDP in 2011 to 2.7 percent in 2012,
mainly due to a large one-off principal repayment.

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19.
The debt-to-GDP ratio will rise in
2012. Given the above fiscal imbalances, and
likely public borrowing for own-budget
entities, the public debt-to-GDP ratio would
rise to 65½ percent by end-2012. The staff
cautioned that failure to implement the fiscal
consolidation envisaged in the 2012 budget
would place upward pressure on inflation,
increase external imbalances, and raise
domestic borrowing costs.

deficit (excluding grants) is projected to be
reduced by 4 percentage points to reach
6½ percent of potential GDP (Box 3).

20.
The authorities are well aware of the
short term fiscal challenges. They stated that
implementing the budget is essential to rein in
the fiscal deficit, and that it is a necessary step
to mitigate risks associated with Jordan’s
already-high public debt and debt servicing
costs, given the importance of demonstrating
commitment to maintain fiscal sustainability.


The mission welcomed the authorities’
revenue-raising efforts and supports their
intentions to eliminate inefficient tax
exemptions and privileges that narrow the
tax base, as well as broadening the
coverage of the tax system (including
through revamped property taxes) to
better target wealthy taxpayers.



On the expenditure side, the authorities
concurred with staff on the need for a
freeze in the size of the civil service, which
(depending on grant flows) would create
the fiscal space for an increase in capital
spending above its historic-low levels. The
2012 budget also puts back in place the
automatic fuel pricing mechanism, which
will remove the vulnerability of the fiscal

JORDAN

accounts to future oil price movements.5 In
addition, to better protect the needy, the
budget envisages that universal
commodity subsidies (which are biased in
favor of high-income households) will be
replaced by well-targeted compensatory
transfers—these could take the form of
cash transfers to low-income households
(Selected Issues, Chapter 1). Staff also
highlighted the importance of
communicating a comprehensive strategy
to the public to bolster support for future
subsidy reforms.


Discussions also focused on the
authorities’ medium-term fiscal objectives
and possible policy measures. These
include further consolidation of
own-budget agencies (which stand at
62 agencies at end-2011), and reforms to
the electricity and water sectors (in
particular gradually raising charges to
cost-recovery levels) that would help
ensure debt sustainability.

21.
Further fiscal consolidation will be
essential over the medium term to ensure
sustainable fiscal and external balances.
The authorities have approved a three-year
fiscal reform agenda to minimize
vulnerabilities, reduce distortions, and help
ensure that the economy achieves a higher
and more inclusive growth path. In particular,
the 2012 budget envisages a medium-term

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

path of narrowing the overall deficit to about
3½ percent of GDP by 2014.
22.
Additional policy measures will
likely be necessary to successfully achieve
the medium term budget deficit targets.
In the staff’s view, at present the bulk of the
deficit-reduction effort beyond 2012 is based
on real GDP growth, which on current
assumptions will not be sufficient to attain the
medium-term budget goal until 2017. In order
to leave some cushion for possible unforeseen
demands on the budget, gearing fiscal policy
toward a more ambitious medium-term target
would be prudent. The authorities broadly
shared the staff’s assessment, but were
confident that policy measures being
considered, along with a return in investor
confidence, would contribute to a pickup in
economic activity and net revenues.
23.
Jordan has traditionally enjoyed
a stable flow of external grants. Over the
last ten years, grants have averaged around
5½ percent of GDP. In general, grants have
moved in line with oil prices and have been
largely sourced from the oil-exporting GCC
countries.

Beginning in 2005, Jordan implemented a gradual
phasing out of fuel price subsidies. By February 2008
all domestic fuel prices (excepting LPG) followed
international prices, as Jordan had adopted an
automatic fuel pricing mechanism, which instituted full
pass through. Pass through under the mechanism
ceased in January 2011, with domestic fuel prices
based on the then international price of oil of about
$100 per barrel.

24.
Financing needs for 2012 are
expected to again be met by borrowing
from domestic banks and reserve
drawdown. Assuming full implementation of
the budget, domestic banks will meet fiscal
financing needs (excluding grants), which are
expected to reach $2.86 billion (9.1 percent of
GDP). External financing needs (after FDI, new
borrowing, other capital flows, and including
official transfers), to be met by reserve
drawdown, are expected to reach $0.9 billion
(2.7 percent of GDP). Foreign reserves are
expected to decline to about 6 months of
imports at end-2012.

25.
Such a financing strategy is unlikely
to be sustainable over the medium term, in
the absence of additional external support
or an enhanced pace of fiscal consolidation.
The mission discussed the authorities’ plans to
meet their financing needs, including through
financial support from members of the
G8-Deauville Partnership, the Development
Policy Loan with the World Bank, and potential
arrangements with other IFIs and donors.

B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy: Preserving Reserves and
Containing Inflation
In light of continuing high commodity-import prices and growing regional political
uncertainties, a sufficiently large international reserve buffer is needed as insurance
against unexpected shocks. Further tightening of monetary conditions is appropriate, to
sustain the attractiveness of Jordanian dinar-denominated assets and contain inflation
expectations.
26.
Monetary and fiscal policy
coordination is essential. While the
envisaged fiscal consolidation is critical to
ensure debt sustainability and boost
confidence in the Jordanian economy, the
fiscal deficit remains sizeable in 2012, and
there is scope for an offsetting tightening of
the monetary policy stance to ensure that
inflationary pressures remain muted. In
addition, given rising sovereign risk premia in
Jordan and other Middle East countries, further
tightening of monetary conditions is
appropriate, to sustain the attractiveness of
Jordanian dinar (JD)-denominated assets and
strengthen the international reserve position.
27.
Available monetary policy tools are
limited. Given the exchange rate peg adopted

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

by the Central Bank of Jordan (CBJ) as the
economy’s nominal anchor, tightening could
be implemented by allowing dinar interest rate
differentials against the U.S. dollar to widen by:
raising the policy (overnight window) rate;
increasing reserve requirements (to reduce
excess reserves held at the overnight window);
or by resumption of the issuance of certificates
of deposit (to soak up excess banking system
liquidity).
28.
Safeguarding the exchange rate peg
remains the lynchpin for the maintenance
of financial stability. The peg of the
Jordanian dinar to the U.S. dollar has served
the country well by anchoring inflation
expectations and providing macroeconomic
stability in a challenging regional and global

JORDAN

environment. While the real effective exchange
rate has experienced a modest appreciation of
2½ percent between December 2009 and
November 2011—driven by rising inflation
differentials with trading partners—the
mission’s analysis of the real exchange rate
suggests that the dinar remains broadly
aligned with medium-term fundamentals.
The authorities concurred, and stated that the
exchange rate peg had been crucial in
maintaining confidence in the economy during
the recent turbulent period in global and
regional financial markets (Box 4). The current
account deficit in 2011 has been adversely
affected by the higher cost of fuel imports
(due to the shortfall in gas availability, high
oil-import prices, and the increased reliance on
more expensive diesel and fuel oil as a source
feed for electricity generation), and declining
tourism and remittances receipts. Over the
medium term the current account is expected
to narrow, driven by strong export growth
(underpinned by growing production capacity),
the development of alternative energy sources
for electricity generation, and a rebound in
tourism demand and remittances flows.
29.
The authorities shared the staff’s
view that the monetary policy stance

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

should be tightened. They concurred with
staff that given recent unrest in the region,
there has likely been a generalized increase in
MENA and Jordanian sovereign risk premia.
Accordingly, there is scope for a further
tightening of the monetary stance, in order to
increase the attractiveness of
dinar-denominated assets, reverse the slow
loss of international reserves, and combat
rising inflation expectations (Selected Issues,
Chapter 4). Indeed, on February 5, 2012, the
CBJ raised key interest rates by 50 basis points,
elevating the overnight window rate to
2.75 percent.
30.
High international reserves provide
important insurance against shocks. Given
growing regional political risks and Jordan’s
vulnerable fiscal and external positions, the
staff argued that Jordan should strengthen its
international reserve buffers. The staff expects
the external current account deficit to narrow
in 2012 as exports, tourism receipts, and
remittances stabilize, and this should be
supported by a gradual rebound in FDI flows.
The authorities were slightly more pessimistic
than the staff on the likely cost of fuel imports
in 2012, and consequently expected a smaller
narrowing of the current account deficit.

C. Financial Sector: Enhancing Regulation of a Robust Banking System
The authorities should continue to strengthen the resilience of the financial sector,
through enhancement of the CBJ’s already-strong regulation and banking supervision, to
help the sector weather internal and external shocks.
31.
The Jordanian banking system
remains sound. The CBJ continues to exercise
prudent regulation and supervision of the
banking system, and banks have remained
conservative in their funding practices (with

the JD loan/deposit ratio near 73 percent at
December 2011).


The banking sector’s macro-prudential
indicators remain strong—banks remain

loans and provisioning requirements over
the medium term, as Jordan’s growth path
is likely to remain below trend in the
period to 2015. The authorities stated that
they will continue to be vigilant in
monitoring bank exposures, and stand
ready to take appropriate actions in the
event of a further deterioration in loan
quality.

At end-December 2011, private sector
credit growth stood at 9.6 percent
compared with 7.2 percent in 2010.

Continued enhancement of banking
supervision will strengthen the robustness

The small and medium enterprise (SME)

THE MEDIUM-TERM OUTLOOK
Reducing Jordan’s fiscal and external vulnerabilities, improving the business environment
for the private sector, and encouraging accountability and good governance are keys to
achieving higher inclusive economic growth and generating employment.

A. Medium-Term Challenges
36.
Key medium-term policy challenges
are to reduce Jordan’s vulnerabilities by
reining in its large fiscal and current account
deficits and dependence on external grants;
and creating jobs and providing social
protection by achieving faster and more
inclusive growth. The latter will require:
maintaining a stable macroeconomic
environment; improving the business climate
and governance; reducing generalized
subsidies and building targeted transfers and

social safety nets; enhanced trade openness;
poverty reduction efforts; and accelerating
labor market reforms to reduce rigidities.
37.
Given the high debt burden and
limited fiscal space, the government should:


Improve the regulatory and administrative
environment for businesses. Private sector
enterprises face fairly uniform access to
government business services. For

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 15

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

JORDAN

example, according to firm-level data from
the World Bank Enterprise Survey, the
median firm in Jordan can obtain an
operating license in less than a week,
which compares favorably with other
MENA countries (Selected Issues, Chapter
5). Nonetheless, the authorities plan
further enhancements to the business
investment framework using the new
Investment Law (passed in June 2011). In
particular, they plan to further streamline
procedures to obtain licenses and register
businesses, through use of the Jordan
Investment Board as a one-stop-shop and
vehicle for the promotion of foreign
investment.



Limit risks of mega-projects and bolster
public-private partnership (PPP) framework.
The authorities should continue to
refrain from issuing any form of debt
guarantees for borrowing by public
agencies in connection with prospective
mega-projects (in rail transportation (the
Jordan National Railway project),
nuclear power, and water infrastructure
(Red Sea-Dead Sea project)). The mission
argued that such loan guarantees, along
with development policy loans and
concessional funding for development
projects, could instead be extended by
donors. The passage of the PPP Law in
June 2011 is an important step toward
boosting infrastructure investment
(Selected Issues, Chapter 6).



Enhancing trade openness. The authorities
have completed their National Trade
Strategy, which will guide trade initiatives
over the medium term. Jordan has
negotiated several free trade agreements
(FTA) in recent years, most recently with
Turkey in 2011, and negotiations are
continuing with Mercosur countries on a
prospective FTA. Jordan’s bid for GCC
membership also holds the potential for
further enhancing intra- and inter-regional
trade and economic integration. Going
forward, the authorities plan to implement
their National Tourism Strategy, which it is
hoped will accelerate reforms to the
training and education of potential tourism
employees, and help attract greater
foreign direct investment into the tourism
sector.



Continue to strengthen fiscal institutions.
Continued progress in public sector
structural reforms is important to enhance
the business environment and allow for

greater private sector-led growth. Public
sector financial management has been
enhanced by better cash management
practices following the introduction of the
Treasury Single Account; and the
establishment of the Government Financial
Management Information System in major
ministries (including Finance, Planning, and
the Budget Department), with plans to
extend to remaining ministries in 2012. The
mission recommended that the authorities
take further steps to improve financial
management through: further
strengthening of the three-year
medium-term framework for budget
formation and implementation; and
greater attention to internal audit and
expenditure controls through an enhanced
Audit Bureau. In addition, accelerated
progress should be made in merging and
reducing the number of own-budget
public agencies, to reduce the burden of
these agencies on the budget. The
authorities concurred with the staff on the
need to accelerate the process of reducing
the number of agencies, and pointed out
that this was likely to occur in the context
of current reforms to the civil service.


Encourage good governance. The
authorities should put in place transparent
institutions to encourage accountability
and good governance. While Jordan
outperforms its peers in MENAP on
governance measures, there is room for
improvement. The authorities noted that
they plan to further strengthen institutions
that support transparency and good
governance, including by enhancing the
Audit Bureau, the independent

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Ombudsman Bureau (established in 2009),
and the Anti-Corruption Commission
(which operates under the revised
Anti-Corruption Law of 2011) (Box 6).


Support for poverty reduction. Jordan’s
Poverty Analysis Report, issued in 2010, is
based on the Household Income and
Expenditure Survey of 2008, and indicates
that some 13⅓ percent of the population
had incomes below the poverty line. The
mission encouraged the authorities in
their endeavors to better target their
poverty-reduction and transfer initiatives,
including those provided through the
National Aid Fund (Box 7). The authorities
pointed out that they are committed to
more efficiently addressing the issue of
poverty, including by better targeting of
transfers to the needy, drafting (with the
support of donors including the World
Bank) a new Poverty Reduction Strategy
for 2012–15, and in the short-run by
implementing capacity-building activities
and establishing micro-credit facilities in
well-established “poverty pockets” of the
country.

38.
Outreach and technical assistance.
Fulfilling a previous request of the authorities,
the CBJ and IMF co-hosted a Research
Workshop at the conclusion of the mission.
IMF staff made several well-received
presentations of analytical papers on optimal
reserves, unemployment, current account
sustainability, and commodity subsidies (see
Selected Issues chapters). The staff also
conducted a training course on DSGE
modeling for members of the CBJ Research
Department, which was much appreciated by
the authorities.

B. Inclusive and Sustainable Growth to Boost Employment
39.
Jordan has in the past experienced
relatively strong growth that helped to
create employment opportunities for both
nationals and expatriates, yet the
unemployment rate has for the last few
years been fixed at about 13 percent.
Lowering the current high level of
unemployment will require enhanced
competitiveness in the economy, and adoption
of active labor market policies that seek,
through market-friendly programs such as
vocational training, job matching services, and
support for youth start-ups, to better position
Jordanians in local and international labor
markets.
40.
Jordan faces a daunting
employment challenge. To absorb the 2010
unemployed and all new entrants to the labor
force—around 60,000 new labor market
entrants are anticipated each year—would
require annual real GDP growth of around
9⅓ percent, which is about 6 percentage
points higher than current medium-term
projections (Selected Issues, Chapter 7).
41.
Unfavorable population
demographics coupled with a weaker
economic outlook will challenge the
authorities’ ability to lower rates of
unemployment. Based on past labor market
trends, annual growth of about 4½ percent
(near potential) is insufficient to absorb
anticipated new labor market entrants. Job
creation is also constrained by the tightening
fiscal situation that will limit the public sector’s
ability to absorb labor. In addition, high
remittances and education costs contribute to
voluntary unemployment in Jordan by keeping
reservation wages high.

42.
Going forward, key priorities will be
to redirect the growth strategy to place
greater emphasis on high value-added
production and services. Possible
components of a new strategy include:


Increased capital spending (within the
constraints of fiscal sustainability) could
potentially have high returns, given
Jordan’s low capital per worker level and
relatively efficient investment process. To
benefit fully from increased capital
spending, however, Jordan could look to
further improve its investment process,
specifically the final stage, involving
project evaluation and appraisal. An
improved investment process would aid in
the creation of jobs for Jordanians
(Selected Issues, Chapter 8).



Enhancing linkages with the Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC). The GCC has
been an important platform for service
sector development—for both the tourism
and financial sectors. Potential
impediments to accessing the GCC market,
including through further improvements in
customs and trade procedures and
logistics, should be examined.

Support productivity improvements in the

Broaden corporate financing sources
(beyond the anemic equity market and
bank financing)—including access to
longer-maturity financing—by looking to
develop the corporate bond market
(including sukuk corporate bonds) as
market conditions permit.
Improve the functioning of labor markets.
Reducing rigidities in labor markets, and
decreasing the regulatory and tax burden
in product and labor markets can help
create jobs and lower unemployment—
which is particularly high among youth and
highly educated. Addressing the skill
mismatch problem in the labor market,
and adopting measures that encourage
higher labor force participation by
Jordanians, can help boost employment.

registration and regulation procedures are
welcome, and will help create a more
competitive business environment,
especially for SMEs.

Jordan needs to bolster inclusive
growth. For the new growth strategy to have a
maximum impact on job creation, it needs to
be inclusive—benefiting all segments of the
population, not just a privileged few. The
government can help by creating an enabling
environment, including by providing a level
playing field for personal and business access
to public services, and a healthy business
climate.
44.
The authorities recognized the
potential pressures on the labor market, but
stressed the efforts that are underway to
enhance job creation. They argued that while
mineral exports and manufacturing are
important sources of employment, the tourism
sector held great potential as a source of
employment given rising global tourism
demand. Further development of high-value
added manufacturing and services aimed at
regional and international markets was being
nurtured, including information
communication technology, final consumer
goods production, and eco- and
family-oriented tourism. The authorities noted
that several initiatives are underway to foster
employment generation, including: enhanced
SME formation through the National SME

Program; facilitation of job creation in the
governorates through equity investment via
the Governorates’ Investment Fund; and the
new National Employment Strategy, which will

seek to expand vocational training
opportunities to better align skill sets with
emerging employment opportunities.

STAFF APPRAISAL
45.
The Jordanian economy has endured
large external and domestic shocks in
recent years. Repeated sabotage of key
energy infrastructure, a slowdown in tourism
and remittances flows, heightened regional
political tensions, rising sovereign financing
costs, and the precipitous decline in the terms
of trade in 2010–11 (due to high import prices
for oil and food), have provided a difficult
macroeconomic backdrop. Growth has slowed
significantly as a result, despite previous fiscal
and monetary easing, and investor confidence
has weakened. The immediate challenge for
Jordan is to preserve macroeconomic stability
while enhancing inclusive growth.
46.
Jordan continues to face significant
risks. In addition to the challenging global and
domestic economic environment, unrest in
neighboring countries is adding to economic
uncertainty. As one of the world’s most
energy-import-dependent countries, adverse
developments concerning either the
diminished availability of energy imports
(through further curtailment of critical gas
supplies from Egypt) or higher energy-import
prices (due to adverse shocks to global energy
supplies) would have serious repercussions for
the Jordanian economy.
47.
The near-term outlook hinges on
the restoration of strong domestic policies.
With the difficult external environment
clouding prospects, domestic policies should

20

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

aim at building confidence in the economy.
This requires above all maintaining fiscal
discipline, which will ensure that the public
debt-to-GDP ratio is placed on a downward
path. Though Jordan’s economy has
demonstrated great resilience to past crises,
now is the time to build back fiscal buffers, to
help prepare for any future adverse shocks.
48.
The staff supports the fiscal
consolidation contained in the 2012
Budget, which will kick-start the process of
rebalancing the fiscal accounts. There is little
scope for further countercyclical fiscal policy.
Staff believes the decline in the overall deficit
of about 1 percentage point of GDP this year
is appropriate and achievable. Such
consolidation allows for better-targeted
social expenditures and transfers, and provides
the fiscal room for needed capital
expenditures. Implementation of these fiscal
plans, along with borrowing to cover the
cost of sabotage-induced additional fuel
products, would engender a small rise in
the debt-to-GDP ratio in 2012 (to about
65½ percent of GDP).
49.
The authorities have approved a
three-year fiscal reform agenda designed to
reduce vulnerabilities. While there remains
scope for further medium-term reforms, it is
important to have a clear, comprehensive
strategy to restore fiscal balance, which will
help build consensus behind the reforms,

JORDAN

maintain investor confidence, and preserve
macroeconomic stability. This strategy will
involve a combination of tax reforms, further
subsidy reforms, continued moderation of
growth in the public sector wage bill, greater
prioritization of capital spending, and
improvements in tax administration and public
sector financial management.
50.
Monetary policy should aim at
containing inflationary pressures and
support the objective of maintaining an
adequate level of reserves. With rising
regional and emerging market sovereign risk
premia, a tightening of monetary conditions is
appropriate to sustain the attractiveness of
Jordanian dinar-denominated assets and
contain inflation expectations. Given growing
regional political risks and its vulnerable fiscal
and external positions, Jordan should maintain
its large stock of international reserves cover
as insurance against risks. Notwithstanding the
recent increase in key interest rates, the staff
recommends that the monetary authorities
continue to stand ready to tighten monetary
conditions to achieve these goals.
51.
The currency peg remains the
keystone of financial stability. The dinar’s
peg to the U.S. dollar continues to serve
Jordan well by helping anchor inflation
expectations. Analysis by the staff of the level
of the real effective exchange rate indicates
that the dinar remains broadly in line with its
medium-term fundamentals.
52.
Bank regulation and supervision
should continue to focus on strengthening
the resilience of the financial sector.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

The Jordanian banking system is conservatively
managed and effectively supervised, which has
yielded a strong set of macroprudential
indicators, and has proven resilient to large
domestic and external shocks. The monetary
authorities are to be commended for their
efforts in implementing Basel II regulations,
and Jordanian banks are already well on the
way to satisfying major components of Basel III
regarding capital adequacy and liquidity.
However, in light of recent rising private sector
credit growth and continued slow economic
growth, non-performing loans and loan
provisioning should continue to be closely
monitored. The staff welcomes further
enhancements to Jordan’s already-strong
AML/CFT framework, which will provide
reassurance as to the health and integrity of
the banking sector.
53.
Jordan needs higher and more
inclusive growth. Reducing the country’s high
levels of unemployment requires a more
dynamic economy that can generate jobs.
Tackling infrastructure bottlenecks through
investment and structural reforms, and
undertaking improvements to the business
climate and efficiency of labor markets
(including reducing labor market rigidities and
enhanced vocational training to reduce skill
mismatches), would help remove key
impediments to growth and employment.
54.
It is proposed that the next
Article IV consultation be held on the
standard 12-month cycle.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 21

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

JORDAN

Box 1. Policies Since the 2010 Article IV Consultation
Macroeconomic policy implementation was broadly in line with staff recommendations in 2010.
The authorities reduced the 2010 primary fiscal deficit (excluding grants) by close to 3 percentage
points of GDP, which surpassed staff’s recommended target by almost ½ of one percent of GDP. This
was achieved mainly by lower than expected current and capital spending, despite a decline in tax
revenue (following implementation of legislation lowering the average tax burden).
Policy implementation in 2011 was mixed. External shocks affected Jordan’s economic performance,
which changed significantly the context for staff advice. The broad trend of fiscal consolidation was
reversed in 2011, due to heightened political tensions and increased social spending in response to the
multiple shocks affecting the economy. Despite higher than expected grants, the overall fiscal deficit
widened to around 6 percent of GDP, and the debt-to-GDP ratio increased to 65 percent by end-2011.
Monetary policies have been appropriately tightened and banking supervision enhanced. The
monetary authorities raised key interest rates in July 2011 and again in February 2012. This was
consistent with staff’s recommendation to continue to stand ready to tighten monetary conditions if
there are signs of pressure on the balance of payments or inflation. The monetary authorities also
continued to enhance their supervision and regulation of the Jordanian banking system, in line with
staff recommendations in the 2008 FSAP Update, particularly in their implementation of Basel II and
ensuring the readiness of banks for Basel III.
Progress on structural reforms was uneven. Passage of the Public-Private Partnership Law in
June 2011 will help boost infrastructure investment and contain risks associated with the financing of
potential mega-projects. Reforms to public financial management are moving forward, while the
consolidation of own-budget agencies is proceeding slowly. While further progress is needed with
reforms to improve the business environment for the private sector, the authorities did pass the Credit
Information and Investment Laws, which will help bolster private credit flows and investment.

Box 2. Jordan: Macroeconomic Implications of Disruptions to the Arab Gas Pipeline
Saboteurs on February 5th 2012 blew up the Arab Gas Pipeline, which supplies Egyptian natural gas to
Jordan. The pipeline, which carries gas through the Sinai Peninsula and on to Jordan and Israel, has been
attacked 13 times since February 2011. Security in the Peninsula has been deficient since the regime change
in Egypt.
Jordan has a regulated market for electricity. The National Electric Power Company (NEPCO) purchases
electricity from privately-owned generating companies at market prices, and then sells that electricity to
distribution companies at regulated tariffs. The power-generating companies rely on natural gas as the main
source of fuel for production.
The disruption in gas supplies has significant adverse macroeconomic implications for Jordan. Prior to
the repeated sabotage of the pipeline, Jordan imported about 80 percent of its gas needs (about 250 million
cubic feet of gas per day) from Egypt to generate electricity, with the remainder produced locally. When
supplies of natural gas are interrupted, power plants have to use heavy fuel oil and diesel for electricity
generation, which are about four times more costly than natural gas. This not only has implications for the
balance of payments, but it also affects the public debt position, since the government has both issued
Treasury bonds on behalf of NEPCO, and guaranteed NEPCO’s own borrowings from domestic banks.


Balance of payments impact: The more costly substitution of Egyptian natural gas supplies by fuel oil
and diesel, coupled with the 32 percent rise in global fuel prices, has increased Jordan’s energy import
bill by over 50 percent in 2011—reaching 16 percent of 2011 GDP.



Debt impact: The cost of electricity generation is estimated to have increased sharply during 2011 to
about 197 fils per kilowatt hour—nearly three times the wholesale rate at which electricity is sold to
distribution companies. As electricity tariffs remained fixed during 2011, the differential between
NEPCO’s cost-recovery price and fuel costs resulted in a large increase in NEPCO’s losses and debt. It is
estimated that domestic borrowings by or on behalf of NEPCO amounted to US$1.1 billion (about
3.8 percent of GDP) in 2011. Of this, about US$0.7 billion (2.4 percent of GDP) has involved (mainly)
borrowing by the government on behalf of NEPCO, and (partly) government guarantees of NEPCO’s
borrowings, through both channels increasing public debt.

The disruptions have also increased the urgency for Jordan to diversify its sources of energy and a
range of options are currently under consideration. Jordan is in discussions with Qatar and Saudi Arabia
to supply it with the needed quantities of natural gas. Among the options being considered are renting a
ship with an liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal to import gas from Qatar (would be operational in about
18 months), or equipping the Aqaba port with an LNG terminal (which would take about 2 years to
complete). There are also ongoing efforts to develop domestic sources of energy at the Risha field, as well as
a shift to renewable sources of energy.
Staff incorporated in their projections the potential effects of ongoing disruptions to gas supplies, and
the near term outlook is moderately more optimistic (meaning fewer gas supply disruptions) in 2012. The
estimates assume some improvement in Sinai Peninsula security and accordingly that gas imports from
Egypt in 2012 would be higher than in 2011.

Box 3. Jordan’s Fiscal Consolidation Efforts
To assess the effectiveness of the fiscal consolidation efforts by Jordan, it is necessary to determine
the actual contribution of fiscal policy in the reduction of fiscal deficits. Given that fiscal outcomes are
affected by economic fluctuations and external flows (that is, revenues go up in a boom, and/or when grants
are received), it is crucial to factor out exogenous fluctuations and cyclical factors affecting the fiscal balance.
For the case of Jordan, it is essential to focus on policy
instruments (that is, discretionary spending, or tax rates)
as opposed to policy outcomes (such as overall fiscal
balances, or tax revenues), particularly given the
importance of grants, and exogenous shocks affecting
fiscal revenues. Hence, the change in the structural
balance is a better measure to assess actual fiscal policy
underlying the fiscal consolidation plans.1

At the moment, the Jordanian economy is in the
downward phase of the business cycle as output gaps
are deteriorating. Nevertheless, fiscal policy is
contractionary, given that the structural balance, as well
as the primary balance excluding grants, are both
improving (see Figure 1).
For 2012, the structural deficit is projected to be
reduced by 4 percentage points of potential GDP,
whereas the unadjusted primary deficit excluding grants is
projected to be reduced by around 3 percentage points
of GDP (see Figure 2).
The level and the change in the structural balance for
2012 and 2013 indicate that substantial fiscal efforts are
projected to be implemented during this year and next,
but there remains scope to implement additional fiscal
measures over the medium term.

Box 4. Exchange Rate Assessment
Jordan’s real effective exchange rate appears broadly in line with its medium-term fundamentals. After
several years of decline in line with the weakening U.S. dollar, the trajectories of the trade-weighted nominal
effective (NEER) and real effective exchange rates (REER) and tourism-based measures1 of the real exchange rate
index indicate a modest appreciation—ranging from 0 to 3 percent—relative to their end-2009 values, driven by
rising inflation differentials with trading partners.

Jordan’s robust export performance in recent years also suggests that the country does not face major
competitiveness problems, but recent regional instability poses a challenge. Both goods and services export
receipts are estimated to have grown by about 11 percent on average over the past five years (2007–11). Among
services exports, the important tourism receipts, which account for about one quarter of exports of goods and
services, has been adversely affected by regional instability during 2011, as reflected in sharp decrease in tourist
arrival numbers.

Box 4. Exchange Rate Assessment (concluded)
Estimates from the IMF’s three Consultative Group on Exchange Rate (CGER)-based methodologies for
exchange rate evaluation—based on the projected level of the current account over the medium term (2017)—
do not yield evidence of exchange rate misalignment (see Table).2 The macroeconomic balance and equilibrium real
exchange rate approaches suggest that the exchange rate is broadly in equilibrium over the medium term
(overvalued by between 2.2 and 2.5 percent), while the external sustainability approach points to a small
undervaluation (by 4.6 percent). On average, there is little indication of a misalignment of the Jordanian dinar’s real
effective exchange rate for the medium term (2017), with the actual REER calculated as undervalued by 1½ percent
vis-à-vis the equilibrium REER.
Estimates from alternative exchange rate evaluation methodologies3—based on a developing country-specific
(including Middle East countries) version of the CGER macroeconomic balance approach to the current account—
indicate that while Jordanian current account imbalances have exhibited large fluctuations over time, these have
narrowed since 2007, pointing to a current account position close to the current account norm.
There is little evidence of real exchange rate misalignment. Using the macroeconomic balance approach, Fund
staff estimate Jordan’s equilibrium current account deficit under current policies (the current account ‘norm’) at
around 6 percent of GDP. Jordan’s projected

Box 5. Jordan’s Readiness for Basel III
Basel II implementation is progressing well. The Central Bank of Jordan (CBJ) has now issued all the
regulations for Basel II implementation, including those related to Pillars I, II, and III. The bottom-up stress
testing exercise, as a part of Pillar II, is underway. The CBJ in May 2011 started conducting its Supervisory
Review and Evaluation Process (SREP) on banks’ submitted Internal Capital Adequacy and Assessment
Processes (ICAAPs) by visiting them, in collaboration with external auditing firms, to validate the stress
tests conducted by banks.
The CBJ is studying the effects of implementing Basel III on the banking sector, and is planning to
initiate the implementation of the new accords in 2013, (in one shot or more gradually, depending on
the findings of the study). A circular was issued to licensed banks in October 2011, requiring them
to provide detailed impact studies of Basel III on capital adequacy and liquidity, taking into account
phase-in-arrangements set by the Basel Committee. The deadline for providing the CBJ with the results of
the impact study is June, 2012.
Basel III proposes many new capital, leverage and liquidity standards to strengthen banking
regulation, supervision and risk management. The capital standards and new capital buffers
(conservation and countercyclical) raise the quality and quantity of the regulatory capital base and
enhance the risk coverage of the capital framework. The new leverage ratio serves as a backstop to the
risk-based minimum capital requirements (and is intended to contain excessive leverage taking in the
banking system). The new liquidity ratios (Liquidity Coverage Ratio—LCR—and Net Stable Funding
Ratio—NSFR) ensure that adequate funding is maintained in case of crisis.
Jordan is well placed to implement Basel III. The CBJ is working on harmonizing definitions,
classifications and methodologies to calculate various Basel III metrics, and on finalizing the development
of a comprehensive and automated database, possibly by end-2012, to be used to improve off-site
monitoring of banks and allow for a statistical-based Early Warning System.
Most banks in Jordan meet the capital adequacy requirements of Basel III and the main share of
banks’’capital is Tier 1 (most banks hold capital either as paid up or in reserves). Table 1 shows that
Jordanian banks hold capital (currently at 18.2 percent of risk weighted assets) well in excess of the
CBJ’s regulatory minimum (12 percent) and well in excess of Basel III standards (which is set to increase
from 8 to 10.5 percent between 2013 and 2019, including the 2.5 percent conservation buffer). The CBJ is
revising liquidity definitions to align them with Basel III, but given that the two largest banks in Jordan
(Arab Bank and Housing Bank) are heavily liquid, the CBJ does not expect the revised ratios to fall short of
Basel III requirements. Banks in Jordan are conservative in their funding practices (with the JD
loan/deposit ratio near 73 percent at December 2011). This is partly due to their reliance on deposits,
sourced largely from the Jordanian diaspora and the region.

Box 6. Jordan: Business Environment and Governance
Jordan compares relatively well among MENA countries on competitiveness measures. According
to the 2010 World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Report, Jordan was ranked second to
Tunisia among oil-importing countries of the MENA region. Jordan ranks 96th on the World Bank’s
2012 Ease of Doing Business indicators, although improvement in the past five years remains relatively
muted. Constraints in the area of tax, tax administration, and licensing still remain, with 40 percent of
firms identifying them as major constraints to doing business (according to the World Bank’s Enterprise
Surveys). Furthermore, with the share of population aged 40 or under at above 33 percent, labor
market pressures are expected to remain high.
Jordan outperforms its peers in MENAP (Middle East, North Africa, Afghanistan and Pakistan) in
governance measures, including voice and accountability, rule of law, and control of corruption.
While voice and accountability measures have worsened in MENAP countries between 2000 and 2009,
the deterioration has been significant in Jordan.

Box 7. The National Aid Fund
The National Aid Fund (NAF) is the primary agency responsible for distributing cash assistance
in Jordan. It was established in 1986, following the elimination of food subsidies, to provide a more
formal social safety net for the unemployable poor. By the late 1990s, the NAF had emerged as the
single most comprehensive state-funded social safety net. In recent years, it has shifted its assistance
away from the strict application of categorical criteria to a more flexible approach in identifying
beneficiaries. In 2008, the NAF was expanded with the goal of mitigating the impact of the food and
fuel crisis by raising the ceiling of recurring aid disbursed to beneficiary families and broadening the
base of entitled beneficiaries to include the poor in casual employment. In 2010, the NAF’s budget
amounted to more than JD 78 million (0.4 percent of GDP), with about 88,000 beneficiaries (1.4 percent
of the population).

The NAF includes 5 main programs:


Recurring Financial Aid Program (RFAP), to raise the income of poor families;

Care for the Handicapped Program, to provide income support to poor households to cover
the cost of looking after handicapped family members;




Emergency Financial Aid Program, to help poor families deal with accidents or emergencies;

Physical Rehabilitation Program, to provide financial assistance to purchase essential medical
equipment and supplies for those in special physical needs to help them perform social and
productive functions; and



Vocational Training and Rehabilitation
Program, to provide suitable job opportunities
for the children of poor beneficiary families, in
coordination with specialist training bodies.



Eligibility for all the above programs is
conditioned on the family being of Jordanian
nationality and permanently resident in Jordan, as
well as providing evidence of household monthly
income, which needs to be lower than a specified
threshold. With over JD 74 million in expenditure
and 73,000 beneficiaries in 2010, the RFAP accounts
for about 95 percent of the total NAF budget.

2011, while banks' excess reserves have fallen.
Banks' excess liquidity has moderated, yet remains
sizeable.

The interest differential with the U.S has risen.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Annex 2. Jordan: External Debt Sustainability Analysis
Jordan’s external debt is relatively low but
remains vulnerable to adverse shocks.
The external debt ratio, which declined sharply
to about 25 percent of GDP following the
$2.1 billion buyback of Paris club debt in 2008,
is expected to maintain a downward trajectory
and decline to 21 percent by end-2012.
The updated debt sustainability analysis
indicates that as a result of strong fiscal
adjustment envisaged, external debt
appears to have a long-run downward path.
The projections are based on the current
outlook for commodity prices (particularly
grains and fuel), and assume some
improvement in regional security and hence
higher natural gas imports from Egypt in 2012.
In addition, they assume that the Jordanian
economy is able to secure better fuel contracts
in 2012 than in 2011, and that Jordan is able to
diversify to access alternative energy sources
by 2013. The projections also assume that
Jordan will continue to pursue cautious
external borrowing policies, relying
predominantly on concessional sources of
external financing from multilateral and
regional development banks.

15 nd 13 percent of GDP in 2012 and 2013,
respectively (see text table)).7 Under this
scenario, the debt ratio deteriorates to
about 24 percent by end-2012, and
reaches 26 percent by end-2013.
Jordan. Impact of Natural Gas on the Current
Account Under Alternative Scenarios
2010

A major downside risk is continued
disruption of natural gas supplies from
Egypt in 2012 and 2013 on a scale similar
to that experienced in 2011. The impact of
such a scenario would be a 4½ percent
and 3⅓ percent increase in the energy
import bill in 2012 and 2013, respectively,
relative to 2011 (a 15 percent increase over
the 2012 and 2013 baselines, reaching



An important source of risk is a sharper
slowdown in current account inflows and
FDI if the global/regional downturn proves
deeper than currently expected. The
impact of such a slowdown is illustrated in
an alternative scenario that envisages
a large 20 percent decline in 2012–13 in
remittances and tourism flows, as well as
FDI, relative to the baseline.8 Under this
scenario, the debt ratio deteriorates to
about 41 percent by end-2013.



The standard bound tests reveal that
external debt sustainability is most

However, the envisaged debt path is
somewhat sensitive to assumptions about
natural gas supplies and the global/regional
outlook (Table A.2):

The total impact of the shock is likely understated,
since economic growth is assumed to be unaffected by
the higher import costs and uncertainty associated

vulnerable to developments in the current
account position. If the actual current
account were half of one standard
deviation worse than currently assumed,
the debt ratio would edge up throughout
the projection period (reaching 41 percent
of GDP by 2017).



Bound tests show that the debt-to-GDP
ratio is robust to shocks in the external
interest rate or GDP growth. A sharp
depreciation would lead to an immediate
deterioration in the debt ratio but would
not have a major adverse impact over time
because of the relatively low stock of
projected external debt.

1/ Derived as [r - g - (1+g) + (1+r)]/(1+g++g) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms, g = real GDP growth rate,
 = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and  = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-(1+g(1+r1+g++g) times previous period debt stock. increases with an appreciating domestic currency (> 0) and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ The large residual term in 2008 reflects a Paris Club debt buyback of 11 percent of GDP. For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels

Safeguards Assessment: Under the Fund’s
safeguards assessment policy, the CBJ was subject
to a full assessment with respect to the Stand-By
Arrangement (SBA), which was approved on
July 3, 2002 and expired on July 2, 2004. The
assessment was completed on June 27, 2003 and
concluded that the CBJ has made progress in
strengthening its safeguards, as recommended in
the previous assessment of May 2001. The
assessment proposed a set of measures, the
majority of which have been implemented.
Exchange System: The Jordanian dinar is fully
convertible and is officially pegged to the SDR. In
practice, the authorities have an exchange rate
regime which is pegged to the U.S. dollar since
October 1995 at JD 1 = $1.41044. Jordan
accepted the obligations of Article VIII,
Sections 2, 3, and 4 in 1995 and maintains an
exchange system free of restrictions on payments
and transfers for current international
transactions.

ANNEX II. JORDAN—WORLD BANK GROUP STRATEGY
AND OPERATIONS
As of January 31, 2012,
1.
the World Bank has approved 67 loans,
15 credits and seven grants for a total of
US$3.262 billion. Of the 67 loans, ten are for
budget support operations (Development
Policy Loans (DPLs)). The current portfolio,
valued at US$288.5 million, consists of
seven investment projects amounting to
US$243.5 million of which US$119.4 million are
undisbursed, and one guarantee operation
valued at US$45 million. The performance of
the portfolio, which had been strong in the
past, began deteriorating at the end of 2010,
and there are now six projects in problem
status. Factors contributing to the
deterioration in performance include complex
project design, lack of ownership, interruptions
in counterpart financing, and low capacity of
implementing agencies. Frequent change of
leadership within ministries has also affected
project performance.
2.
The Joint World Bank-IFC Country
Partnership Strategy (CPS) for FY 2012–15,
endorsed by the Bank’s Executive Board in
January 2012, will support Jordan in its efforts
to lay a foundation for sustainable growth and
job creation through a three- pronged
strategy:


Strengthen fiscal management and
increase accountability



Strengthen the foundation for
sustainable growth with a focus on
competitiveness; and



Enhance inclusion through social
protection and local development.

3.
In light of Government’s increased
focus on transparency, public participation and
Government accountability, the WBG will seek
opportunities to support these efforts across
the portfolio.
4.
In the context of the new CPS, which
presents an indicative IBRD envelope of
US$500 to US$650 million for the FY2012–15
period, the Bank approved a First
Programmatic Development Policy Loan in the
amount of US$250 million on January 24, 2012.
This is the first in a programmatic DPL series
that focuses on: (i) transparency and
accountability; (ii) budget and debt
management; (iii) efficiency of government
spending and services; and (iv) private sector
development. The second DPL in the series is
planned for delivery around December 2012.
The new CPS also includes plans for a Partial
Risk Guarantee in electricity generation and a
robust TA program in the areas of subsidy
reform (analysis of the poverty impacts and
policy implications of changes in subsidy
regimes and options for improved targeting
mechanisms); public financial management;
governance; women’s labor force participation;
and support to the development and
implementation of an employment strategy
and a poverty reduction strategy.
5.
In addition, several pieces of analytical
work will be undertaken, including a
Development Policy Review which examines
productivity and sources of growth as well as
the relationship between these factors and job
creation, a Fiscal Consolidation Study which
will focus on the revenue side of public finance

and a review of public expenditures in the
energy sector, and a Gender Assessment.

during the last few years, and its portfolio has
grown from US$50 million at end FY05 to

the recent years and has undertaken an
extensive program of Advisory Services to

ANNEX III. JORDAN—STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of February 3, 2012)

I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is adequate for surveillance purposes.
National Accounts: During the past few years, progress has been made toward enhancing the
quality of national accounts statistics. This work has mainly focused on improving quarterly
estimates of the national accounts from the production approach. While work has commenced,
additional efforts are needed to develop annual national accounts from the expenditure
approach, as well as the coverage of informal activities. Also, work on reducing discrepancies
between the industrial production index and the gross value added estimates for the
manufacturing sector is progressing. New surveys have been implemented to improve the
compilation and timeliness of wages and earnings data. In mid-2011, the authorities revised the
national accounts GDP (real and nominal) data for 2007 to 2010, to address methodological
discrepancies in imputed rent values.
Government finance. The authorities have initiated work aimed at developing a financial
balance sheet in accordance with the classification and sectorization systems recommended by
the GFSM 2001 aimed at further strengthening the stock and flow data that serve as a source for
compiling government finance statistics and for verification of internal and intersectoral
consistency.
Monetary statistics: Timeliness of reporting monetary data for publication in International
Financial Statistics is satisfactory. However, little progress has been achieved so far in
implementing the Standardized Report Forms for reporting monetary data to the Fund.
Balance of payments: The CBJ has adopted the methodology of the fifth edition of the Balance
of Payments Manual (BPM5) for the compilation of the BOP statistics and the international
investment position (IIP), and has disseminated data in the BPM5 format. The implementation of
surveys in the area of services is important for further improving the quality of the BOP statistics.
In mid-2011 the CBJ revised the historical BOP data for 2008 to 2010, to address the sharp
increase in errors and omissions.

II. Data Standards and Quality
Subscriber to the Fund’s Special Data
Dissemination Standard (SDDS) since January
2010. Uses SDDS flexibility option on the
periodicity and timeliness of the labor market
wages/earnings data.

Data quality—methodological
soundness 8/

Statement by the Staff Representative on Jordan
April 9, 2012
The information below has become available following the issuance of the staff report. The
thrust of the staff appraisal remains unchanged, but recent trends, if continued, could entail a
financing need in 2012.
1.
Latest data on economic activity confirm a continued rebound from the nadir
of 2010. GDP growth for 2011 reached 2.6 percent, slightly above expectations. This
momentum continued into the fourth quarter of 2011, where GDP increased by 3.1 percent
due to strong performance in the manufacturing, transportation, and financial services
sectors.
2.
The drawdown of international reserves accelerated in the first quarter of 2012.
Compared to end-December 2011, reserves fell by almost US$1.1 billion (10.6 percent) to
reach US$9.6 billion (representing about 5.6 months of import cover) by end-March. This
pace of reserve drawdown is faster than expected with reserves already below the level
projected for end-2012. This is due mainly to higher prices of oil imports and the continued
need to substitute more expensive refined fuel products for natural gas (to use as an
alternate fuel for electricity generation). In particular, since the most recent sabotage of the
Arab Gas Pipeline on the Sinai Peninsula on February 5, 2012―the thirteenth time since
January 2011―there has been no flow of natural gas from Egypt to Jordan, which, if not
reinstated, could have major implications for the balance of payments.
3.
Recent modifications to the structure of electricity pricing are being revised.
The authorities raised electricity prices for large consumers on February 1. However, on
March 13 the revised electricity pricing schedule was withdrawn, due to customer complaints
about billing irregularities. The authorities have formed a committee of inquiry to examine
this issue, which will recommend a revised pricing schedule that progressively increases
prices for higher consumption, and entails a higher average price for electricity consumers.

In financial markets, the broad gains seen in late February have been
maintained. During March, spreads on sovereign bonds narrowed and the stock market
strengthened, while long-term domestic bonds weakened.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation with Jordan
On April 9, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Jordan.1
Background
The pace of economic activity in Jordan remains subdued. Following a period of robust growth
during 2000–09 (averaging about 6½ percent) supported by a favorable external environment,
economic activity slowed sharply. Real GDP grew by only 2⅓ percent in 2010, and headline
inflation picked up to 5 percent, in line with higher commodity prices. A modest increase in
economic activity took place in 2011, as real GDP is expected to grow by 2½ percent. Inflation
fell to 4½ percent in 2011, due in large part to the absence (since January 2011) of pass
through of international oil prices to domestic markets. Real GDP is likely to grow by 2¾ percent
in 2012, underpinned by modest growth in mining and financial services and continued growth
in key trading-partner Gulf Cooperation Council countries. Average inflation should rise to
almost 6 percent in 2012, given the planned resumption of pass-through of international oil
prices to domestic fuel prices. As one of the most open economies in the Middle East, Jordan
remains highly dependent on commodity imports (oil and grains), tourism receipts, remittances
and FDI flows, and external grants. Jordan is also facing risks from a further deterioration in its
terms of trade, unrest in neighboring countries, and the prospect of further disruptions to natural
gas pipeline flows from Egypt.
Higher world commodity prices have adversely affected Jordan’s external position. The external
current account deficit is expected to widen considerably to 9½ percent of GDP in 2011 (from
5⅔ percent of GDP in 2010), as a robust export performance is offset by increased energy
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares
a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the
Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this
summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can

imports and declining remittances and tourism receipts. International reserves fell by 14 percent
in 2011 to reach $10.7 billion (equivalent to 6⅔ months of imports), as shortfalls in foreign direct
investment flows accompanied the deterioration in the current account. Despite regional
uncertainties, the current account deficit is projected to narrow in 2012 (reaching 8 percent of
GDP), due to a moderation of energy imports and buoyant mining exports.
Increased social spending has exacerbated pressures on the fiscal position, and tighter
macroeconomic policies are needed to reduce fiscal and external imbalances. The overall fiscal
deficit is expected to rise to about 6 percent of GDP in 2011, mainly due to increased
commodity subsidies and other social spending (costing an additional 2⅓ percent of GDP) and
a cyclical weakening in domestic revenues. Budgetary grants of $1.4 billion (5 percent of GDP)
were provided by Saudi Arabia during 2011, which helped fund the cost of fuel subsidies. In
addition to central government borrowing, increased government borrowing on behalf of
Jordan’s National Electric Power Company (to cover more costly imported fuel oil used during
the extensive periods of interrupted natural gas supply) and other own-budget agencies
increased the public debt-to-GDP ratio to about 64 percent at end-2011.
The 2012 budget envisages considerable fiscal consolidation. The budget focuses on raising
domestic revenue (including by removing tax exemptions, revamping property transfer fees, and
higher tax rates on luxury goods) and containing current spending (including by freezing public
sector hiring, reductions in the operational costs of Ministries, and reform of the present system
of universal subsidies for gasoline and diesel). The budget also provides for the implementation
of targeted transfers to alleviate higher fuel costs associated with the phasing out of fuel
subsidies. Based on the latest developments and macroeconomic assumptions, the 2012
overall deficit is expected to narrow by about 1 percent of GDP relative to the 2011 outturn,
reaching 5¼ percent of GDP. With this, and given likely borrowing for own-budget entities, the
public debt-to-GDP ratio would rise slightly to 65½ percent by end-2012. Further fiscal
consolidation will be essential over the medium term to return fiscal and external balances to a
sustainable level.
The stance of monetary policy has been tightened since mid-2011. As recent unrest in the
region is likely to have engendered rising sovereign risk premia in Jordan and other Middle East
countries, further tightening of monetary conditions is appropriate, to sustain the attractiveness
of Jordanian dinar (JD)-denominated assets and strengthen the international reserve position.
In this connection, safeguarding the exchange rate peg remains the lynchpin for the
maintenance of financial stability in Jordan. The peg of the Jordanian dinar to the U.S. dollar
has served the country well by anchoring inflation expectations and providing stability in
a challenging regional and global environment. The Jordanian dinar real effective exchange rate
has experienced a modest appreciation of 2½ percent between December 2009 and
November 2011, driven largely by rising inflation differentials with trading partners.
The Jordanian banking system remains sound. The Central Bank of Jordan (CBJ) continues to
exercise prudent regulation and supervision of the banking system, and banks have remained
conservative in their funding practices (with the JD loan/deposit ratio near 73 percent at

3
December 2011). The banking sector’s macro-prudential indicators remain strong—banks
remain profitable and well capitalized, deposits (largely JD-denominated) continue to be the
major funding base, liquidity ratios and provisioning remain high, while non-performing loans
increased slightly to 8½ percent at mid-2011. Bank private sector credit continues to rebound
(growing by 9½ percent y-o-y in December 2011).
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities’ track record of prudent and effective
macroeconomic management, but noted that external and domestic shocks have recently
dampened economic activity and heightened downside risks. Against this background, Directors
agreed that, going forward, economic, financial and structural policies should focus on reducing
fiscal and external imbalances as well as on promoting faster and more inclusive GDP growth.
Directors welcomed the fiscal tightening in the 2012 budget and the authorities’ three-year fiscal
reform agenda. More broadly, they underscored the importance of a comprehensive
medium-term strategy to restore fiscal buffers and reduce the public debt. Such a strategy
should encompass enhanced tax administration, further fuel subsidy reforms, better-targeted
social and capital spending, continued containment of the public sector wage bill, and improved
public sector financial management.
Directors considered that the exchange rate peg has served Jordan well in anchoring inflation
expectations and fostering macroeconomic stability. Director also agreed that, in the context of
this exchange rate regime, there is scope for a further tightening of the monetary stance to
contain inflation risks and maintain an adequate international reserve buffer.
Directors welcomed improvements in banking regulation and supervision in line with the
recommendations under the Fund’s Financial Sector Assessment Program, which have helped
create a liquid, well-capitalized, and profitable banking sector. They encouraged continued
vigilance against financial risks, particularly from rising non-performing loans. Directors
commended the progress in implementing Basel II regulations, noting that banks are already
well placed to satisfy Basel III guidelines on capital adequacy and liquidity. They also welcomed
the authorities’ continued efforts to fight money laundering and terrorism financing.
Directors underscored that sustained and inclusive growth is central to reducing high and
chronic unemployment. They welcomed the steps taken to boost the investment climate,
governance, and regional trade. Nonetheless, Directors urged further progress in strengthening
the legal and regulatory frameworks, addressing labor market rigidities, resolving skill
mismatches, and tackling infrastructure bottlenecks.

Statement by Shakour Shaalan, Executive Director for Jordan
April 9, 2012
1. On behalf of the Jordanian authorities, I would like to thank staff for the constructive
dialogue and candid advice during Article IV Consultation. The focus on the fiscal and
financial reforms that are needed to preserve macroeconomic stability, as well as measures to
boost inclusive growth and generate employment opportunities is timely and appropriate. The
authorities broadly concur with staff’s assessment and recommendations.
Recent developments
2. Economic activity in Jordan has slowed considerably over the last two years, reflecting the
combined global economic crisis and the heightened regional unrest. As one of the most open
and energy-dependent country, Jordan remains vulnerable to external developments, though
resilience to external shocks has strengthened over the years. Higher international prices and
frequent disruption of the supply of natural gas from Egypt have strained the fiscal and
external balances and if it continues could raise borrowing costs. Meanwhile, worker
remittances and tourism receipts declined due to regional unrest, which has dampened
growth and employment, and also created a drain on reserves, although these remain at a
comfortable level. The spillovers negatively affected investor confidence and the cost of
borrowing despite a track record of sound macroeconomic management.
3. However, recent data point to stronger GDP growth in Q4 of 2011 relative to the previous
quarter. Furthermore, the tourism sector saw a modest recovery in the first quarter of 2012,
supported by medical tourism. If these trends continue, they will likely yield higher growth in
2012 relative to staff’s projection.
4. Financial soundness indicators point to the continued strength and resilience of the
banking system, notwithstanding the difficult domestic environment, reflecting strong
regulation and supervision by the central bank. Banks remain well capitalized, profitable,
with deposits being the major source of funding.
5. Faced with some temporary adversities, the authorities will spare no effort to maintain the
hard won gains in macroeconomic stability and restore confidence in the economy, building
on their strong institutional capacity. Jordan has over the past several years clearly
demonstrated its commitment to sound economic policies and wide-ranging reforms.
However, in the current environment, rising expectations and pressures for social spending
could render the achievement of their fiscal objectives more challenging. To mitigate such
pressures and in order to gather strong public support to reforms, Jordan established an
Economic Dialogue Committee whose key responsibility is to build a common view on
major economic challenges and priorities. A consensus emerged stipulating the need to
ensure fiscal and external sustainability, fight poverty and enhancing social safety net, create
adequate job opportunities, and enhance the quality of government services, among others.
The authorities fully support these objectives.

2

Economic outlook
6. The authorities expect the growth momentum to pick up over the medium term, albeit at a
gradual pace, in line with the global outlook and the uncertainty in the region. Jordan’s
economy is tied closely to the GCC countries, which are the primary source of remittances,
grants, tourism receipts, FDI, and - to a lesser extent - exports. Continued growth in the GCC
economies will help boost activity, as well as the expansion in mining and financial services
activity. Pressures on the balance of payments and the fiscal position are also expected to
ease due to moderation in oil imports and continuing fiscal consolidation. While less
interruption of the Egyptian natural gas supply is anticipated going forward, the authorities
are discussing various options, including with Saudi Arabia and Qatar, to diversify their gas
supply sources.
7. To make growth more inclusive, the authorities will continue to enhance private sector
participation in the economy by further improving the business climate and the quality of
public services and investment. While the unemployment rate has dropped significantly from
the level prevailing over the past two decades, it has stabilized at around 13 percent over the
past few years. The authorities are aware of the limited impact of slow economic growth on
employment creation. They remain confident, however, that their plans and initiatives in this
direction will bear fruits over the medium term. The current initiatives include supporting a
more competitive business climate for SMEs and enhancing their access to finance,
addressing the skill mismatch problem by expanding vocational training, facilitating job
creation at the governorates level, and nurturing the development of sectors with large
employment opportunities, such as the tourism and information technology sectors.
Fiscal policy reforms
8. While protecting priority social spending, the authorities’ budget for 2012 entails sizable
fiscal consolidation, which aims to build fiscal space and contain borrowing costs. A threeyear fiscal reform agenda has been approved in order to build public support to fiscal
reforms, and to further enhance transparency of fiscal operations and accountability. To rein
in the fiscal deficit in 2012, the authorities will phase out some inefficient tax exemptions,
broaden the coverage of the tax base, and raise taxes on luxury goods. On the expenditure
side, the authorities will reinstate the automatic fuel pricing mechanism and abandon the
general commodity subsidies in favor of a well-targeted system. This will create the needed
fiscal space to boost capital spending from its current historically low level.
9. Moreover, they have taken some additional measures to mitigate the impact of the
continuing rise in oil price on the 2012 budget. These include rationalizing energy
consumption on public roads by switching off lighting at earlier hours and raising fees and
registration licenses on several government services. In addition, electricity prices were
recently raised but are currently being revised again to take account of anomalies discovered
in the price structure. In this connection, it is worth noting that despite the authorities’
decision to freeze domestic oil prices in early 2011, these prices remain among the highest
and least subsidized in oil-importing Middle East countries. High oil prices are purely an

3
external shock, which is creating liquidity constraints and interrupted the ongoing fiscal
consolidation and improvement in public debt management.
10. Over the medium term, the strategy focuses on minimizing vulnerabilities and reducing
remaining distortions. The authorities are more confident than staff that the planned fiscal
measures will contibute to meeting their fiscal target, and they stand ready to identify
additional measures in due course, as needed.
Monetary policy and financial sector issues
11. Monetary policy has been accommodative since the onset of the global financial crisis in
2008. However, the central bank started to tighten the monetary stance since June 2011 in
order to anchor the rising inflation expectations, stem the loss in international reserves, and
enhance the attractiveness of the domestic currency denominated assets. Policy rates were
raised further in February of this year. The central bank stands ready for further tightening of
its monetary stance if market conditions warrant.
12. The pegged exchange rate regime continues to serve the Jordanian economy well and is a
key contributor to financial stability, in particular during the ongoing turmoil in the global
and regional financial markets. While the real effective exchange rate has appreciated
modestly, staff’s analysis confirms the central bank’s assessment that the real effective
exchange rate remains broadly in line with medium-term fundamentals. The comfortable
level of international reserves also provides an important buffer against shocks and enhances
confidence in domestic currency. As revealed by Staff’s assessment of the reserve adequacy
in Jordan using three different methodologies in Chapter III of the Selected Issues, the
current level remains higher than the minimum suggested by the three measures.
13. The banking sector remains well-supervised, highly capitalized, and profitable. Banks
also have proven resilience to external and domestic shocks, remain conservative in their
funding practices, and maintain high liquidity ratios. Credit to private sector is expected to
pick up further in 2012, which might provide additional boost to banks’ income. In addition,
practical steps have been taken to establish the first credit bureau in Jordan which is
projected to start operating by end 2012. However, staff points to the risk of banks’ exposure
to higher levels of non-performing loans and provisioning requirement over the medium
term. In this regard, it is worth mentioning that the central bank continues to monitor banks’
exposures, and stands ready to take remedial actions if such scenario materializes.
Additionally, almost all of the recommendations of the 2008 FSAP update were
implemented, and there has been significant progress in implementing Basel II. Indeed,
banks already meet the capital adequacy requirements of Basel III, and the central bank
expects liquidity standards to be satisfied.
14. In conclusion, the Jordanian economy will remain among the most dynamic economies in
the region, benefitting from its solid fundamentals, a stable political and security situation,
and broad-based commitment to sound policies. While Jordan has a limited endowment of
natural resources, its skilled human capital will remain its primary asset. The current
pressures facing the economy are exogenous, related to gas pipeline disruption, higher oil

4
prices, and lower tourism receipts due to the regional unrest. Jordan is well placed to
overcome them, given its strong policy framework following 23 years of crucial reforms, of
which 15 years were under Fund programs.
