EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Impact of the crisis
Despite its large vulnerabilities, Lebanon has so far weathered the global financial crisis and
succeeded in maintaining financial stability, raising international reserves, and reducing
public debt in 2008. The economy achieved record growth, and Eurobond spreads are now
lower than the emerging market average. Fund engagement in Lebanon through the EPCA
(which was broadly on track at end-December) has contributed to this performance. Lower
global liquidity and the world economic downturn, particularly in the Gulf, will likely affect
Lebanon in 2009, with lower growth and deposit inflows.
Policy discussions
Lebanon’s economy and financial system face three key risks: a larger-than-expected impact
of the global recession and slowdown in the Gulf; more difficult-than-anticipated
government financing; and political and security shocks, particularly in coincidence with the
June elections. To address these risks, the authorities intend to:
•

Further accumulate reserves to preserve confidence through a sufficiently high
interest rate differential between domestic currency and foreign currency rates;

•

Maintain the debt-to-GDP ratio constant to protect fiscal achievements and
allowing the 2009 financing needs to be met from the market, while addressing the
potential social needs arising from the effects of the global recession;

•

Step up their vigilance over the banking sector, as banks could be hit by a
stronger-than-expected fall in deposit growth or a worsening in loan quality.

The Paris III agenda will remain the anchor for medium-term plans focusing on continued
fiscal consolidation mainly through revenue measures, such as an increase in VAT rate, and
the reduction in the large losses at Electricité du Liban (EdL). In addition, the telecom
privatization would boost private sector activity and further reduce the debt.
Staff appraisal
•

Staff agrees with the authorities’ view of the risks in 2009, particularly in light of
their possible combined effect, which warrant the preparation of contingency plans;

•

Monetary and exchange rate policy is broadly appropriate, but, given the downside
risks, staff recommended a tighter fiscal stance in 2009 to keep unchanged financing
requirements and ensure continued debt reduction;

•

Restarting the medium-term Paris III agenda should be priority after the elections.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Despite its large vulnerabilities, Lebanon has so far weathered the global
financial crisis. Lebanon’s public debt-to-GDP ratio remains among the highest in the world.
Its banking system, with assets of more than three times nominal GDP, is highly exposed to
the sovereign, and dependent on deposit inflows from nonresidents. Moreover, the country
lies at the crossroads of regional and international political tensions. Despite these
challenges, Lebanon has managed to maintain financial stability since the global crisis
erupted in September 2008. There have been no pressures on the peg so far, and the
Banque du Liban (BdL) has continued to accumulate international reserves at a swift pace.
Deposit inflows took a short breather after the Lehman failure, but have resumed at a rapid
pace since then, and deposit dollarization has declined steadily. Eurobond and Credit Default
Swap (CDS) spreads are now below the emerging market average, and the banking system
has withstood the global financial crisis.

2.
The improved political and security situation has been crucial to this outcome.
The Doha agreement in May 2008 put an end to the armed fighting between supporters of the
majority and minority coalitions, and opened the way to the formation of a unity government
to take the country to the June 2009 general elections.
3.
Fund engagement in Lebanon through the EPCA policy has contributed to
the economy’s resilience. The authorities’ macroeconomic policies have been supported
by the international community—most notably at the Paris III donor conference in
January 2007—and by the Fund, through a quarterly monitoring framework and two
drawings under the Emergency Post-Conflict Assistance policy, in April 2007 and
November 2008.

6
Box 1. Performance Under EPCA and Implementation of Past Fund Advice
The end-December 2008 quantitative indicative targets have been met, but there are
some slippages in structural policies. The primary balance excluding grants and net
government borrowing from the BdL have comfortably met the respective targets, and gross
international reserves of the BdL have exceeded the target by $1.8 billion (around 10 percent of
reserves). Lower oil prices have reduced the pressure to adjust electricity tariffs (though
electricity subsidies remain significant), resulting in the non-observance of the corresponding
end-December monitorable action. In January 2009, the BdL established an investment
committee and prepared formal guidelines for foreign reserve management (end-December
monitorable action).
The authorities also reported progress toward achieving the end-March monitorable
actions. In part due to the worse international financial conditions, telecom privatization has
been postponed, and the associated monitorable action to launch the request for applications will
not be met. The draft Global Income Tax bill will be submitted to the Council of Ministers by
end-March and soon thereafter to Parliament, likely implying a minor delay in the corresponding
monitorable action. The BdL has already adopted the policies for the selection, appointment, and
rotation of external auditors (end-June monitorable action).
Economic policy since the Paris III conference has been broadly in line with the Fund’s
policy advice. The Paris III medium-term economic and reform program was developed in close
consultation with staff. While the planned fiscal consolidation and structural reforms have
repeatedly been postponed due to the difficult security situation and the worsening of the
political tensions between the government and the opposition, the Paris III program remains the
anchor for medium-term policy objectives. Implementation of the program supported by the first
drawing under EPCA was successful despite slippages in structural policies. The Fund has
supported the authorities’ view that the peg remains instrumental in maintaining financial
stability.

4.

Policy discussions focused on the authorities’ objectives:

•

In the near term, safeguarding the recent progress, in particular with regard to
international reserve accumulation and fiscal consolidation, and preparing the
economy to withstand the impact of a deepening global economic and financial crisis;

•

In the medium term, relaunching the Paris III agenda, and in particular sustained
debt reduction and structural reform.

7
II. NAVIGATING THE CRISIS
5.
The authorities’ policies in 2008 put Lebanon in a position to weather the first
round impact of the crisis:
•

Monetary and exchange rate policy aimed at building up international reserves.
To this end, the BdL allowed a growing deposit interest rate differential in favor of
the local currency in order to maintain confidence in the Lebanese financial system,
attract deposit inflows, and promote a de-dollarization of deposits.

Given the improved political
and macroeconomic situation,
Lebanon achieved record growth in
2008. With a pick-up in activity in the
second half of the year driven by
construction and tourism, real GDP
achieved a growth of more than 8 percent
for the year. In line with international
prices, inflation declined to 4 percent in
January 2009. Despite a strong export
performance (26 percent growth in
2008), high oil prices and strong
domestic demand pushed the current
account deficit to over 11 percent in 2008.

7.
However, the worsening international macroeconomic outlook will affect
Lebanon in 2009. The authorities expect lower global liquidity and the world economic
downturn, particularly in the Gulf, to affect remittances, tourism, foreign direct and portfolio
investment, as well as deposit inflows. Thus, growth is likely to slow to 3 percent this year
from over 8 percent in 2008, and deposit growth is expected to decline to 10 percent from
15 percent in 2008. Inflation will remain low, in line with international price trends. Lower
oil prices will reduce the current account deficit, even though the capital account will likely
weaken due to lower investment flows.

Box 2. The Lebanese Banking Sector in the Face of the Global Crisis
Banks have so far been little affected by the global financial crisis.
•

While commercial bank assets amount to 324 percent to GDP, one of the highest ratios among
emerging markets, banks source around 90 percent of their non-equity funding from deposits,

Banks suffer, however, from long-standing structural vulnerabilities. Commercial bank assets
are concentrated on the sovereign, which accounts for 55 percent of assets. Moreover, banks carry
a substantial maturity mismatch from funding their lending operations largely from short-term
deposits, and a significant indirect currency exposure from foreign exchange lending to unhedged
clients. Looking forward, the fall in the stock market (which at end-February had lost 26 percent
year-on-year), the end of the housing boom, and the projected economic slowdown more generally
could lead to an increase in non-performing loans (from 3.1 percent at end-2008), including from
regional operations. However, stress tests carried out by the Banking Control Commission (BCC)
have shown that banks could easily absorb a hypothetical increase in non-performing loans by
50 percent, to levels experienced after the 2006 war with Israel.

10
Box 3. Remittances in Lebanon
Remittances to Lebanon are among the highest in the world. Reflecting both a rising global trend
in remittances and the size of the Lebanese diaspora, gross remittances inflows have grown to an
estimated 20 percent of GDP in 2008, placing the country among the largest recipients of remittances
as a share of GDP in the world. With remittances outflows estimated at 8 percent of GDP, net
remittances inflows amounted to 12 percent of GDP.

The continuing global economic downturn is likely to lead to a marked decline in remittances.
Some 54 percent of remittances to Lebanon originate in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) and
another 16 percent in Australia, the US, and Canada. The projected decline in GDP growth in these
countries in 2009 is estimated to bring about a fall in gross and net remittances inflows of up to
12 percent (2.4 percent of GDP) and 25 percent (3 percent of GDP) respectively in 2009.

11
Box 4. Lebanon and the GCC
There are strong economic links between Lebanon and the GCC:
•

Remittances from Lebanese living in the GCC amount to around half of total gross
remittances to Lebanon. Anecdotal evidence and data on past migration flows suggest that up
to 400,000 Lebanese are living in the Gulf, in large part well-educated professionals.

•

The GCC countries are Lebanese exports’
largest market, with a share of 24 percent in
2007.

•

•

Tourists from the GCC are a significant
fraction of total tourists to Lebanon. In 2008,
they bought 48 percent of total hotel nights
(excluding Lebanese nationals). GCC nationals
also spend proportionately more than tourists
from other countries.

half of which has been in real estate. Lebanon
receives around one-third of all GCC investments to MENA countries. In addition, Gulf investors
are thought to hold a large number of the high-value deposits at Lebanese banks.

III. AUTHORITIES’ POLICIES FOR 2009 2
8.
The authorities see three key risks for the Lebanese economy and financial
system, which present considerable challenges to Lebanon, particularly if they materialize at
the same time:
•

First, the global recession and slowdown in the Gulf—even if cushioned by fiscal
expansion—will affect capital flows and economic activity in Lebanon. While a soft
landing in Lebanon remains the most likely outcome, there is a significant downside
risk to domestic activity.

•

Second, government financing may become more difficult than anticipated if the
fiscal stance is loosened, interest rates on government debt rise, or deposit inflows
slow down.

•

Third, Lebanon remains exposed to political and security shocks, particularly in the
run up to the elections.

The authorities aim at minimizing the possible impact of these risks by further increasing the
international reserve buffer, reducing fiscal vulnerabilities, containing financing needs, and
strengthening the banking sector this year.
2

Staff’s views are given in Section VI.

12
Box 5. Deposit Growth
Deposit growth remains the highest vulnerability to maintaining financial stability in
Lebanon. The country’s large fiscal deficits have been financed to a substantial degree by
domestic banks, which source their lending capacity largely from deposit growth. A severe
slowdown in deposit growth could hence impede government market financing.
Deposit growth has recently picked up markedly. Since the end of the civil war in 1990,
annual deposit growth never fell below 4 percent even in the face of marked domestic shocks
such as the near-debt crisis in 2002, the political turmoil after the assassination of former
Prime Minister Rafik Hariri in 2005, and the 2006 war with Israel and ensuing domestic
political deadlock (shaded areas in the figure below). During these crises, there were short-lived
outflows that were quickly recovered. Since mid-2008, deposit growth has picked up
considerably and, after a brief slowdown in the aftermath of the Lehman failure, reached
15.6 percent in December 2008.
A large share of deposit inflows comes from abroad, including the Gulf region. As a regional
financial center, the Lebanese banking system sources a substantial share of its deposits from
abroad. While reliable statistics are not available, anecdotal evidence points to the growing
importance of the GCC, a popular destination for emigrants and migrant workers during the
recent oil boom (see Box 4). Industrial countries, such as the United States, Canada, and
Australia, also host a substantial share of the Lebanese diaspora and are an important source of
Lebanese non-resident deposits (see Box 3).
Nonetheless, domestic factors appear to have a stronger bearing on deposit growth than
trends in the Gulf. Since the mid 1990s, deposit growth has moved broadly in line with the
interest differential between local currency and U.S. dollar-denominated deposits (left panel),
except during episodes of domestic shocks. However, deposit growth appears also to be
increasingly correlated to the economic cycle in the GCC (right panel).

A. Maintaining a Strong Reserve Buffer in Times of Uncertainty
9.
The BdL aims at further accumulating reserves to preserve confidence. To this
end, the BdL intends to support deposit growth by keeping the interest rate differential
between domestic currency and foreign currency rates at the current level. 3 The authorities
acknowledge that the policy of reserve accumulation is ultimately costly for the government,
the private sector, and the BdL balance sheet. Following the elections, they would consider a
further reduction in domestic currency interest rates only if deposit growth holds up at a
comfortable pace.
10.
The BdL continues to be of the view that maintaining the peg will serve as the
lynchpin for Lebanon’s financial stability. This is essential given the currency mismatches
deriving from both widespread deposit dollarization and the government’s high debt and debt
service obligations in foreign currency. In the authorities’ view, the lack of pressures on the
peg throughout 2008 and the beginning of 2009 constitutes further evidence of the
appropriateness of the

B. Containing the Government’s Financing Needs and Reducing Debt
11.
The authorities believe that, with the slowing down of economic activity, the
process of fiscal consolidation cannot continue this year as planned. In principle, the
authorities agree that domestic and external risks warrant an aggressive stance toward
reducing the public debt. However, they believe that, right now, fiscal consolidation
imperatives should be weighed against the potential social needs arising from the effects of
the global recession and the political pressures generated by the forthcoming elections.
12.
The authorities see the 2009 draft budget as a reasonable compromise between
these objectives. The budget envisages the primary balance (before grants) to fall to zero
from 0.5 percent of GDP in 2008. The overall fiscal deficit would increase to 12.3 percent of
GDP, 2.3 percentage points higher than 2008. The gross debt-to-GDP ratio would remain at
162 percent. Fiscal space has opened up this year with the reintroduction of gasoline excises
and the reduced need for budgetary transfers to Electricité du Liban (EdL) arising from lower
fuel costs. With delayed privatization of the mobile phone companies, the expected loss in
non-tax revenue in the second half of the year will not take place. In addition, the budget
includes the revenue measures envisaged under EPCA: increase in interest income tax, 4
removal of VAT refunds from exempted activities, imposition of rental charges on seashore
valuations, and capital gains tax on an exceptional revaluation of assets, (these measures
would yield 0.6 percent of GDP). These additional resources would finance increased

15
spending in wages and salaries (+2.1 percent of GDP over 2008), a part of which related to
enhancing security, and higher capital expenditures (+1.2 percent of GDP). 5
13.
The government is preparing an anti-crisis action package. The authorities bank
on the planned wage increases and one-off payments to public sector employees to boost real
incomes and prop up consumption at a time when external demand might be flagging. But, to
further counter the effect of the crisis, the authorities also prepared a draft anti-crisis plan that
includes an acceleration and reprioritization of infrastructure spending by the Council for
Development and Reconstruction, an expansion of interest subsidies for LL-denominated
bank lending to the corporate sector, various measures to improve the business climate, and
incentive programs to support job creation. The plan has not yet been fully costed, but the
authorities believe that it is unlikely to have a significant impact on the overall fiscal stance.
14.
Budget implementation will be prudent. The implementation of the draft budget
would still allow the authorities to meet the EPCA fiscal targets for March and June 2009. In
case of revenue shortfall or expenditure overruns, the authorities are ready to consider
additional measures to maintain the debt-to-GDP ratio constant. Should the budget fail to be
approved, a significant portion of spending would be based on the 2005 budget (the last to be
passed by parliament) and thus more easily contained, possibly bringing savings of up to
0.6 percent of GDP compared to the draft budget.

5

The wage bill is projected to increase by 2.1 percentage points of GDP in 2009. Of this increase,
0.9 percentage points derive from the full annual impact of the wage increase approved in September 2008. The
remaining 1.2 percentage points result from: a) one-off retroactive payments dating back to 1996-98 (0.65
points), b) an increase in the public sector grade scale (0.2 points), c) hiring of additional teachers, security
personnel and contractual public workers not subject to the public sector hiring freeze (0.3 points), and d) a
special allowance to the army (0.05 points).

16
Box 6. Social Safety Nets in Lebanon
Poverty in Lebanon is high. According to the UNDP, 28 percent and 8 percent of the
population in 2004-05 could be considered respectively poor and very poor. Poverty is
concentrated outside Beirut, in the North and in the South of the country. The Gini coefficient, at
0.37, was close to the MENA average; the bottom 20 percent of the population accounted for
7 percent of consumption, while the top 20 percent accounted for 43 percent of consumption.
Social spending in Lebanon is high, but its share specifically allocated to poor households
(i.e., safety nets) is small. While spending in education, health, pensions and social assistance
accounted approximately for 30 percent of primary expenditures in 2007, social assistance was
less than 20 percent of this amount. Significant budgetary resources are used for electricity
subsidies (transfers to EDL), which absorbed 23 percent of primary spending in 2008 but mainly
benefit the top income bracket customers, who consume more electricity per capita.
The effectiveness of safety nets is undermined by the lack of coordination between the
various providers. Most of the benefits financed through the Ministry of Social Affairs (MoSA)
are provided by a range of welfare institutions and non-governmental organizations contracted by
the MoSA, resulting in extensive overlaps and administrative waste.
The government developed in 2007 a Social Action Plan (SAP) to reduce poverty, improve
social indicators, and achieve the Millennium Development Goals. The SAP contains a
medium-term strategy to introduce safety net programs such as: i) cash transfers to the very poor
households; ii) school feeding, books, stationery, and transportation facilities to students living in
poor locations; and iii) free hospitalization for all households under the poverty line.
The MoSA, in conjunction with the World Bank, is now working on a National Targeting
Program (NTP). One of the main goals of the NTP is to develop a credible and reliable
database, enabling an objective assessment of households’ welfare so as to more effectively
target safety net programs. A pilot is now being conducted in three low-income districts, with the
objective of extending it gradually to the national level.

16.
The authorities are considering contingency plans in case financing difficulties
materialize. A discussion of stress tests developed by staff highlighted that the authorities’
financing plans are highly dependent on deposit growth, and underlined the importance of
preparing contingency plans. Should deposit growth slow to critical levels, the authorities
will consider a policy response that would include: (i) higher interest rates; (ii) a temporarily
lower accumulation of international reserves; (iii) further fiscal adjustment, such as
compression of discretionary spending, additional increases in excises and/or bringing
forward the VAT hike now slated for 2010; and (iv) efforts to mobilize additional donor
support.

18
C. Strengthening the Banking Sector
17.
The authorities are stepping up their vigilance over the banking sector. The
authorities believe that the banking system is in a good position to address a
stronger-than-expected fall in deposit growth, or a significant worsening in loan quality—in
Lebanon or in the regional operations—under the stress of the slowdown in the real
economy. Nevertheless, the BCC has strengthened reporting requirements on domestic and
foreign operations, carried out stress tests for the banking system and intensified on-site
inspections specifically aimed at assessing the impact of the global financial turbulence. To
further increase the already high capitalization of banks, the BdL has recently recommended
limiting dividend payments to 25 percent of 2008 profits. Finally, the BdL, in coordination
with the government and the BCC, has prepared draft legislation for the creation of the
regulatory authority for financial markets, which are currently supervised jointly by the BdL
and the BCC.
18.
In the authorities’ view, the current banking resolution framework provides for
a flexible response capability. The authorities recently enacted a revised bank merger law,
which enables the BdL to deal preemptively with troubled banks. The law, in line with past
practice, is designed to prevent to the extent possible bank failures, relying on mergers and
takeovers by sounder banks rather than outright bankruptcy. The authorities also developed
plans to reform the deposit insurance fund, the coverage of which, at just over $3000 per
depositor, is clearly inadequate. However, given the advantage of maintaining regulatory
stability at this time, they intend to proceed with this reform after international financial
conditions improve.
IV. MEDIUM-TERM PLANS TO TACKLE VULNERABILITIES
19.
There is broad agreement across the political spectrum that reducing the high
public debt-to-GDP ratio and launching structural reforms are the key medium-term
priorities. The outcome of the June 2009 elections is uncertain. However, the authorities’
view of the Paris III agenda as the anchor for medium-term plans is likely to be shared by
any future government. On that basis, medium-term fiscal tightening would mainly rely on
the already planned gradual increase in the VAT rate from 10 to 15 percent, the introduction
of the Global Income Tax, and cuts in non-essential expenditures. Further savings would
come from tackling the large losses at EdL—a key priority—since, despite the fall in
international oil prices, current electricity tariffs still imply a significant untargeted subsidy,
underscoring the need for a tariff revision. The authorities also see as a priority the launch of
the privatization of the mobile phone providers as soon as market conditions allow, thus
boosting private sector activity and reducing the debt.
20.
Timely and flexible disbursement of Paris III pledges is another important
element of the authorities’ strategy. While progress has been made in the disbursement of
these pledges, disbursements have fallen short of expectations partly because of political and
security conditions and longer than expected negotiations. Furthermore, given the relatively

19
insufficient share of budget support in the total, disbursements have not been fully aligned
with the goal of debt reduction.

Several structural fiscal reforms are under preparation. Parliament approved the
tax procedure code at end 2008, even though several associated regulations are still pending.
A cash management unit was legally created by end 2008 and is implementing a pilot on
monthly payment forecasts with three line ministries. The draft Global Income Tax bill
should be submitted to the Council of Ministers and Parliament in the coming months. The
authorities are in the early stages of restructuring the tax administration. Finally, the Treasury
Single Account legislation is under examination in parliament.

Box 7. Lebanon: Shock Scenarios for Debt Sustainability Analysis
Even with an ambitious debt reduction strategy, Lebanon will remain vulnerable to shocks for
many years. With full implementation of the strategy, primary surpluses (excluding grants) could
reach over 5 percent of GDP over the medium term, and with this, government debt could decline
to around 136 percent of GDP by 2014. However, this scenario is ambitious, and substantial risks to
the downside remain: higher interest rates, lower economic growth, or delays in policy
implementation could imply a renewed increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio.
Panel 1: The baseline scenario—implementation of Paris III reform measures.
Panel 2: A permanent increase in the real interest rate of 220 basis points (i.e., one-half standard
deviation from its past distribution) relative to the baseline.
Panel 3: A permanent decrease in real GDP growth of 1.6 percentage points (i.e., one-half of the
standard deviation from its past distribution).
Panel 4: Limited implementation of the fiscal reforms that would halve the yield from the fiscal
reform package during 2010–14. This implies that the primary surplus would converge to
about 3.0 percent of GDP in 2014 (baseline: 5.8 percent).
Panel 5: Failure to implement a fiscal consolidation process keeping a nil primary balance in 2009
and in the medium term; medium-term growth assumed one percentage point lower than
in the baseline.
Panel 6: No privatization—since privatization essentially brings forward the income stream from
the privatized companies, the scenarios with and without privatization converge to the
same debt ratio in the long run. However, this abstracts from the negative impact that
abandoning privatization plans would have on growth and, possibly, interest rates.

22.
The authorities recognize the need to strengthen the BdL’s balance sheet over
the medium term. The planned fiscal consolidation, together with de-dollarization, will
allow a lowering of interest rates and help strengthen the BdL’s balance sheet. Privatization
of the assets held by the central bank once market conditions permit will also help its
financial balance, while contributing to the government’s growth agenda.
V. OTHER ISSUES
23.
The mission discussed technical assistance (TA) needs and the new charging
policy. The mission stressed that the Fund stands ready to provide assistance particularly in
the areas of public financial management, tax administration, banking regulation/supervision,
Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Combating the Financing of Terrorism (CFT), central
bank reforms, and statistical issues (below). The authorities expressed interest in a possible
FSAP update in the course of 2009.
24.
The authorities are reinforcing their AML/CFT framework. In order to
implement the Special Recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the
authorities are improving the existing AML legislation, which would now also cover CFT.
The amendments increase the powers of Lebanon’s Special Investigative Commission, an
independent financial intelligence unit with judicial status charged with implementing AML,
and stiffen the penalties for AML breaches. Lebanon is currently undergoing an AML/CFT
assessment by MENAFATF (a FATF-style regional body).
25.
The authorities are improving their statistical systems, but significant data
problems remain. With support from INSEE, they are improving the quality of GDP data
and the timeliness of their dissemination, recently publishing national accounts to 2007. In
2008, they have also launched an improved CPI index with the help of TA from the Fund.
However, statistical provision in other areas (balance of payments, employment, wage and
social indicators) remains seriously deficient. The authorities agree that improvement in
statistical systems are essential to support economic analysis and policy making, and the next
government is expected to increase investment in statistical resources.
VI. STAFF APPRAISAL
26.
Achievements: The resilience of the Lebanese economy in the midst of the ongoing
global crisis demonstrates the benefits of macroeconomic policy discipline under the EPCA
and strict oversight on the financial sector. International reserves have hit a record high. The
banking sector has not come under stress. Lebanese Eurobonds have outperformed the
emerging market average. So far, there are not clear signs of slowdown in economic activity.
Thus, Lebanon has been insulated from the global deleveraging process that has hit those
financial systems flushed with high-risk structured products or with a risky funding structure.

23
27.
The EPCA: The quarterly monitoring framework set up in the context of the two
drawings under EPCA has proved to be an effective tool to support the authorities’ efforts to
preserve macroeconomic and financial stability despite the difficult domestic political
conditions and the increasingly challenging external environment. The authorities deserve
merit for having met all quantitative targets with substantial margins. However, while
slippages in the structural reform agenda reflect the domestic and international environment,
a swift implementation of the reform agenda after the elections is necessary to make inroads
toward reducing Lebanon’s vulnerabilities.
28.
Challenges and risks: These successes do not leave scope for complacency. The
deepening global recession and the dysfunctional international credit markets make it even
more urgent for Lebanon to address its still high vulnerabilities. Short-term policies will need
to be geared toward reducing the possible impact from the downward risks to the outlook by
safeguarding the recent progress toward debt sustainability and a stronger external position.
The possible confluence of domestic political uncertainty, regional instability, and the
faltering global economic conditions constitute the main risk. Therefore, both monetary and
fiscal policies need to be prudent, and financial supervision vigilant. Proactive contingency
planning should also top the policy agenda.
29.
Monetary and exchange rate policies: Monetary policy needs to continue to
safeguard the peg, a prerequisite for financial stability given the large currency mismatches
of the government, corporate, and household sectors, and the government’s high debt and
debt service obligations in foreign currency. Staff estimates suggest that the real exchange
rate remains broadly in line with fundamentals. Given the various risks, staff agrees with the
authorities that there is not much scope for lowering interest rates in the near term. This
cautious approach should last at least until the elections to attract deposit inflows, foster dedollarization, and buttress the international-reserve buffer to insure against a confidence
backlash.
30.
Fiscal stance: Lebanon’s high debt level does not leave scope for countercyclical
action. The moderate loosening in the fiscal stance in the 2009 draft budget will bring to a
halt the recent decline in the debt-to-GDP ratio, substantially widen the government overall
deficit, and could complicate government financing in case downside risks to the scenario
materialize. Thus, staff believe that a primary surplus of close to 2 percent of GDP would be
desirable, to preserve the trend toward debt reduction and maintain an unchanged overall
financing requirements in 2009. While the current political circumstances, the likely
slowdown in economic growth, and the soaring wage bill could make it difficult to attain this
target, staff believe that strict expenditure restraint in the run up to the elections and the
implementation of the Paris III fiscal policy package thereafter should aim at achieving a
significantly higher primary balance than envisaged by the draft budget. Staff, therefore,
recommends that any revenue over-performance be saved and any shortfall in capital
spending be preserved.

24
31.
Fiscal rigidities: The spending increase for wages and salaries is likely to absorb the
fiscal space created by the drop in international oil prices and the welcome reintroduction of
the gasoline excise in 2009. While the increase reflects in part the realization of contingent
liabilities and unsustainable wage compression in the past, it adds a substantial budgetary
rigidity and raises fiscal risk. Much of this increase will be permanent, whereas part of the
fiscal space gained through reduced transfers to EdL depends on highly volatile oil prices. A
targeted redirecting of expenditures would help meet the authorities’ social objectives much
more efficiently than generalized wage increases. Careful phasing of expenditures is also
needed to meet the fiscal targets under EPCA.
32.
Contingency planning for government financing: The seizure in international
capital markets and wider fiscal deficit will increase the burden on domestic banks to provide
government financing, at a time of a slowdown in deposit growth. Staff agrees that under
prudent assumptions banks should be able to provide sufficient financing, even in the
absence of funding from international investors. Nevertheless, contingency planning remains
essential to face the risk that election-related political uncertainty and a prolonged global
recession could translate into a more substantial drop in deposit inflows. Staff and the
authorities agree that the appropriate response would include a combination of fiscal
adjustment, a lower pace of reserve accumulation, higher interest rates, and possibly
additional use of Fund resources.
33.
Banking sector: The specific funding and asset structure of banks, backed by
effective banking supervision and regulation, have shielded the Lebanese banking system
from exposure to global liquidity shortages, structured products, and real estate. Looking
forward, continued vigilance is needed, since banks may still be affected by the global
financial crisis, and the slowdown in growth in Lebanon and in the region could raise nonperforming loans, although provisioning and capitalization remain sizeable. The authorities’
heightened focus on the bank resolution framework, including through the implementation of
the merger law, is welcome, as it would help address potential negative effects of the global
financial crisis on Lebanese banks.
34.
The Paris III agenda: The proximity of the general elections and the global financial
crisis has delayed implementation of key structural reforms that supported the debt reduction
objectives of the Paris III agenda. There are three top priorities. First, the energy sector
absorbs an unacceptably high amount of budgetary resources, and dampens Lebanon’s
growth and productivity potential because of its inefficiencies. Despite the drop in
international prices, current tariffs imply a significant untargeted subsidy that needs to be
eliminated. Second, proceeding with the planned privatization of the mobile phone providers
as soon as market conditions allow could go a long way toward promoting private sector
growth and reducing debt-related vulnerabilities. Third, a gradual increase in the VAT rate to
15 percent would be needed to bring primary surpluses to levels that would approach debt
sustainability over the medium term. Implementing these measures may prove to be difficult,
but remains necessary to move towards sustainability. However, even under full

25
implementation of the Paris III agenda, vulnerabilities would decline only gradually and
significant risks would persist for many years.
35.
Donor disbursements: Timely and flexible disbursement of the Paris III pledges is a
key component of the debt reduction strategy. Unfortunately, disbursements have fallen short
of expectations. Progress on the Paris III agenda, on which much of the pledges were
conditioned, should help accelerate disbursements. Staff supports the authorities’ request that
donors provide as much budgetary support as possible.
36.
BdL balance sheet: The decline in international interest rates has highlighted the cost
of maintaining high domestic interest rates to attract inflows and increase reserves. Action is
needed to strengthen the BdL balance sheet. Staff believes the BdL should consider shifting
from issuing higher-yielding securities toward using its large T-bill portfolio as the main tool
for sterilizing excess liquidity. This would lower sterilization costs for the BdL and support
fiscal discipline by making the cost of government financing more transparent. Over time a
stronger fiscal position and reduced dollarization will also help strengthen the BdL balance
sheet.
37.
Data issues: The authorities have improved significantly GDP and CPI statistics.
However, data insufficiencies still hamper the analysis of real and external sector
developments. High-level commitment by the next government and by the BdL is needed to
address these shortcomings through a comprehensive strategy to strengthen statistics.
38.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12-month
cycle.

Sources: Lebanese authorities; and Fund staff projections.
1/ Central government gross debt.
2/ Derived as [(r - p(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; p = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; a = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as ae(1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
7/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.
8/ This path assumes that, from 2009 onwards, real GDP growth is set at its 10-year average level while the primary fiscal balance and real interest rates are the same as in the baseline scenario.
9/ This path assumes that, from 2009 onwards, real interest rate and real GDP growth are set at their 10-year average level while the primary fiscal balance is the same as in the baseline scenario.

Pursuant to Fund policy, the Banque du Liban (BdL) was subject to a full safeguards
assessment in conjunction with the first Emergency Post-Conflict Assistance (EPCA).
The safeguards assessment report, which was completed on March 10, 2008,
recommended several specific measures for enhancing the BdL’s financial reporting,
audit, and control procedures, and the authorities have outlined steps to follow up on
these recommendations. The report also suggested an update of the central bank law.
An update safeguards assessment is currently under way in the context of the second
EPCA.

Technical Assistance

Fiscal area—FAD has provided advice on introducing the VAT, reforming customs tariffs
and income taxes, strengthening tax and customs administration, improving public
expenditure management, and consolidating fiscal accounts. A fiscal ROSC report was
published in May 2005. Considerable needs remain in tax policy, tax administration, budget
preparation, fiscal management, and public accounting and reporting. Technical assistance
missions in 2005 primarily dealt with (i) the consolidation of fiscal accounts, and (ii) public
liquidity management. In October 2006, a multi-sector mission provided advice on fiscal
reform priorities after the conflict with Israel. In November 2007, a FAD mission provided
advice for reforming subsidies and restoring gasoline excises. During 2007 and early 2008,
FAD and the Middle East Technical Assistance Center (METAC) also provided targeted
follow-up support to ongoing initiatives in both tax administration and public financial
management (e.g., tax audit program. Treasury Single Account, and cash management).
Financial area—Over the past few years, the now Monetary and Capital Markets
Department has provided technical assistance in the areas of the payments system and
vulnerability indicators. The related missions undertook an assessment of compliance with
Core Principles for Systemically Important Payments Systems, advised on developing
systems to improve efficiency and liquidity management in public sector payments and
receipts, and assisted in the elaboration of a framework for collecting and analyzing
macro-prudential indicators to develop capacity to monitor systemic financial sector
vulnerabilities. Progress in implementing IMF recommendations has been limited. In 2006, a
mission conducted an assessment of banking sector soundness, including a stress-test
exercise, with a view to developing a strategy for banking sector consolidation.

4

Statistical area—The Statistics Department has provided technical assistance in national
accounts, price and balance of payments statistics. There is no official producer price index
(PPI); and balance of payments data remain incomplete. During 2007, several missions on
the consumer price index (CPI) were undertaken through the METAC. As a result, in
March 2008 a new monthly country-wide CPI was launched. A METAC-STA mission in
October–November 2008 has provided assistance on national accounts statistics and
economic surveys. In March 2008, a METAC mission provided technical assistance on
balance of payments and international investment position statistics. Nevertheless, statistical
gaps remain substantial, particularly in the areas of national accounts, price statistics, and the
balance of payments. Stronger political commitment to filling these gaps is needed in order
for further technical assistance to be effective.

ANNEX III. LEBANON—STATISTICAL ISSUES
As of March 12, 2009
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has serious shortcomings that significantly hamper surveillance. In particular,
there are serious issues in the compilation of the national accounts, employment, general government
and the rest of the nonfinancial public sector, and balance of payments.
National Accounts: The national accounts data are weak. Despite technical assistance from the
French National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies, the Central Administration of Statistics
(CAS) still does not have the capacity to produce national accounts statistics in line with accepted
international standards. National accounts (now up to 2007) are instead produced in the Prime
Minister’s office. STA is assisting the authorities to produce national accounts estimates based on a
comprehensive data collection program and the 2004 economic survey.
Price statistics: Since May 2008, CAS compiles and disseminates a monthly Consumer Price Index
(CPI) following international accepted methodology. The CPI is disseminated within three weeks after
the end of the reference month. Geographical coverage is expanded to include all areas in Lebanon
(a previous CAS index was based on prices collected from Beirut and its suburbs).
Government finance statistics: Fiscal statistics are weak. Published monthly data on the central
government budgetary accounts are not comprehensive, omit certain transfers, financing data, and
foreign-financed capital expenditure, and do not cover arrears. Certain (treasury) spending is only
identified ex-post, and its economic classification with a lag. However, these items are provided to the
staff in the context of surveillance activities. Government finance statistics are on a cash basis, with a
modified cash cash-basis for budgetary expenditure data, corresponding to the issue of payment
orders. In addition, there are no data on the widespread quasi-fiscal activities conducted by public
corporations.
Monetary and financial statistics: Monetary statistics are adequate. At the same time,
sectoralization of institutional units and classification of financial instruments in the data reported to
STA fall significantly short of what is needed for compilation of Standardized Report Forms (SRFs).
The lack of a reliable classification of deposits by residency complicates the balance of payments
analysis. The reporting of monetary data to STA is irregular and occurs with a three- to four-month
lag.
Balance of payments: The balance of payments statistics are weak. The data reflect deficiencies in
the current account (unrecorded exports, underestimation of private sector services and workers’
remittances), the capital account (grants), and the financial account (equity investment in the nonbank
private sector, and corporate borrowing abroad). Coverage of foreign direct investment transactions
remains limited. Lack of effective interagency cooperation, and staff constraints at both Banque du
Liban (BDL) and CAS are among the main factors impeding progress.

II. Data Standards and Quality
Participant in the General Data Dissemination
System since January 2003. Metadata and the
plans for improving the real and fiscal statistics
need to be updated.

No data ROSC is available.

IMF Executive Board Concludes
2009 Article IV Consultation with Lebanon
On April 15, 2009, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Lebanon.1
Background
The Lebanese financial system has so far weathered the global financial crisis. Deposit inflows
decelerated briefly in the aftermath of the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy, but have resumed at a
rapid pace since then, and deposit dollarization has been declining steadily. Consequently, the
Bank of Lebanon (BdL) has continued to accumulate international reserves at a swift pace.
Eurobond spreads have come down markedly since spiking following the Lehman bankruptcy,
and are now below the emerging market average. Helped by strict financial oversight, the
domestic financial system has had very little exposure to distressed financial products or
markets and remains liquid.
Despite its vulnerabilities, the Lebanese economy has shown a remarkable macroeconomic
performance. Lebanon’s public debt-to-GDP ratio remains very high, its large banking system is
highly exposed to the sovereign and dependent on nonresident deposit inflows, and the country
lies at the crossroads of regional political tensions. Nonetheless, Lebanon has achieved a
strong macroeconomic performance, helped by prudent policies and an improvement of the
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
political and security situation after the May 2008 Doha agreement. Real GDP growth exceeded
8 percent in 2008. CPI inflation dropped to 4 percent in January 2009, down from the double
digits briefly reached last summer in the wake of soaring international food and fuel prices. With
a primary fiscal balance of 0.5 percent of GDP, the debt-to-GDP ratio declined by 6 percentage
points to 162 percent of GDP in 2008. All end-December quantitative targets under the
Emergency Post-Conflict Assistance -supported program were met with substantial margins.
The global recession and tight international capital markets weigh on the economic and financial
outlook. Lower global liquidity and economic growth, particularly in the Gulf, are likely to affect
merchandise exports, tourism, remittances, foreign direct and portfolio investment, and deposit
inflows. Economic growth in Lebanon is likely to slow to 3 percent this year, and deposit growth
could decline to about 10 percent from over 15 percent in 2008. Nonetheless, helped by a
reduced oil import bill and ongoing deposit dedollarization, international reserves are likely to
increase further. Inflation will likely remain low, in line with international price trends.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the remarkable resilience of the Lebanese economy in the face
of the global financial crisis, and commended the authorities for their macroeconomic policy
discipline and strict oversight of the financial system. Their implementation of the program
supported by EPCA has contributed to a strong economic and financial performance and a
reduction in the government debt-to-GDP ratio.
Directors considered that the deepening global recession, unsettled international credit markets,
and Lebanon’s exposure to regional spillovers underscore the importance of making further
progress in addressing Lebanon’s macroeconomic and financial vulnerabilities. Near-term
policies should aim at mitigating downside risks by safeguarding the recent progress made
toward achieving debt sustainability and strengthening the external position. This will involve
continued prudent fiscal and monetary policies, vigilant financial supervision, proactive
contingency planning, and a resumption of the Paris III reform policy agenda to reduce
structural vulnerabilities.
Directors supported the authorities’ monetary policy aimed at safeguarding the exchange rate
peg and facilitating a further buildup of international reserves. The large currency mismatches in
the debt held by the governmental, corporate, and household sectors, along with the high level
of government foreign currency debt and debt-service obligations, underscore the central role
played by the peg in maintaining financial stability. Given heightened near-term risks, Directors
agreed that there is little scope for lowering interest rates over the coming months. They took
note of the staff assessment that the real effective exchange rate of the Lebanese pound
appears to be broadly in line with fundamentals.
Directors cautioned that Lebanon's still very-high level of government debt and the need to
support the exchange rate peg leave little room for countercyclical fiscal policy. A number of
Directors encouraged the authorities to aim for a higher primary fiscal surplus than implied in
the draft budget to reduce the debt burden, while a few others saw the planned pause in fiscal

3
consolidation as justified by the slowdown in economic activity. Directors recommended that
any revenue overperformance or capital spending shortfall in the 2009 budget be saved. They
were encouraged by the authorities' assurance that implementation of the 2009 budget will be
prudent, and their readiness to consider additional measures if needed to maintain the
government debt-to-GDP ratio unchanged, and ensure government financing in the event of a
shortfall in deposit inflows.
Directors welcomed the reintroduction of gasoline excise taxes, which will help bolster the
revenue position. They considered that carefully targeting social expenditures would lead to a
more efficient allocation of public resources and achieve social and development objectives
better than generalized public sector wage increases.
Directors were encouraged by the resilience and profitability of the banking sector in the face of
the global crisis. They commended the authorities for their prudent regulation and supervision of
the sector, and the progress they have made in strengthening the bank resolution framework. At
the same time, banks’ large exposure to the sovereign, maturity mismatches, and the still-high
degree of dollarization constitute vulnerabilities. Directors therefore stressed the need for
continued vigilance in bank regulation and supervision.
Directors considered that progress on structural reforms under the Paris III reform agenda,
especially in the energy sector, will warrant heightened attention in the period ahead. This
should include a revision of electricity tariffs to ensure cost recovery, which will boost Lebanon’s
growth potential and reduce a large drain on budgetary resources. The privatization of the
mobile telecommunications providers as soon as market conditions allow would promote private
sector growth and reduce debt-related vulnerabilities. Directors underscored that fiscal reforms,
including an increase in the VAT, will be needed to achieve the desired sizeable primary fiscal
surplus in the medium term. They stressed the importance of timely and full disbursement of
donor commitments to support Lebanon’s reform agenda, including through the provision of
budgetary support.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by Shakour Shaalan, Executive Director for Lebanon
April 15, 2009
1.
On behalf of the Lebanese authorities, I would like to express my appreciation to
staff, Management, and the Executive Board for their continued constructive engagement
with Lebanon. The authorities appreciated the helpful discussions with staff during the
mission, which focused on preserving financial and economic stability in the near term, while
pursuing the Paris III objectives of continued debt reduction and structural reforms over the
medium term.
Recent Developments and Outlook
2.
Lebanon’s economy has thus far shown significant resilience to the ongoing global
financial and economic crisis. Underpinned by sound macroeconomic policies and an
improved political and security environment, real GDP growth exceeded 8 percent in 2008,
driven by construction and tourism. Inflation declined to 4 percent in January 2009, after
having reached double digits last summer on account of high international food and fuel
prices. Moreover, the authorities made further progress toward fiscal consolidation, with a
realization of a primary fiscal surplus of 0.5 percent of GDP and a lowering of the
debt-to-GDP ratio by 6 percentage points to 162 percent in 2008. At the same time, deposit
inflows continued to increase at a rapid pace after decelerating briefly following the Lehman
Brothers bankruptcy, deposit dollarization declined steadily, and the Banque du Liban (BdL)
continued to rapidly accumulate international reserves. Against this background, all
end-December 2008 quantitative targets under the Emergency Post-Conflict Assistance
(EPCA)-supported program were met with substantial margins. Implementation of the
structural reform agenda was slow, however, reflecting the approach of the general elections
set for June this year, as well as a difficult international environment for privatization.
3.
Notwithstanding this remarkable performance, a worsening of the global financial
and economic outlook, particularly in the Gulf, will adversely weigh on Lebanon’s economic
prospects for 2009, in terms of lower receipts from tourism, remittances, foreign direct and
portfolio investment, and deposit inflows. The authorities are well aware of the potential
risks stemming from a slowdown in deposit growth, as domestic banks contribute to a large
extent to financing the country’s fiscal deficits. Accordingly, the authorities’ policy
objectives in the near term are to minimize the possible impact of the aforementioned risks
by further building international reserves, safeguarding fiscal achievements, containing
financing needs, and strengthening the banking sector. They remain fully committed to the
objectives of the EPCA, which provides macroeconomic and financial discipline to their
policy framework while anchoring progress towards structural reforms. They also remain
committed to the implementation of the Paris III reform agenda over the medium term,
particularly in the areas of fiscal consolidation, the privatization of the telecommunications
sector, and the reform of the energy sector. At the same time, continued strong international

2
support remains essential to help Lebanon reduce its economic vulnerabilities. In particular,
it is important that donors fully carry through their financial commitments made at the
Paris III conference, in a timely fashion. The authorities continue to actively seek flexibility
from donors to convert project loans pledges into budgetary support to further reduce the
debt burden. They appreciate the support shown by the Fund in this regard.
Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
4.
The monetary policy framework has helped maintain confidence in the Lebanese
financial system. The exchange rate peg continues to serve the economy well by providing a
firm anchor to financial stability. It has proved crucial in this regard, given balance sheet
risks related to widespread dollarization and the government’s high foreign currency debt
servicing obligations. The authorities agree with staff’s assessment that the real exchange
rate remains broadly in line with fundamentals.
5.
Mindful of continued strains in the global financial outlook, the BdL aims at further
strengthening its international reserves buffer to preserve confidence and support deposit
growth. This would be achieved by maintaining the interest rate differential between
domestic currency and foreign currency rates at the current level. Admittedly, given the
decline in international interest rates, the policy of reserve accumulation entails a high cost
for the BdL balance sheet. Once more stable and predictable market conditions prevail, the
central bank should be in a better position to consider a further reduction in domestic
currency interest rates when deposit growth stabilizes at a comfortable pace. Going forward,
fiscal adjustment and improved confidence in the economy would help reduce dollarization,
which would facilitate a further build-up of net international reserves and strengthen the
BdL’s income position.
Fiscal Policy and Reforms
6.
The budget for 2009 has been framed against the background of an expected
slowdown in economic activity and the associated potential increase in social needs.
Accordingly, the draft budget (expected to be submitted to Parliament in the near future)
envisages a balanced primary account and a gross debt-to-GDP ratio that remains constant at
162 percent. Fiscal space is being created through the reintroduction of gasoline excises, the
reduced need for budgetary transfers to Electricité du Liban resulting from lower fuel costs,
the delayed privatization of the mobile phone companies, and the implementation of revenue
measures envisaged under EPCA. These additional resources would help finance the increase
in spending on wages and salaries that has been approved last year, as well as much needed
higher capital expenditures. The authorities are fully committed to the EPCA’s fiscal targets.
Accordingly, implementation of the 2009 budget will be prudent, and the authorities stand
ready to consider additional measures if needed to achieve the budgetary objectives. The
authorities have also prepared a contingency anti-crisis plan aimed at boosting economic
activity, with minimal effects on the fiscal balance.

3
7.
Important progress has been made in the area of budgetary reforms. Parliament
approved the tax procedure code at end-2008. A cash management unit was also established,
and is undertaking a pilot project on monthly payment forecasts with three line ministries.
The draft Global Income Tax law should be submitted to the Council of Ministers and
Parliament in the coming months. The restructuring of the tax administration has been
initiated, and the Treasury Single Account legislation is under examination in Parliament.

Despite the likely slowdown in deposit growth, the authorities expect to meet
the 2009 financing needs from the market. However, should the approach of the elections or
a protracted global recession lead to a critical drop in deposit inflows, the authorities stand
ready to respond appropriately with a combination of measures, including fiscal adjustment,
a lower pace of reserve accumulation, higher interest rates, and possibly additional use of
Fund resources.
Financial Sector

Effective regulation and supervision, coupled with a deposit-based funding structure,
have shielded the domestic financial sector from exposure to international financial risks, and
thus from the effects of the global financial crisis. Nevertheless, in the wake of the crisis, the
Banking Control Commission (BCC) has strengthened reporting requirements on domestic
and foreign operations, carried out stress tests for the banking system, and intensified on-site
inspections. Moreover, the BdL has recently recommended limiting dividend payments to
25 percent of 2008 profits in order to further enhance the already high bank capitalization.
Finally, the authorities have prepared a draft legislation for the creation of the regulatory
authority for financial markets. They further reinforced the banking resolution framework
with the adoption of a revised bank merger law aimed at preventing to the extent possible
bank failures by encouraging mergers and takeovers by sounder banks instead. Plans to
reform the deposit insurance fund are also underway.
